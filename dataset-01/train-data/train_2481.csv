2,Wish I could say better things...,This type of video is right down my alley however I had to give this one a low rating. Not because of the content - it was very interesting - but because of the video quality. I understand that in the '60s we did not have all the HD equipment available today however I feel the quality is bad even for that time period. I don't regret buying or watching the video but I also would not recommend it to anyone who is not very interested in the subject. Just saying this so you are aware of what you are getting before you lay out the cash.
1,picture book,"I was disappointed in this photo album. Displayed a bunch of pictures and then in the back it discussed the picture. Obviously, this is a part of New York that should stay invisible."
3,Disappointed,"I was trying to find a book that showed the hidden infrastructure of New York City but how they did it all, pictures of constructions and information how how in the world they have done what they have done, amazing! These pictures and this book is okay but just not what I was looking for."
3,Good coffee table book; browse before you buy,Great coffee table book of little-seen aspects of NYC. One warning I'd mention is that not all of the pictures are of things underground/unseen. Some are simply of neglected/abandonded/decaying above ground sites (not exactly what I'd expected but it's still a good collection). Perhaps it would be best to peruse this book at your local bookseller before making a decision on the purchase.
3,Seems incomplete,"Nice book, beautiful photography. But seems to miss out on the opportunity to present many more of the iconic structures of New York."
4,Classic Lalo from the '70s and '80s.,"This compilation of Lalo's big hits undoubtedly focuses on his big Salsa Romantica hits (""Si Te Menti"", ""Amame"", ""No Tuve Nadie"", ""Despues De Hacer El Amor"", ""Ven Devorame Otra Vez"",etc.) but the producers also chose to (thankfully) include two tracks from his years with Eddie Palmieri (""Oyelo Que Te Conviene"" and the majestic ""Un Dia Bonito"") and two Frank Ferrer-produced tracks ""Francisco Andante"" and ""Maximo Chamorro"")--thus rounding out the compilation very nicely. The sound quality is not uniformly good on all 12 tracks but this is a CD which any fan of 1980s Salsa will enjoy."
4,"""Enhanced"" ??","This ""enhanced"" release includes the MAGIX playR program for sounds & video mix & remix as well as some unreleased and hard to find tracks. If you like deep house that's off the beaten path - you'll like this."
5,Dog Walker is a terrific read!,"This book was a page turner from start to finish. Two very late nights and two very tired mornings later I can say without pause how pleased I was to have a thriller be so full, exciting, and different. I was beginning to believe that the publishing industry had decided that 'thrillers' did not really need a STORY to go along with the thrills. Well, I can assure you, DOG WALKER has story, thrills, great characters, and a few extras that I won't ruin here--you'll have to discover those for yourself. I give this book a five+ rating and can't wait for his next one."
4,Mystery and mysticism combined,"I purchased Dog Walker at a recent book signing where I also met the author Heath Kizzier. Intrigued by the author's description of the book, I was not dissappointed. The story line is well developed and the characters a fully defined. The action is carefully measured with just the right amount of surprises. Justice prevails as the good guy wins and the bad guys get theirs. Just the way I like it."
5,A great pocket book on Japanese Poems involving love and longing.,"As a lifetime student of the Japanese martial arts, including the poetic forms of the Japanese and Asian poets, I found this pocket book edition very interesting and beautiful. The translator decided to research the Japanese Tanke poem form for this volume. The 160 pages contain a variety of beautiful poems you are sure to enjoy. For the most part, Japanese poems are short and concise. In fact, one Japanese poetry form I am quite familiar with is Haiku, which is a short three line poem.One example of the treasures in this volume is as follows:""Autumn has returned:multicolored fallen leavescarpet the garden,and the long path lies buried:no visitor wades those drifts.""In conclusion, if you like Japanese poetry you will love this collection of poems.This is a book you will go back to often to again experience the joy of these poems.Rating: 5 Stars Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Haiku Moments: How to read, write and enjoy Haiku)."
5,The Best,"This is the best and most complete guide to West Coast wines. Unfortunately, no new edition since 1995. On the other hand, nothing that has come out in the past 10 years can approach it. If they put out a new edition it would be a must have for anyone who buys CA or Oregon wines, not to mention wine geeks."
2,This IS the worst Animorphs book...,"I'm giving it two stars (one was for the book, and the other was for the cover, which I liked) This book didn't really appeal to me, like all the other Animorph books. The first Alternamorphs was better than this one."
2,OK,"I thought this book was all right. I didn't like the way it just repeated breifly the events that had already taken place in the series, though. It was like reading a weird summary that misses lots of points. However, I do like to choose morphs, etc, so it was okay"
4,Written to help the clinician,"The last decades have seen important advances in the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of several diseases. These advances have led to promising new treatment and made it all the more important for the clinician to establish the diagnosis. These book attempt to aid the physician in this endeavor This book is intended for medical interested in the practical, clinical use of comprehensive tests in the diagnostic evaluation and management of patient with neurologic deseases. All aspects of the test are covered in detail, including techniques of performing the tests, data analyses, variations and clinical correlation."
4,wowwwwww,"i'm shocked she hasn't had much exposure. basically if you like Kate Havenik, Imogen Heap, and bjork...Etc you'll love this. i don't know who it's produced by but it sound like guy sigsworth..i'm ordering my copy asap."
3,Not my favorite of the author's books,"This is the 17th book I have read by Diane Chamberlain since last summer. Each book has drawn me in immediately and effortlessly and I finished within a few days. This is the first book she has written that didn't do that for me. I started it and set it aside due to lack of interest and just picked it up a few days ago and finished. It started to get better about a third of the way through. The ending was strange and abrupt. The author tells about going through a divorce at the end of the book, during it's writing. That must be why this book isn't of her usual caliber."
4,Kept my Attention,"Although there was the unbelievabily of the stranger coming to town to make it rain, the characters were good and I felt well developed. My only complaint was the ""rainmaker"" story and how it ended up. For so long we knew he was running from something and then when it is discovered why, it is anti climactic. I wanted something with a bigger ""wow"" factor and didn't feel it was described as well as it could have been. Overall, it was a really great read. And now I am starting another one."
5,Can't go wrong!,"I discovered Diane Chamberlain by accident. Boy was that my lucky day.. Love love love her books. Some, of course, slightly better than others but regardless of which one you choose, you will not be disappointed. Always an AHAH moment. I'm actually worried I'll run out of her books. Keep writing Diane!"
4,A Must Have,Superb collection of French songs that evoke being in Paris. A must have or the perfect gift for the person needing a vacation to Paris or the exchange student returning from the Sorbonne.
3,"Selected stories, and not history of military intelligence","If you happen to like the selected examples, fine,but if you are looking into some analytical or bird's eye view of military intelligence,you will be dearly disappointed."
5,Military Intel,Excellent book. Well written and researched. The author uses specific examples from history. The book is easy to read and interesting.
5,Music with a message,"I purchased this Music CD to be used at my brothers Celebration of life in conjunction withMicrosoft movie maker. The song that I used out of this album was ""He Ain't heavy he's my brother"".I used it with my pic's of my brother and me growing up in the Northwest --the time span was 65 years.Great song by the Hollies."
5,Purchase of The Hollies Greatest Hits CD,"I've always loved The Hollies, and after being reminded Graham Nash was originally one of the members, I sought out a collection that covered a large span of their recording career. The two-disc set did not disappoint. It arrived promptly and in good condition. It contains all the songs I was familiar with from the radio, as well as a number of gems I was largely unaware of. Highly recommend it!"
4,Great Tunes - Many I Never Heard.,"This 2-disc set is definitely worth having. It has all of the Hollies hits, plus many tracks you'd only know if you were a Hollies fanatic. These guys could sing! Some of the 3 & 4 part harmonies remind me of the Beach Boys work, and it is also clear that Graham Nash brought that influence to bear when he joined Crosby, Stills and Nash (& sometimes Neil Young). I am thoroughly enjoying this 2-disc set!"
4,Great!,I am a casual fan of Hollies and this double-CD have all the greatest musics from their career. Great!
1,Stilted and Annoying,"There is so much wrong with this book that it's hard to know where to start. I'll keep it brief: the hero is a jerk, the heroine has no spine or pride, the dialogue sounds phony, all the personal interactions are stilted, there is no emotional chemistry and it is all ""tell, don't show"" from the start. The ""flashbacks"" to get the backstory are just plain irritating and in fact the whole book is; and it feels dated. I didn't sense any real connection between the characters and feel vaguely resentful that I wasted as much time as I did trying to figure out why so many people claimed to love this book. I don't get it. I tried. I'd recommend staying away from this one."
2,not this time,"I'm normally very forgiving of escapist, fun, breezy romances, but this book is seriously, even unforgivably, flawed. The cliched backgrounds of the characters (has anyone ever gone through childhood unmolested??) paired against a contrived storyline and then followed by an ending that grew progressively more ridiculous made me want to toss the book into the junk pile. Not recommended."
1,Not all that good,"This show was boring, the acting was bad, and some of the scenes didn't make a whole lot of sense. I thought this was going to be a stellar movie with some action scenes, but it's just two women trying to pretend to cry. The acting is really bad...and the story line should have been written better to make the movie more believable."
5,Bio Freeze Samples,Love the samples. i can carry them in my purse so if I have pain while I am not at home I am able to use the samples and I always carry extras just in case I need to share. This product is great for pain.
4,For Soccer bruises,"Was told about this by a trainer for the Galaxy. The ointment works well on sparins and bruises, do use as suggested."
5,operation safe drinking water,I purchased this product as a donation to a mission in Panama. The product has been very much appreciated in the past so I do what i can by donating it to them. I also use it myself and like it very much. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for muscle relief. The reason I buy the sample packs for the mission is for convenienceBIOFREEZE with ILEX Pain Relieving Gel - 5 Gram Packs -Dispenser Box 100 per Box. I personally like the roll-on.
4,Another solid drill,"I've been pleased with this drill's solid construction and excellent torque and speed control. I've used it a few times for concrete and it's done very well (easy switch masonry-wood, good power). Overall, it will drill holes in most wood types like they're a stick of butter.It might be a little heavy for sustained overhead work, but that's a minor nit."
4,Drill great - carrying case is terrible,"The drill is great. It drills holes in concrete and masonry effortlessly and accurately. It's powerful and reliable.But, the case is terrible. It's flimsy and the clips that hold it shut are destined to break apart within a few months. I rely on a tool's case to protect it during storage and transport to and around jobsites - this case doesn't cut it."
5,"Quality hammer drill, plenty of power",Well made in Switzerland and works well. I had no problem drilling 3/8 holes thru brick. Very happy with this product
3,Not bad.,"The drill has reasonable power. However, it gets hot easily. Also, the side handle doesn't tighten too well. The gear box is a great feature, however."
4,Strong drill,"I bought this because my Makita drill couldn't keep up. This drill is much more powerful. I don't use the depth gauge so that was no problem. The case does look cheap. I sat and worked the clips that hold the case closed back and forth expecting them to break. They didn't, that doesn't mean they are good though. The variable speed quit under heavy use. Still for the price I think it was a good buy and would do it again."
5,Great Song,"Why, you may ask, do I say ""great song"" not ""great album"", cuz for the most part of this almost-40-minute album, you're hearing the melody. Luckily, it IS a catchy melody. This was the first Rez album I had heard, and it got me hooked. The music is very listenable and the lyrics are derranged! =) I recommend it to everyone!"
3,got Milk?!?,"These guys are friggin strange! This album was surprisingly good. Considering the thrashing it has taken from some of the reviewers, I went in not expecting much. Every song begins with the same melody but ends with the same different melody. Its hard to explain. In between those melodies is your typical Residents' style that doesn't fail. Not their best, and certainly not their worst (I think Eskimo REALLY sucks)."
2,not the best album of the residents,"this album is not so bad, if you are a die hard residents fan, buy it, but i don't like because it's every time the same melody(it is a very good melody) i have it and i have not listen to it very much. You better buy : NOT AVAILABLE or THE COMMERCIAL ALBUM or ICKY FLIX, it's also available here on amazon and those album are much greater!!!"
1,Deserves a Couple of Negative Stars,"Look somewhere else for your strategy fix. I was desperate for something new and bought this game, even though I couldn't find any reviews of it. My money was wasted.So much is so very wrong with this game. For brevity I'll give one example: for your global empire, running in realtime, you have a jump-map of the world about the size of your thumbprint. You hear that there is an attack on, say Montreal, and you have to pick a point in the NW North America, about the size of the head of a thumbtack, click then hunt around for the frickin city you need to find. Then you have to jump to southern Europe and hunt for another city. It is exhausting and stupid - like many other features of this game."
1,Just stopped working and no web support could be found,"I loved this game, although I agree with the last reviewer that it can be difficult to jump around. You have to watch for the red flashes to know where things are happening. Some time ago, it simply stopped working. I attribute this to some Windows patch that I applied at the time, but I have been unable to find any support for this game at all.Even the web page for the game itself is non-functioning, so I have to assume that Microids went out of business or something. So, great game if you can get it to work, but support is horrible."
1,awful,"The story was dumb, offensive and not the least bit entertaining. Not one interesting or likeable character."
3,this movie is ok,it borrows heavy from the anime ghost in the shell.all in all not bad.bobbi phillips is soooo fine for a white women
4,Look good on 06 Civic,"On the plus side, these deflectors WERE rather easy to install. Not quite the 5 second ""fit and pop"" install you'll find on some video reviews, at least not on my Civic that is, but once installed I have to admit they looked pretty sharp. It is important though that you DO roll the windows up and down several times to make sure they are properly seated.Now.. on the negative side, I have to be honest here, the actual ""wind deflecting"" ability they proved wasn't all that impressive to me.. at least not on an 06 Civic that is. Over all though, depending on how well they hold up through weather extremes etc. over time, I give em a 4 star rating. Just wish they actually DEFLECTED WIND better."
5,The Best Side window reflectors,Worth every penny. Very easy to install. No special tools required other than a tape measure. Look fantastic and very professional. A real quality product
5,Beautiful book,"Little Krishna captures the essence of the birth of krishna, his childhood, & end of Kansa. The illustrations are a work of art indeed. The language used is simple and not harsh, easy on the minds of young children, although at some places the harshness cannot be avoided. The book is laid out in small chapters, so one can read as few or as many stories as they wish at a time. One can even skip some stories, as it does not affect the flow of the story. I would highly recommend the book for all parents who want to explore and teach young kids about Little Krishna"
3,"Beautiful, but painful!","I fell in love with the style and color of this shoe, but when I tried to walk in them at home, I was in pain. I had to return them, but have ordered another, higher quality pump, i.e. Joy Chen ""Cruz"" which I haven't received yet...will review those ASAP."
3,Addition Can Be Fun,"Dealing with Addition takes the fun of playing cards and teaches addition. Long lays out an entire deck of cards around her pages and explains how they can be categorized by color, shape and number. Her clear, concise explanations allows the young reader to understand the many functions of playing cards and learn addition at the same time. As she lays out different sets of cards she demonstrates how to add the cards together to reach the numbers from 1 to 10. At the end of the book, she introduces the reader to a card game, ""Dealing with Addition."" This book is best read with a deck of playing cards nearby, as the young reader will undoubtedly want to try their hand at manipulating the cards."
5,A Great Refresher,"I purchased the Desk Reference to study for my MSW licensure exam. It's filled with the entire scope of social work practice and it's organized in a way that the subjects connect and related well to each other. It's easy to investigate the many aspects of social work. A few more specifics and slightly more detailed articles would have been great. But those are small complaints. Overall, a great resource!"
5,An absolute must for people in social work,This is an invaluable compendium. Many mini-articles about subjects relevant to those of us in social work. Also great for use as a study guide for the LCPC. Worth every penny.
3,Excellant,"The reference is an up-to-date educational book that all social workers' should own. I found the desk reference to have helpful information to assist the professionals' in their future learnings'.Ron Lira, MSW"
4,great,yes it was terricif. good for all purpose reference . will be glad to have it on my desk. thanks
3,"Good documentary, NOT related to ""Saving Pvt.Ryan""","This is a good shot of what WWII was in the ETO for a Brit in a tank outfit, but it has no connection to the story ""Saving Pt.Ryan""which is the story of US soldiers. The real life ""Pvt Ryan""was a member of the 506 Para.Inf., 101st Airborne Div.""signed""- Jim Norene, veteran of 101s A/B Div., 1944."
3,Good movie. Crapy story. 3 stars.,"I must say, that I've never seen better waract than in this film. But come on... can you truly say that the story in it is realistic or even close. This is another Hollywood spoiled movie wich gives a good start but the worst kind of end that this movie could have.The war scenes are definetly worth 3 stars and they are the reason why this movie should be watched!"
5,The best movie about the Overlord operation,"Steven Spielberg is the master. The way it was shoot was incredible. It's a really geat movie, the scene of the landing is breath taking. It's the best film I have ever watched."
2,This is not Tom Hanks 1999's best picture.,"Don't make the mistake I did by thinking that this is the film staring Tom Hanks; you know, the one that has Private Ryan in the title in addition to Normandy Beachhead and the film that almost won the Best Picture award. They now have my mistaken donation."
3,"Never seen it, actually.","Just wanted to mention that neither one of the two idiots above have also never seen it. They are apparently speaking of ""Saving Private Ryan"", the film starring Tom Hanks. This film... is clearly NOT that most beautiful war movie."
1,THIS IS NOT SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,"ACTUALLY, I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE ABOUT THE NILAND BROTHERS, BUT SOME OF YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE. THIS FILM DOES NOT STAR TOM HANKS AND IS NOT DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE OTHER VIEWERS WERE A BIT HARSH, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW. THIS IS NOT ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"" THAT FILM STARING TOM HANKS AND TOM SIZEMORE WILL BE RELEASED ON NOVEMBER 2, WHICH IS TODAY. I'M GLAD YOU TOOK THE TIME TO READ MY REVIEW, I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY THE MOVIE AND MAYBE BUY ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"". I HOPE I'M NOT TOO HARSH, THANK YOU."
1,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,Not the film that I was so hoping for. They suckered me in and now I'm stuck with this lemon. Maybe I can unload it at a garage sale.
5,Celestial band on their own wavelength!,"If your into anything psychedelic from the 60's or the Velvet Underground with Nico, you'll love this! I even hear some Bauhaus/Love and Rockets/Syd Barrett/Jesus and Mary Chain influences in many songs??? I bought this band's 2 LP's by chance in the late 80's when they first came out and feel blessed that I kept these rarities. I wish they continued making more music. I'm happy this CD came out because I no longer own a record player and can listen to these songs once again. Check out this link if you want to hear a song by this band. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw4haENBCH8 The songs sound as good today as when I first bought them. I don't write many reviews here but felt compelled to write this one. Any one with info on this band that isn't already posted on the internet please share. I highly recommend The Revolving Paint Dream."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this and the Grandmother Remembers books for my parents as a Christmas present (at the time I was expecting my first baby, their first grandchild). Both books were really big hits! The trick is getting them to actually go though and fill everything out though. Hopefully, they'll finish before Sophia is their age... =]"
3,Use is limited,"while this book was very well put together, it really only applies to traditional households. If there were any divorces or anything out of the ordinary, I think it would be awkward to give to the grandparents."
3,Better for Children,"My husband and his grandfather are about 3/4 of the way through this book. It has allowed for many great conversations and memories, and his grandfather has really enjoyed it.Pros:-Good questions, especially near the end of the book - it answers some more personal questions that otherwise may not come up in general conversation.Cons:-Some questions are redundant or childish.-This is not a keepsake book; although it's hardcover, the pages aren't the best quality for writing on or pasting pictures. In fact the moment I received it I knew I would only be using it for the questions and general layout. After we're done with the book, I am planning to make my own keepsake scrapbook with his answers and pictures.In sum, I would buy it again because the price is good for the questions and layout. However I won't be using it as an actual keepsake book."
3,Great memories preserved!,"If you are a grandparent or even if your the parent trying to keep memories for your children, this is a great book! I am helping my kid's by getting all these great facts about their grandpa. They are already interested in all the discussions that have came up because of it, I can't imagine how great it will be when they are grown!"
5,My father loved this,"I wish I could say for sure it was good-but I haven't seen it yet. My parents live 6,000 miles away,so I can only go by what was told to me. I know my dad was touched that I bought it for him for father's day and that it looks really nice. I hope to see it in the near future (filled out,of course). We're going home next year,hopefully I'll remember to askt o see it. I'll post more when I do."
1,it's fake,it's fake. if came from malaysia. it has different color and shape what features descrived.
1,product was old,it has a ransedity taste...like soap...i don't think i'd order any candy from this company again
2,Not for the Tall or people with long strides,"I picked this up as my wife had done research on it but never used one. In the store it seemed ""ok"" but how much can you really ""stroll"" in the store. After getting it home and using it a few times I realized that the handles where about 2 inched lower (shorter) than I realy would have liked and that I nearly kicked the wheels when I walked (I'm 5'10"") with a slow pace. My wife on the other hand is 5'6"" but is a fast walker and she can't walk behind the stroller without kicking the wheels and she feels like the handles are too low.We both love fact that it's compact and even don't mind that the basket is so small that it's nearly useless except for the smallest of ""day bags"" but the low handle and short distance to the wheels makes us wish we hadden't gotten it. I'm not sure what the return policy is for slightly used strollers, but I hope we can take it back for something else."
2,Beware Tall Parent!,"I bought this stroller because it has such good reviews for a reasonable price.Indeed it looks great - love that color! -, maneuvers well, is very light to push and carry. Sure, the aluminium frame may seem a bit flimsy, but that's the trade-off for a light stroller...It wasn't until I took my daughter for a ride that i realized its major flaw: the handles are way to low for someone 6 feet tall like me. And yes, I had tried it in the store... but not long enough, and not on hilly terrain.So if you or your spouse are less than 6 feet, go ahead, it's a great buy. Otherwise, stay away..."
4,Great lightweight stroller!!!,"It's a wonderful stroller. Very portable, compact & easy to maneuver. I plan to use it traveling for vacations & of course, day to day errands as well. I have the Jeep liberty stroller that I only plan to use in & around our development or when my husband can carry it since it's over 35 lbs. ;) The cosmo is definitely worth it!!!"
4,Nice looking and simple,"The stroller is great if you just need something lightweight and simple and would really rate it somewhere between a 3-4. It's not for the parent who's going to be shopping often, since there isnt really any place to store or hang your shopping bags. But it's lightweight and a very good size for someone more petite (I'm 5'0), though my husband has no complaints about it (he's 6'3). The design of the stroller is nice. the colors are great and like I said, it's just a lightweight basic stroller. The only complaints I have are that there are no cup holders for you (but I've put my drink in the pocket, which seems to work fine) and it's not easily maneuvered with one hand. the last issue is the car seat base and car seat, they seem a little difficult to remove from one another, but not sure if that's the case with all car seats and bases."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!,I purchased this stroller 2 weeks ago for the breast cancer walk. I needed a stoller that was light and easy to get on a busy train in Philadelphia (not easy for a regular stroller). So after trying a lot of stoller and Babies r us we decided on this one. We didn't want to spend alot on a stroller but after trying it and seeing how it folds this was it. It is so convient to be able just to throw it right over your shoulder. I think my diaper bag is heavier then the stroller. I would recomended this stroller. I did the 3 mile walk and walked around Philly and my baby loved it. He also really likes the bar to put his feet on. My son is 4 months and weighs 16 punds and is 25 inches. He is not a small baby and fits in it great!! The orange color is also great!!
4,Good third stroller,"This is our third stroller. We have the Graco frame for the car seat and the big Jeep Stroller. We bought this one to put in the trunk of my husband's corolla as the jeep would not fit without taking off the wheels and we don't use the Graco car seat in his car.This is a nice little stroller. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is lightweight, portable and easy to set up and collapse. It is not the most sturdy of strollers and I don't recommend it for a walk around the neighorhood (that's what we use the Jeep for). But for trips to the mall or short trips anywhere else, you cannot beat it.It gets four stars instead of five because I do have longer legs and I do hit the wheels. My husband has no problem with it. The basket is quite small, you can't put hardly anything into it. You know what though? That's not why I bought it. You buy this type of stroller because of its size and weight. You want a big basket, buy a big stroller."
2,Interesting look at chakra based rituals,"More from the Queen of Skydancing. If you`ve read either of her 2 previous books, this one is rituals minus the sex. All rather obvious. A lot comes direct from Osho - there`s a surprise! If you`re interested in chakras and/or rituals this may be an interesting read, otherwise try something else."
5,Good Decorator Item for A Star Trek Fan,"I bought this sword about two years ago to hang on my wall. I was a bachelor and a Star Trek fan - need I say more? :) The handles are wrapped leather strips, and the blades appear to be made of a semi-thick stainless steel. Quality of the workmanship was very good. It arrived in a long box, with styrofoam packing material and plastic caps for the 4 sharp ends. The blade is not that sharp, but it is pointy and could easily cause some damage if it hit something/someone. And just because I could, I sharpened the ends of the sword and polished up the metal to a nice shine. Yet, in either condition is a deadly weapon you don't want your kids touching. It bends slightly under it's own weight (a few pounds), but not much considering it's overall size (4 feet long). I mounted it on the wall with some hooks - looks real good. Sure it's not an authentic signed-by-worf-himself replica, but it's a good prize for the budget fan (and a conversation point for non-fans)."
2,Disappointing Next Installment,"We read this in the bookstore before purchasing it and I'm glad that we did. Now, we LOVE Olivia. We think she's just the best, most self-assured little pig out there and we read her other two stories daily. This one, however, did not sit right with me as a parent. There is nothingg to learn from this book, nor is it any fun to read. It's just about a spoiled rotten self-centered little pig who doesn't have any manners. I absolutely love the illustrations; they are just as good as any of the other books, but the storyline really left a bad taste in my mouth. Olivia didn't even redeem herself at the end, or I probably would have purchased the book.Stick with the other two Olivia books and wait for the next one to come out, hopefully Ian Falconer will have given Olivia some manners and compassion back and it will be something fun and enjoyable to read."
4,FYI,I just read a Bio on Ian Falconer & he writes his books based on his sister's family. In real life Olivia is his niece and the boys are his nephews.My 2.5 year old adores Olivia & her grand imagination. She giggles everytime I read Olivia books to her. This piggy is great fun!
2,Obviously has potential.....must try harder,"After the first two books 'Olivia' and 'Olivia Saves the Circus' this story comes as a dissapointment. The wonderful art work and the wry humour are still there, but as others say the story is weak and disjointed.Don't be discouraged the first two are still superb."
5,The best Olivia book,"I have to say, I completely disagree with those who have said this is less good than the other Olivias, and/or just the story of a spoilt little pig/girl. For me, this is a far more complex story: it's all about the complexity of family, and the addition of ANOTHER COLOR is the best metaphor I've encountered for what happens to relationships when it's more than two people involved. Personally I feel that those who think the heart of the book is Olivia's lack of manners aremissing the point: so much attention is given to the mother's facial expressions, which show us all we need to know about what that mother thinks of the father's spoiling response to the loss of the toy. I should also say that my 2 yr old daughter really loves the book, for reasons that have nothing to do with being spoilt: she loves (as do I) the way that when Olivia asks her baby brother, Ian, ""WHERES MY TOY?"", Ian replies, ""Wooshie Gaga"". This moment of comic genius is alone worth the price of the book."
2,Disappointed,"""Olivia . . . and the Missing Toy"" is about Olivia trying to find her toy and eventually found that her dog destroyed it. She sewed it back up and finally forgave the dog.Positives:1. Olivia did forgive her dog so it does 'somewhat' teach forgiveness.Negatives:1. Olivia is a brat and demanding. While searching for her toy she does not say please or ask nicely for help & she falsely accuses her baby brother.2. It is very disjointed. The story begins with Olivia wanting a new soccer uniform that is a different color & the missing toy episode comes in about halfway through the story. The book does not return to or resolve the new soccer uniform part of the story.I would not recommend this book & will not be reading it to my child."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this book sight unseen(taught me a lesson)for my granddaughters birthday. After receiving it in the mail I decided I better read it before giving it to her and I am sure glad that I did. This book starts out with Olivia wanting a different color uniform than the rest of her soccer team and then in mid-stride the story switches to her missing a toy. Very fractured and no closure to the uniform problem. Needless to say i am returning the book without ever letting my granddaughter know of its existence.
4,Another winner,"Ian Falconer has done it again and made us all fall in love all over again with Olivia - almost in spite of ourselves. Olivia's strong personality, her even more strongly developed sense of individualism and epressiveness make her such an endearing character - especially for those of us with our own little Olivia's to contend with.The first Olivia book with a plot line, it is really well done, though less humerous than the never-to-be-outdone original. I really have fun reading this one to my daughters. Who went around the house saying ""wooshee-gaga"" for days!"
3,Must read it with a voice of sarcasm,"Childrens books are aplenty, so what would distinguish one from another. For some its the pictures, for others it is the stories, and yet others, it might be the humor. I would the Olivia books into the last category. The drawings are simple and the stories are quite easy to follow. So the best thing about them is the humor, both in the pictures and in the text. This short book is about Olivia tracking down her missing toy, which was taken by her pet dog. Of course there is a happy ending, but getting there is quite interesting as Olivia accuses her siblings, cat, and other inanimate objects of taking her toy. Personally, I think the book is best read out loud to kids with a sarcastic voice; it maximizes the humor."
2,Not good - plain and simple,"This book is all over the place and basically teaches children if they whine they will get whatever they want. (ie: Make me this shirt - and the mother does it immediately, my toy is broken - we'll buy you a new one, blah blah blah.) Olivia is a spoiled, pushy, liar.I started out liking the Olivia series and now they are just off the shelves in our household. The illustrations are beautiful and I like the style - just hate the stories and the messages they promote."
2,A Questionable Tale,"I'm a huge fan of Olivia and was thrilled to browse through this book and then pick up a copy for my nephew. It wasn't until I read it to my husband that I realized what a terrible story this is.This is a story about a selfish little girl who doesn't take the time to acknowledge her mother's handmade soccer shirt, yet proclaims her father to be the best person in the world when he gives her the promise of the purchase of the best toy ever.I love Olivia and parts of this book were so, well, Olivia! But I just don't feel the book presents the kind of message I would want my nephew...or my own children...to hear and think is okay.I returned the book very sad indeed."
3,A distant third to the previous books,"I am so glad to read that I am not the only one who has some discomfort with the theme of this book. That aside, I find this installment disjointed at best and I am very surprised that Falconer's copy editor did not assist more in making this a better read. My children do love the two pages where she is yelling at her little brothers, but beyond that, it's weak. I would say it's worth a trip to the library to read it once because I think the illustrations of this series are fabulous, but it certainly doesn't deserve a place in a permanent collection. Let's hope that Mr. Falconer frequents Amazon.com!"
1,Not as good as the first two,"Like the reviewer a few before me, I was quite disappointed with this book. So too was my five-year-old daughter, an Olivia fan, who has yet to request this book at bedtime since the first time we read it to her on Christmas Day night.With this book, Olivia turns from a precocious, engaging young pig to a self-absorbed brat. Most likely this will end up in our summer rummage sale."
5,OLIVIA still the perfect DIVA!,"Olivia has been a favorite character within my family and this latest title has been very well received!The best part of Olivia is her attitude and she is screaming DIVA in this one...she needs to stand out as an individual, she needs to have all her things around her and best of all she forgives and moves on in the end.The illustrations are beautifully done, the story is one every single child goes through at some point in their life and in the end Olivia...and the Missing Toy is a fantastic book for all ages."
3,Not as good as the first two :-(,"Like most Hollywood 3rd movies....'Olivia and the Missing Toy' doesn't quite measure up to the first two installments....the first one was so cute and clever....the second one was just as cute and surprisingly even more clever....but this third one comes across a bit contrived....the story is rather disjointed, jumping around from soccer attire to a missing toy....the one liners are nowhere near as humorous....and the ending is pretty much a letdown, lacking the climatic wit and irreverence of the first two....it's an OK book, but nothing like the first two Olivias....which is a bit of a disappointment considering how long we all had to wait for number 3?! :-("
5,cute book,The Olivia books always have cute pictures this one is no exception. I really enjoyed reading and sharing it with the children I babysit.
3,No Change Taking Place,"I enjoyed the first and second Olivia books, and there are large parts of this book that I enjoy, because Olivia is so . . . Olivia! At the same time, I see no growth, no change, so for me the series is becoming uninteresting. There's nothing about this book that makes it ""third"" in a series, except for the growing family. There's nothing about Olivia herself that has changed, and that's a disappointment."
5,Great tool for making pie crusts,"Recently I purchased a Harold Pie Crust Maker. It worked great. Before, I was rolling out my crust and then having to ""mold"" it to fit my pie pan. Using the Harold Pie Crust Maker all I have to do is put my dough in the bag and it comes out the perfect size."
5,Best Pie Invention!,"One summer I made 32 apricot pies and gave them away, but it left my kitchen a wreck--I got one of these for Christmas and can't live without it! So easy and helpful and I don't have to scrape flour and stuck-on dough off the countertop any more. I've used a few different crust recipes and it works every time--just flour the inside a bit, put in your ball of dough, flatten a bit and roll. For anyone complaining that these don't work, add a little more flour--it's never failed for me (sounds like you put too much liquid in your recipe). I LOVE IT!"
4,Pie crust maker,"haven't used it yet, but look forward to making the good 'ol home made ones. Looks like it should do the job!"
5,VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE PIE CRUST MAKER AND IT IS WONDERFULL I DID RECEIVE IT IN PERFECT CONDITION THIS PRODUCT IS VERY USEFUL TO MAKING PIES.AS IN THE PAST I HAVE ORDERED FORM AMAZON AND HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE ORDERED.THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU AND YOUR COMPANY.I AM ALWAYS VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS AND HOPE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO ALWAYS BE THAT WAY.SINCERLY,LIZ"
5,Perfect piecrust every time,This is the best new thing for perfect piecrusts. I have bought many and distributed them to my friends and children who make piecrusts. Couldn't do without it.
4,keeps counters clean,This is a good way to get that perfect size pie crust without handling the dough too much which will make pie crusts tough and the bonus part is that you don't have to get your counters or table all covered with flour.
4,Pleased with my purchase,"I am very glad to have purchased this item, but must confess I have nothad the chance to use it yet. Looking forward to using it though in thenear future!"
5,Great help for gluten free pie-crust,"Gluten free doughs are very sticky; although I anticipated some problems using this for GF dough, it wasn't as bad as I thought! I just added lots of GF flour & ground nuts & was able to ""roll out"" a decent GF pie crust. Pie turned out great, as the crust was much more even than usual. Had to add a bit of GF flour in between rolling out, to prevent sticking, but MUCH easier & better than trying to do without this crust maker.Also used the ""JAZ Innovations 10 Feet Beaded Pie Weight Chain"", which helped keep the crust from spreading & thickening.Clean up was easy ... just rinsed with hot water, laid on clean towel, wiped out with paper towel. Great kitchen helper! Highly recommended."
3,Pie Not Great For Oil Crusts,"I knew it was a gamble when I ordered this pie crust maker because I only make crusts using oil rather than a solid shortening. And sure enough, it was hard to release the dough from the plastic when using oil. I can see that it would probably work well with shortening crusts though."
1,Not Quite,"If you love dance music of the early n midd 90's be my guest n buy this. You must be a [...] fool to buy this if you play in a party u'll be laughed@ for days. All the songs are old when they came out they where tight but 6-10 years later not quite. Trance music is taking over the dance sercit. Only song that is good on this More&More from Captain Hollywood. Get a cd like America Trance Nation Vol2 or Estial Trance Collection (6cdset). Im saying if you wan't to bump old school dance be my guest n buy it if you r in 2 like Present dance don't buy. I bet some that gave this a 3 star all the way up to a way 5 stat never heard thease songs and are thriled about this cd but ppl if you great dance music do not buy this cd it's a waste of your money,."
5,Awesome!,"Everything about this purchase was great...I already had this CD but some where along the line it went missing...this is a great motivator to get up and move your body.I would definitely repeat this purchase, great price, speedy delivery and delivered exactly the way it was decribed."
1,Crude Finish w/ Vibration,"The first thing you notice about this fan is it's low quality. It has a rough finish, not smooth to the touch like a baked on paint job. The blade is not balanced so it produces a lot of noise and vibration when running. It buzzes against floor producing secondary oscillations. Avoid"
3,"Best fan ever, for 1 year, then DEAD, and seller has not replied.","I got this fan because the gym I lift at has one. It's run 18 hours a day everyday and always blasted out a heavy wind. So I bought the same one. Worked great for 1 year and then just stopped, can't get it to turn at all. Makes no noise, nothing. I wrote the Seller and got no response. Tried calling, they never returned the call. So I contacted the company Patton, since the papers say it's a 5 year warranty, their people told me it's 10 years, but they quit making it so they have no replacement for me. They suggested I check back with them in a few months. That started last winter, when I didn't need a fan. Now it's summer in the tropics, they said check back next month....It was a great fan, but now I'm the one that's getting spun around in the heat."
2,Pinwheels Spinning,"I have four pinwheels. Only two of them spin freely in the wind. The manufacturer recommends that if you have pinwheels that don't turn, you should gently reshape their blades. I've done this without success. I love stainless steel, so I am disappointed in the pinwheel's performance. I am sure the pinwheel could have been engineered to spin better."
2,"Great Design, Won't Spin","Really good design, but as received the blades hit the shaft, keeping it from spinning. I'll try something to space it further out."
4,Blomus Pinwheel,"This item was purchased as a gift for a friend. She loved the appearance of the pinwheel and mentioned how well it had been packed for shipping. She also said that it seems very sturdy as it takes a good gust of wind to set it spinning. The only problem reported was that the pinwheel would not spin initially because it was coming into contact with the pole. This was quickly remedied by using two nuts as additional spacers. My friend said that she felt either a piece was missing or it was simply a problem of poor design. Overall it was a great purchase, but I am slightly disappointed that it required some fixing for it to work properly."
5,Spinning fun,yesterday was windy and my pinwheel got to show off. I put it in a large barrel with a HUGE Begonia~~~looks great. A bit of whimsey that I enjoyed watching while working in yard. The product is very nicely made & lots of fun !
3,works all right,"It covers a great portion of the high chairs; however I cannot keep it secure. As soon as my son moves around, the cover moves with him and exposes different parts of the high chair. I will work with it more to try to make it more secure because I may not have adjusted to the velcro tight enough. Otherwise, it serves its purpose, I just wish it stayed in place better."
2,"Cute, but not really worth using","This was a flimsy fabric with velcro that didn't fit all high chairs that well. Once it was placed on the high chair, getting the child to put his legs through the openings caused the whole thing to come off. It was more frustrating to use than it's worth."
1,Totally Fell Apart after Gentle/Cold Cycle Wash,"I have the Clean Diner in the green dot color. I washed it once on gentle/cold cycle when it arrived in the mail, and once more after it had become dirty from food. Now, the velcro strips have totally come detached from the fabric and there are long, loose threads from the fabric hanging from all over (all over!) the product. It looks awful and it barely serves it purpose now that it won't stay put in a high chair without the velcro system that secures the fabric around the chair.I also went online to return the product to the Clean Shopper company, but I'm pretty sure that the company no longer exists. When I visited its website, I was taken to a blank page that read, without more, ""We thank you for your business over the years and wish you all the best."" I'm thinking that my Clean Diner must have come from one of the last, very poorly made product lots before the company went under."
3,velcro deficient,Very disappointed in the velcro sewn in this cover. The 2 pieces were narrow and sewn crosswise to each other providing the least amount of hold. I had to purchase wide velcro and sew into the cover to keep it in place when the children were in their chairs. Otherwise the quality of fabric was fine.
1,TERRIBLE Highchair Cover,"This is the second highchair cover I bought and I am now searching for my third! The first one I bought was an Eddie Bauer version. It was much better than this and half the price. I have yet to find a wooden chair that this fits into properly. It is nearly impossible to attach to the highchair and never stays in place. The velcro is in odd spots and doesn't stay secured. The belt needs to go around the chair from beneath and doesn't hold the child in place. Not only that, you have to get on the ground and crouch down on the floor trying to wrestle the belt into the loop of fabric...it's a nightmare! I hate it! Buyer beware--this product is garbage!"
4,Liked most of it,"Please note that this album isn't exclusively Ragtime - it also contains some stride/jazz pieces.If Ragtime is what you are after, check out Richard Dowling's other album,World's Greatest Piano Rags. It's excellent.When Dowling sticks to the original compostion, the results are very pleasing. He does at times take a different tact to playing certain phrases - occasionally swapping legato for staccato (and vice-versa), and this gives him a kind-of signature sound (he doesn't do this excessively).It's when he takes more of an artistic license with embelishments that I'm tempted to hit the fast forward button. For example, his excursions on ""The Entertainer"" seem rather dubious to me.For the most part though, this album is quite listenable (especially liked ""Handful of Keys"" and ""Magnetic Rag"")."
5,Easy Reading for a book so full of good information,"I thought this book was written very well. I love the way the author starts each chapter with a story from a character's point of view telling a story with the subject matter of that particular chapter. It was very easy reading and it was very hard to put down. There was a lot of really good historical information put together very nicely. I give this book definete thumbs up for everyone, even laymen readers as myself!"
5,Fantastic set,This was a gift for my husband and he hasn't yet viewed it all. It arrived in great time and the packaging looks fantastic. I know he'll treasure it for a very long time.
4,more than just trains,this is a very nice collection of vintage footage of steam trains and also other aspects of the steam train era.
2,Really old footage,"This DVD is of really old footage. If that's what you are looking for you will likely enjoy this. I bought this for my 4 year old who is a train fanatic. It was not enjoyable, kind of hard to hear, and not at all what I thought it would be. I bought mine at target for $7.99 & seriously regret the purchase."
3,"Nice gimmick, ABKCO","Twenty-five songs on 11 disks? No thanks. The packaging is great I'm sure, giving each cd a jacket identical to the one used on the 45s back in the 1960s. Just give me the music, please.If you want these songs, you'll find ALL of them on SINGLES: THE LONDON YEARS, a collection that only has three cds. Yes, that's right, you can listen to a cd for at least thirty minutes without having to change it. Now, isn't that smart?"
4,Small Toys/ Big Adventures,"The Star Wars Galactic Heroes are the more kid version of the 3 3/4 hasbro toys, they are very well built and will last a long time, the paint wears down, but no more than any regular action figure. for kids it's better to play out adventures compared to the 3 3/4 figures because they are easier to hold, only the right hand of the jedi or sith moves but you can just let your imagination do the rest"
1,Clases de canto.,"A la verdad es que este cd necesita un arreglo de primera, Bonny Cepeda este cd twe busca a gritos."
3,Great Lighting,The outdoor lamps have great lighting and easy to install. My only problem is that the motion sensors are turned all the way down and the lights go on frequently during the night. I will purchase Heath Zenith lamps in the spring.
1,Don't waste your money on this light!,"The motion sensor is way too sensitive & the light will constantly turn off and on. I followed the troubleshooting steps enough times to no avail that I had to write a review on this junk. I will never, ever buy another Cooper product!"
5,very good story adds different things in as you go.,"This is a very good story. I just wish Keene would follow up on people in the stories in later books. Like Mick, you never get to see him again thus far in the series."
4,It was.......GOOD........,I thought the book was very good but it made me mad how Nancy likes Mick rather then Frank. Frank didn't even seem BOTHERED by the looks Nancy and Mick gave each other. The mystery was a cool one but it wasn't exciting and it was kinda slow.It was a good book but not the best.
3,Felt a half size larger than marked,"The heels are really high, but comfortable and easy to walk in and really cute. The only problem with this is that it felt at least a half size larger than marked. I got size 7 and now I want to exchange it for 6.5, but it seems like that 6.5 have been sold out. I guess I am just going to keep it and give it away to my friend.... not very happy about that."
4,awesome Printer!!,This cartridge works awesome in the BJC-3000. It scans beatifully and helps save space!
4,Everything you wanted to know about ERP but...,"A great summary on the conventional wisdom about the equity risk premium. It covers -and combine- theory and evidence in a very reasonable balance. A couple of warnings. First, it puts the same emphasis on several alternative explanations, not always comparing and weighting them. Second, the book has some typos being probably the most important that of page 103 (equation 3.2). Nevertheless, a must have for every finance practitioner."
2,Not good sound,"I bought this product to fit in my 97 nissan maxima.This product doesn't fit in 5.25 inch mount.Sound is okay if you don't like to jam it, I don't like jam in my old car, so I bought this item.Ugly looking with yellow cone.As product description, mine didn't come with cable, so I have to buy from other place.Not this product if you want to listen good sound, but for that much of price you can't beat it."
2,not what you expect,"I bought this book hoping it would give a good outline to what would be on the cissp exam. It really isnt. The authors collected a bunch of articles they didnt write, and threw them into the 10 CBK categories. The articles themselves are interesting and good, but it wont really prep you for the exam. It is obvious that they wanted to take advantage of persons wishing to pass the CISSP, and threw together a bunch of [junk]. Im sure you could find every article in this book on the internet somewhere. I would recommed getting the free open study guides at cccure.org instead of this. Dont listen to the other reviewers, they are obviously authors or authors friends."
3,Passing the CISSP Exam,"I have read this book, and while it is no doubt a good book, it is VERY dry and boring. I feel somewhat confident after reading this, but I will be buying the practice exam for this exam from boson.com before I step foot into that exam room (as well as some late night cramming). This book does seem to cover the various domains despite you will constantly have to pinch yourself while reading ;-)"
1,This book was useless for the CISSP,"This book was useless for the CISSP Exam. Half of the chapters aren't even covered on the exam, and the remainder doesn't prepare you for the content covered in the exam. Spend your hard earned money on the CISSP Prep Guide instead. If you don't believe me, compare the reviews. Also checkout the SRVBooks as well. Both of these books helped me to prepare for the exam. The Boson tests were only so-so. And yes, I passed my CISSP exam on the first try."
5,"Best of the ""first-time"" triathlon how-to books","I bought two books that were aimed at first-time Triathlon entrants, and while this book might have fewer diagrams or photos, it is by far the better of the two books. I would categorize this as more of a ""how-to"" book than a diary, and while you might want to read some other biographical accounts of first-timers, make sure you read this so you know what you should be doing to get ready! The author writes in very clear and precise language, and you feel that you are very well prepared to train using his advice. I particularly enjoyed the nutrition information which was much clearer than in the ""other"" book."
2,Good for motivation....that's all,"This book is great to help you get motivated and mostly teaches you that attitude is key to success. It will not teach swim, run or bike techniques, so don't waste the money if, like me, you are looking for actual instructions. Basically, the swim section tells you that you shouldn't learn alone, to go find an instructor. Thanks...I sure wouldn't have thought of the obvious without paying $20 for Joe to tell me! Hopefully his other books are better, but I sure won't pay to find out."
2,Outdated,"In the six years since this book came out (copyright 2005) significant progress has been made in both triathlon technology and physiological research on athletes. Worthwhile if you just need the basics, but compared to my other beginner tri books, this one just doesn't provide the same level of detail. Also disappointing, the author's website referenced often in the book appears to no longer be online.In the early chapters, Friel recommends that your first triathlon goal be ""to make it across the finish line with a smile on you face"". Later chapters discuss optional workouts that you can skip but warns 'you will finish the race but you might not meet your triathlon goal'. So, I'll finish the race without the extra workouts but I just won't be smiling at the time? Admittedly, I skipped around but this seems to conflict with what the author originally recommends.Good book, but needs a new version."
2,Not so helpful,"The majority the the information in this book was very basic and common sense. I bought it while training for my my first triathlon but did not find it helpful. I attended a clinic put on by my local triathlon club and found that one hour investment worth more then this book. It could be cut down to three short chapters and still cover the basics(equipment considerations, training, and race day details."
5,Perfect for the Newbi,"This is the best introduction to triathlon book I have found. It loads you up with all the important information to get ready to complete you first triathlon without bogging down too deep into the technical stuff. The training plan is exactly what I was after and the book is extremely well written. Written for people with no fitness, or for people who may be strong in just one of the triathlon legs."
3,OK - not great,"This book has useful advice - also includes some training tips. It provides more of an overview rather than in-depth instruction on how to do things. Overall, the book is OK but not great."
4,Good for someone training for their 1st time,"I was a little hesitant to buy this book after reading some of the reviews saying it was ""too basic."" I found it very helpful, esp the nutritional info. The training plan seems a little unrealistic -- its a 12 week plan that starts out with only 15 minute workouts. All in all, the book included a lot of valuable information that has helped me progress in my training for my first tri, but I wouldn't follow it word for word."
3,Your First Triathlon,"I guess if you had no access to the internet or a library this book would be good for you. You won't learn any eye-opening tips or tricks from it, and the training plan is geared toward someone who is basically a couch potato attempting a sprint tri. If that's you, go for it, otherwise, save your money and just google 'beginner triathlete' for plenty of websites and forums that offer the same information."
4,Good intro to triathlons,"This book offers a good inital overview for those just starting in triathlons. Might be a bit basic for those who are already accomplished in the swimming, biking, and running. Liked the chapter that outlined what to expect in your first race - good pointers."
2,"I know it's for beginners, but really.",The info was way too basic. Hardly anything on swim stroke. Find something else unless you don't even know what a tri is.
5,Your First Triathlon,"If you are thinking in running your first triathlon and know almost nothing about this topic, this is the book for you. Very detailed and encouraging! Go for it!"
2,Fairly good business title.,"This is a so-so book about the life of one businessman. It kept me interested but it was no ""Father, Son & Company"". It was great how it followed through from the funeral home days up to the biggest events in Mr Ross' life."
1,Production or copy quality poor.,"Either this was a bootleg copy or real poor production of series, but the sound quality was horrible."
2,Mildly interesting...,"...very mildly. Not enough info and what there is most film fans already know. Pass on this one, I wish that I had."
5,"A great idea...and a fun, informative read","The authors seem to have had a very rough job while researching this book--it consists of nothing but big, big Hollywood bombs. I never thought it would be this fun reading about Battlefield Earth, Surviving Christmas, Mary Reilly and other tanks by Hollywood's biggest stars. Lots of interesting information. It's a page-turner."
5,"Delightful, captured personalities, lighthearted seriousness","I really did not want to like this book at first due to tired cliches about an ordinary educated woman living an ordinary life, including all her dysfunction. How wrong I was as I pushed through the first few chapters. The author has done a superb, delightful job of capturing the idiosyncrasies that make one an individual and the subtlety of maturation. Additionally, little gems here and there made the book a completely wonderful read."
4,An expose and exploration of 2nd-rate artists in 4 tales,"This short collection of four short stories is connected by a theme of human littleness, provincialness, and self-deception. Music, art, and Italy are perhaps more basic links between the tales. Each of the stories features flawed human beings. The stories explore the relationships between people, exposing self-centered fantasies and delusions while at the same time showing the beauty of the human capacity to idealize and dream. The human pursuit of celebrity and celebrity-worship and the distance between celebrity and artistry are other themes that occur throughout the volume as well. Keates has mastered both the first-person and third-person narrative style. The stories also feature several homosexual characters and explores the problems of love both heterosexual and homosexual."
3,Good for quickie not for the veteran,"Steven Woodworth's tour book is excellent for the novice who wants more than the average tour of the battlefield. This is apparently his goal for the book. Other than some out of chronological order stops, I found the tour easy to follow and the maps easy to use. The information most useful from this book is the section on the battles of Chattanooga. I have not found a better quick tour of Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain anywhere. What I didn't like about the book was the fact that it extensively sampled from material already available elsewhere and provided no new information on places to visit at Chickamauga. If you want the best tour, get the US Army War College Guide to Chickamauga and correlate the stops from it while using Woodworths maps. In summary, if you are a novice to the Civil War Battlefield or have never been to ChickChatt National Park this book is for you. If you are a veteran of the Civil War Battlefield it's not."
1,Not Good,Don't get this book. The earlier reviewer was correct. I found a free guide on the internet that had better maps and was more in depth. This book is interesting but I kept having to turn from the tour to the back to follow the optional stops which was annoying. I had also read several books about the battle before I went on my tour and noticed that the author had taken his interesting stories right out of these books which I didn't like. I also recommend the War College Guide and the new book by the same author that has a guide to the Battle of Chattanooga (Storming the Heights).
3,Good not Great.,"As is typical of Dr. Woodworth's books, he has once again rehashed old material into something new. The maps are excellent but the paths this book leads the reader down are too well worn to truly be interesting. Also, the way the book is laid out with regard to touring the Chickamauga Battlefield is cumbersome. The reader has to move from the front of the book to the back in an awkward way to visit the optional excursions. These should have been left in order and the reader simply allowed to skip them at their discretion. I agree with the other reviewer that the War College Guide is better if the reader has any Civil War touring experience. In comparison to the other guide books available, this one definitely rates as mediocre. A quick search of the internet before a visit to the park will net the reader a much better guide and probably one for free!"
5,This book is great...,"I would challenge the last reviewer to name some of his evidence that can't be refuted... He is ignorant, and this book is extremely well documented,and all sources are listed. He also admits that some sources aren't accepted because of their disaccordance with evolution; but isn't that the whole point of the book? Please keep your mouth shut if you haven't done any research on the other side of things."
1,engaño,este producto lo compro pero cuando lo coloco no es la medida y mi aro es numero 11 pulgada osea ese pro ducto vino mas grande quiero que me devuelvan mi dinero urg es un engaño
4,Righ Tool For The Job,This tool makes downspout work much much easier and faster than trying to use plyers.There are no instructions and it's not obvious where to make the crimp or how to position the tool.I found that using it on the 4 corners of the downspout and with the side with the larger number of blades facing outward worked best.
4,a good book for young actors,"I first picked up this book at camp. I was looking for something to preform in the talent show that could doble as an audition peice. As young looking 15 yearold I offten find it very hard to find monolouges that fit my age group. After years of looking I found it. My dream monolouge. It was in this book. While yes, this book does have some monolouges for older children it also has some mature youger ones aswell. (Nothing below the age of a mature 12 year old) However, most of the monolouges have a seious side to them. They are not to be taken as funny monolouges that will amuse people but a serious peices taken from serious plays. If you are looking for a monolouge that will chalenge you this book is for you. if not then look elsewhare."
2,Um... i think i'll return this one,i bought this book with little experience with monolouges but after buying a few other books this one doesnt even help me. the monologues cant be acted truly because you really dont know what they mean. they're not significant and i wouldn't use any of them for an audition.
2,It is ok,I borrowed this book from a friend it was OK but it didn't have a lot of monologues that a 15-year old could use.
3,an ok source for monologes,I feel that this book is and inadequate source for monologes because it doesnt have enough monologes. I feel that it could have been better if it was more pages. I also feel that the authors could have expanded their types of monologes better.
5,A candid glimpse into musical history,"I had downloaded a few tracks from iTunes and decided that I wanted more. I wasn't disappointed. This is a treasure trove of first-hand accounts from a great and famous musician of what his life was like. The style and tone of Jelly's speech as much as the stories he told really helped paint a picture of being a musician and just being around in the early 1900s. I wish there were more recorded accounts like this--it's sort of like spending a weekend with my grandpa listening to what it was like for him as a youth. There's a lot of great music here too, and language that will offend many, but it's a rough-and-tumble account of rough-and -tumble times. I couldn't recommend these CDs highly enough to anyone interested in the formative years of jazz, when ragtime was still hot, and New Orleans was an incubator for music that eventually swept the nation. I've listened to the entire set several times, and still listen to parts of it every week."
2,Very Low Bit Rates - Buyer Beware!,"This is not a review of the quality of the LOC Recordings - they are indespensible. This review is meant for those who are thinking of saving time and money by purchasing the set as MP3s.Amazon states that they use variable bit rates for encoding, ""aiming at an average of 256 kilobits per second (kbps)"". The average bit rate for this entire set is 150 kilobits per second, with a low of 122, and a high of 211. In fact, the 211 kbps occurred on the last track of the set, and was the only one above 173 kbps.Bottom Line: if you are using high quality headphones, you will notice the difference in sound quality. I love Amazon, but I would not have bought the set if I had known that the quality was this low. Buy at your own risk."
2,poor substitute for original PATTON high velocity,"Back in the mid 1980's I bought a Patton 14 inch high velocity fan; although this fan i am reviewing uses the same name, it is not at all nearly as good as the original. The original actuallyhad three different speeds ;while this one uses three speeds, they are hardly distinquishable from each other; the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version. The original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version. Oh, yes the original's lowest speed was actually quiet whereas none of the speeds on this new version is quiet. Bad substitute and mediocre fan."
4,Something New,"I liked this book because it describes many REAL projects that are underway. It does not discuss only the technology behind the projects, it also relates specific technology to those projects. Also the book has a whole chapter devoted to International advanced Internet projects. This is a very important and interesting topc, which I have not seen in other books."
2,Can't consider Gregory hero material...,"I loved most of the Bridgerton series. This one is the one that I can do without. This book does not portray Gregory well in the role of hero. I couldn't get into it. There are moments of classic Quinn humor. However, I was able to put down the book for days before I finally forced myself to finish it up."
2,Greatly Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this installment. I usually love Julia Quinn, her books are normally funny and romantic. However, the characters and how they related to each other seemed immature (more of a highschool boyfriend/girlfriend romance than a romance between adults). In the end, the heroine came across as cowardly, the book had unnecessary plot twist and the author did not know when to end the book. Very disappointed. I think the author should rewrite and then rerelease the book."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"As an avid historical romance reader and a huge Julia Quinn fan, I was so disappointed by this book. I've waited for it to come out for months and bought it the day it was released! I agree with the other reviewer who said the cliffhanger in the prologue drew me in, but after the plot dragged on and on. There was too much meaningless dialogue, and ultimately I did not fall in love with the characters. Although I finished the book, I could have easily stopped reading midway through. If you have not read When He Was Wicked by Julia Quinn, read it instead."
2,"I love you Julia, but...","... this was really disappointing. I have ADORED the previous books in the Bridgerton series, and I can always count on Julia Quinn for interesting plots and characters who make me want to keep reading forever. But this book seemed like a rough draft more than anything else. The dialogue was choppy and flippant. The characters seemed to be too immature to be interesting. And I was peeved by the fact that a major (and interesting!) twist in the plot was reserved for the very end of the book, when it should have been introduced in the beginning to give this book the ""oomph"" that it was sorely lacking. I still think Julia Quinn is one of the all-time greatest romance novelists, but this is the one book that didn't hit the mark."
2,Disappointed,"Too much silly chatter, not enough heat or sizzle. Of all the Bridgertons, it was the worst... looking forward to a fresh start from Julia Quinn."
2,A major disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed in this offering as I am a huge fan of Ms.Quinn. I love the Bridgerton clan and actually enjoyed the first half of the book, but the plot took a bizarre turn at the wedding that left Gregory looking pathetic and desparate. Why would anyone do that to your hero?? This may be the worst ending to a novel I have ever read. Truly Bizzare."
2,What happened to the fun Bridgerton boys?,"I have to say that this is probably my least favorite Bridgerton books. It lacked what all her other books had. He was not as witty and charming as his other brothers............i did not want to finish this book, i just did because i knew that this will be the last with this family."
5,On The Way to the Wedding (Bridgerton Family) by Julia Quinn,"I chose his rating because like all her other books I have read,I really enjoyed them . They make you laugh and they make you cry . You feel as though you are a part of the Family . YOU feel all the joy and the emotions they feel.when I read Julia Quinn book's I feel as though I am a part of the book !"
3,Did I read the same book?,I love Julia Quinn and looked forward to reading Gregory's story but what has happened to her writing style. It. Has. Been. Made. Into. A. Mess. So many short sentences and SO much repetition that I actually flipped pages .. on Julia! I suspect that the plot was a problem in that the two protoganists were apart from much of the time and the story only picked up at the end. But. It. Must. Not. Happen. Again. Julia.
2,What Happened to Julia Quinn,"Julia Quinn used to be a fresh writer whose stories were at turns witty and interesting. They held your attention with strong and quirky characters. I found myself wondering what went wrong with her last couple of books, including this one. This book is certainly a lackluster effort when compared to the Duke and I or earlier works."
3,Nothing too great,"I read this over a rainy weekend. I'm glad we have run out of Bridgertons at last. This is an example of what happens when you have too many characters and a formula to fill in. Dull!!! Very dull writing!!! How many times can a character frown, purse his/her lips, cross his arms across his broad chest, or place her hands on her hips? How may times can you write little asides and comments and not drive the reader crazy? I grew weary reading it. The story left no impression on me. I can't even remember how the plot resolved now, and it's only been a few weeks since I read it! Something happened, and they got married and had too may kids. That's all I remember. Blah."
4,Very entertaining read,"Another wonderful Julia Quinn read. The heroine in this story, Lucy, was quirky and fun. She reminded me of Kate from ""The Viscount Who Loved Me"". Our hero, Gregory, has turned into a wonderful man, who is not afraid to let his feelings show.While the interaction with the Bridgertons wasn't as strong as in past books, it was still very enjoyable. It was definitely worth the two afternoons I spent reading it.Other books I enjoyed- Julia Quinn: The Viscount Who Loved Me, The Duke and I - Lisa Kleypas: It Happened One Autumn, Dreaming of You - Eloisa James: Much Ado About You, Duchess in Love - Judith McNaught: Something Wonderful, Almost Heaven"
2,This one is pretty bad,Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Ms. Quinn. It's either a hit or miss with her but most of her books do entertain. This one is definately a miss. I found myself so bored with the characters and the plot. The book drags on for the first 200 pages and then all of a sudden during the last 50 pages of the book the characters fall madly in love with each other and a blackmail plot pops up. Pretty sad ending for such a great series.
2,On The Way to the Wedding,"By the time I got to this book, I must admit I was tired of reading about the Bridgertons. This book did not hold my interest, with each character flitting from love interest to love interest. However, the epilogue was a very cute way to end the book. I really liked the ending."
1,I want my money back,"I did something i have never done in my life, returned a book to the store. i was so disappointed with this book and felt that i wasted my time, i was furious. and yes i did finish the whole book. i found this novel to be sooooooo annoying, uninteresting and boaring. the main characters were a joke, the plot was uninspiring. there was nothing in this story to suatain me."
2,Disappointing final Bridgerton,This was really disappointing. I have enjoyed the previous books in the Bridgerton series and was really looking forward to a strong finish to the Bridgerton series. The plot had a good intention but the delivery of it was rather poor. This is not a keeper.
2,Did I finish reading it?,"I'm not being sarcastic, I really can't remember. I read up to the wedding, I think, then put it aside for awhile. And I thought I finished it, but I can't really remember if I did.I loved the Bridgerton series, but I didn't really care for this book. I have to say none of the characters were all that interesting. I stopped liking the heroine when she went through with the marriage. The hero was kind of an airhead. First he loves Hermoine because he saw the back of her neck, then he feels the same way when he sees the back of Lucy's neck.I guess the whole subplot about Lucy being forced to marry was to try and redeem Gregory from being such a bubble-headed boobie, but it just made Lucy unlikeable."
2,"2.5 Stars, Boring Story & Characters",I found this book to be quite boring. There was not enough substance to the story and lacked humor that is usually present in Quinn's books. The characters were whiney. I didn't like this book at all.
2,VERY FRUSTRATING,I'M NOT SURE IF THE PROLOGUE SET THE TONE OR IF IT WAS JUST THE ENTIRE BOOK THAT FRUSTRATED ME. THE CHARACTERS WERE BELIEVABLE BUT THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH DRAMA FOR MY TASTE. DEFINATELY NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES.
4,"Fast reading, felt something was missing","I enjoyed reading the book, but felt that something was missing from it compared to Julia Quinn's other books. This is the finale of the bridgerton series, and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I was a little disappointed.What I don't find interesting is how Gregory could fall in love with both women really fast, and have him fall out of love with hermoine. I could understand maybe physical attraction due to how beautiful she is, which was what it was when Gregory saw her, but when he got to know her, there wasn't an attraction. So technically he wasn't in love with her.I think it would have been better if gregory was clueless over what falling in love means and should have had a meeting with the husbands of the bridgerton family and talk over it, that would have been a good ending to the series."
4,fun fun fun,I picked this book up from the grocery store and was pleasantly surprised. I admit I have not read other books in this series. But I found this great as a stand alone book. The dialog was smart and funny. The characters were believable. I especially enjoyed that the man was the romantic in this book. The he loves her and she loves someone else start was novel. I laughed out loud while reading this--always a great thing.
4,Awesome!!,"This book is a great ending the Bridgerton series. I have been looking forward to Gregory's story for a while because he has always been my favorite Bridgerton character (I don't really know why :/). Julia Quinn is my favorite author and this book was an absolute delight to read. I was done with it in a day and actually plan on reading it again along with the other books in the series. The reason I gave it four stars and not five, however, is because it had more ""mystery"" in it then I would like to have in a romance novel. To me, Julia Quinn is more light and fluffy and when she added that extra bit about treason it just didn't really didn't do it for me. But, altogether it was a great read and Julia Quinn gets an A from me."
3,Mediocre for Quinn,"While this wasn't the worst of the Brigertons, it wasn't the best either. The first 4 books in this series were SO funny and interesting and clever, but this finale doesn't quite live up to that early standard. It's not as bad as the Eloise story, but it's more like the most recent Hyacinth story - kind of blah. I didn't care as much about Gregory and Lucy triumping at the end. Lucy is a second-rate Kate, and I wanted to see more evidence of a ""sharp wit"" (claimed on the back cover). Also, you didn't really see Gregory struggle that much - he takes a huge leap of faith, but it doesn't really make him hesitate that much (even when asked to take a second leap). It's probably good that the family is out of children - hopefully the new book will bring the really clever characters and dialogue that made me love Julia Quinn in the first place."
3,Definitely 3 stars,"If you read the ""3"" star reviews, they express my feelings about this book. It is very much a ""3"" star book. The book does suddenly seem to turn into a different type of story somewhere around the middle. I, too, lost patience with the heroine who seemed to lose her intelligence as the story progressed. Finally, I also thought the hero was little too young for my tastes. I have thoroughly enjoyed this series, though, and I would recommend reading this story if you've read the others. I was just a tad bit disappointed--it wasn't a terrible book, but it wasn't a great book either."
2,Disappointed..se,"I couldn't help but be disappointed by this book, especially when I was so looking forward to if only because it was from the bridgerton series.Unfortunately it doesn't follow through like the previous books in the series.Gregory is weak...it almost seemed like he was in love with being in love than the heroine. And the less we talk about the heroine, the better. To say she was weak is putting it mildly. Well I am all for things and situations working out till I reveal my innermost feelings, but Lucy just about gives a new meaning to it. A little spine would have just worked wonders for her character. But alas!!Furthermore, it seemed like the story didnt really have much to it. Something seemed to be missing from it. All in all..it was a waste of time and it hardly the word that I would have ever thought to apply to a ""Julia Quinn""."
2,Skip,"This story was a disappointing ending to the Bridgerton books. I really didn't care for how Gregory was portrayed - he was super lame and seemed to only have one sentiment for Lucy which was ""I love you"". Not very creative. And the so-called suspenseful last 3rd of the book was predictable. Not a good way to end the series, but at least many of the others can stand alone."
4,great but..,"Love the stroller. It is lightweight and easy to use. The problem is with the car seat! Attaching the car seat to the stroller is impossible!! And it takes forever!!! It does not easily hook in and when you are by yourself with a baby and need to go somewhere fighting with a car seat and stroller is the last thing you want to do!If you are just buying to use the stroller...go for it! But if you want to use your stroller with the car seat, this is not the stroller for you!"
5,We Love It!,"Even though we still have a few months before it will be used, I already love my Pliko P3. After doing a lot of comparison shopping and looking at the Graco, we decided to get something that is light and easy to use is well worth it. We also purchased the Primo Viaggio SIP infant seat, which is also well worth the money-since talking with a coworker, his son would still fit in the Peg infant seat and not in the Graco. People have said it is hard to latch the car seat on may not have the latches in the proper position, because it is very easy after the first time. I am hoping our little guy will like it as much as we do!"
1,Overpriced - NOT user friendly,"This stroller was the biggest waste of money. Crappy cup holder, no wear to put your keys. The basket has no access and is not even big enough for a diaper bag. It is not a one hand folding stroller, it takes 3! The positives... It looks good and thats about it. I had to get over that and think more practical. I bought Graco instead. It's not nearly as actractive but I would much rather have something functunal."
5,Great visual compilation of Graves' recent projects,"I got this book as a father's day present and I absolutely love it. It has great photography of each of the finished projects, gives a brief description of the project and interesting facts about each. There are also photos of some of Graves' 3-d models for some concept buildings that never ""made it to production"", as well as a peppering of his wonderfully whimsical sketches. A must have for anyone interested in architecture or design, or anyone that has even a remote fascination into the beauty that is a Graves' design."
4,Bowie is back,"while some may say that bowie is just doing what was popular at the time(techno/dance music)i feel that they are completly wrong.bowie does what he wants when he wants and then drops it and moves on to something new.this album has bowie moving on to a different sound than bowie fans are used to(i feel he got the idea to do this by hanging around with trent reznor).while the songs are a little too long(little wonder can get boring after a while and so can some of the others)bowie still keeps you interested in the music in some way.i'm afraid of americans is possibly one of bowie's biggest rock songs,and sounds more like tin machine(the original is on the showgirls soundtrack and the album version is way better than the nine inch nails mix wich sucks)bowie always seems to wrap in new styles of music and different kinds of people with every album.and he did it again with this one.it's no hunky dory(his best)but it's still bowie,and it still rocks."
4,electronic juice for the soul.,"this bowie album is by far one of my favorites by him, either you love it, or you hate it. each track uses the drum and bass format and elevates it to a whole new level. bowie takes elements of the electronica he helped invent and adds analog sounds over top: loud guitars, keyboards by brian eno, crazy piano solos (looking for a satellite), etc, with catchy bowie lyrics and melodies making it quite a journey. ""i'm afraid of americans"" is the standout, blending paranoia with the downright weird (nine inch nails version highly recommended). ""7 years in tibet"" is also a great song, with an explosive chorus that can only be done by the best. the rest of the album is great, instant bowie classics. why this thing is out of print i have no idea, it's a genius of melody and sound at his best. whenever i need a break from the eddie vedder sound-alikes and mediocre crap on the radio, earthlings is the first place i turn."
3,"Good stuff, but not for Bowie","Don't get me wrong, as this album is a favorite for many Bowie fans. I like it too, but not nearly as much as some of his other work. This album just doesn't sound like he put to much into it. Of course, I totally understand why. Bowie was trying to appeal to a younger audience, and he made some really cool music videos with these songs in the process. The album Outside had a similar style (not identical, but similar) with a much better outcome, if you ask me.Still, if nothing else, it's neat just to prove that Bowie can do anything he wants, this was one style of music he hadn't touched, and he did, fairly successfully. He doesn't work his vocals too hard on this album though, and it would be neat to see him tackle this style again, but working a little harder.His next album, Hours, heads in a totally different direction, and I think he did a better job with that."
3,There is SOME great music on here.,"David Bowie has captured the souls of many with his special talent for music. He has, however, been able to do this for many years without the help of the ""techno"" scene. But even in techno music, Bowie has talent. This is a great album and the songwriting is extraordinary. Songs like ""Seven Years in Tibet"" and ""Looking For Satellites"" really show that Bowie has talent in any genre of music, and is capable to performing up to standards way beyond the age of 50."
3,Bowie takes on 'techno' with mixed results....,"Bowie garnered some of his best reviews in years with this album, and its a lot better than the concept of 'Bowie' and 'Electronica' sounds. Whats definetly good about it is the versitility of the songs, which are well written and would fare just as well sans drum and bass ornamantation. Whats not so good is the irrelevancy of some of the later tracks, such as 'Law'. All in all, its an ambiguous and ambivalant album, as much as the man himself is."
1,cacaphony,"I've been a big David Bowie fan since 1974. I have all of his albums except a live album and some greatest hits compilations, and I love most of them, but I can't stand ""Earthling"". It's a lot--I mean a lot--of noise--I mean noise--piled upon some very trite and insipid musical fragments. And--this is a small point considering how painful every else about this album is--David Bowie is singing out of tune."
2,Bowie Meets Electronica,"Despite a couple of impressive songs (the energetic ""Little Wonder"" or ""Dead Man Walking""), this Bowie attempt at trying drum n` bass/ trip-hop/ electro territory turns out a bit uneven and not too engaging. It`s a competent and listenable effort, still most of the moments here are just curious yet ultimately forgettable experiments. While it`s not downright bad, it ends up being tiresome and far from gripping. It already souds dated at parts, which doesn`t help, although I can see how it was a breath of fresh air when it came out in the mid-nineties.A decent album, but far from a keeper."
3,Decent,"There's nothing really original or inventive about this album and Reeves Gabrels's guitar playing was mixed very loudly, so much so that it nearly drowns out Bowie. It's halfway decent, though and fairly entertaining if you keep an open mind to it. This one is probably best bought used."
2,"Where did you go, Bowie?","David Bowie has definately changed, for the worse. Bowie has changed from classic rock to electronica. I am disappointed. Bowie and eletronica do not mix. Maybe I don't like this cd because I'm a fan of David Bowie's old music. So, if you are an old fan, I advise that you do not buy this cd."
4,Earthling,"Earthling was released in 1997 and showcases a strong influence of elctronica. Earthling contained such hits as ""I'm Afraid of Americans"", ""Little Wonder"" and ""Telling Lies"" . The cd booklet has Bowie in a union jack inspired coat the rest of the booklet is really od and confusing. In fact I do not know how to explain it. 4/5."
5,The best of the best,"A definitive guide that not only is written in fine detail allowing the reader to understand the concepts of form to function, but clear and large photographs make the text relevant and real. Not sure how the loin relates to hip in underlying bony structure and why the relationship is important? If that prospect you're considering purchasing built uphill, downhill or somewhere inbetween? Depending on his build, in which specialty does his talent lie? Thomas breaks down the various body parts and puts them all back together again so the reader will come away with a better understanding of the whole.This book doesn't get bogged down in paleontology and eohippus, but gets right to the point with useful information. Then use that knowledge to evaluate several horses in the final chapter.This is a highly recommended study guide, written in plain english. Yet it is delightful to read. It will surely become the definitive guide for anyone serious about equine conformation."
5,Great book,"This book is very clearly written and easy to use. The diagrams are easy to read, unlike some other books on conformation. I've learned a great deal and I would highly recommend this book."
5,A Wonderful Read! I Loved It!,"Having waded through the endless swamp of so many dull, uninspired children's books, I was pleasantly surprised when I found this novel. That's because Swords for Hire is a special children's book indeed. It will definitely hold your kids' attention. Of course, you really can't go wrong with a story that has a king, a dungeon, a damsel in distress and a villain named Boneman.Will Allen has done a masterful job of building the story and makes it easy for the young reader to follow along. His characters have delightful names like Rigby Skeet, King Olive and Boonder, and although the plot bears a passing resemblance to others, the offbeat story itself is all Will Allen's. And it's a good one.Swords for Hire is one of the few children's books out these days that is fun for kids as well as adults. Very enjoyable. You'll love it."
4,Swords for Hire,"Swords for hire ,is about a teenage young man joining the Royal Guards and meets up with an insane mentor to rescue the imprison King.The lack of knowledge from his mentor and the inexperience of his apprentice makes for a lot of fun.Mostly childrens fantasy adventure.Michael Tsapazis author of ""Zion and the Magic Sword"""
1,Not a whole lot here worth your time...,"There are some funny moments, and an occasional spark of brilliance, but this read is mostly tedious. It feels like a first novel--but more than that, if feels like a first novel that wouldn't normally find a publisher.I hate to speak ill of the dead, but this book isn't very well-written.Looking for fun and funny--and well written--SF/Fantasy? Read Douglas Adams, Tom Holt, Robert Asprin or Terry Pratchett."
2,Should be titled 'I'm so great',"I was hoping to use this book to plan a trip to Africa to climb Kili but really there's not enough substance here. The author's constant reminder of all the feats he's accomplished and other people he's bettered (Whitney climb, Grand Canyon hike etc) is just plain annoying. Its an easy read and if that's what you're looking for, great. If you want some details for a trip keep looking."
5,good vitamins,Helps me manage my appetite and keep my energy levels up so I'm not so tiredThe price is right.
2,Poor description,"When the product was received it was wrapped very well, but upon opening it, I found the spine broken from the book. The book itself is fine."
2,heroine is a tad overwrought,"I might have given it more stars if the heroine were more intelligent and less overwrought. I did enjoy reading it, but Fran seems too obsessed with Bragg to think coherently. She disapproves of her brother-in-law's fidelity but yet she can kiss/make out with Bragg. I find it unbelieveable that she could have forgetten to tell Bragg about his wife's impending return to NY since it has consumed her mind for several days. I was growing tired of her lies whenever anyone implied she was interested in Hart, whom I preferred to Bragg. (At least he isn't married!) I also thought she could have wounded Craddock before he captured her because he didn't seem to have a gun at that point."
5,"""Wicked Fun""","Just so much fun that it brings a smile to your face....Brenda Joyce defintely has hit the mark with this series. For those who would like to be invited into the lives of Fran, Hart, and Rick be prepared... The whole family will join in the fun by the time you get to Deadly Desire...Make sure you read them in sequence for it only makes it more enjoyable...I'm waiting for the next one and can't wait for the story line to explode...For romance and mysteries make great partners !"
2,Not as desireable as previous books in series---,"I became acquainted with Brenda Joyce by purchasing Deadly Love because it was in the mystery section of a local bookstore and found myself intrigued by the heroine, plot line, time frame, and sensuality of her writing. I have also read Deadly Affairs, Deadly Pleasures,and was greatly anticipating Deadly Desire. Alas, I was sadly disappointed! It doesn't begin to live up to the other books, and seems to have been written in a great hurry and perhaps by several people writing different chapters. Whatever, the author needs to refrain from such frequent use of ""she/he started and stared"" ( this was in every other sentence!), and in general do more justice to her characters and tie up the dangling story lines: Connie and Neil, Evan/Sarah/Maggie, etc., and get on with Francesca and her frustrations. Enough already."
2,Extremely disappointed with this book.,"Being an avid reader of all of Brenda Joyce's books, I was truly let down with the ending of this book. You're just left hanging as to the outcome of Fran's love life. Not to mention her brother's as well as her sister's. If this is truly the last book of the Deadly series then shame on the author and the publisher."
3,"Good, but too many errors.","I loved the story and the characters. However, Ms. Joyce and/or her editors should have proofread this book better. There are noticeably more than the average number of typos (some constituting real words which leave you confused for a few moments until you figure out what she really meant to say). Also, a few story consistency errors - example: one man's wife's grandfather is referred to as the woman's grandfather and then a sentence or two later, he's referred to as the man's father-in-law (should be ""grandfather-in-law""). In addition, the tendancy for people to be incredibly over-politically correct really annoys me, but even being of German descent, I was offended by Ms. Joyce's choice for the Indian character's last name as ""Savage"" - not that it isn't a legitimate surname, but I think it shows obvious insensitivity and poor judgment on her part to use it for that character."
4,This series just keeps getting better.,"After reading this book I really felt for Fran, that poor young woman was ripped in half by the one man that she really loved, and by one Calder Hart who really wants her, but knows that she will never love him. I wanted to rip Bragg's wife arms off how could she be so mean to Fran,when she does not love him either, she only wants to use him so he can reach his political glory and then more than likely drop him just so she can get more money out of him. Sorry, I had to get that off my chest. The only reason that I gave this book four stars was because I do not remember her solving the case of who ripped Sally's paintings up. Brenda when will your next Francesa Cahill novel be coming out?"
2,Disappointing and muddled,"I've read the previous Francesca Cahill novels and enjoyed them enough to purchase this one. But, it was disappointing and unbelievable from the beginning. Francesca severely burns her hand while catching the villian in the previous book but is up the next day racing around town, using her hands, as if nothing had happened. The editor must have been napping on this one. Things are said to have happened ""this morning"" when they clearly should have happened ""yesterday morning"". While the premise of these stories is interesting, I got bored with Francesca and had trouble finishing this one. Francesca has abandoned her college classes without a second thought, can't decide which brother she loves, ignores any opinion she disagrees with and pushes orphans on the police commissioner and than promptly forgets about them. Ms. Joyce should either have Francesca grow up or put this series to bed."
4,This one will hold your attention!,"Set in 1902. New York City's Police Commissioner Rick Bragg was dragged into another crime investigation with Francesca Cahill. This time Francesca was out to help her best friend, Sarah Channing. Sarah's home had been broken into and a few of the paintings she had been creating had been destroyed. But was it an attack against Sarah or against one of the two people who were the subjects of the paintings that had been destroyed?Add to this a love triangle involving Francesca, Rick, and Calder, as well as, someone stalking Lucy (Rick and Calder's sister).**** This book is a mixture of adventure, excitement, and mysteries. The love triangle seems to continue in each book of the series. There is always something going on to hold the attention of the readers. Great reading! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,a novel about my birthplace,"Reading this book was a surreal experience for me. As a born and bred Tasmanian and one who grew up in Hobart, I found it hard to read in places. This is a beautifully told tale of one of the most unforgivable and barbaric acts. The brutal extermination of the Tasmanian Aborigines and the Tasmanian tiger show that the British still have so much ""blood on their hands"". So many of the places recorded in the book are personal to me - Flinders Island, Hobart, Launceston, Battery Point - indeed it is strange reading a work of fiction based on such familiar fact. English Passengers feels a little less successful as an adventure story and the plot mechanics become a little worn towards the end but as a treatise on the harshness of ""white mans rule"" it cannot be matched. A must read for anyone interested in Australian history, particularly Tasmanian history."
3,An Enjoyable Diversion,"And now for something different...The cover art seems to convey very well the tilted style of writing contained within. I found it very amusing and easy to read. Despite the light hearted style however, the book carries a dark theme, resplindent with the evil nature of mankind. Like real life however the author doesn't smack you too hard with the facts, so that if you choose to do so, you may ignor them and simply enjoy the sceenery. Read this if you think you need a change of pace from your regular reading list material."
1,Dissapointing,"This book was recommended to me by someone I highly respect but turned out to be a bit of a disapointment. It was a good tale, but it certainly did drag and was difficult to get thru. If I wasn't one who like to finish everything I start, I would have quit about halfway thru and now wish I had."
2,Deceiving,Reading the editorial reviews and seeing the cover of this book were very deceiving. I expected much more than I got. I loved THE HORNBLOWER SAGA and have a degree in Anthropology so I thought this book would be for me. Was I mistaken! I found this to be very slow moving and often just plain boring. I couldn't wait to finish this so I could start something good. Don't waste your time.
2,A new form of literature - the disjointed narrative!,"I too had high hopes of a great high seas adventure, only to be dissappointed by sinking narration. Most of the characters were less than sea-worthy."
1,"I can't say it's poorly written, but...","Frankly, the characters angered me so greatly that I literally threw the book across the room in disgust many a time. Some people think such passion evocation would equal a good book, but I completely hated it. I only finished it to exert my will over it- I couldn't let it beat me. I do not recommend it at all if you're looking for something you'll ENJOY reading."
5,Terrific Read,"What a wonderful book- fascinating, moving, funny, intelligent; this book has it all, and written in a beautiful style that begs to be read. I'm recommending it to everyone!"
3,Killing with kindness and cruelty,"The destruction of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania is at the heart of this novel. Told by various characters in letter, journal entries, and eyewitness accounts; English Passengers sees the genocide of these people from many different viewpoints like those of racial supremacists, religous do-gooders, Manx sailors, and Peevay, the man who shows the reader what his people have lost. The skill of the author is evident by speaking in so many different voices, but it becomes a matter of style over substance. The emotional resonance is lost with all the shifting styles and commentaries. A valiant effort, but it left me wondering if any one character might have given this book more emotional weight; a weight this heinous crime deserves. I understand the author is using the amazing stupidity of many of his characters to make his comments for him, it just didn't quite work for me."
5,worth the effort,"If you are willing to put in a little effort over the first 30 pages this book will reward you for you tenacity. This is a brilliantly crafted tale told from multiple viewpoints; at first each snippet seems somewhat detached, but the strands are woven together to provide a satisfying and thought provoking read.This book should be compulsory reading for anyone embarking on a humanitarian mission. It makes you question what it is that we do today, that we genuinely think is right, but will so plainly be wrong when viewed from 150 years hence."
5,One of the greatest books ever written,"This book has it all: 20 distinct voices, a sea-faring adventure, hilarious awful characters, innocent beauty and a plot that veers into the most delightful and unexpected places. I love LOVE this book by Matthew Kneale. What a stunning accomplishment!"
4,"Intellectual epic, very good, unusual style, ""Dickens"" detail","I really enjoyed this book but not everyone will. It is not an easy ""beach book."" This is a thoughtful epic that is long and complex. The story is fascinating. It's told from many points of view -- at least 10 if I recall. The story always moves forward but from various viewpoints such as that of an Australian aborigine. It is handled superbly. I think this is sort of a ""Berkeley"" type book - I thoroughly enjoyed it, as did my UC Berkeley graduate son and even his wife who is new to the English language. Very different."
5,Great fun,"I loved this book. I came across it entirely by accident while searching for a hiking guide for Tasmania - and it was a real stroke of luck. I won't go on at length, since many people have written detailed and glowing reviews, but it is an extremely pleasant read - very funny, even as it also deals with some very serious themes. Pretty educational too. It turned out to be a fine introduction for my trip to Melbourne, where visits to local museums touch upon the historical events and themes treated in the novel. I won't say it's perfect - some of Dr. Potter's diary passages = rambling + indulgent in my view (although the early bits are hysterical), and I thought the culmination of the expedition to find the Garden of Eden fell a bit flat - but these are small criticisms. I started reading it before leaving for Australia and finished it, a happy and satisfied reader, as the plane was taking off from Melbourne. Highly recommended."
4,Grand voyage,"Though some may disagree about literary value of this book, I can not but say that it has captured my heart. Written in perspectives of main characters, offering two racurses, one of the passengers of the Sincerity and one of the aborigines and inhabitants of the penalty colony in Van Diemens land. Charactesr are presented very convincable, especially the priest, though some may find it as quite unapropriate attack on church and christianity, but that is the debate for some other place. If you're looking for amusement, or just want to spend some quality time read this book, you won't regret it"
5,A FRESH SLANT ON THE ANTIPODES,"There are three strands to this novel set in the 1850s; a nautical expedition to Tasmania in search of the Garden of Eden, the efforts of the Manx captain to discharge his cargo en route, and the increasingly desperate endeavours of the native Tasmanian aborigines to survive. Matthew Kneale juggles the thread successfully between a succession of different narrators, and the denouement is extremely satisfying."
4,English Passengers,"The book was fun and historic, especially if you have a Manx background. Even if not it was worth the read."
2,Ouch,"Looking for a ""sea tale""? Skip this one.By chance I picked this up on the way to Australia and made the critical error of judging this book by it's cover. Strong suit - nautical dust jacket art and salty Celtic personae from the 19th century. Weakness - unremarkable, irratating and languid roles.The hopscotch 30 year and dozen odd person narrative never developed and left me confused. Trying to pay attention to dated and disjointed ""Journal Entries"" and two dimensional characters, throughout an obscure era in Tasmanian history, only fueled my lack of interest. Unless you're truly turned on by Colonial Australian history, this will be a tough read.I was hooked by the nautical thread the book starts with, anticipated a payoff worthy of a 440 page read and was dissapointed. By the end I simply didn't care and was only comforted by the fact that I could donate this novel to charity. Ouch."
4,Geat Owl.,i had bought this product as an aid to a lesson i was teaching on camoflauge. the students loved the attention to detail and how durable the product was. i reccommend it to any teacher or parent that is looking for a lifelike educational puppet without the overpricing of other stores.
5,WHOOOOOOOOO!!!,This is one of my favorite plushes that I have purchased on amazon. It is not only a puppet where you can flap it's wings but it has a marionette neck stick so you can rotate its head. And even though it has the internal neck feature you can still hug it without worry of brakage. The wings also have velcro attachments so you can rest his wings behind him as a real bird would when perched.An EXCELENT job Folkmanis! :)
2,Returned it,Not very realistic looking and fur was not soft. Head spins all the way around (not very realistic depiction) and it was NOT a puppet!
4,Used but in very good condition,"The item description says that it is just a open box item, but I saw that it was a used item (probably for a very short time) in a very good condition, I have no complains about the service or delivery"
4,Very good quality,All good. High quality. Look nice on our deck. Only small issue is that the narrow portion in the middle conflicts with a larger part on our heating lamp.
5,happy camper,"This product is exactly as it was advertised. It fits our heater perfectly and looks nice out on our deck all winter. Is a little difficult to get on and off because of the height, luckily my husband is 6'4""."
5,How can they sell this so cheap?,This patio heater cover is well made out of rugged but attractive fabric. Good zippers make fitting easy. I just don't know how they can make it and sell it for this price. I would guess the price to be 3 or 4 times what it actually is.
4,Great Cover!,This cover is great! Nice heavy duty material and holds up well to all the rain in the winter months. My only complaint is the zipper is made of cheap plastic and the squirrels were able to eat through my first one so I had to buy a second one. Hopefully they don't bother with it this winter!
5,High Quality Cover,This is a high quality product that fit beautifully. Seems quite wind resistant and the color is a nice pleasing neutral color so it does not stick out. Took me a while to find this but very happy I did. Price was great for quality.
3,Luke Warm on Deck Heater,"The heater produces a small pocket of heat directly under the hood, which severely limits the numbe people it will warm. Also, even with a full tank installed in the base, the unit is top heavy and blew over on my deck on the first windy day, bending the hood, which took the brunt of the resulting damage. I needed to tie it to the deck railing to prevent it from occurring again."
5,great fit for our patio heater,we had trouble with our previous patio heater cover. It only covered the top portion of the heater. We live on the brow of the mountain with severe wind gusts at times. wind would catch in the top cover & turned our heater over warping the top. this cover eliminates any problems.
4,Quality Made Product,This is truly a great product. It's very well made. Easy to put on and take off. I've purchased other covers and they all last one season. This one is quality made and should last for many years. Very happy with it.
3,Arrived melted,Took long to arrived in Florida and was all melted. Don't order chocolates from far away sellers. First and last.
1,Patton Fan,"When the fan was delivered, it looked like the box had been through world war 2. The fan it's self was not what I expected. (there was nothing wrong with it that I know of) I returned the fan to the store."
1,Patton is not what it used to be,"I bought this fan in 2007 and the motor burnt out already, i hardly used this fan in the 4 years I had it, the last Patton I had lasted 15 years!!!! The quality from Patton is gone since they outsourced to china. The next fan I purchase will be made in the USA!!!!!!"
2,Okay for the shop,"All the speeds on this fan are too high. The lowest setting will blow you out of the room and makes too much noise to be tolerated for long.It would probably be fine in a wood shop or paint booth, but it is unusable as a room fan in your home."
3,Not The Patton Fan Of Old,"I have owned Patton's for years, the ones made in the USA. This fan is made in China. It is VERY Noisy. It does give off a real nice breeze but the noise level is so loud even at the lowest setting makes it hard to be in the same room."
1,BE VERY WARY OF THIS ITEM!!!!!!!,"I had my 2nd one (HLSU22003UC 20"" High Velocity Fan, 3 Speed, 23""x7""x23"", Chrome) for 3-4 days and it nearly caught fire. NO JOKE!!!! I had the speed set on high and the next thing I know was I heard the motor idling down all of the sudden to the lowest speed possible. I unplugged it immediately and good thing I did, because the motor was extremely hot, and I could smell something burning inside. I have owned 3 of these now in the last 2+ years. One just conked out 3-4 days ago after 2 year of use. Slightly different model than this one listed here though (Patton U2-1887 20-Inch High Velocity Whole-House Air Circulating Fan). Motor/Blades locked up on it. I now have the 3rd one up and running (Patton U2-2003-UC 20-Inch Velocity Air Circulating Fan) and will keep you posted on how this works out.P.S. I should also add that this particular fan/model once put together and running for the first time started making a humming noise right out of the box."
3,Not What It Used To Be...,"I *love* Patton fans, when they were made in the US. I had a great 20 inch fan that we had outside for our dog. It was evidently prior to changing where Patton makes this fan. Our old fan was solid, supporting piece was all one piece, didn't make tons of noise (just some you would expect from moving air like it did), had a metal blade, easy clips to open the cage for cleaning, etc.This fan (as mentioned by other reviewers) has plastic blades, tie wraps to close, a two piece screwed together metal support bar and sounds like a mower engine. The only reason that I like it is that it seems to move air.If this were for use in our house, we would be sending it back. We have 4 14 inch old style Pattons and I intent to baby them as much as I can. Sure can't replace them now! Not with the quality that Patton is turning out now. I need to start looking now for quality fans as Patton is no longer what they used to be!"
5,"Great, well built fan and powerful","Great powerful fan, well built and moves plenty of air in a 3,000 square foot home. I put it in a box in a window and it works great."
5,great buy,"I live in a one bedroom apartment in Southern California. The main room has an old wall air conditioner unit and the secondary room has only a window for ventilation. I placed this fan in the small hallway/doorway between the two rooms. It is so powerful that all of my papers would be blowing everywhere on the lowest setting. But, it has a cool feature where it can pivot so that the fan is parallel to the ceiling. I think that is the best circulation I can get from a fan without stirring up my papers. This fan is very sturdy compared to the tower or plastic fans I have used before. One thing though, is that it produces loud white noise. It does not bother me while I am working, but I think it would for someone sensitive to noise in their bedroom. I think it is loud simply because it moves a lot of air. I bought this at a home and garden supply place for $40.00 and at that price--it was a great buy."
3,Not the same.,"This fan is ok, but not nearly the same quality and performance as the Patton fan I bought 15 plus years ago. They cheapened the fan to keep the price point. By the way, the old fan just keeps on blowing!"
3,"This is far from a bad fan, but I've seen better.","I got this as a second fan. My first is a Haier of the same size. Both fans cool to about the same degree, but this fan is a bit noisier. The main problem, however, is in the stability of this fan's construction. I've tightened the joints over and over again, but they keep coming loose. I have to get my wrench out every other day to keep it in one piece. This is my primary complaint, and I think it's a big one. If I order a large metal fan, I do it because I expect sturdiness. This is anything but sturdy."
1,konabob,"My 5year old 20"" Patton fan started cycling on and off due to overheating of the motor. I bought a ""new"" replacement from Amazon. Upon arrival I noticed that the fan shipping box had been retaped and the inside plastic wrappings were torn. When I turned on the new 3speed fan it only had 1speed, high. I returned it for a full refund incl shipping.I chose Patton because of its high efficiency in moving air. My old Patton was made in the US, the new in China. I think Patton needs to have better QC in China."
4,Portable Wind Tunnel,"This fan is really powerful. If you want more than a gentle breeze, this bad boy is for you. It will cool off a hot room quickly. The only drawback is it's noisy. That's why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. But for sheer cooling power, this fan is a winner."
1,Poor Fan,Bought this fan about a year ago and it quit working this year. Very hard to find someone to complain to. Fan made in China and has never worked right.
2,A stinging disappointment,"The followup to the superb ""Moveable Feast"" is a stinging disappointment, simply put. This is the last Thrillbilly album, as the band has chosen to break up and this is a weak set to go out with. The songs are okay, but the energy is gone and the great mix of melody, seering guitar riffs, and pounding rhythm section are nowhere to be found. It would be okay if this were a debut album, but Thrillbilly set themselves a higher standard and failed to meet it."
5,Finicky Older Dog Loves This All Natural Dog Food,"My older pooch just loves this food and believe me I have tried all kinds. This food is all natural and made from Human Quality Ingredients. Small nuggets, made from chicken (not beef) and reduced calorie for a less active adult dog. She won't eat anything else !!"
3,Connected directly from Airport enabled iMac,"The Amazon product description says ""print to [the iP5200R] from an individual WiFi-enabled computer. "" I had a heck of a time setting it up, but eventually I managed to get it configured. The first time I set it up, I think I made a mistake at step 12 of the instructions for setting it up, although I really can't be sure.If, somehow, Canon and/or Apple could make the setup process less fragile, I would give it 5 stars. As it is, if you want to print wirelessly without buying a router and setting up a network, this works, and its not like there are a lot of options."
1,Ink-aholic printer,"This printer guzzles ink like a Hummer drinks gas. I almost ALWAYS use grayscale printing and yet it consistently runs out of one of its 3 expensive color cartridges (which means you have to replace them before printing anything at all). I also have gotten incorrect error messages on numerous occasions - it's a tempermental little bugger.I get ten times as much ink out of a cartridge for my HP printer, and only need to keep track of two cartridges. I will never buy anything BUT a Hewlett Packard again. I am ready to throw this machine out on the street!"
2,"Corny at first, yet vivid and memorable","I just read the 1953 paperback of The Sword of Rhiannon by Leigh Brackett. Like her other work in this vein you have to suspend your disbelief, as the means of getting into this fairy-tale world is corny (in the same way that Star Trek is or will be one day.) But if you go along with it you find the stock characters trying a bit harder than most to convince you they are for real. The hero is Carse, mercenary, educated treasure hunter who gets mixed up with the disembodied Rhiannon. The woman, Ywain, enslaves him but the tables are soon turned. Rhiannon will finally get control of Carse's body but not before Carse manages to upset the whole careful balance of society. So who gets the girl? c'mon, read the book.Brackett admitted that plotting was the hardest aspect for her, but for her efforts she found logical circumstances to back up the formulas."
5,The Sword of Rhiannon,"I first read this back in the late 60's when I came across a dog-eared copy at a used bookstore. Having already read the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, I quickly got caught-up in this story that starts and ends on a dying Mars. Back then, the fact that most of the story takes place on a ""wet"" Mars was more fantasay than science fiction. Today, we know that there once was a ""wet"" Mars. It's a great book by a great author, Leigh Brackett."
1,took way too long to ship,"I ordered this book for a latin class i am taking. I ordered the book a week before my first exam and paid for overnight shipping. I did not receive the book for another month!!! I wouldn't have paid the extra $5 for express shipping if they weren't even going to send it out for another 3 weeks! I could have just bought it at the book store for a few extra bucks and gotten a better grade on my exam. The condition was exactly as described, but i would not pay extra for shipping or expect to receive the book in less than 3 weeks"
1,Defective out of the box.,"This product features a 'remote' that does not work. The fan section worked properly but the remote feature was important to me, and after wasting even more of my money to purchase extra batteries to ensure that it was not merely a battery problem, I attempted to return the unit to Amazon. Unfortunately, they refused to accept the return despite the defect because I had waited more than thirty days to open the unit. Amazon even refused to offer me a credit toward purchase of a working unit. To add injury to insult, the item sent to me had been previously returned by another customer who left the manual filthy and covered with fingerprints.Overall, this is a cheap unit, and the fans work, so I would suggest purchasing the model without the remote if you must have a Holmes. But the best solution would be to steer clear of the brand entirely. And perhaps consider your local hardware store where reasonable requests for an exchange are honored."
4,Hot Girls And Some Laugh's,Hot Girls with lots of skin and it also made me laugh a few times. Not the best movie ever but worth a look!
4,great value,"We prefer these glowsticks for a couple of reasons. First, they are 10"" instead of 8. That extra 2"" makes it much easier for an adult. Secondly, they are bright! We use them in the tent as a night light when we go to bed. they are just bright enough to let you you find your shoes for those middle of the night runs."
2,Not as bright as coleman sticks,"We bought this to go camping and thought that it would be a nice treat for all the kids. We broke open 30 of the bracelets and 10 were duds completely and the rest varied in brightness, one was too big around for the wrist and we had to string them together. I did like that the bracelets were tricolored that was a surprise there was several color combos."
5,Great Buy!,I purchased these for the kids on Halloween to put on while Trick or Treating - they loved them and we could see where they were. Great Buy!
2,Meh.,I bought this because I like the arias but the quality is pretty mediocre and so is the singer. I never listen to it.
4,Great for the price!,"Connects easily to your shower head. NOTE: the connector may be metal-colored but is plastic, so even though you may want to tighten the two pieces really well, you can't. You will have to add additional caulking/adhesive/apoxy so that water doesn't leak from different places.The water flow from the nozzle is stronger than expected, a pleasant surprise. The on/off function is basically a metal triangular piece that fits to hold the on/off in place, so if that breaks (it's not sturdy), than you'll have to resort to turning the water on/off with the shower/bath faucet handles.Despite those two things, the price and convenience makes this product worth having, especially since I got it when Amazon's price dropped."
2,"leaky, then low water pressure","When I firt installed it, it leaked from all three places that connected. I took it off, reapplied the tape, and it stopped. However, THEN the water pressure on the hose attachment became pitiful, to the point where the water dribbled out with no force. Also, when the button wasn't pressed, it now leaked out the sprayer holes too. I am not sure why, as the first time I hooked it up it was fine. Also, the button on the sprayer is loose, like something is either halfway broken or it just wasn't made well to begin with. I am returning this. Petco has another brand I will take a look at."
5,I am so glad I bought this!,I just love this pet shower for my dog and he just loves it too! It was well worth the money. I will also use it to clean my shower!
5,easy install - makes bath a breeze!,Great product. Simple to install & use.We got this for our pit/lab mix that doesn't like bath time. This makes it much easier on us.
2,Very poor quality!,"This would have been a pretty good product, but it leaked. I put the tape that came with it on, but it still leaked. I had to return this item, and order a different kind of pet shower hose. They sure don't make these like they used to. I had one previously that had begun to leak, but I had it for several years, before it started leaking. I was replacing it because of the leaking, and got a brand new one that leaked. Very disappointing. The other type I got, you have to reach up and turn the water off by the faucet handle, instead of being able to just temporarily shut it off from the sprayer. Even that one is a little annoying, because of not having that feature to it, but at least it don't leak. I would prefer to be able to stop the water flow, through the sprayer end, but I guess they don't make them like that anymore."
3,Quick Release Shower Rinse,Product works well BUT needs a real metal fitting rather than the plated plastic. I understand there is one; just sell it that way in the first place. Will save retrofit time and expense.
3,Works fine.,"Installation is straight forward. Spray is rather weak for hosing down a largish dirty dog, But it does the job."
5,Bathing with ease!,"exactly what I was looking for! Rinse Ace 3-way Pet Shower Sprayer bought from Petco Storefront via Amazon. I just tested it and works great! Easy to install. Easy to adjust how strong you'd like the water to be and can ""Pause"" in between too. I know I will bathe our Pomeranian later with much ease. Great solution oppose to using a bucket and dipper plus my daughter giving an extra hand in the tub while bathing our Pomeranian. Thanks!"
3,"Messy and leaks, but the length is good.","The only feature that is nice is the length which is the only reason I kept it. It leaks from the part you spray and it only has one spray option---super hard fast. The water flow when sprays startles my little dog. It makes bath time messy. If I hadn't of waited past the return date to open the package, I would definitely have tried to return it."
3,nice but too small,"This nice leather flip case is actually designated for the Tungsten T Palm only. Eagerly awaited, I had to return it because it is too small for my Tunsten E Palm. Belkin makes a case that fits almost every PDA, but you can't tell from these descriptions which one you are buying."
3,Brilliant! Functional! Fragile?,"Like many guys, I suffer from a pocket shortage. And trying to grab a pocketed PDA while driving (to use the voice recorder!) can be downright dangerous. So I picked up one of these...All was well for about two weeks, then the belt clip broke. Now it's back in my pocket.Five stars for functionality, minus two for structural integrity."
4,"Good balance of humor, romance and mystery","What a delightful book this was! A good balance of mystery, a little suspense, a little romance, red herrings - this book had it all, along with a whimsical guardian angel full of spunk. The book was somewhat of a cross between an Aunt Dimity mystery or a Donna Andrews (""Murder with Peacocks""), both the ""lighter"" style of mystery, with an aim to entertain. The book succeeded in doing just that. A great quick read."
4,Similar to Nick Charles Mysteries,"This is a refreshing read - similar to the 1940 Nick Charles mystery series - full of real mystery, some murder, plots evolving around family and community characters - and fun --- lots of fun reading due to the appearance of a guardian angel by the name of Augusta Goodnight. You finish reading by wishing Augusta would pay a visit to your life. Augusta makes the story - and leaves the strawberry smell of happiness for days. I am only sorry there are just 4 books so far. Please read - these stories will give you days of pleasure."
4,Good,Takes a little figuring out but pretty amazing for the price. Apparently I have to add 9 more words for this review to go through.
2,Deceptive and Closed,"Don't be deceived in to buying off-the-shelf Compact Flash (SanDisk, etc.) This box is proprietary in the worst sense here. Only Boss Compact Flash will work. Very bad/stupid decision on their part."
4,Great Spanish CD,I love this Spanish CD. i am fluent in Spanish and it's hard to find a good Spanish CD. My little one loves the music and poems in this CD.
5,Best weapon against Spider Mites,"I've tried at least five different chemical products that claim to kill and prevent spider mites but none were truly affective - until the Ortho. This really worked well. I saw immediate results and the spider mites have been dramatically reduced in their impact. I cannot claim ""total victory"" because a small group of mites returned a few months after about three rounds of spraying the Ortho, but that group has been easily controlled since and I have reason for optimism that they won't return next spring. If you've got spider mites, don't waste time trying other options. Get the Ortho and stick with their instructions."
2,It did wear out quickly,"I used this to do 12 cross cuts on 3""x1.5"" x .25 thick channel steel which it did with ease. I noticed that with each cut there were more and more sparks being generated. I then switched to cutting down 2.5"" x2.5"" x .25 thick angle iron to 2.5"" x 1.0"" x .25. More and more sparks until after about 3 feet it stopped cutting. Feeds and speeds were not excessive. Note that the Metal Devil is advertised as cutting steel like butter. It did, but not long enough for the $$$."
1,Not strong enough,"This frame seemed like a good thing for about one week and then it broke. One of the connections between a leg, supports, and a strap under the mattress snapped off, and it is impossible to fix. The person using the mattress does not weigh over 300 pounds, the supposed weight limit of the frame. This is not a sturdy object."
3,looks can be deceiving,"This picture shows an air-filled mattress, but it doesn't say anywhere that it is NOT included. That was a surprise. They are not that expensive to purchase, but I did not expect it not to have one. Other than that, the frame looks very sturdy. I have not tried it yet, as I have to purchase an air-filled mattress, but it looks like it will work very well. ENDED UP RETURNING THIS PRODUCT. IT WAS DANGEROUS. VERY BAD PRODUCT, WOULD ONLY GIVE IT ONE STAR FOR QUICK SHIPPING."
3,Sorrowful black/death but not too extreme,"First of all, I am not going to write a horrible review on this disc. I did enjoy the musicianship and feel I experienced while listening to this piece. There are alot of great elements to this disc including the lyrics, riffs, and spectacular drumming. However, I personally enjoy the morbidness and hate filled lyrics of true black metal, for example Darkthrone. Anyway, my tastes could be different than yours so I'm sure you will take this review with a grain of salt. However, I do encourage you to purchase this release as it will be a great addition to your death/black metal collection...not the best...but a good investment."
1,Garbage,"Bought one. Didn't work. Called their tech support. After being put through typical basics (power cycle unit, try different cables, etc.) was instructed to return it for a new switch.Went through the same thing with second switch. This time I will get store credit and cut my losses."
1,"Nice package, horrible product","I got this KVM switch yesterday and hooked it up to my laptop and my old desktop. The laptop would display properly on the monitor, but the desktop wouldn't. Plugging the desktop in directly confirms that my DVI port works. Also the switch would tend to lose the connection with my keyboard. I spent 3 hours repeatedly rebooting my computers, but I could never get the switch to work properly."
2,IOGear DVI CS1764,"I got this device to connect two laptops and two desktops, to one screen and one keyboard and mouse. The Mouse is a Microsoft Intellimouse, and the keyboard is a MS internet keyboard Pro, none of these devices work with the IOgear CS1764. I have to plug my mouse and keyboard on the back of the CS1764, to be able to use them, but lose all the keyboard short cuts functionality. Also after some hours the USB devices plug on the back are not available to the my windows or linux OS, requiring me to unplug and plug the devices again."
5,Works great with Macs,"I am using this to connect a PowerMac G5 and a Powerbook/MacBook to a 20'' Cinema Display. No setup required, works like a charm. I would highly recommend this unit to all Mac users. The only thing one has to be careful about is the fact that >20'' Cinema Displays are NOT supported."
4,Worth the Money,"I needed this KVMP, it works pretty good. Only one issue with starting up a computer when not currently on that channel. The other computer when you finally switch to it is nowhere close to the resolution it should be. You have restart the computer with the channel selected, or sometimes you can get the computer to switch to the right res by turning off the monitor and resetting the IOGEAR"
2,IOGEAR 2-Port KVMP,"The construction is solid. I am impressed with the buttons which have good tactile as well as audio and visual feedback. However the internal electronics is not as good. Randomly but frequently, when I switch computers the screen will come up properly for several seconds and then go blank for several seconds before coming back. Thereafter it is solid. The keyboard, sound and mouse all work without a hitch. However it is hard to use them when the screen is a blank."
2,PC/Mac KVM,Got this device to be able to help transition from Windows PC to Mac. Was helpful in getting rid of the second monitor but lots of trouble when switching with video resolution. Was useful but not worth the $$$ spent.
3,"Nice product when it works, still trying to get mine repaired","The product has many nice features and is overall easy to use. However, after a little more than a month, my second DVI port stopped functioning. I am now trying to see how good that 3 year warranty is, but currently the IOGEAR technical support is asking for FAXed proof of purchase before they will even allow me to fill out the request for an RMA #. I am not so sure of the products long term quality, and hopefully this is only a isolated case and not the norm. Now where did I put that Amazon packing slip....."
5,Simple Easy Set up.,"Simple set up, good quality. Had no issues, I'm using 2 macs. Great quality cables included."
3,"Can Toni Take ""The Heat?""","Not since the days of Stock Aitken Waterman has a producer enjoyed as much popularity as Rodney Jerkins. Unfortunately, like Stock Aitken Waterman, Rodney Jerkins' work is patented and predictable, making his musical longevity seem as unlikely as a Jackson 5 reunion. Jerkins' work on Brandy & Monica's ""The Boy Is Mine"" put him on the map and his recent collaboration with Destiny's Child, ""Say My Name,"" produced a No.1 single. However, when a respected artist like Toni Braxton asks him to produce her latest studio effort, THE HEAT, it appears she has become an imitator, not an innovator. Au contraire. While Jerkins' production is dull and unimaginative, Toni Braxton's sultry vocals make this slinky single delicious ear candy. While the tune hasn't convinced me to take to THE HEAT, we can certainly expected greater things in the future from this divine diva."
2,resin chair cover,"Although the covers are well made and attractive, they are made to fit the smallest of resin chairs. So if you have very small chairs they work well. Unfortunately,I have to find new CHAIRS to fit my slipcovers now!"
2,veranda chair slip cover,recd very fast - nice fit - very well made - start to discolor and mold immediately and when washed fall apart and stains do not come off in wash no matter what product you use to remove
5,Pink Optical Mouse,This product is excellent. I purchased it for my laptop. It's easy to carry. Just plug it in and use it.
2,Not the book for at-home moms looking for tips,"If you work outside the home, and want to assuage guilt, then the book may work for you. For moms at home, look for a better book."
1,Useless.,"Bought this product to try and recharge my cell phone after forgetting my charger at home. Bottom line: Cell phone still dead and I'm out twenty bucks.Mind you, it looks like it's working. The lights flash and the cell phone gets warm, but even hours later the cell phone is still dead. I just hope the useless piece of junk hasn't burned out my battery. (And yes, I did put the batteries in the right way around.)"
1,Meant only to sell expensive Li battery,"Greed. Greed. Greed.It is not the contact problem but the voltage issue. The charger is designed not to take NiMH voltage which is 1.2V to 1.35V. And intentionally make not to start. It shall works with expensive primary cell, best with lithium, off course.At least the printer company subsidizes the printer to sell you cartridges, energizer hack you on every front."
2,Energiser Cell Phone charger Letdown,"I purchased several chargers for members of my family as Xmas Gifts. I thought it was really neat and would also be great in emergencies. Well, they hardly fit any phone in the family. Only one out of 5 worked and that is because only one phone had a USB port. Big Letdown ."
3,Wouldn't work with my rechargeable AA's,"I bought this with the intention of using it with my vast supply of rechargeable AA's, however to my surprise I discovered that it would only work with non-rechargeable batteries. In fact it wouldn't even work with brand new Duracell Alkaline AA's. Apparently it will only work with Energizers, though I'm not sure how that's technically possible. As often as I would expect to use this to recharge my Evo Shift when I'm out an about, I would be buying and throwing away an awful lot of non rechargeable batteries, which isn't very cost effective and isn't great for the environment. It works pretty well with the supplied Energizers that come with it, and it does have both Micro and Mini USB connectors, but because of the limitations it only rates 3 stars from me."
3,Review of Energizer Energi To Go Mini & Micro USB Tips Cel2musb,"Purchased for my phone - This thing worked great for my last phone - T-mobile MDA. I have a G3 now, which sucks a battery like you wouldn't believe. This charges it for about 5 minutes, then just quits. I have to remove the battery from the phone to get a response from either one after that. I just don't get why it'd work for a few minutes, then quit. I haven't tried this on other stuff yet."
5,For disaster work,Batteries are usually brought in to disaster areas for use by disaster workers and victims alike. I bought four of these to power my smartphone (HTC Inspire) which is a current hog. They work when you can't be tied to a charging source. Mine came with both the mini and micro plug. An improvement would be a usb jack in the charger instead of the 3/32 mono phone jack. I'm looking for a 3/32 extension cord so I can leave the charger in my pocket instead of dangling off the bottom of my phone (hard on the jack). Someone should build one of these with maybe six AA and a usb jack.
1,only 10% charged with Lithium battries!!,"I have the Droid Charge smartphone. This charged was plugged in when the battery died and it was only charged to 10% with BRAND NEW ENERGIZER batteries. If you need something to help you make that ONE call, this may be helpful. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,Works - Kinda!,"Included batteries were dead. Used 2 freshly charged Energizer rechargeable batteries and it worked. Unfortunately, you have to keep the batteries out of the charger or the batteries will drain - quickly! It is also difficult to remove/insert the batteries. It works, but only with a bit of planning and work. Isn't this supposed to be for people like me who can't remember to charge their phone?"
5,Great companion to the CWIM,"This is a great book offering guidelines to publishers and agents and is an excellent companion to the CWIM. If you write kidlit and want to be published, get an agent or find out the latest guidelines for magazine and book publishers, this book often has more in its listings than the CWIM. It's great to confirm editor's names and other pertinent info. too. This is the first time I've ordered this book and I'm glad I did. In some ways, I like it even better than the CWIM (Children's writers/illustrators markets)"
2,"outdated, inacurate","At first I was very happy with the book until I researched several of the publishers listed as accepting unsolicited manuscripts and found that that was no longer true. One publisher even stated online that since 2008 they have not been accepting unsolicited manuscripts but the book, published in 2011, said they still did. Five out of ten publishers I researched had different information than the book published. All in all I'm dissapointed with the whole book publishing industry, authors that don't research publishers and flood publishers with manuscripts that don't fit their list, and also this inacurate, incompletely researched book."
1,Not Reliable,"Stop working after 6 months of installation. Motion detector changes sensitivity on it own. Light comes on for only 4 seconds then goes off, no matter what setting you have it on. Yes it has a 5 year warranty, but after shipping cost you haven't gained anything. I'm looking for a better product."
2,Outside lighting,This light works well as long as the wind isn't blowing. During a recent 'blow' I covered the motion censor with duck tape and it still kept coming on. I stood and watched it and it wasn't leaves blowing by that caused it.
3,Andre's Travels,"I have read a couple of books by Andre Gide and I wasn't overly impressed. I still have a copy of ""The Counterfeiters"" which, I understand, is more worthy of the author that the other two I read. I saw ""Urien's Voyage"" and opted to take another look. I came away again realizing that Gide goes in directions that I'm not that interested in following.I could tell from this early work of his that Gide has a fertile mind as well as a descriptive style of writing. His issues with his sexuality are certainly present in this short work of his. It reads like a sort of ""Oddysey"" without the combat. Urien and his fellow travelers encounter many different things in their voyage and most of them are certainly worthy of comment. The final two pages seem out of style with the rest of the book but they are actually an essential part of understanding what Gide is trying to say. I tried following what he was trying to say but I eventually realized that I really wasn't all that interested."
4,Worth It!,"Reproduction is clean and crisp, though obvious that it has been scanned from an original copy as you can see some pixelation of the characters. This is not objectionable however. Binding appears good also. If interested in this piece of history, well worth the money."
4,"Not a necessary purchase, but fun for completists.","We were just using plain ol' 10 sided dice for our Munchkin games. Buying these isn't that essential, but they are fun to have. Gigantic 10-siders in different colors are nice, but the best part are the extra cards that come with it. Very nice addition."
4,Munchkin D10 set,"Well, first of all this is not a stand alone, it's a small expansion to the Munchkin card game. The dice are excellent for play: they're big, cool colors and changing the 10 for the munchkin face gives a nice touch. The cards that come in the set are as always fun to read and fun to play with. I've rated this set 4 stars because this game is not for everybody, you basically have to like the fantasy rpg genre and understand things like the difference of race and class and such, but for those that do get it the game is awesomely fun."
2,Made a common mistake,"This isn't so much the seller or products fault, however make darn sure when you order one of these, it fits your drill. I didn't realize the shaft was way to large to fit my drill so I am stuck with a tool I cannot use."
4,One of the Best Movie Figures,"This is easily one of the best movie version Transformer figures.First, the durability is well above most of the other figures. After some figures with poor durability and design (Blackout, Brawl, Bumblebee), I've been very impressed with this figure. If there's only one toy to get a kid, this one probably has the best chance of survival.Second, the transformation is relatively straightforward. Unlike some of the others, whose transformations rival the complexity of the more mature ""Alternators"" line, this one seems well suited for kids.Finally, this is a very posable figure. It'll easily stand securely upright, even in odd poses. The articulation and balance are excellent.All I can really criticize is the nasty green color and the looseness of the roof rack attachment. There's also the blocky ""preschool toy"" feel of the design, but that's part of what I think makes it so durable and suited for kids. But those are minor points."
3,Too advanced for young children,"I bought this for my six year old thinking that he would be able to transform it himself since it's rated for ages 5 and up but it's not easy. It took me a while to figure it out using the practically useless directions that it comes with. My sixteen year old has to transform it for him all the time, how much fun is that? Also, there's pieces that pop off too easily and makes it difficult to transform."
4,Lack of structure problems seem resolved,"This seems like a very nice bag, but I haven't used it yet in actual travel. The criticisms of previous reviews, that the bag lacks structure and flops unattractively, have seemingly been addressed by the addition of a lightweight and flexible piece of foam backing sewn into the larger section of the bag that will keep it upright without being packed full. The bag is designed to look like a book bag or other not-handbag so as not to attract thieves. It looks like it will hold a lot and it is very lightweight."
3,CIVITA SHOULDER BAG,VERY ROOMY. SOFT FABRIC. DOESN'T HOLD SHAPE WHEN FILLED.HANGS LIMPLY --- WHICH IS UNATTRACTIVE.
1,What a drag....,"I was so excited to see a DVD by the fabulously witty and crazy Mary Jo McGraw...I snapped it right up and was really looking forward to some of MJM's signature style and fun. Unfortunately, this is the most boring thing I've ever owned. MJM speaks in a slow monotonous monotone that just makes me cringe...I even tried fast forward without sound and the thing still just drags...you can't speed this thing up enough to make it interesting. The techniques are very basic and not at all advanced or interesting. My opinion? Skip this DVD and see MJM in person. None of her character shines through in this DVD."
4,Life Saver,I bought this for my Instep Safari Double Jogger when we went to Disneyland. It worked great ... our last day at the park it rained pretty hard and this cover kept both kids dry! Great deal for the price!
4,Works great for price,"Okay, it tore the 3rd time I used it because-my toddler kicked at it-it was SUPER windy-the Velcro on the bottom part was barely sewn onI did as another review suggested and sewed reinforcements, making the straps longer on the side my toddler sits on so he can kick or peek his head out without the attachment ripping. Ended up sewing ties onto top attachments as Velcro tends to come apart...I think it would be fine as-is if you had it on a double stroller with two gentle kids and didn't go out in windy weather.Works okay for a cheap no brand cover... But if you can sew it becomes great!!!Also as others said it is pretty oderous straight out of the box."
3,"works okay, not best quality","There are no instructions or diagrams that come with this to show you where all the velcro is supposed to attach, so it possible my husband and i simply cant figure it out, but if not then this cover does not even semi securely cover the stroller as I was made to believe. Also the quality wont be expected to last very long... part of one of the seams tore as I was opening the package. I bought this when I bought our double jogger, the Schwinn Turismo remote Swivel Jogging Stroller, and it doesnt fit quite right but we are keeping it because we dont have a garage and need to keep the stroller out of the rain."
3,What are the dimensions?,"Can anyone tell me what the dimensions are? I don't know if it will fit my big double stroller. I have an old school ""Baby Jogger"" that's pretty big."
4,"Yep, a cheapo rain cover.","And yep, it smells. But, it's cheap and the smell will go away. Paid $15 and it was worth it."
2,"it' ok, but.....","So it would work just fine. However if you have a 19 month old sitting in the stroller that gives the whole thing a good kick, the two strapes on the bottom pop right of the cover and make it useless.Edit, even though the two straps had popped off way to easily I have managed to fix it and make it even better. Just attach some velcro to the parts of the stroller and the parts of the cover that you want to connect. A bit of extra work, but really worth the time and the effort."
4,better than expected,"We bought this for our double Baby Jogger City Mini. It fits just fine. We have not experienced a terribly heavy rainstorm, but did the job in a light rain. It is compact and easy to have with you. I can see where in heavier rain, or larger kids their feet might get wet. Overall great product for the price."
4,Pleased,"The cover fits fairly well for our Instep double jogging stroller, just a little big. I didn't find the odor to be too strong at all, was able to use it the day after receiving it."
1,Completely dissatisfied,It hardly fits our double stroller. And one of the cheap clasps to secure it down broke on the first use. It was a huge waste of money!
2,thin cheap plastic tears,"okay for the price, but we have to keep taping it up as it tears constantly in different spots...have another one for a single jogger that we bought a few years back that is slightly thicker plastic, and never tore."
1,Awful!,"I bought this rain cover for my Bob Revolution double jogger. It doesn't fit the Bob at all, don't even try. I say the product is awful, though, because it ripped as I was taking it out of the package. It ripped along one seam so I figured I would still try it thinking I could tape it or something. As I tried to get it over the stroller it ripped again in several more places. Granted, it doesn't fit the Bob, and that is why I would expect it to rip if I was trying to force it on to make it fit. But I was being extra careful since it ripped as I was taking it out of the package. I sent it back. Pay the extra money and get the cover made for your specific stroller. I learned my lesson trying to be cheap."
5,The best NDI album . . . so far,I've been a fan of these guys for a long time and this is their finest album to date. It comes the closest to capturing their live energy and humor. If you're new to NDI get this album. Their sound is sorta like power pop meets old country meets heavy metal. Truely magnificent.
1,Buyer beware!!!!!,"OK, nowhere on the description of this product does it say ""PS/2"", but it is. Don't be like me and assume that since this is the 21st century that PS/2 items no longer sell. I was pretty hacked off when I opened the box and the packing slip said ""PS/2"" and the cable reflected the same. GRRRRRRRRRR! Don't know who's fault this is, but they should be repremanded."
5,"Beenu's ""Majesty""","This necklace is gorgeous. Some of the emeralds had inclusions (tiny dots visible inside the stone) ranging from minor to major. It is difficult, though, to find a completely flawless emerald, especially at this price. The inclusions are part of the formation of the emerald and give the stone character. The blue topaz stones are brilliant, and the zircons add a defining sparkle. The chain that the pendant comes with is made of thick, bright silver. This necklace is a unique piece; one that I am proud to own."
5,Necessary for Shin Buddhism Studies!,"This book is one of the classics for Teaching of Shin buddhism.I felt that it had a bit of modernization to it, possibly due to translation Etc... and with the mention of Science and Metaphysics, even Voltaire which you don't hear about very often in a Shin guide.I found it quick and to the point but it did skip around too much for my small one track mind."
1,The Pure Land is NOT here and now!,"Although D.T. Suzuki is an authority on Zen Buddhism, he is way off the mark when discussing Jodo Shinshu. Specifically when he claims the Pure land is ""here and now"", which is not mentioned in the Pure Land sutras, or anything by the Pure Land patriarchs, especially Masters Honen, Shinran, and Rennyo. This is a ZEN concept, not a SHIN one. This is but just one of the modernist divergences that plague the Shin community today, that if it had happened in the 13th century would have earned it a place in the Tannisho. Not to mention the claims of modernists that Amida is a myth, or the Pure Land is not a real place. The Dharma Masters of the Shin tradition never said that.I cannot recommend this book as an introduction to Shin at all. You would be better off reading the letters of Master Rennyo, and the books by Eiken Kobai Sensai."
3,less than expected from a master like daisetz,"this book is way to short and daisetz jumps from one subject to the next way to fast. Although he does a good job of explaining the various points of Shinto, you'll fell as though he could have done better. If you want a good book by Daisetz I'd suggest ""Zen Buddhism: selected writings of D.T.Susuki""."
1,"How to build and modify Ford 60 degree V6""s","Hurry up and send my copy so i can write a review , it's been three weeks since i've ordered it and if it doesnt show up by the date promised i will never order online again. does anybody hear me, or is my money the only concern and delivery takes a back seat......"
2,Details are very lacking........ Sad.,"Read the book this week and the inaccuracy of the details reveal a basic lack of understanding of the American Military. These flaws make an otherwise ""OK"" book plotwise almost painful to read. I think Mr. Sutherland wrote the book to reflect a British Officer and some publishing wizard (rolleyes) convinced him to re-write it was an eye towards the American market. If more (any?) research was conducted, this would be a decent read. If accuracy isn't an issue with the reader get it. If having F16s become carrier borne and officers hopping on and off active duty while working at West Point as a ""Weapons Instructor"" isn't a bother, enjoy."
2,i have to give up when the story became so contrite,"this novel looked so promising at first, then it became like a dog chasing his own tail, round and round, and going nowhere. i don't know, maybe this author is a foreigner and has tried to write a book about america and americans, about army, arms sales, covert operation, u.s. customs, i.r.s., etc., etc., but he seemed to get too deep while trying very hard not to be too shallow. the tempo is too slow to call it a thriller, except ""ned"" suddenly awoke in the mid night, found one of the window shades fluffed and thought there was somebody in the house...then some car started not far away....that's thriller, but what else we got?i lost my patience....this author's english writing is very good, besides that, i really don't know what else we got here."
2,IM VERY DISSAPOINTED,"ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME PREFER THIS PRODUCT OVER THE OTHERS, WAS THE FACT THAT IT SAYS THAT IT HAD SD MEMORY SLOT, AND IT WASNT TRUE, BESIDES THAT, IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS, THE SCREEN FAILS AND IS NOT WORKING."
1,Beware of poor quality,"We purchased this pool in August of last year and used it for about a month until the season ended and it became too cold to swim. I drained and dried the pool and then stored it according to the instructions. When I was filling it for the upcoming season, it filled to about 3/4 full and then a seam split from top to bottom. After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, I finally reached customer service and was told that they will not honor any warranty past 90 days from purchase, regardless of the fact that it was obviously defective. The cost that they quoted for a replacement liner is more than I originally paid for the whole setup. This appears to be a common problem and I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"Perfect for the younger kids, look elsewhere for a family movie","If you're looking for a movie that the entire family will enjoy you're probably better going with a tried and true favorite like Homeward Bound. The storyline and dialogue in this movie are very simplistic and will quickly bore older viewers.That being said, this movie will be a hit with young children that like animals. My two year old daughter has had this movie a week and has asked to watch it every day. It can be helpful for introducing new animals to a young child's vocabulary and is a great way to talk about obedience with your child- since this pup's disobedience and knack for not following direction tends to get him in trouble a lot."
4,Fun Movie!,"Nice clean movie to enjoy with children! We watched it as a family with young children, and everyone liked it."
4,Good family movie,Clean movie that is good for the entire family. Good for our younger kids who are 3 and 6. Animals kept their interest.
3,Good for little kids,"It wasn't the most stimulating movie, but it was great for our 2 1/2 year old. It was very simple and innocent, I didn't have to worry about explaining anything to her or worry that she might repeat anything inappropriate from it."
2,Its Ok,My three year old loves this movie because of the animals. My husband however where bored to kingdom come and back. Was so boreing. I give it two stars because my littl egirl enjoyed it.
2,black screen lock-ups,"My 7 year old son absolutely LOVES this game. Unfortunately, he will be playing just fine one minute, then he gets a black screen and the computer locks up. Very frustrating! I suggested we take it back and get the Nintendo version, but he really wants to play this on the computer. The Nintendo reviews don't look much better! (At least there are no lockups) The camera angle seems awkward to me, but it doesn't seem to bother my son."
5,Get the walkthrough,"We got this game for our son a few years and computers ago. He is now almost 9 and has a laptop with XP and still plays it.I highly recommend googling for the walkthrough found online. I don't see how we could have completed the game without it.Also, while the game was extremely challenging for our son and even for us as we tried to assist him (hubby and I were never able to climb all the way up the tree), with practice our 8-year-old is now able to get to all the places with no problem.Yes, the look is dated, but the music is great! We love this game."
3,"for fans of ""rocket from the crypt""",not a bad cd but not amazing either. if you are into RFTC or hot snakes you'll probably like this cd.
1,Total Waste of money,"Don't buy this junk! Nice covers but, they have nothing to do with the stuff inside..."
1,Why?,"This item was bought as a prank gift for a friend, and hereturned it to me because it was so bad. Don't even waist your timeon this ""deal."""
5,Excellent resource!,This book is an excellent resource for children! I find it very helpful and descriptive....worth it!
4,Love the Guys,I love Miami Vice but it seems as if each season became worse and finally in season five it was time to call it a day! Season One is priceless but nothing else compared to it! I gave it four stars because I love the guys and love them as partners... I love the cast but the plots were just strange at times!
5,Great Season,"Another great season of Vice. Darker clothes and music throughout, overall a much darker, more serious season. Did anybody else notice the the Daytona was back somehow in the episode ""El Viejo""?"
5,Miami Vice Season Three,No problems with this product...Its funny to see all the stars that were just beginning in the 80s that are now big time stars
4,Great Show,"Season 1-3 of Vice were my favorites and after buying Season 1 and 2, 3 was the natural next purchase."
4,Miami Vice -Season 3,I purchased this as a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas. He obviously likes the series as he has the first two.
3,Red Hot Rumble Is a bit of a fizzle,"The Viewtiful joe Games are just about as good as they come. Inventive, fast, cool action, cool graphics. They are the poster child for better games without better graphics. Unfortunately this game does not include most of that. Part of the charm of the VJ series is the cool little puzzles all the way through. This game has none of them. When you actually try to replicate the fun of super smash brothers and have four fighters at once. Forget it. You can hardly understand what is happening on the screen. The single player is decent, but that is about it."
5,WOW,"I to heard of the book from the Montel Williams show and all I can say is WOW. The book was extremely well written. I was very interested in the trial part of the book. I didn't think it would turn out how it did. It's hard to imagine something like that actually happening in real life, but this is proof that it does happen."
4,it could use some more detail...,"but, the details that were shared in this book were damaging enough. this book gives u just a taste of the deviants this man && his friends actually were, w/o permanantly scarring u for life. i've yet to finish this book because of the torture he put these women through, but i still say it's worth the read. if u thought dahmer was evil, u have no idea. the writing is decent. the quotes @ the beginning of each chapter were impressive. this book was given to me by my mother, so i can't comment on if it was worth my money. but, if i had to, my personal opinion would be to buy it used, just in case u're too sensitive to make it all the way to the end."
3,Horrifying facts + One of the sickest stories of serial killers I've read. + Dry and boring story telling = 3 stars,"- This book contains 8 pages of photos of the killer, his accomplices, his victims, and his torture tools. Besides, they show his residence, the judge, the attorneys and the prosecutor.- It also consists of horrifying facts. For example in chapter 12, the tape recorded by the killer explained to his victims what he's going to do to her body. It's more spine-chilling than a Hitchcock movie. It's one of the sickest stories of serial killers I've read. Now I truly understand what monster means.- The writing is dry and boring.- In short, it's still worth reading because the unique story."
2,Ramblings of the Insignificant,"This book is filled with insignificant information from insignificant sources. The author apparently couldn't find enough fact to complete a whole novel on David Ray Parker and his group of followers or chose rather to fill the book with as much sensationalism as possible. He gives voice to people that have nothing to do with the case. There was little to no investigative journalism here. That being said, this book did manage to give a horrific glimpse into a gruesome world. It also managed to enlighten the reader about the level of difficulty in proving someone guilty in court. As well, the book demonstrated the predator's level of intelligence and acuity for research prior to and during his period of violence. The victims were those castaways of society that few care about. Thus, if the reader is willing to wind through all the other disengenous nonsense, she will percieve the true identity of a serial sadist."
3,very disturbing!!!!,"The thing is that is really sucks that this is a true story. Women get kidnapped and sexually tortured, raped and sodmized by this sick man who lives in the desert.The details are graphic and it made me sick to my stomach ot read, it affects women obviously more than men. But if you are into reading true crime novels, it's very descriptive and the writer did a well job.."
1,Not Good,"Although I saw that Mr. Fielder had put a lot of information in this book, I thought it was a very poorly written, and subsequently published, book. There were so many typos, that I wondered if anyone had even bothered to proof-read the book. The printing was crooked and offset. The content of the book seemed to be out of place. I got the feeling that other than simply writing down everything he had found out, Mr. Fielder put little effort in insuring that his book was of a high, or even moderate standard. Had I known this all beforehand, I may not have purchased the book."
1,I'm through with the true crime genre !!,"This book was well written. However, after reading it, I can no longer read true crime books. I always donate my books to the library but had to throw this one in the garbage so no one else would read it. The acts of Ray are so unspeakably horror-filled that he makes the circumcision of women in Iran look like nothing. What he did was so very sick that he should have been put down like an animal. I have never read about such a sick man in my life and I've been reading true crime for 45 years. If you like sadism, torture and the total pain of women, psychologically and physically, this book is for you. Otherwise, I advise everyone out there reading this review: Don't read this book. The content will make you shiver and puke. No normal person could read this book and enjoy it. I am sworn off true crime forever now."
2,Boring,"I first heard of this book when two of the victims were on the Montel Williams show. I could not wait to get the book. I was very disappointed in it. I really did not learn much that was not on Montel. I thought most of it was boring and I day dreamed through much of it. I would love to know more about Ray and what he did, and less about the prosecutor, ect."
3,I read this and lived this,I lived in T or C at the time and knew almost everyone involved and still didn't know the whole story. when I read what was in this book I was taken aback by some of the facts I didn't know anything about.
1,Agreement with David Group,"I bought this book in the ramsj for 1.25 (=$1) and it is hopeless. In the second half scenes and time switch every five sentences and the misery, in the writing and in the plot, is almost unbearable. Curing by mantra's and a lot of esoteric nonsense. I think I've paid too much."
5,Great Choice!,I printed multiple items for my son's birthday party that could not be purchased in stores. The printouts were colorful and the software was easy to use.
5,Amazon Came Through,"I found this book (God's Blessings Story Bible) in a Christian book store and wanted to give it as a gift; however, the cover was damaged. They tried to order it for me but found it was out of print and suggested I try you. Low and behold, it was available through your website, I got the book, and it was in perfect condition. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
5,Buy this album!,"I was a little hesitant to buy this at first. I had ""The World's Room"" and thought it was pretty good. When I saw this, I thought I'd try it, but wasn't expecting too much. Wow, was I wrong. Any band worth its salt is better live than studio recorded, and these guys blew me away. Tracks 1, 6, 8, and 10 are the truly great. The crowd adds another dimension to the performance. Any good Celtic band makes crowd feel like they're contributing to the concert, and from the way the crowd reacts in this one, they're having a good time. You'll want to hang the guy with the whistle by the end, but you'll also be singing along the whole time."
4,Third Experience with Old Blind Dogs,"I was introduced to Old Blind Dogs through a National Public Radio interview, and found the music upbeat, meaningful to the culture, and enjoyed the Scottish blend, as it is so different from the popular music here in America. I looked them up on the web and requested ""Fit?"" for my birthday, but got this album instead. I am glad I did. Unfortunately, I am trying to contact someone via e-mail for possible help with the lyrics, since I can't quite understand the Scottish colloquilisms, and there are none in the liner of this album. But I am really enjoying it at the moment even if I can't understand all the words! I would rate this CD 4.5, but that's not an option. Good job OBDs!"
2,Not worth the $$,"My daughter begged for this toy for Xmas 2 yrs ago and of course Santa gave it to her. She played with it twice - the day she got it and the next day. It just collects dust. She's not that much into imaginative play, though, so if your kid is, it may be a better toy for them."
3,Too Small,"While there are a variety of patterns in this book, it claims the patterns are conveniently sized and ready for use. The patterns ar a little too small to use directly from the book. They need to be taken to a printer and enlarged slightly unless you want to be cutting pieces of glass so tiny they will be impossible to hold onto when assembling the project or grinding them. This is not to say all of the patterns are this way. Some of them are fine, but most are not."
5,Great little mouse at a great price.,Companion purchase to the pink mouse (my wife's choice!) ... powered with internal light from the USB connector ... plug-n-play compatible. Works fine with my deskdop XP and replaced the worn out HP mouse.
3,ok la,it is not my cup of tea .someone will like this .but it isnt the product problem .it 's my problem
4,Love it!,I love this conditioner for my 2 dogs but the photo is not the size that arrived. It looks like the photo is of a gallon container. I would of given 5 stars except for the deceptive photo.
2,Just anwers for the Commodity Trading Manual,This workbook contents only the anwers for the questions inside the Manual. The questions are just text interpretation and don't represent nothing than a method of study. I don't think that it is useful for people that want to understand the markets and need case studies.
4,luv it,"This is such a great anime!!!Beautiful music,art,story.Only reason I took a star off is because I prefer the Japanese audio to the English audio.When watching it in english I hate being distracted by the ridiculous voice cast they chose.Want a better experience?Watch it in Japanese with english subtitles."
1,omg thats so stupid!,"Ok thats like the most stupidest thing to do! release all of DNAngel complete boxset in DUBBED format only? what about the subbed format for those of us that prefer the original Japanese audio? This is a very stupid move on ADV's part to not release the boxset in dual audio -_- i can honestly say that THIS boxset wont be on my ""to buy"" list thanks alot ADV for making a very stupid mistake"
4,One of the best anime ever!,"I got to admit that Amazon overpriced this item, but you wont tegret buying this item. This anime is about a boy named Daisuke Niwa who is has a special gene condition that whenever he sees this crush, Risa Harada, he turns into a famous phantom thief Dark Mousy. It is a rare magical boy anime & one of my favorite anime ever! I only rated it 4 stars because it is overpriced. But trust me, once you buy this item, you would want to watch it over & over again."
4,"Good, but too expensive online","I borrowed this anime from a friend, and while I enjoyed it, I would not spend $80+ on something I could pick up at Best Buy for $50."
4,Awesome anime!,"Normally I prefer action-packed anime, but my friend had me watch this. After 1 episode (I had NO idea what was going on) I was in love with this anime, so I bought the complete collection! I highly suggest this, D.N. Angel is one of the best animes to watch!Postives: Nice work, good storyline, fun to watchNegative(s): Some episodes got off topic, and strayed away from the whole thief purpose of the anime."
5,Untouchable,"From the ashes of the dying genre of Trance, and the smoldering embers of House emerged a new genre: Breaks. Pioneered by artists like Orbital, Leftfield, and Fluke, there is an entirely new crop of artists spearheading the movement today. Hyper is one of these people. He has an unnerving talent of creating a completely moving, tasteful, and ridiculously awesome set almost seamlessly. From dancefloor stormers, to more laid-back tracks, this CD is THE breaks CD to own in 2003"
2,Not a new standard,"It is nice to hear these works recorded yet again, but Banaszak hardly sets a new standard for these works or for the saxophone in general. Those believing so haven't listened to enough players or recordings. Banaszak is either extremely overbalanced (by a marginal orchestra) or prefers to hide in an unrevealing--and unflattering--recording mix. The soloist and orchestra exhibit questionable intonation, and any profound interpretation that may be present is lost in muddled, directionless playing. The 'standard' has been redefined by so many other players that I have to disagree with the other reviews. Still, Banaszak must be commended for recording these pieces which all saxophonists know so well."
2,One to skip,"Greg Banaszak certainly has the technically ability required of a classical saxophonist, but his interpretations are flat, emotionless, colorless, and ultimately boring. Especially disappointing is the Rachmaninoff, which Banaszak succeeds in completely butchering with his thin tone and painful vibrato. The Glazounov is acceptable, but still suffers from overdone vibrato. The first and third movements of the Ibert are okay, but the second movement, one of the most beautiful and lyric compositions in the saxophone repertoire, becomes a clumsy and boring jumble of drawn-out long notes. I would not recommend this album to anyone who is learning to play the pieces performed on this album (that was the reason for my purchase of the CD). There are many other recordings of these compositions which would be more useful to a saxophonist, and more enjoyable to the casual listener."
4,REQUIRED READING FOR YOUR TEENAGE SON,"Good book...well written with illustrations and examples of manly comportment. References to men of our past to emulate. This will offend certain ""guys"", particularily men who dance and sing while wearing lavander colors and/or eating designer pastries! Readers of this book often stockpile guns and ammo, just in case!"
3,Helpful and interesting. 3-stars...but I'm hard to please...,"A good selection of readings with all sorts different authors. Putnam, James, Rorty, Dewy and West--just to name a few. The selections are interesting and varied enough to give the beginner to pragmatism an interesting first or second taste. For those that are more familiar with pragmatism, this gives a selection of authors that one may not be familiar with (be they contemporaries like Putnam or one of the originators like Dewey). Pragmatism apart from being (arguably) ""true"" (and any pragmatist should understand the scare quotes) is also a whole lot of fun!! An anthology with variety and short-ish readings is doubly so. Also, the introduction I think, is to be commended. It's pretty good and would be worth reading apart from this collection."
4,Great cupcakes!,I have made a couple of things from this book and the recipes have worked out well. I make the cupcakes often and get lots of compliments for them. I find all the recipes have far too much sugar in them though (perhaps this is an American thing for over-sweet cakes?) so I just reduce the sugar and they still work out fine.
5,Wonderful,"I have made several of the cakes, frostings and the brownies from this cookbook. I found the recipes very easy to follow and the results were better than local bakeries. It is important to remember that baking is like chemistry. The recipes I made were huge success with my family and friends."
1,A bit off,"Every recipe I've tried has been a little off. I'm not an expert baker, but it almost tastes like a lot of these recipes call for too much flour, or maybe the ingredient proportions are just off. Everything ends up with a ""powdery"" flour taste and texture. So far, I've made a few cakes and a batch of blondies. All were below average, in my opinion. The icing mixes were ok, though. I won't be trying anything else from this book. Luckily it was a gift so I didn't spend money on it."
2,So Disappointed!,"I had heard the buzz about the Magnolia Bakery and was very excited to try the recipes in this cookbook. I made a few of the recipes, and they just don't seem to come out quite right. I have been an avid baker for over ten years, and I don't have trouble following recipes. For example, I tried the blackout cake, but it just didn't knock my socks off. It was a very average chocolate cake. The vanilla cupcakes were similarly bland. Even without all of the hype surrounding the Magnolia Bakery, I still would have been disappointed with this book."
5,Perfect recipes for delicious goodies,This cookbook has some wonderfully basic recipes that will be at the top of your list when looking for something really good to bake. My daughter has this and had baked the white birthday cake out of it for my granddaughter's birthday. It was so moist and really excellent. We use it for all birthday celebrations now. One doesn't feel special if any other cake is presented! The recipes are not difficult but the results taste like you have slaved for hours. This is a sure winner and I guarantee it will make you look great in the eyes of those you cook for.
4,Easy to understand,"Thoguh others might not feel this way, this book is easy to understand and to follow through. I felt taht the end result was just and they are in the actual bakery. I feel this is a good book for anyone starting out in baking or a more advanced baker."
5,Great Book on Baking,"The book was in perfect shape..just like new. Good price. Great recipes.Thanks, gb"
5,delicous,This was the best cookbook in the store. i think that jennifer appel is a baking genius.i loved it so much i bought it as a gift for christmas for my girlfriend.she wants to marry me because i got it for her.thank you jennifer appel.
4,Magnolia Vs. Buttercup,"Most cake-loving New Yorkers know that Jennifer Appell co-founded Magnolia then left to found Buttercup Bake Shop, but beware. As is usually the case, the sequel never matches the caliber of the original.The Magnolia bakery and cookbook are true delights to any sweets lovers! Buttercup, on the other hand, features dry cakes with mounds of crusty icing, and the recipe book is filled with some real head scratchers (12 tbsp. of Crisco to top a coffee cake? Trust me, it's terrible!)If you can't decide between the Magnolia or Buttercup cookbooks, go for the original Magnolia recipes!There are 2 things I couldn't put down. This book and my cup of S o y f e e. It's made from organic soyabeans which you brew just like coffee. No caffeine and I don't miss it either. Look for on the web at www. S oycoffee.com.Great book. I promise you won't be disappointed!!"
3,nice pics!,These are great books especially for kids to look at the pics.Not much new in the recipes but very nicely done.sharyn whiting
4,Yo! I told you that I'm crazy for these cupcakes cousin!,"""Then let's hit up Magnolia, and mack on some cupcakes!No doubt that bakery's got all the raw frosting.I love those cupcakes like McAdam loves GoslingTwo!No, six!No, twelve!Baker's Dozen!I told you that I'm crazy for these cupcakes cousin!""I think that says it all. Delicious!"
2,Still waiting to get a hit,"After reading all the rave reiviews this cookbook got, I couldn't wait to start baking. Boy was I disappointed with the first two recipes I tried. The Chocolate Buttermilk Layer Cake was not sweet enough and very dry. The Strawberry Oat Bars were very bland (needed more sugar in pastry) and the baking time needed to be doubled for crust and crumb topping. I'll give it one more shot..."
2,"Okay, but I was expecting more",VERY basic recipes in this one. I was expecting more based on Magnolia's reputation. Disappointing...
4,It's an attractive cookbook,"I've made several recipes out of my Magnolia Bakery Cookbook and I'd say that I was happy with about half of them. I honestly think that is pretty good odds for a cookbook though. It all comes down to opinion, because some of the recipes that I've not cared for, other people have absolutely loved the results. I'm really attracted to the book's presentation - I think that it looks lovely. I also purchased the Buttercup Bakery cookbook and find that one to be about the same quality. As for the Magnolia cookbook, I think that it is a bit expensive for the size of it but I collect baking cookbooks and I wanted this one to add to my collection no matter what the price. I think it makes an attractive gift and I think that it's fine for baking beginners. The recipes are simple and made with basic ingredients. Plus, it's different than those massively printed cookbooks that everyone owns - that's a nice change."
2,Test these recipes first,"I must agree with others who found that the recipes simply do not work. I have been baking for over 30 years and have had great success with other cookbooks, but the recipes I have tried in this book are *complete disasters*. The cakes and cupcakes come out flat and dry. The icing recipes are very sweet and make very large amounts. I would caution cooks too not use these recipes for special occassions, bake sales, etc. unless you have first tried the recipes so you can make adjustments. In all fairness, it seems to be a problem caused by adjusting recipes to smaller batches coupled with insufficient testing. My supermarket flour and home oven have worked fine with baking recipes from many other chefs."
4,Great Cakes,I have tried several recipes from this book and can't wait to try more. My family is asking when I will bake another coconut or german chocolate cake. It is great to have old fashion recipes that taste like my grandmother cooked.It is very important to follow the instructions exactly for the recipes to turn out right. Hope you enjoy this book as much as I am.
5,Simply Delicious!!!,Makes you want to go to New York - and taste the real thing - the recipes are that good!!! Either buy the book - or stop in the bakery - or better yet - do both!!!
2,"as another reviewer has noted, I found the receipes did not","I have tried to make three of the magnolia receipes and so faronly one has been almost passable. I am quite disappointed, as I have followed many cake receipes and have usually had success with them. All I can think is that the instructions are poor."
3,Good but not the same as the real Magnolia,"I bought this bakebook for the vanilla cupcakes with vanilla icing, just as they sell at Magnolia. Everytime I'm in the city I like to stop at Magnolia (or my new recent favorite cupcake eatery Buttercup)and eat a delicious treat. However, these cupcakes are definitely not the ""real deal."" The recipes require tweaking. The cupcakes are too dry when made according to recipe. The icing, had I used all of the sugar the recipe called for, would be cavity rot on a cupcake. I used 1/2 the sugar that the recipe called for and found that to be the perfect amount for the perfect icing. For these reasons, I am giving it 3 stars. It's good, but not quite perfect."
2,Pretty to look at....,Have many cookbooks displayed in my kitchen - but looked forward to this one because of the reputation of the bakery and the hype surrounding the book. Not impressed - I'm a long time baker and found nothing new here. Most of these recipes can be found in your average cookbook. Much ado about not a lot.
3,A Mystery,"I have tried making the recipe for yellow cupcakes (what I assumed they made in their shop here in NYC) and everytime I make them they are tasty but come out like dense little poundcakes, not as fluffy as they could be. Anyone else have this problem?"
3,Not For Beginners,"Before embarking on my own review of this book I read through the others, and I must agree with several of the not too pleased reviews. This book is filled with wonderful goodies to make, however, I did note a few typos in the book. The authors or the publishers fault? Who's to say, but this book is definately not a Baking 101 book.If you know your way around the kitchen and a cookbook, you can get through it okay. I have made several of the recipes (I have baking experience) and I must say, they can be hit or miss. I must also must agree with one reviewer: the oatmeal cookies were awful. But, several others (including the chocolate cake, cheesecakes, and magic cookie bars) were wonderful!Yes, if these authors write another cookbook I will check it out. Hope this review helped."
2,a reader from maine,"I had high hopes for this book, but was disappointed. The blueberry muffins were terrible.The recipe called for three cups of flour, which I thought seemed like quite alot. The muffins tasted bland, like cooked flour. Maybe it's a misprint. I also made the butterscotch cheesecake brownies. They were very sweet, overdone at the edge and underdone in the center. I consider myself a skilled baker, and the directions were clear. I was not happy with the results."
5,Died and went to heaven,"These recipes are amazing. Not too hard to follow and they've all turned out great (so far). I'm not one to stray from the recipe, so I'm usually hopefull at the outcome, and so far I've not been disappointed. There are some fantastic treats in here and you don't have to be a professional pastry chef to accomplish what's inside. Buy this, and keep the whole family happy (and full)."
5,"Wonderfully moving and heartfelt, makes you long for more!","I loved this book. I've read it 3 times. I don't have enough words to describe the passion this story evokes in me. Full of magick of the rawest kind, and just enough danger to keep your blood pumping. When I read this book I long to live at Constance Colliers witch village. Oh, if only there was such a place!! This is a great work of art."
2,Great sandals...but couldn't replace for same price,"I purchased this pair of sandals for one of our grandchildren and I really like the design and construction. But, I had to return them because they were too short on his feet. I used the Amazon sizing guide to purchase the sandals, but there was no room in the toe area when he put them on. The price was great when I purchased them, but by the time I mailed them, which was right away, the price had increased to over double the purchase price! So, I chose another brand of sandal to buy instead. I would definitely buy the Stride Rite sandal again, but only at the reduced price."
2,I would say that these are not Stride Rite...,"This seems not to be a Stride Rite shoe, although in fact it is. I have switched from ECCO to Stride Rite XW since I found out that my son has extremely wide feet. The first models of Stride Rite Toddler Tech I purchased were of equal ergonomics and overall quality than ECCO. In other words, the load of body's weight should be applied to certain sectors of the sole, so that the whole body stands upright correctly after some time of use. These ANGLER however, do not have that ergonomic design characteristic of ECCO and best versions of Stride Rite. Additionally, the ''XW'' version of these ANGLER looks rather like a ''W''. The ANGLER looks like no different as the whole of Chinese shoes on the market, but worth as a Stride Rite. Never again for me!"
3,"Nice collection for price, compromised audio","This review is about the video/audio transfer for this package, not the movies themselves.Nice collection for the price, which I paid under $10.00. The positive is that the Halloween flicks are anamorphic widescreen. The (very) bad: audio is NOT Dolby Digital 5.1. Worse, H20 and Resurrection audio is not even 2 channel stereo but downmixed to monophonic. I have other similarly packaged DVD's like this at similar price points with both the widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 multi-channel intact so I don't why Miramax (or is it Echo Bridge Entertainment) choose to do this. Probably because they know most consummers won't care (??). Anyway, I do care and will go purchase the three halloween movies in their own packages to get the full film experience.Because of the value for 4 movies in one package I would give this about a 3 1/2 rating. The dings are for the severe compromised audio track transfer."
2,Interviewees show up as less than credible,"Bummer...would love to hear and see the truth about UFOs in real time rather than 20, 30, 40, 50 years later. The topic is controversial already...why create badly produced movies...no help what so ever."
3,Fastwalkers Kindle Video,"This video didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. I'm surprised it didn't mention the Coast to Coast radio program, which is possibly the largest forum for contactees in the world. It did offer some good UFO photos and videos, but I suspect the vidos were computer generated. Very few real experiencers were interviewed. Then (surprise!) I saw the date on the movie was several years old."
1,Ultimately reductive,"Reasons for and solutions to addiction cannot yet be numbered. For a professional to suggest that the answer is to have 'courage' is reductive and judgmental. Those people that have the courage to leap from tall buildings in an attempt to end their nightmare have more courage than I do, and more than the good doctor has ever had need to summon, I'm sure. We do not yet have the answer to this question and in the meantime AA does a sterling job for some. The rest of us are still seeking. For me, Dr Schaler does not have the answer."
4,Great little mouse,"I really like this mouse. Much lighter than the average optical mouse, making for less strain on the wrists. Nice responsiveness. If only these mice came standard with computers/optional with laptops..."
2,Save yourself the trouble,"My Setup:4 x Dell 4700's/Radeon x3002 x Dell 5150's/Radeon x3002 of 4 Dell 4700's would work fine, the monitor would never come back after switching. So I bought 2 new Dell 5150's thinking they would work. Plugged them in and after switching back and forth the Dell 19"" Ultrasharp 1905 would not restore. I tried a different monitor with the same results.Contacted their support 3 times and they were miffed and had no answers.Needless to say I bought an AVOCENT SWITCHVIEW 4-PORT DVI USB KVM SWITCH USB 2.0 HUB W/AUDIOWorked flawless."
2,"Great idea, but doesn't live up to product description","The box has great potential, however, I was surprised to find that ANY analog display equipment will not work. From the product web page on iogear's site I see it supports ""DVI digital and analog monitor support."" However, I've tried several video adapters and talked to iogear technical support on several occasions who assures me it should work fine but can offer me no clues as to why it doesn't. My attempts to talk with second level support were met with a variety of creative excuses.I would only buy this KVM switch if you don't have ANY legacy equipment. In other words don't use it with computers that have analog displays or PS2 devices. If you're in that position, I envy you."
5,"Works great, straight out of the box",I was worried this might not work with my setup but had no problems running at 1920x1200! My setup is:Thinkpad T42AMD/Asus A8N-E (nforce 4 ultra)
2,Needs Better sound/usd sharing support,"Works well to share one DVI monitor/ Keyboard and Mouse. USB, Speaker and Microphone Sharing just does not work."
5,Working Great in our Professional Application,"This product, in conjunction with a pair of DVI EDID identification spoofers, is working GREAT in one of our UAV Ground Station applications.Excellent High Quality Product - I am proud to be using it... now, if they can come up with a 19"" Rack Mount Kit, I'll be completely set."
4,A great tale of World War II,"I could barely put this book down. It was a reviting story from the first page to the last.The author also did not get into the ""I'm so great"" attitude that so many people do. Fighter pilots seem espcially prone to this idea.It was also written in a nice simple matter that takes the time to explain what was going on for those who are not familair with the Second World War.It is a great first person account of the air war in the Pacific."
2,"Good, but not great.","One quote from the book seems to flavor the rest of the book. ""I no longer have the figures, but the training hours outnumbered the combat hours by several hundred to one, and the balance kept shifting farther and farther toward the training hours."" In fact much of the book is training. While he seems a very decent person, and would be interesting to meet, he was not in the thick of much of the fighting. He probably saved a large number of more raw recruits as he was a training officer and gave his extensive training knowledge to others, but it does not make a great combat narrative.Also, while there are some interesting parts about the plane, there is really very little detail about how night fighting developed, or why. Some surmises, but no real look at the details.This is a personal account, and while interesting, don't mistake this for a lengthy combat descriptor."
5,"In a room full of people, Nancy sang only to me!","It's true -- the first time I saw and heard Nancy was in San Francisco at the Plush Room. We happened to sit at a front table and when Nancy started singing -- everyone else disappeared. After the show, she came out from behind the curtain and came directly to our table. I knew then that I would always be enthralled with her unique, touching, and often fun ways with her music. We've since bought several of her albums -- we've given this 'Beautiful Baby' to friends... I think this is the best of all of her CDs -- but I enjoy all of her offerings. She's not with us any more -- but even today -- she seems to make everyone disappear when I listen to her music. Enjoy! Tom"
2,Consider a flash drive instead!,Be wary of this and other microdrives! Mine first unit lasted a couple of months and just today-less than a year later-another bites the dust. Since these devices have moving parts they are prone to breaking without warning. Both units of mine were not dropped or experience any extreme conditions but failed anyway. I will purchase flash drives from now on.
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought the Travel Drive because it was the largest capacity small drive I could find. Plus I trusted the Memorex brand. What a mistake. Mine just died after 8 weeks of use. Because I rely on it for my work I need it replaced ASAP but I first have to e-mail Memorex, who says they will respond the next day, and then my drive will be replaced in 3-4 weeks! Considering that the drive is an expensive and crucial piece of hardware I would think they could replace it sooner than that, like in a day or two. This is the last time I'll be buying any Memorex product."
1,Worst thing I've never bought,"I bought my mega drive on sale for $100 and 13 months ago, that was a deal. It was convenient having 8 gigabytes of memory to store my teaching and research materials on.Unfortunately, a few weeks ago, while I was transfering some files over to a computer, an error message popped up on screen and the flash drive stopped connecting to computers.Memorex was no help at all in replacing my flash drive, or even giving me any leads as to how I could get it repaired.I finally tried contacting Seagate and their data recovery rates are a flat rate of $250 for thumb drives or $500 for hard drives.My advice for those interest in this product is to LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
1,worked great and then bam! dead,"This product worked great and was quite useful because of its large capacity but small size (most thumb drives are 1 or 2 GB), but it crashed without warning. All the data is lost and there is no way to recover it, even by professionals. What a waste! Stay away. Memorax is great for CDs and DVDs, not so great for HDs."
1,Great product for a few weeks and then it stops working,"I agree with all the reviews. This product was expensive but it worked great . I was very pleased with the storage capabilities it has. After a few weeks of using it for a small business, it completely stopped working- losing all the files saved on it. Customer service will not honor any requests for repairs unless you have a receipt dated within a year of purchase- which i dont have."
1,No chance for use,"I had the Memorex mega traveler in my closet for a while. I finally decided to use it. I inserted it into my laptop and it worked for a few minutes, then it died. I attempted to recover what I had on the drive with no success. Do not buy this product; it is not even a one star. It is a negative(-) 5 stars."
2,Typos,I am only on the third chapter and there are so many typos including spelling and punctuation that it becomes distracting from the message. Wasn't this book proof-read prior to publishing? It makes it hard to stay focused on the content
2,Not what I expected. My fault to some extent,"The product I ordered was apparently an old yearly supplement to the book ""Drunk Driving Defense"". I paid way to much for a supplement book that was outdated and probably discarded by someone who bought the new supplement.I don't remember the ad and it may have been my fault for not being more observant."
1,Bad Law,"I opened the book to a random page and read an excerpt from an appellate case.* It struck me as odd, so I looked the case up. Turns out, the cited case was reversed 6 months after it was published, and 20 years before this book was published. To me, that automatically makes this book unacceptable.*page 58 at the bottom, if you're interested"
5,"Exquisite, Detailed","I've had this book for many years. The projects provided are exquisite in style, though certainly not 21st century in design. The author works in both needlepoint and crewel, and there is a bit of crewel over aneedlepoint base as well.The author gives extremely detailed instructions as to how to go about making the designs. I learned a lot about set up and execution of needlepoint without a painted canvas from this book, as well as a lot about finishing stitched items properly.I recommend this book as a second addition to anyone's needlepoint library, after Jo Ippolito Christensen's ""Needlepoint"", which, of course, is the needlepointer's bible. If crewel is your medium, I think you'll be hard pressed to find something better than Boyle."
5,THIS CD IS THE SHXT,"THIS CD IS TIGHT NEVER THE LESS...HES REPRESENTING MCKEESPORT PA IN FULL AFFECT, I HONESTLY DONT THINK THERE HAS BEEN A BETTER RAPPER SINCE 2PAC"
2,"Material is interesting, but a bit too technical for the average reader","I read this book for a class. The topic of Brasilia to me is one that is fascinating and it was great to read the history of this, but for me it was made more complex than was necessary. This could have been a very fun read, but instead if was weighed down by technical margin and in depth politics."
5,Text book for all High School Seniors,"This book is a simple text book for all High School Seniors. It touches on subjects that we take for granted. Joe has written it in such a way that we can all laugh at ourselves and what we learned when we were ""Out On Our Own...Now What?"". Our company offers an internship program for our employees kids and this book is one of the main subjects we discuss, basic life skills and simple ""How to"" instructions. Over the past 5 years, between our company and myself, over 100 copies have been given to kids and each of the kids has come back and said ""Thank you, it was full of good ideas"" or ""Without this book, I would have made a big mistake buying my first car"". I would absolutely recommend this book to everyone, adults included as it is full of humor, common sense and good sound advice."
4,Great mixer for the price.,"The price tag is not hefty at all, which is good. This mixer is great if you have more than 2 input devices. I use two turntables and two cd players at the moment. The audio equalizer at the top works great, increase bass and treble and whatever. The effects are useless, just there to take up space I guess, but this is a great mixer, I say buy it, unless you can afford something bigger."
5,Great Product,"I have used this for about 3 years now and have enjoyed it thoroughly. It does a lot more than previously expected. Special effects, not super quality but you really can't beat it. Has plenty of inputs and outputs, I can do almost anything with this. I would buy another one if I needed to."
1,"Unwatchable, don't buy it!",The sound hisses all the time. The picture is unwatchable. This DVD was transferred from a very bad film copy or even some crap VHS.
1,Complete Junk,"I found satellite faster using DirecTV receiver and this added nothing to my speed. If you have an iPhone, consider the Dishpointer AR Pro app. It is $19.99 but for the money it shows you through your camera on iPhone or iPad where the satellite is in the sky, that there are no obstructions BEFORE YOU SET UP, and helps you align azimuth perfectly. Simply listen to the receiver while adjusting elevation and fine tune for highest reception. I've got it down to about 5 minutes total adjustment on my dish with this setup after 3 tries."
1,Satellite Finder Dish Aiming Meter,"Maybe I didn't understand the instructions, but I never found the satellite. I end up going back to my compass, a portable TV and the tool provided by direct TV. I would not recommend this to a freind."
4,Exactly as advertised,"I received this product on time and it arrived exactly as promised. As previously stated, provided instructions are not overly helpful, however, if you put the devise in line between the dish and the receiver it help tremendously in locating the satellite signal. I would purchase again."
2,Not clear directions,Product does not come with clear directions. Ended up walking in and out of house checking the signal strenght on receiver. would not recommend this product unless you are fimilar with using it.
3,OK I Guess,"Sensitivity is difficult to set, and I never could figure out which Sat. it was looking at. It did get me in the ball park though and it was cheap so if thats what you need then go for it."
5,Pointing a Dish 1000,"I found a good suggestion on the web to cover the two outer LNBs with tin foil when aiming a dish 1000 with the meter as the dish can easily be centered on the wrong satellite. After pre-setting the skew and elevation for my zip code according to installation instructions, I covered the two outer LNBs with foil and swung the dish slowly and found all three satellites. I chose the center one and uncovered the LNBs, ran a set switch on the receiver and I had all three satellites indicated as ok. I then peaked the dish on 119 in my case using the receiver point dish screen and I was good to go. Dishpointer.com is a great visual aid to find a good spot to plant your dish. I did not want it mounted on the roof and a backyard fence worked as a good mounting location."
1,wrong adress,"the address for the finder was wrong, and we returned but we haven't got our money back. when are we going to get are money back?"
1,does not work as expected...,"Looks simple to use, but when arrived, tried to make use of this instruction but it is really vague and hard to use. gave up couple tries about 2-3hours. End up using a different method to find my satellite...the old way!"
2,Did not work for Directv 5 LNB.,This did not function properly to allow me to find signal on my 5 LNB DirectTv satellite. Trial and error and Iphone apps are still the best way I find to align this dish.
1,"Opps, made a mistake",Bought this signal finder thinking it would be the cat's-meow...... Mistaken; never did get it to work. What works best is to use the signal finder given by the Direct TV setup.
3,Audubon field guide for Hawaii,"This book will give you a basic idea of birds to be found in Hawaii and the pictures are good. However, it does not include pictures of female , juvenile or birds in non-breeding plumage or in most cases even give written descriptions of how juvenile and females differ in appearance from male birds. I found this very frustrating as I saw birds which did not fit any of the given pictures and had no way to figure out what they were. Anyone who is a serious birder like I am will be unhappy with this book and amateur birders are going to be left wondering why they can't identify some of the birds they see."
3,Based on a true story!!!,"What most folks probably don't know is that movie was based on a true story. Back in the early 80's, I was a foreman of a jury in NYC that convicted a guy of kidnapping a couple and raping the woman in a midtown hotel. It was a pretty interesting case, especially for a first-time juror!Suffice it to say, though, that the movie takes liberties with the real story. Personally, I found real life a bit more fascinating than what ended up in the movie. But that's Hollywood!"
1,Spineless Imbecile,"I would like to know who is the spineless imbecile that, after having read this ""book"" can give a positive review of it."
1,Don't use your money for this kind of books,"I bought this book because I'm really interested in improving my skill in creating and managing partnerships for my company and I was attracted by the positive reviews on Amazon.Com. Reading the first pages I was unpleasantly surprise by the unbelievable miserable level of this book. I suspect that these reviewers that claim to be CEO and top manager of Fortune 500 companies are just friends and relatives of Sarah. For example, I check the city where of one of these ""CEO"" is supposed to live and discovered that it doesn't even exist.When you read the book you understand while Sarah needs to push in such unfair way her book (self reviewing). I'm not a CEO but sincerely I recommend everybody to look somewhere else for a good book. This is not a good book at all."
4,Brainless but good,"If you are just figuring out the world of business and partnerships, this book is for you. I've been in it for over twenty years, and much of this is simply put, brainless. One could argue that what Ms. Gerdes has done is nothing more than take obvious patterns and call them trends. Or common processes and call them models. Her tools sets are about the most obvious things in the world, but maybe someone, somewhere out there needs partnerships reduced to the most basic level. Not everyone can afford to hire McKinsey Consulting, which is a good thing for Ms. Gerdes, since she has used the Suze Orman approach to writing. Advanced partner managers beware, you will hate this book. Everyone else who likes Oprah and Suze Orman will probably love it."
1,Useless,"Useless - this was just a long commercial for the author's services. Worse yet, I paid for it. Very little concrete information. Very disapp"
2,"Don't be fooled, this is not a rerelease","This isn't really a re-release because it's missing 2 songs from the original recording which is on a different label. These are: ""I Can't Help It"" and ""There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight"". I find it unbelievable that two songs would be omitted which reduces this to a 41 minute recording. I also find it arrogant that Roy Clark's picture appears alone with even Joe Pass's name reduced in type size, implying that Roy Clark is the headliner...not! Collector's will look elsewhere."
1,Beware: this is not leather,"Buyers beware: this is not a leather ball as stated in the description. Rather, it is a rubber, outdoor, low-quality ball.I have now gotten five (5) WNBA basketballs from Amazon, and all of them have been wrong, two of this model and three of another. When this particular model was sent to me, I contacted Amazon, stating that it was not the leather ball described, and they sent another ball that was exactly the same.Amazon tried to tell me that the balls were mis-packaged, but all of the balls that I have received have been accurately labeled as outdoor (not leather indoor) balls."
5,A Perceptive View of US-China Relations,"Ross combines thorough research into both Chinese and American materials with a useful theoretical perspective to yield the definitive guide to the ups and downs of China-US ties. He correctly views each side's waxing and waning influence as a function of situational strategic advantage--first in the US-Chinese-Soviet ""strategic triangle"" and, later, bilaterally--and shows how changes in global politics affect mutual perceptions of interest and thus drive changes in policy. Lucid, well-researched (although Ross's frequent use of Chinese ""scholarly"" sources--which are often little more than official documents under the imprimatur of the Beijing bishopric--has its periodic down-side), and convincingly argued, this is the essential title on the topic."
3,Starting to go downhill,"Season 4 and 5 of Vice for me were too strange. The plots, feel, and entire series just wasn't the same. Of course there were still some good episodes and surprises, but overall it wasn't the same as season 1-3."
5,Brings Back A Lot Of Memories!,"When the TV series was first launched in 1984 I was a teenager. What teenage boy doesn't enjoy seeing a Ferrari or a Wellcraft Scarab racing across the TV screen?Now, 20+ years later, I have been watching the Season 1 - 4 DVDs (Season 5 is being shipped this week). It brings back a lot of memories!If you watched and enjoyed the TV show, I don't know what I can say that you don't already know. Technically, the video and audio quality is very good.Watching Crockett and Tubbs speed across the screen in that white Testarossa while listening to those old Phil Collins ('In The Air Tonight') and Glenn Frey ('Smugglers Blues') songs... what more could you ask for? :)"
5,Oh God.....,"Miami Vice. What can be said. ground breaking 80's TV series. Love dit as a kid, and now i can love it as aan adult"
1,HORRENDOUS,"After the PERFECT 3 and I mean PERFECT. Not a single bad episode in 3. That all changes fast in Season 4 which is just completely awful. Just AWFUL! Season 4 is not the least bit Miami Vice. It's more like MTV Cops/ Crockett's Mis-Adventures. It's very, very bad. Extemely cheap looking and there isn't any action. The heart and soul that was seen in every episode of 3 is not seen in one episode of the pathetic Season 4. Don Johnson who expressed one hell of an ego in 3 and looked so cool in every episode in dark stylish, expensive threads. In Season 4 he looks absolutely silly in his cheaply made clothes. I think he got most of his clothes at the nearest swap meet. He also looks bored and tired, just like the viewer is, when watching this garbage and thinking when is Miami Vice going to come back. Well it comes back in Season 5, to make sure it goes out with a BANG!"
2,Too snarky,"I wanted to like this book. The American Revolution is something that has always fascinated me. This account by Leckie is too heavy on unsourced opinion that belittles towering historical figures. He may be accurate, but the casual reader will never know because the author tries too hard to be witty and cute.at one point , he challenges John Adams own account of his life by casting him as a whining insecure child without one corroborated source. Too important of a topic too trust a cynic with."
4,Excellent Primer of the American Revolution,I would recommend this book as the first to read when studying the war. Excellent portrayal of general events and how they happened. A very good general account of the major names of that day and how they contributed to the war. Could have used better/more detailed maps. A must read for those that study American history.
4,A military history,"This book has a slow start, and anytime Leckie's discusses ideology the writing is ponderous and unsophisticated. But the bulk of bulk is a wonderful read if you enjoy military history. Leckie's narative shows the eye of a soldier and a welcome readiness to share his judgements. Leckie also does a competent job in giving the background of the conflict and painting a portait of the personalities behind the action."
5,Thrilled,Easy to use and operate. You only need a few cap fulls of the cleaner to a whole tnak of water so econimical! Turned dull items into sparklers! I highly recommend it!
4,Worked for final cleaning of technical pen nibs and parts.,"I used it for final cleaning of technical pen nibs and parts using warm water. This was after bulb cleaning and soaking in denatured alcohol. Success was declared by the removal of residual amounts of ink from the threaded retainer rings and the nibs worked fine. I did buy a ""can strainer"" from BB&B (which fit perfectly) to insure no parts made it through the supplied holder."
2,"Not the best, bad in my opinion","this is not for people with absolutely no background in c-language or programming. The way teaching is carried out in this textbook is terrible. It teaches what nouns,verbs,and subjects are, but doesn't teach how to relate all that into a sentence. The examples are nothing but sentences with no explanation as to how the nouns, verbs, and subjects relate or interact with each other. That is the best analogy i can think of as to how this book doesn't do its job very well. If you have four years to learn C, sure buy this book, take a month on each chapter and you're good. In America, everything needs to be done fast, this is not the fastest or most efficient teaching tool for C++. Period"
1,An utterly horrible book,"This is one of the worst text books I have ever used. It explains concepts in a way that is very difficult to understand. It turns an interesting subject into a dull, hard to follow, tedious exercise. Do yourself a favour and buy any other C book."
1,This book was written for instructors and not students.,The book stinks. The authors do not recommend what compiler to use. I am not happy with the book.This book was written so that the authors could show off for their friends. It was not written for a beginner.
1,The worst introduction to C programming.,"Don't buy this book, this is the worst C book I ever seen.The contents are confusing and examples are not covering the whole chapter.If your school uses this book, buy another C reference book and don't even bother to read this one."
1,"WORST C PROG TEXTBOOK, ONLY MAKING MONEY TEACHER SELECT THIS BOOK","I must say this textbook is notorious .I really can not believe a good professor will choose this c programming book as textbook!!!.firstly the organization of this book is bad enough. very unusual compare to most c programming books.secondly: many sample used in this textbook make students crazy ,because writer use some function which mentioned in the next few chapter!!third: I believe and proof the teacher define this book as textbook can make money!! just ask your professor why not to choose other classic and very cheap c programming textbooks as our c programming textbook!!this textbook is totally trash.I give this book bad review cause I read many c programming book already."
3,Needs to better organized,"I have had a previous C class to the one that I am going through currently. While several of the topics seem to be well organized, there are important topics such as pointers that are poorly treated. Instead of devoting a chapter to pointers the author has scattered them over several chapters without an organized effort to insure the reader of this book understands this important subject. Even my instructor expressed his dismay at the poor treatment of pointers.There is the other problem of inadaquate explainations though out the book. As a student, this is not helpfull when I am trying to learn C.I do hope that the fifth edition will better organized. If it weren't for the college class requireing this book I would be more dis-pleased than I am. Are you are looking for a book to learn C from? My advise, look some where else."
3,More bad than good,"This book is not for beginners to programming. The examples are hard to follow. They start with a simple idea then the next example adds information to the example and then you get lost. How about one idea at a time and several examples of that one idea. That would be better for beginners. I have read other C programming books and this is not the best. Waite's group books are the best there is. Next in line would be the How to Program series by Deitel & Deitel. The best point of the book is how it discusses pointers. Since pointers are a concept that folds many ideas into one the authors chose to discuss pointers in regards to these separate ideas. Meaning that there is no single chapter on pointers but parts of four different chapters. The other strong point of this book is that you do get a compiler to work with, so it isn't all bad."
2,There are better books out there,"This book is as dry as they come, while the concepts are easy to follow it lacks the depth of a good programming book. Money would be better spent on ""C How to Program"" by H.M. Deitel/P.J. Deitel.The book is layed out much better and the major concepts are in a different color so if you need to go back and review you don't have to search for what you need like you need to in this Problem Solving book."
4,Perfect for C beginners!,"I had experience before with Fortran, Pascal, Visual Basic before, but never really got into C until I had this book. It has a perfect layout. It took me a day or two to get a grasp of the general programming structure of ANSI C with the help of this book. It's the BEST for absolute beginners as well as for people who had some experience with other languages before. It's only drawback to me is it's lack of coverage on network and database programming."
5,An excellent way to start off in C programming,"I found this text to be very informative for the beginner in the C language. The chapter contents give the beginner plenty of information to give him an excellent grasp on the lesson being conveyed by the author. A great amount of examples are provided in each chapter, which I find to be the best way of insuring that the reader totally understands the idea. These examples guide the reader through the process, step by step, making sure to highlight the importance of each application.As a testament to how great this book is, I can tell you that I relied on the book as much as I relied on the lecture by my professor. I sat with my friends in my C class, so many times I found it hard to concentrate because they were too busy fooling around. Since I missed out on comprehending some of the C lectures, I made sure to read the chapter taught, every night after class. I got an A- for the semester!!!"
1,Sucks,It never works and my tamagotchi ran away he bit me and sucked off my face! It is retarded because it talks back at me! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you do there will be danger a foot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,All it is is a complete waste of money. I hate this thing. It got me sent to the principals office. If you buy it you have a ticket of first class to the principal's office. It will just get you in trouble.DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You will be happy you did
5,Into Great Silence,"The Monks of the Grande Chartreuse offer us a view into their world through their chants and noises (bells and sounds as they move in their surroundings). It takes the listener to another world.....a great CD to meditate with, read with or just have quiet time with the monks. If you have not seen ""Into Great Silence"" and are interested in the life of the monks its well worth watching. After seeing the documentary I quickly ordered the CD."
1,Not Great Singing. A Marketing Rip-off,"While I suppose this is meant to take a listener back into the movie, which I very much appreciate, and I bought it from Amazon, I did not realize what I was buying when I bought this CD. Having bought it, I feel ripped off: this, to my mind, is a ploy to extend revenues. For Gregorian Chant one can buy CDs of the monastic choirs of Solesmes and Fontgaumbult, to name only two sources of Gregorian Chant that have great sound quality and choirs. This ""sound track"" of the movie, complete with stray, unidentifiable noises, displays a mediocre choir and very poor sound quality. If you must have it, buy it used. I have one for sale."
2,Not a great buy,"Not what I expected. Extremely slow images, very poor singing. I understand that slowness and detachment from the World were the key intentions of the film director, but he could have handled in a totally different way. I would not recommend it to anybody."
1,Boring,"I found this video a bit boring. It's better to buy a book with pictures in it, it felt like the same thing. I bought it bc the reviews were so high, but very disappointed. Read a book!"
3,okay,They liked it. I like that it was made in the USA. I thought the thread was a little thin in some areas. Also when it arrived the box was soaking wet on one end: ( It was wrapped in a plastic bag so it did not get too wet. I would have liked it to be bigger. I felt the price plus shipping was a little high. That said they did seem to like it.
5,Gift for neighbors,"they loved this throw - not too big, not too small. Was a great gift idea and was a hit."
5,Splendid Handel,"I am a fan of Handel's music. These works were not known to me until I listened to the samples on Amazon. I am and was deeply impressed, and this CD is a new favorite on my Handel list. The vocals and instrumentation are spiritually uplifting. O' those Handel trumpets."
3,It was okay!!,"This guide was okay. There were some good activities, but due to time, we were unable to do them. I was looking for something more detailed."
1,Because of Winn Stupid!,I thought it was a boring book but that is because i am a boy and there was like no action at all. But any ways this book is about a girl named Opal that moves to a trailor park and finds a dog. This book is kind of sad. I recommend this book to girls because girls love animals and sad stuff and boys like action and goofy stuff. So if you a girl and you are reading this i recommend this book to you!
1,"This is Disrespect, not tribute.","Joh Fogerty is probably the most under-rated musician in history of Rock. One reason is his famous famous fall-out with Mr. Greed - Vantz Kant Danz which really caused graet emotional and financial hardship for him. JCF is the only musician who was sued and taken to the court for ""immitating his OWN music!!!"", obviously the case was dismissed. I think this so called tribute is another form of ""up yours"" by the music and art world's FAT CATS. It is HURRIBLE."
3,If you can get past the stereotypes . . .,"The character of the hero in this book is one of the better ones I have seen, but the others leave a lot to be desired. Why are scientists socially inept and repressed? Like the heroine of this novel, I am distracted by ridiculous occurrences in the plot (anyone who wears a lab coat knows you keep it in the lab, or contaminate everything you own). I could only enjoy this book by pretending that the terrible portrayal of scientists was incidental. As often happens in books that are part of a series, there are many secondary characters whose development is unsatisfatory. Not a bad book, but not one I would recommend, especially to a scientist."
5,Better than $200 recorders,"Looking at the design of this you'd think it wouldn't work very well but it's actually quite awesome. It works better than a complicated $200 setup I used to have that recorded the conversation directly from the phone wire. None of the recorders that record from the wire work all that great, unless maybe you want to spend $1000.This has the best quality of all the recorders I've tested and it's quite cheap. All you need is a handheld voice recorder and you're good to go."
3,Works as advertised--once you have something to plug in to,Was hoping I could plug it right into my computer. Nope. But it's been working just fine with my Zoom H4N recorder--once I figured out which settings to use (plug in power ON). Works exactly as advertised. Records both ends of a phone call. Local end very loud and clear. Remote end sounds like a recorded phone call. Which it is!
5,Ear-bud Phone recorder is a great innovation,"We are using an Olympus WAS-331M Digital Voice Recorder for interviews for an academic research project, and found that some interviews needed to be done by phone. At first I was surprised that Olympus' telephone recording device was an ear-bud instead of attaching to the phone cord. Then I realized what an improvement it was - you can use it on a cordless phone, a cell phone, or a call over a computer through the internet! The sound quality is great - or as good as your phone connection, anyway.Two notes: (1) It comes with two adapter jacks, but the instructions are minimal to figure out which to use. (2) Make sure to plug the jack into the recorder's ""mic"" plug, not the ""ear"" plug. It will still record if plugged into the wrong jack, but the sound quality will be terrible."
1,"Audio, excellent; but wire lifetime, 3 months at most",There is no question that the audio part of this device works well; but what use is it if the wire would not last more than 3 months. The wire protection is of rubber material which softens after several days. After 2 moinths you will see ruptures in some parts of the wire.
1,Using the Olympus TP7 with the I-Pod Touch,"I received the Olympus TP7 and tried using it with my Ipod Touch since the Ipod Touch has recording capabilities. However, when I recorded a conversation the person's voice on the other line comes out very low. So low is the voice that it is more like a murmur; you can't really decipher what the person is saying. I had the volume to the max on the Ipod but to no avail. I do not know if the TP7 that I got was defective or if it simply does not work with the Ipod Touch. I would like to test it on an Olympus Digital Recorder, but I don't have one. To me it was more convenient to use it with my Ipod because I carry it everywhere all of the time and it is less obvious that you may be using the Ipod as a recording device."
1,Worthless,"I bought this back in March to record business cards. It worked twice!!! I went to use it today, took it out of its box, and it did not work. I am glad it only cost $15 because it is completely worthless."
2,Too many DOA,"This may be a good product, but I wouldn't know. All the ones I have received were dead-on-arrival. Ever the optimist, I will try one more time."
3,Was not what I expected,I was expecting this to connect directly to my phone.It wasn't worth the trouble to return.
4,works far better than I'd expected,"I was dubious that an in-ear microphone would effectively record conversations, but this works beautifully. I'd been using a device that plugs into a landline phone, and it is liberating to be able to record from my cell phone and conduct interviews away from my desk. I've only used it several times so far, so I can't attest to its longevity, but at this price, if it broke tomorrow I'd probably replace it with the same item."
4,Olympus TP-7 Telephone Microphone,"Works great, easy to use. A must have if yu want to easily record conversations on a digital recorder. I Use it with a RCA VR5220-A Excellent sound quality.Olympus TP-7 Telephone Recording Device"
5,Works Like It Should,"This is simple to use, and it works very well. Just plug it into your recording device, put the earbud in your ear, and it records both sides of the conversation."
3,Just OK,It was the only product of its kind but the sound quality and volume is not up to what I would expect.
3,Acceptable,"Works fine. The quality of the record is good, in particular clear. The coated of the wire is not good. I suppose that his util life isn't very long."
4,"So simple, works very well.","The picup sits in your ear. If you can hear it, it records well. Marked it down to 4 stars because the wire is very thin and tangles easily. It appears sturdy enough, however."
4,Works great,"Since the iPhone won't let you record conversations, I did some research and came up with this and a digital recorder. It works great, however, I gave it a 4 because it ear piece gets wax in it and it looses it's effectiveness. There's no way to clean in out without puncturing the screen and scooping it out. Sorry if that's gross, but that's what I had to do... I'm not a super waxy ears person either, with regular earphones, I've had not problems... Also, I see the current price is $50!!! Seriously? I think I paid about $13. There's no way this is worth $50, you can get a far more advanced set up for that kind of money."
5,Olympus TP-7 Is An Excellent product,"I have used this product several times with a standard cordless telephone, and I have found it to be an excellent product. The audio playback quality has far surpassed my expectations and I would recommend this accessory for anyone who may need to use it to record conference calls, etc. The earbud design seems quite comfortable, but I have yet to try using it with a cell phone. A great purchase."
5,Works better than expected,I have an Olympus ws-110 recorder and the TP7 ear mic to conduct interviews for research. My current setup is through a telephony system on my PC. I wear a headset with the TP7 in my ear and the recording is better than I expected. It works for me.
2,Worked for about a week...,I received this on time and was excited to get it as I record a podcast and this would be helpful for recording incoming phone calls. It worked great for about a week then it just gave out.
2,Does NOT work with iPhone,"This product works as many reviews have stated, but not with iPhone/iPod touch regardless of adapters, apps you buy for iOS, etc. Not sure why that is, but I scoured the internet for about 30 minutes on at least 2 different occasions, found nothing official, but multiple sites/forums with people asking the same questions.I'm giving two stars as I this should be made clear by the distributor. Prior to spending an hour or so trying to figure this out, and not using the device for about a month I had emailed asking if this can work with the iPhone and if so how...Their response:""What's in the BoxMicrophone, adapter to convert from monaural 3.5 mm mini-plug tostereo 3.5 mm mini-plug, and monaural 3.5 mm mini-plug to monaural 2.5mm mini-plug adapter.""Not great customer service in my opinion."
1,loud interference,I tried using this with a Sony digital recorder and cell phone and the interference is so bad that the conversation is inaudible.
2,Audio pickup of voice on other end of call is poor.,"I installed it as directed. When I played it back, my voice came out fine, but the voice on the other end was faint, and barely audible.The only saving grace was that I was able to return it without any issue. Feel free to test it out if you'd like; you can always return it if dissatisfied.As an alternative, I suggest using a landline with 2 phones - have your conversation on one, and leave the other one on speakerphone+mute in a separate room, and record the speakerphone set phone with a regular tape recorder."
4,"Works good, but doesnt transfer to other devices","When connected to the Olympus recorder, it works great. It doesnt obstruct the sound from my cellphone or head set (though it doesnt fit well with the bluetooth ear bud), and provides clear sound.My only complaint is that when plugging it into some other devices (like my computer's microphone jack) it doesnt seem to work... I guess I'll need some kind of adapter.For the price, I'm pleased overall."
5,Great Recording Quality at an Affordable Price,"The TP7 works great... if you have a problem, it's most likely your tape recorder! I bought it to record some phone calls. After reading the reviews I was nervous about it not recording the person I was talking to loudly enough. In fact, when I first tried it, I was disappointed. I used an old mini-cassette... I was very clear and the other party was VERY low... almost inaudible. Turns out that the MIC input didn't supply power to the TP7... then I realized I was actually listing to a recording made by the internal microphone of the tape player, NOT via my Olympus TP7. I went out and bought a new digital recorder (SONY PX-312) and it works like a charm. Amazingly clear on both ends of the conversation. Perfect for what I need. Perfect product and low cost... I love it!!"
5,Have had one for many many years,"I was looking to record job hunting calls. A Radio Shack manager told me that our local police all carried these. They can covertly record interactions from what otherwise appears to be radio earphone.The audio quality still amazes me for recording calls but now days many smart phones can record calls internally (legal both in/out in Colorado). Carrying long corded ear-mic and recorder was a nuisance, but with complicated severe illness and medications now fogging my mind it has proven vital for recording Dr appts and important business else I quickly forget most before I can even take notes. In this way it has proven to be a life saver."
3,Good not great,"This microphone seems well made, despite being inexpensive, and the sound quality is good. But there are disadvantages. First, you have to wear it in your ear as you talk. That's awkward for me. I can feel it between the phone and my ear and it gets in the way, sonically -- you don't hear as well with it in. Worse, it records my voice much more loudly than the person at the other end of the line.So, yes, it works, and yes, I can get used to it, but it's not an ideal solution."
1,stupid technology,this should plug directly from your phone into the recorder without having to sit in your ear.for people with latex allergies it is impossible to use.
2,Seems complicated,I haven't used it because it seems too complicated. To use this device you have to put it in your ear. Usually I already have a blue tooth ear piece in my ear. I was hoping for a recording device that would hook to the phone base somehow.
2,This sucks,"If you're as dumb as me, you'll buy this. if you're smart.... you wouldn't buy this piece of *&$%!"
4,works well but not real comfortable,this product does what is was intended to do and does it well. you do need to wear this in your ear while you take your phone call so it's a tad uncomfortable when you have this in and then press the earpiece of your phone up to your ear.overall I like it but wonder if something that attached to my desk phone would be better.
4,An idiot's guide to using this thing,"For the technologically challenged, this is how it works: you plug one end of the cable into the ""mic""outlet of your recording device, and put the little mic at the other end in your inner ear. Thenyou put your phone headset up to the same ear the mic is in, and the little mic picks up bothsides of the conversation. (I'd used earlier generation products that required plugging wires into the phoneand was temporarily flummoxed -- couldn't figureout how it worked.) I've just used it once so far in a test, but it's simple and easy even for me."
4,It works!,It works exactly as it is supposed to. It is easy to use and doesn't take up any room to store because it is so small. I also like that the cord is long enough to reach without pulling.
3,recording calls,works fairly well. I think it would be much more expensive to get something that worked much better. You just have to make sure you don't speak too loudly and that the person your speaking with speaks loud enough.
2,"Good idea, but poor performance","i bought two of these because my job required me to tape business conversations on the phone. These are VERY hard to use and work poorly. Easier to put the phone on speaker and tape that. It was important to have a good, complete tape recording of my work and these did not do the job."
1,Waste of money....,"Waste of money. Didn't work after a week. Too flimsy. Wire to thin. Wouldn't stay in my ear. This is the second time I bought this item, thinking maybe it was me...but it wasn't."
2,not good for tile,It was wishful thinking that a carbide tipped hole saw would cut tile. The hole saw just spins and spins and eventually makes a groove. For wall tile a carbide grit hole saw works much better and for floor tile one needs to use a diamond hole saw. The Milwaukee carbide tipped does not work very well on chipboard either as there is not much offset with the teeth and so the side wall rubs the entire time it is cutting. It is OK for fiberglass and for fiber cement board like Hardie siding where it lasts 4 times as long as a bi-metal hole saw. Getting the cut piece out is a chore as the side slots only go part of the way. The tungsten carbide hole saws with the slots that go the entire length of the side are a lot faster to clear to start the next hole. Very expensive for the little gain in performance with Hardie board and bi-metal hole saws are a better way to go unless you have to make a lot of holes and then the TCT hole saws work best.
4,Another Solid Effort From Staeger,"Staeger has followed up his debut, Painkiller, with another well-written story. The interaction between Cooper & Laramie help form one of the more dynamic and entertaining relationships in fiction. Cooper is, in a word, compelling. There's still more to learn about Laramie, but that's part of the appeal. The reader can relate to Cooper as he tries to figure her out. The story doesn't rate five stars because, other than the Polar Bear, the other secondary characters do not stand out."
1,Very disappointing. Save your money.,"I found the suggestions to be very ordinary, unoriginal and repetitive. You've seen these dozens of times. Some were downright silly - tying aprons to the backs of chairs. The photography left a lot to be desired too with unimaginative arrangements and amature photography. If I had had the opportunity to leaf through it first, I would not have bought this book."
1,Not for me,"I've had poisen ivy, oak...numerous times. This did not work for me. Just deal with the 4 weeks of hell. Lol.."
1,"Not a Hawkwind Album, Not Original Material","***************************Personnel* Dave Brock - guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, vocals* Richard Chadwick - drums (Dreamers, Earth Calling and Space Pilots)* Crum - keyboards (Dreamers)* Richard Jackson - sequence programmer (Sex Dreams)***************************Technical StuffThe album has decent sound quality. No loudness war issues.***************************The MusicFirst, this is not a Hawkwind album. Hawkwind has always been a group, and the only real composer/performer here is Brock, so it is a Brock solo album. Further, most of the material is just reworked bits for other Hawkwind albums. And the bits that have been reworked are really weak. Most of the tracks are under two minutes, so they really don't go anywhere. The music is mostly Brock goofing with sequencers and drum machines, and laying sampled audio from tv and radio overtop.***************************SummaryFor completists only."
1,dave brock is insane!,"this is definitely the worst HAWKWIND album! it's really justa DAVE BROCK solo album. on this album,which i owned for onlyone month, BROCK continues his fascination with synthesizers andsampling. there are no real SONGS here, just little synthesizerand keyboard doodlings. the packaging is ugly and the songwritingcredits and lyrics incomplete. a huge disappointment.i can't recommend this!!! my main problem withthis album is that DAVE BROCK has been doing this synthesizer,electronic, techno thing to death on the last three or fourHAWKWIND albums and I think it's time he moved on to somethingelse. this is getting very old and very stale. trust me, thisalbum IS as bad as I say it is!!"
4,Very comfortable to use,"I use this mouse with my HP laptop. I debated about getting a cordless model but since I usually set my laptop up on a table or desk I decided it wasn't necessary. The cord on this mouse is the right length, not so long it's in the way, but also not so short you can't switch from left side to right. It's also surprisingly comfortable to use. The colored areas on either side are recessed to provide a comfortable grip for your thumb and fingers, and the scroll wheel is slightly rubberized for steady, non-slip scrolling. I didn't expect much considering the price, but I actually like it better than the full-sized mouse I use with my desktop computer!"
1,SO unacceptable,"This is my first time writing a review for any sort of items I got, certainly I feel as if this is a must!! When I was reading all the good reviews for this item I was thinking since it is cheap, why not. The moment I opened the packet, I am in shock. The size I ordered was the smallest size 1 fitted for a 4'11""-5'~, I was 5'1"" and petite so I was so sure it would fit. Plus nornally when I go out and buy a pair of legging, any sort of size small would fit me perfectly fine without a problem. The pantyhose I recieved was like a pair of sheer PANT! not even my size pant in the matter of fact, I can literally put 2 legs in one side (just to tell you how huge it was on me). Not only that the packaging I got was almost unbelieveable as welll, it was not neatly sealed but partly like someone has already opened it to use when it was sent to me. I would have return it but it would be a waste of time anyhow. I do NOT recommend this product AT ALL unless you have legs that big!!!!!"
3,Ruth Hall: American Woman's Odessy,"This is a fasinating account of a single mother's experience in the mid-nineteenth century. Fanny Fern, pen name of Sara willis Parton, fictionalized her own experiences to create this account of life for a woman on her own in the 1850's. Fern's wryly ironic style and hold no punches revelations earned her fame and fortune and more than a small amount of criticism. If you thought all women were straightlaced and demure 150 years ago read this and learn."
5,Lose yourself in this voice,What this woman does with her voice! Nancy La Mott's smooth sound and enveloping emotion will transport you to another time and place. Her treatment of the lyrics on all these Johnny Mercer songs is unique and refreshing. I never heard Moon River like this before. Each of these arrangements is different and perfect. The acoustic treatment of these songs makes them feel much more intimate and touching. You'll feel you've made a new friend who is speaking directly to you. Get this recording.
5,Once in a long while,"Like comets that come around maybe once, or twice, in our lifetime, Nancy LaMott is a musical phenomenon that comes along only once in a great while. I will make no remarks about her musicality--it is unnecessary. All one needs is to hear her magical voice."
5,incredible!,Oh my gosh! Have I been under a rock? I got this CD as a gift from my daughter who bought it by mistake. I have listened to every track a hundred times and just now read that Nancy is dead. BUY THIS CD!!! she will draw you away from the pain of business or your husband making you crazy. she will take you to a cool club and you'll almost taste an icy martini while you listen to her incredible voice lull you into a better place. I am so sad she will not be singing anymore. I gotta get those other recordings and you will too!
2,WWII through the eyes of a modern progressive,"This was not what I had expected. The content is concentrated on social issues rather than events of the war or strategies. While the footage and letters used are obviously valid and interesting glimpses of the times, it appears that the selection of material and editing was done with respect to a modern progressive mindset.There were a lot of gruesome deaths in the war and many minorities were treated unfairly. If these are the aspects of the war that you wish to learn about, then this is the documentary for you. Otherwise, you *will* find some interesting information with regard to the war itself, but you will have to endure the former to get to it."
1,Highly inaccurate and biased,"Perilous fight is a thinly veiled re-edited version of World War II. Having read dozens and dozens of books on World War II and viewed numerous histories, as well as having visited historical sights related to WWII, both in Asia and Europe, the information here was so politically biased as to be ludicrous in its anti-war stance. It is no surprise then that the well known actor and anti-war activist Martin Sheen is its narrator. Insulting to the intelligence of the average person. Reading or viewing personal narratives of American soldiers and American prisoners of war in the Pacific arena would be far more enlightening as to what the U.S. was truly fighting for, not this poor re-write of history that is blatantly anti-American, Anti-war and Anti-truth. One of the least accurate ""histories"" I have come across. The only saving grace of this DVD is the color footage from the time period. Not recommended."
2,POCA AYUDA,El manual es muy generico e impractico. Lo primero que busque fue informacion sobre el actuador de los ejes frontales para diagnosticar y no hay absolutamente nada sobre este actuador...!!!!!!!!!!
3,get this if you like sly and robbie....,"This is a cool video. I wanted to hear what s & r were up too as I have been a fan of theirs since their black uhuru days. recently i have been more into downbeat and more modern sounding music. well i just got a dvd player and wanted to get something different. this is cool to check out the possibilities of dolby 5.1 and sly and robbie. of course it isnt horrible to see the naked dancers. it isnt the best in porn so if you want porn check out that guy from athens other reviews. i dont think he bought it to listen to sly and robbie ;-) anyways it could have been better if it had the option to watch some animated patterns, hubbel satelite photos of outer space, or something other than the strip club routine, but i enjoy the music mainly and i give sly and robbie credit for going in new directions.well,check it out if you like music,"
1,Strip to what ?,"If this is really ""Strip to the bone"" when dancers only stay topless, how must other striptease and sexy dancing videos that REALLY show off EVERYTHING (e.g Playboy's Best of Strip search) be called ? Strip to the molecules ? Let alone, that those awful light-strobo effects risk of giving you...epileptic crises even with a perfectly healthy brain... And there is nothing special about the music in it either. Ok, the ladies, especially some of them, really do have potential, but as a conclusion: If you want real hot sizzling exciting striptease action to be really turned-on with, stay away from it."
2,"So-so music, so-so softcore","When I purchased this DVD, I thought I was getting more animated videos like those on the Superthruster DVD single.I wasn't. I was getting a bunch of dancing strippers who didn't seem to have all that much to do with the music. By the time I realized this, I'd already opened the DVD and couldn't return it. I suppose the softcore isn't all that bad, but that sort of thing really doesn't turn me on that much.And most of the music wasn't even all that great, either (though I did enjoy a few of the tracks)."
5,Strong on repeat listenings,"After listening to this album for a week, I actually like this album better than the Feelies'Time for a Witness. I have always enjoyed Glenn Mercer's electric guitar and melodic songwriting with the Feelies, and he opens it up more in Wake Ooloo. In my opinion, the standout tracks are Nobody Heard, in the smooth acoustic Feelies style; and Forty Days, which is as good as or better than the electric songs on Time for a Witness. The Amazon sound clip doesn't contain any of the cool electric guitar solo in Forty Days. Any Minute is a decent song fitting in with the Feelies'Only Lifealbum. The song Rise goes more electric than anything the Feelies did - I love the solo which is the entire second half of the song. Some songs sound a little different. From Afar, a slow build leading up to a straight-ahead rock song, and Grains of Sand, which is an eerie acoustic piece. Both are really good. The sound clips don't do justice."
2,The moment is gone,"I am a fan of the Feelies, but I don't like this CD. The songs are not that good, and many of them don't really go anywhere. Rocks pretty hard, however, in a Stooges sort of way. Mercer's guitar does roar. I much prefer the CD 'Shore Leave', by Yung Wu (the Feelies performing Dave Weckerman's songs).It's time to leave the Feelies legend where it belongs--in the past. Bless them."
4,Code for Tomorrow review,Very good book. Intend to read the rest of the series. Book kept my interest and is sort of a WWII Horatio Hornblower.
2,A Code For tomorrow,"Four and one-half starts for a darn good story. One-half star for a really lousy job of formatting. (Applies to Kindle edition.) Not too terribly far into the book, all formatting was lost. No breaks for chapters or dialog at all. Made it hard to read. And then there were odd symbols for certain letters in words. Frustrating. Check this out on your devise and return the book if it happens to you."
5,Two from one of Anime's Bright New Stars,"Makoto Shinkai came upon the anime scene with a little anime short called ""She and Her Cat"" a few years ago and showed promise as a future director with vision. He has delivered with these two films. Voices of a Distant Star, as many know was done on his Mac on a shoestring budget but it doesn't keep you from becoming complete enthralled with its story of love and longing among the tragedies of war. Watching this movie was the first time I have ever had a tear come to eye while watching an anime feature. In 2005, The Place Promised in Our Early Days came out and it did not disappoint. The visuals are striking and its story of friendship and keeping of promises is not be missed, even if you are not an anime fan. I will continue to look for even better things from this director in the coming years."
5,dvd,"It came quickly and in good condition. Unfortunatly,it had to be returned. The person I bought it for already had one, but it wasn't taken off his Amazon list."
5,Eric Burden fans - this is the album for you!,"Loved the early stuff he did with the Animals, as well as the late 60's (Monterey, San Franciscan Nights, Sky Pilot, Spill the Wine). I wanted it all, but didn't want to buy several albums. Didn't have to with this CD. Thanks to the previous reviewers who steered me to this album, and thanks to Amazon for the quick delivery!"
5,Finally. Nothing is missing!,"Over the years, there has always been some type of ""greatest hits"" album from The Animals. But, it would always be missing 2 or 3 essential songs. Now, we finally have all their great tunes on one CD. Take a listen to ""Help Me Girl"". You never hear this song on the radio anymore. But, it sure stirs up some great memories for me. The piano riff does it. ""Sky Pilot"", ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"", ""Monterey"", ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" and other great songs round out the mix. And to get ""Spill the Wine"", too? This is a great CD with clean sound."
4,"A Great Sounding Collection, But...","I have an SACD/DVD-Audio Player and I was excited to see the DSD info on the CD packaging. If I'd only read the other reviews to find out this is NOT an SACD. The mastering is excellent and The Animals never sounded so good, but why hasn't ABKCO relabeled this package? It is a bit deceiving on their part. If anybody wants to hear how amazing an SACD or DVD-Audio Disc can sound check out The Beatles ""Love"". I hope the record companies start releasing these superior sounding discs once again."
4,Pretty good comp,"I don't have SACD so it's not an issue here.This includes almost all my favorite tracks from my two favorite Animal CDs that I've been listening to for years. ""The Singles Plus"" (EMI import from 1990) that had the original member lineup, and ""The Best Of Eric Burdon & The Animals, 1966-1968"" (a domestic Polydor release from 1991) that was Eric's backing band after the original members broke up.In fact, if I was to burn a CD-R of my favorite tracks from both of these CDs, the result would be this wonderful SACD hybrid from Abkco. The only thing missing is ""Dimples"" from ""The Singles Plus"" and ""Good Times"" from ""The Best Of...1966-68"". Otherwise, I'd be 5 stars.Recommended. Check it out."
5,Probably the only Animals album you need,"The Animals are one of my favorite bands from the 60's, and this is the only Animals album that I listen to now. It has pretty much every song even a fan would want. It is definetely, in my opinion at least, the best Animals compilation ever made."
2,Be careful... SACD layer is gone!,"The album ""Restrospective"" is NOT an SACD anymore! However the mfr Abkco has tried to ""hide"" that fact by not changing the cover and/or even the Part Number from when it WAS an SACD. As many know, record companies have spent large $$$ to remaster records for SACD high-def format, which was introduced around 2002. Unfortunately, due to slow sales they are no longer promoting this format, and Abkco took the dis-ingenuous step of deleting the SACD-layer from this formally Hybrid disc after just one year. Since about 2005, when you buy this (as well as Abkco's Stones discs) all you'll get is CD layer, as they've downgraded these products without telling buyers. A bad business practice for sure! Last, this record IS remastered so its CD sound is probably better than other Animals discs, but don't expect SACD (for that you need to find one produced from 2004-2005 on Ebay perhaps)."
3,Bit-rate lacking,I was excited to see the list of tracks offered in this collection. Most all their hits are here and a lot of great songs for Animals fans to dig into. However the bit-rate was 154 kbps (less than CD quality)on most songs and no bit-rate better than 175 kbps. I wish I would have bought the CD and ripped it myself. If you buy the CD this would be a five star collection. The low bit rate ruined this purchase for me! I wish you could return an MP3 Album!
2,"don't be fooled, most won't know!","what a great collection from an incredible band. I would have been very happy with this group of songs if they had been the original versions. I don't know what the reviewer (who claims to be a d.j.) is talking about, they are not the originals, I have most of them on 45's, (a collector). Why can't we buy a cd/album that is true to where it came from. I'd rather listen to clicks and pops than a sham! to bad people who don't know the difference are buying these albums and being mislead."
2,A little disappointed,"The service was fine but the product was not satisfactory. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the original album was this way (I think probably not) or whether this was some kind of remix or in-home production. But I ended up throwing the disk in the trash."
3,Great sounding CD.,"This CD sounds pretty good, except I thought it was an SACD. After checking closer it was just high-bit CD. The download version would have been just as good!"
4,surprising,"well worth the time and money. I think most people will find a couple of songs on this album, that they didn't remember as being from the animals."
3,Sent it back,"Gave this product three stars because it is indeed lightweight, as advertised, which is no small thing for me - a 4'11"" woman. Frankly it is barely middle of the road.After giving the bag a good lookover, I sent it back because it seems more like a $70 bag. The stitching is poorly executed, the material isn't great, the zipper pulls seem cheap, and the inside lining is kind of funky. The side handle isn't comfortable, and lastly, although the handle pulls out extra long, which is good for a tall person, you can't make it stay at the halfway point, so it isn't good for a short person.I ended up purchasing the Eagle Creek Tarmac ES 22 - yes more expensive, and 1.5 los heavier, but with many more features and a lifetime unconditional guarantee, it is a much better bang for the buck."
4,Excellent Ragtime recording,"This is an excellent ragtime recording for those who have an interest in ragtime or are just staring to experience it. This recording is essential Berlin, performed by the New York Pops. From the start, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" will get your fingers snapping and will stick with you the rest of the day. The music is timeless and will become a classic in your CD collection."
4,Excellent collection,"If you have any interest in ragtime, this is an excellent recording for your collection. the 1st track, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" is especially catchy, timeless, and finger-snappingly good (ha!). The CD gets better as it goes along and the music is complemented nicely by the outstanding performance by the New York Pops. new to ragtime music? pick this disc up and enjoy."
1,Shoud be Francis's Apology,"Is it not important to make history interesting to read? This book is so boring, misdirected and verbose I couldn't finish it. Rather than talk about the issues of the title, Francis spends more time going on and on about what Sewall had for dinner, what he paid for land, his romp through London and wars against Indians.I appreciate the accuracy and thoroughness of his research. But his inability to focus and put words together that are fun to read make this book painful."
3,Review of Small Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl,The bowl is fine. My mixer is set up for the bowl to lock and this bowl fits but does not lock. My order was handled very quickly and timely. I am happy about that. I am not unhappy with the bowl because it will do what I wanted but it would be nice if it would lock.Oster Small Stainless-Steel Bowl for Sunbeam & Oster Stand Mixers
4,would work ok for sunbeam 2591,Arrived on time. Although it does not fit my mix master's base. But i knew about this. I had done lot of research and figured out for my mixmaster model 2591 the small cup is not available. I saw the image on this vendors page and knew that the base will not fit. However one of the reviewer had said that it still can work. As the price was reasonable i took the risk. Now when i use it i just put it on the base and use it with my mix master. It does not fit but still works. no regrets.
2,bowl tom small,"The bowl seems to be good quality but is to small to work right on my mixer. The bottom fit properly but was to small to turn with the flow of the beaters. I was very disapointed as i have had the mixer for 40 years & the small bowl broke a long time ago, so was excited to have a new one. Oh well guess im stuck now."
1,This bowl DOES NOT FIT all Oster stand mixers,"This bowl, as stated in the description, DOES NOT FIT ALL OSTER STAND MIXERS!!!!I now have a useless mixing bowl, due to an inaccurate item description.Hopefully the seller will pay to send back, since they have posted a false description for this product."
5,Oster Kitchen center,"bought this for a 27 year old oster kitchen center my mom gave me. I broke the old glass bowl so decided to go stainless steel. I have had this now a few weeks and it is perfect, the bevel fits as good as the original bowl in the track. i use this every day to wisk my eggs for breakfast, i wash it by hand and let it dry. it shows water spots but thats it. this is a functional bowl stop whining about looks."
4,Good mixing bowl,"I bought this bowl to replace a glass bowl that I chipped. The bowl was for an Oster Kitchen Center which is no longer made. This bowl is sturdy and fits the turn table on my Kitchen Center. The only down side is that it is a little smaller than the bowl it replaced. On the plus side, being stainless steel, it should last forever."
1,mixing bowl,"I purchased a small mixing bowl that was to fit an Oster stand mixer. The bowl did not fit (turns out there is no such bowl, but this is being sold with the mixer). I called the company and they said to keep the bowl and they would credit my Amazon account. I contacted Amazon after the amount showed up on my card and was told my card would be credited within 10 business days. That was Feb. 9. I think the refund is over due."
1,Not for Heritage Series,The advertizer for this item on Amazon did not make it clear that while the item was for Oster & Sunbeam Stand Mixers it was NOT suitable for the Sunbeam Heritage Series.
2,Stick with the glass bowls.,"These stainless bowls never quite look clean. I don't where these are manufactured or exactly what the metal content properties consist of to manufacture these bowls. But for some reason the metal shows finger prints and discoloration no matter how well or how many times you wash it. I've only washed and dried mine by hand thus far. However, I'm rather hesitant to even put it in the dishwasher for fear that the metal could sustain severe permanent discoloration due to high temp washing and drying cycles.Do your self a favor. Get the glass replacement bowls. I wouldn't even use these stainless bowls for feeding my dog."
1,DOES NOT FIT SUNBEAM,I am unhappy! This bowl advertises to fit Sunbeam Stand Mixers. It does not! I bought it for a specific reason and when I opened it found out it would not fit.BUY BEWARE!
1,Does NOT fit Oster FPSTSM5102 Stand Mixer,Despite the description stating that it fits Oster Stand Mixers - it doesn't !!!.It does not fit the Oster FPSTSM5102 350-Watt 12-Speed All Metal Stand Mixer.The rotating ring on the mixer base and the metal base of the bowl are simply incompatible and make it impossible to use the bowl.Beware anybody reading the extremely misleading item description and believing it will fit this model of mixer.I am going to have to return the bowl.
5,The best tape I have ever bought!! Changed my body!!,I have exercised with Denise before but until I borrowed this tape from a friend I had started and stopped weight training repeatedly. I used this tape three times a week increasing the weights slightly as I could and in about a month there was significant muscle tone!! I couldn't believe it!! I knew I had to buy this tape and use it to continue to keep my new figure!!
3,Good for arms,"Like other reviewers have said, I agree this video is good for toning arms and will help your abs. However I dont feel there are enough toning exercises for anything below that!"
2,"Songs to much for grownups, not 13 year olds","On the song One Voice Billy is singing about his generation but as for the majority of the songs, they are for older singers who know what love is about. He has a teriffic voice and I do believe he will go far but he should of started out with songs of his generation. I wish him all the luck in the world and I'm glad I bought the CD but I do feel songs are to old for him. Kids are forced to grow up to soon these days and this is one example. Good Luck Billy!"
5,Awsome Single(s),I think that Billy's single(s)are really cool. His songs areboth catchy and meaningful. I can't wait for the CD to come out in June!
5,"Could it be, LeAnn Rimes reincarnated?","When I first saw the video to his ""One Voice"" single it took me a little while to figure out that the boy was the actual singer. Then it came to me. Wow! his voice it slightly high still, but whenever it changes I have a feeling he's going to ""Rock this country""! There has been such teen talent in country with women, but never really a boy. I have been waiting for a teen boy to burst into the country music scene. And it looks like Billy perfectly fits the description! Can't wait to hear what else he has to offer. I will make sure I pay attention to such a ""wonder""!"
5,Billy Gilman Is The Real Thing,Billy's music will grab your heart and not let go. His voice is incredible and his power is unbelieveable. Don't miss out buy all his CD's.
5,Billy Gilman is INCREDIBLE,"I, like many others, saw Billy Gilman on the ACM awards with Ray Benson & Asleep at the Wheel. He blew me away singing Rolly Poley. The first time I heard his song, One Voice, I had the TV on CMT in the middle of the night with my 4 month old son. I was asleep and my son was awake on my lap. It was one of those nights that he wouldn't go to sleep. This video came on and the voice was so incredible, I had to open my eyes to see who it was. I was surprised when I saw this 11 year old boy singing this incredible song. It put my son to sleep almost immediately. I bought the CD as soon as it was released. Each and every cut is wonderful. There are not many CDs released in which I like each and every song. This one I do. I keep the CD in my truck and when I am playing it and my son is in the truck, he always falls asleep. I can't wait for his next release."
1,Disgraceful,I am extremely disappointed to have found that the Author did not take the time to research some of the Persons named in the book. There is information which is incorrect which makes me wonder about all of the information given in the entire book. Permission was not given from myself or any of my family members mentioned in this book! The insinuations which are made are very disturbing to me and hurtful. The family members who we have tried for so long to protect are no longer protected. I find this to be disgraceful!
1,Constant Computer Crasher! Avoid!,"The graphics are stunning, but alas, this buggy software constantly crashes a brand new Pentium III 500 with an 18 meg 3D graphics card and 128 meg of SDRAM memory! It even refuses to run the uninstaller. A real disappointment for my child....and me."
3,"Nice Graphics, Fun Games!","I had no problems loading or playing this game. The kids like it...the cone game is similar to Frogger...and my son loves the robot game. There are three levels on every game, so all my kids can play at their own level. Overall, not as good as the original Toy Story games, but worth the money (especially after the rebate)."
1,Loser,"My 4 year-old (who is great at playing cd games) lost interest in 10 minutes. This is a badly designed game with minimal graphics and no story. There are a few games like ""print"" where you click on something and it prints...you don't even get to choose the character. The cone crossing game uses the arrow keys, not the mouse. And it crashes badly on the Mac. It is very un-Mac like. Too bad, we are such great fans of the movie. But save your money here."
4,Good overall product,"Keypad configuration can be a bit confusing, but overall a very good product. Cooks well, and looks clean in the kitchen. The sensor cooking feature works, surprisingly, very well. Definitely recommend this product."
2,"Good, but doesn't last","I bought one of these and absolutely loved it. Big, powerful, easy to use and excellent sensor performance. I was so happy with it that when, after 2 years - it started to act up (flash overs, circuit breakers blowing - pleasant) I figured it was a fluke and went out and bought another one. Well I guess they have a clock that tells them when to die because after 2 years this one started doing the exact same things and let me tell you, after seeing the lightning inside the microwave again (BTW no metal or foil) this one is on the way to be recycled and I'm waiting for my Panasonic."
5,Just what we hoped for!,"Our previous Sharp Carousel was the best microwave I had ever used, until this one! We love it and it is so very similar to our 10 year old model that fizzled out. Amazon made the shopping very easy and the price was excellent."
5,Sharp 2.0 cf microwave,"This microwave replaced an old Montgomery Wards brand we had since 1985 (and was still working, but slowly). The Sharp is like night and day -- everything gets done quickly, and the buttons for the individual types of food (warming rolls, defrosting meat, etc.) work perfectly, with the food coming out ready the first time."
1,Broke after 15 months,"Microwave is nice, except that it did not last more than 15 months. Was not used very much, so should have lasted many years. Will cost about $80 to repair the heating element, since only the part is covered under warranty, not labor. So much for cheap products from China! Not the cheapest solution in the long run when you have to spend $140 every year for a new microwave!!"
1,Weird Occurence,Bought it from Bestbuy about 18 months ago. Worked well until 2 days ago when it automatically starts whenever the door is opened. Kind of weird.
2,Lasted 19 months,"Product worked fine with very light use (1-2X/wk) for 19 months....then suddenly started sparking and shooting flames. To be fair, whilst researching other comments, it seems that this is a typical lifespan for current microwaves in this price range. My previous Panasonic unit lasted 12 years, so perhaps I have unreasonable expectations. However, points must be deducted for potential house fire, loss of all possessions, fiery death etc."
2,Consider Buying a Different Brand,My first microwave was a Litton which we used for 29 years. When we moved from our last house we left it there and it was still working fine.I bought this Sharp 4 years ago and was happy with it until this week. It has a smell of burning electrical components when it is turned on. I am no longer happy with it.I looked at a Consumer Reports from 2008 and they rated Sharp and Kitchen Aid as the least reliable microwaves on the market. I wish I had known that 4 years ago before I bought the Sharp. I bought a Kenmore today. I will be satisfied if it last at least 8 years.
3,Dimensions are Wrong (actually over 24 inches wide),Dimensions are Wrong (actually over 24 inches wide). We bought one of these for a 24 inch wide hole. The case is exactly 24 inches wide and the screws they used to attach case stick out a total of another 1/4 inch. It no fit took it back.
1,Auto Meter 2632 Z-Series Clock/Gauge,"The Clock face looks & functions great. The lighting in the clock is not capable of lighting the clock face. This clock was to replace an old Auto Meter clock that was no longer adjustable, the case & structure where easy to trade out. I am not sure why but the old clock illumination was good & the new one is pathetic. If this is a sample of Auto Meters current products I will need to find a new manufacturer for my future gauge needs."
1,Contains Very Little Information Specific To Embedded FreeBSD,"A complete waste of time and money. This book is misrepresented in what it claims to be about. It contains very little information specific to embedded FreeBSD.The author should have written much more about minimizing the kernel, limiting memory usage, device driver development, and flash storage issues - because these are the topics that are the most relevent to an embedded system. The discussion about using Tomcat, JSP, and JNI to provide web access to an embedded device - while important - is severely lacking.A good book about an embedded operating system will explore the problems and trade-offs that a systems developer will have to make. It would also discuss getting the OS to run on a single board computer - such as one of the devboards listed in the FreeBSD ARM project. This book does neither."
1,A great voice in a god-awful soundscape,"Byron has an extremely soulful voice that reminds me of the late Sylvester, and also former EWF lead Phillip Bailey. In this rendering by Johnny Vicious, Stingly's voice sounds alieniated. Techno is not this man's style. Disco maybe as in You Make Me Feel Mighty Real, but not what was done here."
5,INFO...,"Tales of the Heart V. 1 - Double Feature...CHALLENGE THE WIND: When a judge orders Matt to live with grandparents he's never known in a sleepy town, his only plans are for escape. Once on the farm, Matt comes to terms with his father's death in Vietnam, he also runs up against the school's best athlete and discovers that he himself can run! During training with his grandfather, Matt learns about much more than winning a race.CHOICES: A young man, skilled in both sports and music, faces a difficult decision when he is afflicted with a hearing impairment. A sensitive story of a young man struggling to adulthood."
4,Driving in Tuscany,This map helped us go to most of the places we planned in southern Tuscany. Smaller roads are mostly on the map. We used it extensively.
2,Small is not always best,"If you are serious about driving through Tuscany, you will need something more than this map, which is pretty basic. Fine if you intend to travel only on the autostrade and other main roads, but one of the joys of driving in this region is finding small roads, sometimes unpaved, which can lead to small medieval hamlets (known as 'borghe')that have remained basically unchanged for centuries.There are a number of excellent maps produced but in my many travels in Italy, I have always found the maps produced by the Touring Club Italiano (TCI), and distinguished by the bright green cover with the TCI logo, to be unfailingly brilliant. Difficult to find in this country, they are widely available at gas stations, newsstands, and the like, in Italy."
4,Better than the GPS!,"We tend to take the roads ""less traveled by"" when on vacation. Although every road we traveled in Tuscany was not on this map, it was most helpful in establishing our general location. (The GPS could not do that at times.) We were ""misplaced"" sometimes, but never lost! I""m glad we had this map with us."
5,helpful map of Tuscany,"I love these streetwise maps. They make travel so easy. Small enough to keep on your lap, so you don't have to unfold and refold a bulky travel road map. Not as detailed, but there aren't so many streets in Tuscany that that issue presents a problem."
1,Tuscany street map,This map is not very helpful if you need city street names. Only good for major highways and cities. Wouldn't recommend it.
5,Very pleased with this product,I am very pleased with this product. I recently purchased an HP printer that has the capability of direct media printing. This is my first experience with printable media. I am very happy with my choice of this particular product. I would highly recommend it.
5,Compatible with older (slower) devices,"I needed DVDs for my Sony DVD / VCR Burner that were 8x or slower. These are the only ones I could find anywhere, and they work perfectly. If you have a burner that requires a slower x-factor disc, these should certainly do the trick."
4,Verbatim white inkjet printable DVD,Printed several and the quality was as good or better than the Memorex ones used previously. The white print surface extends much closer to the center opening and allows for a larger footprint. The only potential drawback for me is to make sure the graphics around the circle look decent. The best is saved for last which is the price was right.
5,Simply awesome...,"Not much else I can say about this product; I've used it on my desktop's burner and a set-top recorder, and I've never made a coaster.I highly recommend them!"
1,High failure rate compared to the shiny-surface version,"I highly recommend the shiny-surface version of the Verbatim DataLifePlus disks over these white-coated ones. As far as I know they should be idetical except for that shiny vs. white surface difference, but I have bought at least three 50-pack spindles of the shiny version and have encountered maybe one or two bad disks. My 50-pack of the white ones, on the other hand, had at least 10 bad disks according to two separate DVD-recording devices. I wondered if both my devices happened to be going bad at the same time but since switching back to the shiny version I have yet to encounter another bad disk."
4,Good So Far,"The first two didn't copy, but that might have been a glitch somewhere else in the process. Since then its been good so far."
3,Some what disappointed.,"For some reason I can only burn at 4x on my Pioneer DVR-111 with 1.29 firmware (latest). I used to work for a duplication company and always liked Verbatim, so this was a bit disappointing. Maybe I'll go back to Taiyo Yuden which doesn't have the reputation of Verbatim but seems to be at least as good in practice."
1,Not good,I bought this to create back up of my movies and I was very disappointed to see that movies that I copied were playing with glitches. I asked for a replacement thinking that it might be the problem with this item but even the repalcement dvd's also had same problem. I returned the item and bought HP printable DVD's from walamrt for $26 and it worked prefectly fine. I dont recommend this to anyone.
1,Nearly every disk defective,"Normally, I think of Verbatim as one of the better brands for blank media. However, nearly every disk in this spindle purchased from Amazon was defective. The flaw in the media could be seen as an empty circle when looking at the bottom of the disk. Poor quality control."
1,not worth the price,These Disks are not worth the price. Almost one out of two disks would have burn issues or would not complete the burning process on my DVD software also they had problems playing on some dvd players where at least one of the dvd players i think had no problem playing a dvd i made a year ago from another type of dvd.I woudnt get this. the white space is nice but its not to me worth the price dunno why it got such high ratings.
1,Unhappy results,I recently purchased this item and found out that it's ture you get what you pay for.Saving a couple of bucks is not worth it. The disk I received will stop about half way into the burn process and give you some type of error report that I have never seen. I tried 4 times thinking I had 1 bad disk but nooooo. I would not recommend these to anybody. Hopefully they will make nice Christmas tree decoration next year.
5,DVD review,"Use these DVD's for my TV ministry and the ability to 'paint' my label on them is a great witnessing tool. Have you accepted Christ Jesus as Lord and Savior today? If not, just pray...Jesus I accept you as my Lord and Savior. Amen. Now find a good Bible Believing Church and know you have the Peace which passes all understanding though Christ Jesus!"
3,Actually I see less power pop style....,"First of all I am not going to come out and say this is a bad album. It is charming in it's own way. However compared to the first album it's a bit darker, depressing and a bit too reflective for my taste. The first album was filled with fun pop melodies while this has just a few that stand out. The musicianship in both albums is incredible, but this one does not grab my attention immediately. I was hooked on the first album after 1 30 sec. clip on this site.The last 4 tracks show the fun that the first album have. It's too bad it just seems like a big reflective storytelling album. Commercial yes, but spectacular..no I'm afraid not. Listening to this just gets me mellow...that's all."
4,Close... but not quite Owsley - Owsley,"This guy is a player, he writes great hooks, and this album is very well done. I may have been spoiled by Owsley - Owsley. Had I heard The Hard Way first, I may have a reversed opinion. Maybe just not enough new sound to this to give it the 5 stars. But you won't be disappointed in it, just might not blow your hair all the way off."
2,Killed by over-processing,"Man, what is it with these guys? Owsley writes great songs, arranges and plays them well. Then he has to ruin it all by putting on this auto-pitch-correction software that snaps his vocals perfectly to pitch. Unfortunately it also leaves these weird warbly artifacts in the recording so it sounds like a machine instead of a person singing.Look we'll forgive you the occasional sour note, but how about just letting your God given abilities shine through and leave the pitch correction software off, huh? It just killed an otherwise great album for me!"
4,Relive the magic!,"For anyone searching to recapture the mystery of this fantastic musical, this very well may be the book for you! While it is more of a picture walk-through of Cats than an in-depth look behind the scenes, it serves its purpose in capturing this Broadway monster on paper!"
5,For CAT lovers everywhere!,"My child is a huge fan of the musical CATS and I bought this book for him so he could have pictures of all of his favorite characters. He loves this book and I found it definitely worth the price! The pictures are beautifully done, the colors are vibrant and it's a great companion to the CATS video that we already own. I definitely reccomend this for CATS fans!"
3,This cat thinks This Book has been overrated,"I loved the stage musical and didn't understand a word except for ""Memories"". And I love the video to death. But this book is no way a companion to the video, unless you're just looking for the words to the songs. In that case you've spent way too much (the lyrics can be had on the WEB)! The cast in this book is different than the Video and if you have young kids who love the video like mine do, they are going to ask (and say)""Why daddy does Gus look different, or that's not Gus"". The only worth while text is from Andrew Llyod Webber and it happens to be the shortest article of the 4 included. I was disappointed to say the least and in hind sight find that 99% of the reviews are ""irrationally"" positive and not at all realistic."
2,Is this the only book about CATS! the musical?,"I read a review that said the pictures were crisp. I ordered the book and found the pictures to be blurry and unprofessional. They look like they were taken from the front row during a performance with the wrong film speed and light setting on the camera. I was very disappointed with the pictures and overall quality of the book. This is not a high quality book of the musical, but I can't seem to find any other book about the broadway musical that contains pictures. Too bad."
5,This book transformed my writing and now helps me help those I teach,"Best book I've ever read on how to improve your writing skills! I use this book all the time in my seminars, workshops, and private coaching to help my students (biomedical researchers and life scientists) become better communicators. It's a terrific resource for people in all professional disciplines because it shows the reader not just how to write clear compelling documents but also how to spot (and articulate) the problems in poorly written text."
3,Nice color but not bright,"The light bulb has a nice color which works alright for my small room that i have it in, but it is not very bright at all and doesnt illuminate the room in red light as i hoped, it more has a glow of red that comes from the light and is faintly visible throughout the room"
5,A highly accurate collection of classic Roman Mythology excerpts in Latin,"Enhanced with illustrations from Christopher J. White, Latina Mythica by Bonnie A Catto (Professor of Classics, Assumption College, Worcester, Massachusetts) is a highly accurate collection of classic Roman Mythology excerpts in Latin. Inclusive of grammar and comprehension questions, discussion questions, cultural influences of each myth in art, music, ballet, and literature, ten original black and white illustrations, map of place names mentioned in the myths, genealogical charts, list of ancient sources cited, bibliography, and an end vocabulary, Latina Mythica is a superb learning tool, and very strongly recommended for all students of the Latin language, as well as Roman culture and myth. Also strongly commended to Latin Studies collections is Professor Catto's earlier work, Lucretius: Selections From De Rerum Natura."
1,The title of the book is mis-leading...,"I was expecting to get a book that had practical advice for turning a two income family into one. Instead the book didn't contain many practical ideas and was filled with a heavy pro-christian agenda. I never realized that I could use giving children piano lessons as a method of not only picking up extra income, but I could turn it into an opportunity to covert children into my belief system. While I'm by no means anti-christian, the book doesn't help deal with many of the day to day lessons and issues that many of us face with making such a tough, and personal choice. To sum up the book, the lesson is that God will provide, which many of us are aware of from our Bible teachings. If you're looking for a handbook with good lessons, skip this book. If you're intersted in a sermon, this is the perfect book for you."
2,Decision to Stay at Home is Assumed,"I did not find this book to be helpful in making my decision to stay at home. It seems to assume that everyone would make that decision given the financial stability necessary to do so. While it is based on Christian values, it often does so at the expense of sensibility, i.e., cashing out your 401K to stay at home. Even as a Christian, I found the biblical references a bit much.This book is probably beneficial if you are have already decided you want to stay at home and are looking for strategies and advice on how to facilitate your choice."
1,Vague and Too Religious,"I'm very disappointed in this book. First, the entire thing has very strong Christian overtones, and I happen to follow a non-Christian religion. I also find advice like ""Trust in God, God is the Ultimate Money Manager"" unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst. God helps those who help themselves! Now, there's nothing wrong with that if it's what you were looking for, but this was reviewed as a practical guide, not a spiritual one!Even beyond that, much of the advice is vague and a lot of it is devoted to anecdotes from stay-at-home moms and their husbands about how much better life is and how much happier their children are since the transition.As a woman contemplating motherhood and cutting my hours down severely, I was looking for a sensible guide to managing finances with clear advice and sample numbers of budgets from families who have successfully done the same thing. This is not that book."
4,Stop complaining about this being a 'religious' book,I don't understand the complaints about this being a Christian book. There are probably 30 times as many books out there that are non-religious as there are religious. Maybe you should have done some research before buying the book.
2,Too much of a Christian Agenda,"This book should come with a warning label alerting readers to Gochnauer's Christian agenda. I wanted a straightforward, ""how-to"" book and what I got was a heavy-handed sermon (complete with cited Biblical references) which got old quick. This works for her, apparently, but I obviously do not share her simplistic philosophy. She even goes so far as to say she debates Darwinism in favor of Creationism! Be careful if you don't share these views - there is nothing in the descriptions to alert you before you buy. If you really want to have a better plan than ""God will provide"" before you quit your job, check out ""Miserly Moms"" by Jonni McCoy for a better, more practical guide, or ""You Can Afford to Stay Home with Your Kids"" by Malia McCawley Wyckoff and Mary Snyder."
5,Great Advice From One Who's Been There!,"This book is great for if you're thinking about either cutting back your hours or staying home full-time with your kids. The author has been in your shoes, and gives some wonderful advice. It's so nice to know that you're not alone, and to receive guidance from someone so wise and experienced. The book's an easy read, and very well laid out. Also, I want to stress that this book is nonjudgmental about people who ARE currently working full-time. The book's meant to be a supportive resource, not a condemnation to full-timers (as some other similar books I've read can seem). In closing, I highly recommend this books!"
4,Spurgeon on Spurgeon,"Banner of Truth Trust released this revised edition of Spurgeon's Autobiography, which originally appeared in four volumes. Having completed volume one of the now two volume set, I can say without hesitation that my respect and admiration of this great man of God has grown even greater. While any autobiography lacks the continuity of a well-researched biography, there is a freshness to it that is endearing. Spurgeon relates anecdote-like memories, along with detailed descriptions of some of the more pertinent events of his life. The chapters dealing with his conviction of sin and subsequent conversion are especially enlightening. Susannah Spurgeon wrote several chapters that are also included - mostly about their courtship and early wedded life. This volume deals mainly with Spurgeon's childhood and early ministry with the New Park Street Baptist Church, and it is not without some of Spurgeon's own humor. Very good indeed!"
4,Mayberry's one of the best.,"Likable heroine; the hero had an ego that needed puncturing, though.I felt for the heroine, feeling like an Ugly Duckling, and despised her parents (and siblings) for the way they treated her. I much preferred her ""chosen sisters"" instead.Hello? When one sibling stabs another in the back, a parent needs to step up and TELL the betrayER that her behavior is NOT ACCEPTABLE. They should NOT expect the betrayed one that she has to make peace because the betrayer is faaammmiiilllyyy!"
1,RUN!!!,"This is another knock-off album not clearly advertised as such. When I received the CD, I read the fine print on the back which states ""Includes New Stereo Recordings by the Original Artists."" Such information should be provided in the on-line product desciption so that a buyer can decided if he or she wants the original songs or re-makes BEFORE making the purchase."
5,Creative techniques beyond Polymer Clay 101,"This is a wonderful helpful book for anyone wanting to take a step forward in using this versatile medium. It is heavy on artistic applications, and the projects are richly elegant. She has shared some hints for working with some of the more intriguing methods of handling the clay.The best part for me was the compared methods of doing various techniques, i.e. monkume gane.While it gives a good description of what polymer clay is and lists the items one may use to work with it, it probably is not a good choice for a first PC book, as a lot of the basics are not detailed nor illustrated. However, for those who want to polish their techniques or need a kickstart for a new ideas, it is a real winner."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is true that it includes many exciting techniques, but the instructions are very poorly written (including editing mistakes and typographical errors) and frequently less than helpful.Some of the editing choices that were made were questionable. For example, on one page there is an image of an (admittedly lovely) brooch and another ""detail"" photograph of the same brooch--only the ""detail"" picture is only slightly larger than the original and therefore doesn't add any extra information.The artwork selected is also disappointing. I found the majority of the pieces to be somewhat unsophisticated. While there are several notable exceptions, on the whole this book failed to inspire.In short, there are many excellent books on polymer clay already, and more are being printed every day. Pass this one over."
4,High Quality Book,"I think Point of Impact or Black Light was better books, but he defiantly has a good one here also. He just produces wonderful character driven stories that when they work (and this one does), they really grab you. The tension is there though out the full book. The story is very developed so much so that you see the missile silo, the room the main character is working in etc. Another thing about his books is that they do not play to the lowest common denominator for action books; he gives the reader some respect and expects an IQ over 70. A good book that is worth the time."
3,Too Much,"I always read the reviews before buying a book. I have read all of the Hunter novels and have liked all of them. This book just had too much going on. I found it hard to follow. As I have finished it and think back on it, I enjoyed the parts I did understand. I think it will be a re-read for me in the future."
4,Day Before Midnight(Stephen Hunter),"Another excellent,early thriller by the total master of them all.'though it isn't in the category of some of the Swagger novels,it is, nothingless,a great read.Entertaining,exciting,and because of some of the recent disasters that have befallen this country,highly believable."
4,"Fake, but good.","I find this book difficult to rate, as it is incredibly fake. The way the military acted and reacted in this book is so over militarized and cheesy, it is not even funny. However, the story is very good. The characters are magnetically interesting, and, as you read along, it gets harder and harder to stop. The plot develops quickly and winds up with an incredibly tense ending. If you are current or ex-military, expect a good laugh, and a good read. If you are not, expect a good read anyway"
3,Haven't I seen this movie before?,"I picked up this novel last night in my trek through all of Hunter's Swagger novels.First mistake. This book does not involve either Bob Lee or Earl. Unrelated in any way.Nevertheless, it seems to be a good read, but the whole story line seems to be a ripoff of ""The Rock"". I'm not sure if this was written before that movie was done or vice versa, but there seems to be an analog for every character so far.My other nit is his attention to detail is lacking. He says in one place the payload of the missile is 35 MEGAtons, and in another 35 KILOtons. How could his editors not catch that? This deficiency is consistent. Just finished ""Havana"", and he makes an error in an address which is very critical to the story.As I said above, I'll finish this one; it is a good read. But if I had it to do over, I would probably pass."
2,One implausibility after another,"Full of stereotypes, stock characters, mindless violence, and worst--a plot that turns on really stupid decisions by the major players. A big disappointment. Not in the same class as Point of Impact which has a riviting plot, great characters, believable dialogue, and violence that moves the story forward--not just violence for the sake of blowing stuff up and people away."
3,Good read,"Good book. Stephen Hunter is one of my favorite as authors. Not a Bob Lee Swagger novel, but good just the same"
3,eh...,"the wires are really messy and the sound quality is not that great with higher music volume. not bad for the price. recommended for confined spaces in quiet areas, but not for loud music"
4,ipod docking speakers,"This is such a cute little unit, and is exactly what I needed/wanted. It doesn't have the greatest quality sound and can't get very loud, but it's perfect for my needs. A good value for the money."
1,Dissatisfied,"The product didn't work! Never worked. As they say, I guess you get what you pay for! Never will shop at this place again!"
5,Grab this used or anyway you can,"I agree with everything said by every other reviewer. ""All Those Christmas Cliches"" can move me to tears -- through my smiles -- in August. Not to be missed."
5,Give This CD To Your Friends For Xmas,Five stars could easily be raised to the tenth power for this singer who's phrasing of I SAW THREE SHIPS offers a range of dynamics and tempo other singers will not attempt. That's just the start. This is an Xmas recording for people who don't want yet another traditional song and performance offering. Give this recording as a gift and friends will hear a new sound for the season by a voice they will never forget. Had Nancy made volume two and three I would have been in line to purchase those as well.
5,just in time for christmas,"The late Nancy Lamott had the voice of a lifetime. I own multiple copies of all her cds and the dvd of her all too few live performances. She truly was one of the best interpreters of the Great American Songbook. Every time I listen to one of her CDs (every day) I smile. Her Christmas CD is the best I own. I buy a few new ones every year to give as gifts to be sure that everyone I know gets to listen to this beautiful voice and that her voice goes on and is not forgotten. Love you always, Nancy."
5,"This is a CD for all seasons, all reasons!","I had first heard a cut from this CD ""I Saw Three Ships/Bring A Torch Jeannette, Isabella"" on Jonathan Schwartz's Christmas show on WNYC last season. I was crying tears of joy - seldom have I heard such a life-affirming song - and how sadly ironic given its source! Everything on this CD accomplishes the impossible - smart, sophisticated, yet sentimental. It lies on my seasonal Christmas tray - along with James Galway's ""In Dulci Jubilo"", Vince Guraldi's ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and Ralph Vaughn-Williams' ""Hodie and Fantasia on Christmas Carols"". But unlike these other fine works - I play Nancy's ""Just in Time"" all year long!"
4,Nice red tulip chair - hard to put together right,"Beautiful and comfortable stool, but I was ready to return it only an hour after it had arrived. The package directions for assembling it were very poor and the seat did not lift with the gas-powered lever as it was supposed to. Turns out the directions left out an important key point about removing an end-cap object on the gas cylinder. I am not a mechanic. If my brother had not been so familiar already with mechanical chairs powered by gas cylinders (he's a school custodian), I would have returned the whole thing, unassembled, to the manufacturer. Luckily, my brother figured out how to assemble it properly.The seller did not have a way to contact them after hours or on the weekend. They were pleasant and helpful on Monday morning, but I'd received the chair late afternoon on a Friday and could not figure out what was wrong with it. Now it is fine."
4,Not A Millionaire Yet...,"...but on the other hand, I haven't bought my first property yet. What I'll grade on is readability, timeliness, and feasibility. Mrs. Z obviously knows her real estate, and I never thought about living in the property first before you make it a rental. Makes sense, why rent out to someone else a house you wouldn't want to live in yourself? I give her high marks for the checklist to go through for in searching properties, and she recognizes the fact that not all of us WANT to be millionaires. It's a very readable book that doesn't get lost in jargon, but doesn't ignore the terminology a real estate investor is going to need, either. I also found the analogy for shopping for a house/husband very cute. I'm leery of the more creative financing ploys, though. I think her method is doable, but I'd also investigate the book Rental Houses for the Successful Small Investor by Suzanne Thomas and then compare the two outlooks."
5,A great book for women who are new to the real estate game.,"This book is excellent for single women who want to secure their financial future without tying up all of their available liquid assests today. The author clearly shows how good judgement and elbow grease can help you work for a secure retirement. By utilizing capabilities that all of us have, we can make our money go further and still maintain a comfortable cash flow. The statistics on women living below the poverty level after retirement are staggering. With the information in this book, it is possible not to fall into that category."
4,A great place to start in the real estate investing business.,"This is my ""baby"" book. I literally cut my entrepreneurial teeth on this one. If you are looking for a simple direct plan for retiring with $1m without changing your whole life, this is it. Thank you Elaine"
1,Could not use Product,"After I received this Cd I promptly went to the computer to download the game for my son, I was told that the CD could not be downloaded due to copy right issues. It was a waste of my money."
1,seizure,I purchased this game and wanted to give a warning to parents. It may have caused my daughter to have a seizure. There is a game where you can draw pictures using dots. Those dots can be animated to blink/flash and change colors very quickly. My daughter who has never had any medical problems played this game and went in to a seizure. This is the only thing that we can think of that could have caused it since ALL of her tests came back normal and that is what she was doing when the seizure happened. With all of the other games out on the market I would pass this one by and pick something else.
3,Great guide -- if you have a magnifying glass,"This is a wonderful compendium of information on cycling in France -- but alas, it it is frustrating to read through all the great sections because of the very small type. I wish there was a Kindle version, and then I could see it on my iPad Kindle ap so much more easily. It is a shame that such a great guide is counter to that intent. What good is a guide that is hard to read?"
2,"Out of date, but good basic information","I've done 20 bike trips in France. I loved this book at first, but now is totally out of date and desperately needs a re-do. The first pages of general information about customs, train travel, history, language, cycling culture, etc are great. However, the rest of the book is filled with routes and acomodations that no longer exist and missing many many new routes that have come along in the past decade. For example, cycling along the Loire River is superb along the new EuroVelo6 bike route that did not exist at the time of this book's publication in 2001. It's a paved signed path along The Loire hundreds of miles long and totally separate from cars. France is promoting cycle tourism like crazy, but there is lots of new stuff to know. You can't put a bike on a TGV train for example unless you know the secrets to train travel. Lonely Planet . . . fresh edition PLEASE."
4,your own tour de france,"With this book, you find the most interesting roads to ride on. In addition, you will also find nice stories of professionals who ride these roads - experiences on what to do & what NOT to do. So, whether you come to france, or stay at home, with this book, you'll have your own tour de france in your room!"
2,"Very little Performance, very little detail","Don't expect to find many actual performance projects in this book. For instance, there is nothing on fuel or intake systems. The performance projects it does have are very limited in detail. The wheel alignment chapter basically tells you how awesome it is to have a performance wheel alignment, ""here are the specs you want, take them to your alignment shop"". The majority of the book is basic repairs that are covered better in other books such as my favorite ""MX-5 Miata Enthusiast's Workshop Manual"". But if you want to pretty up your car, the author goes into detail about how to install custom dash faces and how to put stripes on your car. Give me a break. This book is a disappointment."
4,Brake Info NOT Accurate,"I have completed nearly half of the project in the book with great success. Instructions are usually right on and he makes upgrades and maintenance accessible to this amature mechanic.HOWEVER, for the 2002 Miata NB, the information about the rear brakes is woefully inadequate. There is an adjustment screw in the rear brakes that the book mentions only in passing with little explanation as to what it is for. After and hour of nearly destroying my calipers trying to get the pistons back into them, I went online and found that the adjustment screw is of vital importance when changing the brakes of the Miata LS. You must back the screw out and the piston follows. If he had just put that simple sentence into the book I would have completed my driveway brake job in an hour without the additional stress and time."
2,Miata Mx 5 Performance Projects,"Great illustrations and the written explanations are clear, but the book's range of performance projects is rather limited. In particular, there was a very limited list of engine enhancements although the section on suspension and brakes is good."
1,For very basic information only,"I do not know what book these others read but this is a elemental ""See spot run"" type of book. I am a retired certified automobile mechanic and owned my own shop for over 10 years. I also have been repairing and modifying my own cars for over 40 years. I bought the book to find some special trick projects not to find out how to change my brakes or timing belt. I own a 1995 MX-5 and completely rebuilt the motor and transmission doing the headwork myself as to porting polishing Hypo Wisco pistons, supercharger, computer enhancements, and much more. Trust me I know how to change the oil which this book dedicates a whole performance chapter to. If anyone wants a book I will give mine away for free if you want to pick it up."
4,Not for beginners...,"This book is a great start to give ideas to Miata owners of the enhancement potential of their cars. The book assumes a good fundamental knowledge of cars and starts from that base. The projects range from the mild to the wild - yet always staying within the property of enhancing the Miata; not turning it into what it is not. Miata enthusiasts will find the book a delight to read, even if none of the projects are done. Well-written, easy to follow, and the author does a good job of encouraging owners to take that first step to personalize this beautiful car."
2,Lacking content,"I bought this book expecting great things from Keith Tanner, after reading many of his insights on Miata.net. This book might be a good introduction to a new Miata owner, but it leaves a lot out that is covered in the Miata Performance Handbook by Norm Garrett."
1,Ouch,"The ones giving this one 5 stars must be starving for entertainment...All I can say is... as soon as I got my copy from a seller on Ebay, I listened to it once and then planned immediately to re-list to see if I could unload it on someone else... Just listen to the Raspberries originals and please don't subject yourself to this one!"
3,Not surprised . . .,"First, I love Phillip Margolin. Second, I was not surprised that the book had a different slant as a thriller. Mr. Margolin has made me a true fan . . . but this one, at least for me, simply had too many characters to keep up with. I found myself flipping back through the book to find out who some one was. Overall, it's not one of his best, but well worth reading."
2,I am not sure about this one!,"Normally, I really enjoy a good Margolin story, but this one was lacking. I would have given the novel a 2.5, and I was not so moved to give it a 3. I loved some of the story, but most of it was silly. I work in law enforcement and deal with cold cases, so the whole evidence tampering was possible, but I thought the motive was silly. If someone did manufacture evidence, I don't think it would have happened like this. I thought that the Crime Scene Tech who began initially committing perjury because he believed the people were guilty, but he definately stepped over the line when he killed Mary, his partner. I think the fact that Amanda Jaffe and her father appeared was one of the most redeeming factors in the novel, but overall, I thought that it was lacking."
4,Great Read,"While there's no mystery to be solved, the real mystery is just how long it'll take for everyone to figure out what's going on -- and that's what kept me turning the pages.The one thing that really bugged me though was the relationship between Amanda and Mike which seemed to move at warp speed. One minute she's lamenting to herself about being alone...the next she's accepting a date from Mike...the next they're suddenly in love. It was unrealistic and I really couldn't care less about them because of it."
2,Proof of Lazy Writing,"What a lazy and poorly written book for a writer who has been so thrilling in his previous novels. I cared so little for the ""good guys"" that the ""evil"" medical examiner was not fearful. The head of the mob and his henchman seemed far worse - torturing, etc.It should come as no surprise that not all readers are going to root for Frank, the boring mob lawyer and his self righteous daughter who are defending characters that are uninteresting. I never was made to feel anxious on their behalf. Breach, the poorly dressed, sadistic mob boss acts like Amanda is his god-daughter or something. There is something very wrong with that. I don't care if his henchman, Prochaska, is wrongfully convicted anyway.For Frank and Amanda to be worth rooting for you need a truly hideous ""bad guy"" as was the case in Wild Justice. On their own, they are not intersting or vulnerable enough to make us worry about their cases especially with such uninteresting clients."
2,Can't imagine why he is a best selling author,"The writing here just does not live up to other authors such as Connelly, Sandford, Martini, etc. The story seems weak to me. Portland is not that big of a city and yet when a criminalist and an attorney are murdered others in the legal community either barely knew of it or seemed rather unconcerned. If the attorney you were working with on a big case gets murdered, you would most likely talk about it as the first subject with everyone you know.None of the characters were well developed or made you care about them. No tension, no drama, nothing to think about as you pretty much knew it all early on. Except of course why am I reading this."
3,Just OK,"The handling - and mishandling - of forensic evidence take center stage in Proof Positive. Evidence tampering, wrongful convictions and executions, and flagrant cover-ups converge to destroy lives, and the perpetrator of all this mayhem is supposed to be one of the good guys. When a co-worker becomes suspicious, he stops at nothing to preserve his own reputation and career.Author Margolin fields a huge cast of characters in this novel, which occasionally causes confusion. The pace is brisk, but some of the feats accomplished by the antagonist verge on the implausible. None of the characters are particularly well developed, but if you enjoy plot-driven legal thrillers, Proof Positive is entertaining enough."
2,Sad to see this good author write so badly,"As with the other two-star reviewers, I have to reluctantly agree that this is a pretty poor book, very badly written and with a ridiculous unbelievable plot and one-dimensional characters.As I have enjoyed other of his books, I can't imagine what got into him to produce such a shabbily-written book. Was he strapped for money, half-drunk, or just not caring when he churned out this terrible tome?It was difficult to finish it, and when I did I could only wonder why I bothered."
4,Review of proof positive,"Good book. Held my interest throughout. Had a good combination of suspense, romance and action. I have read several of Mr Margolin,s books and have enjoyed them all."
2,Proof Positive of why I don't read this genre,"I do enjoy a good crime/CSI type read every now and then, but this was not one of those. This author was touted as "" a master of plot and pacing"", and it was said he ""knows how to pack in the thrills"". Well, if he does, it certainly did not show in Proof Positive.From very early on, it was painfully obvious what was going to happen, and who would be doing it. But I kept reading, thinking I was just getting ahead of myself and seeing the simpler side of things, and that the twists and turns were coming soon. They didn't. A second grader could have read this and told you the outcome by the third chapter.There are no surprises, no twists, and ultimately, no joy from this book. Bland beyond measure, I found this book absolutely boring and witless. Third grade reading level readers will enjoy this predictable, cookie cutter book. I did not."
2,An unrealistic defense-attorney fantasy,"Having read several of Mr. Margolin's previous books, I found this story much weaker than the other stories, and so implausible as to be exasperating. This is a defense attorney's silly fantasy in which all defendants in the account (at least five distinct legal proceedings) are actually innocent; they are only being prosecuted because of craven malice on the part of the police, the DA's office and the criminalist. Granted that the villain is falsifying evidence, you would think that at least in SOME of the cases the defendants would actually have committed the crimes of which they have been accused."
4,Another conformity breaking ear-raping success.,"If you're into goth, metal, and Anarchy this album is great! Better than before (thought not as good as it could be.) Wanna scare the neighbors? Crank up the stereo!"
5,The Gods of Dark-Goth-Romantic rule supreme!,"Even better than ""The Angel and the Dark River"". Aaron's vocals are better, the guitars are heavier & it's even DARKER!! ""The Dark Caress"" is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever written! The violin passages are hypnotically beautiful! The song ""For You"" is so moving, poetic & romantic, that tears will surely swell your eyes! The lyrics to ""A Kiss To Remember"" are true Vampiric Ecstasy!! Absolutely incredible!!"
5,Timeless Lyrics,"This album may be one of the hidden jewels of the music industry. Curtis Mayfield is absolutely brilliant with his arrangements here. ""Back To The World"" is a poetic statement of the soldier returning home from war."
5,His Best,I played this album on the air at Utapao Royal Thai Naval Air Force Base in 1973 and 1974 over the American Forces Radio and Television station. Most of us knew this album because it was about a Vietnam Vet coming back to the States. Curtis Mayfield was a great musician and a wonderful human being. He is missed.
3,Not quite hitting the mark,"Short story anthologies are hard to judge. The book promises ""Twenty shocking stories starring twenty edgy, outrageous and badly behaved heroines"".It doesn't quite hit the mark. Some stories have great characters - often to be found in full length books of their own and these work the best. The rest have characters which never develop and which leads to flat stories.It is best read as an introduction to the Authors and their main characters."
2,Disappointing,"A few of these stories are easy reading, but most seem unneccesarily violent and shocking. It's worth the price for the three or four decent stories. I enjoyed the stories by Jenny Colgan, Jen Banbury and Laura Lippman and Sparkle Hayter's story was light fun if not exactly ""tart noir."" You take your chances with the quality of the rest."
3,The feminists' legacy?,"Tart Noir is a crime anthology starring tough and sexy women who get away with crime. I thought I'd find a clever collection of short crime stories with strong female characters. I was deeply disappointed. The authors explored the tartness in their characters, but I was more interested in what the book had promised: noir stories with a feminist touch. Isn't the title supposed to be ironic? Apparently, it isn't. Alas, there are some nice short stories to indulge in. The ones written by Jessica Adams, Lisa Cody, Lisa Jewell and Jenny Colgan are worth reading. Overall, however, this book and its editors (Stella Duffy and Lauren Henderson) leave a lot to be desired."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was full of expectations but significantly disappointed by this DVD. Why can't the makers at least allow one full song to be sung? Instead, a teasing, 20+ seconds of her magnificent Lincoln Memorial concert is played, followed by numerous, adoring commentaries by a narrator and obviously many people who knew her or studied her. This is a complete waste of money for those who want to hear her music. I didn't want to listen to them; I wanted to listen to her."
5,A TOTAL mystery...,"...and I hope he stays that way. Francis Ford Coppola is one of the inspirations of my life. His energy and enthusiasm for what he does outshines even the projects many might deride. One thing you have to say is at LEAST he puts his all into what he does, and I'd imagine no one would doubt this. PS: WHEN is the UNCUT version of ""One From the Heart"" going to be issued on DVD?"
1,sad to see an old friend die,"For many years I have enjoyed reading Garfield. He was always one of my favorite characters and I own many of his early books.In his latest books (including the 26th) I noticed that the strips seemed different. They weren't as fun to read. They were missing something. Recently I found out what that 'something' was.Being a big fan of comic strips, I bought a book that told about the strips and also about the cartoonist. I read in that book that Jim Davis no longer draws his own strip any more. He now hires someone else to draw it. He still supplies the ideas, but he is now concentrating on turning the strip into an advertisement for Garfield products.The missing part? The strip no longer has a soul. Mr. Davis sold it to a T-shirt company.It is hard for me to understand how someone could do something like that to his own creation."
4,Cub luster's take note,"I had this book recommended to me, because I am looking for a Cub Lo-Boy to mow a few acres of lawn. I didn't know a Cub from a Lo-boy Cub from a Numbered Series Lo-boy. This book lays out the history, as well as the specifications of the different years and series. I also contains serial number listings of each year series and corrolates them to the equipment and specs for that year. I'm well pleased and it has made me much more aware of what to look for as I scour the countryside in search of my new ride! I am not interested in the Cub Cadet portion, but it has a lot of good pictures and covers a couple chapters, so I'm sure you'd find some good info there, as well..."
4,PUZZLE LADY AGAIN,"It is a tradition for me to read a Puzzle Lady book every year. This one I enjoyed. Sometimes I read the Puzzle Lady mysteries and I hope that the media finds out that she isn't really the puzzle lady, and that her niece is the true puzzle lady. Then the books would be titled Old Fiesty Lady and the Puzzle Lady solve mysteries, and I would still read them. I like how each year the author writes the Puzzle Lady books with modern themes, such as using the web to Google a name and get information etc...."
5,Puts Streisand to Shame!,"Nancy LaMott was many things: a talented singer, a musician whose song interpretations were often brilliant, a loving human being, and an artist from whom many of today's singers could learn quite a lot. Her untimely death was tragic, as she had indeed overcome many health problems, and other obstacles, to become ""The Best Cabaret Singer in New York"" (according to New York magazine.) I had the honor of running her fan club, and was pleased to discover that she was a nice person in addition to being extremely talented. Her CD's, sadly, are being pulled off the market due to a legal battle with her estate, so BUY THEM NOW while you can! I feel I must amend an earlier posted review - ""Listen to My Heart,"" the title track, is NOT from ""Jekkyl and Hyde."" This album is not to be missed."
3,This album is not Miss LaMotts best effort!,"I am a hudge fan of miss LaMott, but this is not her best album. To be qiute honest I was a little disappointed. Of the 15, or so, songs on the album I found only three to be worth while. For I real treat listen to Nancy's ""My Foolish Heart"". In my oppinion that is her best album!"
3,Disappointing material,"If you plan to own just one Nancy Lamott album, don't make it this one. The songs are banal, cloying, and woefully unworthy of their supreme interpreter. Only do ""Out of This World"" and ""The Summer Knows"" rise above the obvious mush, which would be more suitable for a singer like Streisand. Try Nancy's ""My Foolish Heart"" for one of the best albums of music by one of best singers of our time."
4,Torch Music,"This CD by Nancy LaMott perhaps indicates how she was develping as a performer and when compared with ""Goodbyes"" done later, shows how much we missed in her early death, cutting short a lifetime of beautiful song. Thanks Jonathan Shwartz for bring her to my attention on WNET.Larry"
1,big mistake,I dont really like Stephen Frey but decided to give this book a chance because the plot sounded interesting. BIG MISTAKE. Frey totally botched this one. How come all of his characters have to be gorgeous? The man has no range as a writer. I got about 150 pages into this book and ended up tearing it apart page by page in a fit of rage at my stupidity for believing Frey could put out anything that might actually be interesting and thoughtful.
1,Ughhhhhhhh...,"All right, I've had it. I have officially had it. I have had it with Stephen Frey's repugnant dialogue, cliched characters, implausible plots, and refusal to research anything outside the financial world. All of which come into play in his latest offering, The Legacy. We are asked to believe so many ridiculous events and characters that it ultimately becomes far too much for Frey to ask of his readers. Even Frey's always interesting description of the high-pressure enviroment of a Wall Street trading company isn't enough to save this one."
2,Great premise and not much more....,"What a terrific first two chapters!! How did the rest of the book go downhill -- or was it nowhere?-- so quickly? I'm a fan of all Frey's other books but I was majorly disappointed with ""The Legacy."" For the first time, I didn't find too much sympathetic about the flawed hero; the female characters are still cardboard; and DAMN IT! The entire chase around the tape was built around vague, neverly fully defined or explained motives. If you read this book thinking you're really going to get an interesting ""what if"" tale about the JFK assassination, forget it. Go read all twenty-some volumes of the Warren Report, they'll be just as gripping. On the other hand, if you thought John Grisham's ""Pelican Brief"" was a terrific book you'll be sure to like ""The Legacy."" Please try again, Mr. Frey, I really enjoyed your other work."
1,"Tortured Dialog, Ludicrous Plot","In order to demonstrate the level at which Mr. Frey writes, I give you a paraphrase of some dialog in the book: Cole: I am going to Montana / Tory: No, you need to go to New York / Cole: I am going to Montana and that's final / (Cole heads for the door) / Tory: Where are you going? / Hello? I believe he said he was going to Montana. This type of hideous dialog is throughout the book, filling pages between stupendously ridiculous plot twists."
2,Too many convenient plot twists!,"Whenever you open a novel, you know what you are reading isfiction. You sign a silent pact with the author to suspend yourdisbelief, to enter the world of the story.That only works if the author respects the readers enough to present a plausible story. It didn't happen, of course, it's fiction. But it could have...The basic weakness of this novel is that there are too many ""out of the blue"" plot twists. The reader feels jerked around, manipulated, and the story comes off as completly unbelievable.She's his friend...no wait, she's a government agent...no, wait, she works for the mafia...no, wait, she has a heart of gold. It's too much, even for someone who has signed that silent pact to suspend disbelief.The basic plot here is intriguing. As a JFK assasination buff, I was drawn into the story. But once inside, I found it far less than satisfying.END"
2,"Don't Get Caught Up In ""The Legacy""","This book avoids a one star rating because of the main idea of the story, a second tape of the Kennedy assassination on the other side of his motorcade. Fry could do so much with that story, but instead writes a very bad book. He puts his hero into many corners, and doesn't know how to get him out of them. So, Cole (the hero) always has a gun, knife, or set of keys nearby which appear from nowhere. Another problem is the whole father-son business. Cole's father is dead, then he isn't. His dad as only one copy of the tape, then two. And, whgy would someone who has seen their son less than ten times in their entire life send this tape to him? Why not sell it himself? Oh, his dad is in another agency, caled the DIA. Do yourself a favor, do not get this book!"
4,Don't trust anyone...,"Once settled into the storyline you'll find it hard to put down. There's lots of twists and turns all the way from New York to Montana. You'll keep pulling for Cole Egan as he faces off against unknown enemies in the hope that the truth will finally be told. The only disappointment is at the end when you realize the truth behind the conspiracy, your'e still left wondering why."
4,From The Grassy Knoll....The Legacy is on target!,"As a student of the different JFK Assissination conspiracy theories for years, I found Stpehen Frey's The Legacy was a fun, ""can't put it down"" read. If you've tried to imagine what would happen if someone ever stumbled across the truth of 11/22/63, you will enjoy this book. If you enjoyed The Firm, you'll love The Legacy."
3,"I only read a excerpt, but so far it is good","I love it. The Inner Sanctum was great, and this should be another thriller. I can not wait for it to go on sale."
3,More of an action oriented novel than a thriller,aka Absolute Proof. Book does make compulsive reading but some of the situations that Cole Egan encounters suits a JAckie Chan type of screenplay rather than one in the style of Forsyth or Follett.
1,DO NOT BUY OR READ THIS BOOK,"Do not read this book, unless you like a diet of dog food. Frey's standard fare of horrific plots and stupid twists continue. Save your $17."
2,A not so good book,"Stephen Frey should really stick to his financial triller rather than trying to write some half-pass six type of political suspense.I would recommend the Stephen Frey's fan to give this a miss and to read ""The Takeover"" instead."
3,Revisits the Conspirary Theory in Kennedy Assasination,"Wall Street, the mafia and the White House, all in bed together. If you thought Nixon's and Clinton's shenanigans were terrible, how about a president working the mob and covert government agencies in concert and separately! The book revolves around a cassette tape that supposedly was taken the day of President Kennedy's assasination from a separate angle as the Zapruder pictures. Not to worry, the Wall Streeter hero wins the girl, money and day in the end and all is well."
2,I thought this one was dumb. He should stick to what he knows,"This one is (another) Kennedy assassination conspiracy. Frey is best when he writes about deals, intrigue and all the rest of it. This wasn't bad, but it didn't really hold my interest because of the plot. For those who care, it's alright. But it doesn't fall apart like another book in terms of writing. He's an uneven writer. Some are great insider views into the world of VCs and deals, but the writing falters. Others are better written, like this one, but the plot is silly.Well, if you like that sort of thing..."
2,Frey is becoming like Grisham (and that's not a good thing),"Frey is starting to crank out books too quickly like Grisham has done. The Legacy was somewhat entertaining, but there wasn't any depth to it. He needs to slow down and take his time with his next book. His ""The Takeover"" was great, but he's been slowly going downhill ever since."
1,Totally Unbelievable,"The storyline of this was unbelievable. Every time the central character gets in an impossible jam, he miraculously has anticipated the 'surprise'. How does this stuff get into mainstream print? Yuck."
4,An entertaining action and suspense novel,"Cole Egan, a bond trader in New York, obtains a videotape of John F. Kennedy's assassination. The tape provides evidence that the shooting was conspiratorial. A continuing conspiracy to suppress the tape involves the President, a Mafia chief, and intelligence agencies. And there are those who would pay large sums of money to acquire and then make public the tape. Cole finds himself in a life or death struggle to survive and to benefit financially. The many characters in the book are believable. The plot, and many sub-plots, are complex but are easy to follow, thanks to the writing skills of the author."
5,Great Author,"An easy read, and he kept the interest right to the end. He is a great author with an intriguing character. I can't wait to read the next book!!"
2,"A ""Yawner""","Celeste Yarnell is beautiful in this production; however The movie couldn't be more boring and the ending more stupid. Clearly low-budget. I was hoping to at least see some erotic scenes including Celeste, but that didn't happen either. Another vampire movie w/o bite and literally no fangs."
1,BOOTLEG BOOTLEG BOOTLEG!,LOVE THIS MOVIE. EXPERT ON THIS MOVIE! This dvd is a bootleg. The 11.99 recent release is the best way to go unless you can get a copy from the OOP LD. Buyer Beware!
4,Psychedelic desert bloodsucker,"This is a piece of early 70's cinemagic long overdue for any DVD release. The print is no better than a videotape, but making the film available at all is a step in the right direction.A dune buggy drivin' vampire seductress is not your standard Dracula fair, so don't come looking for a cape and pointy teeth. The music is hypnotic, cycling around a repeated dream sequence that feels like a cross between ""El Topo"" & ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"". ""The Velvet Vampire"" shares more similarities with ""Daughters of Darkness"" than Hammer vampire stories; Diane LeFanu is more a product of the American landscape than the Carpathian Mountains.Enjoy."
4,updating of the Dracula,"Psychedelic vampire film from the director of ""Terminal Island"" comes this mod vampire story. More or less a 1970 updating of the Dracula story, sultry Diane LeFanu (Celeste Yarnell) meets a young couple (California blond Sherry Miles and ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" star Michael Blodgett) and invites them to her pad in the desert...Is she a vampire? And who does she have her fangs set on? Shot the same year as Jess Franco's similar themed ""Vampyros Lesbos"", the somewhat stilted acting and dated hippy dialogue is salvaged by the director's excellent dream-like photography."
3,"Like it, but definitely don't love it.....","It was too short for my husband (and he's only 5' 8"") but good for me because I'm only 5'. Other cons are that the storage basket is too small, no cupholders for you or your child, it doesn't go to a full sitting position so my son was laying somewhat reclined the whole time (which he didn't like) and the drive is just okay...definitely not smooth as the Maclaren. You get what you pay for. The pros are that it's very compact when you fold it and it's lightweight. We bought this specifically for use in the busy downtown area and it worked out great. This stroller would be good to use once in awhile whenever you go into crowded areas, but not all the time."
3,Almost perfect,"This is a nice looking comfortable for the child and parent stroller. The pluses are that it's easy to open and close and folds down small for storage. The minuses are that storage on board this stroller is VERY limited. You'll have a hard time stuffing your purse in the basket much less your diaper bag, also there are no cup holders for either child or parent. Those are big minuses in my book,but I still like this stroller. I guess what we Moms are looking for is a lightweight version of our big strollers. This is not really it."
4,Reclining seat won't stay in up-right position,"I bought this stroller for my 9mo. old 21lb son and I loved it at first. The seat would not stay in the upright position and would slide to one side. I love this stroller so much I went back and exchanged it for another. So far no problems with this seat. I'm not sure why other people said their kids would slide out. I have a big boy and the shoulder straps are tough to tighten but, once you figure it out at least those stay in place.The other thing I don't care for on this stroller is the steering. It doesn't steer as easily as the Graco but, those are so big. This folds easily and it is very light. You can buy a universal cup holder for $10-15.(for parents) Overall I still like this stroller that is why I gave it 4-stars. All I can say is you get what you pay for."
4,Not really for new babies,"We bought this stroller for our 4 month old for traveling. It is compact and light weight and lays flat for our inant and does almost everything we dreamed. What doesn't work are the safety straps for an infant. Although the product advertises that it is for infants, the straps, both at hips and shoulders are too big for the infant. With some sewing I've done it now works fine. So, before you buy this for your itty bitty one, be ready to do some alterations. Otherwise, it's great!"
4,finally a great stroller,I have gone through 4 strollers in the last 5 months and I recently purchased this stroller and I love it. The baby looks comfy and the stroller has all the features she needs. As for the features for the parent as with any stroller there is give and take. The stroller does not have a parent tray but it steers easily with one hand and the basket is not large enough to put anything in. My husband and I were able to easily fix both of these problems at BRU by purchasing a cup holder and a hang on basket both pieces totalled $10. And the best part to me is the stroller is super light weight and fits great in my beetle!
4,Very Happy!,"I am very happy with my combi lightweight stroller. I bought it in addition to my large Graco stroller(which I like but for different reasons). It is the perfect stroller for when we are quickly running into the store (or mall) and esp. for long trips. Without this stroller (or something in its class) we wouldn't be able to have stroller on vacation. I would recommend this stroller to anyone who needs something lightweight, reliable and easy to use."
1,Old Games,I was looking for some new casino games. It takes a long time for new ones to come out. I saw these and thought the would be great. THEY ARE OLD. There's much newer up to date games out there. Stay away from these.
1,Dumb and Dumber,"The heroine is 200 and never realized if she closes her eyes when she drinks blood she won't faint at the sight of it? How does she manage to dress herself?A problem with this series is these are portrayed as ""good"" vampires, but they are disgusting. In all ""good"" vampire stories, they differ from ""bad"" vampires in that they have some respect for humans. Not these. They call their victims ""donors"" and refer to undiagnosed diabetics as ""sweet treats"". Offensive, to say the least.This writer has the very irritating habit in all her books of explaining insignificant things in great detail. And if you missed it the first time, fear not, she will repeat it a page later.How on earth did she find a publisher?"
1,Boring,"I found this book incredibly boring. I finally had to quit reading it after 1/3 of the way through.It just wasn't for me - and I LOVE Vamp romances, too."
1,JUST PLAIN SILLY!!!!,"Like a Jerk I bought the 4 for 3 promotion in this series. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! the story is so predictiable and is suppose to be funny; by making fun of vampires and IT WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL JUST PLAIN SILLY!!!! I was looking for a similar writting style like the author Kerrelyn Sparks!! who writes Hillarious,but Dangerous, Sensual Romanic Page Turners, that can make you laugh until you cry, so with that said this book was very disappointing!!!! So I guess I will read the others in the series since I already have them, when I just don't have anything else to read!!"
1,insipid,it is incomprehensible that this first truely awful book developed into a funny series. i have read everyother book in this series except this one prior to reading it now. i never read it because of the reviews. the past reviewers were correct. this is bad. i had to force myself to read the first 50 or so pages. then it got better but ended up being just as bad towards the end as the first 50 pages. it is quite unbelievable that a 200 year old vamp could still be as incompetent as a 5 year old child. ugh. you do not need to read this book to appreciate the other books in the series.
3,Not as funny as I would have hoped.,"I was disappointed that it was not as funny as I thought it would be. Not a very good shining example of the series but nice to read it you like the series anyways. Sometimes if you just love the characters despite the slow parts and it builds them for you this is a great read. If you are looking for funny and more action with romance of the hook, then you would be reading the wrong book."
2,Boring,"I had to push myself to finish this book, just hoping it would get better. It never did. Save your money."
4,Love reading this in order,"I'm 're-reading the series, this time in the order the author suggests rather than in th e published order. I'm finding it to be even more delightful the second time around. A confirmed Lyndsey Sands fan."
3,The start of the series,"The first part of this book dragged a little, but by the end has the reader interested in this new world of vampires, or immortals as they like being called. Definately worth reading, then go one to the rest of this awesome series."
2,Reads like a 30 min. sitcom,"Having never read any of this series, I wanted to do it in order. This book is the first of the series, but wasn't published in that order. I can see why. If anyone else, that likes this series would start with this book, they would most likely stop with this book too. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, and does have a few funny parts to it, but not enough to make me want to buy another book in the series. It's like watching a TV sitcom, a laugh here and there, with a bit of silly plot.I've read other reviews on other books in the series, and people really like them. So, I'm at a crossroads as to going on to the next book. Just don't know if I want to invest the time to see if this series improves."
1,Ridiculously stupid,"I made the mistake of buying this book for its cover. It was interesting, unique, cute, and sexy. The book? Not so much so.The vampires, who are really old enough to have a little bit more life experience, are all complete bimbos. The male lead was a useless bimbo himself, and I couldn't wait to see him run over by a truck. If characters you want to throttle aren't enough, the desperate rationalization of rape, kidnapping and brainwashing will turn you right off (If they don't remember, you've only really stolen time, and anyway they don't even miss it). If it weren't so ridiculous I might have been offended, but the writing and characterizations are so poor I could only be disappointed.All in all, this may be the worst vampire novel I have ever read. Do not buy this book."
4,"maybe not my favorite in this series, but....","I overall liked this story! O.K. maybe it was a little slow...for the first half, but boy did it pick up towards the end! Maybe Greg wasn't an ""alpha"" male, but gee, he sure was sweet! I really liked the way the author handled Greg's ""turning"", and it answered some of my questions as to how they were going to be together. Hopefully, the next in this series will be about Thomas! If you could forget the (gasp) ""spiderman"" pajamas, he seemed to have one heck of a sense of humor, and seemed quite sexy, also! He needs to have his own story!!!!"
2,Way to easy,"The only reason i finished the book is because I bought it via Kindle and though and hoped it was going to get better!The story could be good, but it's all a little too easy.They are supposed to be Vampires, but the main character is nothing but weak and annoying. She is spoiled and a total brat.Her ""live mate"" is a loser who would trust anyone. He is a psychologist and a babysitter. He has no back bone and worst of all agrees to everything. What a loser of a Man.The conversation throughout the book is beyond lame and childish.The main bad guys are stand around being confused and helpless weaklings. Besides the fact that the are as bright as a box of rocks.Poor Thomas is over 200 and is such child, who had all the potential."
5,Loved it!,"Ms. Sands is a staple in our paranormal romance book swap at work-we all love her and have devoured her Argeneau Vampire series hungrily-this was is ranking at an 8 in our group out of 10 (10 being the best)-I loved the characters and the humor. Ms. Sands never disappoints me. The book is too too cute and I loved the romance and in depth bonding of the 2 main characters plus-Thomas' Spiderman PJ's-LOL-some of our group have commented that Ms. Sands is a bit predictable and her reads are no-brainers but we that hasn't stopped the love we have for her-our group has been converted to devout fans of hers and I highly recommend this book as well as the entire series-good, quick, easy reading that makes you laugh and feel all mushy inside-LOL-plus there's some hot scenes in here-read it and I dare you not to at least like it a little bit-LOL"
5,Great series,I have read all the Argeneau series and this one is very entertaining. Highly recommend.
1,Boring Boring Boring,"I couldn't finish this book. I honestly tried to finish the book, but not only was the plotline unbelievible, the dialog is that of a 10 year old."
3,Not her usual humor,"There are lots of reviews for this book here, so I won't go into the plot details and what order to read this series in. I will say I was enormously disappointed in the lack of humor. Ms. Sands is a favorite of mine and she usually has me laughing out loud. She single-handedly brought me back to historical romances (see ""Bliss,"" ""The Key,"" and ""The Chase""), but this installment of the Atlantean vampires left me feeling quite ho-hum. It's not a bad book, just nothing special. I hope she gets her groove back and gives us a book about cousin Thomas. That would be a hoot!"
2,Lacking in substance,"This and the last book have lacked in substance what the first two books in the Argeneau vampire series had offered. Dr. Hewitt seems so compliant and there was no mention of the brothers except Sebastian. Doesn't even fit with the other books. I would have expected Lissi's brothers to want to grill Greg, as much as the cousins did. I didn't mind that the book is out of order as much as I do mind that it's out of focus."
3,"A good read, but slow at times","I enjoy all of theis series, but this one got a little tedious and slow in parts. But overall a good escapist read."
3,A hard start,"I started reading this series because a friend raved about it. I found the book kind of hard to get into. I kept pushing myself thinking it has to get better. I found myself not liking the main character so well. How could a 200 yr old vampire be that clueless? Really? I spotted the plot right away, and I usually don't do that! How she lived that long is a wonder to me. She even mentioned it herself.This is the first book I read. I will reserve judgement and read the second. I've been told that I give up too easily sometimes. I almost made that mistake with Janet Evanovich. Hopefully, this series will get better too."
4,Wonderful kick off of a new series,"This is a really great start to a new series.I really enjoyed this book. However, I did have a tough time with remembering all the characters (there were many...who I am assuming will be in featured in following books).Ms. Sands has come up with a new idea for how vampires were created...though at some points her medical explanations were hard to follow - as in they did not make much sense - but her take on vampires is wonderfully fresh.I would highly recommend this book to all those who enjoy tasty paranormal romances."
3,Cute Story,"This book was a little bit of a slow read at first, especially while she explained the rules and regulations of this vampire community. Once it finally picked up I found the love story between them quite charming."
2,BORING,I am glad I did not read this one first because I would not have read any of the other books in this series. It went on for page after boring page and was lacking on plot. I would recommend reading one of the others before you pick up this one.
5,Bite Me Anytime,"I have read the entire Argeneau series and I LOVE them. I can not wait till the next one comes out. I did not read the series in order, but it didn't matter. I love the characters and the emotions of the books. I found it very easy to get into and relate to the characters. I recommend this series to anyone who has an open mind and is into vamp romance with some mystery added."
3,Close your eyes and bite down,"I didn't realize when buying this that it was a) a romance novel and b) part of a series. It has the titillation of the former and can pass for a stand-alone without needing the back story of the latter. The characters are ... often clueless ( I was going to say vapid, but that would be too strong ) and it begs reason as to how the ones who are less than 400 have not been staked out to bake long before the goings on of this work. From the reviews I've seen of Sands' other works in this series, I would recommend that this not be your introduction to it; I'll myself consider picking up 'Single White Vampire', which I think is her first in this series, to see if it is an expected improvement over this installment."
5,great,Great story line keeps you glued to the book. i didn't want to put it down always a grreat read
2,Poor writing skills,"Explanations of various aspects such as ""vampire rules"" and personal history of characters not done in a subtle way. Bad guys were more interested in explaining to their victims how and why they were carrying out their bad deeds than in carrying out the bad deeds. Totally monologuing.Oh and this may be a spoiler, so stop reading if you don't want any spoilage, but how often do you have to be interrupted by multiple family members unexpectedly gathering in your bedroom before you learn to at least lock the door? For that matter, why do the family members think nothing of barging into bedrooms without knocking when their adult cousin is with her new boyfriend?"
3,Good quick read,Light read. Started slow. Got better late in the book. 200 years old vampires were treated like children. Not what I expected.
2,BAD (ALMOST) TEEN LITERATURE,"Omitting the few sex scenes, this was really teen literature. It involved six or so cousins/friends, having slumber parties and constantly answering to their parents. The story itself moved VERY VERY VERY slowly, picking up a little speed late in the book only to slow down again (and become quite silly) near the end. The whole fainting-at-the-sight-of-blood thing got very old and never really made sense (it wasn't the blood that almost killed someone, but the biting and drinking.) The narrator certainly wasn't the worst I've heard, but her monotonous tone didn't help an already dead tale."
3,Too quick,"Decently written and different take on vampires. It had pretty much no plot though, which made me start to lose interest. The story itself spends inordinate amounts of time on small amounts of time. The entire thing took place in a matter of just a couple of days. I had a hard time with that as it didn't seem like enough happened to really create a lasting bond between the hero/heroine. It all happened too fast.The characters themselves are immature and shallow. Greg wasn't much of a hero to me. He'd make a better best friend than a romantic idol.I had a hard time keeping the secondary characters straight, but they were definitely interesting and I can see more books on the way."
3,OH NO!! I WAS DUPED!,"My first book by this author was Bite Me if You Can and I thought I had stumbled onto something original and funny. But this book is almost a mirror of that book. Sure the circumstances are different but it is the same down to every familial interuption and villian peeping tom. Can't say that it was an awful book because I did love BMIYC but after reading a few of Feehan books I have wanted to steer clear of serial repetitive writers. AND saying that--I know I am going to continue scooping up her books.And not to be picky because until this author I never caught any spelling errors and let most things slide but here is funny mistake: During an especially vigourous moment (wink wink)the herione puts her head onto what I am sure the author meant to write ""collar bone"" but in stead wrote ""shoulder blade"" which would be a different spin on an age old activity I dare say. Perhaps the nanos also make you exceptional limber?? Or maybe he was just short."
2,Had to force myself to get through this book,"I really had to force myself to finish this book. I am not going to lie... I even skipped ahead at parts. The characters had potential but the dialog seemed to drag on. I felt the author had some good ideas with situtations in the storyline, but the play out lacked imagination."
3,In response to Delia Perez's complaint,"The item description CLEARLY states that the foreword was written by Cisneros. Nowhere does it say that she is the author. Also, the picture of the cover CLEARLY states the same thing. Plus, you don't request a refund from amazon by posting a complaint in the review section. Geez."
4,Mock Trial Series,I like it and think it will be helpful for my students. As I know nothing about mock trials. It is pricey though.
5,Very pleased!,"I use this Bible History textbook for my middle grade students. I am very pleased with its content and the workbook as well. I find the questions at the end of each section thoroughly reinforce the information given in the textbook. I use the worksheets for quizzes, homework or some extra credit points."
1,Needs to be revised,Pretty dated. Not particularly helpful for young Catholics of this generation. Would like to see some of the difficult issues explained from a biblical perspective such as the status(or lack of) of women and how the church justifies its patriarchy in the 21st century as these are questions that young people are interested in. The 'Things to Know and to do' at the end of each chapter are not going to satisfy today's young men and women. The book needs to be seriously updated from the 1931.
3,Good quality but smaller than expected,"This was a gift for a man and I liked the unisex look of the packaging. All of the tools are of good quality and the socks were ourfavorite. The only thing that I disliked about this product was the foot cream that came with it, the lotion itself was really nice with a great smell. However, the package its self was so small, there was barely enough to put on both feet and it looked like it was a sample you would get out of a magazine. I would recomend this product for a stocking stuffer, grab bag gift or a gift to go with a gift."
1,Just Say No!,"I bought this book for a History of Furniture class and found I didn't use it at all. While there are discriptions of the pieces, there are only black and white sketches of select styles, not a good visual. You can find better info on the internet."
1,No accessories available,"This product was not usable because of the 5/8 inch drive. No sockets or adaptors available, even from Milwaukee. And they were of no help finding any. Returned the item to Amazon. I must say, Amazon was super quick at processing the return and giving a refund."
3,"Good reference, but expected a bit more.....","I purchased this title thinking it would be a much more technical analysis of the B-29. While a decent reference with many good photos of early production machines, I found it lacking when specific details were needed. Still, for the price, a good reference to have."
5,Best collection ever!,"My second child agrees with the first, this one is the best. They love the illustrations and request the same poems over and over. We took only one book on a plane trip and this was it. It had all the stories for my 3yo and poems for both the 3yo and 1yo. I am buying my third copy tonight because, well, accidents happen."
5,The Best Nutrition Information I Have Read,"This is a no-nonsense, cut-to-the-chase book which gives you the information you need to eat sensibly. In a world of empty diet promises that offer weight loss that cannot be maintained, this book gives readers a formula for life. What a relief to read diet/nutrition information that does not come with a sales pitch for products that cannot offer a long-term solution. Thank you, Dr. Ann."
4,Great for two hours.,"This game is fun and enjoyable the first time you play it, but it isn't very replayable, and it's short."
5,One voice like no other,"In every CD Nancy LaMott brings tears to my eyes..not only because she is gone now and cannot create magic any longer, but because her voice touches my heart. I look forward to her family getting together other songs she recorded and producing yet another priceless CD."
5,Wonderful Voice!,"Thanks to Jonathan Schwartz and the High Standards XM radio station #73, I discovered Nancy LaMott. Sometimes at first listen, she sounds like Streisand and other times like Celine, but she is truly a unique and rare voice of our time that has apparently been overlooked in the mainstream. This CD is just wonderful, though I am sad to learn of her untimely passing in 1995. She could have given us so much more."
5,Great Learning Tool,"I'm taking a QuarkXPress class at a local community college and this book is used as our textbook. The exercises and accompanying CD are extemely helpful in getting the uninitiated started in Quark. There are other books that could be as helpful further down the road, but without the interactive experience provided by the CD & tutorials, you'll only be reading about it as opposed to actually doing something. The hands-on approach of this book makes all the difference in the world. When trying to learn a demanding program like Quark, any advantage is welcomed. I found this book to be an excellent learning tool."
2,eh...........,"Using QuarkXPress may not be very much fun in itself, but this book didn't even attempt to rescue me from this gutter I was already in. Occasional errors weren't too distractive, but the method of teaching just didn't work. Many times, I found myself instructed to do something, but after having completed it, I had no idea for what purpose and to what end I had just accomplished.Another querk I found in this Quark book was that it attempted to cram too much information all at once. The book looks small, but the wealth of information is overdone. I learned a lot of stuff, but I also forgot a lot of it afterwards due to excess information spilling out my ears. If only the author would have slowed down a bit and taken a few hundred more pages to explain important concepts, I may have retained more of what I had learned.I believe for this book to be more of an asset, more ""why"" comments after the ""do this"" comments would have cleared things up a bit."
2,Not all it seems to be,"First this program will NOT recognize the CF cards out of my Nikon D3 camera. Second this program will ONLY recover jpeg & tiff files. It claims to be able to recover raw files from all major camera makers like Nikon & Canon. NOT true, have even uploaded the upgrade and still will NOT help with any file recovery from my D3. I should return it, but think it is too late. So don't buy this if you shoot in raw and hope to recover files."
3,Decent reference,"Has anyone actually sent in the 2 dozen or so corrections to the publisher? The text is weak on analytics and not a 'stand alone' reference for the tougher certification exams (ASQ, Moresteam, etc).Even so, it is one of the best commercial volumes out there - in terms of organization and potential benefit to the practitioner.They should take a page off Juran's Quality Handbook, or other Engineering Handbooks (Perry's), on formatting and content development."
3,It could be better,"First: For a six sigma book, this book has too many spelling mistakes. It's incredible.Second: As far as the DMAIC explanation, the book is very superficial. It could have been named :""Six sigma green belt handbook"".Third: The book gives a good overview about lean and kaizen projects.Fourth: The book develops well enough the six sigma management system.This book may complete some previous ideas bearing in mind that this won't be your six sigma first book."
3,Decent book but lacking,I did like the step by step walk through probability that gives a validation of the why behind many of the 6S tools. I also liked the manner in which the book presented the exercises with the answers to assure reader understanding and correct use in excel. The other value in this book is that all the tools presented are producible utilizing MS excel which most people in a business environmen t have vs. a 1K+ purchase of Minitab or SPSS.What helped me most were these 2 books:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CJT2ZShttp://www.amazon.com/The-Sigma-Black-Belt-Handbook/dp/B0018DDDHK/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344538323&sr;=8-10&keywords;=black+belt+six+sigma
3,Read this and decide!!,"Well, this is published by the Motorola University and contain reference to some of the content discussed in their Six Sigma Black Belt programmes. As in general if you are in love with the original ""concepts"" and a collector of Six Sigma books go ahead. Motorola actual black belt programmes includes high practical content making you a capable practitioner. Well you cant expect that from this material. This is a reference for those seeking clarity on the concepts rather than tools. Well out of the two Black Belt Handbooks available in the market as at the date this review was made this stands clearly behind Pzydeks Handbook and ahead of ASQs handbook. There are spelling mistakes, but those are not that so bad."
1,Vanilla,"If you've got any sort of experience with networking Chapter 1, 3, 5, and 8 are worthless ""basics"" stuff (thin-net, thick-net, 10-Base-T, etc.). Except for some limited information on doing a little router programming, this isn't a Cisco book at all. It's just a vanilla overview of network topologies, protocols, switching, and routing.I bought it based largely on the statement in the book description above that ""This friendly guide offers easy-to-follow explanations of everything from different Cisco router models..."" These ""explanations"" are the same little blurbs you can find on Cisco's Web site. I was hoping for a guide that showed you how to select the proper device, modules, WICs, flash memory options, etc. from the baffling array offered by Cisco and was very disappointed.If you're looking for a guide on using Cisco equipment to set up a network, look somewhere else."
4,Good book not so great disk,The book has been very helpful in my studies and my job. I used this book along with a DVD boot camp to prepare for my CCENT and CCNA. I passed my CCENT and I am working on my CCNA using this book. The disk has some good software on it buy you have to purchase a full version in order for the simulator to be of any use for preparing.
5,Good introduction to Karol Rathaus,"Karol Rathaus' career was varied. He wrote film scores, symphonies, a respected opera, flirted with cabaret music and was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera for an English language version of Mussorgsky's Godunov. After he left Europe to escape the Nazis, he became a a respected professor of music at Queens College in New York City. Listening to this album is the best way to appreciate his music. He uses some elements of popular music of his time as well as current styles of European classical music. I respect the symphonies, but the four pieces on this album are more enjoyable. I suspect this will be the only album of his music I will want to keep in my collection. I wish it also included a little of the film music, but often we cannot get all we want."
5,Excellent Game.,"Probably one of the best Megaman NT games, being brought to the DS is awsome, sure there are some moments where playing it on the DS might seem weird compared to the GBA but it more than handles itself well, a great pick up."
4,Sweet,"I love the interaction I get to have while playing the game, its like your DS is a actually a PET and megaman is your navi thanks to the stylus. I think that this game is sweet"
3,OK introduction to Qt,"The book covers pretty well the design of Qt and introduces the concepts of signal/slots allright, but the book is not very deep in technicalities. The worst about this book is that the cover claims it covers Qt1.4 and Qt2, but the examples are VERY Qt1.4 specific, i.e. they compile on Qt1.4 NOT on Qt2. The only Qt2 related I can find in this book is a 5 page chapter in the end of this book"
3,Needs more depth,"I found this book to be clearly written, and not difficult to follow and succinct, and not sufficient to answer enough of my programming questions to feel comfortable creating my own programs. You definitely need to study the Troll Tech-provided documentation to go very far beyond the book in programming, but the documentation reads like it was written as a reference, for people who understand but simply need a reminder. The book needs about two hundred more pages explaining examples and critical subjects like slot-signal interactions, layouts and many of the widgets more completely.This book makes a good overview, but needs more depth. At the time, it was about the only book available, so I cannot say that it was a mistake to get the book when I did. I hope that other books coming out on Qt have more depth and more complete explanations."
4,"Good addition, but short on pithy examples","This is indeed a very good book but it can't compete with Solin's ""Qt Programming"" (published by Sams) as an introduction (at least not in it's present 1st edition..perhaps the soon to be published 2nd edition will be such an improvement that this situation will change, but I think that's unlikely). Depending on your budget and the improvements that come into edition 2, this is a worthwhile addition to any Qt programmer's bookshelf.The main weakness of the book is the shortage of succinct and simple examples that illustrate the various Qt classes and concepts. (This is where Solin, on the other hand excels). There is one hefty example (Qtscribble) that is presented in various versions in the chapters 2 and 3. The rest of the book presents only code snippets and (worthwhile) discussions. Edition 1 is also quite outdated so waiting for edition 2 is very advisable."
3,A Bit Outdated but can be a useful tool.,"This book is a great book for one with a lot of C++ experience in programming and for one who likes to hunt and peck at debugging. But, unless one has an older version of Qt, it can be quite trying because so much has changed in the newer versions.I would say this book is generally inexpensive and can be useful as a backup reference source. I was able to get all the way up to the Scribble program using the later version of Qt3. But after that, it became very difficult to upgrade the code to Qt3.The three star rating I gave this book is only because it is outdated. It is a good book and delves into the code in detail, however outdated."
4,He's Back,"It's been over 15 years since I heard this album on vinyl. Now, CD quality without the hissing, scratches, and skips makes this an even better album than I remember. It's so great to hear Carl's voice again. This album rocks. So many of the songs remind me of my youth when I was growing up especially ""Giving You Up."" The soft spoken lyrics that build to a crescendo at the end always electrifies me."
2,not bad,"nice singing,very good musicians but mostly so so songs and especially poor production(typical for mainstream artists of the time) make this album essential only for the diehards.reminds me of Christopher Cross."
5,What a great voice!!,"Carl Wilson was always the quiet one in the family, the peacemaker. In this CD, Carl's voice lets you know why - he's got the voice of an angel and now that he's gone from us, I'm sure that's what he is. If you love natural tenors, you've got to loveCarl's songs...he sings from his big heart and he's left us with this gift. I recommend it highly and promise you you'll never regret getting it."
5,A must have for the Carl Wilson fan!,"I am so happy that this delightful album was re-released on CD! We knew his voice in many songs with the Beach Boys. Carl just has the most beautiful and distinctive voice. He sings each and every song from his heart - the heart and voice of an angel. That is how he is described most often. What You Do To Me is a rockin' song and so different from what you're used to hearing when he performed with the Beach Boys. Carl really stretches out here and shows his stuff and just how powerful and versatile his voice really is. One More Night Alone - a ballad written by Carl's former brother-in-law, Billy Hinsche, is a beautiful love song that digs down deep and emits such emotion. Very Highly Recommended!"
5,An Excellent Book!,"If you enjoyed ""Anna and the King,"" I think you will love this book. It is filled with huge glossy photos, many of them close-ups of Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes. It contains tons of historical background information on the movie and makes for a very interesting read. I highly recommend it."
5,Classic Pasta Cookbook,"Received the book in good condition and immediately started looking through it. I read cookbooks like books from begining to end, one page at at time. I then decide what recipe to try. I have tried one recipe already and we really enjoyed it. It has great step by step directions to follow. Also I like the pages describing the different types of pastaand what works with what. Great book to have if you like pasta."
5,Great cookbook,"This is a great pasta cookbook for the novice Italian cook. It has beautiful multiple full color illustrations for every recipe, as well as tips and illustrations of the prep of the ingredients. The ingredients are listed in both metric and american units. There are recipes on how to make each type of pasta from scratch and what sauces go well with each. The sauces all have readily available ingredients. I would never have attempted to make pasta from scratch prior to getting this cookbook. It is too bad it is out of print. I was lucky to have gotten it from a distributor in England."
4,Paradise Lost live! A superb CD.,"The only reason I give this CD four stars instead of five, is that the latter half of the CD is a better compilation of material than the first. This is an excellent CD nonetheless. I wonder though, if live performances from later in their career will be recorded onto compilations like this one? To get to the point, this is a good CD overall, and a nice introduction into Paradise Lost's older material slanted more toward the doom metal genre as opposed to the lighter Gothic Metal recorded later in their career. Paradise Lost is one of my favorite bands (I've seen them in concert with Opeth), and they deserve more attention. This is the fourth CD of theirs I have bought so far, and I am only more convinced over the years of how diverse and talented this Gothic Metal act is. I recommend this CD to any metal fan interested in one of the most influential metal bands that explores the darker side of metal. It is a real treat."
2,This is a cd that most Glenn Miller fans will like........,"For this particular cd the band played some of Glenn Millers' origianal arrangements, but also played some of the original arrangments that had been reworked. The end product is a fairly decent cd. I really enjoyed hearing this cd, with all the modern technology used to enhance the sound of the band.The biggest concern i have about this cd is the fact that some of the songs played on it were not my favorite GM songs. Some of the vocals were not that good either. All and all, i would say this a marginal cd.I have always been a GM fan and will die one. I do like this cd enough to where i would buy it again if i had to.I Can Recommend This Cd"
4,Mom and baby BOTH learn Italian!,"I speak Italian but it's getting rusty so I find myself learning a lot while this fun CD is playing. I keep it in the car and everytime we drive somewhere, my 1 year old and I listen to the poems, songs and rhymes. He's now starting to respond with giggles and coos when the songs he likes comes on. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I'd love to hear more kids voices because my son really responds to them more than the adult voices. But that's minor in all the sounds he's being subjected to and all the phrases, nursery rhymes, etc. He's been listening to this CD since he was 5 months old."
1,do not buy it,"I am Italian and I thought about buying it, since I do not have much babies' Italian music here in Los Angeles and I am not planning any trip soon. Now, the CD has such an old fashon music with vocabulary that we do not use anymore. Plus, few songs are read instead of sung (I think not to pay copyrights or something like that) which makes it absolutely bad. Some songs are not even sung by Italians and the pronunciation of words is not correct!!! I played only once and then put it in a drawer and I'll never pick it up again. Thank God my mom is coming and she is going to bring REAL italian music for children. THe one I want my baby to listen to and sing along with.Lorena"
5,One of my favorites in the Skye O'Malley saga,"I truly enjoyed Valentina and thought her character better than Velvet and Jasmine. I loved how this book touched on so many other stories. The Mediteranean island where Janet Leslie was taken (see ""The Kadin"") and the return of Cica Pasha. (see ""Love Wild and Fair""). Of course, I loved seeing Esther Kira again. Valentina is stronger than Aidan, but very much her mother's daughter. I can't say enough good things about this book. There is romance, adventure, and on-the-edge-of-your-seat-suspense."
5,Wow,"This was the first Bertrice Small I ever read.The book is historically illuminating. Filled of adventure. love, lust, and courage.The story is saturated with all forms of passion. Bertrice Small's work isn't just romance, it's also quite erotic.The characters are so alive and realistic. Female and Male alike are prideful, arrogant, domineering, and foolish.The passion of Valentina, Patric, and Lord Cica will keep fans reading to the end. This book is wonderful."
4,Just Lovely!,"There is something about a Bertrice Small book that lends itself to just being glad that you are reading yet another one. She develops her characters well and her story too. You never feel that,""I've read this before,different names,same story""when you come to the end. And that's why I like her books. It is always a good read and I meet three dementional people each time within a good story plot. Plus, I love this period of history and she takes the time to write within that period. She never writes just another romance.She writes a good book that happens to have romance in it and that's the big difference for me as an avid reader of all kinds of books."
3,"If you haven't read the first 4, don't even try it.","I like this author and I have read the first of the series, Skye O'Malley. But, I couldn't follow this at all. If you haven't read all the first 4 (recently enough to remember them also), you will never be able to get through it."
1,Where is the romance?,"This is the book in this series with the most ""romance""....but that is not saying much at all! I usually find myself drawn to the world of the people I read about, but this book and this series have not done this for me. These books are just pornography in the deceptive package of a romance novel. I am very sorry I have wasted my time and money."
1,Not worth it!!!,It states potential house-breaking problems but not how to address them. It is not helpfull at all. Out-dated. You're better off getting a cheaper guide book than this one!!!
3,Jump Start 2nd Grade Spelling Work Book - don't bother,"If this is 2nd grade spelling then no wonder our nation's educational standards have dipped so low. This is 1st grade stuff, and not much of it. At a dollar or two, the book might be worth some fun at home, but as a teaching tool? Naw. You can really get about the same thing at any dollar-store with out the added cost of shipping."
5,Great entertainment and background relaxing music,"Nancy is a wonderful entertainer, she did it all well, it's sad we have lost someone with her talent but she has left a terrific legacy of talent and music.She is a joy to listen to in even CD of hers I own.She is great for those special moments and because she faced life with such zest she is also inspiring."
3,Depatie Freleng's funny animals meet Mission Impossible,"A 1972 Depatie Freleng series for NBC, featuring dogs and cats whofight crime despite various pitfalls and pratfalls. Stutz is thefearless leader, Putty Puss the master of disguise; Mussel Muttthe big, burly sheepdog, Rhubarb the inventor, and so on. Thesefour cartoons are good for nostalgia purposes--not extremely funnybut the characters and situations are charming and it was goodvoice casting (Michael Bell, Aldo Ray, Arte Johnson, Joe Besser, etc.)Doug Goodwin's theme and incidental music are catchy. The first cartoonon here features a 10 year old cowboy-clad boy (voice of Don Messick)and that's the age I was when this show first aired. And the humormight work best for kids of that age or so--though someone my age can stillenjoy it."
4,I don't get why people hate this so much...,"Sure, Zwan wasn't Smashing Pumpkins. But, then again, nothing can replicate Smashing Pumpkins. The main difference is that Mary Star of the Sea is...well, it's happy. It's very happy. The first time I listened to it, I was a bit shocked too. The lyrics aren't as ""deep"" as SP lyrics were, and the melodies somewhat less complicated. In my opinion, it doesn't really matter. Mary Star of the Sea is lush, beautiful, and seems to capture the essence of warm weather and sunshine. Standout tracks: Honestly--perfect first single. Jesus, I/Mary Star of the Sea--whoa. Best...religious song...ever! Something even atheists can enjoy. Come With Me--Bright and happy. You can just imagine the smile on Billy's face when he's singing this one. Apparently, Zwan wasn't for everyone, but I for one was sad to see them go."
3,Zwan's Mary Star of the Sea doesn't quite float my boat,"Back in the mid-early 90's I remember listening to great music. The Smashing Pumpkins made this happen with great songs like ""Bullet with butterfly wings"" ,""Today"", ""Cherub Rock"" and ""Zero"". Now Billy Corgan had formed a new band. Zwan. What a name. I heard the first sinlge ""Honestly"" and I wasn't to impressed but I figured I'd pick up the album because it Billy Corgan.I was disappointed...Billy have you forgoten how to rock out? What is wiht this Jesus/Christain [junk]? ""Of a broken heart"" was interesting but ""Disarm"" was a better acoustic song. All in all only 3 stars for Zwan sorry."
4,"Not Bad, Not To Bad At All","Upon Purchasing This Album I Had Only Heard ""Honestly"". So I Wasnt To Sure On What To Expect From The Rest Of The Album But From What I Could Tell By Listening To ""Honestly"" I Knew It Be A Good Album. Now This Is Not The Smashing Pumpkins It Is Zwan And The Difference Is Plainly Clear. This Is A Much Mellower Billy Corgan But Its Damn Good. Now It Only Gets 4 Stars Because It Should Have A Couple Of Harder Tunes, But Hey Im Not The Musician. If Ya Love Smashing Pumpkins Then Youll Probably Like Zwan. I Mean Come On Billy Corgans A Hell Of A Songwriter And He Still Got It. Even If Your Not Familiar With Smashing Pumpkins This Is A Good Album Nonetheless, But It'll Be More Appreciated By The Ones Who Know Where It Came From."
1,unimpressed,"If you miss Smashing Pumpkins and hope to recapture Billy Corgan's original music, Zwan is NOT the CD to buy. Billy Corgan is at fair and unfair advantages with the release of this CD. His name will sell it, but his name will also lead fans to expect more than what they get. For what the CD is worth, it is adrenaline-pushing and intense, but no mellow tones help balance out Mary Star of the Sea. This album didn't jump out and grab me even after 5 listens. I sold mine back."
2,Billy Corgan Runs Out of Words?,"I have been a Pumpkins fan since they first hit the scene. That said, this is no Pumpkins' album. This is something wholly other. And mostly, the changes are for the worse. While some of the songs are tuneful, and Corgan's voice still has that raw edge, I found this album to be painfully monotonous. Nearly every song repeats itself over and over and over and over and over, ad nauseum. If you like Billy so much that you simply must participate in his religious experience, get the album. If you get bored easily, and if poetic lyrics mean anything at all to you, steer clear. Some of the lines are clever, even deep and thoughtful, but hearing the same ones repeated continually for four minutes straight seems to suck the meaning out of them."
4,Concise,I've been pretty impressed after 3 listens - very concise and to the point. Paz's writing definitely contributes.
5,ZWAN = SMASHING PUMPKINS,"I could not beleive my ears! Billy Corgan just sent me back to yesteryear! The moment you hear his voice there is no denying HE's BACK! The sound is VERY VERY MUCH Pumpkins. I felt like an addict who just got a fix! I am very happy with this album. It has been the only album I've listened to since I got it, 3 days ago. If you like the Pumpkins then you will UNDOUBTEDLY enjoy this album. IT ROCKS! ""Desire"" is earily poetic and hearfelt.A rose by any other name is still a rose and ZWAN is just another name! The key I think is Jimmy on drums and Billy's voice. How could it not sound like the Pumpkins? The truth is, it is Pumpkins just with another name."
4,melodic,"this is a truly melodic album from Billy Corgans new groupd Zwan. Excellent guitar work is present throughout the album but the best part of it is the melodies that the band brings. Paz is the bassist for A Perfect Circle as well, and as A Perfect Circle is a more meolidic Tool, this is a more melodic Pumpkins. An excellent album. Good musicianship."
3,Not quite what I ZWANted.,"Now it's not that I wanted ""Zwan"" to sound just like ""The Smashing Pumpkins"", I just wanted them to be as good. But, just as ""Audioslave"" isn't as good as ""Soundgarden"" was, ""Zwan"" isn't quite the great pumpkins. Yes, this is a good album. It simply is however too rockin', too happy. Almost more guitar noise than I personally like. Also there is no ""darkness"", which always was an appealing part of Corgan's former band. I'm sure many people enjoy the lighter, sunnier sound. I can like it too, just not for very long. So in summary, it is a fairly good listen, and it does rock, it just doesn't ""Cherub Rock""."
2,I think that this album needed more moods and modes and keys,"There aren't enough moods on this album. It's all this D majorish/B minorish modal ylep yadda yadda bonk introspection-with-no-outcome-or resolution nonsense.The music is often monotonous and boring. Sunny Day Real Estate had some really nonsense lyrics, but at least their music was powerful.Dave Pajo is really a great guitarist though. Ever heard of him? Try ""Fight Songs"" by The For Carnation.Added 6/22/03: The best song on the record in my opinion is ""El Sol""."
5,My 2nd Favorite of Corgan's works,"While I was crushed at the news of the Pumpkin's demise, I could not have been happier with Billy's follow up band. I found Zwan to be different from the Pumpkins in all the right ways. This album definately has a ""happier mood"" than most SP releases. It's almost as if Corgan has found peace with his questions about his faith and God.He's gone from ""God is empty, just like me"" to ""a white horse picks my dreams up to take my hopes to god. My prayers have nestled brightly to dim my sense of awe"" and ""i want you to be that answer. An answer i must defend. I want us to solve our distrust of everyone and trust in god"" While questions of faith certainly make for good musical inspiration, Corgan has found equally good inspiration from his apparent faith.Billy is one of my generation's greatest poets and I believe this is one of his greatest works. Buy it and Baby, Let's rock!"
3,"honestly, i'm sort of disappointed.","I've never been a fan of rock for the sake of rock, but I can enjoy rock as long as the songs stand as good songs even without all the distortion and heavy drumming. The loudness and energy are supposed to add to an already good song, but not take a bad song and make it good, just by adding weird effects and distortion. Unfortunately, I only found 3 or 4 songs on this cd that I thought were good songs in themselves. And on even fewer songs were there lyrics that I found had any meaning to me. However, the production on the album is excellent, some of the guitar sounds are mindboggling; also, all the riffs and solos were interesting to me, I'd actually go so far to say that the guitar work is what keeps me from getting a refund. But I need to say, if you've been a die hard pumpklins fan, you might as well get this."
1,zhit zandwich...,"this obnoxious, tuneless, distorted mess redefinez dreck. time to go back to the starting block, old man."
1,Billy Burke? and Jesus?,If I wanted to be preached to about faith and Jesus I think I would go to church. The songs that stay away from religious over-tone and preaching are okay but for the rest it just doesn't work. It's disappointing actually i figured that Billy was a bit intelligent to believe in some god. If you do worship a god and Jesus then you would probably like this album but for those of you with a bit more intelligence stay away and don't waste your money.
1,"Billy Billy Billy, what happened buddy?","Next time Zwan should print their lyrics on two ply so that it will be softer when I wipe my ass with it. Sometime between Simease Dream and Zwan, Corgan has gone from having one of the most distinctive sounding voices in rock to having one of the most annoying sounding voices in rock. Its not so much that this album is terrible, its just that its boring. Nothing ever really happens, its just kinda bland. Im not asking for Corgan to do another Simease Dream again or anything, all I want is for him to write something that doesnt put me to sleep when im listening to it. So if your reading this Billy, get rid of the Fester Adams look and write some better songs, cause this sh** your putting out now just isn't cutting it."
1,"Ride a BLACK swan? Oh, come now....","Billy, the former Pumpkinhead, tries out a new band with even more turgid results. This one hit the bargain bins faster than you can say ""pumpkin soup"". And what's this ""Ride A Black Swan"" stuff? He takes a perfectly good T. Rex song title and lifts it for his own. So much for originality."
1,one of the worst sounding cds ever recorded,the songs may be decent here but the recording quality is pitiful. your ears will bleed if you want any volume listening to this mess.
5,A GREAT ROCK ALBUM,"For all the smashing pumpkins fans who thought this album was going to suck, think again. It's everything I though it would be and more. Don't miss out on one of the greatest rock albums in years!!"
2,Got to be a joke...,"This CD has got to be a joke. It is so awful. I'm a long time pumpkins fan since, since long before... well.. just for a long time. I first heard this album at a bar in the Village. I dug it, from what i could hear. But now that i have it im wondering what i hear that night! (i wasnt that drunk). This album is a joke! The lyrics just repeat themselves OVER AND OVER AND OVER again on every song. Look, billy doesnt have the sweetest voice. So when he just repeats himself over and over and over again he really gets on your nerves. The music is tight, and brilliant in some songs and some fashions. And there are some great back vocals too that make for an almost ""gish"" feel. But .. ""honestly"" - this album is a joke. Billy's probably laughing his way to the bank. Im down with happy music and his supposed ""emotional transition"" - but this seems fake. Save your money and borrow a friends copy before deciding."
4,He's back.....,"Corgan can write like few can in the music industry. Good for him starting a new band 'Zwan' and making it work as well as he does on this album. This album has great hooks, and ripping guitar, that combination is hard to find in stores nowadays. Zwan is a great new venture for the ex-pumpkin, I can't wait for his next work. This is a solid A-Joseph Dworak"
3,A Welcome Return,"I have always enjoyed Billy Corgan's songwriting sensibilities. I have even grown to like the genuine sincerity in his cracked ping-pong ball of a voice. So I was happy to see that he was recording again but a little surprised to see that he was doing so as a member of a band. I wondered if Zwan would be a 21st century version of Tin Machine with equally disappointing results because, let's face it, B.C. has always been a solo act. I needn't have worried. This is a fine collection of songs. If you are a pumpkin fan you will grow to like this recording, although you might have to try just a bit harder than you would have liked. Somewhere inside of B.C. is that record that will one day be mentioned, or at least argued about, in the same breath as Who's Next or Led Zep IV. This is not it, but it is certainly another solid and enjoyable work."
3,BORING STRAIGHT UP ROCK,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the sound is nice and it includes a dvd. The music is happy straight forward rock. Nothing is really going on here. All the songs sound the same. The best track is the 14 minute one. No one is improvising anything. My 14 year old likes it. My friends think I'm nuts for buying it. I like rock, but this is really an over-hyped disc which, if Billy Corgan wasn't attached to it, would go unnoticed by the general public. I understand that the members of Zwan are good players. If that's true, let them play. I'd like to hear what they can do. The way this is structured, this is Billy Corgan with a back up band. If you want background music, this is your disc, cause there is nothing to listen to."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed after I listened to the cd. Almost every single song just repeated the same words over and over again. I thought the single ""Honestly"" was decent when I heard it on the radio, and I love Smashing Pumpkins so I thought this would be a great cd. However, ""Honestly"" is the best song on the cd. Not discovering a better song on the cd was a bit of a let down. I give this cd 2 stars ONLY because Billy Corgan still has a great voice. Now if only the lyrics were better..."
3,Suprisingly Decent,"WHen I heard of Zwan I thought it would be like the SMashing Pumpkins but when I heard Honestly on MTV I WAS GREATLY DISAPPPIONTED!!! But it grows on you along with some others. I have to admit I didn't buy it yet but I""m going to look for my synopsis when it comes out."
3,"It's a good song, but 14 times in a row.","Billy Corgan's latest offering to the music world has him feeling much happier than I think he has been in quite some time. For that, I am happy for him. Perhaps I am a little over simplistic in the title for my review, but this album certainly has many songs that are similar. There are many bands that have or had a certain sound that permeates the majority of their music (U2, The Strokes, The Smashing Pumpkins, to name a few), but they find ways to mix it up a bit. Zwan fails to mix it up enough. It's a good sound. I like the song, but there isn't enough variety to make it worth one's while."
4,A Rainbow of Rock Sunshine,"After the last skewered and ultimately ill-received last effort of the Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Corgan has produced a fine rock record. Mary Star of the Sea features beautiful guitar work, good vocals, and an awesome back drum beat provided by former Pumpkiner Jimmy Chamberlain. The fact that Zwan sustains the energy of a veteran outfit for over an hour of solid music is a credit to their talent. Highlights of the record include the infectious first single ""Honestly"", the harmonica/acoustic guitar combo of ""Come With Me,"" and the fourteen minute ""Jesus,I/Mary Star of the Sea"" that does not get boring or tedious despite its length. Mary Star of the Sea is a rare rock record these days; it's happy, upbeat tunes do not dissapoint."
2,Disappointing,"I was a big fan of Smashing Pumpkins in high school 5+ years ago. I lost interest in SP, slowly after Melancoly and the Infinite Sadness (excuse me if i spelled that wrong). I heard about this new band. I thought it was pretty cool at first. The more I listen to it, the more I hate it! Its good music to fall asleep too. I dunno maybe my taste has changed a bit?!"
1,Zwan sucks get the pumpkins back....,Come on Billy is this what you broke up the pumpkins for.....shameful.
2,poor,"This cd sounds like it was recorded in the early 80's. You'd think Corgan could afford to use better technolgy. 2 stars for 2 decent songs, zero stars for sound quality. I cant believe no one else has written about this."
1,BILLY! NOOOOOO!,I love SP and billy but when i got this Cd and was all pumped about him back on track and in music again i was like...Wha? I have the Cd and I own it...but I have only listened to it once. I couldnt listen to it another time! NO matter how many times I was told that I should that it is good etc. I couldnt bring myself to do it. Zwan=thumbs down. DONT BUY IT!
2,what is this?,"zwan sucks and the music is just wrong for some reason.. corgan should have stopped music all together and get a job at the gas station because this album and band is rotting the life of smashing pumkins,,, the only reason i even gave this 2 stars is because billy corgan is in the band."
1,Not as Advertised,"All this book does is show examples of built museums... these are not case studies. There is no investigation/analysis/questioning of what was built and why. It only gives you a small amount of information about the many museums we are already familiar with, and shows plans and drawings that are either too small or irrelevant. I would only use this to become familiar with some of the worlds modern museums, but you could also just find that on the internet. Beyond the case studies there is nothing else, no narrative, no discussion of specific program issues, no technical discussion of lighting, acoustics, way finding, etc. etc. Truly a joke unfortunately. Do not buy this if you actually want to learn about how to properly plan and design a museum."
2,"Not good when compared to other books in the ""Building Type Basics"" series","I own 4 books from Building Type Basics Series. They are Retail Facility, Hospitality Facility, Theater Facility and Museum Facility. So far, I considered this Museum Facility Book as the worst of all 4. For Retail, Hospitality and Theater, these three have a lot of generic information such as historical background of building type, space component, principles of design, etc. They also give a lot of examples based on those generic issues, topic by topic. In this Museum book, it is all about examples with plans and very little background information for each museums. There are a lot of pictures and plans which are not of good quality (I actually didn't expect them to be because it is not the strength of the series). I intended to buy this book (which is expensive) to obtain pure information. I did not get it either.All I can say is, this book is not up to the par with the others in the same series that I own."
1,A waste of money....,"So, I purchased this book without reading the ""fine print"" that says there are no illustrations in the book. So, essentially, it is a listing of the pieces in the collection with descriptions of various pieces that cannot be seen because ....you guessed it - THERE ARE NO ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PIECES.In my opinion, this makes this book pretty worthless. The book was originally written to illustrate this superb collection of pottery, but without the illustrations, it really is a waste of paper. A scan of the original book, with illustrations, can be found on the internet for free as a PDF download."
4,The real story of Catch 22,"This is an well-written account which, although it does occasionally get bogged down in the mass of detail which Brookes has accumulated on this crucial but often ignored episode of the war, concentrates equally on the human side, and on the effects on those servicemen involved, both Allied and Axis . As far as is possible in this type of historical writing, Brookes allows the men involved to tell their own story in their own words. The informal, almost chatty style of Brookes' writing makes this a riveting read from start to finish."
2,Movie Maker for Dummies,Book price was outrageously high priced as it was out of print. Information not particularly new or helpful beyond what is provided by on-line searches. Sold on e-Bay for a fraction of my cost and I hope new buyer got what they paid for.
5,class material,"I used this book when I taught how to make movies at the High school and college level. It covers all you need to know, and is easy to read and follow. It covers lighting, framing, camera settings and yes hold it steady. It adds how to change or correct colors, focus, add music, e mail it and much more. It is very informative and easy to follow.Microsoft Windows Movie Maker for DummiesIt is out of print now and general average in used book stores is about 25 to 30 dollars for a decent condition book."
3,OLC Rules,This CD is OK but it hasen't got the edge that the OLC has.The singing is very good by all of the pop singers but I feel as I saw the show before getting this album that the songs don't have the emotion that the cast recording has.I must admit that the song Whistle Down the Wind is sung amazingly by both Tina Arena and Lottie Maylor but some of the others like No matter what by boyzone is poorGET THE LONDON CAST RECORDING INSTEAD
1,PAYROLLCLERK,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM AND IN FACT RETURNED IT. I CALLED THE COMPANY THAT SENT IT TO ME AND TOLD THEM THE BILLFOLD DID NOT HAVE THE ITEMS THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE AND IT ARRIVED VERY LATE.HOWEVER, THE COMPANY GAVE ME A VERY PROMPT COMPLETE REFUND, AND I REALLY APPRECIATED THIS."
2,Mildew,"Bought 2 of these so I could protect the brand new cushions on my outside patio furniture. Superbowl weekend, we decided to have everyone over for a bbq & watch the game outside. When setting up the patio we pulled the cushions out and they were ALL covered in mildew. The bags on the inside are all full of mildew as well. So here it is Superbowl & bbq with folded up blankets on our outside furniture. What heated me even more is that the cushions are not zippered on so I cant even take the covers off to wash them.I was going to give 1 star but because the covers are as thick as described im giving 2 stars."
2,Did not meet expectations,Thin material and poor zippers-I bought 5 and 2 zippers pulled out: they should be more clear with the number and size of cushions it can hold
3,So far so good.,"I wanted to get something to put our cushions in so that I wouldn't have to constantly go into our shed to get them. I didn't want one of the crates that they sell, I thought it might take up too much of the deck and this is light weight enough that I can move around easily when company comes."
1,bag looks nice.....that's about it.....,I was happy when I opened the box. The bag looked nice and sturdy....I put the cushions in with no problem. Then I tried to zip it shut and both zipper pulls broke away from the zipper. I didn't have too many cushions in the bag. I wasn't rough. I used no more strength than zipping up a coat. I am very disappointed with the quality. What a waste of money....by the time I send it back I may as well buy another someplace else......:-(
3,Great idea - construction could be better,"Holds less than I thought it would and a seam broke immediately. Partially my fault for trying to force the cushions, which should be able to be placed in the bag. Will probably buy another brand next time. Guess you get what you pay for. The inexpensive price attracted me to the item."
2,Disappointed,The bag is large and the material is very steady -- but it is not even close to water proof. Lots of water seeps into the bag which mostly defeats the purpose of having a cushion storage bag!
1,Wet Cushions,I ordered these bags to put cushions in because the product information states that the cushions would stay dry. I just checked inside the bag after it rained a couple of days ago an all of the cushions are wet. I hope this $400 worth of cushions dry!
5,Fantastic quality,"I bought these with a bbq cover on the 3 for 4 sale. The light color does seem to capture dirt, but overall, these are made really, really well. Great value."
3,Patio Cushion Storage Bag,"I think the product is very sturdy except for the zipper pull which came off as I was zipping up the cushions. Now, I can't zip."
1,Smaller than advertised,"The first one I recieved was the perfect size but the zipper did not stay closed. Amazon sent me a replacement and this one was smaller than the first and did not fit the chase cushion. Amazon sent me a third one but it too was not large enough for a chase cushion. Good quality but not accurate sze. I gave up and will keep this one for seat cushions only, certainly not what I wanted to purchase."
4,The best alternative to expensive cushion chests,"The Veranda Patio Chushion bag will keep your cushions protected from dust and pet hair - and the musty smell of a basement in the off season. It's not as stylish or efficient as the wooden storage chests but it's also a fraction of the cost. I have a sofa and loveseat from Frontgate and the bottom cushions are on the large side. The Veranda bag can accommodate the awkward sizes but it's important to measure your cushions to determine how many bags you'll need. For the sofa, loveseat, 4 accessory pillows (12"") and 4 armchair cushions, I needed three bags. They take up a big part of the room but it was the only option I had. It's a little awkward getting them in and out of the bag but once you have a routine, you don't think twice about it. At least my cushions will stay protected year-round! If you don't want to spend $1000 on storage chests, I would definitely recommend the Veranda bag."
4,"Great pictures, high resolution, but small screen","This camera is great. It was cheaper than most 4-5 MP cameras and it takes stunningly detailed pix. It can also record short video clips. My only problem with it is that the LCD is too small at only 1.5"". Otherwise, it's a great value!"
2,VERY Short life span on this camera....11 mos.,"After 11 months the camera is dead. The LCD screen is nothing but a white screen. I agree with a previous post about battery life. We would go through so many AA batteries. The camera never seemed to have enough charge. The controls are not so user friendly. Every function has a symbol, but we could never figure out what that symbol meant. Palm Tree, Half Moon, Lightning bolt with a line through it, monkey heads, birthday cake, we could never figure that stuff out."
3,Its alright.,"When i bought this camera last year i was satisfied with it. Mainly because i never owned one previously before. Now that i own more i can leave an opinion.The one thing about it that surprised me was that it didnt have macro shot. and if it does,i cant find it anywhere. Because the screen is so small,the words are tiny and the menu isnt the best to navigate.It does take excellent pictures though if the picture modes are in the correct order for the atmosphere your in. And the video is very crisp and clear. My biggest problem with it is that it eats the batteries up real fast. The menu,thats ok. The small screen,thats ok too,especially for the price. But the battery life is disappointing. Oberall i score it 3 stars."
5,"It's really SMALL, but NEAT!","After using a much bigger digital camera, I was shocked when I saw such a small little bugger. Really compact, just filled with Sony electronic mastery. Suggest you buy with this the small carrying case and the cardreader that plugs into your USB port. Really simple to download on Ebay and Emails. I have been really pleased with the quality of the picture. I didn't like the PhotoShop program that came with it, so bought the upgrade to do more accurate detailing in pictures. Don't forget to get a big card for this unit...you will definitely like it. By the way, I lost my directions the very first day, but it is a self-teaching camera...and not too hard to figure all the different options. Have fun with your camera!"
2,White blank screen quick fix,White blank screen quick fix.Try turning off the camera and briskly taping the front of the camera in the palm of your hand a few times. Many DSC-S40 cameras seem to have the same problem. Sony service does not admit to ever hearing of this problem. Bad Service
2,"Nice pictures, as long as the camera lasts (~1 year)","I too, loved the camera, despite the small LCD screen size, until it got the infamous White Screen of Death that this particular camera is known for, which usually occurs AFTER the warranty expires (1 year). Photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but I paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80). Small LCD screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable AA batteries lasted a long time.White screen of death temporary solution: Turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the ""Cybershot"" logo on the front of the camera. Then turn it back on. Repeat if necessary. It'll probably happen again, but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop."
1,no battery life,"This camera is a lot larger and more clunky than it appears. When you put in batteries they last for about 10 seconds. So you can't review pictures on the camera for any length of time. I would not reccomend that you buy this, becuase it dies periodically. Even if the batteries are fresh, it dies and nothing you do can bring it to life."
2,Malfunctioned within months of purchase,This is the second brand new Sony Cybershot we purchased and I was very disappointed. Images on the creen became distorsioned and had to send to repair and cost was not worth it. Will never buy another Sony digital camera again
3,2013!!,i bought this at a thrift shop for $4! i would NEVER pay $200 for this camera..... its ok but very outdated...
4,Great Camera. Sony should be making more of these.,The best Camera sony ever made. we had one but it was dropped and the screen went out. we wanted to find one exactly like it and this has worked out great.
2,"Was a top rated in 2005, failed the test of time","I purchased the Sony DSC-S40 for $199 in July of 2005 and it performed very well for several months. The addition of a memory card and lowering the resolution allowed me to take more pictures than I could ever need at any one time. Picture quality was superior to my previous digital of similar pixels and the movie feature worked far beyond my expectations.After a customer service suggested ""reset"" due to a screen malfunction, the camera performed for a total of 14 months before the white screen of death appeared. The camera was repaired for free (due to completing a product registration card and having logged the calls to customer service) and worked for four more months before being left for dead."
2,Poor reliability of the display,"This camera was working just fine until last week when the display went blank. I really like the camera and was hoping to keep it for a long time. I bought SONY because of my past experience on other products such as TV, stereos, DVD but unfortunately SONY really disappointed me with their digital camera quality. I was not expecting a Japanese made product such as Sony to be of such low quality (for the display). I read some of the other complaints and I was not surprised to read that most everybody had the same white display issue I have. I am a quality engineer myself and I can tell Sony did not perform a DFMEA or any of the other Six Sigma tools on this camera. My first thought was that this camera was made in China but to my surprise it was made in Japan....what happened to SONY's quality?"
3,Camera works when it wants to.,"This camera, when it wants to work is really quality, both the photos and the videos. I have also been having problems with keeping the camera on as well. for no reason it turns off and will not come back on for an hour or more. Some days there are no problems with it at all. It wears down batteries quicker than any thing I have ever seen before as well. I am thinking about getting the charger for it, but I am not sure if its worth it for a camera that shuts off half the time."
1,"Big disapointment, shame on Sony!","Like others, mine will review pictures but shuts off almost immediately when in I turn it on in still mode. Bought in December 2005, it is now not working. It is scandalous that so many of us have the same issue and Sony is not addressing it. Sony should be forced to recall these cameras."
3,Downside,"I bought this for my family cruise and although the daytime pictures were magnificent....the nighttime indoors pictures were blurred and appeared to resemble double vision.Additionally, if you dont have a flat screen monitor, take into account that the pictures on the camera lcd will appear different on your monitor and will require you to brighten the photographs on a program not included in the bundle.I LOVE THIS CAMERA FOR DAYTIME PHOTOS but when it comes to indoor photos with no natural light....this camera is awful."
1,"Hoorible Camera, Horrible Service","I had this camera and no problems for the first six months. At that point, the LCD screen on the back went white, not allowing me to review pictures, access the menu, or take pictures through it. I've sent the camera to Sony repair centers twice, with no results. The camera has spent three of the past four months either in transit, in repair, or simply not working. If you're going to spend any kind of money on a camera, do yourself a favor and don't buy a Sony."
1,Poor reliability,I would never recommend this camera to anyone. The reliability is horrible. We had to send it in twice under warranty to fix a faulty diplay screen and now that it is just out of warranty the screen has stopped working again. I don't think I will ever buy anything made by Sony again.
2,Short Life Span,"I have had this camera for 11 months now and back in the market for a new camera. At 5 months, the screen started to go white and I could not access any photos, I could take pictures but not view/erase or even access the menu. Sony wanted the camera back (seemed to be a common problem on the website). We learned that if we shook that camera the picture came back long enough to access the menu. For 6 months this has been going and and now the camera is shot.Battery life was VERY short, but we used rechargeable batteries so it was not much of a problem for us."
4,Happy with it.,It takes very nice pictures. The only thing I'd dislike is it seem a little heavy compared with my previous Nikkon.
1,worst Sony buy ever,"had this camera two weeks, its rubbish......just shuts down all the time.. i own many many sony products and never had a problem before with any of them...you get so used to a good brand that you dont question the products they make any more...so i was really shocked when this product is total ( Dogs doo) change it if you have just bought one..."
2,Very bad battery life,I bought 4 of these cameras as gifts and all of them stopped working after 3-4 days (about 5 pictures taken). After investigating it turns out the batteries SONY packs with these cameras are sub-standard and discharge within 3-4 days.The support claims that the included batteries are only for immediate use only and we should buy new batteries anyway. That is pretty bad product policy.Wish I had bought a Nikon or Canon with rechargable batteries.
1,S.Kurtz,"Yes, I have had this camera a little over a year and I am experiencing the same white screen. The Sony customer service only recommends that I remove the batteries and hold the power button down for 20 seconds. Funny how that is supposed to fix every problem I've had. I have had two pesty problems plague me the whole year - white screen (nice temporary reset tip given in the other reviews) and that the camera won't turn on at all. If you purchase this camera ... take all the pictures you want for a year, then toss it in the trash."
1,"Lousy, DO NOT BUY!!","This camera seemed fine when I first got it. A little but bulky and I would've preferred if the view screen was bigger, but it was on sale for $150 so I was satisfied. I had it about 10 months and the screen went out on it, I could still take pictures but the viewscreen was completely white... kind of a necessary feature for a camera. So I sent it in under warranty, they ""fixed"" it I suppose, and sent it back. It last another 3 months until it was no longer under warranty, and then did the same thing. And now it won't even turn on. I would think this was just a bad camera in the batch, but the same thing happened to my friend with this camera, so I don't know if they had problems making them or what.All I can say is, I recommend not buying it if you'd like your camera to last longer than a year."
4,Daughter Loves the Present,"Perfect for my 12 year old, it seems. Nice to have a zoom. Regarding memory, the internal memory is decent for photographs, and will probably hold a few dozen depending on your settings (less if you save movies). But if you want more capacity, you'll need to buy a memory stick. You might want to replace the included AA's with new alkalines.SUBSEQUENT WARNING: Several months after getting this camera, we ran into an error message that locked us out, and shortly thereafter ran into the whited out LCD problem, both of which problems we learned much more about from Google. They're erratic, but very annoying."
1,Broke after 1 week,"This camera worked wonderfully for the one week it was operational. Then the motor that powers the lens spontaneously died, making awful sounds and was suddenly unable to make the lens extend or close the protective shutter when the power was off. Sony has been just awful to deal with: after sending it in to be repaired and being told Sony would pay for the repair & shipping, I received a bill for $171 before they would even start my repair. I am still arguing with Sony Customer Service about this, and am becoming doubtful that I'll ever see the camera again.Being able to take a defective item back to the store of purchase is wonderful--I will therefore seriously reconsider buying any more Sony electronics."
1,1 year disposable camera,"Ironically, I just took the camera to the repair shop b/c on a recent trip the screen turned white. I learned that I need a new LCD. I have had the camera for one year, and am disappointed. It worked great for one year but now is trash."
1,great at first,"I brought this camera almost a year ago. At first it was great... just what i wanted. Soon the LCD started to turn white. Usually it would fix on its own, at the expense tht I couldnt take pictures at that moment. It's Black Friday this week, perhaps i will get a new camera"
2,"White Screen of Death (yes, me too)","I bought this camera about a year and a half ago and LOVED it until the screen started shorting out. It started slowly...and then finally died entirely. I have tried (and tried, and TRIED) the advice given in the previous review on resetting the camera...NOTHING. Do NOT buy this camera, it's not worth it if it is only going to last a year...Read the other reviews. This happens to everyone after almost exactly one year. Nice."
4,Not as small as I thought,"Well, just got this camera 2 days ago. Used it quite a bit for my daughters swimming lesson this morning.My old Sony DSC-S50 was just too big to be convienient and finally we upgraded to this newer model.Photos - excellent. I used a 2.1 MP for so long, a 4.1 really is a lot crisper. Cropping in photoshop leaves a much better image now.Video - excellent. Memory Stick Pro on FINE mode makes for excellent video with sound. Sure does chew through the space though. 512 MB stick holds just 6 minutes of video.I dropped a single star because I was thinking this camera would be about the same size as the L1, but it really is quite a bit thicker. It still fits in your jeans pocket, just not as slim as I was planning.We'll keep it - maybe upgrade in another couple of years."
1,Does not work!,"I had the same problem as a previous reviewer. The camera stopped working pretty much the same day as I got it. It turned off randomly by itself, with the lense cover open. However, since the lense was open, the camera would not turn back on until after very many tries. Then, it would only turn on in review mode, but as soon as you switch it to camera mode, it would shut off again. I thought my camera was defective so Amazon.com sent me a replacement. The replacement camera did the same thing!I have to note that when it actually did work, it was easy to use, and the pictures were great. I just wish that it worked properly."
3,Flash & Focus difficulties,"I love having a lightweight Sony Cybershot to carry around with me. The only problems I've found, so far, are with the focus and the flash. Even with its distance measuring technology, the flash is never just right. It's hit or miss if the shot will be dark or washed out or just right, and sometimes the camera doesn't focus at all.The flash is also quite fond of capturing dust orbs. In some photos there are hundreds of them. That's a bit disappointing, but for the price, and for what I'm using it for, I guess I can't complain too much.I will say it is nowhere near as nice as I was hoping. I trust Sony completely and my professional digital camera is a Sony, so I was expecting a little more."
1,Do Not Buy This Camera,"The Cybershot DSCS40 was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter in 2005. A few days after Christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning. Because the camera was shipped in November 2005, Sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $111. Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Sony product in the future."
2,Great till the LCD goes,Great camera for one year. The screen went white once but from what I hear (read) it will get worse. One fix I read was to hit it on the logo. Haven't tried it cause it's working fine for the moment.
2,LCD screen dying after one year is not a myth,"I purchased this camera one year ago. The LCD screen started having minor problems, I should have gotten it replaced immediately. Now the LCD screen is completely dead. I never dropped the camera or anything.Other than that, the camera was perfect. It surpassed my expectations, except for the LCD dying. I would have given it 4-5 stars otherwise, but paying $250 bucks for a camera that lasts only one year is not fair at all."
2,bad,"bad very bad, i bought two and both screens went white, sometimes they just turn off for fun. I'm out $450 because of sony. if i see sony on the street im gonna punch in the vagina."
3,Good product with QC problem,"This is a fairly good point-and-shoot at $170. Decent usable 4MP, great battery life, and pocket size. However, after about two years I got the dreaded ""white screen"" this July. Knowing it will take $120 to repair by Sony I decided to buy a S650 instead. After reading the reviews about the white screen, I gave it a try and it is fixed after one tap!I had the same problem with the smaller U30 and it was repaired for free. Both are made in Japan yet have the similar problem. I guess the country of origin doesn't necessarily mean bullet proof quality any more.I am glad it works again and it will be my back up camera."
1,Not recommended,"I have bought two Sony Cybershot digital cameras within the past three years, and was very very disappointed.At first everything seemed great, but the first one just stopped working within about eighteen months for no discernable reason, and refused to function any more. There was no point sending it off to Sony as they'd charge for repairs and for that cost I might as well buy a replacement which is why I bought the second one.About fifteen months later exactly the same thing happened, it just stopped working. Now, I am extremely careful with my electrical goods and proof of that is that I still have electrical items from twenty-five years ago in perfect condition, so I knew the problem wasn't me but Sony.I'll never buy their cameras again."
4,Good overview of many microphone topics,"I'm an electrical/acoustical engineer working with component microphones. This book has a good overview of a lot of microphone topics, from design to use. The math and physics in the book isn't too in-depth, so it's easy to read, but it doesn't always cover the material to the detail that I need. The basic information that it does have, though, is a good springboard to reading other more in-depth books or papers on specific topics."
2,Steals the beauty of art,"Like speaking with a doctor, not a fun book, very very interesting information done boring."
3,Not the Best but Still Fun,"Unlike many of Feist previous efforts there is nothing creative about this except in the general story line. The characters and intriuge were all a little to formula but still interesting enough to keep me wanting more. If you are a fan of Feist you will enojoy but if this is your first time to read his books, start with another..."
2,Feist couldn't have written this book,"I'll keep it short and... not so sweet: this book isn't very good at all. I've been a huge Raymond Feist fan for 15-20 years and I can't believe he wrote this book. More than likely, his name and universe are all the input he had. The characters are wooden, one dimensional, and utterly predictable. The main character is wholly unlikable and the ""tough, moody hero who lost his family"" thing is way overdone.I was really looking forward to this book because I figured you'd have the world of Midkemia mixed with a writer who has written military books in the past.Chocolate and peanut butter, I mused? Chocolate and soy sauce more like.The last few chapters in particular, while predictable, were a complete let down.If you're trolling for a good read and have never read Feist, start with Magician: Apprentice - you won't be disappointed! If you start here, you'll never read Feist again.Ok, so maybe that wasn't so short."
4,Honoured Enemy (Legends of the Riftwar),HAD TO ORDER THIS BOOK TO COMPLETE THE SERIES. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO READ A SERIES FROM BACK TO FRONT OR THE MIDDLE OUT. IT WAS NICE TO KNOW THAT AMAZON HAD IT AVAILABLE.
5,A great pairing,"This is certainly the best book in the Legends of the Riftwar series. The story could easily stand on its own without any knowledge of Feist's work - though obviously it would be more enjoyable to those familiar with the Riftwar. The saving of Hartraft's soul may have seemed a bit contrived, but in the lessons of tolerance and learning from would-be enemies could be fantastic for young-adult readers."
5,This is what Fantasy should be about!,"I really don't think this is a 5 star but it is better than a 4! Feist is writing at the level here of his original trilogy and the Serpent War Trilogy! I want to warn you, although this does take place on Midkemia, it isn't about his characters in his previous books! The story flows very smoothly with tons of action and it is a great war novel! That is what it is, it a a story of the Rift War and it was way overdue! There are some items that are trademark Feist, you find in a lot of his stories but if you are a fan of his, you don't mind them. He does good character development and has you taking sides quickly and then understanding the other side before you know it and cheering for them! I strongly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed!!!"
4,Honored Enemy,"I must admit I was a little concerned about this book, since it was ""co-written"" by William R. Forstchen. I had to wonder just how different this book would be from the ""regular"" books. Well, not too much. The story was crisp and moved along at a nice pace. The authors killed off characters with the usual alomb, and it kept me interested until the end.My only criticisms are that the story was a little too predictable, and I thought they tried too hard to tie this story in with MAGICIAN. It seemed like every once in a while they would throw in a few pages harking back to the classic, just to prove they were still in Midkemia; the story would have been better without. However, it was a mere annoyance, and overall I enjoyed the book and can't wait for the rest of the series!"
4,Honoured Enemy,"This story was a great background story to other books by the author. The ending was a little corny, and contrite. Too many bows tied neatly, but maybe that was what Raymond Feist was looking to build, a complete story of two characters - enemies drawn together. Never the less, love all books from this author."
2,Don't buy this tent.,"This tent is cheap and the frame is weak. Ours only lasted one night and collapsed with TWO shattered poles in a mild thunderstorm. It can't even hold itself up! Waste of money, and customer service was rude and Wenzel's warranty is useless, you will not get your money back. Don't buy this tent."
2,Do not buy this tent.,This tent is cheap and will not hold up in rain and wind. Ours only lasted one night and collapsed with TWO shattered poles in a mild thunderstorm. The frame is weak!! Do not buy this tent.
1,junk,"I bought this tent thinking I could trust the Wenzel name for quality. On the second campout, some of the poles split. I used duct tape to reinforce them, even the ones that didn't split, and got 2 more campouts out of it. On the 4th and last campout, one of the poles snapped (moderate to gusty wind, not one of the split poles). When it snapped, it caused the pole holding the fly on the side to let loose, which then ripped the fly.It is easy to set up, even for one person. And, it has plenty of room to stand up in. But I've gotten better (more) use out of cheaper tents."
5,A Lovely & Timely Biography!,Anne Bradstreet is virtually unknown--but not after this engrossing and well-researched biography! The author has carefully crafted a beautiful book about the life of this great woman of the early American days. A wonderful book!
4,Great bungee cord for camping!,"I purchased the Fat Strap in a shorter length to use for camping and I truly like the cords. In particular, I have used them on my son's and my backpack frame to secure bedrolls to the lower frame. The wide strap helps stabilize the loads better than conventional bungees and the plastic coated hook doesn't scratch, rust or corrode.The only downside I could find is the fact that the hook doesn't bend so you can permanently secure a cord to a frame or anchor point, but that's not a big deal. My son did manage to lose two cords (he's 11 and loses everything), but I used zip ties to secure them to his backpack frame. Problem solved. The enlarged hook does allow you to secure the cord to larger anchor points.This is a good cord that works quite well."
5,More than satisfied,"The order came promptly. I knew I would be pleased with the product because I have the book already. This was a gift for my brother, who does a Big Band show. He loved it, and I am completely satisfied."
5,one of the best,This is one of the best death metal albums in history.The vocals are just insane. You have to get this album if you like any kind of metal!!
3,Very good music but what the hell!,"I love Kataklysm's music, but what the hell is with the lead singer!? He dosen't know how to keep a beat. Maurizio is soooo much better. And don't diss on my review if you disagree, I have a right to my opinion."
2,Zune Wireless Remote,Not impressed with this and I don't recommend it to anyone. Sorry but the battery dies way too fast and it's very hard to control.
1,Zune Remote,"I bought a Zune dock and remote, designed to work together. My player works fine in the dock, but the remote has no effect, doesn't work at all. I will try a new battery, but that shouldn't be the problem given that it is brand new out of the box. The worst part is that there is absolutely no place to ask anyone what the problem might be; the Microsoft website doesn't address this issue. It could be the battery, or some sort of set-up issue, or it could just be a bad unit. Really disappointing. I think it would work if I could find out what is wrong, as so many others seem to have had success, but for now at least, I am really dissatisfied with the product AND the support system."
4,Handy remote for Zune,It is very convenient to use the remote to change the playing options on the zune. I really like it and recommend it to other Zune owners.
1,IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK,THE REMOTE REQUIRES THE BASE AND DOES NOT WORKIT FUNCTIONED FOR MINUTES AND AFTER 3 TIMES OF BATTERY CHANGE IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.
3,question,can anyone tell me if this remote works with the dock for the second generation zunes? im getting an 8 gb and I want to know if this will be the right remote for the dock
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This product arrived wrapped in bubble wrap (no original box or packaging), AND without any instruction/owners manual. Even worse, it didn't work and my 'really cool tech-like Christmas gift' for my husband has now been added to our collection of old remotes."
1,Pole came apart and easily jams,"The shear jams easily and is difficult to free once it jams.The pole clamp is poorly designed. It clamps to the outer telescoping tube instead of being glued, which allows the outer tube to easily separate from the clamp because the outer telescoping tube is thin and will not withstand much clamping force and the clamp is made from slick plastic.I spent so much time freeing jams and trying to keep the pole together that I discarded it after three uses. It was not worth the frustration.Fiskars may make good scissors but they make a lousy pole saw."
1,Tree Pruner,This pruner is so easy to use. It cut through the branches that were almost 3 inches thick with no problem. Easy to pull and cut with ease. Extends long enough to stand on the ground and not have to worry about falling off a ladder.3 MONTHS USING ABOUT 3 TIMES AND IT BROKE. THE WHOLE HEAD CAME OFF. THIS WAS CUTTING SMALL LIMBS ON A DEAD TREE. NOT FISKARS QUALITY.
4,lost part,"I love the pruner but the plug (stopper) at the bottom of the handle/pole came out and is lost. It's the thing on the end of the handle that keeps the telescoping inter-pole (white) from moving as you use the pruner. Now, the entire pruner is useless because I can't find a replacement for this relatively minor part. Any help would be appreciated."
3,cutter for trees,"lucky to get a year out of this.. rope tears or doesnt fit on pully after about 4-5 uses,makes it slow to use as you have to keep repositioning the rope."
2,"Does not fit on a regular wood Browning Gold 12, just Synthetic type","This HiViz XCoil Browning Gold PreFit Recoil Pad does not fit on a regular wood Browning Gold but just on a Synthetic type. I hope I knew it before buying this as a gift, very disappointed with the product."
3,HiViz XCoil Browning Gold PreFit Recoil Pad,"Pretty close to the real thing but requires some modification, under the circumstances I am not entirely dissappointed"

You will enjoy reading her story as she changes into an independent caring and fulfilled woman.While reading this book you will feel like you are reading someone's personal journal. It is well written with plenty of details on how Rachel comes to the decisions she does. It is also written so you can understand all the characters around her and how they fit or don't fit into her life. An excellent read I was sad to see end!I was given this book by christianreviewofbooks.com to review
4,A woman's journey guided by God.,"This is a story of an amazing woman named Rachel who through lifes trials and tribulations never loses her focus on God's plan for her life. She is someone that all may learn from and or relate to in some way. Plus, the story line and characters keep your attention and you just can't wait to read what delicious food will be introduced next! It's a must read!"
1,Not impressive in any way,"The image on the vase is PRINTED on cheaply, rather than being painted on. The dots from the printing are quite visible upon a reasonably close inspection. Prepare to be let down if you purchase this vase."
4,Delicious but a little small,"These were phenomenally delicious! However the jar is a little smaller than I expected. Not at all a bad deal, but don't be fooled by the picture; use the weight for reference. A 1lb. bag of M&Ms and this are about the same."
5,expresso coffee beans - Emily,Really good dark chocolate - perfectly roasted coffee beans - nice packaging for storage.Will always order these!!!
2,Not what we expected,"I ordered the CD edition for my mom for Christmas. I decided to give it to her early and I'm glad I did! The CD is not the same songs as the vinyl. However, the CD had fairly cute music so we decided to keep it. I'm hesitant to order the vinyl in case it's the wrong one."
1,Made me feel sick to listen to,"I'm a fan of many different styles of music from different eras, but I do have a discriminating taste. I like good music, this is bad... real bad. A half-a$$ disco tune with horrible vocals. It sounds like a couple of tone deaf 14 year old girls singing along with ""Staying Alive"", while managing to butcher one of the most well respected classic rock anthems of all time. ""Comfortably Numb"" should have never been twisted into this hideous beast of trite rythm and harmony, a clumsy regurgitation of what was once good. It makes me sick thinking of the people who bought this twaddle and made it a best selling single. Shameful."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I got this unit because my house was broken in recently. Sadly, this unit disappointed me in almost every aspect. First, the unit is extremely difficult to setup (despite the very detail manual on how-to). You need to connect the unit to a router first and assign IP address via Panasonic app. Second, you NEED power outlet for each of the webcam. Most likely, you'll never have a power outlet where you want to place the unit. Third, the unit does not support WPA protocol, just WEP, which is not very secure. Lastly, this unit is OLD model. There is a new model that support WPA. Also, if you search Amazon carefully, there is an identical product with a lower price. I finally opted for a wired (q-see) webcam system.The only bright spot is Amazon.com customer service is OUTSTANDING. They answered all question and helping return."
2,All the joy of a warmup exercise...,"I've been in love with the Bach 'cello suites for about 30 years, so I'm always curious when I see a new rendition. This version was a real disappointment. The sound is rough, scratchy, and harsh -- with just a hint of ""wolfing."" He sounds like he's punishing the instrument rather than making it sing.And then there's his questionable use of rubato. It's as if the performer needs to linger on a note every once in awhile to catch his breath. Maybe it's just an attempt to hide a technical failure. Who knows. It demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of these beautiful suites.Overall, listening to this recording is a really unpleasant experience. Check out Fournier, or Casals, or Yo Yo Ma instead."
5,Five Stars For Five Stars.,"A living, breathing time capsule. Totally unpolished, unprofessional, and totally captivating. The raw power exuding from this fairly short film far surpasses the computerized, polished, sleeping pill videos of today. Big Brother is one of the most under-rated bands of all time. Yes, when you think of them, you of course immediatley think of Janis. But the fact that Janis was at her best during her time with B.Bro. says alot for the band. The sight of this ragged, tiny, unknown little girl, unleashing a hint of her soon -to- be greatness and ambition, is palpable. And the between-music banter is interesting and fun, with the intelligence in Janis' eyes very clear, in retrospect. I met all the guys from Big Bro. a few years ago in concert, they were terriffic, real gentlemen, and GREAT musicians, who've only improved with time. Though not necessarily as powerful a performance as Monterey, it's still a film worth having, a sweet postcard from a sadly by-gone era."
5,These are awesome!,PanSaver EZ Clean Multi Use Cooking Bags and Slow Cooker LinersThese have been a huge help in the kitchen. They work well in the crock pot or oven pan or casserole dish. Makes clean up a snap!
4,Good value,"We use the liners both in our slow cooker, but also whenever we bake under 425 degrees. The liners help keep our pans clean, and have never failed."
2,"Dated, superficial analysis","Benson has been completely passed by a number of other products, both online or off. His analysis of minor leaguers is superficial, and his understanding and presentation of the material is clearly inferior to people like John Sickels, the Baseball Prospectus team, and Ron Shandler. This book is indicative of laziness, both in terms of putting together the cursory, ill-researched commentary, and the scope of material presented. For the same price, you can buy a much better book.I've been a Benson fan for years, but this is the last one of his books I'll be purchasing. There is no single thing in this book that you can't get, often at a higher quality, for free, on the web.There is absolutely no reason to purchase this book instead of STATS' Minor League Scouting Report. None whatsoever.Save your money. I wish I did."
2,Benson From A to B,"While John Benson was a pioneer - along with Glenn Waggoner - in perpetrating the growth of Fantasy Baseball through their publications time, technology, and passion seem to have deserted Mr. Benson in his lackluster coverage of minor league players."
4,YUCK,"While not heavy with details, the subject matter is so disgusting that one wonders what the hell were the Japanese thinking. Too bad they didn't stay home and indulge their scientific enthusiasms on themselves. Letting it all hang out can be a mistake."
5,"bloody facts, guts wrenching story","the arocity commited by jap and the war launched by them is a sign of jap culture, people all over the world should be careful, they attacked China, russia, US, UK, Germany without any sign, just pure dirty stabing from the behind.maybe it's right to use A bomb by President Truman!"
5,unit 731 Testimony,"loved the book, and the speedy delivery from Amazon was OUTSTANDING!!! would buy from them again and again"
2,Disappointing,"I'm up for a good adventure as the next person and I do enjoy exploring new and interesting places, but I'm afraid that this game leaves a great deal to be desired. While the pictures are pretty, it does nothing to help the fact that the directions are confusing and I was constantly getting stuck trying to figure out how to get to the next part. There are things you have to do that you have no idea to do them because it's never pointed out that you need to do it and there's no one to ask for hints or help. This is the only game I've ever had to find a walk through for and it left me feeling very disappointed in not only myself, but in the game. I do NOT recommend this game unless you like the feeling of frustration."
1,Hated It,I did not like this game at all. I don't like communicating with still pictures. There is no direction for you to follow. You could wander around for a long time not knowing where to go and what to do. This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
1,atrocious,"This is the worst PC game I have ever played. I'm very suspicious of the ""reviewers"" up here giving it 5 stars. Don't waste your money on this pile."
1,Save Your Money,"I purchased this game based on the only review (5 stars) posted at the time. It didn't hurt that it was a brand new release with alluring packaging.This game is truly awful.Tedious, not worth your time nor the cost. It's only redeeming quality would be the many photos of Capri. Implausible premise, bad voice acting, outdated design technique. Save your money."
4,Enjoyable -- For Some,"The dialogue and voice acting are weak, and wandering through screens and screens of beautiful location shots slow the pace. However, I find these add to the dreamlike feeling of the story -- very Italian. The previous game I played had too many timed puzzles and life-or-death moments for my tastes, along with up-to-the-minute yet annoying navigation. AnaCapri is the perfect antidote: a game you can enjoy for the ample opportunities to explore a beautiful place with a good plot and puzzles that are enjoyable, not frustrating. If you want an action-packed ride with sizzling effects, look elsewhere. AnaCapri is for relaxing and enjoying on its own terms."
1,Anacapri The Dream -,"If the idea of putting you to sleep was the basis of this game, then they have succeeded. This game is extremely boring. The point and click action in this game becomes tiring. At least later you can flash transport from one area to another. The acting is horrible as well as the music soundtrack. The storyline moves slowly, and I moved aimlessly around for the longest time before having to resort to obtaining a cheat. The game description sounded like it would be fun, but that has not been the case. This has been move like a travel site with lots of pretty pictures. I would not recommend this game but would like to visit Anacapri."
5,Nyko Airflo Controller,"This is a very good controller! It has an adjustable meter for how strong you want the air to flow on your hands. The cord is also 10 feet long, much longer than an original gamecube controller. This controller is also a lot bigger than an original one, but it is still comfortable to hold."
2,Not what I expected,"What I thought would be Pete Fountain playing the clarinet turned out to be not only Pete playing the clarinet but also a mixed mess of trombone solos, horn solos, bass solos, violin solos and unidentifiable solo instruments. If you want to hear just Pete playing the clarinet this not the cd. If anyone knows of a Pete Fountain cd that is just Pete Fountain playing the clarinet please leave a comment and tell me which cd that would be."
5,Great replica,Great little replica. Very detailed. Have all 5 of the replicas and they look awesome grouped together in my husband's music room..
4,A Great Read for a Stormy Afternoon!,"Two children must go back in time to help a ghost rectify a tragic mistake. If they decide to help the ghost, they put themselves in danger, but will be able to change the wheel of time and set it back to where it should be.This was a fun and enjoyable read that will appeal to anyone from tween to adult. The storyline is interesting and well written and the characters are likable.A great read for a stormy afternoon."
5,"Wonderful read, well-remembered","I read this book years ago, when I was in grade school, and it's stayed with me all this time. I can't wait to buy another copy -- I lost the one I had so long ago -- just to curl up and renew my acquaintance with these wonderful characters. I highly recommend this book for any young reader with an active imagination."
1,Not Her Best Work,"I have spent the last 10 months reading the Penelope Lively books and have found some delightful; others, good. This book is one that I started reading, then set aside because I simply could not get into it. I recently picked it up and began reading it again. It is quite boring and very disjointed. Time to throw in the towel and move on. I'm sure the next Lively novel on the list will reconnect me with the talented writer that she is. Just FYI, my favorite Lively novel so far is The Photograph."
1,A ripoff,"The version I received is not the version that was advertised. ""R"" is not the same as ""XXX"". Save your money."
4,"Delightful, innocent porn!","Such a delight! Playful people enjoying each other, doing what we all love, out for all to see. Such a beautiful girl Kristine is, Alice is such a lovely, prudish tease. Totally out there, totally camp, a playground we all wish we could join and be horny and goofy in. And, and ... oh how welcome in these razed times ... no razor burn!"
1,Not what promised. Beware.,"The picture shows the limited storybook edition which includes both R and X versions. What I actually received was just the R version. The cover received did not say ""limited storybook edition"". Amazon, you ripped me off!"
4,Old but still good,She has a cute look and the movie is kinda corny but there is plenty of flesh. My copy has both the R and XXX rated versions
5,This was Exactly what I was looking for!,"I saw this in the late 70's with some friends at a movie theater after drinking a bit and thought it would be funny to see Alice in Wonderland while drunk. Instead, it flashed across the screen that it was rated X??? We had a great time talking about that one!I thought about that movie from time to time over the years, and when I saw it on here, it was 1/2 the price of the same movie on E-bay! I purchased it, it came quickly and discreetly packaged, and was just as good as I remembered!!!"
5,Hilarious,"This movie is a great, it has a funny sexual twist from the original story. I was unsure when I purchased it. I am glad I did. If you like sexual humor, you will love this film."
1,Pre 1960,What a Rip off seen better tv R rated. If postage wasnt so high I'd pay you to take it back.
2,total eye candy....,"this book was not what i had anticipated.it might be great for tourists who want to see the true island living,or doll house makers, however,as an architecture student and a caribbean native i was not impressed by the literature, or lack thereof.excellent photography."
2,Dated and mostly Haiti,"Was hoping for a broader cross section of island styles, but most of what is shown here is from Haiti, much is Caribbean Colonial, and it just stops short of the richness that so many islands offer. The book was published in 1979, I think, so it's time to do an update! The Caribbean is redefining itself and has so many wonderful design ideas to use."
3,Caribbean Style,"I had the bood before but i lose it,and we want to have it again. Is an excellent book with beautiful photography."
4,"Culture, Community and Ethnic Identity","This book covers a brief history of Vietnam, Vietnamese people, of their heritage and culture. Discussed how the Vietnamese came to America more than thirty years ago as refugees and have created their own community that is now interwoven into the fabric of the American society. The author examines the Vietnamese community through their political participation, social issues such as education, community development, cultural preservation and economic survival."
3,"Ok art, not well labelled",We were looking for something with more detail on the deer anatomy. The artist was very good with his art but the text needed more details. Buy it for the art and you will be satisfied.
4,Great book. Some disappointments.,"Let's be honest. This was a great book. I mean just a plain great book besides its few dissapointmets. Look at it this way. You've read Sam Jones throughout the series and what happens? You find that she was not characterised well at all in this book. If she was, this would be a five star book."
5,Best burger template in town,I seen this on Americas test kitchen. works great at great price. Boughth one extra for gift.
1,Hamburger Press does NOT work -- Very Disappointed,"The Fox Run Round Hamburger Press is a JOKE!!! Very disappointed. It just does not work. It is impossible to get the burger out in one piece -- or two or three pieces. The meat sticks to all portions of the press and comes out in crumbles. I tried non-stick spray, cold water, leaving the press in the fridge for a time, warm water -- nothing works, It just is a waste of plastic. The only thing it did was releave me of some cash for the product and the postage!!! I am very disappointed. I contacted the vendor and got NO reply!!!"
1,What the heck?,I purchased this for making burgers. When it arrived I knew this would be troublesome. I ended up getting another burger press that worked like a champ.
3,It's ok,It does what it says but it's kind of a cheap plastic and the press down part should be larger IMO. I don't use it much since I bought another one.
2,Big Burgers - Too Thick and Round,"I bought this to help make my burgers appear more like what you would get at a restaurant, but it's not practical for my family. You still get hamburger meat everywhere and by the time you pack the meat inside this thing, you could have pattied your own hamburger. On top of that, you have to want extra large hamburger patties and use the bigger buns. My kids didn't like the big burgers and my husband didn't like them either. I would like it alright if it was smaller. Of coarse I will still have a mess, but at least I would get round patties."
5,"Best ""Hamburger Helper""","Why buy frozen pre-formed hamburgers of unknown quality when you can buy your favorite quality fresh ground hamburger meat, mix in your favorite seasonings, and use the Hamburger Press to form perfect hamburgers in a jiffy? Delight your family and guests with the flavor of an old fashioned homemade hamburger with a professional quality form that is just right for the hamburger bun. That's why I call the Fox Run Hamburger Press the best ""hamburger helper""!"
3,"Parts To Clean, Works Fine, Not Large Size","Works well. Four inch size. I searched for a large patty maker and this was the first result. No it is not large, they can cook down to 3.5 or so. I like using bakery rolls etc for buns and I avoid the commercial factory buns because they don't add as much flavor. (I did use Grands biscuits in a can and the size was perfect.)I even made burgers with half frozen meat and I really bore down on the press. Way stronger than it looks.Thin and light plastic that works fine. The only minor drawback is the three parts to clean, end cap, body, and press. Some minor digging in a few spots. Now without sounding like a total lazy bum some of the other models look easier to clean, and I am unhappy with the 4"" size, so the search continues. Ok deal, just small for me."
5,Nice Neat Patties & Easy to Clean,"I ordered this last summer have used it whenever I make patties. It is simple to use and best of all it is super-easy to clean. No weird little corners for meat to get hung up in. Makes a large patty if filled full, use the amount of meat you like and it will work. You don't have to fill the press completely full.I use wax paper between raw patties and freeze them. This is a really handy simple gadget for uniform patties.UPDATE 10/22/2011: I have used this weekly for 2 years now, and still love it. A good tool to add to your kitchen repertoire. So easy to clean!"
5,Perfect,"I use this product each and every time I make hamburgers. It makes a perfect size hamburger patty. I know plenty of people just use their hands, but I'm a fan of consistency."
2,area team rug,Not as thick and plush as we would have liked it. Very cheap looking. Wouldn't buy it again.
1,wrong size,"The shoes were cute but needed a size bigger. I called about exchanging them for the next size, which was no problem, but the price had increased from $27.79 to $51.00 and I was told that instead of an even exchange I would have to pay the new price for the bigger size. I would have liked to have known this before the purchase. So I returned the shoes and did not reorder. Plus I had to pay return shipping. From now on I will only order shoes from a site that has free return shipping."
3,"Disturbing, yet entertaining","*softcover edition*I found this work very enlightening and informative: about Pryors' early life and the extent of racism in places where it wasn't supposed to be. Pryor and co-writer really take you back in time to when it was three times more difficult for a Black man to succeed than a White man.Pryor describes himself as aperson never able to enjoy the fruits of his labor; never able to ""settle"". Before Eddie Murphy and many other ""raw"" comedian/actors, he set the tone with brutally frank and fascinating, off-kilter philsophizing.His drug abuse is detailed, though one wonders why an intelligent person would not try to block such a destructive personal and social impulse? Maybe there is a serious mental problem (which is not addressed herein)?The format is a tad confused: we have three voices going at the same time - Pryor, his co-writer, and his stage personae.Nice photo layout."
3,Adequete incite from a necessary comedian,"The book is immediately interesting and arresting. However, Mr. Pryor goes through lulls of semi-coherent, discractive writing. Pryor is very open with the reader in this book, describing everything he went through in fascinating candor. That alone makes this a must buy. Rich talks about selling out to mainstream Hollywood throughout his career. He did most pictures, regardless of the often atrocious scripts, admittedly, just for the money. There are also many fascinating stories about his habitual drug use and addiction(s). But this fact and the obligatory stories and excuses that follow allow the reader to realize he was a wild, carefree human being. Who was, admittedly, lucky to live as long as he did, considering the aforementioned drug abbuse.The book is 247 pages and 30-plus chapters which makes for a quick read. You won't be emphatically pleased that you purchased this book, but you won't be upset either."
2,knock-off cable,"This is a knock-off cable, which I was fine with at first, but after a month or so my computer no longer recognized my Zune when I'd plug it in. It's cheap so I suppose it did what it was expected to for a short period of time (hence two stars instead of one)."
5,Great,"Came out great, and it works fine. Thanks! I've been looking for this type of cable for the longest time."
5,It's Swell,"This item works just like it's supposed to. I bought it to replace the original one I had that broke. It fits my Zune HD, and I assume all other Zunes."
1,DOA,"As many others have mentioned, dispite the picture to the contrary this is an aftermarket cable, not an OEM Microsoft cable. Ours did absolutely nothing right out of the box. The computer did not detect the player at all. We tried a total of 3 ports (which work fine with other devices) on 2 different computers with no luck. Amazon can have their garbage back. This is a growing problem here in Amazon. They don't care if sellers bait and switch products as long as they get their cut of the money. Sadly, I guess it's time to go back to brick and mortar stores."
1,Zune Cable,I purchased a Zune Sync Cable from Cable Matters. This cable was inoperable from the first day of use. I simply plugged it in and waited for it to charge my Zune. The Zune was getting very hot within the first 30 minutes of use while plugged in as being charged. It never charged my Zune and after 2 hours. I had to unplug my Zune from the cable because it was extremely heated. The temperature went back to normal after it cooled and I have not used the product since. I purchased a similar cable from another supplier and had no problems. I will be returning this cable.
3,Not a Microsoft manufactured product...,"This cord works just fine, but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the description is misleading. The picture leads you to believe its just like the one that comes with the Zune with the Zune logo on the cord and that its made by Microsoft, but its not.Other then that it works just fine, and does what it should. Just wish the description wasn't so misleading."
1,worthless,"Cable does not work for charging. Do not buy, this is worthless. This cable isnot from Microsoft Zune. The picture on the Amazon site is not this cable, thepicture is a Zune cable but this cable is not from Microsoft."
5,Zune cable,for the price this was a great buy...works as advertised....delivered within two days..the original cable was junk...the Zune is my last microsoft product!
4,it works,the description is very accurate. it works quite well. its just a plug and play item which is very nice.
1,I should have listened to the other reviewers,"It looked great coming out of the box, but with the price I should have known it was too good to be true. My zune was about halfway charged and it usually only takes 30 mins with the original charger to charge all the way. I left it plugged in for 1 hour, came back and my battery was dead. It DID connect to my computer, but it DID NOT charge my device. So, yeah... I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!"
1,didn't work,"plugged in, and didn't work. tryed with different zune, still didn't work, different computer different usb port. didn't work, so dont buy this"
