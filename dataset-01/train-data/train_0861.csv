2,TOO BAD it doesn't last,"Eventhough I did follow the directions for cleaning, our machine like many other people noted died early. It actually only made it for 2 uses! I am so sad becasue it was such a cool toy. I plan to return it and hope the next one will be better."
5,Love the bubbles,"I have a two year old and a 7 month old and the love this product. They love all the tons of bubbles that shoot out and they run around and try to pop them! It can be messy with the bubbles - but worth the fun. Just keep out of reach because it is fragile and will break if dropped. I am on my third one since my two year old loves the way it spins! Enjoy! Also, get the one that does the huge bubbles too - I put them together and swear it keeps them laughing and jumping around for a long time! Love the big huge bubbler made by Gazzilion as well! Enjoy, Maureenps. the manufacturer even gave me a call to verify we were happy with their product - I was extremely impressed!! Will definately buy from Fat Brain Toys again!"
3,Finicky Bubble Machine,"My 2-1/2 year old grandson loves this machine, but this was my second purchase since spring. The first machine was left outside and wouldn't work after a rainstorm. The second one was left on my front porch overnight (I'm a slow learner) and wouldn't run after another rainstorm. I tried opening it and drying it out, but that didn't seem to work. I left it out there and one morning I went out and heard it running - just like that! So, we are now using it again and getting it inside at night. Although a lot of people say it doesn't work unless you use the Gazillion Bubbles bubble mixture, I've had no problems at all with the generic bubble mix that I buy at a national retail store. Even if this one breaks down again, I will buy another, because for $10.00 (or thereabouts) it's cheap entertainment for a little one."
1,Broke immediately.,"I got this for my children's birthday party. It worked for approximately 30 seconds, then the batteries started dying. Gave it a rest for a few minutes, and the same thing happened. Changes batteries, still the same problem. SO disappointed."
1,"Quality poor, works first day then never again","Thought I was alone, I had to manual feed bubble solution and unit is in such more quality, the solution leaks to the batteries. Duh, who designed and tested this. I have bought 5 since and same issue with each. Great the first time, never works again"
1,"Messy, uses many batteries and stopped working after three uses",The machine stopped working only after a few weeks. The little bottle falls over and the sticky liquid spills all over making the use of it very messy and sticky. Sometimes the machine would work and sometimes it wouldn't so each time i had to change 12 batteries or so just to see if it's the batteries or something else. i would not recommend this to anyone.
1,"Good Idea, Terrible quality",We bought it from another store for our sons 2nd bday and it worked fine the first time it was used. It was off and on for approx 3-4hrs that day. As per the instructions I cleaned it up and put it away but the next time I tried it the batteries were almost dead due to the soap having leaked into the battery compartment somehow. The soap dispenser is also useless and we added the liquid by hand as needed. Its going back for sure and I'll be looking for another brand bubble machine...
1,Fun while it worked,"We bought this last summer and it worked for 2 days and then it would not work no matter what we did.I did clean it after using it both times and I checked the batteries, but it just would not work. Like I said in the title my son loved it for the 2 days that it worked, but it just didn't work long enough. If you're looking for a good bubble machine that you'd like to use more than twice I'd look elsewhere."
1,Loved it but it broke after one use.,"I purchased a simillar one a couple of years ago, and lasted much longer than this one. This machine broke after we used it one time only. I do not recommend it!"
3,Great toy but doesn't last,"My two year old son loves bubbles so I bought this toy thinking it would give him lots of bubbles and hours of entertainment but unfortunately, after a few times of using it, it just stopped working. I replaced the batteries and despite that, it still wouldn't work. I didn't spill any liquid into the machine so its puzzling why it stopped. If you can get one that last, that would be super but in my experience with bubble machines, they don't last. Disappointed."
4,bubble machine,There is something about bubbles that makes it so fun for kids to play with. We purchased this bubble machines for our 3 and 2 year old kids. I have to say that is was a great bubble machine while it lasted. The manufacturers did not pay great attention in keeping the batteries well sealed from the solution the eventualy end up in the battery compartment.
3,Bubble fun,"I found this at my local Costco for $16. It takes a lot of solution to make it run, and you have to be careful not to let it tip at ALL or it runs out. It makes a lot of bubbles, the kids and cat love to chase them. We raised it off the ground in order to spread the bubbles. I'm a little concerned about the durability, its pretty flimsy. Now the issue is we are out of bubble solution..."
2,it was not very good,"I bought it for my little grandchildren and the third time using it began to lose strength, we changed the battery, cleaned it but still not working properly, I feel I wasted my money"
2,Didn't last very long,"Had high hopes of bubbles all summer long but it myseriously stopped working before the season ended. Could have been the kids breaking it, but I still expected more from a battery operated bubble blower. Took a lot of batteries to get a it going too."
5,It Really makes a Gazillion bubbles. Kids LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!,"This bubble machine is the best. We purchased a look alike that in no way compares to the durability of this machine. Kids love bubbles, mommy doesn't like blowing bubbles for them, so here ya go. I only wish they had this when I was young. Best purchase this year."
1,Wrong,"I would love to be able to review this title, but I did not receive it from either of the two vendors that claimed to have it. The first vendor just sent ""Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets"", an earlier release than the one shown on Amazon. The second vendor was nice enough to recognize that the CD they were about to send was not the ""Plane"" self titled Gary Jules that I had ordered. They kindly emailed me and apologized for the mix-up. So either the CD or Amazon has the incorrect bar code for this title. Would be nice if Amazon would double check that the products match the items listed for sale. I would still like to find this title someplace!"
4,Great looking lamp,I gave it a 4 star because of no plug and no switch.Everything else great.Would buy again and recommend.
3,Too Many Strength Moves for My Pain,"I would have given this 4 to 5 stars had it not been promoted as therapy for injuries. It would be excellent for someone building strength with few/no restrictions. With my condition, I need more stretches and fewer or shorter strength moves. In the flow sequence, nearly every move emphasizes strength, so I have to sit out most of the routine.I do like strength moves; I just have to dole them out very carefully or I get terrible pain from overdoing it. If you are looking for a routine that has a better balance, I recommend Yoga Zone's: http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Zone-Strong-Healthy-Back/dp/B00005K9PO/ref=sr_1_10?s=dvd&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1282551690&sr;=1-10"
2,Take a class first!,"I am a newbie to yoga, and I take classes at my gym. I just got a new job that conflicts with my favorite yoga class, so I bought this DVD so I could continue to reap the benefits at home. I was familiar with most of the poses, but there were a few poses that I had not tried before. I ended up getting a crick in my neck right after doing the dvd. My advice? Take a yoga class on the type of yoga in the dvd so you know what you're doing, and then use the dvd to practice between or without classes!"
4,Ox Star Review,Retold stories are a gift from this author. The story gives a great account of how oxen came to be animals of labor on Earth and is told with an easily understood lesson. I enjoyed sharing it with my students.
1,Squirrel Destroyed It,"I'm writing today, because I woke up to see a squirrel under a ripped open feeder, sitting in front of a pile of bird seed. This squirrel proof feeder is not strongly made, and IS NOT SQUIRREL PROOF!"
1,I had such high hopes!,"I had such high hopes that this would be just the right feeder for my ever increasing population of pesky squirrels. But because we had so many young ones, the squirrels just climb through the cage openings and feast away. They can empty this large feeder in a day! I have even tried spraying them with water to make this as unpleasant an experience as possible but then they get so frantic they trap themselves inside the cage and can't get out. Don't bother trying this one....it simply doesn't work!"
5,Caged Bird Feeder from Audubon,"I purchased this caged bird feeder for my husband for Christmas because he had been complaining about the large birds coming to our feeder and scaring away the small birds. We do not have a squirrel problem, so I can't evaluate it for that--but the tiny birds LOVE it, and there are usually several inside at any one time. We are also attracting birds that we have seen only rarely in the past. The only downside is that, even though the feeder holds quite a bit of seed, the birds manage to empty it in one day!"
1,Ming,"Great feeder until, as with Judith, a squirrel decided to put the bite on the exposed, top plastic parts of the seed tube. Totally destroyed. I'm now in the pleasant misery of trying to replace the tube. If you buy this otherwise great Goldfinch feeder, shape a 1/4 inch metal mesh cover over the vulnerable top and bend the end wires to keep it in place. Otherwise, this thing is too expensive to put out for tree rat marauders."
4,Not Chipmunk Proof but Good,This is a great feeder. It's not chipmunk proof but the squirrels aren't emptying it. The birds love it and we can once again enjoy watching the birds eat instead of just feeding the local squirrel population.
4,Great Feeder!,"I was having a problem with black birds chasing away the smaller birds from my feeders. This feeder allows the smaller birds to eat, and keeps the larger birds on the ground. I really like the easy of cleaning as it comes completely apart. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars as it does allow seed clumping in the bottom from rain. Otherwise I am very happy with it. I did note that it is sold as being 'Squirrel proof', but I wouldn't count on that as I've had numerous feeders that were 'squirrel proof', and the only way I've been able to keep squirrels away from my feeders is using a baffel. Therefore, I would recommend using a baffel with this feeder."
3,Compelling and Intriguing,"A Breath Away From Sleep caught my attention at the beginning and held it to the end, a feat which every author can't do. I enjoyed learning about Paris' past, and the cool and confident way in which she handled Tyree's advances was vastly entertaining. I was shocked when Tyree's mother entered the story, and couldn't wait to see why she was acting a fool. Ebony was another good character, but I was disappointed that Paris had to disappear from the story so that we could learn about Ebony. That took away from an otherwise excellent book.Nevertheless, I enjoyed A Breath Away From Sleep a great deal. This author has a bright future ahead of him, and I look forward to future works."
2,THIS BOOK HAS MORE FLUFF THAN FACTS,"I bought this book to help with my geneaology research of the Peabody family. Within ten minutes of thumbing through this book, I knew I had made a mistake in purchasing it. As a high school history teacher, I can verify that this book reads like an overly and poorly plagerized term paper. With regards to the Peabody family of the 1600s to 1800s, this book is short on facts and is full of historical background fluff. I was shocked that the author was so short on facts, considering that the Peabody's of the 1600s to 1800s, lead well documented lives. Considering that the fact that there is tons of data relating to the Peabody's on the web, not to speak of in the reference section of any good library, I am disappointed in the author's lack of research. Do yourself a favor, don't but this book..."
4,"Not Mann's best, but worth reading.","I've read most of Mann's books and stories, and I would say that this is probably the least subtle thing I've read by him (although I do like the ""message""). Some of the symbolism is even funny. But the characters are interesting and sympathetic, and it's nice to see him writing about women. I would recommend it to anyone running out of things to read by Thomas Mann."
5,He's the best!,I think If your an audlt or a kid I think you will like this toy!And look he has bare feet!
2,ROLLO MAY'S EARLY EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND ANXIETY,"Rollo MayThe Meaning of Anxiety(New York: Ronald Press, 1950)(New York: Norton, 1977, revised edition)This is a helpful book by an American psychotherapist.May was looking for causes of anxiety when he wrote this,but it still has some good insights into existential anxiety.Similar books will be found on the Internet:""Our Existential Predicament Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher."
3,"OK, but could be better","This game is adequate, but I expect much more, especially from an EA Sports title. Graphics are relatively good, but gameplay is lacking. The ability to accurately aim a shot/stroke is limited. Also, the ""backswing"" on the shot meter is started once the shot meter is displayed by depressing the ""A"" button--as a result, true control over short shots and puts is nearly impossible.""Final Round Golf 2002"" for GBA remains a better choice."
3,Meh.,"As far as golfing games go this isn't even near the best. It seems as though EA didn't even consider making it specifically for the GBA. The default overhead point of view could get on anyones nerves. Jack Nicholas Golf on the original GameBoy still beats this game as far playability, difficulty, and graphics that are easy on the eyes. If you're thinking of buying a decent golfing game, look somewhere else."
2,Buy New American Language instead,"I bought this album simply because I really liked Bern's more recent disc ""New American Language."" Unlike NAL, the lyrics on ""Fifty Eggs"" come across as forced and calculated, particularly the frequent four-letter words and overt sexual references. The songs are just a little too predictable, and at times cliched and contrived. (Not to discount what happened to Monica Seles, but comparing her to Jesus Christ is going a little overboard.) That being said, I would highly recommend New American Language. Songs like ""Tape"", ""Black Tornado"" and ""Sweetness"" are superb. Hopefully these are more representative of Bern's talent."
5,This is clearly Dan's best album.,"His past albums haven't had too many melodies, but every song on Fifty Eggs has a catchy melody. I love this album"
2,Didn't do it for me.,"My interest was piqued after hearing Dan Bern on NPR, but I was disappointed in the cd. I love acoustic guitar and original lyrics, even controversial lyrics. Dan Bern is somewhat controversial, but I felt that there was nothing to finally redeem his angst, to make listening to him worthwhile. There are a couple of well-done songs, but that's not enought to make me recommend this album."
2,Too Hip for his own good,"Unlike most of his self-titled CD, Fifty Eggs misses big time. What sounded witty earlier has simply gotten tired. Bern shows so much promise, but this CD is a step-back. Buy and enjoy his first one."
5,Excellent!,"This is a really great CD. Everyone in my family loves it, and ""Oh sister"" is one of my favorite songs. Many of Bern's songs on FIFTY EGGS very funny. This CD made our road trip from Philadelphia, PA to Albuquerque, NM much more enjoyable. I highly recommend it."
3,It's so-so,This is a very basic overvew of Chinese medicine. Nothing in here that you couldn't find on the Internet
5,Great overview!,"This book is great for those interested in Chinese medicine. It gives a great overview of the different aspects of Chinese medicine without over doing it. It is easy to read, has photos to illustrate ideas, and is not too dry. A great place to start exploring the world of Chinese medicine!"
1,Nice but not worth the money.,"Style is true to the 1960's. Ringer is too loud even in the ""soft"" setting. Buttons are not illuminated so its impossible to see how to dial in the dark. Overall, not worth the cost."
3,basic information for golden retriever owners,"This book begins with a brief outline of characteristics in general of a golden retriever. The largest body of the book consists of basic information regarding the care, nutrition, grooming, and common illnesses helpful for beginning dog owners. Several color photos of golden retrievers are included with the text as well as short chapters on breed standard and historical ancestry of the breed. The conclusion of the book generally outlines basic obedience exercises for all dogs. This book would be most helpful for potential dog owners who are looking into the purchase of a golden retriever. It would provide thumbnail insight as to breed characteristics and care involved prior to owning a golden retriever."
2,Sub par publishing.,"A sub par manual lacking technical, decent extraction information for purchasing patrons. The series in itself consists of manuals that do not reach the standards of Barron's or Rudenko's. The author does not have enough expertise typically required to publish this type of writing material. The paperback quality is standard, and may intrigue one to purchase the material for the bargain price shown. The information presented here is very unprofessional, and a waste of tree paper, as said previously by others. The author does not hesitate to document the information on the page, but should have made another attempt."
5,Great book,I have enjoyed reading this book. There is a lot of insight mixed in with Sharlene's personal experiences. It is full of ideas on how to better oneself and gain stronger self-esteem in any situtation. Glad I purchased it and recommend it to everyone. I also liked the fast response and shipping of this item from seller.
2,dolphin toddler swing,This swing is not baby friendly in that the baby can not comfortably lean back and swing. He prefers another swing he has that is more comfortable. He cries to get out of this swing after about 10 minutes. the other swing he will stay in all day if you would let him. We are seriously considering sending this swing back. No reflection on product durablity it just isn't as comfortable as it should be.
4,Good Swing but.......,This is a good swing except for one problem. When buckling the seat belt you had better be very careful because you can give your child a nasty pinch. We have found that this is only for small toddlers not suitable for large toddlers 15 months and older.
3,Durable!,"This swing was handed down to my son by his cousins who had used it when they were younger. My son loved it, but there is NO WAY that it can fit a 3 year old in it. My son used it till he was about 10 months, max 12 months. He is 28 months old and he could never fit in it now. The only thing I wasn't crazy about is that it can be a little awkward getting them in and out...other than that it's great."
5,My Girls fight over this one!,"We bought this for our two girls, ages 1 and 2 who absolutely love fish. They fight over who gets to swing in it first. Although I agree that it's for smaller toddlers or babies, my 2 year old, who is average-sized, still fits in it. Next year, we'll have to move her up to a big-girl swing, but the dolphin will still be going strong for the younger one. If I had to change anything about this, it would be to lenghten the ropes approx 6-9 inches. But overall, it's a wonderful swing."
4,"Good swing, bad rope","We have had this swing for nearly seven years, and the swing itself has held up in amazing shape. It has been used by my 2 children and my nephew, and will soon be handed back again for more use. The dolphin is terribly cute, very sturdy, and the thing swings quite smoothly. My one complaint has been about the yellow rope. After one year in the midwest weather (stored for the winter, mind you), the rope started to fray. Not in a way that would compromise the safety (it's not unraveling), but the rope developed all of these little sharp spines that made it feel like you were holding on to a thorny rose. Duct tape to the rescue! Yep, we taped it up, and now it is not very pretty but smooth for little hands to grasp and functional."
5,Misty of Chincoteague,Misty is a very cute model and will go great with other wild horses or ponys. Misty is so fun that it can turn a ponyhater to a ponylover. I really love the realistic paint patterns on her coat don't forget Misty's fith foal Stormy item 19 is for sale any where on the Internet.
5,This horse really rocks!!,This is a really pretty horse. I LOVE her!! She is verry durable too. Check out Misty's foal Phantasy Wings she is really pretty and durable too. ( And also check out Stormy she is really nice too! She is Mistys other foal. )
2,I Didn't Hum Them For A Day,"`Starbuck' sounds good when it starts, but bores before it's done, the same can be said for all the `best' tracks on this exploration of Brit Rock blandness. Boring, one note music that's really hard to like."
1,absolutely useless marketing exercise,"This is a pretty book: lots of gorgeous color photos of gorgeous Siamese fighting fish (""Bettas"") and glossy pages. That's its main, and only, selling point.Unfortunately, the info contained is mainly academic filler which is badly organized so that it's difficult to skim through and find the more practical bits, such as: 1. how often and how much to feed these fish, 2. how a Betta would do if mixed in with other fish in a large aquarium (answer: badly), 3. how often the water should be changed if a Betta is kept in a small filtration-less container of 1 gallon or less, 4. most common types of commerical food and which ones are better, etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.Thankfully, Petsmart has a liberal return policy...this one's going back pronto!"
2,Not for the average pet owner,"This book is definetly not for begginers. It has a lot of technical information that is virtually useless to to the begginer and average pet owner. I'm sure I would give it a 5 star rating if I were a breeder, but I'm not. Save your money and look for another book if you are a begginer to keeping Bettas."
2,"Doesn't live up to subtitle ""A Complete Pet Owner's Manual""","Despite the subtitle, this book is very technical and has little information which is of use for the average person with a pet betta. There is a lot of information on breeding and the different types of bettas, which might be useful for a breeder. As a pet ""owner"", I found it unhelpful. You can find more information about keeping bettas as pets for free online."
2,lots of info but not practical,"While this book is labled the ""complete pet owner's manual"" it does not deal with the practicalities of owning a betta. As a person who is a new owner looking for the basics, this book was too academic and had too much infomation. I did enjoy reading the history behind the betta fish and that was about it. This book is great for someone looking to breed and keep and sell bettas, but for us humble pet owners it does not give the needed basic information for daily care."
3,more than i wanted to know,too much info for 1st time Betta buyer. I was not planning one setting up a breeding tank. Just wanted to have one to watch.
1,No good!,"This book tells you nothing much about how to actually CARE for these fish, but goes on and on and on for pages about breeding the fish, which is not something a potential fish newbie should be concerning themselves with anyway. I agree with the other review that this book is mainly a marketing gimmick. I'm sure a lot of people who are buying a betta and never have had a fish before would be attracted to this book. Better information can be found online. This doesn't even cover the basics about using a water conditioner or having a heater in the tank. It doesn't address anything that a new betta owner would want to know. Stay clear of this book."
4,Pretty good,"I gave this book 4 outta 5 stars because this book was pretty good, it talks about alot of stuff the average person wants to know, but the only thing I dont like is that they talk alittle too much about the other breeds of betta that no one has probably ever heard of or seen in their life!"
5,Strung Out actually has talent,"Strung Out has been my favorite band for several years now. This is their first CD and it already shows their ability. If you have ever heard their second and third full-length CD you know what I'm talking about. This is a must buy, or record, or steal (although I don't condone that), or find, or. . ."
2,Only for old-school punk fans!,"This CD wasn't great, i'll be honest. All i seem to hear from punk fans these days is how bands like NOFX, Lagwagon, Strung Out etc... started out good, but have just got worse and worse. In my opinion, these people could not be more wrong. How can anyone not like the new Lagwagon and NOFX cd's is beyond me. If people would just stop and listen to the melodies in such CD's then they would realise that change is not a bad thing. This CD was far too metal and not enough melody. Strung Out, stick to what you're doing at the moment!"
4,Back when this stuff WASN'T a dime a dozen,"With the glut of awful skatecore bands plaguing the earth, it would be easy to pass off Strung Out as just another baggy-pants teenage fad. Well, this was their first effort for Fat Records, and their best. Back when they still had a slightly metal tinge to their sound that made them stand out. Nowadays, they're just another melodicore band in an overcrowded field of them, which is too bad. But many formerly decent bands have followed this path (Lagwagon) so it really isn't surprising. So if skatecore is your thing, any Strung Out album will do, but if you want to hear pre-""just another Fat band"" Strung Out then pick this one up."
3,You Know......,"i used to own this album, but i sold it. For a strung out album and a fat band. It's actually not that good. It's lacks a lot of power that they have gained in the 3 realeases after this one. If you are a first time strung out buyer....buy twisted by design!!!! it is wonderful."
1,Very Uninspired,"Despite the great Johnny Shines playing guitar on this album, and Sunnyland Slim's reputation as a great pianist, only ""Stepmother"" and ""Stella Mae"" stand out on this disc. There isn't much else to say about this album. There is a reason that it is very difficult to find. ""Thoroughly boring"" are the only words which come to mind. These guys must have been having an off day."
1,"Nice pics, poor info","I have a jungle carpet python, Morelia spilota cheynei. The book listed its sci. name as Python spilotus vareigatus cheynei. They have warped their true names, eliminating the Morelia classification. I have seen better info in the Barron's series, which I recommend. Here, the pics are great, but the info is poor. Do not buy."
4,"As apparent of 3 children, twins and a single....book is helpful","Do you feel as though you have no patience or that you cannot deal with your fresh mouthed, entitled kids? Does it seem as though you never remember treating your parents like the kids of today do? I thought my kids were ""bad"" until I started reading this book and trying to see it from their point of view. I'm not finished but even what I've read so far is helping me be a better parent.And, as for that, ""kids are worse than they were than I was growing up feeling"" this book provides and excellent explanation for that perception."
4,Respect for the little ones,"This book helped me see discipline in a whole new way. It's true, children don't have to suffer in order to learn they have done something wrong. We need to have respect for the little ones just as much as anyone else, and that's sometimes hard to remember when you are angry. ""Positive discipline"" explains this concept well. The only problem is if you have very young kids, this book doesn't help much in terms of specific examples. Most of the examples are about children 5 and up. I would imagine ""Positive Discipline for Preschoolers"" would serve my situation better. I am buying that next and will write a review for it shortly......"
2,Not for little guys,"Very disappointed in this book, right on the back cover it says ages 3 + up and I found hardly any mention of younger kids at all (except to say in some cases that you will need to do things differently with younger ones...different how? Thanks for the advice *eye rolling*). It seems geared towards school age children."
3,This book is not bad.,"This book had a lot of good suggestions, but I think it underestimates the sheer stubbornness a child can exhibit. If you are firmly against spanking, this book is for you, and good luck with that, because I don't feel that these techniques would work with some of the little monsters that are out there these days. Don't get me wrong; I think spanking should be a last resort, and not used excessively, but I was spanked as a kid and I turned out just fine. The ""positive"" time out concept has worked for me to a point, but that's not really discipline; it's more a distraction. I get better results by making my daughter sit in the corner, facing the wall, and taking her toys or privileges away. It's worth borrowing from the library, but save your money. There are better parenting books out there."
5,Best Money Spent,"If you ever second guess how you are raising your child, you need to read this book. This is the best book I have ever read. My relationship with my son has really grown into something I can be proud of. Children deserve a chance to be raised happy.Excellent decision."
3,Useful but did not live up to the hype,"This book provides useful tools for your toolbox. Don't expect miracles or a fix-all, like the book implies. Certain scenarios are not realistic. It also requires children to want to participate in a ""positive"" manner, which is not always the case. Overall, it's a useful read that shows how to attempt to engage your child in a way to gain their cooperation. But remember, we can't control the way our kids think or act. Sometimes they just don't want to."
3,Not my cup of tea,I read the book. I agreed with some. I disagreed with others. It isn't a bad book; it just wasn't what I was looking for.
5,great parenting and teaching CD,Jane Nelsen's work is excellent for understanding children and their behavioral needs. I recommend it highly.
5,Very Influencial Book For Me--My Favorite Parenting Book,"I first read this book before I had kids when I was a new teacher. I've read it several times over the last 10 years when I've needed to rededicate myself to being an understanding, compassionate parent.My goal has always been to be a respectful parent--not yell, speak calmly, and listen to the child. And this book has helped me achieve that when I had little understanding about how it could be done when I started.I love Jane Nelsen's theroy of mistaken goals that explains kid's misbehavior and use this frequently when kids misbehave. I continue to have family meetings each week with my family because it brings us such rewards. My kids really feel heard in the meetings and we solve many problems, get more cooperation and more family fun as a benefit. I read this book 10 years ago and I still refer back to it and use what I learned from it."
1,Not reality,"Dr. Nelson, though I'm sure is very intelligent does not write a sound book for children of today, especially those children in disadvanteged households. She stresses real-life punishment, and that is fine IN THEORY but in the praticallity of real life it is not a useful book. Buy Canter's Assertive Discipline instead, a much better read."
1,a joke,"This book may be fine and dandy in theory, but it doesn't work. Want to raise a brat? Buy this book. Want to raise a kid who grows up to be an adult who can manage on thier own? Buy this book. Enough said. This book was required reading for a class I took at the University level recently, and after reading parts of it in the bookstore, I ended up not even buying it."
2,Best read BEFORE you have kids,"I loved this book---before I had kids!! I do believe it was helpful in some ways, because I agree with her philosophy. However, in practice, these methods are spotty at best. Also, it was only after having kids, that I realized how hostile this author is to parents. Every misbehavior of kids is blamed on the parents' lack of understanding. Any parent who is reading this book is obviously trying to be as good a parent as they can and to have this author continuously bash parents as being controlling, etc. is extremely demoralizing. Check this book out of the library, it has some good points--but DONT buy it."
2,More storytelling...less skirting,"My expectations for this book was high as the title held such promise , my therapy practice brings me into a deep engagment with the issue of perfectionism.This book tended to brush up against the issues and not really engage withthe deeper dynamics .Too much of the material was hovering and just out of reach. In other words only partly digested.The examples from the individuals lives did not really take the story apart .....so much potential but not taking us into the heart .Most importantly a deep loss of story ,so this felt remote and unfulfilling."
2,Loopy cubed,"Jung is loopy. Jungian psychology is loopy. Jungian psychologists are loopy. It surprises me that people take this stuff as seriously as they do. Maybe there's a good Jungian explanation for that too. That said, Jung was, in my opinion, the Wagner of early psychology, and, like Wagnerian opera, there's a lot to be learned by mulling over some of the ideas presented therein. But remember, Jung was more of a Romantic philosopher than a psychologist. Colorful stuff. Just don't take it too seriously."
2,Um&#65533;,"Hey, I'm an archetype anyway you slice it. Prodigal, jester, shaman, wanderer-it's all in there. I have made millions of dollars from ideas that come to me in dreams. Jung would laugh at this book. Believe me. Look inside yourself. And laugh."
3,Pretty good comeback,"Being a damned fan and hearing all their album, this being the last one I got, I kinda came to the conclusion that this was what Music For Pleasure would of sounded like if done, mostly, the right way. True, there are some clunkers on this one but the Damned sound as close to punk as they have in years. Not the thing I would buy first but a pretty good one if you are a fan. ""Shadow To Fall"", ""Testify"" and ""Never Could Believe"" are better than anything off of the MCA albums. Don't know why this one got all the bad press it got?"
3,"Experimental,shape shifting vibes","O.K.,been a damned fan since the very beginning,and I agree, get the earlier stuff to get acquainted,ie;their first lp,Black Album,Strawberries and some live stuff(FinalDamnation).This record is good,but I dont listen to it everyday....Lets see what the Vanians bring us this year!"
2,unnecessary,"Unimportant, useless release by a band that that should have known when to quit...Not bad, just not good. Totally lacking in anything that made the Damned the Damned. Can you tell I was disappointed?"
1,What the?,"The basic problem with this album is not the music, but the fact that it doesn't sound like the damned. The damned have been through countless line changes over the years but even so the energy and the spirit of the band has carried on into each new lineup, how ever on this album it doesn't.There is very little energy, the tracks tend to sound the same and everyone is doing their own thing, even Dave Vanian on vocals doesn't save this one, he sings like he's a million miles away and rather disinterested in the whole project.My advice buy anything else by the damned and you won't be disappointed but don't buy this!"
2,Not Really the Damned,"This album is not really a Damned album. Yes, it features many of the original members of the Damned, but the music bears little to no resemblance to the band's classic sound. The only songs that resemble their older material are the energetic ""My Desire"" and the melancholy ""No More Tears."" Other than these two numbers, the rest of the album sounds like, to quote Patricia Morrison, a ""bar band."" The musical style of Not of This Earth is quite similar to Eric Clapton's later material, a pseudo-blues rock band with slick production. It is by no means the most horrible thing in the world to listen to, but it genuinely lacks the creativity that Vanian, Scabies, and the rest of the crew are capable of. Where are the psychedellic influences? the experimentation? the raw energy? the darkness? the sense of humor? These elements will not be found on Not of This Earth, an album strictly for completists."
2,The Damned - 'Not Of This Earth' (Cleopatra),"'Not Of This Earth' is The Damned in name only. I didn't even realize until later that vocalist Dave Vanian wasn't on this CD. Two original members were, guitarist Brian James and drummer Rat Scabies.As for the tunes that I thought were so-so included ""I Need A Life"" (the theme song to WAY too many of us anymore), ""Tail Spin"" and maybe ""Shadow To Fall"". I haven't found one other fan that even remotely likes this release. I think it's fair. I saw the Damned out on tour like a year after 'Not Of This Earth' came out, however, the group's two OTHER original members were there, Vanian and bassist Captain Sensible. After the gig, I met up with the Captain and he told me that THIS disc should be avoided at all costs."
3,"Good sound, not enough experience and deversity though","Being a musician myslef, the song shimmer intrigued me the first time i heard it. One of the reasons it is so catchy of a tune is that the chord progressions have trouble resolving themsleves and the song has an overwhealming drive to the end and once the song is over, you just want to listen to it again cause it doesn't feel likt it really ended. A creative sound and other catchy songs with the same style make this album attractive. Seeing them perform live in chicago was quite an experience, they are a fun band with great potential if you are into the heavy metal pop feel like creed and some other new bands. Still they need to learn how to play in differnt keys and create more diverse music."
5,"Great, Great, Great","This is the best cd I ever bought. I never thought that music could be this powerful. I love the lyrics and the overall impact of the songs. They leave you singing long after the cd has finished. Great job guys, and I can't wait for the next one. Also, if you get a chance, go see them in concert. They are so energetic and sound even better in person, if that's possible."
5,This has got to be one of the best CD's out there.......,"Fuel is one of the best New Rock bands out there on the market. I non-stop listen to this piece of art. I seen them at the X-Fest in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and they were one of the best bands there. I hope that there are going to be more bands out there like them in the future."
3,"""All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade.""","Not very many mainstream bands can hold my attention for very long, and they've finally kind of lost me. But the few months that I had Fuel's ""Sunburn"" spinning in my CD player were great. I had downloaded an MP3 of ""Shimmer"" and thought it was an excellently crafted song. While the rest of the album pales in comparison, it's all better mainstream rock than you'll find elsewhere. When listening you can tell that the band cares about their music, but like many artists, Fuel can't seem to shake their musical habits."
4,A Solid Debut,"""Sunburn"", America's introduction to the PA-based rock band Fuel, is almost everything a debut disc should be. Laced with crunchy guitars and lead singer Brett Scallions' emotion-ridden vocals, the songs pack a powerful punch equal to any hard rock group around. Yet what sets Fuel apart are the melodious, catchy songs. Though dark, the tunes actually have a tune and quite good ones (""Shimmer"", ""Sunburn"", ""Mary Pretends"", and ""Hideaway"" are my personal picks). Carl Bell is an impressive songwriter and guitarist; my only disappointment is the fact that the album starts to lag in the middle before picking up again towards the end.For an even better batch of songs, check out Fuel's new album ""Something Like Human"". But ""Sunburn"" is worth buying, too. The power and talent of these four guys are on fine display. You'll want more immediately."
4,Come feel this!,"I'm not really into heavy rock -I'm more of a pop boy- but these guys won me over with their energy and great songs. Sunburn and Shimmer (the 2 hits I was interested in) are fantastic and stand up there with Push (M20) and Iris (GGDolls) -2 reasons already why you should get up off your a** and buy this CD! The rest of the album is full of blistering, loud, heavy rock songs, with a mess of guitars and lead singer Brett Scallions' seductive, powerhouse vocals, and for some peculiar reason I can't get enough! Superior stuff."
5,I SIMPLY THOUGHT THE ALBUM ROCKED!,I thought this was a great album and can't wait for more stuff from Fuel. The album kind of suprised me when i bought it because i bought it just for Shimmer. Then i listened to the rest of the album and found out the entire album was good. I especially liked Sun Burn and Song For You.
5,One kick A** Cd,"This CD kicks cause of songs like shimmer sunburn and Ozone. I listen to it while I sleep and when I need to vent. I recomend it to anyone with the money, it's one of the best, and always over looked."
5,Fuel is wonderful!,"This CD is great! A band out of Pennsylvania, going along quietly and singing songs with meaning. Jesus or a Gun reminds us who our real savior is, and we need not turn to suicide. Bittersweet is my favorite, combining a catchy rhythm and reminding us that this world is something we can't control. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes Creed or Collective Soul."
4,"Good album, but which direction are they heading?","I'm not trying to sound pessimistic about the band, but I don't believe they can be considered as a great band just yet. They've had a couple of hits that I like: ""Bittersweet"" and ""Shimmer."" Unfortunately, with the trend of most bands in the 90's, it's one, two, or three songs and then they're out of the picture for good. If they can continue to make great hits in the future, then I'll change my opinion.I really enjoy the song ""Song For You"" (Track #8), which is about letting go of someone you love. The melody has its own way of saying ""Where do I go from here?"" If I had the power to decide what was released to the radio, I would have released this song in place of ""Jesus or a Gun,"" which didn't buy much into me emotionally.Overall, the album's a decent blending of music and emotion. However, I'd give Fuel a couple more albums before judging if their tank is full or running on fumes for the long haul."
3,Good enough,"Besides ""Shimmer"" and Bittersweet"" (which everyone seems to like, including me...) the other tracks, though well done from a technical standpoint (vocals and instrumentation), are ultimately forgettable so far as the song writing and lyrics go. Still, ""Sunburn"" is decent overall, and may well be ideal for those top 40 and pop fans who delude themselves into thinking that their musical taste is eclectic by pretending that the light, alternative sound of Fuel can actually be considered ""hard rock""."
2,One Good Song,"I bought this Fuel album for the song ""Shimmer"". That's the only good song on the album. A couple of others are okay. I should have just bought the MP3 of that song. I paid $3, only for shipping, so I don't feel too bad about the deal. Otherwise it's a 1-star."
3,"ok, but nothing special","All right, but it wasn't too high quality. Fine, Shimmer, Sunburn, Bittersweet, and Its Come to This were good, but the rest were mediocre at best. They're better than the one hit wonders, but I don't like that they snagged the original Fuel's name, even if they sucked."
5,Buy Fuel! Alternative Rock Never Sounded This Good!,"I listened to Fuel a while ago, without realizing it. I heard ""Shimmer"" once, and was desperate to find the artist. When I found out it was Fuel, I bought their CD and fell in love with ""Bittersweet"" too. Their lyrics are moving and powerful, and evoke real emotion. Plus Brett Scallions is a hottie. Even if you're not a heavy metal fan,like me, buy ""Sunburn"" just for songs like ""Shimmer"" and ""Sunburn"". It'll definitely be worth it."
5,Fuel is totally and amazingly awesome,"Fuel is AMAZING. Brett Scallions' voice is just amazing. His voice combined with Carl Bell's guitar, Jeff Abercrombie's bass and Kevin Miller on the drums makes Sunburn a wonderful combination of hard sounds like ""Bittersweet"" and softer songs such as ""Hideaway"" which I noticed many people failed to recognize. Although my favorites on the album are ""Ozone"" and ""Shimmer"" I love all tracks. So everyone out there that doesn't already have Sunburn, go out and get it. And if you have yet to see Fuel live, go for it man, because it is truly an amazing show."
4,FUEL IS BITTERSWEET.,"I was very impressed with this album. I would like to give it 5 stars, but most of the songs sound the same and tracks six and seven kinda suck. Personal favorites: Bittersweet, Shimmer,Jesus or a Gun, Sunburn and Ozone."
3,above average matchbox 20 meets soundgarden,the two singles are awesome but the rest of the album is not up to that standard. the album rocks but there is nothing especially memorable with the exception of maybe 4 songs. i do recommend it but not highly. bittersweet and shimmer are so good though that it was worth it to me. the other songs are good but not as catchy as matchbox 20.
5,Fuel really rocks!!!!!!,"This CD is one you have to buy. Some of my favorite songs on it are ""Hideaway"", ""Shimmer"", and ""Bittersweet"". Every song is great and they need to be recognized more than they have been. Fuel is an awesome band!!"
5,Beautiful Rock Music,"there is a lot of great rock music out there, but only a few bands produce what I call really beautiful music, such that evokes a wonderful feeling inside of you when you hear it. Bands representative of this that come to mind are Collective Soul, Live, and Radiohead (at least in The Bends and OK Computer). there are three amazing songs on this cd: sunburn bittersweet, and shimmer, and these carry the cd. Many of the other songs are also good and diverse in nature. A must for any alternative rock collection."
5,Studio Bank of 1997,"Recorded at Long View Farms, North Brookfield, Massachusetts Diring 1997. Fuel's sound is an interesting amalgam of '90s rock styles. Within the space of one song (as on ""Untitled"") they move from the clamor of thrashing, hardcore guitar riffs to melodic, accessible chorus to lyrical, sweeping instrumental passage. Their outlook is far from a sunny one, as evinced by the aforementioned cut, as well as such tunes as ""It's Come To This"" and the title track. For all their Big Rock angst and sonic terrorism, though, they never lose sight of the pop verities; a catchy chorus and a more-or-less hummable melody. SUNBURN should fare well among those who like a little edge to their alt-rock and those who like their headbanging leavened by a pinch of sugar."
4,good enough,"*this is an easy review that you MUST follow*to say the album easy: the first 5 songs and the last song of the album are true true rock and roll over looked master peices, seriously. You should get the album for just those 6 songs. Shimmer is the most perfect ballad rock song i've ever heard (next to dont wanna miss a thing by Aerosmith). the rest of the album is preety crappy but wroth a listen if you like the new metal alternative stuff (Korn, staind , orgy , etc.. dont get me wrong i like a few of these bands).of all in all this is a great buy with great songs. get it (even i like it)."
5,"Much more than ""Shimmer""","Fuel is my personal favorite band, and I have not heard a Fuelsong that I don't like. This cd, the band's first major title, isfilled with a great range of songs, each an individual masterpiece.While many may buy this cd having heard only ""Shimmer,"" theywill be surprised by the rest of the album. Personally, I like""Sunburn"" better than ""Shimmer"" anyways, but forthose that still believe that ""Shimmer"" is the best, the cdhas great complements such as ""Untitled,""""Bittersweet,"" ""Jesus or a Gun,"" ""Song forYou,"" and ""Mary Pretends."" The other songs are stillgood (or great), but they don't hit me the way these 7 do. Finally,in comparison to ..., this cd is not as good; however, the highpoints of this cd are better than those of ...."
4,"Very good album, just not great.","This album is very good, especialy tracks 2,3,5. I just think it could have been a lot better. I just feel like the last three songs were stuck on this album so that they could release it on time. I think that they could have done a better job."
2,There is one good song on it.,"The first time I heard the song Shimmer I was hooked, so I bought the CD because I heard the rest of it was good. I was very dissapointed. I can't believe so many people liked the rest of the songs on this CD. The only good one is Shimmer, so get the single, but listen to the CD before you buy it, PLEASE."
2,Yawn,"Fuel may give a good polished performance on this album, but there is not much else to it. The lyrics seem to be written by some drunk slurring inane drivel and the music, although catcy at first gets old very quickly. The band has taken a tried and proven formula and produced a mediocre album, nothing else. They're not charting unknown waters here, and this album is unlikely to be one that influences anyone else in music, as everything on this album has been done before. Even the name is copied!"
3,"Pretty simple entertainment, not too bad.","Some films I will let play in the background while working on my laptop. This one may not be for everyone, but it wasn't too bad. I would imagine most kids would enjoy not just getting out of cleaning a garage, but wishing for a television personality to show up in their room too. Some movies I watch are for the entertainment value and not to critique, or analyze. This one was entertaining enough to warrant the time I spent watching. Great for a few laughs, and cleaner language than most these days. I think it is worth at least three stars for the laughs, and for dialogue that didn't consist of four letter words."
1,Invisible Dad,"This movie was so incredibly bad that it was funny! Save yourself and your family from this lemon. It was poorly written, acted, edited, you name it. It has no redeeming value whatsoever. Sorry folks, but giving it one star was not a real accurate statement, more like -5! Our ten year old couldn't even bare to watch it, it was so lame!"
5,organizer,This sorter is perfect size for my desk space by giving me more room on the desktop and putting all my files handy.
3,me gusta un poquito,"I love the settings, the storyline premises, the environment and the carachters. I just wish that the AI wasn't as aggressive. You mostly end up in multiple cross-fire or your vehicule gets slammed from every possible direction. A little slow paste strategy would have helped the game. Anyhow it is 80 and sunny during the action, and the humidity level is very high...Rico should take it slow."
2,THE LONG WAITING IN VAIN,"I'm going to put this sweet and short, this game sucks!!!!. a just wait a complete month to play this game following the reviews of game magazines, and the screenshot that the web page of EIDOS show us, and finally i had the chance to play this in my own xbox console and just worst 30 minutes of gameplay and never seen before from now. first all the characters are weak and thin, the firepower of the gun sound bland, the physics of all the vehicles are unrealistic, this men can walk across the edge of a mountain and never fall, like the amazing spiderman or the amazing glue man. the missions are boring and foolish, etc, etc, etc. I play Scarface and spyhunter nowhere to run and this game are far beyond better that this steamy guano pile(steamy beause this early launching)."
1,Short Life and they are NOISY!,"I bought these bulbs in the desire to ""do the right thing."" The advertised savings in electricity costs over the lifetime of the bulb would be a bonus. BUT, the bulbs burn out with minimal use! That makes them environmentally disastrous when you realize their toxicity and the energy costs for their remanufacture. (There is a Federal Government website which details the precautions that one has to take if the bulb breaks to minimize the toxicity effects.) But what really irks is that they are noisy, with a quite noticeable and annoying static sound even at the lowest wattage of the 12, 23, 29 watt bulbs. I am returning these bulbs. One expects a lot more from GE."
1,SHORT LIVED BULBS,I ordered three of these bulbs to save on energy and because they were touted as being long lasting. Two of the bulbs failed within the first month. I hope a different brand of these bulbs will be better because I won't order these again.
1,Why use carmine color?,"Darn these taste good, but do they *really* have to make them with insects? Should be avoided by vegans, vegetarians, persons with religious diets that restrict insect consumption, and people with insect allergies."
5,A classic,"This is definately one of Pino's finer moments. His songs are well crafted and the way the guitars are wondering off in any direction without losing track is pure magic. This album will surely make you want to sit down on a quiet night with a glass of good Italian wine and listen to it al the way through.If you understand anything about the Italian language you'll probably laugh about ""Che Sodisfazzione"" which is a great synical song. If you're Italian is below par you'll still be thrilled by Pino's voice and accent: they do stand out as well. Just try this album: you won't be disappointed"
2,Not as good as I expected,"This book is not very well written, the author spends a lot of pages to explain things that we don't need to know like: ""Replace the text 'Welcome to our site...(20 lines)' by '...' (another 20 lines)""The author don't go in depth in the subject, you just fly over some methods but after the reading of the book you won't be able to do a lot more than before with ASP, PHP or Coldfusion.If you love to learn programming languages, don't buy this !You can trust me !"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"The more I got into the web site design that I bought this book to help with, the more useless this book became. If you want to build a toy web site, this book *may* help. If you want to build a professional looking web site, this book is useless."
3,Read with caution,"I purchased this book in hopes to learn more about dynamic web pages. For the most part, this book is well written and contains many useful illustrations. Chapters are logically broken-down into digestible sections, where one gathers both a valuable hand-on experience and a basic understanding of ASP, ColdFusion, and PHP.I understand no new book is published without errors; and this one is no exception. My only problem is, when I contacted the author (Jeffery) though Allectomedia to point out a few new errors, he never responded. According to the online form you fill-out they state, ""We usually respond within a couple days"". I waited a month, and didn't receive any response nor notice these new errors added to their errata page. I then filled the online form out again, and another month later, nothing. Perhaps they don't want their errata page to get too large, as it may deter others from purchasing this book.Now I know which books and authors to avoid."
2,SAkers,"Nice book for beginners. However, not a book for programmers. What little code view you can see is constantly cut off so you cannot see the complete code. A lot of guess work is involved. Also, the code that is spelled out within the text does not stand out so it tends to blend into the text a little too easily. On a positive note, this book does give you a good overview of the basics of dynamic web programming."
5,CONSISTENTLY GOOD ALBUM RIGHT THROUGH,"For me the better tracks on this album are ""Do your thing"",""Learn to love"" and ""Just a memory"" but all the tracks on this album are good.I read on a web page that had information about Mariah Carey and her Crave label (the label that signed 7 mile for this album) that was scrapped not long ago that 7 Mile's album had ""moderate success"" in America but ""failed to break into the overseas market"".I thought this was a bit of a laugh because artists like 7 Mile aren't even promoted outside of America. This group has excellent vocal abilities and I could quite easily see them being a success with acapella songs. I look forward to any future releases by 7 Mile"
1,disappointing,"I have several CDs by this same artist, so that I felt confident buying any of his CDs. Big mistake!! Where the music of his that I already have is excellent big band jazz, the music on this CD is awful. It is screechy, extremely dissonant, and seemed to be disorganized so that no tune could be discerned anywhere on any track. I sent this CD back."
2,Needs Changes,"Great concept, but bad design. Both of my children have had one for a year. Due to the discomfort, they never use it! It needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around."
5,"Great product, good price","Great product, good price, we bought these several years ago, and we still use them today, and they are still like new. I probably use them more than anyone, and I am 6'1"", about 230lbs, they are very sturdy, but comfortable too."
4,Sturdy video rocker,If you are looking for a nice heavy duty video chair this is the one. It will tolerate little boys rolling around on it and it will allow itself to be dragged from room to room without falling apart.It is made in the USA and to me that means quality.
5,Great chair,"My boys got this for christmas (ages 9, 11) both were very exited and haven't sat anywhere else sinceI decided on this one because we have younger children who can destroy anything and this chair seems sturdy enough to hold upSo far the boys are loving the chair, it folds easily and is easy for them to carry from room to roomit does take up more room than I thought it would but that is the only draw back I have noticedThe boys did mention how hard it is but they solved that by putting a pillow behind their head and that was the last I heard of itI personal have tried the chair and found it to be very comfortable but I haven't spent hours in it like they have"
3,rock n'fold chair,"The chair was purchased for an elementary school library. The kids love it, but it is not as comfortable as a padded one we also have in the library, and the folding, while useful for storage, does collapse on the kids while they are sitting on it. Overall, since it will probably last forever, I'd rate it pretty good."
3,slippery chair.,"I loved working with the seller. David Depolo is great at resolvingissues!I should have read the description more carefully though.It slides all over my wood floors. It's hard plastic. Very uncomfortable!My child rarely uses it for gaming or watching T.V.I have to remind him he has it. He usually takes a pass on that.There were others out there same price, that would have been more comfortable for him..and not slid all over the floor.I would use this seller again, but read more about what I am getting."
5,Great product for many uses...including homework!,"Back in January of 2006, I purchased the ""Rock-N-Fold"" Chair for my son. He absolutely loves it! Not only does he play his video games in it, he also does his homework in it as well! This product is the best ever!"
4,He Could Have Used a Copy of Blackmailing for Dummies,"This book is really a 3 but I gave it a 4 because I had so much fun with it in a nonlinear way. A blackmailer (no surprise, revealed early on) has a houseparty and in the great British spirit of hospitality invites a houseful of people he is either currently blackmailing or plans to blackmail during the weekend.Schedule:8 am Breakfast kippers9 am Blackmail10 am walk in garden11 am Blackmail12 pm Tennis and blackmail1 pm Lunch watercress sandwiches2 pm spot of blackmail3 pm blackmailing for extra credit4 pm tea with crumpets and blackmailAnyway, guess who gets stabbed during a rousing game of charades?And guess who did it?

4,Certain People: America's Black Elite,Received in a timely manner and in good condition. A great book for dealing with internal and external racism.
1,"All form, no substance","While evaluating espresso makers online and reading reviews, I cam to the conclusion that Capresso 112 was the best value for my needs. I liked the look of the machine - very classic, almost bahaus design.When I disinterred it from its box, I was excited by the look but wary of the machine's weight. This initial feel, I believe, should have been the tell-tale sign: it is cheap. For the first week, it made great coffee and the steam attachment worked marvelous. By week two, however, the coffee was no longer warm and the milk was being sucked up the straw and not steamed or frothed, but merely recycyled into a different vessel out the other end, still cold.I called the Capresso customer service number and also got luke warm assistance. A thoroughly disappointing experience! Ultimately, if you want a disposable coffee maker the Capresso Pro is excellent. If you would like one that lasts longer than a week, I would recommend trying a different brand."
1,Works Great...For First Few Weeks,"Then we had to return it back to manufacturer for repair. The problem that we ran into was the espresso began to drip coffee instead of rapidly pouring it. Yes, we did follow the instructions on cleaning the unit. Yes, we did try pods vs ground espresso. The pods seemed to work great (depending on the Starbucks blend). For the price, I wouldn't buy it again. We are returning this unit back for repair (maybe three times a charm!!!)."
4,Use a burr grinder,"Once I used a burr grinder (setting 4 seemed to work well), it made wonderful espresso! They should emphasize this more strongly in their instructions--using a regular grinder with this machine clogs up the seive."
1,Save your money,Uless your a REAL fan of Van Cleef this is a very poor done movie. Color is bad and looks like it was a transfer from a old VSH tape.I'm a western fan and like Van Cleef but this a waste of your time.
1,Horrible Quality,"This toy is the cheesiest toy I've ever bought. First off, Cyborg does not bend. Secondly, the car fell apart after a weeks use. Do not buy this toy, it is a waste of money and time."
5,"Its a great radio, but theres no FM on this one!","I think somebody made a boo-boo. The T6310 sports the FM radio, not the T6320. Within the last year I have owned every Motorola FRS radio out there, and I have had the T6310 for six months (at the time I wrote this) and wear it everywhere I go. I bought it for use at work and just cant seem to leave home without it (sound familiar). The radio has been dropped, smacked around and just plain abused, but it still works great. Some people dont care for the swivel clip, but I think it was a great idea. If you ever sat down with anything hooked to you belt and felt that auwful jam in your side, you will appreciate the swivel clip. But anyway, any of the T6300's are great. Just remember if you want listen to some jams while your yacking away, the T6310 is what your gonna need..........:)"
4,Atomic Music,"You've heard of the series ""Atomic Betty"" on the Cartoon Network before, now hear the new ""Atomic Betty"" soundtrack !This features the opening theme, which sprung up a really cool music video on one of the DVDs, as well as a few other songs as heard on the TV show and some others not from the show. They're all sung by Tajja Isen, the voice of Atomic Betty herself ! Now that's truly amazing.If you like the ""Atomic Betty"" show and like the really cool music from that show, you know you want this soundtrack."
4,Good book!,"Got picked to write speeches for my boss, bought this book to help. Actually a very good resource, I also belong to Toastmasters and this book helps out with some great tips and techniques. Only down side is that the Kindle version (which I bought) contains images and text blocks that are wider than the screen. They are a bit of a challenge to view. Content is great though."
4,Nice.,"Condition, as specified. Non-fiction book. Used for Texas History study for middle school student home school. Interesting account, good photographs."
1,sizes run small,I wanted a down stadium parka with a fur trimmed hood like the one I have now which is an extra large. When I tried this parka on I could barely close it over my chest. There is no way I could have ever worn a bulky sweater under this coat. The sleeves were short also.
1,Not what it seems,This coat is not as fashionable as it looks online. I sent it back and found a Michael Kors for half the price.
4,"No Squirrels, Not Perfect","This feeder is great for foiling squirrels.The little stinkers climb down onto the ""hat"" part of the feeder. They can't reach the food ports, they can't hold on, and eventually they slide off onto the ground and look very displeased.The feeder's one drawback is that the hat doesn't want to stay squarely on the hopper.No matter what I do, wind tips the top over to one side. The birds don't notice, but I do. It also doesn't make it any easier for the squirrels.To be honest, I'd buy another one; they work."
4,Stanley,Incredible behind the scenes on the Special edition. I saw this movie when I was a kid & it brought back memories.
1,"senslesss violence towards animals for the ""sake of film"", whatever that really means","I'm not really sure what just happened.I had no understanding of this film beforehand( reviews, criticisms, etc.) But...if you like to see animals beaten to death for the ""sake of realism"" then by all means seek this P.O.S. out. Ive seen everything available here by Rugggero Deodato and this film is by far a contender for most despicable film ever made. Senseless animal cruelty awaits you. Enjoy?Snake lovers beware"
5,Thank God for Retro!,"I was so grateful to find this telephone from yesteryear. I like the look of a rotary dialer, when it is in fact separate buttons. I wanted it in black, but it wasn't available. Other things I like, are the ability to pick the phone up and move it closer, the heavy, secure feel of the receiver, and the old fashioned ringer, which beats these high pitched, irritating modern telephone ringers. I can also turn the ringer off when I don't want to be disturbed. I give this product 5 stars!"
3,Not weighted properly,"I like old things and old looking things, so I bought these phones. I just opened one up the other day, and removed the heavy lead? weights that were inside the base and the handset. The phone is very lightweight now, but it works better for me. I wanted the handset to have that old-fashioned shape so I could rest it on my shoulder. Before I removed the weight, it would slide down or feel heavy in my hand...not balanced. I guess that when these phones were made back in the day, there was more research put into comfort and ease of use. It is also a little weird to use the round keypad, but there is no other way to change that, as it is mimicking the old dial phones, and that is the look. I am glad that I opened and am using the one, but I may just donate the others to a charity for a silent auction."
3,Too analytical and verbose,"This book is a good read for coaches, especially youth coaches for players under 13 or so, but if you are looking for a catalogue of drills that will improve first touches then look elsewhere. The technical discussion and text in this book (of which there is plenty and well done too) is an excellent primer for coaches on what to look for and emphasize when coaching touches, but again, unless you are a novice coach you will not find a lot of exceptional drills here. As an aside the DVD version of this book is awful, amateurish and too short. I found the book to be a better buy than the DVD."
4,The known facts point to Moses as human father of Jesus,"My parents made me go the Sunday School just about every Sunday, but even with some background in the Bible, I had to read ""The House Of The Messiah"", twice to begin to grasp Osman's theory and his presentation of facts. What drove me to persevere was his intriging hypothesis that Jesus was a Pharoh of Egypt. That might sound farfetched, but he does presents a plausable explaination. One of his complaints was that limited access to the Dead Sea Scrolls robbed him and other scholars of the ability to check their theories against whatever might be found in the Scrolls. From what I gather that situation has changed since he wrote this book. I am very curious to see if he's found more support for his theory or if he has had to radically change it. It's helps to be an Egyptologist and Biblical Scholar to read Osman's book, but it's worth discovering how his radical theory might very well have merit."
3,Frothed,"This unit work well enough, but is very hard to regulate so you don't get all froth instead of hot milk. It is anything but automatic. It also runs out of steam quickly. If you are using a large cup or mug, it runs out of steam about 3/4 of the way through the process. It does however builds steam back up quickly.I wish I had read more up on this uint before buying it."
4,My frother just broke after a year of use...,"My sister loves this unit - unfortunately just after the year warranty was up the machine broke (water container is leaking down through the machine). Produces good froth, but if you are looking for the same consistency froth as comes out of an expresso machine, the Capresso probably isn't the unit for you."
1,Not impressed,"Upon receiving this machine, it frothed approximately 2 and a half coffee-latte type drinks before some major problems occured. First, the water tray used to provide steam leaked to the point where water needed to be replaced each time a new beverage was to be made, and then the machine stopped frothing milk completely. I would not recommend this product at all."
5,Excellent frothing machine,"This is the best frothing (milk & steam) machine at an exceptionally low price. It took me 10 minutes to figure it out and its been producing superb cappucinos, lattes etc. It really works and in an unbelievable 90 seconds is ready to produce 170 degree steam and hot milk. All you have to understand is turning the rubber regulator knob slightly to the right to produce hot steam or you will get warm, not hot froth. Also, you must clean 3 small parts in the machine each time under running water ( it literally takes one minute) or used milk will clog it up. I have used $1,000 machines which produce worse steam (of course they give you expresso which this one does not do.)All-in-all an exceptional machine. I loved it!"
2,More of a Hot Milk Machine Than a Frother,"After initially giving this machine a rave review (and 5 stars), I've downgraded my opinion after using it for a little while. Though it has a couple of nice features (the large reservoir and the hose attachment that lets you draw milk straight out of a milk carton), the amount of froth it produces just isn't enough for me. The milk comes out nice and steamy, but alas, the froth is just barely there. I've gone back to the ""manual"" frother I had hoped this machine would replace."
1,do not buy it...!,"i had great expectations on this one and i am not happy at all. it will give you a lot of steam and no useful froth at all, just hot milk,noise and trouble. i just tried again the attachment that came with my la pavoni europiccola and it works much better. i am sorry that i lost 69 dollars on this machine."
1,Beware if You're Dairy Free: Doesn't Work with Soy Milk,"If you're dairy free, be aware that this unit does not work with soy milk. It creates only a little froth that dissipates quickly. I called the company, which acknowledged this fact. Too bad it isn't made clear in the purchasing materials. We would have never purchased it."
5,"Finally, something simply works!","Right out of the box and with skim milk, I have a latte that rivals the corner coffee bar. Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to clean. Can I ask for more? What else is there?"
2,Not enough froth,"It heats the milk fine, but I was after froth for an easy latte. Alas, the froth is minimal. The machine's been confined to under the cabinet, and it's back to the espresso machine..."
4,Great Frother-just make sure knob is tight,"The frother worked GREAT the first day but, after cleaning it, I could not get it to froth the milk. The following day, after cleaning again, it started frothing again- The key: the little Knob MUST be pressed firmly into the connecting tube. Once I did this, it Frothed perfectly. I would highly recommend. Very easy to clean and re-assemble:takes 2 minutes."
3,Works wonderfully!! ... When it works ....,"I like thick, foamy milk for my drink. This machine works wonderfully .... I get much better foam than what the baristas typically would give me at Starbucks. However, you have to jimmy and jiggle the FrothXpress in order to get it to work.We put an extra gasket (plastic washer) in the spout ourselves, and now the machine works every time. The foam quality has deteriorated slightly, though I'm still happy with it.I put in a call to Capresso Support yesterday to ask if we're missing a part, and to get a replacement. No one has called me back yet, and it's been 24 hours. That's kind of annoying.So, I give 3 *'s. Even though the foam/froth quality is excellent, the intermittent functioning of the machine and slow response time from Support to deal with issues knocks off a couple of stars for me."
3,"Works great, as long as it lasts","After maybe 18 months of everyday use the seal in the water reservoir failed. Water leaked onto the parts below and they corroded. I took the unit apart, cleaned the contacts and used it another year. Now it's having trouble again and I'm tired of messing with it, but I'm buying a replacement because it's still the best product I can find. It would be even better without the planned obsolescence -- improve the seal, and, as back up, make those internal parts out of something that water can't damage."
2,Not what I expected,"Overall we found this product to be quite unsatisfactory as we could never get it to produce frothed milk. The directions that came with the product are poorly written and the parts just don't seem to fit together very well. The unit did heat rapidly and it does produce steam, but again, we could never get frothed milk. So, we thoroughly cleaned all the attachment parts and ran steam through the system to clean it out (as per the directions) and we also double and triple checked the assembly of the parts to make certain that it was all put together properly, but still no frothed milk; just warm steamed milk. If we made any adjustments to the flow knob then we would just get steam. All in all, it was very frustrating and did not deliver the frothed milk."
3,Just OK,"I still use the automatic frother when I am running a little late on a weekday morning, but not on weekends when I have time to do it right. It produces steamed milk and froth more conveniently than the steam attachment on my espresso machine, but the milk is rarely hot enough and there is not enough foam for me. Cleanup is very convenient. As the machine continues to produce steamed milk for several seconds after it is turned off it takes a bit of practice to avoid overfilling the cup when steaming directly into the cup. I use ut, but I would not miss it and would not replace it if I did not have it."
3,Finicky but useful,"I asked for and received this machine for Christmas 2004. It is okay but not perfect. The assembly directions could have used a concordance. Once together, it seemed at first to only want to work for my husband who has no use for its product. Now I can get it going. It cleans up nicely and I've done soymilk as well as skim with good results. My biggest regret is that I can only fit a regular coffee cup beneath it; more often, I'd like to add the milk directly to a large mug of tea or coffee, or I'd like a large mug of hot milk period. I have to collect the steamed milk in something that fits beneath the nozzle then pour into the large mug, with some loss of froth action.As for the leaking one of the other reviewers mentions: it's all a matter of how you snap the water reservoir in place. It's a little fussy."
5,milk frother,I wanted to be able to make lattes for our hot tea and since we don't drink coffee I didn't want to buy an espresso machine. The Capresso FrothXpress answered my needs. It is easy to use and creates nice hot milk and froth. I use 1% milk. The only con is that you have to learn to shut off the steam before you get to the bottom of the milk or you will have milk spatters. I marked the plastic milk holder with a permanent marker for the volume I like to have so I don't have to guess each time I fill it. Neat machine!
1,Terrible quality,"I've tried this 5 times now. 2 leaked water when you filled the reservoir. 3 times the button to produce steam froze. I am sending this back and will try one last time because it works well when it works.Someone needs to come up with a comparable product as there is a need. However, Capresso needs to get this product redesigned."
5,Latte Lovers Rejoice!,"I have nothing but praise for this machine (FrothXpress) and for Capresso (its manufacturer). It worked great from day one and any questions I had were answered right away by Capresso's customer service (even if they had to call me back). The FrothXpress is easy to use and makes lattes like a dream! You do need to read the instructions before attempting to use it for the first time, but after that it should be clear sailing. Enjoy..."
1,The worst product I have ever run accross,"Capresso 201.01 FrothXpress Automatic Milk Frother, BlackI just got this thing today and was quite disappointed with it. The thing would not siphon milk out of the container and it just poured hot steamed water. I called the support but I doubt the replacing the tube that attaches to the milk container will not make any difference. I wonder if the person who agreed to put a prototype to be put into production had his head in the sand failing to see a poor design this product is."
3,Frother,I wasn't that thrilled with the frother... or maybe it just wasn't what I imagined... I did not like the taste of the coffee with the froth on top so I returned the item.
5,Abandon Expectations,"I expected the worst from this one. As a life long business consultant and golfer, I usually find such books to be written to the least common denominator idiots who play golf or seek to justify playing golf at the expense of their business careers. This one was a pleasant surprise. The golf etiquette advice is simple and sensible and the related business advice is even better. In fact, this book offers a good distillate of the best business consulting, leaving golf out of the picture. But the use of golf as a premise for this advice really does make for fun and recollection of the lessons. I suspect that Mr. Smith is a very good golfer and he is certainly a business consultant to whom I would listen. The writing still is clean, quick, fun and literate. The only book of this kind worth reading!"
5,A great investment. Required business reading.,"Author Mike Smith is articulate and delivers a highly organized, common sense look at how to comport oneself while on the links w/ a client. All 18 chapters give you the chance to score your ""game"" versus what may be your competition! A fun, quick read choc full of great advice. Go for it!"
1,Failed Attempt-Stick to Star Trek,"I had high hopes for this book, but they quickly evaporated.The author introduces a device (one that has been triedbefore, actually) of following the cosmic history of anatom to discuss many aspects of science. But withina few chapters the approach gets stale and feels totallyforced and awkward. This is partly due to the author'sincessant and clumsy attempts to be chatty, and partlydue to his just not being able to communicate the science inan interesting and informative manner. I really did love hisStar Trek books--somehow in that totally pop-science arenahis style worked. But here, with real science, it fails.(And, as an aside, his using semen as an example of bodilyfluids that we all inhale was, really, beyond tasteless. Ido like writing that pushes the envelope, but this isjust silly,forced, and embarrassing.)"
1,Don't Order This Ring...You Will Be Disappointed!,I ordered the Titanium Celtic Beast ring as a gift and was truly disappointed when it arrived. Don't be fooled by the appearance of the ring's size...the picture is greatly magnified. The ring is very narrow...only 7mm in width...not a good width for a mans ring. The Celtic Beast design is SO SMALL that you really do need a microscope to see any detail. I sent this ring back for a refund...would not recommend!!!
4,Tribal Ring,"Although the ring first came in the wrong size, the company responded quickly to correct the error and I received the correct ring and free shipping to return the first one. The ring itself is quite nice and my son is very happy with it."
5,Great ring for dragon lovers,"I bought this for my husband's birthday and he loved it. Unfortunately, I was unsure of the size and the 15 was a little too big. He should have had a 14 and maybe even a 13. The ring was lost one cold day when he was raking leaves. We think the ring went into a trash bag, never to be seen agin.That is my fault though so I say to please get sized to ensure proper fit. Obvious advice but still good.I loved the dragon silhouette. It's nice looking in it's simplicity and you can still tell what it is. I say a great buy for dragon lovers at a great price."
4,DH likes it...,"He wanted something to replace his lost wedding ring and since he's always having to take his off for his job, this was the best idea. Price can't be beat, easily to replace when he loses it (yet again) and he likes the design. Sizing seems a bit off, ordered a 13 (his size) but it fits a little larger."
4,celtic beast,"I can't really rate this except from the day my son got it. Fit well and looked nice, especially for the price. My son went back to Iraq, for the 8th time, the day after I gave it to him, he liked it a lot when I gave it to him."
3,It is ok,it is ok not great but cool. it gets scratched fairly easy. like from rocks. oh and it says titanium on the inside.
5,Great pinky ring,"If you like heavy jewelry that makes a statement, this is the ring to buy or any ring at this site. It was a gift for that special someone and they loved it."
2,"Cheap, feels like plastic","I bought this product thinking it would be good. First of all the size wasn't even right. I already had a size 9 ring and this one looked like a 6 or a 7. Second of all, it feels like plastic because its extremely light. Its made of titanium but it's very light."
5,if you love the spy games,"I started in the middle of this trilogy and immediately bought the first one and got the third one from my aunt. If love this type of action, then you must read these books. There is drama, international intrigue and just enough romance to not spoil the action. Actually, the woman is just as cold as anyone in these books. I think the British have the best fictional spies of all..."
5,Highly Recommended: An Original Contribution to Hindu/Christian scholarship,It is always a matter of celebration when Francis Clooney writes a new book. I have a number of his books and have consistently found in them a rich intellectual and spiritual feast. Divine Mother Blessed Mother closely analyzes three texts devoted to three Hindu goddesses and compares them with three Christian texts devoted to Mary. Clooney's close reading brings out the best from each text and makes for fascinating reading. My strong recomendation comes from my position both as a scholar of Hinduism as well as a Hindu nun of 30 years standing. Clooney's treatment of Hindu texts is deeply respectful and enlivened by his profound knowledge of the Hindu traditions. I highly recommend this book for Hindus and Christians who will learn about their own traditions as well as readers who are newly acquainted with each tradition.Pravrajika Vrajaprana
1,Gender rights or Theology?,"It is extraordinary that a Theology Professor should be talking politics. The book's dedication proclaims: ""to women everywhere who have been silenced, ignored, denied their rightful place and voice..."" How benign! I recommend that Clooney teach geopolitics in Harvard Divinity School instead of wasting time on Mary and those 'goddesses' with two d's. It looks as though the learned professor is trying to define a new discipline called Comparative Theology without understanding either comparison or theology. It is a pity that trash gets dished out as scholarship from Harvard. Woe unto Harvard which has fallen to such depths."
2,Not so good,"I love the Rizzoli and Isles series, and I've read some of Gerritsen's other works, so I was really surprised to see how lame and flimsily written this story was. It was intended to be as much a romance novel as a mystery, but that can be done well in the hands of a good writer (look at J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts). This book read like a college student's first attempt in a novel writing class. The only saving grace is that the characters are just a little more than one dimensional (maybe 1.5 dimensional). The premise of the mystery started out promising, but after an embarassing body count the mystery just became pedestrian. And a predictable formulaic ending."
4,I like it,I'm still reading the book but I like it. I enjoy her books especially Rizzoli & Isles characters. I look forward to reading more of her books
3,Not up to Gerritsen's newer books,"The plot of this story is rather predictable, but a good read none the less. It's more of a quick read with none of Gerritsen's heart-pounding story lines. I would recommend this book, but don't read it expecting Rizzoli and Isles-type action."
4,Entertaining,"Though this was written early in Gerritsen's career, her skill at weaving a good story is already evident. Not up to her magical story-telling skills of today but certainly an entertaining read."
4,Keeper of the Bride,"couldn,t put it down at first after awhile it wasn,t what i thought but the ending slow down instead of climaxing"
2,Not a Good Read,"Well I usually enjoy Tess Gerritsen however I found this story banal. The characters were flat , it was difficult to find the hero or his love believable. The villain's motives questionable. I did find the location interesting . Since the story was not suspenseful it was easy to put the book aside."
4,keeper of the bride,"suspense, romance. Kept my interest in the book. I thought it would be more thriller but I enjoyed the book."
4,Keeps you reading.....,Very good book. Couldn't put it down. I think Tess Gerritsen is a great author and have read a few others of hers.
1,ROMANCE NOVEL,"I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO READ A EXCITING WHO DONE IT, TOO MUCH ROMANCE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMENED THIS BOOK"
3,book,t with it it was a little sappy for mehis is not a great tess gerristed thriller i read it when i could not sleep i was bored
5,Keeper of the Bride,I really enjoyed this book. The suspense kept my interest. I could nearly put it down. I would highly recommend this book.
4,Keeper of the Bride (Her Protector),"I loved this book by Tess Gerritsen. It was a thrilling book to read, I could not put it down. It was everything I expected from Tess when I read the book. What a fascinating book and story to tell everyone.Beverly"
4,Keeper of the Bride,Good read. I have other books by this author that I have not read as of yet. Looking forward to it.
4,Good book!,"I enjoyed this book. Read part of it on the plane recently, and it kept my interest. Gerritsen is a very good writer. Enjoy buying this."
1,Keeper of the bride,"Awful. Colossal waste of$6. Heroine whining every other page ""BOO HOO HOO. He doesn't love me!"" because the cop is doing his job. Waste of time and money. Brain cells killed themselvesWould mark NO stars if it let me"
3,Quick Reading,I generally enjoy Tess Gerritsen books but this is nothing like what I had previously read. This is a Harlequin Romance type book and would probably be enjoyable for anyone into that genre.
4,Page turner,A can't wait to finish book! Moves fast and kept me up at night to finish it. Love all of Tess Gerritsen.
5,Wow!!!,Excellent suspense with a love story intertwined.... My favorite author has done it again! Tess Gerritsen is wonderful!!! Great book!
2,not one of her best,This was not one of the author's best. Very predictable. I found myself skimming most of the last half. Just did not get why the bad guy was after the main character. Was a little lame.
1,Predictable and repetitive,Curious how Tess Gerrisen could write this bland piece. Very repetitive the thoughts of the characters and you could guess the end from the very start. The only things you coud not guess were the stupid decisions the bride and the detective took all the time just to fill up pages. Very desapointing.
3,"A romance novel, through and through.",I don't usually like this type of book........too much inane drama and breathholding for me. This was a little better than most but still doesn't make me want to read another.Will continue to read this author's other offerings....Edited......stupid auto-correct!
3,Keeper of the Brike,"The book was okay, but I prefer her Rixzzoli and Isles books. It was a little too predictable. I like more mystery."
4,Good story,I enjoy Tess Gerritsen and her writing style. This book held my interest and did not disappoint me. If you are looking for a new author give it a try. Good mystery.
4,Fast moving.,"I liked this book. It held my interest, was filled with suspense and had like able characters. I would recommend it."
5,Typically Tess,"Another awesome book from one of my favorite authors. She's never a disappointment - ever. If you are expecting love, suspense, and a very good read, try Tess."
2,Not the best Tess Gerritsen,I usually love Tess Gerritsen but this book was corny. Her Rizzoli and Isles Books are awesome. I'll stick to them in the future.
1,Soap Opera,Normally like her books but did NOT enjoy this one. Too predictable and totally average. Very much a Harlequin type book.
2,Very Deceptive,This is an old book. It's not as good as any of her more recent stories. I think I read this years ago. I am very disappointed that they are showing a current publication date and don't mention that this was an old publication.
3,False Pretenses,"I really like Tess Gerritsen, however, I kind of felt like I was duped with this book. I thought it was her latest and it was just an old story repackaged. It was a B- compared to some of her later books. Her writing has improved since this one was written."
3,Ok,This is an ok story. It took me over a week to read it. When the storyline is great I have a hard time putting the book down. Not one of Ms Gerritson's best.
1,Yuck,This is definitely not her best. It was horribly predictable. I would not recommend this to anyone. It was difficult to just finish it.
1,Not a new book,"I read this book and kept thinking, I have read this. I love Tess Gerritsen, so I did some research. This is not a newly published book, even on Kindle. Check it out before you buy is all I am saying."
4,"love story, chaos","Not to bad a read. Little bit of fun,a lot of violence, equal parts of romance. Family dysfunction, and of course a good cop. Tess Gerritsen books are always a good read."
3,The Keeper of the Bride - a disappointing early novel from Tess Gerritsen,"I was disappointed to find out this was a re-tread, published early in Tess Gerritsen's career. It was too much a Harlequin Romance type novel for me. I much prefer her murder mystery type books. It was an okay read but I can't remember any of it now, it was quite unremarkable."
3,A reasonable read,"Some of this was a bit silly. The characters were limited. The relationship with her family seemed a bit silly. Do people REALLY object to their children getting an education and job? C'mon.However, I read the entire book and while not a thrill a minute page turner it was OK. I've read others by Gerritsen that I liked much much better."
5,Keeper of the Bride,I always enjoy a good read and Tess Gerrotsen never fails to come through. I can hardly wait for her next book to come out.
2,Keeper of the Bride,Started out great but devolved into a love story - not a real mystery. Probably should be listed under Romance.
5,"The excellent ""forgotten"" Damned album","I don't know about anyone else but ""The Black Album"" is probably my favorite from the Damned. It's sandwiched between two other great and possibly better known albums - ""Machine Gun Etiquette"" and ""Strawberries"". But I think the songs on this album flow better and I keep coming back to listen to songs like ""Wait For the Blackout"", ""Twisted Nerve"", ""Hit or Miss"" and ""History of the World"". The dark goth-like tracks ""13th Floor Vendetta"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""Curtain Call"" are some of my favorite Damned tunes. This album is a perfect blend of the old, hard and fast Damned and the later psychedelic pop Damned. Get it, you won't regret it!"
5,The Best Song Ever Is Here,"I just want to say that ""The History of the World, Pt. 1"" is the best song in...the history of the world! Never remembered what album it was on, so I've been collecting different versions on anthologies. Here it is! Relax and enjoy! I loved it circa 1980 and have rediscoverd it in the 21st Century!"
4,Possibly the Damned's most bizzare early album.,"Turning their backs, mostly, on their thashier early days and moving forward is sudden death to most bands. Could the Damned pull it off? For the most part, they actually do, especially on the 'slower' songs(""13th Floor Vendetta"", ""Dr. Jeckel & Mr. Hide"", ""Silly Kids Games(w/Sensible vocal)"",""History of The World(Part I)"", & ""Curtain Call"") which bring, except for ""Silly Kids Games"" of course, Dave Vanain's voice more up front and show how much of a good singer he is. Saddly the faster songs are where the album is most at fault with a couple of possible exceptions(""Wait For The Blackout"" & ""Lively Arts"" both work beautifully and ""Therapy"" has an excellent middle but goes on for far too long). The two Damned classics on it are ""Wait For The Blackout"" and ""Curtain Call"". Any album where the singer shouts:""I'm gonna be a lazy slob"" has to be good. Not too bad of an experiment but totally subdued, no sedated, considering the fire of their earlier albums."
5,Tops MGE,"A truly great album where the band veered away from making a pure ""punk"" album and did whatever they wanted. Tough to find one single highlight, as all band members contribute, esp. the most underrated guitarist ever (Captain Sensible)."
4,Worth the price,"Damned fans, curious listeners, and anyone seeking good music will like this one. A step away from their edgy punk material to more refined works. Curtain call may take you a few listenings to fully appreciate, but it is a deeply powerful song."
5,Good reference material,"I bought all four of the small Essene gospel books as part of my general reference of Biblical history. I found them to very very interesting. The books are small, but the material is interesting."
5,Find Out Who He Really Is,"If the Word of God can be likened to food (and it can) for me, Confirming Our Faith In The Lord Jesus Christ is almost like chocolate cake; it is a pure pleasure to read!This book is filled with valuable information about who Jesus is, what His origins are, what His ministry is, and how He fulfills this ministry. Secrets of God's creative power are revealed, as well as an in-depth look at the subject of prophecy and its operations, and an explanation of the Virgin Birth.This book is very detailed and will challenge mature Christians, yet it is also accessible and useful to young Christians as well.Highly recommended to all believers."
5,Keeps Dad Busy!,"My dad LOVES playing Tiger Woods Golf. He had the 06 version and let someone borrow it. Unfortunately it was returned all scratched and would no longer play. In 2008, I bought him the 2008 version and he absolutely loves it! He still plays it all the time on his laptop and has had no issues with the graphics. He's not very computer savvy, but he had no issues loading this all by himself. The game runs great and does not bog down or run slow. I think it might be time to get this for him for Wii as I've read other reviews that had good things to say about it."
1,Worst Tiger Woods Game Ever,I should have heeded the warnings of other reviews.The graphics on this game stink and the time it takes to go from the score card to the next hole is unbearable.!!!!!!!!
1,Not Good For Vista,Have had software problems from day 1 on Vista operating system. Game will abnormally shut downor abend without any notice. I went to microsoft site to find applicable updates that might stop it but nothing is working.At this stage the game is mostly worthless and not worth the trouble it takes to try to finish a round.
2,Still not better than LINKS 2003,"Why when hitting a ball over a sand trap, the ball suddently dives into the sand trap,instead of landing on the green!!!"
4,08 Makes the grade,"To be honest, Tiger Woods 08 is a lot like the other ones in this best selling franchise, but there are some differences worth noting. First off, the tiger challenge mode has been greatly expanded with all aspects of a golfing game included.Also, there are confidence drills sprinkled in to help you gain an edge down the road. These confidence drills are saved and analyzed to identify your strengths and weaknesses to improve your game.23 golfers and 14 courses make this game a treat, as well as the game face feature which allows you to make a pretty freaky replica of yourself to play on the course.Add in the ESPN ticker with updates and breaking news and you have a game that is fun and challenging at the same time. A must buy for golf fans as well as sports fans alike."
1,Great for masochists,"This game is easy for a non-gamer like myself to 'get into'; the options and PC controls are reasonably straightforward. As I progressed in 'golfing' efficiency I realized that the game is not geared to reward good shots and penalize bad ones, but to some agenda of its creators. Doing everything 'right' can bring disastrous results, depending on this agenda. Life provides enough hard knocks without volunteering for them. Only a masochist will stomach this punishment for more than 30 hours or so. So... the question becomes: how much is 30 hours of moderately interesting entertainment worth? Your call."
5,Great golf game,"I play this game just about everyday, Its nice to be able to play some golf during those cold winter months when you can't get out."
3,good price for Tiger Woods game,my husband said it was hard to use but he is not great on the computer.
1,Not working.,"The Tiger Woods 08 installs on my xp, but will not allow games to display on screen, or play. Contacted EA Sports and got no response."
1,Rip Off,Dated and then some. Hangs up on my new puter even with 8GB of ram. Should have more ways to play against computer opponents. Microsoft should bring back Links. I still run it on my old puter and have ten times as much fun with it. AND it NEVER hangs up!
3,Disappointed,"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08I tried out the free demo and really liked it, so I bought it new online for $14.95. I installed it without any problems, but when I tried to play it I got an error message telling me that I didn't have the right kind of DVD player on my computer. There are no specs in the Amazon.com ad for this and none on the box, so there's no way you can check to make sure you have the right configuration before you buy. The cost of return shipping combined with the hassle of packing and mailing it, aren't worth the purchase price, so I'm trying to give it away, and I'm even having trouble with that."
2,:-(,"Well, TW 08 is a major turn off for 2 main reasons among others: yes, it has a new attractive honeycomb interface, but the benefits stop there for the most part, and furthermore (which brings me back to the 2 reasons), the gameface has been reduced to a minimum, with little chance of creating a character that you can truly identify with, and the golf courses consistently, annoyingly, disgustingly, mix decent animated graphics with the crappiest first generation backgrounds that near compel me to flush the whole blolddy game down the toilet.It is high time that EA sports came out of its complacent stupor and put out a product that is on par with the best graphics-intensive games of our time. The potential is there, waiting to be realized. Until then, I will sadly turn my back on TW."
1,Can't use a gamepad.,Who would want to play this game without a gamepad? Not me! Waste of money; ended up leaving it under my bed for the past 2 years.
4,Play everyday.,"The last of the PC versions to play before the franchise went all bonkers online only I think. Regardless of the lousy company EA, this was a great game franchise that many still play daily. Thanks to GameRanger and Tunngle(sp) we can continue to enjoy games like this that the producers abandon. Greed of the gaming companies will be their undoing as you see many well known names shutting their doors. My friends and I play TW08 almost everyday so jump in and play if you like golf."
1,Waste of Money,This DVD would not install. The download for this game is idenitcal. This game is not connected to an EA server.After calling EA to get a connection to a server it still would not install
4,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08,"I love the game, very well done. graphics excellent, sense of real play is there, but the game can be a little slow in reaction time. The game did not give ram specifications of what is needed. I have 3G Ram and it bogs down a bit. Used to have 2005 and it didn't do that."
4,Tiger Wood Golf,"actully I haven't had a chance to play the game but I am sure it will be what I expect. I am going to school and had to studyy for all my finals, I am hping that I will have some time soon to play the game."
1,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 Ripoff,"It is disgraceful that EA Sports would keep a game on the market that can't recognize it's own disk & the same goes for the people like you that continue to sell the game.In loading the game I had 3 Blue screen crashes. I was lucky it didn't harm my computer. After finally getting the game loaded the program would not recognize the disk. I then searched the internet for a fix, I realized that everyone is having a problem with this game.I should have known something was wrong with the 08 version because it is selling for a 1/4th the cost of the older versions."
2,Not much diffrent than previous versions,"I like others ran out hoping that this would be a lot diffrent from 07, but it turns out its not much different. My advice is save your money,stick with 07 (& if your lucky enough 06 which was perfect) 7 if you have to get this, wait til next year when you can probably get this for under 20 bucks. My computer is pretty strong & it was crashing all afternoon while tried to play an entire game. Very dissapointing. It will keep me from buying 09 next year. Oh & the Photo game face is not in the game itself like they were touting for months, its an online addition & so far it's been inundated with people this week, so they are having problems with it. Save your money."
4,duffer,"The game was easy to load from the disk.The game is challenging and brings you up through several levels of play.Worth the money and I do recommend it. Note of caution, it's not very fast paced."
2,Let me play,"I love the Tiger Woods series,this is my third. I bought a new pc with tons of speed and capacity,but the game keeps crashing.I raraely get to finish a round that doesn't crash or present incomplete renderings,or have the avatar disappear completely. I never had this sort of problem before with a much smaller and slower computer.Ea Sports and microsoft should figure this one out together."
1,DO NOT BUY if you have Window XL media edition 2005,"I was diappointed when i read the instrutions book.YOU had to disable your internet security,end processes of 13 of your window functions just to load the game from the dics.THEN you had to do all this each and everytime you played the game. If you DID NOT this, then sooner or later your windows would CRASH!!I tryed for [3] days to get this to work right and finally gave up and sent it back to amazon at a loss of mailing charges.This to me is a screw up on EASPORTS part.they did not produce this in mind of the difficulity on older computers,they were thinking ONLY of late model widows or Vista."
3,Fun but ........,"The game is fun to play and the visual effects are great, but the game is slow between shots which makes it take twice as long as it should to play. My machine has more than enough power to run the game, seem to here this alot from other players. Also game locked up and it lost the player profile I had created, it takes quite a bit of playing time to build up a good profile. EA tech said the file must have gotten corrupted and can not be recovered, which means I have to start all over again! Not sure if that was just a non-answer answer? That sucks!"
4,Likes and Dislikes,"Likes:Music only option--I really like this, as I find her chatter annoying.Simple steps; her usual ones, not requiring too much concentration on stepsVariety using the intervalsDislikes:Need printed, on-the-screen lead in to step changesSomewhat rough transition between intervals, especially after the 3rd intervalCan do without the ""whoop, whoop, whoop"" annoying noises in the cool downStretch seems rushed.Overall, I believe this one helped me avoid weight gain during the holidays."
4,It goes fast,"I like this DVD because the 2 miles go by quickly and and I relly feel like I've had a workout. I also like the fact that it can be done to music only. When you listen to these tapes day after day you get to know what she will say next, and then I get bored."
2,The Big Burn,"I am a fan of Leslie. I have highly recommended her to many of my friends. She is great, but this is not one of her best. I was eagerly waiting for it to come out. It is a very bad production. The camara is always moving. It looks like a home production. The good thing it is very short and I use it when I don't have too much time."
2,This One Cured Me,"The good news is that I am finally cured. I no longer have to keep buying Leslie Sansone DVDs. This one convinced me there's nothing new under Leslie's lights. In fact, I suspect, despite the 2009 release date, that this session was shot several years ago. We've seen Mary Kay slimmer and I can't imagine she regained her weight. The intervals are good. The total is, dare I say it, boring. Pop in one of your other Leslie Sansone DVD's and save your money."
2,Not too happy with this one!,"First I must say that I am a Leslie fan. I have been following her workouts for years and have many of them. Naturally I was excited to see a new workout dvd from her and purchased it right away. I was not thrilled after the first time through it. It seems very un-organized with the same moves being repeated instead of more variety used and also the moves seemed to be sparatically thrown in, just when you would get started into a move(like side steps)she would change it back to a walk. It just seemed very un-Leslie like. I will do it for a quick workout but have liked the others much better."
5,Love these intervals!!,"I own several of Leslie's videos, and this one is my FAVORITE! I love the fast pace and the way these intervals are done. Like another reviewer said, the boost isn't just at the end of each mile, they are mixed right in with the workout. Love the group of walkers too! The only thing I would change about this video is to make it more than 2 miles. Many times I do this one back to back! Another bonus is that the video starts right away without the usual ""check with your doctor, etc"" screens. Also, if you add weighted gloves to it, you'll get a great workout for your upper body as well! Definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for a good boosted walk!! Leslie - PLEASE make another like this with 4 or 5 miles of intervals!! :)"
5,Excellent exercise dvd walk at home with Sansone,"I would go to the gym but the commute and shower requires more time so we tried different exercise DVD's however this is the best one, it has different arm and leg movements, you can do it as intensively as you like and you can do it 5 days a week. I walk at home with my wife and we spend a litle more time together. Excellent exercise dvd walk at home with Sansone."
2,The big burn with Leslie Sansons,Have several other of her walking DVD's and love them. I cannot hear her talking on this one when you choose that version.
5,Leslie Sansone walk at home,This Lady has come up with a great workout that works for anyone who is willing to get off the couch and move . It is simple and works.
5,2-Mile Big Burn!,"I really love the 2-Mile Big Burn when I'm in a hurry! My husband & I have so many of Leslie's walk at home DVD's. Leslie makes it fun to workout with her. Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great. I've been with Leslie and her group for over 1 year, use her DVD's 5x's-6x's a week. We wouldn't trade her for the world!"
2,Not one of her better workouts,"This was a very disappointing workout. Not Leslie's usual type of exciting/fun workout. The music wasn't good, sound track wasn't either. I have many (nearly all) of Leslie's videos and Dvd's and this one is my least favorite. It doesn't make me want to workout."
4,Good Introduction,Well thought out chapters give a good basic grounding for a relatively complex subject. A valuable resource for those in the aircraft field.
4,School book,"I ordered this book for a class I am taking in Bagram Afghanistan, I had no trouble with it being shipped to me and it arrived in about 2 weeks which is fast for the mail here ...thank you guys"
2,"Cute, but...","This is a very cute idea, but the light does not last very long at all. The battery wore out in a matter of days, even though I only had it on for no more than 30 minutes at a time.Get it for the journal, not the light."
4,Amazing,"Amazing is what this book is filled with fun, and a joyous reunion to all oof the many Harry Potter freaks, and fans like my self and many, many others!!!! A wonderful expeirence"
4,Put this on your Disablity Literature Bibliography,"This quirky story about three disabled people who decide to live together in a nice bungalow in the suburbs offers beautiful insight on the quest to be ""normal."" I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore what it means to be vastly different.Great for a Disability Literature class or for any literature class."
4,Cute,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie since I haven't read the comics, but even so, it was still a little different from what I expected (somehow). Overall, it was definitely a funny movie with quite a few unexpected twists and turns, which made it pretty good. Its surely got its sweet parts, but it's not super-terribly mushy, so it's nice. I'd say this movie isn't something I'm regretting purchasing, to me it's a nice little addition to my collection. =]"
5,very cute movie,My 4.5 year old dauther has a lot of Strawberry Shortcake dvd's and this is my personal favorite. She likes it a lot too. And her brothers actually like this one as well- they're 7.
5,Made a little 3 year old girl happy!,"Though I didn't watch this DVD fully, I saw the beginning so I know it worked. I gave it as a Gift to my friends 3 year old girl, and she really likes Strawberry Shortcake, and she was really happy with it."
5,Happily ever after,"We love the Strawberry Shortcake dvds, they are child appropriate, cute and fun to watch for the whole family as well."
3,Its just a greatest hits disc,"When I saw Mixin' It Up in the title I thought it would be remixes and alternate versions of songs. Its not. I already have all of the Dan Reed Network catalog, so this was not needed. If you are a fan of the DRN there are two that were slightly remixed, but not enough for me to get the album.I do love me some DRN, but I was disappointed that this is not a remix album."
3,Dented Coyne,"In this one, both Brady Coyne and especially Tapply seem to be a bit world-weary. The plotting is weaker and more forced than usual in Tapply's books and the development and especially the denouement of his mystery is much weaker than we have come to expect from Tapply. Coyne spending a lot of time wondering like some big-city Jimmy Carter about sexual desires for another woman gets a bit tiresome. Still Tapply makes for easy reading and Coyne is one of the most interesting of such series characters."
2,Pretty disappointing,"The oboe soloist, Marc Schachman, is not very good at all. He sounds constantly one step behind the rest of the group and misses far too many notes for a profession musician. There are plenty of good historical performances available on the oboe (try Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra's recording of the Mozart oboe concerto) but this is not one of them. The clarinet quartet, a transcription of a violin sonata, comes off pretty well but there's also a smoother recording by L'Archibudelli out there (and it doesn't stand up as one of Mozart's more important works). The string quartet (one of the so-called ""Prussian"") is quite fine, as the string players are pretty strong. Since the general quality of the recording is relatively poor, however, you might as well get Quatuor Mosaique's version and avoid the sloppy oboe quartet that opens this disc. It's too bad because the price is right, but the quality isn't up to par."
4,Ehh,This was not the useful manual it was described to me to be but that description came from a collegue who was an architect. It should be limited for use as a historical method of teaching the subject.
4,CD,Everything was perfect. Only fault...the jewel case was cracked when it arrived. Will need to purcahse on new jewel case.
5,the best of Bruce,"This is a great collection of Hornsby's greatest. While I prefer his earlier work, this collection shows the changes that came from years of making music. The first five songs are some of the greatest of their kind, and have been since their release. Overall the collection is greaet and is in need of a good listening to."
3,Distorted,"I like Bruce Hornsby's music, although much of it sounds like the same melody with minor variations. But I kept turning the volume down on this disc, when I normally like the volume up. That speaks of too much distortion in the recording process.By comparison, The Best of Sting was purchased at the same time and it sounds great, clear and easy on the ears."
3,adidas response cushion 15 running shoe,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
5,good hand-held but easy games,"Sure, the system rocks, and so do the games. The only problem, is that I beat the games in a matter of days. I have Mario Advance, Street fighter, Dave Mirra, and Warioland 4. I've beaten them all in, at the most two weeks. Street Fighter,Dave Mirra, and Wario, I beat in like 5 days. The games are too easy. Hopefully Gamecube will be better."
3,Good but theres better.,It's a really good system but with the release of the sp it's kind of pointless. Spend the extra money.
3,To see or not to see,"I am 27, and have been a fan of Nintendo for years. I remember buying the original Gameboy back in the day, and rockin' Tetris like it was the bomb or something. Anyway, the GBA is here, and overall it is an impressive system..lots of games, good graphics, lightweight, etc. One problem, and it is nothing new to the Gameboy systems...you can't see the screen!! Put a backlight in it, ya herd?? Whut?? Step up to da plate Nintedno,and lsten to me"
4,Bad light?,"I am looking through these reviews and i see so many low star reviews talking about bad lighting. i got a gba about 4 months ago and i have never had a single lighting problem since then. this system is fantastic. it has fantasic games including mario advance 1 and 2, castlevania and my personal favorite, Sonic Advance. don't wait a minute. this system is the best handheld ever. GET IT!!!!!"
4,I love it,"Having grown up with the C64, the NES and the Amiga, I was very interested in the GBA when it came. Now I've finally purchased one together with Castlevania - The Circle of Moon.I've only really played one game on it so far (only briefly tested Wario World in the store), but I like the GBA. If you've done a bit of research on the GBA, you've probably read complaints about the dark screen. This is true. I bought a Flood Light, but it only helps so much and it all becomes a little bulky. I'll probably get a light kit from portablemonopoly.com soon. I deducted one star for the dark screen.The steering pad thingy is a little less ergonomic than I'd like. After a while, my hands will ache.Other than this, I've no more complaints. A great toy, especially for us older gamers who like sideway scrollers."
4,Great but hard to see,"(i'm actually thirteen but i didn't want to become a member.)I love Game Boy Advance. I am a Sony kind of person but when my neighbor got this i had to get one too, and i got the coolest color - glacier! The only problem is, it's hard to see! It's not backlit, and i think that is a real problem as most games are dark, and even if you get a light to put in, it takes up a lot of the battery power. So if you get this and you play at home a lot, i recommend you get a outlet adapter."
4,Do NOT Buy This Unless You Want to Ruin Your Child's Eyes,"You can HARDLY read the screen at all. I even went back to a store that sells these because I thought mine was defective. They Told me EVERYONE HAS PROBLEMS SEEING ANYTHING ON THESE SCREENS! Then they sold me a useless accessory for $ 4.95 which was supposed to magnify and add light for greater visibility. It was actually designed for these poorly designed toys! I cannot believe that this toy was allowed to be manufactured. The problem is that my child loves it so much, he doesn't want me to return it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Almost Perfect,"From a styling and design perspective Nintendo has a hit. Too bad you cannot see the screen. You cannot use it in low light situations. Nintendo may have solved the battery drain problem; but if you can't see the screen, what's the point! I had to return it."
1,"horrible!!! defected item...what a bad deal like new in very good condition is so freaking wrong you get brokem ,defected crap!",i would not recommend this seller at all..it is a hoax what ever this seller sells is boken defected and absolutly run down looking!dont buy something from that seller!i surely never ever again! shame on them to rip off people like that!
4,Very Good,"I used to own a game boy color, but i updated to a gba, for the better sound and graphics. I found that the ONLY downside is that it has no backlight. I am going to buy a gba light and sheild asap to fix that, and i will reveiw it too. I am just starting to collect games, as i only have one, but i am hoping it will be a long time before i get bored and get a gba sp. the price is good, but if you really want a good experience, and you have the money, get a Nintendo DS. My brother has one, and he enjoys it. The downside to a DS is they only have 3 or 4 good games out."
5,The BEST Gameboy yet!,"Easy on the hands, bigger screen, backwards compatible with all the other Gameboy games... enough said!"
2,Shoddy Screen leads to no fun,"Here's a little warning before you invest in the GBA:1) The LCD screen itself isn't backlit, so it's hard to see unless your under a solid light source2) The plastic screen over the LCD screen sratches very easily! I even bought a replacement from nintendo.com and it sratched in less than two weeks!"
5,outstanding grafix for such a small system,i am sorry but i cant write a 1000! word review ... but if you ask me its perfact for travel and big intertainment for such a small system and thus i say i love it and hope you take my review into a count .........
5,"NintenDoh! Good Handheld, great games!","Awesome. Gamecube hookup=no more of your friend looking over at your side of the split-screen to see where your secret hideout is. Do not, I mean, do NOT use any non-nintendo product (like nyko, or pelican) on your GBA, not limited to but especially link cables. These can totally crash your GBA and/or games."
2,Come on really!!,"I bought this gameboy first of all because i wanted to start playing my pokemon games again, but i was really disspointed at the gameboy i purchased. First of all i know it is a used gameboy and i expected some wear and tear, but when the gameboy was advertised as new screen and in good condition you would expect it to be as such, right? but no i got this gameboy and the screen is so scratched that you cant barely see the game in most light, and the back latch for the battery compartment broke off by day two. this is ridiculous and i will never purchase from this seller again."
2,Where's the game? Cause i can't see it!!,"I couldn't wait for the gameboy advanced to come out. So when it did, i bought one of the first to hit the stores. As well as, two games. I loved super nintendo and this looked it would be the hand held version of that.However, one of the main drawbacks of the gameboy advanced is that there is NO.. I repeat... NO backlighting!!! If you aren't sitting directly under a bright spotlight you wont see a thing! I bought the gameboy so I would have something to do on my long train rides to the city but i spent half the ride trying to direct the gameboy in such a way that i could see it. Before i completely gave up on using it i bought one of the light attachments that where ""designed"" for gameboy advanced. But that didn't help either. In fact it add a bad glare which made it harder to see. I'm so frustrated with it that it's been sitting in the corner collecting dust."
4,Fun but dark,"Purchased for my daughter as gift. It is very comfortable, lightweight and well made. I highly recommend purchasing a wormlight for this item. The screen requires a lot of light, you are unable to see the game screen in a low light area or it can even give off a glare making it impossible to see the screen. Wormlights are cheap, no big deal! An economical and easy way to play your Nintendo on the road."
5,Great For Long Car Rides!,"My brother received this console for Christmas, and he loves it. The only disadvantage to it is that he's glued to the thing and Mom gets real mad at him, but besides that, it's a great distraction. Portable, works fine. It even plays regular Game Boy Color games also, so you don't have to worry about never being able to use those games. The games that go with it are about an inch tall and two inches wide - very compact. Get a case for it and you're set to go!"
4,"Very Good Console, not the screen cover.","the game boy advace is a nice console, 32- bit cpu and more memory than game boy color. But there is one problem that i don't like and thats the screen cover, because it is easily scratched. Nintendo should change the screen cover from plastic to something else because i'm just plain sick of scratching my screen."
5,Best hand held system there is,"The GBA is the best hand held system there is, in my opinion, because it...has the ability of a PSOne (even if the length of the games are alittle shorter) and it is completely backwards compatable. It'll play the games of GB, GB Pocket, GB Color, and the GB Advance games of course. So...if you have old games you want to play, you don't have to use an old system, this one still works. The con I can think of is..no back lighting. But the GBA SP has front lighting, so that's being solve I guess. But if this is all you can afford, I'd grab it becuase it's good for on the go gaming."
4,Great Way to Keep Entertained!,"Got this for my son for Christmas, even though I'm not a fan of these -- the last thing I want is a couch-potato kid spending hours on a chair playing this. But I've given in, and my son is happy, although I monitor when and how long he plays. Why I chose the GBA vs the GB Color? Two reasons: it resembles the controllers for the GameCube (and other game system controllers) so there's familiarity in how to hold it and use it. Also, the GBA takes GB, GB Color, and GB Advance games, so there's more variety than with just the GB Color. We'll eventually try to link the GBA to our GameCube, and that may be yet another plus for this little machine. I do find that the screen is kind of dark, even with the light/brightness up, but other than that it's a great buy."
4,GameBoy Advance,"I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 because if you look at the picture you can see multiple colors on the screen. I thought the GameBoy Advance was going to be like a prototype for the DS (one screen with a bunch of colors) but I was wrong. You have to be by a light source like you do with the Game Boy and Game Boy Color but still have the slight glare of the mentioned light on the screen. The games for the GBA can be played on the DS (bottom slot) with a full array of color. The console works like new and plays games smoothly, I just had a problem with the lack of brightness/color it had. It can play GB color games which is a plus if you want to play like games with a friend (Pokemon was my pick here).I already have a Game Boy Color, SNES, Wii, and a DS for the reason that I am a big fan of Nintendo's line of work but for the time the GBA came out I can say it was a leap forward same goes for N64 to the Wii."
5,good,works good but didnt come with a ac adapter or anything but overall is a good product i would reccomend to anyone
4,i would give it 5 stars but...,"I would give the Gameboy Advanced 5 stars but even though it is an awesome hand-held, there are better systems such as the GP32, but the GP32 cost $150 so forget that. Another problem is that it's not backlit, but that can be fixed with the $35 Afterburner Kit from Triton Labs (TritonLabs.com). It's an awesome upgrade if you have the skills with a soldering iron and the nerve to mess around inside the Gameboy. Overall, this is a cool system."
5,DON'T SKIP OVER GBA IN PLATINUM!,"This baby's perfect exepet your hands get real sweaty w/o the battery grip (6 bucks) great graphics, better sound. Don't forget to accesorize!!!!"
5,I love it!!!,"The Game Boy Advance (Glacier) is a wonderfully entertaining product. The graphics are phenomenal for most games and the controls are awesome. For us people with larger hands, your fingers might get a bit cramped after playing for a while, but it's a trade-off for it being so compact. The GBA is perfect for all ages except the very young and with a huge variety of games, there is something for everyone. I play it when travelling and after hard days at work. Also, the Glacier color is awesome! My only complaint about it is that the screen is not backlit. Maybe there's a reason for that besides price, but if you have decent lighting, you can see the screen just fine. You'll be amazed at the huge amount of colors and well, just about everything else! Buy this unit...especially at such a great price!"
4,GBA,"I must say I was somewhat disappointed in the GBA. The graphics are outstanding, but there is still no backlight, which makes it difficult to see. I have a qorm light, but it's annoying and only lights the ceter of the screen. By not backlighting, Nintendo is increasing battery life, but I don't think that is nearly as important as game play.My other complaint is game selection. So far I have only played two games worth buying, although I own four. One is Tony Hawk Two, and the other is Mario Kart: Super Circuit. Both are outstanding games one can play for hours, and are the reasons of my four star rating. Other than these, however, there are very little.Overall, I would recommend this if you travel a lot or want something to play when not at home, but otherwise just buy a console. I recommend Xbox, but gamecube would be better for younger gamers, as are all nintendo products."
3,It's ok,The only thing my grandson dislikes is that the screen is too dim. Otherwise it's a good game system.
1,This was garbage,The screen went blank on me in just 2 days. The screen was so hard to see anything even under very good lighting and after changing the batteries twice. Save your money and get a DS.
3,"Okay, but DARK","Good system so far, but the screen is HORRIBLY dim.Be glad a good many of Nintendo's games are ""bright and cartoonish"" because if the games don't have bright colors, it is painfully dark to view.Sit under a bright light ( and I do mean bright), hold the screen just right, and it looks and plays great; otherwise.... DARK.Nintendo should have been able to do a little better with this, but ..., it is okay."
5,This Rocks!!...,This new and improved GBA is the most fun thing you can possibly do.Try it!!! There are lots of wonderful games out there to. Buy it from Amazon because it is the fastest of all sites beleve me. This color is the best it is a clear light purple. Look for deals on games...Still this is a encredeble deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Dissapointing,What were nintendo thinking a hand held for 100.00 moola?BesidsI was really dissipointed when I got the GBA and I think it totaly copyed SNK's Neo Geo from the cartrige to the shape and layout of the system. the display dosent really look like its 32 bit I mean my SEGA Genisess (16 bit) look's beter.And it's really to thin for my hands unlike the Neo Geo witch is fatter on the out side and thinner on the inside.Besides nintendo's game boy has allwes been sorta outa date like wheres the backup battery or why dosent a menu appere when you turn it on with out a cartrige.Other than that the systen is kinda good bui if I were you I wold save my GBA money and buy a cheaper Sega Game gear or a SNK Neo Geo.
5,The BEST!!!!,When my cousin and I were at the beach he let me borrow his GBA Artic color. I wasn't crazy about the Artic color but when I saw the see-through blue you called Glacier at Toys R Us I knew that that GBA was going to be at the top of my Birthday List and my Christmas List. I'm also crazy about Super Mario games including Mario Kart and Mario Party. So if you could prepare a value pack with two Mario games I would empty my piggy bank for that package. It would be the absolute best!
3,So So,This game is kinda fun except you can never see the screen! It is way to dark and when you get the light attachment that makes even it worse! Plus the graphics aren't to good. If you are gonna buy a game boy get the Game Boy Advance SP. It has a built in light and better graphics.
1,Not worth the price,"My son bought the Game Boy Advance Console, after using it for awhile, we realized that it is very difficult to see the screen. We then bought the light and magnifier kit, this did not help it either. If your going to buy a Game boy, spend the extra money and get the Game Boy Advance SP it's worth the extra money."
3,A Decent Handheld,"I wasn't a big fan of the Game Boy Advance, though it might be partly because I'm not a big handheld fan, so I won't be too harsh. The graphics are better than the Game Boy Color, but they're not great. There are more buttons than the GBC, and the screen is bigger, which is nice. You can also play GBC games on it (and I think the original Game Boy games, too), and when playing the older games, you can either have the screen the original size, or you can press a button to make it fill the screen, but this will stretch the images. There is a good variety of games, like Zelda, Mario, Kingdom Hearts, etc.So overall, the GBA isn't a super exciting handheld, but if you like handhelds, it's perfectly fine."
1,Eeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww!!,"Nintendo just wants another excuse for making money. It's the same as Game Boy Color, except it's horizontal. I don't like it. It's too sideways."
1,Don't go blind trying to play this game...,"I recently purchased this item for my daughter and returned it after 2 days. The dislay is so hard to see that some games were unplayable. The light we bought only added more glare and believe me there was enough to start with. Overall 2 big thumbs down. In the days of backlit PDA's and beautiful color Windows runnning on portable devices, it is a huge disappointment that you can't optionally get a backlit screen unit. That I'd pay for. P.S. I hear Sega games will soon be available for play on Windows CE devices... might wait for that."
1,DON'T buy this!!!,"I can't beleive they sell these! Even with the additional light you can not see a thing, the screen is so dark. Our son had a headache 2 hours after buying it, and was using the light, a lamp and by a window. And be warned - it comes with NOTHING! No game, no patch cord, no outlet adaptor or light unit.... We returned it the next day..."
1,Poor product,I can't believe that Nintendo released this product. The screen is so dark that it is impossible to see well enough to play the game. My children are anxious to play with it but it puts too much strain on their eyes. Wait until Nintendo improves this and releases a new version. Buy your kids some great books instead!
4,Buy this!!,"A big step up from game boy color,Good graphics and sound.You can even play game boy and game boy color games on it.The glacier color is very pretty."
3,Not Much Different From Gamboy Coler,"Da biggest difference is da graphics, da graphics look sumwhat lik Supernintedo, which isn,t so bad since it is so small. But I think dey should stop worryin 'bout makin da smallest handheld video game system an worry 'bout makin' do smallest video game system with graphics like Playstation1, or at leass Sega Saturn, fo reel. But ta me Gameboy Advance ain't as great as some pepole say it is."
2,SP HAS SUCCSESFULLY REPLACED,do not spend money on this game boy.the SP is totally better.it is a cool folding platform. and is so portable.it has a baklight unlike the GBA. and a way better design.the only people that like the GBA is the people that cant get a SP.
3,my gameboy advance,"I like the color because it looks nice. I can also see inside the gameboy advance.I don't like it because it dosen't have lights inside it. It was the very first color for gameboy advance. The screan gets dirty. Back then I liked the gameboy advance itself. I am going to still keep it. It is heavy, It is small. I don't like the fashion. I also don't like the cartridge design. And where the cartilige goes. I am getting bored of it because it been soooooooooooooooooooooooo long. And because I am getting bored of the design. ..."
3,gameboy vs.neo geo 11 year gamer,"some people think just because it got the word ""game boy"" on it dosent mean its the best.Neo Geo is far ahed in the game!Neo geo was bougt by the maker of game boy,to have a game boy advanced.Not fair to us Neo Geo gamers!"
2,My eyes! My eyes!,"You'll go blind playing this thing unless you are outside on a sunny day. Why in the world isn't the screen lighted? None of the aftermarket lights you can buy are worth a darn. What a shame, because the games are cool, but I can't see a thing."
3,Is This Pricey Game Really Worth The Dough?,"Are you planning to get a game boy advance? If you are, there are some things you should know. It may have cool graphics, great color, and awesome 3-d power, but unless you can buy a wormlight you're pretty much stuck. I got a game boy advance and some really radical games, but I could barely see the screen. I had to spend [more money] on a wormlight. You're probably saying well hey get this kid some glasses. I already have glasses. So unless you're willing to buy a wormlight don't get a game boy advance."
3,not satisfied,I received the package and it was torn and the battery cover did not come with it so I have to put tape on it so the batteries will not fall out. This was suppose to have been a gift but I couldn't give it to them looking like that. I was not PLEASED.
5,ready for gamecube,I think that GBA is great expessialy with gamecube.The games so far are good to.Now my cousin wants to come over and play.Now all I want is mario cart super circuit.
5,Great to be able to replay older games,I think it's great that Nintendo is re-releasing NES games on to the gameboy advance. I was a huge fan of the Dragon Warrior games and it's great to be able to play them again. The only draw back is the fact that you have to have lots of light to see the screen but quite frankly that's a minor inconvenience especially since there are accessories a person can buy that attach to the GBA to provide light for it.
5,GBA is worth every penny!,"I've been wanting a Game Boy Advance since Christmas (being the Nintendo freak I am) and I finally got one! Even though I've only had it for two days, it has become my new favorite thing,(with the exception of my Gamecube)! The graphics are exceptional, and it is so light weight. You can take it anywhere! I love the pretty light blue color. I would recomend either getting Super Mario Advance or Warioland 4 to go along with a new GBA."
4,Mine at last!!!,"I bought this as a gift for a friend a couple of years ago. It got a lot of milliage and he used it quite a bit. Still in great working condition, it is now mine. (My friend bought himself an Gameboy Advanced SP).Now, this is a pretty good item, especially if you want to use it in conjunction with the GameCube (It makes Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles quite a bit more fun. Note: You only use this on that game when playing multi-player; but it is necessary to have if you are playing multi-player).Now for the big question: Is it worth $30 more dollars to get a cooler gameboy that is backlit? I think the answer is yes. Especially if you are considering buying this for a friend or child, go with SP."
1,Terrible Display,"For such great graphics one would think that Nintendo engineers would want people to see them. Average indoor lighting makes for bad gaming, and you can forget about back seat of your car enjoyment. Thumbs way down... Nintendo spring for a light bulb. What were you thinking? Guess I will wait in the returns line."
3,It was a good start...,"but spend the extra money and pick up an SP! The GBA SP puts the GBA to shame. For the extra 30 dollars, you get a lighted screen, which helps tremendously. The rechargeable battery saves probably about that 30 dollars in a year just in battery costs! If you must buy this GBA, I recommend you pick up a light and magnifier combo. When I was a child I had the original GameBoy, and had no light or magnifier. I had 20/20 vision to that point, and the next year after owning the Game Boy for a year, I needed glasses. The light you need to get for this GBA should be a light on the side with a magnifier. If you buy a worm light or the like, it just reflects off the screen."
1,ahhhh!!!,"it was my birthday, and my parents gave a game boy advance, i was totally happy, until i began to playdit was dark to the bone i only could play under a super brilliant lightmy advice is dont you buy it, the game boy color its much better..."
3,Gameboy Advance,"This is a very good portable game player, although it does not have a backlight it still works very well. I would recomend ""The Gameboy Advance SP"" but this is much cheaper and the only difference is it doesn't flip or have a backlight, still get this product it is worth the money!"
3,Save your money,"Save your money. The GBA is a huge dissapointment. Save up and buy the new GBA SP for only $ 40.00 more. For more info why, read the reviews others and I wrote about the GBA SP."
3,Pros and cons,"Gameboy advance is very fun and most of the game have excellent graphics but the game screen is hardly visible without a light. I think it would have been much much better if it had a self illumuinating screen (if anyone remembers the lnyx handheld it had one of these, it was excellent) the problem with using a game light is that the screen is highly reflective and the light glares off the screen, making it hard to see at times. The screen also scratches very easily, so get something to protect it, you'll be glad you did. If Nintendo makes any new innovations with this product i hope they add a self illuminating screen, but honestly i don't thing it will happen because then they can't sell light to everyone who owns one."
3,"Great Beer and Pretzels Game - High on Fun, Low on History","When board wargaming was in its golden age, we called easy to learn, fun-to-play games good ""Beer and Pretzel"" games. Legion is a good game and poor simulation of ancient Roman warfare. If you want an accurate computer simulation of ancient warfare during the heyday of the Roman Empire, keep looking. If you want an easy to learn game with an ancient flavor, Legion works fine. I was put off by the basic graphics at first and limited strategic options, but once I learned how the game worked, I found the entertainment value worth the purchase. Buy this game for fun and entertainment, not for historical simulation."
1,HORRIDLY BAD,"Stay away. Stay FAR AWAY.This game might (MIGHT) have been acceptable in the late 80s, but I doubt it. The graphics are ugly and primitive. The interface looks like a VGA dos strategy game like Settlers 1, and is unclear and hard to use. The game is plagued by numerous video bugs.But all that would be ignorable if the gameplay were even OK. Unfortunately, the gameplay [is bad]. It's basically Ancient Art of War for the Apple II with (slightly) updated graphics. The cover illustration is the best thing about this ..., unimaginative, rushed title.Do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money on something good, ..."
1,You'd have more fun driving nails into your foot,"Alright, this game has graphics that look like they were inherited from Civilization 2. There's nothing to complain about in reference to the strategy portion of the game, since it's pretty standard, but the real time portion will make you lose the will to live. You deploy your soldiers and then helplessly watch as they run around the map and fight the enemy. Yes, I'm not kidding, you actually can't control the army in battle, it's reduced to you sitting there watching little soldier A throw things at little soldier B until one of them dies or runs away. The idea that you can't make real time changes during a battle is rather absurd, and as a result of the game design there's no strategy, you might as well wander off and do something interesting while the battles are running. This game hurts brain."
1,Don't Bother,Poorly made. Much better strategy games out on the market. A let down after playing Europa II and Medieval Total War
1,Sad...very sad.,"I WAS looking forward to this game, but after thirty minutes of play I felt like I was playing something that should run on a low powered Commodore 64. There is virtually no diplomacy, the game mechanics are rustic, anachronistic and extremely boring, there is no internal decision making to add any flavor to the game and ultimately it is like managing a warehouse with three materials and making sure the shelves are stocked. The battles are even worse. They are a big mess and it makes no difference where you position your troops they always end up in the same spot...all lumped in a big ugly, indecipherable mess in the middle of the screen. I loved both Europa Universalis games and was extremely disapointed with this sad game. However I am still loking forward to Paradox's Crusader Kings, I still have hope."
3,Flawed game by with a few pluses,"Legion is a flawed game, but it is old and you can buy a copy for $7. The city growth is oddly limited, so no city can build every type of building offered. Why is this? I could not tell you. The Real Rome had every type of building the Romans could build; and all Roman cities were just a copy of Rome. It is worth $7, not $8, but $7 is a good price for this game. Wyatt Kaldenebrg"
3,Reviewing Legion,"Nothing new here for folks that ever played Centurion of Rome. The graphics are better, and the campaigns more in depth. Command and control of armies is limited at best, which is supposed to more realistic. Had this gone farther and included some later scenarios this would be worth the price. Buffs of ancient Rome will enjoy this probably, but consider carefully before commiting your computer gaming dollars."
3,Not very good.,"Definitely not worth what I payed. Very, very disappointing. It was fun, until I figured out what formation was unbeatable."
2,"Good work-out, shoddy construction","I gave one of these to my wife for Christmas 2005. She used it 3 or 4 times a week for about a year until it broke. Specifically, the weld that connects the axle to the frame broke. My wife is not a heavy person -- 120 lbs. max. So I echo what other reviewers have said: this product is not built to last. I called Gaiam and asked for a replacement, they said no."
4,What I needed for a 25 min. workout,"This Gaiam mini stepper seems well made (I've had it a month and use it 2-3x per week), gives a workout that's just enough for my mornings, and coupled with yoga, skiing, and biking, is a nice addition to my regular activities. Don't expect a heart-pumping work out like a stairmaster... I break a sweat and elevate my heartrate some. It really works the thighs and calves. The rubber arm bands are pretty useless, handweights are better. Good to have a chair or something you can grasp on to near by when working out. CD is helpful and makes the time fly. So far a good machine!"
2,This was not a good purchase,"I'm giving it two stars for potential, only. I got stoked about something small and quiet that I could use inside when the weather was stinky. It came missing a piece, the adjustor knob was broken, the display cracked, and it only worked out my knee joints, as far as I can tell. I returned it within days."
2,the spray stream goes all over the place,"It probably ""works"" fine, but the spray stream isn't well-controlled. It gets on your hand and is so strong that it bounces back out of what ever you spray it on -- you might want to use rubber(?) gloves, wear eye protection, and keep your mouth closed. Or just try a different brand -- hopefully it won't have this problem (or maybe they all do, for all I know)."
1,Not what I expected,This tie is much too short ofr a boy of 13 years old. i expected it to be better quality and to fit the intended young man. I was disappointed in paying for such an item.
1,Waste of time...,"I love how people that havnt even played this game rate it 5 stars. The only reason i gave it one star is because that's the lowest you can select. This game was so horrible, the graphics were the worst i've ever seen on GBA, I am not cheap but I actually took this game back to the store where I bought it and demanded a refund. The missions in the game, a joke, you pretty much walk right into them. And walking around is even a joke, i've never seen such choppy framerate in a game in my life!! Also when you shoot your weapon it's so slow i'm surprised your not dead by the time you get your second shot off. My advice, dont waste your time or money on this game. I would compare this game to Duke Nukem Advance as Duke being a 10 outta 10 and Medal of Honor being a 1 out of Million!!!"
1,Buyer BEWARE,"This game is horrific. The levels are linear and the choice of weapons is lacking. The graphics are so bad I cannot tell if I am shooting a guard or a wall. The graphics make your eyes hurt they are so bad. Most of the time I could not see where I was going. Luckily, I pretended like it didn't work and got a refund. The music is the only good part of this game. This is definately the worst game I have ever played. EVER."
3,OK,"I got Medal of Honor Underground for Christmas along with my new SP. It was actually pretty good. Ok.... the graphics were crap and the nazis blend in too much but, at least when an enemy is in the vincinity the crosshairs lock on to him automatically.Overall, once you get used to the graphics its great, for GBA. The only major pain is you need to remember the passwords for each level. Oh.. and some of the levels are real easy, and im not bragging, this is my first video game system ever and im just a plain vanilla gamer but they couuld euther make the levels longer or have more of them. if you get this youll beat like one to three levels a day, depending on which levels and how long you play a day. Its OK but nothing to write home about"
1,One of the worst games ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is the worst games ever. The graphics suck and the gameplay sucks. If I were you I wouldent even look at this game. I played it at my friends house and it was bad. I recomend that you get meadal of honor infltrator now that game rocks. But dont get meadal of honor underground.
4,SWEET! GAME!,this game rocks i love multiplayer! and all of the other people who hated it well its there loss
1,Words cant even begin to describe how bad this SUCKS!,"You wouldn't even believe how bad ""Medal of Honor: Underground"" for the GBA sucks.I've played MOH since the original on PSX snd have always loved each game in it's series, but this game for the GBA is downright horrible. We are talking ""shouldn't even had been released"" horrible.Gameplay is horrible, jerky and slow action, graphics are terrible.I don't know what the deal is with EA and their GBA games. Its obvious they don't put too much effort into development of GBA games. Madden 2004 is downright horrible on the GBA as well."
1,sucks!!,"graphics suck sounds suck and the graphics give you a huge huge HUGE head ake and you can see the bad guys when there on the other side of the wall, story sucks! everything sucks id rate it a -1000 if i cood p.s. DONT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not worth the price im going to throw mine in the garbage"
5,Revelation made clear,"Wilfrid Harrington has written a clear and enlightening commentary on one of the most difficult books of the Bible. Those who are looking for a commentary that helps with contemporary application of the message of Revelation should definitely consider this one. Some commentaries are so eager to impress that they are unintelligible. This one is scholarly, but, anyone with a serious interest in learning the Bible will find it useful. I highly recommmend it."
3,It is a book that I reccomend.,It is an attractive story. Macon comes to the best decisions for his life. Muriel helps him learn how to live it. But he can't forget Sarah or Ethan. He wants his own life back. Or does he? It is a book that continues to pull at your thoughts. I always wanted to find out what would happen next but some chapters are too boring. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes dramatic story that have a bit funny.
2,"The review of ""The Accidental Tourist""","This ""The Accidental Tourist"" is not interesting. Each chapters is so-so and the story flows slowly. Moreover,having no climax cannot lead the readers to follow the story. But it has the good point,as well.This book can cheer up the person who has desperated life. Like Macon,after the death of his son and the departure of his wife, he attempts to run his own life hopefullyThis book is not very difficult to understand. It is suitable for the students who want to improve their reading skills."
3,Not a great season..,"Many people say that The Simpsons went downhill in Season 12. I have to disagree and say Season 13. Usually I can get through an entire season in a week because the quality is so rich. Now that I have season 13, I'm wondering if I should even bother to begin disk 2. Another problem is that you can ""Play with deleted scenes,"" but the option doesn't actually play the scenes along with the episode. You have to wait until you see a pair of scissors and then press 'enter' on your DVD remote before it disappears to actually watch them. Why have the option to ""play with deleted scenes"" if I have to go through an additional step anyway? Why not just have the pair of scissors pop up when you choose ""play episode?"""
3,Worst. Packaging. Ever.,"The packaging on this particular season of the Simpsons is, without exception, the worst packaging I have ever seen on any DVD. The exterior box is just that... a box. It's not a slipcase as is common with dvd box sets, one literally has to open the side of the box and close it every time. That combined with the flimsy cardboard that the box is made of results in crumpling, wrinkling, and tearing... all of which would be unnecessary if any thought whatsoever had gone into the packaging design. Had I known this when I bought it, I may not have."
4,One of the better seasons on DVD,"I think this season is one of the better one's out on DVD now, though it isn't as good as 4,5,8, or 9. There are alot of great episodes on here that you can watch over and over again and the commentary and other special features are awesome. Well worth the 30 bucks"
5,Simpson's in Hi-Def!!!,"Wow, the Simpson's in Hi-Def Blu-ray! Nothing could be better. The Audio and Video is so clear. So many features! Great price too!"
1,Limited Edition?,"Why exactly is this edition limited? Are there really that many people who want to pay an extra ten bucks for a cheap plastic bubble-eyed Ralph Wiggum face-thing?! At least they didn't have the cheek to call it a 'Special Edition'. The descent into shameless shoddy cheapness continues with yet another collection of accordian boxed crud. Speaking of crud, as John Madden once said in Sunday Cruddy Sunday; ""In retrospect it was sort of a rip-off! What a way to treat the loyal fans who have put up with so much nonsense from this franchise!"" Amen John..."
3,good season back packaging,"i love season 13 my gripe isn't at all with the show, its the packagingi had to clean my disc when i first opened and pulled out the first DVDplease bring back the plastic cases, i have to rebuy season 12 because of this cheap crap packaging"
4,"good show, bad box","This show is timeless. I loved season 13 just like I loved all the previous. Let's be honest, simspons die hard fans will buy it either way. The only thing I have to complain about is this: the box. It is horrible. I bought sons of anarchy on dvd, and it has 4 discs packaged perfectly. Why don't they use that design? Oh, that's right, we have to have tons of pretty pictures of our favorite towns people, how could I forget?Buy this season, it is just as good as the rest of the show. It has highs and lows like every other season, but it is still good."
1,Agonizingly bad,Seasons 1-10 of The Simpsons is the greatest show in TV history and it is unfortunate that this show has been allowed to limp into its 23rd season and the horrible seasons now outweigh the great. It's as if the writers just stopped caring and I can't think of anyone who would want to buy this. Horrible season of a once great show.
2,This is the last of the Simpsons seasons I'll buy,"Simply put, this is where the series starts to tank. The writers that took The Simpsons through the glory years are long gone (or fast asleep) and this season just isn't up to par with it's predecessors. Some people say the decline happened earlier, and some say it happens later. But to me, this is ground zero. So long Simpson family."
1,bad aspect ratio,"Im disappointed that the blu ray version is in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio. I was expecting/hoping that they would have formatted it out to fill flat screen televisions by now. If you are expecting this in wide screen, don't waste your money, it is still formatted for old people tube televisions"
5,Meet Danny Wilson Indeed!,"In the days of vinyl, this record was always on my turntable! I have since bought the CD and keep it in my car to play at a moment's notice. This pop/jazz/rock album is hard to categorize except for the constant reflections of Steely Dan in the voiceand music. ""Mary's Prayer"" and ""A Girl I used to Know"" are the standout tracks, but ""Aberdeen"" is my personal favorite. The music is smooth, hook-laden and the lyrics are insightful. Enjoy!"
2,Mediocre 80s Pop,"""Mary's Prayer"" is a good song. But the rest of this album was pretty forgetable. I was disappointed. If you're like me and are considering buying this because you liked what you heard in ""There's Something About Mary,"" buy the soundtrack instead."
3,Say Ten Hail Marys,"Ah, to be the glorious one hit wonder that was ""Mary's Prayer!"" With a vocalist that sounded like a passable Donald Fagen and clean crisp jazzy pop playing, Danny Wilson sounded like the next big sophisticated thing. And while their American Debut album frequently alluded to ""Pretzel Logic/Katy Lied"" Steely Dan, it also veered off to the more boring moments of the Doobie Brothers. Which is to say that the music relies more on sound than substance.It did make for a few noteworthy songs. ""Davy,"" ""Aberdeen"" ""Steam Trains to the Milky Way"" and ""Five Friendly Aliens"" all evoked the Steely Dan enigma, but most of the rest of ""Meet Danny Wilson"" lacked the all important hook quotient. But if ""Mary's Prayer"" still tugs at your memory all these years later (as it still does me), then this disc is worth hanging on to. A little searching through a few ""Best Of The 80's"" anthologies might turn it up, as will the soundtrack to ""There's Something About Mary."""
4,Had Mary's Prayer been released ten years later,"it probably would have been a top five hit. Instead, it was Danny Wilson's bad fortune Prayer came out in the late 80's when the charts were filled with lots of hits, flooded with new music and dominated by superstar acts like Madonna, U2, George Michael, et al. Mary's Prayer is one of those great songs with staying power. Sounds good twenty years later."
5,Great Band,I was suprised to find this in print. I was listening to it at the office today and one of my employees said they used to have it on vinyl. I actually saw them live in '87 opening for Simply Red. Incredible show - it is not very often that the opening act blows you away like they did.
5,Useful Work for Unskilled Women,"This book was sent very fast and and I have enjoyed it a lot.The history of the WPA projects in Milwaukee are very interesting and have begun a journey for me, as a doll designer, to create similar dolls and to work with the Museum in Milwaukee to see about recreating some of them from the original patterns.SIncerelyJudi Ward"
4,Miles of Smiles,"This is the definitive Pete Droge album to own... heavy, melodic, sublime, at times pensive but often so euphoric - a great collection of original songs which rise and swirl, filling the air with a wall of sound. Previous albums were Tom Petty-influenced and nowhere near the same quality excepting, of course, the wonderful Dear Diane. Some songs on this album require repeated listenings to allow them the chance to grow, but grow they will. If you chance upon this album don't be afraid to buy it, it'll make you smile."
3,An album with an equal number of hits and misses..,"A few years from now this album will probably be seen as transitional. To be honest these songs are great fun live, but on the CD they don't contain the same emotional depth. When I want to hear Pete, I find myself putting on the earlier more introspective albums. They're less in your face noise. Regardless, do yourself a big favor and go see him while he's still touring the smaller clubs."
3,"Good, Not Great","I enjoyed this disc, but there are several CD CDs I enjoy a lot more. This is a mediocre effort."
3,Treo 650 Stylus,"Top plastic tip of the old stylus broke. This replacement set is a good value, but it is too loose to stay in its holder and does not have a snug fit in its holder. Stylus slides out if the Treo is turned upside down."
3,Palm Stylus,"The price for the three Stylus pens was great. I like the idea of having a writing pen built inside the stylus. The only drawback is that the stylus is not a tight fit in the slot for the Palm 700wx and is prone to fall out. I have already lost one, so its a good thing you get three!"
5,Replacement stylus with pen,"These are great! Wish I'd ordered them YEARS ago. Stylus fits Treo 700wx perfectly AND doesn't fall out. I've only used pen once--to test it out. It worked fine, but after years of not having stylus with pen I can't remember to use it!Definitely recommend. Great price; great product."
4,What I asked for,Got exactly what I ordered in a timely manner and it works. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
1,Didn't deliver what was promised,"User promised Treo 650 Stylus pack, but delivered Treo 600 styluses. Very dissatisfied."
4,Treo Stylus,"The stylus works as well as the OEM stylus.Much easier, especially if you have fat fingers."
3,Good but not great,These work fine but feel a bit chinsy compared to the original stylus I had. I haven't used the pen option yet.
1,"don't trust the picture, don't waste your money","there is no pen in the stylus, if you're looking for a combined stylus with pen, keep on looking forward this stylus is not like pictured"
3,Lots of typos and missing info.,"Good study guide when the answers were in the back. Sometimes the answers were off by one or non existent. If you can get past that, it does help, but jeez don't they employ a proofreader? For thirty bucks, I was kind of disappointed. The textbook is great."
3,It's ok,It's an okay book. I needed it for a class. There are several mistakes on the diagrams (our professor noted which ones).
1,Waste of money,I bought this book and never needed it to help me study. It was a waste of my money. I gave it away shortly after I bought it.
2,it sounds too much like strung out,"In this cd it seems like good riddance want to sound more like strung out, then have there own sound. But songs like come dancing, a credit to his gender, and steps are awesome songs. Then there follow up cd to this ones is the best."
5,What can I say? It's Good Riddance!,"Fantastic album. Last Believer is one of, if not, the best song ever written. The cd starts and ends before you know it because all the songs are great. Buy this and all of GR's cds. See them live. You have never seen so much energy on stage until you see Good Riddance live. 5 Star CD."
5,Frio pack,"This product really does work! It is an excellent way to carry insulin!well worth the money,"
1,Ridiculous,"I started reading this book fully expecting to be impressed. I wasn't. To begin with, the writing is all over the place. In the middle of making a point the author goes off on a ""patriotic"" tangents and doesn't seem to give any clear reasoning. As for the content, the idea of our ""allies"" in Europe and ""tolerance"" seem nice unless you know anything about the European Union and the new world order. If so, the book reads like on big piece of propaganda. ""Trust the Federal Reserve?"" And while your at it, throw out your constitutional rights in the name of security.I concider myself a very patriotic person who is proud to live in America but, if our forefathers had simply relied on their country's leaders to think for them, America wouldn't exist."
1,"Rosie's are red, Violets are blue...","This book's the paper that should clean my poo.Synergies his core competencies, but unlike his oft-quoted UPS, does not deliver."
4,A breath of fresh air,"Raw, aggressive, powerful...What more do you want? Yes, the lead singer does a weird thing with his voice sometimes, but you will forget that when you hear the awesome riffs and powerful screams that follow. 36 Crazyfists' lyrics are just, wow... they scream emotion.36 Crazyfists is still in their early phases trying to perfect their sound, hopefully they wont start going for a more pop metal sound in their next album like so many bands nowadays.Highlights from this album include:'TurnsToAshes', 'Slit Wrist Theory', 'Circle The Drain' and of course 'Eighteenminutesupsidedown' and 'Ceramic'."
4,A great sounding and underrated band.,"I might be biased a little since these guys hail from Alaska, and that's where I live, but this is a great band. Heavy as hell, great musicianship and thoughtful lyrics along with Brock's unique vocal style make this a must have. Their second outing, ""A Snow Capped Romance"" is actually better and more mature, but you won't be disappointed in ""Bitterness"" either. I think the fact that they lived in Alaska contributes to their sound, they probably had influences from all over the country but yet no direct local influence because they were definately one of a kind in this area. Now, much of the Anchorage music scene seems to emulate the sound of 36 Crazyfists. Go figure. Anyway don't pass this one up if you are a true metalhead, old school or nu-school."
4,Churning Energy,"It's great to finally get to hear a release from 36 CF. I first heard ""Circle the Drain"" about 4 years ago and have been waiting for them to get a cd out in stores. Definately worth the wait. The vocals get borderline painful, but good enough. The guitar, bass, and drum sound is good and I like the way they can transition between different grooves in the same song. That is becoming a lost art with bands like Korn who have to play one groove, stop, then start another groove in a song. Transitioning between musical phrases is a definate plus with this album. Check it out."
4,Not your typical singer-not your typical band,"First off, this CD rocks! From the powerful opening track, ""Turns to Ashes"" to the quiet, emotional closing track ""Left Hand Charity"". And everything in between. Brock Lindow has a unique vocal style, reminds me ,at times, of late 70's punk like Sex Pistols combined with modern day metal like Blindside. Whatever it is, it works. You put it all together and you get 36 Crazyfists. Buy this CD!!! Favorite tracks include ""Two Months from a Year"", ""All I Am"", ""Eightminutesupsidedown"" and ""Turns to Ashes"". Not to take away from anything else on this CD though, just buy it."
5,My new favorite band!,"36 Crazyfists are awsome! i cant stop listening to their CD. at first i thought the lead singer's (Brock Lindow) style of singing was a bit odd, but after listening to it a bit, ive come to think its a lot better than anyone elses...I strongly suggest this CD for anyone who likes rock, and especially people that are looking for something out of the ordinary."
1,36 Crazyfists hit it big,This is one of the best bands I've heard in a long time. I love the way the way all the instruments and Brock's voice flows together. It's the perfect mix of Nu Metal and Modern Rock. Ceramic is one of my personal favorites with both sound perfectly intermixed.
3,A Little Worn For Wear - but decent,"Cheap feeling, shows bend lines easily, and could do with another slidable sheath to clamp extra belt length. BESIDES that, it's pretty good. Yes it shows some bends, but it hasn't broken or separated like similar material belts, even after a year and a half of hard use. The shininess of it stays attractive and disguises many of the bends at night. The series of holes makes it great for fitting, which I have trouble with on many belts, and makes it wearable anywhere from hips to waist. All in all, I would recommend it as a good cheap accessory (I have two) but not count on it for graceful longevity. It's exactly what you would expect, but it doesn't shine in any particular area either."
3,In a Class by Itself,"THE MAFU CAGE is one of the strangest films ever made with established actors. It really doesn't fit any category very well. Elements of horror and psychology are mixed with modern gothic melodrama to make a heady brew that has to be seen to be believed. Describing THE MAFU CAGE to others may make them laugh, but showing it to them will have another effect. As odd as it is, this film is compulsively watchable. The viewer is never certain what will happen next. It's always fascinating to watch well known actors involved in off-beat material, and this is one of the very best examples. It's unfortunate that the DVD transfer is somewhat murky and out of aspect ratio. But anyone interested should not be deterred by that."
4,A cult classic that was unexpectedly great!,"The Mafu Cage took me by surprise! I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. I bought this for cheap at a thrift shop and got it not expecting too much for it was cheap and looked like a sucky horror film. Boy was I surprised when i saw it! This old 70s film which is not yet on DVD, does not have a specific genre! At some parts its sad, sometimes funny, and other times it is very creepy! It is very perverse and bizare. When Carol Kane's character becomes insane from being dependent on her sister and is angry with the attention she is not given, this film becomes very frightening because of the consequenses! This is certainly a strange film that is extremely rare. Its very sad that this is not on DVD! Carol Kane's performance is outstanding as well as Lee Grant's.The Vhs is cheap so just buy bc its definately worth a look if you like horror, even though this is NOT A HORROR FILM, or if you like Dramas! Great movie****"
4,Great Product,"Install was very easy though the instructions could be better written. Would've been much quicker with two people but it's doable with one person. The bars look great! I didn't give 5 stars just because I haven't had them long enough to give that rating. So far so good.It's very key to keep the front/back bracket bolts loose until you get the bars bolted on. You'll need the give on each side to line up the bracket holes that feed the bolt that goes into the bars. Also, pay close attention to the bolts that you receive. It would've been much simpler if the manufacturer used the same size bolts. Took me a while to sort out what bolts went where and I still got it mixed up once. Thankfully I didn't mess up any threads."
3,Needs a little help,"We purchased this product so that we would have a way to organize or DVD's and also be able to use Media Center to play them in. The product has allowed us to do both, but there have been a few glitches that we are hoping there might be a software update that will fix some of the issues in the future.When we first tried to load the disks in we were only able to load about to load, the rest came up with errors. After several days we were able to load the remainder in. We have on occasion received errors that the device cannot read the DVD and we have to eject the DVD and reload."
2,A little disappointing.,I have a very large media library and I puchased this product to download all of my music. If the changer is filled (200 discs)some of them will not be downloaded. This happened all 5 times I have filled the changer. It is also not a very quick process. Had I known about the speed of the downloading I might not have opted to buy it. The one benefit is that it can download music while you are at work or asleep. It will probably work well for keeping media that some might wish to store and have easy access (movies or a small music collection). This product is not itunes friendly either. All media must be converted from wma files to apple media files.
4,Among his Very Best,"Don't let the ""quietness"" and ""laid back"" nature of this music fool you; there's a lot going on here. Wynton's playing here is blues based jazz at its best, and the supporting cast here is simply terrific. Production value is top notch, and the song selection is clever and the arrangements challenging.This is wonderfully accessible music that is clearly played by highly practiced and intelligent people, and its mood reflects the space artists can reach when they have done all of the necessary preparation. A feast for the ears and other senses, this is intelligent mood music (and I mean that in its very best sense) that can be appreciated in a practically unlimited number of ways."
5,Fabulous!,"I can't heap enough praise on this 5th installation in the Standard Time series: The Midnight Blues. The title had me anticipating something emotional and a little rougher hewn than the normally smooth selections turned out by Mr. Marsalis, and I was by no means disappointed.Wynton is by turns somber, playful and seductive on this CD. On ""Baby Won't You Please Come Home"" his trumpet emits an absolutely plaintive wail. This is the CD I play when I want to relax."
5,Good mix of a great musician's sound,"This cd has a great mixture of the greatest modern trumpet player and string instruments. These great musicians play great ballads, but if there was no Marsalis, there is no cd. Wynton is great, especially during his improvs."
5,Mellow Marsalis is real artistry,"Wynton Marsalis has to be among the greatest jazz artists of all time. He can jump with the best of them, roll back to the roots of Jazz and Blues, or bring us to tears with the sustained melodious tones we hear on this CD. I thought he had peaked with Volume 3 (performed with his equally talented father), but this may well have carried him beyond that outstanding performance. I admire Marsalis in deeper, more purified states of jazz, but here is where I enjoy listening to the soft, beautiful sounds that only he can pull out of a horn. It's as if gentle sexuality was what he was born to play."
2,"Wynton is great, but brass and strings don't go together","After buying and listening to Wynton's Standard Time Volumes 1-3, I was anxious to get Volume 5. I was not thrilled with the CD. Wynton is fantastic as always but the trumpet in my opinion did not go with the strings at all."
2,The Triumph of Technique,"It is all very well arranged and organised, and technically it is impeccable. But I miss life, creativity and plain old happiness of playing. Besides that, Mr Marsalis does not seem to have realized that putting 50 musicians in the string section does not make the music 50 times as good. I have the feeling that a lesser number would work better in this case."
2,STALE,"I am a huge Wynton Marsalis fan, but I must say this is the stalest album he has released. Maybe I am not fully realizing what Wynton was going for. His playing is as always superb, but the arrangements and the strings are just plain uninspired. Save your money and try ""Resolution to Romance,"" ""The Black Codes,"" ""Hot House Flowers,"" or ""Blood on the Fields."""
1,Marsalis Muzak: A real career low point;,"Wynton Marsalis with strings? This is not ""accessible"", it's schlock. The great man is floundering, and if you think that charge harsh, ask yourself: is this work much different from the music they pipe into elevators to soothe the passengers? Let's hope he regains his sense of style, taste, and innovation before we all fall asleep."
1,Too many typos and quite confusing,"Even for an advanced developer/architect this book does not make sense. There are too many typos, wrong references to Figures and Tables, and confusing diagrams. On the top of all these things, it is poorly written. For example (Verbatim from chapter 2):Figure -1 shows the five classes you'11 create in this chapter, they are HtmlInputDateRenderer,ProInputData,UIComponentTagSupport,and ProInputDateTag, as well as two you'11 be extending Renderer and UIInput.As you can tell from the above the author is quite confusing."
1,I'd recommend other books,"I bought this book based on a 5 star review and the title. Both topics have been something that I have been reading up on, and this seemed like a good marriage on both together. But I would instead recommend buying a good book on JSF, a good book on Ajax, and skipping this book altogether. Ajax in Action is a good Ajax book."
4,don't get a lot better,"honestly the only problem i had with this cd, was the fact that it did not have the hidden track found on the lp. other than that one missing song, i have never been less than thrilled to hear it again and again. a must for anyone who likes to think that modern punk rock isn't as hard or thought-provoking as ""them good old days"""
5,a beautiful photographic essay on a very talented architect,"beautiful photos and thoughtful text covering some of the work of, arguably, mexico's finest architect. this book does a excellent job of capturing the serene spirit of legoretta's work - having just returned from a week at his hotel in ixtapa, mexico, i can speak to the power, spirit and beauty of legoretta's work, and to the success with which this book conveys these feelings."
1,"Inhumane, Outdated, Improper","Dogs deserve humane treatment, and that is not what Mr. Milan's training gives them. Even aggression does not need to be treated with force and outdated training methods. Granted, the show is quite popular, but that doesn't mean the techniques are humane or should be done at home.The American Humane Association has written the following about his show:""The training tactics featured on Cesar Millan's `Dog Whisperer' program are inhumane, outdated and improper.""Another excerpt about the ""Dog Whisperer"" TV show: ""It also does a disservice to all the show's viewers by espousing an inaccurate message about what constitutes effective training and appropriate treatment of animals."""
5,"As usual, very well done!","I've followed the advise of Cesar for a few years and it has saved me from many potential problems. I'm a labrador lover and these gentle, smart and curious animals can test your patience but always give twice as much in love. Cesar is right on with animal behavior and pack mentality. I would recommend these tools to anyone of any experience level."
5,Quite helpful as a broad overview,"This set isn't an end-all for dog training nor a guarantee for a good working relationship with your dog. However, I got a lot out of this video as far as general attitude goes with dog ownership. The DVD on choosing a dog is also GREAT - I wish more people would watch that one before they went to get a dog! I absolutely put that one to use when I was going to shelters for months looking for a dog. There are so many 'cute' dogs; this DVD will help you pick the one that's right for you though. And I have to say: the dog I finally adopted (4 months later) is WONDERFUL! Our energy levels match perfectly, so my level of activity suits his exercise needs and he's content following me through my day-to-day and does so calmly and cooperatively. But again, and as Cesar will tell you: the DVD is NOT dog training. You still need to do regular obedience training in order to be a really competent and successful dog owner."
2,almost covers the most basic of information,"While I appreciate the psychological advice on just how to break the news of a dead parakeet to a family member, I really required more practical information - like what temperature is best for a healthy bird... or say... should I get a cuddle bone? The book does mention to keep your bird's cage out of direct sunlight (wouldn't the bird enjoy a little sun in the winter?) and to keep him out of drafts (in the summer wouldn't a nice breeze be appreciated?) I felt the book needed to concentrate more on actual facts instead of generalities & add more photos diagramming wing clipping & nail trimming."
1,For the Star,"Is Elvis Costello on some sort of strike or something? I think the last full album he released under his own name was ""All This Useless Beauty"" in 1996, and even that was a hodgepodge of older songs that he'd given away to other artists. Since then, it's been nothing but pure (did someone say pointless?) diletantism -- hangin' with Burt Bacharach, scoring Shakespeare productions, and now this highbrow monstrosity. Actually, ""For the Stars"" isn't really all that bad (in fact, the two new Costello-penned tunes that open and close the album are quite excellent), but I've docked it one star out of pure frustration, and another for the horrid lyric of ""Just a Curio"". Elvis: the supermarket tabloids and I are still sticking to our story that you are, in fact, still alive -- please don't make us look like idiots...."
1,Unrelenting melancholy,"After seeing A-SvA and EC on Charlie Rose, I was so anxious to have this CD that I went out and payed full price for it. I was prepared for what A-SvO termed ""nice melanchloly"". Instead, I find an album that is extremely limited in both its emotional and musical range. There is so little to distinguish one piece from another that, rather a satisfying melancholy, its unvarying expression is, I find, depressing. I've tried three times to listen to the whole album and I just can't. After the last time, I had to put on some Billie Holiday right away to get out of my funk. OF course, YMMV (your mileage may vary)."
1,Disappointing & confusing,I don't understand what Mr. Costello hears in this woman's voice. This cd is a real letdown from a man who is a real genius.
1,Please end this crossover craze right now !,"Iam talking to all of you who actually know who Von Otter is...Can you imagine her singing Schumann's ""Frauenlieben und Leben"" with a second-rate honky tonk piano player instead of the always perfect Bengt Forsberg?No, you can't.And then, how on earth can she be singing together with a guy (Costello) who, ... can not even keep a steady pitch?Let's face it, crossover has gone too far. While classical-trained critics still tear off lieder and opera albums because of a single misplaced breathe, the same singers go and record this type of thing with guys who can not even sing at the neighborhood church. And we are supposed to smile and accept it in the name of open mindedness.So what's next? June Anderson with Steven Tyler? Bryn Terfel with Kelly Clarkson? Angela Georghiou with Eminem? I just can't wait to hear the next crossover sensation!"
5,I LOVE this CD!,"Finally, an opera singer who knows how to channel her Classical training into a sound that is, as one critic aptly described it, ""what pop singers would sound like if they could actually sing""! Although Elvis Costello does not join Ms. von Otter very often in the vocals, when he does they harmonize beautifully. With great melodies (some beautiful, some catchy) and sensitive (but not sappy) lyrics, this album makes a fine addition to any CD collection."
5,Another stunner from Elvis,"If you enjoyed the Costello/Bachrach collaboration, you're in for another treat (if you haven't progressed along with Elvis in the past few years, forget it). This is a gorgeous album, full of stunning interpretations of contemporary pop songs. I love ""Don't Talk..."" ""The Other Woman"" and ""Baby Plays Around""--I could listen to them -- heck, I am listening to them -- over and over."
1,"what's so funny about peace, love, and understanding?","Nothing's funny about this boring duo. I picked this up FREE at my library and it didn't take me too many tracks to see why it was donated. The musical arrangements are hapless and dull, and her voice is Dion without the Vegas power finale. Come to think of it, the lyrics remind me of Dion; they are as saccharine as anything Dion has ever sung. I wasted a blank CD on this limp, sleepy pairing of two otherwise good artists."
2,DISAPOINTING,"I AM IN AGREEMENT THAT ANNE SOFIE VON OTTER HAS A LOVELY VOICE, BUT HER TONE KEPT ME FEELING SHE WOULD BREAK OUT INTO ""PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON"" DURING ANY OF THE SONGS. CUT 14 WAS NICE, BUT OF COURSE ELVIS' CONTRIBUTION, VOCALLY, ROUNDED IT OUT FOR ME.. WE ALL KNOW HE IS A WONDERFUL SONGWRITER BUT TRUE ELVIS FANS NEED TO HEAR HIS DULCIMER TONES SINGING HIS SOULFUL WORDS."
3,Vanilla Pudding,"The latest in the line of Elvis's increasingly prolific high-brow collaborations, For the Stars is pleasant; yet a little bland.His previous collaborations were pure genius. His recordings with the Brodsky Quartet and Burt Bacharach had a unifying mood. The Juliet Letters was clever, playful, and melodic. Painted from Memory was as angst-ridden and anthemic as pop could ever be.Overall the album is technically superior. The musicianship is excellent and the arrangements of the cover songs are fitting tributes (especially the beautiful renditions of two obscure songs from Brian Wilson's masterpiece, Pet Sounds).However, the collection seems soulless. Don't know exactly why -perhaps it is Mrs. Von Otter's classically trained voice or the lack of Elvis's singing for most of the album.But it is a worthy effort - just not one of my favorites."
3,A skilled voice sings heartbreaking lyrics,"Lately Elvis Costello has composed midnight melacholy tunes. His collaboration with Burt Bacharach, succesfully transformed the scowly young man from ""This Year's Model"" and ""Punch the Clock"" into a poet of failed relationships. Ms. Von Otter is the perfect vehicle for Costello's apparent despairing heart. However, at times this album turns a bit monotonous."
2,Better Than Sominex,"Costello and von Otter separately are marvelous artists, but together they've come up with what I can only describe as a snorefest. The arrangements are languid to say the least, each one more sleep-inducing than the next. Mellow is one thing, but this is ridiculous! Perhaps the material just isn't to my liking; most of the songs have the bubble-gummy sound of The Carpenters B-sides. A valiant effort, but von Otter is just one more classical artist who should stick to her day job and avoid crossing over."
3,Easy music for my ear!!!,"Well, I donot want to say this CD is stunning or somthing like that. Von otter is a good singer and her pop tune is quite natural and much better than typical opera singers( ex, Jesse Norman or Kiri..). Personally, I was more impressed with Sumi Jo's pop tune with her new CD ""ONLY LOVE"". However, ""ONLY LOVE"" CD covers only broadway musics not Jazz tune. In terms of music itself on this new CD(For the stars), when it is compared with ""I was born in love with you ""CD by Jessye Norman, Von Otter's CD is much weaker. I do love Jessye Norman's crossover CD very much except her singing(weak voice as a jazz singer). Well, it seems that it is not that clear to choose clean winner. In fact, I wish Costello had covered more variety of music in his new CD. Anyhow, if you like easy music with a litte Jazz flavor, this new CD will not disappoint you very much. But if you are real Jazz fan, you might need to listen this CD before you buy."
1,No life in her (pop) art,"I am a big fan of both artists and wanted very much for this combination to work. It avoids the traditional trap of ""oversinging"" the pop material. But a few years after its release, in these American Idol era, is that really such a terror for pop music any more? So-called oversinging seems pretty popular these days!The big problem is that von Otter has not found a way to communicate any emotion in this scaled-down form of singing. All her classical techniques are stripped away, and there's nothing to replace them. Sure, her voice is gorgeous, but it sounds exactly the same no matter what the lyrical content. The songs could have been made up of nonsense syllables for all the emotional life she communicates.Deeply disappointing - but someone, somewhere, will figure out how to bring classically trained singers to the wonderful pop song repertoire that has been composed over the past 50 years. Elvis may very well be the person to do it, but not on this album."
1,Get out your insulin,"Elvis Costello should of course be allowed to advance into old age with whatever tastes his rapidly mellowing gray matter generates. However, I'm not sure why they should be inflicted on the buying public, except that this is the bland rubbish they are apparently willing to buy. Horrible, contrived, like watching an old Donny and Marie variety show from the 70s."
4,Better than most opera-pop,"Von Otter sings nicer opera-star-does-semipop than many of her colleagues (e.g. Peter Hoffmann) have. She employs less theatrical schmaltz, does less volume-is-quality showing-off, and is only annoying when she employs arpeggio where some straight singing would be better.The selection of songs is fantastic, the production is flawless, and even Elvis, the former pub rocker who now sounds like your uncle in the bathtub, kind of fits in.Not hip, but a pleasant CD for quiet, contemplative hours, when Von Otter's crystal-clear voice has an eerily soothing quality."
3,"Technical Polish, Emotional Mildness","Costello has ""bridged the gaps"" between various genres with varying success. This effort is a pleasant excursion that might be stronger with more emotional investment from the polished and tasteful, but overly mannered Von Otter. When you're singing songs about infidelity and crumbling relationships it helps to sing as though one is an emotionally penetrated. Ironically, Costello who is a sometimes strained singer,is a relief, adding just the right amount of emotional punch to keep things moving. The strongest song is the dreamy title track, followed by the wistful ""Just A Curio"" and solid covers of ""Don't Talk"" and ""This House Is Empty Now"". I'm curious to see if a follow up is in the works."
2,Really Soft!,"I bought this because of John Wilson's performance on ""Across the Sea"" and it's totally different. I expected big band swing and got elevator music."
3,eh.. keep looking,"JUST SO YOU KNOW.. THE PHOTO SHOWS IT HOLDING A CAR KEY. THIS IS SOMEWHAT DECIEVING. THE HOLDER REALLY ONLY FITS SMALL KEYS, THAT CAR KEY MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SMALL. IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF AUTO LOCKING OR UNLOCKING ON YOUR KEY THAT SOMEWHAT BULKS IT UP THEN I RECOMMEND YOU KEEP LOOKING."
4,Holds tight,Was leary of the magnet strength but it is holding well. Bumps and all and it stays in place. More concerned about the latch cover holding tight.....another use for duct tape.
5,Glad I got it,"This little thing holds my '99 Ford truck key as well as a small key for the bed topper. It's sturdy, waterproof, and holds very fast to the metal of the truck with a magnet. If you're looking to attach it to a plastic/fiberglass/polymer bumper it comes with a small metal plate that you can adhere to the car and then attach the case to. I've had it for 5 months, driven 5000 miles up mountain, over deserts, through fields and it hasn't so much as shifted an inch nor popped open. Even if it did pop open a little, the keys are held in place by a elastic band. I've used it twice to get into the truck when I've misplaced my key and I can imagine it'll come in handy if I ever need to leave the truck someplace for a friend to pick up."
5,A Great Inspiration,"This CD may not be the most popular one in a store. However, I give it two thums up!I am not that much of a fan for Religious music, but this one has a special tone and a special message, that I think everyone should lisen to.I find the music to be very inspirational and thought provoking.Give it a try and see what you think."
2,"Nice enough foil, but. . .","Although it is a nice blade, and have no complaints about the product itself, I ordered two and only received one, and was still billed for two. Now I am going to have to order an additional foil elsewhere, and I need them very soon. Very disappointing. I doubt I will do business with this company again."
4,Monkeys are Awesome,"My sister bought this game for me because she knows how much I love monkeys. It was a lot of fun. My boyfriend and I played it the other night for the first time and we were hooked. At first, trying to get the monkeys on the tree took some practice, but you soon get the hang of it. I would recommend it not only for kids but adults will enjoy it as well."
4,Fun for even little tikes,My mom has this game for the grandkids and when she played it with my 2 year old he was hooked. It takes a little practice to get the monkeys in the tree but even if the kids push too hard it is fun for them to see the monkey fly through the air. Teaches 4 colors and also counting (they can count the number of bananas they get for getting a monkey in the tree). Is also a fun game for adults if playing by the instructions! Will by buying additional games for my son and his friends.
5,Jumping Monkeys rock,"My three year old is nuts over monkeys and loves this game. We bought one at a yard sale and it was missing pieces. He was so upset that we were missing pieces, we had to get a new game. While he is having fun flipping monkeys, he is also learning the coordination. This is a great game for the money!!"
5,This Game Is Awesome,"As a kid, I loved this one. It was so fun springing the monkeys all over the tree. I am pleased to see it still for sale after all these years, and for so cheap. Great for both kids and adults."
4,Had fun!,"We got this for a four-year old. He had a blast shooting the monkeys. He doesn't exactly follow game rules yet, but it was fun anyway; we laughed a lot."
3,Fun but Too Difficult,"For the price, this is a good game. The kids have had a lot of fun with this game. However, it's virtually impossible to ""win."" It doesn't feel like anyone, even an adult at close range, can actually get the monkeys to hang and stay hanging long enough to get all four onto the tree. To win multiple rounds as the instructions outline would take HOURS. Never the less, my five and three year-old both enjoy the game. The tire of it within ten minutes, but they have fun. As you'd expect, the monkeys fly everywhere, so you have to stop the fun periodically to find the missing monkeys."
4,Little kids love it,"There is some skill involved in catapulting a little monkey onto the ""tree"", but the kids (I'd say six and under) seem to just love that they're making the monkeys fly, for the same reason they like Angry Birds!Unfortunately, the small pieces mean this isn't a toy to keep around the three-and-under crowd, and because the monkeys go flying, they (and also the bananas) can easily disappear. The monkeys are also breakable if stepped on. You may quickly have to change the house rules as to how many monkeys each player gets, and how many bananas it takes to win :)"
2,pegs are too small,"I purchased this game for my teenage daughters because we liked the game. This version is EXTREMELY small, it is difficult to hold and put the pegs in the proper place. If I had known the actual size I would have gotten the larger version. Even too small for travel."
3,Not the portable version I was used to...,Not necessary a bad game; actually the game itself is as good as it was 30 years ago but the quality of this version is quiet low. The pegs are made of cheap plastic. The box instead to slide open flip sideways; for a kid is a sure way to drop all the pegs all over! If the old version exits somewhere look for it; this one is really not a best of.
5,great travel game,"great travel game, took it on vacation to the beach. all the kids were fighting to play. good, smart fun"
4,Dandy Swedish Power Pop,"A very fun, energetic power pop album that has more power than most. Several excellent songs (""Young and Stupid"" is probably my favorite right now) made this a purchase well worth the money. A little bit of new-wave synth, some grungy wall-of-noise guitar, sharp vocals and harmonies, and some very catchy tunes."
4,Great Swedish pop rock!,"This Perfect Day have really outdone themselves with this album. The production is reminescent of the Cars with the power of...well, of This Perfect Day."
5,Bach Flower Remedies Really Work!,"I have been using the Bach Flower Remedies for years. They really do work when you are dealing with mental, emotional, and personality issues. Get a good book on the subject and then make your own combo remedy bottles and see for yourself. Also, this is a great price for the Bachs."
2,"Not food grade, messy","This product came in a big paper carton with a plastic bag wrapped around it. Not condusive to keeping clean at all, and there was powder all over the bag. Upon more research I realized it was not food grade quality, and there was no real way to spread it around without getting it all over yourself. I recommend the little shaker food grade ones which are 100 percent as opposed to this 85 percent stuff. And be careful, if you get this stuff on you it makes your hands feel so dry no lotion will work on them for days....imagine what they do to your lungs...."
1,Not working...,"I applied this product to the ant mounds in my yard 4 days ago and the ants are still alive. Short of trying to buy an anteater, what can I do to kill these pesky ants (I've used chemicals, even doused with gaseline, and now this doesn't work)?"
5,An Absolutely Fabulous Novel,"This novel kept me up until 3:30 AM because I just could not bear to put it down. It is an incredible story of secrets, cultures, love, and the ties that bind. It was a wonderful detailed account of an Iranian-American girl, her brother, and their parents and of their challenges as they lived through the revolution and their flight to America (and the new challenges that were presented there). A fabulous read! I can't wait to start reading Nahid Rachlin's other novels."
4,Great Little Movie,"A little heavy for a rom-com but really great little movie about the true meaning of relationships and risks in ""putting it all out there."" the two actors who played the leads ""Adam"" and ""Seta"" where fantastic as well as the other supporting characters. Also, being from MA I had heard of playwright Israel Horovitz but had never seen him act - he's great in this! Again, don't expect something especially light-hearted, but if you want a movie that tackles some really serious issues with maturity of what it means to be in a relationship - I high recommend you check out."
5,An eloquent commentary on all things political and sexual,Fat Wreck Chords have really outdone themselves here.As an avid punker myself I was glad to see some of my favourite bands at their best and some new talents.Punk rock is being sapped by mainstream but it is nice to see we can still belt out a few damn good tunes.I have only hope for more cds like this one.It certainly has pride of place in my collection.
5,Awsone Fat Whreck Chords punk,"This is by far the best cd compilation I own, all the bands are from Fat Whreck Chords, and everysong is awsome, I was given this cd by a friend and she didnt want it, but why not man?! this cd kicks ass, NOFX's older years, hi standards awsome, all the bands rule! Lagwagon is awsome to, BUY THIS CD MAN"
4,Fat is good.,"Good collection. Remake of ""California Dreamin'"" not as good as I'd hoped it be (really like the original Momma's and Poppa's) but ""Country Roads"" just kicks it. Thinking of buying stock in Fat Wreck Chords."
5,Punk Rock Greatness!,"If you love melodic punk rock, get this CD! All the songs on this compilation are great! This CD is over 5 years old though, so these songs have been out a while. Chances are you've heard them on the full length CDs from each band on here. There are a few exclusives though. Check out the song ""Vincent"" by NOFX...probably my all time favorite NOFX song!"
2,The Band didnt even like this one,"If there is one thing that is known, is that Deicide usually comes through with some insane musical effort, and that is one what makes them an elite group on the death metal genre. Dont get me wrong, this isnt a complete disaster, but its pretty close, with repitive songs, with almost none of the guitar work or drumming that the band is known for. Deicide was on its last nerve with Roadrunner Records, so they rushed the final two albums in the roadrunner catalog. They said that they were very disapointed with the last two roadrunner releases, and if you listen to this you can see why. The one track that really stands out is ""Worry in the House of Thieves"" which is the best song on this album. The title track is also very good, and the rest is just vanilla death metal, that falls short of average. If you want, go ahead and give it a try if you want to add this to your catalog, but I doubt it will be spinning in your CD player very long."
3,Deicide's Rush to Escape Roadrunner Records,"Obviously, if you despise your record label and are obligated to publish one more CD under their brand, you are gonna rush something out the door as Deicide did with this CD. I think I am on the same page as most Deicide fans when I say that this is their worst offering. That doesn't mean that it is bad or that I dislike it, because there is still a lot of good stuff on this CD. It is just that it feels rushed and pushed out the door. There isn't a lot of heart behind this CD and it shows. Heck, even Glen and company don't like the album and rarely play any songs from it. With all this said, it is still Deicide and even when they don't try, they still know how to make death metal. This CD delivers in that department, just don't expect it to be your top choice for nightly listening material."
4,their worst one... but still good!,"Personally I don't like this one out of all the Deicide CDs I own (and I own em all). But, this one has one of my fave. Deicide songs on it- Vengeance will be Mine. This song is just... awesome... a nice catchiness that keeps me comming back to it, and I always recommend it to people who are getting into the band. The rest of the album is all right... sounds all the same after a while... but then again all music does in a way. This album is just... good... not great, not terrible... but just good. If you liked Insinerathym (sorry if I mispelled) then you'll enjoy this... same deep growls and good solos. Again... a note about those complain about lyrical content... come on... it's Deicide... means kill God... end of story. You should know what to expect."
3,"Not bad, could've beed better...","I saw this album sitting at the music store and i thought, ""a new Deicide album, must be good."" So i bought it and i put it in the cd player. I thought the first song ""In Torment in Hell"" kicked ass. The next 2 songs are still good but then i personally think the rest are not good. The production is surprisingly good for a 4 day recording and mixing, but it makes the guitaris sound more brutal. I like the way it is produced, as another reviewer said band need to stop worrying on production. This album is not that bad of an album and is for the true Deicide fans only. If you are new to death metal or Deicide buy either ""Deicde"" or ""Legion"" first, those are 2 great examples of what Deicide was all about before they started to suck more and more. Even ""Amon: Feasting the Beast"" is better than this album, so do yourslef a favor and buy the other ones first before buying this, you will do yourself a favor."
4,In Torment In Hell,"""In Torment In Hell"" is in my opinion one of Deicide's greatest offerings yet. There is not one bad song on this album, but the only problem that I do have with it is that the band at times seem like they are playing at slower tempos. Deicide drummer Steve does a hell of a drum performance on the song ""Let It Be Done"" which in my opinion is the heaviest best track on here followed by ""Worry In the House of Thieves"". ""In Torment In Hell"" is another one of those death metal albums that is just really fun to listen to. I would recommend ""In Torment In Hell"" for anyone that is just getting into death metal."
1,More microwave Deicide.,"If you thought Insineratehymn was great, there is a small chance you will like this, but otherwise, avoid. Cliche becomes the foundations of the adapted Deicide style since it is apparent to all that the band no longer enjoy or care about what they are doing. Play this album for most death metal listeners and they'll think it's a parody of the genre until you tell them it's Deicide. Then they will simply be, as is this reviewer, disappointed."
1,wait.....this is Deicide????,"I was in torment in my car listening to this piece of junk. Darkness radiates off of Lord Benton as his vocals sound as brutal and flat out amazing as ever, but that's where the good stuff ends. The music on this ""Deicide"" cd is horrible. Do yourself a favor Deicide fans, and potential Deicide fans for that matter, listen to a real Deicide cd. Pick up Once Upon the Cross, put that in your cd player, and hear what the exalted Deicide should sound like. I don't know what these guys above me are listening to....but trust me, this cd is NOT good."
3,Meh...,"Deicide is still my one if favorite bands. This album is not like Once upon the cross, but then again isnt supposed to be. bands are allowed to change, as long as they stay true to their roots there is no reason for people to complain. This is a different deicide cd, accept it, stop comparing it to their earlier stuff. This album really isnt all that bad if you stop comparing it. It's heavy, its satanic, i dont know why very few people like it. Just go buy it and dont compare it to their first three albums, i swear you wont think this is crap."
3,Leaves much to be desired....,"Deicide - Satanic Death Metal(usually) at its best. This album was very much of a dissapointment. Very few solos; when they were there, they were pretty short and boring. The lyrics on this cd weren't very bad (nothing wrong with the theme, they just seem that Glen Benton has run out of ideas), a bit boring. The guitars weren't too fast (at Deicide's standard, that is) either. Heavy? I suppose....but Deicide have been much heavier in the past. The drumming is a tad repetitive: I think this is perhaps the only cd that Steve hasn't shined through, although it's still pretty good as always. In Torment In Hell has its moments, but is essentially a miss for Deicide, this is the real dud in the catalogue. The music is just plain annoying. Once Upon the Cross and Legion are the best Deicide cds."
2,This Is A Joke...Right?,"Deicide has definitely been a favorite band of mine since I heard their self titled debut, albums like 'Legion' and 'Once Upon the Cross' only strengthened that feeling...but, like a lot of fans, when 'Serpents of the Light' was released we were devastated because of how boring it was, then Deicide got us back with 'Insineratehymn', but with their final record for Roadrunner Records, they have again taken a step back...a gigantic step back. What in the he ll has happened? The album is a barely alvagable and weak attempt at death metal greatness, instead of trying out some new material, they just rehash the disaster that was 'Serpents of the Light'. With extremely shoddy musicianship and downtuned vocals (the worst Glen Benton has ever done)....this will be finished at a later time..."
2,Not Good at All,"This sounded like their career was ending, but I think they were actualy saving all the good stuff for the next album Scars of the Crucifix, which I think happens to be their best release."
3,Disappointing,"Deicide has lost it's glory. Not all of it, since there are still some great songs on this album (my personal fav is Let It Be Done) but the rest is just too average. Which is the best word for this and which is the reason I gave this three stars. Although the old Deicide albums (the first one especially, which is my fav death metal album of all time) are absolutely classics and far above the average, this is just bad. It lacks progression, originality (also for the voice, Benton had a cool voice, now it's mostly plain grunting), and good songs."
5,True norwegian black metal!,"This is a killer album! I haven't heard that much Darkthrone, but this album is definetly a classic. The norwegian songs are the best, but I must say that Quintessence(written by Varg Vikernes) is one of the best black metal songs i've ever heard. What makes Darkthrone so great, in my opinion, is the powerful voice of Nocturno Culto. He sounds so evil and raging, almost sounds like puking when he shrieks. The lyrics by Fenriz is also extremly good, especially the patriotic ""Sn og Granskog."" It is a very enjoyable outro with lyrics that norwegian people really can relate to. I think i'm gonna go and listen to it right now."
4,A glacier of ice and fire,"While a couple of the songs could have been released on Transylvanian Hunger and are blast beat fast, Darkthrone slowed the tempo way down to a sludgecore grind (think Procreation of the Wicked by Celtic Frost) And it works. Full sounding, yet still necro, Panzerfaust is a ugly, angry listen. The last track is an electronic ambient work with vocals and percussion. Panzerfaust is one of Darkthrone's best works (behind A Blaze... and Transylvanian Hunger) and is well worth getting, as are all of their works previous to this one. On a side note check out their new album Sardonic Wrath which is the best thing they've done since Transylvanian Hunger."
2,"OK, but not great","The calorie to protein ratio for these bars in general are great. I've done the chocolate and peanut butter and smores ones, and they are all pretty good. These, however, are definitely at the bottom in terms of flavor. At least they are a break from chocolate, but IMO this is kind of chemical-y in taste."
1,awful,"these bars arrive smashed, melting and stale..taste like cardboard with, dried blueberrie jam spread around on them...awful"
3,The Kabala of Numbers,"As opposed to being a strict Kabalarian interpretation of Numbers, this book takes a broad perspective on multiple Occult subjects. Due to a long-standing passion for the study of Numerology, I found some areas instructive but in summation, it simply was not as compelling as I had hoped. Nor did this text represent any of the current views I have been exposed to on Kablarian Numerology.Would I recommend it to anyone attempting to further their studies? No!"
3,I beg to differ...,"Well, i used this book for my History and Systems of Psyc class and i found it to be extremely boring and drawn-out. It just seemed like everything in it, i had heard about before, but the book managed to make it even more boring than the first time i heard about the research! I fully understand that, yes, it is a history book, but i guess i thought that there would be more to it, seeing as how it's a psyc book. Then again, it was my last semester and nothing i read that semester truly satisfied me, so it could just be me! It wasn't completely terrible, but it could've stood for improvement! Then again, if you are reading this review, you are most likely buying this for a class, and don't have much of a choice over what you'll be reading anyway! Enjoy!"
5,supringly complete,"I was very surprised by the wholeness of this book. Easy to follow and covers basic to Afghan/Tunisian. This is a good book for beginners to intermediates. Too easy for advanced. I'm beginner-Intermediate, so I got a lot out of this book. This is a great starter book, good if you just started crocheting and all the online patterns have started to bore you from their repetition. It is a start to making your own patterns and coolness !!!"
2,White Elephant or Sacred Cow?: Take Your Pick,This is the book that has gathered together all the most annoying people in science studies -- especially the ones who flog the dead horse of 'practise'without considering the larger social and political contexts that have made the Science Wars such a hot issue. I would advise so-called Science Warriors looking for an easy target to look no further than this arboreal sacrifice. Everyone else: check out David Hess's introduction to science studies for something more reasonable and Steve Fuller's book on Kuhn for something really challenging.
1,It's Not Football!,The green and Yellow Cover suggests it's about a not very good football club from England. Chirp Chirp. I couldn't find any football in it at all - this was dosappointing!
5,Take a journey back in time......,"Being involved in the modern day south Georgia legal system and a one-time resident of Lowndes County, I thoroughly enjoyed this very detailed and well-written novel. The author's attention to the details of the trial and testimony is very exact, but the narrative flows almost like a suspenseful thriller. It is obvious the author spent a great deal of time talking to people about the background of the feud, as well as absorbing the tremendous amount of written material on the case and aftermath. Even 100 years later, this book puts you on the bustling streets of downtown Valdosta during the frantic days of the trials as if you were a spectator yourself. I highly recommend this novel."
5,Excellent title for an excellent book!,I could not put this book down! I grew up in Coffee County and knew some of the descendants of the people in the book. One of them was my school bus driver! Very well written story of children and their obedience to their father.
5,WOW! Great book!,"I really enjoyed this book! I couldn't put it down - I read it in 2 days. TRUE CRIME is my reading of choice but to have it take place so close to my hometown of Douglas is unusual! I live about 20 miles from the burial place of most of the people in this book. This book is really entertaining for history buffs wanting to know what life was like in turn-of-the-century rural Georgia including Coffee County and Lowndes County. Back then trials were the biggest source of entertainment available. The book mostly takes place in Jacksonville, Broxton, Ambrose, Hahira, and Valdosta, Georgia. REALLY INTERESTING READING!"
1,cheap,"cheap fabric. not worth what they are selling it for. worth about 5 bucks, tops. junk. i sent it back."
5,Classic and comfortable,"I like this sweater because the design is versatile--it blends with many of my outfits. The feminine stitching adds an elegant touch. The sleeves fit just right, tapering down to fit comfortably at the wrists. The quality in craftsmanship and materials ensure that I will be able to wear this sweater for a long time."
2,Not what I expected,"This sweater is much thinner then I expected. The photo shown to advertise it looks like the sweater is pretty thick or at least medium. When I got it, it was very thin & even looked stretched, the front design was very open. In the picture it looks like the design is stitched tight and therefore well made but the one delivered to me wasn't. Also, the arms are way too long. I ordered size Medium knowing the length of the sweater is kind of long, that's ok but when the sleeves are way too long, then it's not practical. No wonder the women in the picture has one arm held up and the other in her pants pocket.I have ordered before from National & it was all good, but not this time."
2,DOA,"This flashlight was DOA. I thought the supplied batteries might have been dead but eventually determined it was a faulty battery cage. I used the cage from a similar flashlight with other issues and it is now working. I tested that battery cage in several other flashlights with no success. These are cheap lights that are finicky but sometimes you get a good one that lasts and works well. I like them for their compact size, brightness and battery life. Automotive stores and places like home depot have these for cheaper sometimes and i buy several at a time for many locations like cellar, garage, toolbox, office and glovebox."
2,Great Looks-Bad Execution,"I don't have any complaints about the look and feel of this torch. Its far better than any available in my country at the moment. The light is superb- more than you could expect from a torch its size. However- and that's a However with a capital H- there is something wrong with the switch. Every now and then the light starts flickering and you have to bang the torch against some surface repeatedly to get it to work. That's really frustrating and embarrassing if you have company. If the company fixes this flaw-and I guess it has to do with the circuitry inside- the torch will get a 5 star rating from most reviewers, I believe. So I would say, for now, Don't Buy unless the company fixes the problem stated above."
2,Bang for buck,"An OK little light. 4 stars is relative to price, if you want a real flashlight you will have to pay 15 bucks or more.Very bright, simple, small, flimsy, and worth the $4.13 i paid, and it came with batteries.I did notice some mild ""flickering"". But realized it is caused from the LEDs seem to be mounted very loosly to the flashlight (almost like they are attached to springs) so that any small movement/shaking of the flashlight is amplified by the LEDs that shake. (kind of what you would expect for 4 bucks delivered with batteries).UPDATEChanged my review to a 2. flashlight broke, but not until after one camping trip and the NYC blackout. Seems the loose connections in LEDS were far worse than i thought."
1,Does not work!,I ordered two of these in different colors. One of them works great but the other does not work so I cannot give it any more than one star. I will have to go through the hassle of returning it now. I made sure the batteries were in correctly and that the assembly was correctly installed. I also tried my own batteries and still no success.
1,A Flashlight That Doesn't Light,"Do not buy this product. It is impossible to align the battery cradle that fits inside the flashlight for a stable electrical connection. As you tighten the flashlight's end cap to hold the battery cradle in place, it rotates the cradle, breaking the connection to the internal contact, and turning the light off. Absolutely ridiculous. One star for cute though useless."
2,"Doesn't stay on, have to tap to get working","Maybe i got a defective unit but after about a year the light stopped staying on constantly. I have to tap it's head until the light comes on, but of course since I have to tap it often it typically taps itself right back off. After 3 years its relegated to last ditch emergency (or laziness) use, I moan and groan and pull it out and soon as I'm done with it throw it in the desk drawer as far back as I can and hope I'll not be so lazy and get up to grab myFenix 6 Level High Performance Cree LED Flashlight, Black, 4-Inch"
1,Dead after 4 months,"This died on me after four months of extremely light use. Batteries test fine, my guess is it's the on-off switch. As inexpensive as it is, it's not worth anything if it doesn't light up..."
1,use less flashlight,I looked everywhere for the size of the product. I thought it said 7 inches. When it arrived I was very surprised at this tiny useless item. After reading a review that quoted the warning on the product. I'm more upset that Amazon would sell something that could harm people.
3,How to fix Flickering Issue,"Very nice looking little flashlight for the price. However, as other reviewers have stated, the light tends to flicker / go out at times, only to be curred by rescrewing the battery cover. I perminantly fixed the problem by scuffing the threads on the cap so that they would ground better to the flashlight case. Now the flashlight works great."
5,Such a bright little light!!,This little light really packs a punch for its size. I need to order more!
1,Warning- beware,"I had ordered 3 of these for a camping trip and found them to be great. However, after ordering 20 to give out for my child's birthday party, we read the package warning on the back.Here is it exactly:WARNING:Always wear ANSI approved safety goggles when using this product. Before using this product, the user should read the operating instructions to understand everything about this product. Normal everyday use of this product is likely to expose the user to dust and microscopic particles containing lead and other chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm. Always wear the appropriate clothing and safety equipment when operating this product. Wash hand thoroughly after the use and handling of this product.That last line is what really made our decision. When was the last time you had to think about wearing safety goggles and washing your hands after using a flashlight?"
1,Not that great,I bought 3 of them and all of the flashlights have fallen apart from riding around in my car. One of the them the front plastic fell out and so did the bulbs. The other two you have to screw the back off a little bit to get them to light up at all. I would rather stick with my mag lite.
1,They are CHEAP for a reason,"At first I thought it was a great light, very bright, and well made. Until a day or two after having it, it starting switching itself off and shining in and out - instead of having a steady beam of light."
2,Unintentional strobe.,"These lights have inter power delivery issues. I have three of these lights and every one of them goes dim, flickers constantly. You can try and shake it and bang it to make it work right to seldom avail."
4,Neiko Super Bright 9 LED,It is great for kids...bought for a camping tripNeiko Super Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Cool Blueand it worked great.
1,I hoped they would be better,"I purchased two of these flashlights for my young children. I was looking for a LED flashlight that had a push button on/off switch and didn't easily open. These flashlights were exactly what I was looking for, however, one of them broke almost immediately and the other only works if you shake it. Now I only have one flashlight that sometimes works and my children fight over who gets it. I wish I never bought them."
2,Poor Poor build quality,"I bought these for relative's kids. They liked it. It was good deal. Totally i bought 10 of Black and Blue. Blue is better looking than Black.But this product is just made in China quality. It doesn't last long! Just for one time use.in this build quality, $2-3 is proper deal."
3,OK considering price,"I was disappointed in the flashlight beam. It is not as bright as I expected for 9 LED bulbs and the beam is very broad. However, for the price it is OK and seems well constructed. It is a minor point but I prefer products where the manufacturer proudly displays their logo. On this flashlight there is nothing. I feel the flashlight is fairly priced but personally would have been willing to pay a bit more for flashlight with a brighter, focused beam."
2,You get what you pay for.,After a couple of weeks it does not stay on. When it worked the lights were very bright. Only reason I give it 2 stars is because it worked for 2 weeks and it was cheap.
4,great price and brite flashlight,"The flash light appearance is very appealing and it has nice fit and finish. It is very bright and illuminates well up to about 15 yards but the beam is too broad for bright light further than 15 yards. Every once in a while I have had to tap the light or adjust the rear of the flashlight where the batteries are installed because the light stops shinning. But, successfully the light has come on each time. Overall, I recommend the flashlight for simple jobs at close ranges."
1,DOA right out of the sealed box,"No amount of tweaking, re-setting the batteries, re-adjusting the battery cap could breath the life into this thing. It arrived in a sealed package...totally dead.It was only $5, but they could be better spent on lunch. My advice - keep looking, if you don't want to become a statistic..."
3,Ok flashlight once you get it to work,"This is a small flashlight, maybe three inches. I only gave it a three because I had to install and remove the batteries several times until I could get the flashlight to turn on when the cap was all the way screwed on. Also the hand strap did not fit through the hole provided. It is a good size to keep in the glove compartment of your car."
2,Not worth the price,"Flashlight switches between bright and not so bright on it's own. Give it a whack and it restores the connection. It has not been used hard. Strictly indoors on a desk.What is amazing is how LITTLE light all those led's manage to give off. I've got a, admittedly pricier, flashlight with one led that gives a couple of orders of magnitude more light than this Neiko. It's just absurd when the descrption talks about the ""flood of light' that this thing supposedly gives off."
2,Worked for 3 months,Bought this in December. Stopped working in March. But I guess it was only a couple dollars so what could I really expect? Still ended up being a waste of money.
3,"Good product, questionable quality","They are small and bright, but sometimes have trouble with consistent beam which tends to flicker."
3,"Bought 4, only 3 worked.","I bought 4 of these as ""stocking stuffers"" for my daughters, my wife, and myself. I wanted them to have one in their car for safety reasons. Well, my one daughter's did not work. I tried fooling with the electronic connections, but I could not get it to work without shaking, and then just picking it up would make it stop working. I wound up throwing it out because I had been tampering with the electronics to try and get it to work. I wound up getting a replacement at K-Mart.For the 3 that did work, they work beautifully, are very bright, and are very light and compact."
5,Great little light,"This flashlight is very light weight and easy to carry in a purse to have handy at any time. It puts out a reasonable amount of light for such a small tool. We have purchased about ten of them and have stashed them all over the place for quick access. It doesn't seem to be affected by constant abuse in a purse or at the hands of our kids who also have them in their rooms. I would definately recommend this low priced, high quaility tool to my friends."
2,Very prone to flickering--requires frequent adjustments to work properly.,"Having purchased just one of these, I can't pretend my experience is representative, so for what it's worth--a handy, colorful, bright light while it works. After a week, mine started oscillating: bright/dim/bright/dim. I fed it 3 fresh new Energizer alkalines, which put it in a different phase: dim/bright/dim/bright. The problem with this little light is the unstable, inconsistent contact. Once any of the springs (4 altogether) loosens up the least bit, the light makes enough contact with the surface area to ""work"" but not with a consistently high beam. The solution, at least a temporary one, is to pry all 4 springs out just enough to insure adequate tension when you reinstall the 3-spring battery holder and the light itself. That should insure a non-flickering light until the process needs to be repeated, though it's unlikely the springs will permit this sort of readjusting indefinitely."
4,Small and bright,"Although I haven't used these little flashlights much I know that they work. They are bright and perfect for around-the-house use and emergency use as well. Brighter than most lights since they are small it works out perfectly. The only question I still have is how long do they hold up... I don't know yet and haven't used them enough to call them ""used."""
1,Poor Dependability,"Stopped working after minimal usage - for a few moments maybe 6 times within the first month. Replaced batteries - worked once or twice, then out again. Perhaps the on/off mechanism is flawed. Also, not as durable as similar flashlights at a lower price. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Wish I would have read the reviews,"I bought it for my Wife, as she leaves work at night, and she has to tighten it or bang it, each time, just to make it work, Sometimes it doesn't, reguardless and it's only 5 days old....... I should have got a Brinkman or Maglite for her instead. As soon as she says enough of this pice of junk, I will!!!"
2,LED Flashlight,"I tested this product when I received it and it worked just fine. Not a good gift bag filler, however, as it is still in the gift bag it was given in."
3,"It IS aluminum, but NOT heady duty","Once again it proves the old maxim, you get what you pay for. If it seems too good to be true (heavy duty), then it probably is.Despite the questionable construction, the light DOES work, and it IS bright. So for as long as it may last (which sounds iffy according to other reviewers), it's probably worth the money as a throw away or a party favor. The batteries provided were seriously off off brand, and I don't expect much... but who knows. If it DOES last, it would definitely qualify as a good deal.Good luck..... If you play the lottery regularly, this might be the light for you!May you fine brightness in your life!"
1,Cheap and toxic,"First did not work at all, and the second has a broken seal. They both have warnings on them to wash hands after use due to lead contamination...so much for giving them to the kids!"
2,Arrived Damaged,"I anxiously waited for this little guy to come in the mail. When I opened up the package, it was all scratched up and had a pretty decent sized dent in it. This had to be pre-packaging/shipping because it was wrapped in bubble wrap and didnt appear to have any of the bubbles popped... I was disappointed... as for the light itsself, the beam is pretty bright up close, but does not have a long range of brightness, but I'm not surprised givin its size and price. If it didnt come damaged I would have given it 4 stars"
3,Shipping way too high,"The flashlight works OK, though you sometimes have to shake them to keep the light on. I bought two from eToolscity, however, the shipping was more than the cost of the items -- $12 surface shipping (6 oz shipping weight) for $10 worth of product. I'll never buy from eToolscity again."
2,Two Week Waiting period,"It is taking a long time to ship, two weeks estimate. There is no phone number by which to call etoolscity to make order inquiries, only email. If you want these flashlights in a timely fashion, you might want to order from a company that has customer service with phone numbers. Everything else I ordered on the same day from Amazon's smaller partners and other sites has already arrived."
3,Super-Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Cool Blue,I was expecting a much larger flashlight when I ordered this. I've used it quite a bit for over a month and it still shines near as bright as when I first got it so I am pleased with that but I thought a 9 LED flashlight would be brighter. Not that it's not bright - it is - but not near as bright as the 20 LED flashlight I bought at the same time. Overall it is a good SMALL flashlight for the money
1,"NOT heavy duty, broke the first time I used it.","I had misgivings as soon as I removed this flashlight from it's packaging. It has a thin gauge aluminum case that could easily be dented or torn. When I first powered up this flashlight, I was impressed by the diffused bright light. It lit up close by objects, but offered no illumination for objects more than 10 feet away.My biggest complaint is the reliability. I dropped it once. It stopped working. I am pretty handy with my hands, but I was unable to get the flashlight to light up again."
2,"We got two. One worked, the other one doesn't...","The one that works is nice. It is compact, but still a pretty good light. Plus the battery life seemed fine. However, the fact that the other one would not stay on and is always blinking off makes it so that I cannot recommend this product."
3,"compacta, resistente, pero hecha en china, petzl","Length:: 0:16 MinsLa lampara esta muy rustica, pero ilumina bien, no es del otro mundo, pero para aplicaciones más especificas la marca Petzl, es mejor. Eso si esta bonita."
1,Didn't last long,"Bought three of these and only one still works like it should. Spend a few bucks more and get a dependable light. Don't rely on this one when you need it, it may or may not work."
1,Arrived nonfunctional,"The flashlight arrived nonfunctional. Tried with batteries that came in package, with other (new) batteries, but would not switch on. Sent back for a refund."
3,"lots of light, low price",This light is compact and very bright. LEDs should last longer than the old style incandescent flashlight bulbs. Possible concern is that the aluminum housing is quite thin - not sure that it would survive a fall.
5,excellent quality square baker,I got this baker about one month ago and have used it almost everyday. The size is great for meals for one or dishes for two to three or desserts. The glossy finish is easy to clean and looks like new after each wash.
4,its good,i think its really good album especially for europe .they werent reall y tough band in the 80s.
4,"Beautiful,majestic,melodic.","This is one of the more maligned and most often overlooked rock albums of the late eighties,however it delivers(big time!)a very impressive combination of Euro(Scandinavian)-metal and majestic melodies with just enough guitar crunch to keep things hot.Great vocal harmonies make for a very interesting atmosphere.I consider this as the best Europe album ever,far surpassing'The Final Countdown'."
3,"Good in some places, a little too dry on some tracks","Europe's 1988 followup to their mega successful The Final Countdown was good. But Ron Nevison doesn't really blend well with this band's sound in terms of the production. Some bands he did albums for in the '80s Superstitious is still great, good midtempo rock. But some of the other songs sound a little too dry sounding, sometimes bland at times. Where The Final Countdown grabbed you with every song, this album has the same formulaic approach that Nevison gave to Heart's 1985 album. The album's best strength is the songwriting from Joey Tempest and the band members. That's what saves it from becoming a complete flop. But this was anonymous in 1988 compared to Bon Jovi and other bands that had more success that year."
1,rip-off,"the editorial review says ""the only Japanese remastered version"" of this gem. I was so thrilled when I got my ordered copy of what I expect to be the remastered version of this album just today. to my surprise, I got the same 1988 original album pressing! I was expecting it to be in a different packing since I thought it was a Japanese version. I have been waiting for so long to have this album remastered only to get very very disappointed! to the editorial staff at amazon you should be giving right and appropriate descriptions of the products you are posting for that's what and where we, the costumers refer our choices whether or not to give it a shot. the item is good, only not remastered."
4,Europe Rocks,"This album is pretty close to being at the level of greatness of most of Europe's other 80s albums, but by this time Europe had already peaked in popularity with The Final Countdown and this didn't sell a million copies in the States. In the 90s, Europe's live set lists were dominated by newer material, and this holds up well to their 90s material as well. This is their 4th album. Key tracks are: Superstitous, Ready or Not and Sign of the Times. Open Your Heart from the Wings of Tomorrow album is also here again."
3,europes 3rd release,"the swedes do it again with the 3rd release out of this world.the strong point of this cd is the guitar player change to new man kee marcello.marcello to me is far better on guitar than the other player on final countdown cd.joey tempest as always delivers the voice great as always & also done all of the writing.the song open your heart is redone to a different set of words & rythm, the result to me is a far better mix than the first.this is a great cd to play on a rainy day & dream about sweden.it didnt turn out to be a hugh success for the band but it wasnt their last.i been a europe fan from the first cd but they didnt catch america till mtv gave them a chance for winning a music contest the result final countdown was born....the swedes have always made good music from abba to yngwie malmsteen....europe is another."
5,80's Cheese!,It's definitely one for the collection. Great to drive to and lose your snowy white license. I reckon it's their best album and it has certainly kept many hard rock fans happy. If you're into 80's rock you'll love it. Difficult for younger generations to appreciate it though!
2,Something went seriously amiss here,"Yep, much as I love this band and have copped plenty of flack over the years for doing so, it has to be admitted that the wheels fell off for this one.First of all it's a total sell out. They wanted to be pop stars and not rock stars. In fact one of the reasons for John Norums departure was the desire of Joey Tempest to target the pop audience. Not a recipe for longevity and the boys should of known it.Secondly the songs sound like keyboard washed out takes of good songs. There are some hooks in the songs, and some emotion in the ballads though a reworking of ballads from earlier in your career in search of a hit is never a popular ploy with the fans.More grunt and less soft rock pomp should of been in order. Also not doing the north american leg of the Def Leppard tour would have to rate as one of the worst business decisions in hard rock history......But this was a temporary low"
4,An Excellent follow-up...,"...to The final countdown. ""The final countdown"" was such a big hit that many forget how popular ""Superstitious"" was also. It made the US Top 40 and got huge rotation on MTV. Out of this world basically continues the melodic direction set by The final countown, but this album has a little more crunch. The guitars are pushed up a bit. The album is a bit over-produced (to the band's admission) and could have been better if it had been left a little more rough. Still a fine album though. Lots of feel-good songs and unforgettable melodies all througout, especially in ""superstitious"", ""let the good times rock"", ""more than meets the eye"", ""sign of the times"" and ""never say die"". I just love Europe's ability to combine guitars with keyboards. Not unique, but rare. This is for all fans of melodic hard rock."
4,STILL ROCKS HARDD!,"I bought this on tape when I was 9 years old. Ten years later it still rocks just as hard! the musical arrangments are tight and hard, and the vocals harmonies are beautiful. They lyrics are great to sing along to and any glam rock band with a keyboard knows what's up. The slow songs rule and the fast ones are hard and rocking. Thiis may not be as good as some of their other stuff, but hey man, it rocks hard and that's all matters."
3,It's Not The Final Countdown,"Europe were a hair band from the 80s known almost only because of the Final Countdown and their extreme use of keyboards. This album has alot of keyboards and more slow power ballady songs than straight up rockers like the Final Countdown, but it is good none the less. Each song is good with a sing along chorus. Joey Tempest's voice on this album is excellent. Fans of ""The Final Countdown Era"" of Europe will most likely enjoy this. People who like a little more metal and a little less keyboards should check out Europe's first two albums for a more metal sound."
3,Out of This World - Europe,"Second choice of this excellent rock group, after ""The Final Countdown""CD."
3,extra-musical embellishments?,"I'll grant, I don't know a lot about historic recordings... but in the first movement, is it Walter who is grunting (rather loudly!) in time with the music? I've only just started to listen.. does this go on throughout? I hated Glenn Gould's moaning/humming, and these apparent grunts aren't endearing me to this recording. I know Bernstein allowed himself a good bit of this-- maybe he thought it sounded ""Mahlerian"" since Walter did it too...."
1,What a piece of [junk]...,My folks bought one of these cameras...it just quit working all together...after less than 2 weeks and less than 100 pics taken! It was like a computer freezing up; nothing worked at all. What a piece of junk.
1,Save you money and buy a quality camera,"I bought this camera and actually got the pictures to download one time through th usb cable, never through the serial. It never downloaded again. The lcd didn't work right. It only showed half the picture and half the time you could not even get it to come on. The one time it downloaded, the pictures did look good. I called support a number of times and that was a total waste of time. Three different people, three totally different answers and no help at all. Finally took the camera back and exchanged it. More problems than before. Forget this camera. Save your money and buy a decent camera like the Olympus D-450 or Sony Cybershot."
1,This camera ...!!!,"I recieved this camera as a Christmas gift. The very first time I tried to take a picture, it froze up on me and the only way I could do anything with it was to remove the batteries. As soon as I tried to take another picutre, it did the same thing all over again. I returned the camera and got my money back because the store didn't have any more in stock for an exchange. Later, I bought another camera - same model. This time, I can take 4 or 5 pictures and it freezes up again! Unfortunately, I bought the second camera at a store that went out of business so I'm stuck... can't return it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$ ON THIS CAMERA."
2,Polariod PDC 1300 digital camera,"I was enjoying the camera until I bought a compact flash card.I tried to remove the original card,but it was not easy.I inserted the new flash card and the pins inside the camera were bent in the process. Now I have a camera with no memory.I was very upset. I emailed Polaroid twice and I have yet to hear from them as to how to get the camera fixed.Meanwhile I tried straighten the pins to no avail.I bought the camera in June of 2001. I was learning how to use a digital camera. I was doing fine until this.Now I have a new 64 mb memory card for a new camera that I can not use anymore.I am still waiting for Polaroid to email me back with some help.If I hear from them I will let you know."
1,Hope you have better luck than I.,I bought this camera and had nothing but trouble with it. I got a really good deal and thought I'd try it. I ended up returning it to the store and did not get another. I didn't want another! I had lots of trouble with the camera freezing and had to do things over and over AND OVER!! It drove me crazy. I am giving up on cheaper digitals and going for something decent the next time.
1,not good service,latch on door breaks very easily and cost to fix is [money] had to take 2 back and 3rd one had to pay the cost plus shipping. Pictures are excellent but would not buy again. Feel like it is poor quality..
2,Polaroid PDC 1300,I saved for a long time to buy this camera. I have had some trouble with the pc card. When I take a picture it takes to long to take a picture. I have took alot of pictures of him and when the camera decides to take it he has moved and i have a picture of something else that is around him. I have to put new batteries in it very 15 to 20 pictures or take them out when I get done useing it so I dont have to buy batteries every day. And the printing quality is not that great either. I am not very pleased with the camera as you can tell and I thought it would be a good choice to buy something like this but i was wrong.
1,...,"This camera is horrible! It had problems the third day I used it to take pictures. The camera froze up on me and the only way that I got it to work again was to take the battery out and restart it. Polaroid told me that it was the flash card and sent me a replacement to fix the problem. Then it happened again, the camera froze and I lost all the pictures that I took. Then I called polaroid again and they told me that it was the camera. I sent the camera into repairs and they said that their was nothing wrong with the camera and sent it back to me without doing a thing about it. They even had the nerve of telling me that I needed to insert the flash card correctly to have it working properly. Now, they want to send me a refurbished camera to replace the camera that I currently have. Hell NO! I don't want anything from Polaroid, that company is crap and the camera is crap. If I could give this camera a rating of ZERO I would. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
2,"Find the older, better version.","I played True Colors many years ago with friends while working at a camp, and it ended up being one of those games we went back to frequently just for fun, and a lot of it!HOWEVER, it turns out that the version we played was an earlier release by Milton Bradley released in 1990, this version is very scaled down, so much so that it takes a lot of the fun out of it. In fact, I sent it back and got my money back."
1,not a good game,"Just to be blunt, this game is terrible. Three of my friends and I played this one night, it was awful. The questions are very critical and all you end up doing is saying bad things about your friends all night. We had 4 girls with very hurt feelings. The questions are like, who looks best in almost anything they wear. Well, when you are the only one that doesn't get ANY votes for that question, you can get to feeling pretty bad about yourself. I know its just a game, but its still not a game you need to play with anyone you want to remain friends with! Don't waste your money unless you are ready to be ultimately insulted!"
3,Fun game but gets old fast,"I bought this game because I had played it years ago and had so much fun.I was sorely disappointed to see just one stack of cards in the box, and I didn't find any place to buy refill cards. It's therefore easy to go through the cards with the same people--not a game to play with the same people very often.Also, the game is poorly organized. You hand in your color cards when you vote but have to coordinate giving them back before the next round--it's too much busywork. There should be enough color cards for the whole game.I wanted so much to like this game. It's not bad, but not worth the money."
4,True Colors Board Game,"This is a very fun game. The more people playing the better, 4 or more. This is a fun way to see what people think about you and makes you think of some interesting things about your friends. This game requires that one should know the people they are playing with an not someone barely known."
5,Fine album,"Chris de Burgh music can be a very good company. I experience this, out of home half a year, hear this album while dinner or rest. It was the only Cd i found in that coast house as i was in it, and dont need more."
2,For academics only,"The book is about St. Maximous and his writings. However there is no translation of St. Maximous works to be found here, rather a interpretation of his works by Prof. Thunberg.Its a long and tedious read at best and unless the reader knows the early church fathers and thinkers like Evagrius of Pontus, a lot of what is written will be 'greek' to the reader.As such it should appeal to religous scholars interested in St. Maximous's theology. Others should steer clear of it.Its sad that such a fine intellect like St. Maximous still lacks a decent translator. So far the only accessible translation of some of his works is the Philokalia Vol 2.The reason I'm only giving it two stars is that Lungberg did not include a translation of St. Maximous and being a excessive tedious and dry read."
2,Clutch forgets their roots,I can't help but wonder where Neil and the rest of the crew lost their anger and spite. This album is evidence of what money and a little fame will do to a man's integrity. I personally think that Neil's lady is the root of all this soft garbage. Go out and buy Passive Restraints (or Impetus as it is now known) and join me in mourning the loss of a great man. RIP
2,Their ONLY bump in the road,"I've been a very very big Clutch fan since picking up Speedway League on a whimb after seeing Shogun on Headbangers Ball in the early 90's. For me, this is the only Clutch album that is a letdown. I seem to be in the minority thinking this isn't a very good album, but it just isn't near as infectious as every other release they've put out thus far. I find the first 4 songs to be the only ones worth listening to time and again. I never would've guessed Clutch would've become what they have after seeing Shogun on the Ball years ago, but i'm glad they did. If you're just getting into Clutch, my advice is to get this release after getting all of their others first. My personal favorites are the self-titled and Speedway League, but you can't go wrong with Blast Tyrant or Pure Rock Fury either."
1,WHAT HAPPENED???,"What happened to the vocals? and the music? Is this really clutch? This album is garbage (to put it nicely). You are definitely better off with the other two previous Clutch albums. This one is a big dissappointment. His hoarse vocals are gone, the hard sound they used to have is gone. WHAT HAPPENED?????"
1,clutch is probably one of the worst bands ever!!!,"I can't explain how much these guys suck. Then people call them metal. I saw them live and i fell asleep during their set because it was so boring. The music is horrible, the lyrics are really bad too. The singer sounds like a redneck. I recommend that you don't buy this album if you are thinking about it to save yourself some $, unless you are a redneck from Hickville, and don't know what REAL metal is."
4,Think they're 'growing' as a band...,"I've been listening to Clutch since '93, when Transnational Speedway League came out. I found their stripped-down sound to be great, but what captured my attention was the unbelievably clever lyrics. Granted, I had to follow along via liner notes as Neil Fallon's vocal chords seemed to be shredding on every other track. Clutch is, by far, the most original of bands as far as songwriting goes; they're like a white-trash version of Rush. Now with this album, it's true, much of the aggression is gone and this is far more mellow, but the witty lyrics continue to flow. 'Ship of Gold' and 'The Soapmakers' being good examples of lyrical prowess and also good jams. Lastly, if you think Clutch has taken a mellower tack, hey--I'm down with any band that can work a trombone solo into the mix. Let's see other bands do THAT! So what if they're not as aggro as they were in 1993? Hey, maybe some of 'em got married and had kids! I have since then. Leave us old farts alone!"
5,One of the best bands ever,"This has got to be their best record along with their latest release. Every record Clutch puts out has a different sound and theme. Neil Fallon always has some great lyrics, and musically they are always tight like that. Fav tracks are, Elephant Riders, The Soapmakers, The Yeti, Muchas Veces, and Wishbone. Don't get me wrong I still love their first 2 records along with pitchfork and impetus but this is the best Clutch record."
3,Hillbilly groove metal?,"Clutch get even deeper into lowdown, grimy stoner-funk, almost all of these songs loping along at the same hillbilly-funk pace. The guitar riffs are pure blues, and the vocals actually sound somewhat like Primus, sort of a rap/sing fusion that rarely gets into the growling. This is a pretty groovy listen, though not hardcore at all. More oddball lyrics. Much of this album makes me thing of rednecks sitting around stomping their feet and playing washboards."
4,Takes its place in ecumenical dialogue,"In the spirit of Unitatis Redintegratio, these authors have embarked on a search of Christian history since the Reformation and how the evangelical Protestant view of Catholics has transformed through three major events: The election of John Paul II and his role in the collapse of communism, the Second Vatican Council, and the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that placed Catholics and Evangicals in America on the same team praying and working towards and end to the horrors of abortion.The book does not serve to be overly biased towards Protestants or Catholics, but remains very fair in its assessment of the history of both groups and where we stand today. I believe it should take its place on any bookshelf of readers who have a concern for ecumenical dialogue between Catholics and Protestants. Two thumbs up!"
5,Awesome Sheath!,"ALL 1200 series Kabars should have this sheath, it is one of the nicest I have ever used. If you own a Kabar you should definitely get this."
4,Exactly as expected,This sheath fits my Ka-Bar USMC fighting knife perfectly and is quite an exceptional value at the current low price.
4,KaBar Sheath,"LOVE THIS SHEATH! KaBar fits perfectly, no binding at all when unsheathing. Bouncing around all day when I hunt and knife stays right where its supposed to be and will be able to strap to leg or wherever you need it due to side holes for mounting. A really great sheath period!"
5,Definitely the best sheath for Ka Bar,If you own a Ka Bar than you should purchase this sheath. Works great for carrying in other areas other than on your belt. Knife locks into place and won't move till you take it out.
4,Needs Adjustment to fit MOLLE,This product is good but not great. The item is a hard plastic sheath and works well with the KaBar. The attachment to the MOLLE gear is difficult and requires some modification and extra equipment. If you go to an Army Surplus store they can help you with what you need to attach the sheath to your kit.
5,Exactly what I ordered,This sheath was exactly what I ordered. No problems and no surprises. I was very happy.
5,KA BAR ---- You want one or two or three,Large knife and great sheath.....cannot get much better.Other sizes available....if you like knives try them out you will not be disappointed.EDIT*****Review was for KA BAR Knife and the nice Sheath which I ordered together.....
5,It had a knife,But when it got hond my kid sax diss spouted thre wax only a mediorkra knife shifted no knif the louder got mot vleaf
2,not that good.,"The sheath surrounds the knife. That's as good a review as I can give.My Ka-Bar rattles around in this sheath. So I tried my sons. Same thing. The picture indicated there were two restraining straps, mine has one.I would not recommend this item to a friend. I would advise against it.Warm regardsChris in Florida"
1,This sheath is HORRIBLE!,"I don't understand how anybody could give this sheath a good review. I bought it as a combo with a next gen Kabar, which I also have a few complaints about, and right out of the box I knew the sheath was junk as soon as I touched it. It doesn't have the ""feel"" of other Kydex sheaths I own or have made. This just feels like a cheap plastic from Japan, oh wait, it is. It actually separates along the seams when you bend it just a bit. Take this out into the wild and you would have a great knife and a broken piece of plastic. I'll take Kabars leather sheath any day over this piece of junk. I'm very disappointed in you Kabar!"
5,Fits Perfect!,"Some reviews were good and others bad, but as long as you have the full size kabar you should be good to go! I am very satisfied with this product. Thank you!"
5,Great replacement for the standard leather sheath,"Rather than ramble on about how great this sheath is, I'll just mention a few features I really liked.-Knife snaps in place and snaps out with a simple push of the thumb (works for Righties AND Lefties) and stays in place even if held upside down or shaken.-There's a backup strap for the handle with a simple, sturdy snap.-There's opened channels on the outside of the sheath which are great for adding webbing or paracord.-Will fit any belt with plus there's a swivel that allows for horizontal carry or mounting if you choose to add cordage or webbing.-Kydex is extremely stury and durable."
5,Great deal,"Perfect fit for the Ka-Bar model 1211 combat knife with 7"" blade. Numerous attachment options. Great replacement for the stock leather sheath."
3,Not Bad,"For the price of $15 dollars, you get what you paided for. Not the best and FAR from the worst. I belive that this sheath is built for the D2 model and NOT the Combat Utility BUT you can make it work."
2,useless,"Purchased to go with the Ka Bar Bowie, but it did not fit. Now it just collects dust. There was nothing in the product details that indicated that these two items were incompatible. Fact, I felt that the product details indicated that they were compatible. Be weary."
5,Excellect,Value for the money. This with the 1217 might be the best camping combo. Toss the Walmart & big 5 crap in the trash.
5,Fits like it says it does on the knife its made for,The best thing about is that you can wear it on your side or strap it with 5-50 cord to your molle gear. Easy to unsheathe with one hand for those who like the Tomahawk knife combo. This allows you to place the blade either way in the sheath so you can draw it blade up or blade down.
5,Best Sheath there is!,"I love the Kydex sheaths. They fit the knives perfectly and are sturdy, durable and high quality. I recommend Kydex sheaths they are way better then your standard leather sheath."
4,Recommended for a Ka-Bar knife,"I would recommend this if you purchase a Ka-Bar knife. The stock sheath is fine, but I think you'll find this much more practical and easier to use."
5,Kydex KA-BAR Sheaths,"""All I can say is, I am 100% happy with these Sheaths (I bought two more after seeing the first two) and the service I received from the seller. The second two were a bit slower getting to me than the first two; but well under the time they gave for shipping."""
2,A nice magazine piece,"The book is TEDIOUS. A few mediocre yarns and lots of detail about Irish horseracing last year and before. Lots of old, once-charming Irish cliches repeated and repeated. Too many names, too much trivial detail about weather, horses and people you don't need to know.I'm a horse owner and interested in racing. I was bored after 50 pages, but battled on for awhile. Maybe the ending is a corker, but I doubt it. Never got that far.This would make a good 1,500-word magazine piece. Barich is a good writer, but this book is destined for the remainder table - and soon. It is a chore to read it. I think two stars is generous."
3,My Son,I really enjoyed watching this movie as my son is one of the fighters in the show. I was told that it had been released but the name had been changed since the filming. If you like this type of movie then certainly I say get it.A Fan
3,A chilling Book,"An interesting look at what makes a man like Chris Barnard tick. A chilling experience to see how a man can put human suffering out of his mind in order to experiment on humans when he was no longer satisfied with using animals. A man adrift, unable to secure bonds on earth with wife, children or co-workers, Chris does write with surprising honesty about what drove him to do the things he did (like attaching a second head on a live dog just for fun!). An interesting read if you have the stomach for it."
3,A fun game,"It's a fun family game. Depends an awful lot on luck, so don't get it if you're looking for a major intellectual challenge (like my sister). Meanwhile, good for learning to do math in your head for kids in Jr. high and up!"
5,Please don't forget it!,My children have all enjoyed the game. It will be great to take on out camping trips over the summer!
4,Great ramp for the price,"I gave this 4 stars because my fiance had to put wood underneath the ramp, so that he could load his riding lawnmower. He had to put the wood underneath because when loading the lawnmower half way up it would get stuck on the ramp."
5,Buy this ramp!,"I am very tight with my money let me start off. So when I seen this ramp at this low price, I figured it would be flimsy and not well made. I was very wrong! This ramp's design is exceptional with excellent performance. It easily holds my biggest riding mower with me (225lbs) on it. The ramp is sleek and attractive and very light weight. This is an excellent buy, shipped to my door within two days, all assembled and I used the ramp a minute after the ups guy dropped it off. You have to buy this ramp don't waste your money on some of these other ramps for 200.00-400.00."
3,Good for students,"I bought this book to help my bachelor level students learn the parts of the brain. They found it helpful in their learning process to color the parts of the brain. Although, because they are bachelor level students, there were only a few pages that were surface knowledge...lots of detailed pictures that would be more appropriate for doctorate level."
5,A Must Buy,"This was a great tool to use while studying neuro. I would buy it again, and would tell my friends to do the same. It was very helpful, and gave detailed pictures that I couldn't find anywhere else, even on the internet."
5,Hilarious French comedy,"If you see only one French movie in your life, make it this one. The Tall Blond Man is rolling-in-the-aisles funny. The sequel is also very funny, but not quite as funny. Mind you, the sequel is funnier than many recent comedies from both sides of the Atlantic, but I can't think of a funnier movie than the original Tall Blond Man."
5,Great CD!!!,"This is one of my favorite CDs..it's amazing..from the start of bulldozer, you know this CD is gonna pump you up. And it does. My personal favorite song is American High, which talks about how the singer's life was at school and how he was picked on and so on. It's pretty much a positive CD. I love it! Go and get it!"
2,not their best,"this really isn't a very good album. after having to wait a while since their last album i was kind of disappointed. i really liked the direction they were taking with 'burning red' but this just sounds like all the other 'crud' coming out today in the so-called 'nu-metal' genre (i.e. primer 55, presure 4-5, anything else with a number in it...). the whole album is very generic and no song really stands out from the others, although 'deafening silence' is somewhat reminiscent of the spacier-type sound they explored on 'burning red.' if you're looking for some quality metal from a band still somewhat unknown, i'd suggest Lifer's self-titled debut album. you could do worse than 'supercharger,' though...it's still better than limp bizkit."
5,Their next best album behind burn my eyes,"I feel that this album is Machine Heads' second best next to Burn My eyes. I know they can't make another album as sharp as that one, that much is evident with this album and the previous 2 after Burn My eyes, but I'm gonna give credit to where its due here, Supercharger is solid, and any real Machine Head fan will agree if his brain isn't shot. With each song on the album highly enjoyable, My standout favorites are Nausea, Kick you when you're down, Bulldozer, American High, Trephination and Supercharger. I can't wait to see them again in concert."
1,What the hell happened??,"After the so-so ""The Burning Red"", I had high expectations of this album. Then, when I heard it, it felt like it was a bad version of their previous album! The only good songs in this disgrace are Trephination and the title track. Robb, please, stop rapping!! You sound like a complete poser! I hope the next album this guys do is more in the vein of Burn My Eyes, which is, in my opinion, one of the 10 greatest metal albums of all time. Snooch to the nooch!"
2,short message,There is absolutely NO excuse for american high. there never has been and there never will be. machine head has stooped to a new low. they think they're black now. don't buy this CD unless you like cocky rap-metal and horrible sounding singing this time around.
1,OH MY WORD....... I WASTED MONEY,"This album is so damn lame it hurts my fingers typeing this. I hope you potetial buyers beware. This, and I repeat, this is not BURN MY EYES. I swear another band was on this record because they couldnt have put out such a lame brain CD. They ... on this album. your money is better spent buying a neil diamond greatest hits album, just kdding but please save your money."
1,Deadbolt's Daily Review,"I don't really know what to say about this album. All the other stuff I've reviewed have had a particular style, but this album seemed kind of tired. I'm not saying I don't like this album. I do, and I tried had to. I really did. It's alright. That's it. ""Bulldozer"" has some really cool whipping guitar in, and the death-metal style screaming is quite overwhelming...some of the time. Other times it just doesn't sound ""musical"" at all.Hmm, and that's all I can say. A pretty average album, really. Not one to buy if your a first-time listener to Machine Head, or don't buy albums regularily."
1,Superstinker,"I like 2 machine head albums, and their probly not the 2 you think. Burn My Eyes, and The Burning Red. The More Things Change is not a BAD album, but its pretty boring. I though Burn My Eyes was just an amazing peice of thrash metal, and The Burning Red had some wonderful melodic song work on it. I don't care what anyone says, the Buring Red Kicks Ass!! This album however, SUCKS HARD!!!Not a single good song on here. It doesnt even feel like machine head! I'm not a huge metal head anymore but every now and then i listen to some of my old sutff, and I recelty listend to all my machine head albums and was reminded about how TERRIBLE this album was! It just seems so rushed, and warted down! I was hoping It was a joke. I hear they have a new one now thats suposed to be fantastic, so i gota check that one out. But yea, if your just getting in to MH STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!"
3,"Forgiven, if their next album is better","very disappointed, i guess this ablum was just for the sake of it, i guess they tried to be a bit different.....and having not impressing us....they should forget abt it all....and get back to how they were when they came out....this album has very few nice songs.....why the hell does robb want to rap...i dont understand.....but i still forgive them for this(cuz they are my fav band)...only if their next album is like the first two."
1,"Why Rob, why???!?","After their crown jewel, ""Burn My Eyes"" this is a tragic turn of events. This and that train wreck ""The Burning Red"".With this kind of nu-metal garbage, I'll be surprised if MachineHead stays together. It's gonna take a miracle for Rob to pull them back up to the top again."
1,The remains of what was once a great band,"Horrid horrid horrid horrid...One of the best American Thrash bands ever exist has steadily became utter trash the past couple releases. The Burning Red I could stomach, there were a couple good tracks on it, enought to redeam the album. But Supercharger just goes ever further down the road of mediocrity. Crashing Around You echoes Korn, as does much of the rest of the album...American High is a disgrace to music in general...White Knuckle Blackout..Kick You When Your Down...not one good track on this album. Expect Machine Head to break up a little down the road."
2,I will wait next album of machine head,I'm a big fan of machine head.This is a great band.I haveall of their CDs and I still love to listen to them.Butthis cd is very bad.I just only like 3 track on this album.This album makes me so sad.I hope their next album can makesme delight.Anyway I already throw this album.
3,If you insist on comparing this to BURN MY EYES....,"....you will be sorely disappointed. ""Burn My Eyes"" was a metal masterpiece, which stumps me. Why would this once great band mess with a good thing? On ""Supercharger,"" the standout tracks are ""Bulldozer"" and the album-titled final track. As with ""The Burning Red,"" much of this album contains rather boring nu-metal riffing (a la Filter) and a myriad of other [things]. Overall, this isn't a bad disc. But is it a mandatory purchase? Far from it. Buy used if possible."
3,Just ok,"Not bad and not god this album is. Im totally neutral about the songs and it reminds me a little Limp Bizkit . I don't care really if they have changed their style in this album as how good the result is , and unfortunately is not so good. Only for collectors of Machine Head albums."
3,Nothing great but decent.,"This is at much better than the Burning Red and it's a decent album overall. Heavier, which is a good thing and less nu-metal. It's still a nu-metal album but it doesn't sound too generic or mainstream. Machine Head have been back ever since this album and Through the Ashes of Empire is when their return to form comes. The More Things Change and Burn my Eyes are still my favorite MH albums but Supercharger's a decent album. Deafening Silence and Only the Names are my favorites and I still play them regularly when listening to Machine Head. Lyrically it's great and the music isn't too good but it's acceptable. The rapping in several songs gives it a nu-metal sound but it's still better than a lot of nu-metal out there."
5,STOP WHINING!,"Machine Head never fail to put out a good album. A lot of people like to slam this album for whatever reason (lack of guitar solos, too much melody, etc.) but truth is this is a great album. Machine Head's sound never really changed too much, as a lot of people like to say. Some people even call them sellouts, which is totally untrue. I think all that really differs with this album and The Burning Red is more melody is involved. And also, there aren't as many guitar solos. But they haven't cut out the solos completley. I don't know what all the fuss is about. Songs like ""Bulldozer"" , ""White Knuckle Blackout"" and ""Nausea"" (among others) still sound like anything that would have come out on Burn My Eyes or The More Things Change. In my opinion this is one of the best albums of 2001 and should be owned by any metal fan. So go ahead and buy this if you dig anything else Machine Head has put out."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I like Machine Head a lot. Many people disliked ""The Burning Red"" and called them sell-outs, but I appreciated the effort to make something different. Then came ""Supercharger"". I have listened to it a dozen times, looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it. It never came. This is a bad CD by a great band."
1,Yuck!!!!,"This is by far the second worst Machine Head yet. It seems that this band has been on a steady decline since the release of their second album. ""Burn My Eyes"" was amazing. Tight riffs and killer production and the best metal album to come out in a long time. Then after that album, they have slowly been on a downward spiral since then. ""The More Things Change"" was an OK album, the riffs got a little more simpler, and along came ""The Burning Red"". I was TOTALLY dissapointed with that piece of (You know what). Just a worthless and uninspired CD. Now we come to Supercharger, a little better than their last, but not by much at all. I have listened to this CD twice, and having trouble finding anything redeeming about it. It ranks above their last CD, but not by much. That's too bad, they most certainly had a bright future ahead of them, now it's getting foggier. Later."
4,nofx keeps on punkin',"though it is hard to capture the intensity of a punk show on cd, this one does a pretty good job of it. with some hilarious dialogue between songs, the best songs in my opinion are linoleum and bob. if youre into cali punk, but havent seen a show- buy it!"
5,Awesome,This cd is awesome. this is the first nofx cd i bought and it is awesome. the band is awesome. their music their views on mtv and the radio and so on. they are awesome! this cd has some funny tracks that are good. this cd is great! but it!
4,I Heard They Rock Live,"This is a great live NOFX CD. It has songs from 7 of their albums, but mostly songs from ""White Trash..."". Unlike most bands NOFX actually play a good live show, and it actually sounds good. I think they could have made the CD better by playing some more popular songs like ""Leave It Alone"", or ""Please Play This Song On The Radio"", instead of songs like ""Kill All The White Man"" and ""Buggley Eyes."" The best song on here is ""Bob"", because Hefe's horn sounds great and the music is played perfectly. The CD is pretty funny, but I find it hard to tell who's talking cause they sound very similar. I recomend you get this CD after you get the 7 with these songs on it. So stop looking at reviews and go buy it!"
1,GUESS WHAT... THEY WERE RIGHT!,"NOFX really do suck live. On CD, at least. Like most ""live"" albums, this one does not bring out the band's good side. They sound terrible and the cheering and screaming takes away from the music. If you're interested in hearing them live - go see a live show instead!"
5,One of the most unforgettable biographies ever!,"This book touched me and changed my whole view of the term 'martyr'. I have since become a great fan of Wurmbrand, his books never fail to stun one into a deep, reverential silence."
4,Very nice rack...,"Stores my wine where it is accessible and looks great. Construction is solid. The rack itself has a decent heft. Would definitely buy another one, but wine doesn't stick around my kitchen.... :)"
4,antheil returns,"Tremendously entertaining, a forgotten corner of musical history, from a kid out of Trenton, New Jersey!"
3,The long black coat,"The long black coat was not a very good book, it did not have a very good climax, hardly any suspense. Not really an action book. But if you like books about life with a twist you will like this book. Still Jay Bennett is still has a good book out there...the exeacutioner <------read it."
4,What about the economy?,"Good album by a good band , before this album NUFAN had a some albums that were just hot or miss nothing consistently good and appealing but it semms that on this one they finally nailed down what kind of style they wanted to accomplish. This and Making friends are probably the best two albums of their career so far."
2,THIS IS NOT THE CD EVERYONE TOLD ME ABOUT,"So i go and buy this tape...What a joke while the lyrics are good. The music is horrible...Mabey i've gone crazy but, this cd sucks"
1,leche con aburrimiento,"what an awful band!!!!! stupid lyrics, same rhytms, all those bands sound the same, why don't you try with lyrics more real...grown up, kids!!! the real punk is into the 70's...the roots."
4,"Good, but not Great","I first heard this band on a fat comp and thought they were pretty cool. And then I heard ""Straight From The Jacket"" and that convinced me to but it. But it wasn't that great of a CD. If your a Hard-core punk fan though pick it up. If not buy something mellow with its share of punk like Millencolin."
4,"A great-sounding, well done, punk album.","Great music, great lyrics: remains the best NUFAN album to date!! SoCal punk rawk all the way, daddy."
4,a damn good but not the greatest N.U.F.A.N. album,"this album is pretty good, it has its share of hits such as justified black eye, which I think is on a fat wreckchord compilation, the last song is a great song as well, called ""Exit"", other than the all the other songs are up to par with other N.U.F.A.N. albums, I recommend buying this album"
3,different,concept is okay if you are family/procreating type.it doesn't explore different lifestyles.it is okay but not extraordinary.
2,"Interesting ideas, but slipshod execution","Intriguing idea well enough described in the other reviews. But the material is presented in a formulaic way - at times it felt like I was re-reading Canterbury Tales because each new character was a new ""adventure"", but with much less interesting descriptions and stories. What kept me reading to the end was the desire to see where the author took the whole thing - and it wasn't a really satisfying place. Townsend seems to have done as everyone told him he would do - learn to accept and trust authority. Everyone lives happily every after. Yuck."
5,DeBugh's at his Best,"The song writing on this album is amazing ... powerful lyrics make this a classic album. Chris DeBurgh's ability to tell a story in a 3 minute song occurs on several tracks ... ""Spanish Train"" is a classic, and ""Spaceman Came Travelling"" is still played at Christmas time on the radio, a different twist aboutwhat happened on that special Christmas eve. My favorite is ""Lonely Sky"", a sad ballad, but written well. ""Old Friend"" and""I'm Going Home"" are also beautiful songs about friendship and the important things in life, and everybody knows ""Patricia the Stripper"", a fun song about a stripper who says ""God made her a sinner, just to keep fat men thinner"". In all, a classic work that should be in your C.D. collection!"
4,A classic album. Lost a star for a few corn tracks,"One of those collection classics. Unfortunatly the artist is famous for Women in Red not this album. This is not pop and is unlikly to be on most radio stations. Listen to ""Space man came travelling"" ""The Painter"" or the title track and you have your monies worth. Dropped a star for a couple of corny (aka non excellent) tracks."
1,Jimmy Ray is a one-hit wonder.,"Jimmy Ray's debut album is one of the worst. He can't sing that good. The only good song is ""Are You Jimmy Ray?"" His album isn't worth one cent. Even that would be a waste of money for that CD."
2,One-Hit Wonder&#65533; But It's Great!,"His first (and only) hit was ""Are You Jimmy Ray?"" a Top 10 gold single in early 1998. Aside from this fun, Elvis-esque retro jam, there isn't any additional material that would sell, but it isn't bad. Jimmy Ray's image is quite appealing; almost hypnotizing. His voice will do just fine when it comes to the retro-rock he hammers on his debut album. I especially liked ""Goin' To Vegas."" He may have one-hit wonder written all over his handsome face, but it's fun while it lasts."
3,GOOD NOT GREAT!!,This was a good movie. It was great to see an all asian cast but the film reeked of an MTV afterschool special. Certainly not the greatest film i've ever seen but I hope it opens up the path for other all asian casts.
4,Where's my Asian Friend?,"It's about time someone told the true coming of age story involving Asian-Americans in their most harsh environment, high school. To the standard eye, they live typical Asian lives, trying to reach the perfect 1600, dealing with overbearing Asian parents, basically being outcasts, but behind close doors, they want to break out of the standard that society has put them in. I love the casting in this movie, especially John Cho (MILF!!!!!) The ending had me really shocked at the end. The DJ Shadow track at the end was the topping on the cupcake. The only special feature was the commentary from the director, but what do you expect from such a low budget film."
2,MTV FILM IS NO ROCK AND ROLL FUN,"This film isn't deserving of the controversy it created in depicting Asian American teenagers involved in petty crime which escalates into heavier criminal activity. No, this film is guilty of much more. Just when it has walked the plankboard of typical high school teen angst as depicted in scores of other minority based films, it then jumps into the cold water relying on 'hammer to the head' dramatic shock value to give the aimless narrative some direction. Aside from this violent murder scene that the movie seems to celebrate, this is really dull stuff, like watching the kids from TV's ""Beverly Hills 90210"" walking down an endless school corridor sporting guns under their belts. The dramatic hook at the beginning of the film is a tremendous letdown by movie's end. ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" is tough luck today."
2,"Been There, Seen It.","At first it's mildly interesting that the kids in this paint-by-numbers teens-gone-bad movie are Asian American. Then, as they devolve into Asian American stereotypes--they're all academically driven genius nerds at first, then become a street gang--that slight interest wears off, and you're left with a movie that says absolutely nothing about teens that hasn't been said 100 times before. And it says that very very slowly and dully and over way too many minutes. Some fine acting, but it's wasted on this utterly unimaginative film. In the end it's kind of a cynical exercise in getting out the ethnic vote."
3,All right,"I was not that impressed by the movie. It's like a delinquent movie, except that the youths are Asian. The movie does have a little feel of a Tarentino movie, which makes it better."
3,Fantastic Low Budget Story...,"Ben is preoccupied with creating the perfect life for himself by being successful in everything. However, he finds himself having very few friends and there is something missing in his life. In the disguise of his good grades and extracurricular activities he is drawn into a darker world involving crime, drugs, and guns with his friends. This leads to an indulgence in self importance and social status, which is intertwined with pleasures, love and more crime. Better Luck Tomorrow is a fantastic story that was filmed on a modest budget. However, there are moments when the cinematography seems ludicrous and the acting is stiff, which causes some awkwardness in the story. Overall, the cinematic experience is a satisfactory event that muses and entertains the audience."
2,Weird,"This was on ok movie. The kids were differnt from any school I have ever attended. I only rented it for a class assignment. It was weird, but pretty good."
3,Not for heavy use,"We originally bought this strictly for a traveling monitor since the one we already had in the nursery was large and mounted on the wall. It worked great for a little while, but slowly it deteriorated. It lasted less than a year, with mild use.Now, 2 years later, I still have it, but only as a short term backup. Once it's on, it works great for about 5 minutes, then the sound will get so scratchy and loud that I have to turn the volume all the way down. After about 30-45 minutes, the picture will start to go out (lots of lines, fuzziness and jumping).Maybe we got a faulty model or something go messed up during travel - who knows. But based on my experience, I have not/would not recommend this monitor."
5,Fun for all ages,"My 8 year old daughter asked for this game last year after a vacation. I honestly thought it would be played with once or twice and then gather dust on a shelf. Thankfully, I was proved very wrong as she plays with it frequently still. This set is not particularly fancy; the animal shaped plastic pieces appeal to the younger set while still retaining the classic elements of the game. I do wish there was a storage area for the pieces (we use a resealable plastic bag) and it would be nice to have the option to buy additional animals in case a few were misplaced. Otherwise, we're very happy with this purchase and I'd definitely recommend this games for ages 4 and up."
4,Needs craftsmanship!,"Fun game, kids love the animals, educational, but the wooden case is poorly made and the clasp broke the first time we opened it."
5,STRUNG OUT! enough said....,"This was my first real punk rock CD, and I have never been the same since.... This CD is fast, hard, and very clean. The lyrics are so thought out and meaningful... This is grade a Punk Rock.... Buy this album.... If you like strung out, also try twisted by design."
5,MOST AWESOME CD EVER,Kick Ass Punk...This CD punches u in the crotch and kicks u in the head twice while ur down...that wat this amazing cd does to u...if ur thinking about getting it...then get it!!!
5,Classic,"This book collects the opening salvo to Howard Chaykin's American Flagg comic book series. A comic that was a little Philip K. Dick, A little Vonegutt Jr. and all Howard Chaykin. Sex, social satire, and great art. This book was and may still be ahead of it's time. I highly recomend."
2,For geeks only,"I bought this program after much research, showing many glowing reviews. Maybe the program is good for geeks who know how to set it up, but I don't want to spend my life adjusting the settings, especially since I don't know what I'm doing. It sometimes interferes with normal (presumably safe) Internet use, requiring me to check and adjust the settings, but I am guessing every time I do this. I may be making my computer LESS safe. I can't tell, and the program doesn't tell me, either. Zone Alarm's ""support,"" unless you want to pay, consists mostly of answers from other users, most of whom are also geeks. They mean well, but they speak Geek. So I had to register, then post questions, then wait for an answer, which usually produces more questions."
3,Would be better with clearer information about hike locations and details.,"It's an interesting book with what look like some good hikes. However, the casual location details and lack of real maps or gps coordinates (at least for starting points) make it a chore to find a hike by region and put together a plan for doing it."
3,Size matters,"There is nothing wrong with the product as a whole, Ijust thought the capsules were going to be smaller.It seems impossible to find fish oil products that aresmall. They were for my daughter and she can't swallow them."
3,Fishy Burp Taste,"I tried this product and found it worked great the first time. But when I bought a second bottle, I experienced the burpy fish taste all day for the next two days - so I had to stop using it. If you don't mind the fishy burp taste - then this is a good product. But if that is important to you, you may want to keep looking for a different fish oil pill."
1,Flu-like Symptoms,"I bought this product because I wanted to try an Omega-3 product. Super Fisol had a coating that is supposed to lessen the occurrence of nausea. For me, that didn't happen. Instead, I ended up with daily headache, stomach pain, and a disturbing change in the way food tasted. The only positive thing that happened was that my skin temporarily cleared up. Luckily, I seem to have suffered no permanent damage from this unpleasant experience."
5,Need fish oil and hate the cod liver burps?,"This is the only product I use to ingest fish oil and I have literally tried them all. I love it as these do not break down in the stomach but, instead break down in the small intestines, providing for better absorption and no fish burps."
2,Gave me perilous bad breath,"My wife starting complaining that I had bad breath. It would not go away with brushing, tongue cleaning... you name it. The bad breath went away as soon as I stopped taking this product."
1,Bad!,I had to throw this away because the inside seal was removed. It was very suspicious because the enteric coating was a different color from the Fisol I have been buying at Whole Foods forever. I will go back to more expensive but safe quality at Whole Foods.
3,Five Star Book One Star Protagonist,"I read Mars in 1981, shortly after the end of a heartbreaking relationship I had with an heir of a wealthy Zurich family. This book is a dead-on indictment of the emotional deadness of the Swiss upper class. The book is beautifully written, and I would have given it five stairs, but the protagonist is a one-star person. The book never answers the question - why couldn't such a privileged intelligent person pull himself out of his emotional isolation? Answer - because he didn't want to. Form over substance - that's the Swiss upper class philosophy and G-d help you if you don't have the right pedigree, clothing, furniture, social status, interests, and appearance."
5,Sweet looking boots!,"These are very nice looking boots, classey but yet they can be worn with jeans. The company is very professional and their right on it, no complaints about anything!"
3,Good but certainly not nearly his best...,"If you are an avid Peter White fan, go out and get this cd as it will blend in nicely with the rest of your collection. If you are looking for this cd to surpass 'GLOW', in my opinion his finest cd, it doesn't come close. It is certainly listenable but to me, it just never really grabbed me like some of his other previous releases. I don't regret buying it but I am somewhat disappointed in it just the same."
5,Great album,"I'm new to Peter White, though I've heard him on smooth jazz radio stations. Being a fan of Paul Hardcastle and Spyro Gyra I found White's Confidential collection very easy to get into. From pulsating Latin felt ""Endless Journey"" and ""Confidential"" to Christopher Cross' ballad ""She's in love"" the entire album was a great addition to my summer music."
5,Confidential - Peter White,This whole entire album was nothing less than perfection. Peter takes you from one level to another level on each track. The warmth and sensitivity that he puts in his music is fantastic. You can feel every emotion in each song.
5,There Is Nothing Confidential About This Artist,"Wow! Peter White has done it once again. A terrific album loaded with something for every Smooth Jazz listener. The cut with Christopher Cross is reminiscent of the Arthur theme. And Mindi Abair seems to be everywhere these days! Her collaboration with Peter White on ""Are You Mine"" is terrific. Of course, all the other collaborators are superb; Brian Culbertson, Paul Brown, etc. A must buy for any Peter White fan!"
5,This is what clean hair feels like,"I never knew what clean hair felt like until I tried this shampoo and conditioner. I usually use Herbal Essence's Long Term Relationship shampoo and conditioner and I always thought it was great, then I got bored of it and decided to try this product. The difference is amazing. The shampoo smells great and citrusy and lathers wonderfully, I love it! And the conditioner is great too, it goes on kind of weird and makes it seem like you didn't put enough on because it kind of soaks into your hair quickly, but once you rinse, WOW. When my hair dried it felt SUPER soft, and CLEAN, this is what clean hair feels like, it's amazing! No residue! And it doesn't weigh my hair down. My hair is really thin and pin straight, and gets oily and greasy really fast, even right after washing with my normal shampoo, but not with this shampoo! I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner, my hair smells great and feels great!"
2,Did not have same experience,"After Herbal Essences decided to do away with my favorite shampoo, I went in search of a replacement. I was happy to read the description of this one because it fit my hair type exactly - greasy roots and frazzled ends.I tried this shampoo and the frazzled ends became worse! I was truly puzzled, and thought it was my imagination. I even purchased the conditioner and used it only on the ends but it just didn't make a difference.One of the other odd things that I noticed is that I had to use more of this shampoo to wash my hair. With other shampoos, I can get a smaller amount and start at the scalp and it will work through all the way to the tips. However, I had to use 2x as much of this shampoo, as it seems to just absorb itself into my scalp and won't spread to the tips.I have given it a fair shake; I've been using it for 6 weeks consistently. You may want to purchase this locally first before buying a 4 pack to see how well it works for you."
2,Disappointing,"This is the worst of Coal Chamber's albums. Their self-titled album was nice and heavy, and not terribly repetitive. Chamber Music was definitely their best album because it was truly dark with seemingly minimal effort. Dark Days makes me feel like Dez is trying a LITTLE too hard to sound dark and scary, and really just comes off as annoying. The album is sadly repetitive and boring. ""Fiend,"" ""Something Told Me,"" and ""Dark Days"" are the only tracks that even struck me as decent. I strongly recommend ""Chamber Music"" or even ""Coal Chamber"" rather than this [garbage]."
3,1 step forward 8000 steps back,"This album is nothing like their first cd, it seems like they are starting to sell out, without even really selling out to anybody. Not very powerful, andi thought they had something going for them too.......... oh well, I guess I'll have to listen to Korn or Mudvayne now."
4,Excellent!,"This is the best Coal Chamber album. The first album rocked very hard, but was undermined slightly by so-so sound. Chamber Music was let's say, lackluster. An overproduced version of the first. Dark Days isn't breaking any new musical ground, but it sounds 100 times better than Chamber Music. This CD is going in my top 50 all-time greatest. My favorite, ""Fiend"" sounds a bit like Marilyn Manson, and kicks the CD off nicely. The title track sounds like it came off of the first CD, but got polished a little bit more. Overall, if you're a disenchanted Coal Chamber fan (like I was), give 'em a break and give this one a listen. If you're a fan of the genre, this is a must have. And if you like your music hard, loud, and fast, this is for you."
2,Talk about unoriginal....,"Okay, I know that most nu-metal will sound like KoRn, since they practically invented the genre (depending on how you look at it), but this is just unacceptable. It's almost the same thing as KoRn, but without the emotional power of Jonathan Davis. Coal Chamber's pitifully unoriginal, and if you were to pick between wannabes of KoRn and KoRn, you should just get KoRn.Now, this album does have the song ""Fiend"", but is that really worth fourteen bucks? No. Very mediocre."
4,Probably their worst effort,"This is a great CD. But not nearly as good as their s/t or Chamber Music. Chamber music was my personal favorite. Every song on this CD sounds very much the same. Not exactly though. The thing I don't like is that it has no regular singing like it does on the first two CDs. I would recommend getting this CD though, it's not worth the price of a new CD, see if you can get it used."
3,"Good for fans, bad for first time listeners","I have to admit, this is my favorite CD by the band. No 5 stars? Why? I'm sorry but this is basicly their first CD with a updated sound. Their debut CD brought their sound into the ears of people back in 1997. Not highly original but it was defnitly a darker tone to the already dark tone set by Korn back in the Nu Metal hey-day. Chamber Music, their second CD, was a step forward for the band when they incorporated a more gothic sound to the mix. Dark Days lacks on improvement though. Dez still singing his corny lyrics and sounding like the cookie monster and Meegs still riding those two note songs. It would have been nice to see some more addition to the song writing but that is not apparent. Now, what I do like about the CD is exactly what i said. It's exactly what any fan of coal chamber should expect. Anyone who has not heard anything by them up to this point should stay away though cause this will come off as just plain bad."
5,Great Disc Came on time,Well i bought Coal Chambers CD and it came how any other CD would come from amazon on time and in great condition i listened to the songs and the where great if you like that type of dark vibe type of music overall i was happy with my purchase.
4,HEAVY BRUTAL CHAMBER!!!,"This is the last and BEST album by Coal Chamber! By this time, Dez Farfara no longer sounds like Jonathan Davis or Rob Zombie and creates a personal raw gutural scream type voice that sounds amazing!!! DARK DAYS got great tunes like FIEND, SOMETHING TOLD ME, ALIENATE ME and ONE STEP!!!"
4,Coal Chamber at their best,"One of the best albm from coal chamber.heavy, dark, and have all the things metal needs.the best song i would say has to be DARK DAYS.just like the songs and albums name and the cover art. very cool druming and guitaring.MUST BUY ALBUM.but wait!! if u r looking something like slipknot. then it's not for u."
1,Absolutely nothing to be gained from this album,"I gave this album an honest listen, with an open mind and ears. Brad Fafara's lyrics, just as in their two other horrid releases, love to repeat the same laughable lyrics over and over in the same format choruses. Sure, I hear they put on a good live SHOW, but that says absolutely nothing for this lackluster music. They love to live at the same tempo for darn near every single song on all 3 of their albums. Fafara sounds like he's gurgling phlegm when he yells, in comparison to some of the other more listenable howlers out there, such as Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed (*gasp* real lyrics, coherent too!). Once again, don't expect anything new. This has all been done before, there is absolutely no improvement in the band whatsoever. Read this and go listen to some worthwhile music elsewhere."
2,UNRELIABLE,"Two days after I enthusiastically purchased this light, it started working only intermittently. Evidently there is some type of problem with a contact somewhere because it only lights part of the time. About 50% of the time it won't light when turned on - it must be banged against something (usually my hand) in on order for it to light and then it will go out from time to time if not held steady. Cheap? yes. Reliable? No way."
2,having same problem as others..,My light also works intermitingly..pushing on the lens or tapping it works but then goes out again. Its poor contact of the battery pack and the circuit board as others stated. I pulled the spring on the tail cap out to put more pressure on the battery holder..This works for a while but the spring eventually looses strength. When it works its great but even at the cheap price I expect it to just turn on..I am sending it back for replacement but have a feeling the new one will be the same way..If it is I will just get creative and figure out a way to get it working...I saw a post somewhere where a person soldered a little washer in place and it fixed the problem. This flashlight has the potential to be a 5 but based on my experience and the fact that many others experienced the same problem..there is a design flaw that some of us will experience...I give it a two.
1,Looks nice but works terribly,"I bought one of these for camping and general use. It has a very poor build quality and I often need to shake it to get it to work. This flashlight is absolutely unreliable and the amount of light it puts out is extremely dim. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I at least expected it to work. If you're considering this light versus a slightly more expensive and perhaps US made light (mag), do yourself a favor and spend the extra money. You won't be fumbling around in the dark cursing the horrible engineering that went into building this terrible device."
2,You get what you pay for,"I think the item would be great if the top of my flashlight did not come loose. There is nothing to hold the top lens and led light assembly. This is a big oversight in the product design. That is why everyone is complaining about the item working intermittenly. My item arrived without batteries, and one of the battery spring (internal) was defective and not fixable. The light was extreemly strong and the product seemed promising but it only lasted a couple of minutes."
2,I didn't like it personally,"This is again a cheap material, from China (obviously). The light beam is dull. The battery assembly inside is loose and not fitting well, so the light goes off & on its own. The beam is scattered. You will expect to see everything you don't want it on a good flash light.9 LED or 12 LED... doesn't matter, it is not good. I would recommend to shop around for a good 3W / 5W LED light rather than this one.."
2,Fragile Product,"I was very unimpressed by the durability of this flashlight. I turned it on once and it was fairly bright but as I was trying to clip it to my key chain, I dropped it on a hard, carpeted surface and it broke, failing to turn on afterwards. It was cheap but I'm still disappointed."
1,Junk,"I figured I would give it a try for the price. My mistake, it stopped working after the third time I turned it on. Had it less than 6 hours. Save your money."
1,"Low price, low quality, didnt work.","Nice, but will not stay on, it flashes the LEDs when you shake it, I suppose it has a small short circuit. For the price its not even worth the hassle of returning it."
1,Don't buy!!!,Had flashlight for 2 weeks and dropped it in the snow. Now it only works once in a while...if you shake it!!!
2,"Piece of Junk, buy something else...","When I first got this little flashlight I thought it was great. Then in less than a month, with low usage, started to turn itself off repeatedly. Now is more like a portable strobe light. Buy something else.. I know I have to..."
4,Good little flashlight.,No -- it is not a major brand. But I have found it to be a tough little flashlight with a bright beam. Size is handy. I bought another one.
3,Ok,"Bought 3 of these at five bucks each about a month ago. The brightness is beautiful, plus they are compact & lightweight. The only downside is that the instructions suggest washing your hands after each use because of lead. Bummer."
1,Don't buy this item,"This item was so poorly made, it only worked for me one time. Don't buy this product, unless you are enjoy throwing money away."
5,Good flashlight,"I've had no problems so far with this little light. It's bright and neat looking, and for $5 and free shipping I'm definitely not complaining."
3,LED Flashlight,"Inexpensive and works accordingly. Frequently have to play with it to get to work. When it does work, it provides a bright light. You get what you pay for. Product arrived on time and as described."
4,Good light,"Light is bright, though compact, not heavy easy to use and carry and uses easy to find and replace batteries."
5,Super-Bright Is Right,"These super small, but super-bright lights pack a lot of light. I keep one in the car for emergencies and used it to change my tire late one night. Gave me all the light I needed and then some."
1,Terrible product,Threads on end cap were marred preveventing allignmnet of cap - unable to screw the cap on so product useless at this time. Would like to be offerred a replacemnet for free . . . we'll see.
3,Light works for 2 days and that's it,"This light is very bright considering its size. However after two days of moderate usage, the flashlight died. I placed new batteries, but it failed to turn on. I hope it is a minor or a faulty item I got."
4,BEAUTIFUL GIFT ITEM,"THIS ITEM IS FINE, VERY BRIGHT AND IDEAL AS A GIFT ITEM. MINE IS SLIGHTLY SILVER COLORED, A BIT OFF FROM WHAT IS ONLINE.IT HAS A DRUM THAT TAKES THREE BATTERIES. IF YOU FIX THE DRUM WRONGLY(INVERT POLARITY), IT`S NOT GONNA WORK. RECOMMENDED!.OBIEFUNA, JOE"
2,Very Cheap,"I got this flashflight to leave in my car in the case of an emergency. I liked it because it was small and relatively cheap. Well I left in the car for about a month, until one day when i actually needed to use it, and it didnt work.Turns out that the batteries that came with the flashflight exploded inside the flash light and leaked acid everywhere, ruing the flashlight. This may be my fault for not using better name brand batteries, but i've never had this happen with any other batteries that come with a cheap product before.When the flashlight did work, I would only rate it as a 3 star flashlight. It feels very cheap as if it's not made of anything other than plastic, and it wasn't nearly as bright as I would have hoped. I would recommend spending a few dollars more on a nice flashlight and forgo the headache of this one not working when you need it to."
3,Little Flashlight,Came on time. Was smaller than I thought and have not had a chance to use it. Seems okay though
2,Flashlight,"I was ready to send the flashlight back because it wasn't really a bright light. I checked the batteries and found they were dead. I changed the batteries and it does shine a bright light. But, it doesn't totally shut off. I have to unscrew the back of the flash light and store it like that so the batteries don't run out before I need it again. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Fine backup light,"This light worked as described. It's not very bright, but for the price works quite well, and met my expectation. I didn't have any issues with it functioning and will keep in the car ""just in case"""
4,overall good,"Bought 3 of these flashlights in different colors. One of the units, the cool blue one, first started showing intermittent lighting, then died. After pushing on the glass face of the flashlight, the light came back on, but soon went away. After a few more tries pushing on the glass face, the light came back on, hopefully to stay. To ensure that it stays operational, I've added superglue to make sure the glass does not shift out the millimeter or two that seems to kill the flashlight. Still decided to give it 4 stars because for the price it does give out decent light to use on camping trips, and battery life has been good though I have not timed it. Also, to be fair, it did take some abuse from my son, and I don't really expect a low priced flashlight to handle too much abuse."
4,"It works well, no abilty to adjust light",I had no idea that my local drug store has similar flash lights available in many different colors Two for $10.Works very well and I would rate it five stars if it had adjustable light stream.
4,It's been a great flashlight...,"It's been a great flashlight. I've had this for about a year and a half now and it still works like new.The only down-side to it is the non-adjustable beam. The fixed beam is a little bit wider than I would like, but the flashlight has been a champ as far as everything else goes. The LED's all still work, I've never had the lights in it flicker due to a bad connection, switch still gives a positive click, etc..I don't foresee having any troubles with this light in the near future."
1,Don't waste your time,"This flashlight died shortly after arrival. It was not worth trying to return it.Costco has a great 3-light package of small, black LED flashlights that I purchased after tossing this one."
1,Don't buy; poor quality,"I bought two of these, both broke within a month. They stopped working (and the power button is a very flimsy apparatus)."
1,Warning,"Warning label on this product:""Always wear ANSI approved safety goggles when using this product ... Normal everyday use of this product is likely to expose the user to dust and microscopic particles containing lead and other chemicals known in the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm. Always wear the appropriate clothing and safety equipment when operating this product. Wash hand thoroughly after the use and handling of this product.""I bought two of these for my niece and nephew for Christmas, only to discover today (Christmas) this alarming warning."
1,DOA,"I buy from Amazon on a constant basis. Good prices and good service. This light, on the other hand did not work from the word go. I am returning it.Peter Aldin."
1,Poor Quality,"I thought these were the perfect little lights, I bought 4 of them and every single one developed a loose connection within a couple of months. I tried to fix it by making the connection tighter, but every attempt resulted in failure. These lights went off and on constantly and had to be thrown away."
1,low price - you get what you pay for,Nice light; when it actually goes on. you need to keep shaking or tapping it to keep it on. Shoddy quality.
3,Great price. Average quality.,"After one too many of my other flashlights were taken apart by my kids, I thought this would be a low-cost alternative. Price was right, but I was hoping for slightly better quality. The brightness of the flashlight met my expectations but I experienced the flicker that other reviewers have mentioned. The flashlight drops in and out just often enough that I am not comfortable relying on the light. Do I feel rooked? Not really, it was only $5. But this is not a steal. This one gets filed in the category of you get what you pay for."
2,One out two,"Purchased two. One worked, one didn't. That's about par for the course in China. Not worth the effort to return."
4,Great little flashlight for the price,"This flashlight is Supa' bright for 5 bones. It isn't one that you will use if you constantly need a flashlight, but a back up once a week type thing its perfect."
4,impressive,"I found this flashlight at the bottom of a bilge, soaked in oil. It dropped 5' before finding it's home. It was hard to clean out and there was a little rust but it works as if it were brand new. I'd buy one if I didn't get this as a freebie."
4,Super bright LED flashlight,"Lives up to its name. It is super bright, even though it is a convenient small size."
4,BRIGHT LIGHT!,"ALONG W/MY PEPPERSPRAY I HAVE THIS IN MY PURSE B/C THE BLOCK I LIVE ON [IN BKLYN, NY] IS VERY DARK! ITS BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME...LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT!!"
4,Decent,"I would not say this is super bright, but still think it is a good price for a decent small flashlight"
3,Great........when it works,"I bought 3 of these things. Gave one away. Why not, they are so cheap for 9 LED's in one light? What a bargain.........That is until you have to give the thing a whack every few seconds because there is a loose connection.The concept is great and the exterior construction is nice and rugged, but the execution in making these things is poor."
3,Good Services,"It's great tool and very useful but it has intermittent contacts , Often needed to shake after turn it ON ."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I have had this flashlight for over a year now, and it isn't anything special. The main issue I have with it is that the front lens seems to have been made to pop out, which it does rather easily, especially when the flashlight is accidentally dropped. The challenge then becomes finding the transparent inch wide piece of plastic, often in the dark. I would definitely suggest looking for a higher quality flashlight."
1,Doesn't work!,"Like a fool, I got at least 2 or 3 of these at home. After owning it for a couple weeks, it doesn't work anymore. What a waste of money!"
4,Ted Bell- Hawke,"Really enjoyed the book. This is the first in a serieswith a central character. I always describe Hawke as a"" rich Mitch Rapp"". Ted Bell writes a good thriller."
3,nice light,"the light per se is really bright, but the strap came broken so I cannot hang it as I wished I could"
1,Defective right out of the package,"Nice idea for a cheap, light weight flashlight, but very poorly made. The light flashes on/off randomly. It will turn on sometime with the switch, at other times it must be lightly tapped or shaken, and sometimes nothing. It is essentially useless. It is most definitely NOT ""Heavy Duty"" as the description says. I liked the size and price, but this is just a piece of junk. I am returning it. Save yourself some aggravation, pay a few bucks more, get a name brand."
2,"Good price, bad switch","I bought several of these b/c the price was so good and the light so bright. Most of the lights I bought flicker a lot, with the light sometimes going out. Seems to be due to the wiring in the switch area, since tapping and turning it on & off temporarily resolves the problem (for about a minute)."
1,Defective,"I thought I would take a chance and get one that doesn't have the spotty on/off problem so many others have reported. No such luck. It doesn't turn on when you click it. If you reseat the battery, or jiggle it around, it will eventually turn on and work, but when you need a flashlight, you need a flashlight, not one five minutes later.A consistent design flaw or poor construction process.On the plus side, it looks great, and when it works, it works well. I gave it to my 4-year old and bought a Smith and Wesson 28 light LED flashlight."
1,back to back faults,The flashlight was delivered in a timely fashon but didn't work. The included batteries worked fine but no light. Amazon won't replace the light because they are not the seller. All I get is a refund. When that comes through I'll decide if it's worth the hassle to try again.
2,"Looks nice, but didn't work.","I bought this flashlight as a replacement for my other broken one. I bought it mainly because of its small size and price. I would have loved it if it worked, but the first time I took it out of it's packaging it wouldn't even turn on. I opened it up and looked at it but everything looked fine. I twisted the cap back on and gave it a light tap and it turned on.I figured it was good to go and let it sit. A couple weeks later I came back to it and tried to turn it on again. Well needless to say it didn't, even after trying anything I could think of to turn it on. It's a nice looking product, but one that I won't be buying in the future."
1,Not Happy,Neiko Super-Bright 9 LED Heavy-Duty Compact Aluminum Flashlight - Gunmetal SilverThis item literally fell apart after 2 DAYS and after using only 3 times !
1,I ordered the lamp and it doesnt work,"Ok it's cheap but who cares if it does not work? I have to screw it so many times, to hit it and then the light turns on but it blinks..."
5,led light small,This little Led light has some serious out put of light. I recommend this to anyone that needs bright light. Small enough to carry in your pocket or ladies purse.
4,Good Flashlight -- Great Price,This is a nice LED flashlight for the price (I paid $5). I have more expensive (>$30) flashlights that are sturdier and brighter. This flashlight is adequate for my use which is typically camping and its cheap enough that I don't worry about losing it.
2,Quality is poor,"This flashlight was great, while it worked. After a few months, the switch became tricky to use - sometimes it would light, sometimes not; sometimes while I was outside in the dark, the light would go out suddenly & I'd have to jiggle the housing around to get it to light again. Even then, the lighting was inconsistent. When I opened it to try to fix it, the spring popped out & I was unable to insert it again - it was too far down in the flashlight to reach, even with needlenose pliers. You get what you pay for. For $5, it seems like a good deal, but I'd rather have a heavy-duty, reliable flashlight."
2,Read the warning label,"I bought this as a gift and the warnings on the label were ridiculous. If you use this flashlight while you are pregnant, there's a risk of birth defects! You should also operate it using safety gloves! There were other warnings that I can't remember, but clearly this product isn't terribly safe. If you don't mind the risks and plan on using safety gloves, I'm sure it provides light adequately."
2,bright light light,"it's a good, bright light, but it's too light-weight for my taste. Feels cheaply made. As long as it's not damaged by dropping or something it's got a good light, though."
2,the rubbish bin,"You're better off using a torch with real fire for extended night time use, might last longer as well. I tossed this in the rubbish bin after about 2 weeks of flimsy use."
3,not as bright as other 9-led lights,"Two things bothered me about this purchase. First, this light was advertised as a ""buy together"" with another similar light that qualified for free shipping under Amazon prime. But this light does not qualify for that since it's from another vendor, so I ended up paying about twice as much as I thought. Second, it is not as bright as the other similarly styled and priced cool blue or black flashlights I have bought from Amazon. The batteries are toss-out quality. Seems brighter with better quality batteries.Still, it's a good light for the car, taking very little space and fitting in tight glove comprtments with ease."
3,Not as Expected,"It is not the one I expected. Picture shows a bigger size, actual size is very small and not bright as expected. I got a free flash light with Gillette Mach3 which has focus adjustment , we can adjust and point the beam, so bright and bigger than this. It looks like a poor quality flash light."
2,Junky flashlight quality,"I purchased two of these flashlights, one promptly broke within a week.Pros: CheapCons: Unreliable and not durable. This is NOT a flashlight to rely on for important situations."
2,Worked well for a month,"Nice flashlight at a low price. *However*, the honeymoon is over after a month. Mine, like others who have reviewed it, stopped working after a month. First it starts to flicker on and off, then it stops working entirely.Think of it as a disposable product only. If you want quality get a Mag-Lite."
2,Danger Danger Danger,"Aside from the disconcerting warning on the package about dangerous chemicals shed by the item, this flash light will leave you high and dry. I learned recently on a camping trip.Went camping with friends in the Sierra's near South Lake Tahoe. I left my friends and campsite one night to climb a nearby mountain for some star gazing around 2am. (a meteor shower was occurring) Just as I reached a clearing on top of a large rock mountain, the flashlight lens popped off and all internal contents spilled out. It was pitch dark. I fumbled with trying to find the pieces of flashlight- failed. It was too dangerous to try to climb down in the dark. Instead of yelling for help and embarrassing myself, I hunkered down near a tree until morning, freezing my rear off, despite three heavy REI coats.In an emergency, a quality product is priceless.This product is unworthy. Even for fee I'd not take it."
2,why didn't i buy a mini-mag?,"if you're looking to fill that $$$ quota to meet the free shipping and handling from amazon, then why not. buy it and give it as a gift, or leave it in the car.if you're buying to because you NEED a flashlight... move along."
2,works part of the time,"I bought several of these and open one and played with it and found it works part of the time. You have to tap it to get it to work, or open the battery cap and then put it back on to get it to work. LED's are bright but thats no good if you can't get them to work. I returned all lights"
1,Flaky switch.,"Yes, as with several other reviewers - the switch on my flashlight is flaky. It suddenly dims all by itself. Hard to recommend purchase. Oh well, at least it was cheap."
3,it's a flashlight,"The LED light is bright white but sometimes makes it hard to see. I use it when I work on my car and seeing into those small spaces with this flashlight is hard at times. It is a nice flashlight and it is very handy; however, sometimes it dims for no reason as if it is getting less power from the batteries but then when I shake it the light gets bright again. That might be specific to my flashlight though. Overall, this flashlight is a decent flashlight. It deserves 3 stars because there is nothing really wrong with it but it doesn't get four or five stars because it isn't above average or an exceptional flashlight."
5,Great,These little flashlights are well made; very bright and a superb product. I liked them so well I bought 20 for gifts.
5,"Excellent quality, excellent price","As buyers before me have mentioned, the price is cheap; the quality is anything but cheap.Old light blub flashlights give dim and yucky yellow light. They also drain batteries quickly - or use large, bulky one. With white LEDs, all these problems are solved: they inherently produce white light (although a bit on the bluish side), and they draw much less power. Therefore it becomes possible to have long-lasting yet high-powered flashlights using only AAA batteries!So I bought a bunch of these to replace my old flashlights and as gifts for friends. The light output is fantastic, and the metal casing is solid and very professional-looking.You will not be disappointed. This may be the best flashlight you'll ever see."
2,Hard to keep lit,"It was only $5, so I didn't expect too much, but this thing is TINY. I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the dimensions given, but I really didn't expect it to be so small. It's almost keychain small, but the light is nice and bright.Problem is, there seems to be a bad connection between screw on top and battery which makes keeping the light lit difficult unless you press hard on the button the whole time. So, overall, I wouldn't recommend this one and think you could probably find a tiny, cheap flashlight at WalMart or a dollar store that would work better for less money."
5,"Compact, bright, and sturdy","This is a great little flashlight. The LEDs are extremely bright and provide good illumination over at least 30 feet. As with other LED flashlights, you cannot adjust the focal distance, so you cannot produce a bright spot or flood, but the illumination provided by the LEDs is sufficient for most tasks.Regarding durability, the flashlight feels light but solid in my hand, and I have had no problems with flickering or faulty contacts. (Note: I have not put this flashlight through heavy-duty use)."
5,Great value and great filler item :P,"I bought this just so i could meet the $25 free ship thing, but I like the flashlight very much. Its compact and gives off a nice bright white light. Prefer to use over my mini-mag for everyday use. Not sure how rugged this is and would still trust the mag over this for quality, but this is certainly worth the $$."
4,They Work!,"Surprisingly decent quality for the price. I was expecting cheap hollow plastic / metal, but the flashlight actually feels good in the hand and provides decent light. Going to keep them around the house and car for emergencies."
4,My flash light,"Small but powerful, of great help when I have to walk on the dark road. Since it is so small, it can be put in my pocket easily.I like it."
2,an ok little light when it works. chinsy.,"Not ""heavy duty"", not even a little. After a couple weeks of light use (ha ha), the button that turns it on & off is already going sketchy. It's pretty bright when I can get it to go on as bright as it goes, but the aforementioned sketchy switch prevents that sometimes and it just barely flickers on. Not impressed, even for the low price."
2,Flashlight,"It is a very bright flashlight, however I did not consider it heavy duty. I purchased four, for the most part they were all working just fine. After a while some would go dim with the slightist tap."
4,Pretty Good Deal,"I purchased three of these to use at trade shows for showing off the products under a good, bright light. I'd have to say the lights are well worth the few dollars I paid for them. They were listed as an ""add-on"" item so I didn't have to pay for any shipping!. I've read reviews on these lights that said the contact for the batteries wasn't very good but I haven't seen any problems like that. I'd recommend these lights to anyone who just needs a small but bright light. Know that these lights will do the job but they aren't as powerful as some other similar products. In other words, I probably wouldn't recommend this light to someone who needs to illuminate a large dark space. They are more suited for lighting a small area like a closet or small bedroom. For my purposes of showing details of products, they work great!"
3,nice cheap light,bright for size and cost.....waterproof.....dropped in mud-pool....washed it....still working....light-weight....but ....you can get the similar (non-branded of-course) light for 1 USD approx.I would recommend this light for regular home use only.
1,don't keep it in your car,"I got this to keep in my car, and after a few weeks it no longer worked. Presumably the motion of the car messed up comething inside the flashlight. They advertise it as being good for keeping in a car, which is NOT TRUE. Maybe it's ok if you ust use it in your house."
2,i though it would be better,"as a huge Stone Roses fan, believe me i wanted to like this album. and i do dig John's guitar work and song structures, it's just his vocal stylings that i can't get into. as someone who is so softspoken its hard for me to believe that that's actually John singing. and i have nothing against croaking type of vocals. i'm a big Dinosaur Jr. fan. but what worked for J. Mascis, does'nt work for John unfortunately. i had hoped that ""time would change everything"" this time around, but that album's vocals and this one's are virtually the same. that being said ""Cape Cod Morning"" and ""Gas"" are quite good and deserve a listen. where's Reni??"
3,Could have been a great album.,"So close... Great songs, impressively played - could have been as good as the Seahorses album. He's written a wonderful bunch of songs, much better than his first solo album. But I wish he had not sung them. Even though the vocals are thankfully mixed way down, the painful rattle of Squire's voice kills the songs he has put so much work into. He should have asked someone else to sing them. Anyone. Because, sadly, for all his incredible musical talent, almost anyone in the world can sing better than him.What a shame, and a waste of good music."
4,great product no DVD,If you are consistant the pilates circles deliver results. Disappointed that the kit does not include a DVD -- only comes with a video.
2,Gaiam Pilates Bodycircles Workout = bad audio sound!,"The bodycircles workout is superb! I am having challenges with ""tennis elbow"" and stiffness in the cervical/thoracic area, and this workout is the answer! I use it to alleviate stiffness, as my own complimentary medicine for physical therapy."
4,Great for quick arm workouts!,"I read about these pilates body circles in a UK version of Modern Bride - so i was really excited to see them for sale in the US. They're great for a quick arm workout (5 mins a day), and they're a lot more challenging than they look! I found it challenging to keep the circles going on my wrists though - they seem to ride up the arms. I'm sure practice makes perfect!"
1,Understatement on Accompanying VHS,"The exercises are effective however the VHS is in a word cheap - mine is defective (won't go thru the hassle of trying for another). The audio goes in and out which is extremely annoying. I put up with it because the rings are a solid workout. Be prepared for complete annoyance until you can memorize the tape (hello - we're in the DVD world now), mute the audio and play a CD instead.Gaim should have more respect since they're pitching 'CALM'."
3,good!,oh yes...this album would be good if i could actually understand what they were saying...mmm u guys say its very violent...mmm i better not show my german teacher this band....she'll get pissed off...shes seriously off her nutter
1,More of the Same!,"Of course these women are perfect, anyone would be with gads of body makeup and the help of a great airbrush artist. This is what makes it a Fantasy, not reality - It's getting OLD, or maybe I am??? I am sorry if I sound old fashioned, but my wife is reality, flaws and all and I would much rather look at her than implants, airbrushed and made up Photos - Honestly, they turn me OFF. Sports are my Thing, but I wish I didn't receive this issue, it should be a special issue for men who need that sort of thing, I do not."
1,What year is this?,"I could not agree more with the reviewer who commented on the lack of black women on this cover. It is really insulting considering that a large portion of the athletes covered in SI are black. I don't care what country she comes from, but there should be at least one black woman on the cover. What about Asian women? There are people out here who find black and Asian women attractive. Six blonde white models and two dark-haired Latinas is not my idea of diversity. SI should be ashamed of themselves. That cover does not reflect the world that we live in. Beautiful women come in all colors."
1,The Reason Why It's the Top Selling Issue,"The reason why it's the top-selling issue is because it's porn. Duh. Except that it doesn't have to have the black plastic around it, any kid can pick it up and marvel at completely naked women - except that their skin is a color other than a flesh tone because they're ""painted"". I'm sorry, but some of us like to stay faithful to one woman and not have to see just-a-smidge-away-from-nudity all the time."
3,What that HOPLA all about,"What is that HOPLA all about? --Really, there is no much more apart from half naked bodies! Nice, but what else is in there? -- Much ado about nothing..."
1,Spank these bad boys down and they keep popping up!,"By now, anyone who is reviewing the work published via the Discovery Institute ought to realize we're dealing with a slick PR agency and not a scientific research organization. This book is a weak attempt to throw a little water on the fire that's been burning in the ID/Creationist camp since Judge Jones made his eloquent and legally astute decision in the celebrated Kitzmiller v. Dover case.Those readers with any degree of intellectual honesty will take this book and contrast it with actual testimony from the trial before jumping into the flames. It's available in pdf form online. There are also several books including ""Monkey Girl"" and ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" that present a more unbiased, journalistic viewpoint."
1,Hogwash,"As someone else has written, this is a waste of money no matter how you believe, as all of this slanted tripe is available for free."
4,This book is mostly about the legal aspects...,"I read the book. It is a quick, but interesting overview of the legal aspects of the Dover case. It is not about the evidence for or against Intelligent Design as a scientific theory.I'd love to see a critique of the actual book by someone who disagrees with it."
3,Good Translation,Since I am new to Islam I thought by reading this book I would open myself up to the illustrious meaning of the Qur'an. But I found my self wondering what I was reading. The translation in this book was not as awe inspiring as I had hoped it would be. So I went out and purchased a more recent translation by Ali and I loved it 25 times over this one.Asalamu Alaikum
3,Short-lived fun,"Assembly of this game the first time takes only a minute or two. Playing the game took my 6-year-old a few seconds. Only three or four wet marbles placed on the tissue breaks it. When my son attempts to put a new tissue in place himself, it nearly always rips a little, so he becomes frustrated. He did find the game interesting at first, and was fascinated by the concept of water making paper easier to break."

2,"NOW, THIS IS WHERE MORE ACTION COULD'VE DEFINITELY HELPED","POPEYE DOYLE [GENE HACKMAN] IS BACK ONCE AGAIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH A DRUG RUNNER IN FRANCE, SINCE HE FAILED TO CATCH HIM BEFORE IN NEW YORK. SUB-PAR STORY AND WHERE THE SLOW PACE AND THE BUILDING TO THE FINALE ACTUALLY HELPED THE ORIGINAL, IT NEARLY RUINS THE SEQUEL! OF COURSE, THE FIRST FILM DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH ACTION, BUT, I BELIEVE THAT IF THIS SEQUEL HAD MORE ACTION, THIS COULD'VE BEEN SAVED FROM BEING MEDIOCRE. ONLY THING BENEFITTING THIS ONE IS GENE HACKMAN. OTHER THAN HIM, THERE'S REALLY NOT TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING TO SEE IN THIS SEQUEL TO THE ALL-TIME CLASSIC ORIGINAL. STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL FOR MUCH BETTER RESULTS."
1,Camera Shake,"Due to the severe camera shake I can only give this one star. I had to look away several times to avoid getting dizzy. Gene Hackman, as always, did a great job."
2,Its alright,"It has beads in it so I am guessing it's doing something; I really don't see any difference from when I just use my bath poof. I also did not feel some great difference in my skin as I have with some other products. I am NOT a fan of the smell. I have smelled worst products but this is not even in my top 50 good smelling products, I cringe a little each time I use this product (Seeing as how I spent $14.50 on it, I am not going to just toss it)*I debating giving it 2 stars (I don't like it) and 3 stars (It's okay) I wish I could give it 2.5 because I don't like it but I would imagine it would be okay for some people, I may even think it was okay if not for the smell."
3,Book purchase,"I found what I wanted. However, the description was vague and I thought I was buying a hardback. At $28.++ , one would think it was hardback. That was my only disappointment. The book, itself, is very good."
2,Nothing new,"On the plus side, Davis is a very good writer and his books are always highly readable. This book is also a good political history of the CSA, although it often focuses too much on certain individuals. The reason I give this book just two stars is because while Davis would have you believe that his book is a new look at the Confederacy, this is really just a regurgitation of Emory Thomas' The Confederate Nation. Davis' book may be more mass market friendly and less academic than Thomas', but Davis' book makes all the same points Thomas' book made back in 1979. Both are worth reading, but know that Davis is not breaking any new ground and I'd say Thomas' work is the better of the two."
2,Bland overview of CSA,"Davis has done better. Although a thematic, rather than chronological, approach can work in general histories like this, it doesn't work here. There's a lot of jumping around and a lack of coherency at times. Also, Davis used 1/4th of the book just to get to Lincoln's First Inagural. Davis wrote a good history of the origins of the Confederacy, so I don't see why we need 100 pages of detail on that here.I give it two stars because there's always something to learn from a fine researcher. This one was a big disappointment, though."
3,Detailed socio-political history,"This book is a must-read for so many of those who unthinkingly display the Confederate flag. I picked up this book figuring that there must be some positive reforms that came out of the Confederacy, but as Davis tells it, the founders were selfish hypocritical rationalizers. The Confederacy really was all about instituting a class of aristocrats to rule over the poor whites and oppressing the blacks. The book is at its best when it deals with race issues, and the incredible lengths Confederates would go to justify their ""peculiar institution"". Despite their protests to the contrary, ultimately the South was fighting for principles that were unworkable, untenable, and even immoral, and so their cause was doomed from the start."
1,History Flip Flop,"I am confused on what is true history in our Country . I read Mr. Davis book ""A Government of our Own"" about the Confederacy written in 1994 and he gave a very pleasant and interesting view of the Government and how it was formed . After reading ""Look Away"" it was almost as if the NAACP was the Co Author . I have never read such a scornfull and dark book of the people of the South and the Confederacy in my life. What changed Mr. Davis mind since 1994 ? Did History change since then , or is it more politically correct to trash all things Southern now . It makes me wonder about other so called Historians and how much we really know about our past ."
2,very flat account...,"I've enjoyed a good many of Mr. Davis' Civil War books, but I was less than impressed with this effort. For one, it is more of a political history of sorts - little mention of battles or military intrigues for example. An opening section concerning the ""founding fathers-like"" atmosphere of the Montgomery sessions was of interest, but thereafter the text mires in tedium. Davis seems merely to dwell on the negative back-biting political skirmishes of the important personages of the times - Wigfall, Toombs, Rhett, et al. Perhaps a better title would have been ""A History of DISSENT Within the Confederate States"". I will certainly be very wary of any future work done by Mr. Davis.There was very little I learned reading this book."
1,"Lots of one-sided political philosopy, very little history",This book is simply ham-handed political propaganda masquerading as history. Much of the space is spent indulging the author's rather naive philosophies while making only token attempts to justify projecting those philosophies upon the people and states described.
3,Mostly Political,It is a good book with a pretty general overview of the history of modern Germany. Pretty much skims over early history boiling it down to a political history. The book should be double the length and have more events and people.
2,Very boring and sometimes too philosophycal,Definitely not the best book. It's difficult to follow the narration because it's chaotic sometimes with lots of personal thoughts and opinions. Often just boring. Very disappointed.
2,FAIR HISTORICAL APPROACH,"The book is a fair representation of actual events. Not excellent, but fair! Too much interference from the run-of-the-mill European opinions rather than hard facts (in many instances)"
5,Esthero!,I saw her live and I was an instant fan of her music! The production and the writing is so smooth and deep feeling! The bass hits me in the heart! It's a good feeling!
5,This CD is BANGIN'!!!,"Breath From Another, That Girl, Superheroes, these are my favorites. The other tracks definitely work as well. I have heard a lot of garbage as of late and I am so glad I saw the video to ""That Girl"" on MTV's 120 Minutes that sunday. You want real music go and get this."
4,Hip-Hop & Jazz: A great combination,"I was turned on to Esthero when I recently visited Vancouver & heard ""That Girl."" It's very rare I buy a CD off the strength of one cut, but I made an exception in this case and have not regretted it. The music is imaginative & the vocals are almost mystical. This CD reminds me of some of Swing Out Sister's work, but edgier. It's sinful this CD isn't getting any play in the States, because it's definitely a step above many of the CDs out now."
5,I don't know what to say...,"EXCEPT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TRIP-HOP/ACID JAZZ ALBUMS EVER!!!!! not only is one of the best in both those genres of music, but it is one of the best cds EVER!!! the music is so, i don't know, ehtereal!!! i mean, this is a cd you can put on repeat and not get tired of it at all!!! Esthero's voice is so amazing, a sort of Bjork-meets-Nelly Furtado thing, so amazingly beautiful!!! And the music is purely unreal! it seems really futurisitc and contemporary, but still keeps and 90's feel to it!! i can't tell you how much i love this cd!!! if you're curious about ESTHERO, you really should (aka ""have to"") buy this cd. it is definitley worth the money!!!"
4,A Great CD,"This CD has a mix of Soul, Electronic Bass, Acid Jazz and Hip-Hop. I picked this one up because of tracks #1 ""Breath From Another"", #9 ""Superheros"" and #5 ""Country Living (The World I Know)"". Even though it was a let down to hear a different version of ""Country Living(The World I know)"", I was still pleased with the over all content of this CD. From the great production to the smooth high alto voice of the lead voaclist, this CD is well put together and was a great buy. There is also an exrta treat to hear two hidden tracks at the end of this CD.oNe"
5,Still Among My Favorites,"11 years after I first discovered this album, it still remains among my favorite albums of all time. Esthero's voice is second to none (my favorite female artist). A month doesn't go by that I get the urge to listen to this album on repeat for days on end. I first discovered her through the movie SLAM, in which she lent her chorus to a Goodie Mob song ""The World I Know."" If you have yet to give this album a try - do so immediately, you won't regret it."
5,Great friggin' album!!!,"not much I can say that hasn't already been said. This is one of my favorite records...and the last song ""Swallow Me"", is up there with ""Wish you were here"" in the way it make you feel after listening to it...great album!"
4,Some great grooves-- lacks originality.,"This CD has many moments in which you just think, ""this is EXACTLY what music is supposed to be."" But those are moments. Too often Esthero seems to ride the wave that brought MONO and PORTISEHEAD into the limelight and produces depressing, emotionless dribble. I would DEFINITELY reccomend the CD, but I think it has room for improvement."
5,Excellent,"This album is probably one of my all time favourites. The hip-hop, downtempo influences, along with Estheros distinctive lyrics and vocals make this a album a secret treasure is the States. Anyone who owns this album should be considered fortunate."
4,"the world i know, was boring (musically) before esthero","So as usual i browse listening stations for potential new cds, and i see esthero, and remember they were on my list of stuff to potentially check out after that time article..... so i listened and fell in love with her voice. is it just me or was there just something really familiar about the world i know. well it is a great blend, perfect for relaxing, napping and escaping. esthero has a beautiful voice, and they are extremely creative. She strays away from vocal gymnastics and lets her real vocal shine through. i wish everyone would check it out, and it looks like they might with the that girl video on mtv."
3,"Okay, but...","This CD is okay, but it really doesn't flow well. The music seems allover the place without really peaking your interest in any way. I like her vocals, but I think she can do alot better than this.Actually listen to her collaboration with the Black-eyed Peas (Weekend) and I think you get a better feel of what her talent is capable of.Of course, this is only MY opinion here.Take a chance if you dare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,...read on...,"maybe I'm exagerating by giving this album only 1 star, but it's only to bring the average down from an unrealistic 4 1/2 stars. The most I would give this album would be 2 1/2. While Esthero's debut ""Breath From Another"" has a sort of behemoth charm with songs like ""that girl"" and ""heaven sent"", it is entirely too pretentious for my liking. And on another note, I would consider it an injustice to compare Esther's voice with Björks, Beth Gibbons, and/or Billie Holiday."
1,Check out the lyrics,"Looks like no one thinks this is helpful.I just wish someone would have warned me before I bought this CD. Your killing the messenger!The lyrics are easily available on the web.`Breath From Another'you sure do got a pretty mouthWhy don't you drop my pants i'll make you squeal like a pig`Heaven Sent'Couldn't wait to get your clothes onWell, i guess we didn't have to kill herBut don't feel so bad thoughYou looked her in the eyeAnd i watched her cryMy mouth went dryAs i watched her cryEveryone has to, gets to dieBut not on my time - not on this girl's timeF***** if it's my time (f***** if it's my time)Not on my time(this is all f***** up)"
5,Extrordinary,"This album brings much needed(and appreciated )breath of life into popular music. The lyrics are striking, and vocalist Esthero has a beautiful and haunting voice. Breathe From Another is one the best albums (and its a debut!) that I have heard in a while."
5,Perfect.,"I first got aquainted with this album when it was released in 98. I loved in then and thought by now I might have outgrown it. But I recently loaded into my ipod and I'm so excited I did! I forgot how much I loved her voice, the lulling sound of the music. It's groovy, funky, very jazzy. I also love the collaboration she did with black eyed peas on one of their earlier albums, bridging the gap. awesome.I haven't gotten her most recent album, but definitely plan to after coming to the realization that I LOVE this album. I don't care if it's different, she's a genius."
5,Not the typical fan of the genre...,I heard of this cd in a random way from a random guy. He played this cd for me and I went home and bought it that very same night! I have one word to describe this experience...and IT IS AN EXPERIENCE...the word is SURREAL!
5,Classic,A must buy. Timeless. This Canadian artist touches many genres and transforms her sound into a trip-hop/rock/r&b/hip-hop sound of its own. It is definitely worth the journey.
2,Horrible audio,This album has some interesting moments but is poorly mixed and sounds annoyingly thin and scratchy. I suggest In The Land of Grey and Pink is a better choice.
3,Caravan - If I Could Do It All Over Again I'd Do It,"This CD shows is harder to accept than the first, but it's still good. This is the mark of the Caravan, quiet songs, but more introspective, psychedelic. Would not recommend as a first disc to buy, but not to give up when you like progressive rock. The remastered version is good with interesting bonuses. Rating: 6.5 (maximum)."
5,Tuscany,"Andre Rieu is a great performer. I saw him perform at the Cumberland Civic Center in Portland, Maine about two years ago. I saw him on PBS just recently coming from Tuscany. He has a very good selection of music on this CD. If you like Andre Rieu, this is a must to add to your collection."
5,Outstanding!,"I don't remember having such a reaction to an orchestra. I get tears everytime I watch this. Andre Rieu puts joy, passion, romance and humor into some beautiful music. Andre has a gift. The Italian National Anthem is a wonderful song, first time I've heard it and the tune is staying in my head. It's lovely. I want to share this DVD with everyone because who could not find it moving and a joy to experience. Want the entire Andre collection now. Bravo, Andre!"
4,STEREO VS 5.1,My 6th dvd by Andre. I have to say it would be my favorite except for the fading in and out of the 5.1 soundtrack. The sound was so bad that I actually bought another copy of the dvd from another source to be sure it wasn't my system. It wasn't. I then chose the stereo option from the dvd and selected mains and my subwoofer for playback. The sound is now worthy of a 4.0 rating or so. (It still sounds very good) So many good dvds by this man. Such great music. I will hear him next week in Dallas. I am certainly looking forward to it. This dvd is worth buying. Just be aware the 5.1 is not worth listening to.
1,URGENT!,I made the payment of the product have 2 months (04/17/2012) and has not received the product!I await the touch of you URGENT!Grateful.
3,Andre Rieu Tuscany,I was somewhat disappointed in the CD version of Andre Rieu in Tuscany as I also have the dvd and there are a number of songs that were omitted from the cd.
3,Video quality does not match audio,"The music in this DVD is great. The location is beautiful, and it was a great concert. However, the video quality is not very good and detracts greatly from an otherwise terrific concert by Andre Rieu and his orchestra. The picture is quite blurry most of the time. It is especially pronounced during the closed up shots. Too bad Denon cannot keep up the video quality for this DVD. This video pales compared to, say, the DVD for Andrea Bocelli Vivere Live in Tuscany done by Decca."
5,Andre Rieu review,Andre Rieu is excellent in everything I have ever heard him do. What more can I say?
1,I was turned on off by Yanni Liberace,"This guy should change his name to Yanni Liberace He might be a good violinist, but he reminds me of a cheap Elvis impersonator, or some cheap hairdresser who woos female clients. His show is barely Vegas Level,and he's laughing at American's for falling for his warm and fuzzy schlock.Well Andre,I could never convince all your adoring fans that you've lowered the performing arts curve for sure. But your not going to the bank with money.Maybe I'll grow my hair long and talk like Fabio,rent an orchestra,rent a hall,rent some local singers,maybe some costumes,jewelry and a limo."
5,Beautiful Music,"Andre Reiu was someone we had never heard of until a year or so ago when one of his concerts was on public television. My mother was instantly addicted to him and I (43yrs) love him too! His concerts are beautifully done and Andre has a smart alec, but cute, personality and keeps you engaged. A must see!"
4,Andre Rieu - Tuscany cd,"A little disappointing. Seven numbers from the actual concert have been deleted. On the other hand, the music is excellent."
4,Feel good,"Great Atmosphere. You can dive into the beauty of Tuscany accompanied by wonderful music. If you had a bad day, put in the DVD and escape to Happyland."
3,Songs were omitted,"I agree this CD is awesome BUT, and big but here, a LOT of songs on the DVd were omitted here. Especially L'Italiano which is one of my favorites. I have both the DVD and CD. The DVD is much better."
5,This is so much more than the other reviewer implies,"This is such a fantastic book, and I hope people are not misled by the last review. Apart from many factual innaccuracies (Levin and Anna do meet, this is crucial; and Anna and Vronsky can never marry, this is the root of the crisis, etc.), there are too many generalisations placed on Tolstoy's aims.Tolstoy weaves a complicated story, not just a love story but one with great comedy, and deep philosophical issues. We share Tolstoy's own indecisive worries about death, love, politics, and laugh at the faults we see in ourselves and aquaintances. Levin, as a reflection of Tolstoy (Leo's wife once told him, ""you are Levin plus talent, and Levin is an intolerable man""), guides us through most of these issues, but never tells us what to think. We are observers and make our own decisions.This book makes you laugh out loud, cry in pain, and think hard aside from being a compulsive story and a beautiful picture of Tolstoy's Russia."
5,"""Vengeance is mine... and I will repay.""","Isn't it funny how the second part of that statement completely changes the meaning of the first? And that is the way the entire book reads. As soon as you think you have a handle on any of the characters, you learn something new that changes everything. The result is that it's almost impossible to make a judgment about anyone.Anna, in particular, becomes more tragic just for that reason. First we see her as the dutiful, virtuous wife of a passionless man. Then we see her easily corrupted by the decadent Vronsky. How ""good"" was she in the first place if she was such a willing victim? And even though we see in painful detail why she continuously refuses to do the right thing until it's too late, we still find ourselves asking why.Who is avenging themselves on whom, and why? Some of the answers are obvious, but some are unexpected and make the most righteous characters downright malicious, and the most unsympathetic almost pathetic."
3,Anna,"I realize that this is a classic, but it can be slow in places. Half way through it picks up, so don't give up - keep reading."
4,Nice playhouse,"The playhouse was easily assembled, it only took 10 minutes at the most. The house is just about the right size for my 16 month old. Everything works good too. The price was competative but it is just a bunch of plastic. If it was a little more affordable, I would rate it higher with 5 stars. Otherwise, it is a very good purchase."
4,My daughter absolutely loves this!!!!!,"This house is awesome!!!! But, I recommend this for indoor playing because the roof is not really sturdy plastic. My daughter is 14 months. We got it for her 1st birthday. All of her cousins love to come over and play in it. They love the working door bell. Great for the price too. It will last for a long time! Great colors!"
4,play house,"I bought this for my baby that is turning 1 ,and between her and my 4 year old they have a blast playing in it. I love the colors of this too."
3,Ok - but CHEAP!,"I was so excited when I ordered this. But, when I got it I was surprised at how cheap it was. I have many Step 2 products and they are all very durable and well constructed. This product is VERY thin plastic, you have to punch the holes through the plastic to screw the pieces on and then they never tighten because they have nothing to tighten to. My 2 year old LOVES it, especially the doorbell, but given the opportunity, I wouldn't buy it. I am disappointed to have spent $100 on this."
3,"Very small and flimsy, but cute playhouse","This is an adorable playhouse, however I have doubts about it's durablity. It seems very flimsy. It also is very small, maybe 2 toddlers max could fit inside. It is adorable though and has cute features."
5,Play House,My granddaughter loved it. It was easy to put together. It has stood up to the elements out side well.
3,"Good ep, but get the Aus version","The Australian version of this single is the correct one to buy as it has Troubleshooting and I'm Free as the bsides. The UK single has Caravan as the bside and this can already be found on the how we operate single (no doubling up yay). Also I'm free is only found on the UK vinyl otherwise, another bonus to getting the right version.The songs are great, I'm Free, however I'm Free is either free of loudness wars or they forgot to equalise it out at the pressing phase. Troubleshooting is a slow track which is a very nice listen, I'm Free (a stones cover) is done well and the title track is solid. So overall a nice single but nothing spectacular and worth getting as none of these songs are Five Men in a Hut."
5,"Blondie Live (essentially their ""Greatest Hits Live"")","This concert video was recorded in 1983, and features Blondie at their peak. It includes:1. RAPTURE2. ISLAND OF LOST SOULS3. DANCE WAY4. THE TIDE IS HIGH5. HEART OF GLASS6. HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE7. DREAMIN'8. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER9. WAR CHILD10. START ME UP11. CALL ME"
4,Gumball Machine,"My 15 month old son really Loves this toy. His favorite things to play with always involve balls:) It is a very basic toy with little bells and whistles, which is why i chose it. It does'nt require batteries and is'nt deafing to my ears. I would recommend it to anyone with a young child who loves to play with balls."
1,Choking Hazard!!!,"The balls of this toy come apart. My son got half of one ball lodged in his mouth and choked and threw up from it. It was a very scary experience. In my opinion, this toy needs to be recalled."
1,CRACKED ALREADY,I used this every day for about 2 weeks before it cracked up the middle. The plastic material isn't flexible enought for this type of application. It's cheap enough but not durable.
4,BUY THIS CD!,"They're like the Average White Band of the 90s. Soulful grooves, hip lyrics, cool melodies. Awesome album! I'm prety sure they're broken up now but anything they released is worth owning."
4,comfy,"I got this for a running sandal and it's very comfortable - but not for running, for walking. The strap across the top has to be tight enough so the sandal doesn't flap which makes it too tight to run or do sports in. However I would recommend it for golfing, walking, etc. It's also not great looking - it looks like an orthotic shoe."
4,This is a full length movie,One of the few full length movies. It has the full 69 minute run time. The quality is good and I would have given a full five stars except for the RE logo in the bottom right corner all through the movie. For this reason I will give Reel Enterprises a no vote and buy somewhere else.
5,Comments from the Publisher,"We apologize for the inconvenience. The title of the book was corrected on May 10th, 2009, as well as the navigation. This is a single volume not a collection of Jefferson's writings. The collection has much larger volume of Jefferson's worksWorks of Thomas Jefferson. Including The Jefferson Bible, Autobiography and The Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Illustrated), with Notes on Virginia, Parliamentary ... more. Published by MobileReference (mobi)including The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, Volume VI as well as Memoir, Correspondence, And Miscellanies, From The Papers Of Thomas Jefferson"", all 4 volumes with comprehensive index and TOC, State of the Union Addresses of Thomas Jefferson, and more"
2,Be aware of what you're buying,"[NOTE: This review pertains to ""The Writings of Thomas Jefferson ..."" published by MobileReference, ASIN: B001OZ7ZMG.] This is an odd publication. Contrary to what its title implies, and unlike other Mobile Reference collections I've purchased, it is not a complete collection. Nor is it a ""greatest hits"" collection. Rather, it's Jefferson's letters written in the mid-1780s, plus two biographical essays. Thus, while the title doesn't make this clear, it appears to be the digitized version of *one* volume of Jefferson's collected works. (The size of the file would also suggest that we're dealing with something less than the complete works here.)As for ease of use, there are no links to aid navigation within the letters. On the plus side, the price is right."
4,"Not your ususal ""cartoon"" fare...","Imagine if ""Yellow Submarine"" was based on the works of Isaac Asimov instead of Beatles' music, and you'll have a pretty good idea of ""Light Years"" (both films have similar openings, stylistically, and both envision fantastic worlds that make use of the imaginative power of animation).This film is not for everyone (it's a little on the cerebral side), but it's definitely an alternative to the Disney-clones and the ultraviolent manga (both of which are often good, but it's a pleasure to see something different).""Light Years"" features an interesting voice cast, terrific visuals (if somewhat limited animation at times), and intelligent plotting, with one of the great punch lines of all time from Christopher Plummer's character -- I won't spoil it here!"
4,Lost Legend,"I saw ""Light Years"" several years ago when a co-worker left it lying around work. I watched it and was very impressed. I thought the animation was great, and found many of the character movements so fluid and realistc. I liked the story as well, and many of the concepts of the societies were very unique. A very well written story, and well made movie."
2,Its better then Odin... but...,"Well ok..I am sure the book was fascinating.I was not entertained by this movie at all.But it could have been alot worse.For the late 1980s the animation is bad.I'll be honest. What this movie needs is a remake.With up to date animation like Titan AE or somthing.That is all it really needs.The animation is quite boring,and well all around its boring.Its excitement failed to grab me."
2,Not what I expected,"We bought 2 crates that look like these several years ago. We hoped to get 2 moe so we would have a set for each car. We ordered 2 crates, 1 of the crates arrived broken. The quality was not as good as the ones we already owned. We returned the crates for a refund."
4,Folds flat and comes up big,We've had these things for years and just bought some new ones for my kids. Works great as a laundry basket and to/from college.
5,Very functional,This simple crate is great. I put it in the trunk of my car and it holds the shopping bags from rolling around.
5,The Perfect Puppy Book,"This delightful puppy book is a joy to read! The language dances on your tongue, just like the lively puppies who romp through the pages. A perfect gift for anyone, child or adult, who has or is getting a puppy of their own. The book tells what it's like to have a puppy around the house...yet its charm is in the enthusiastic and caring portrayal of the pleasures of being a puppy and having puppies in your life. This is a book to read again and again....it will end up dogeared and loved for sure."
5,Cute book,"Very cute book! The first time I read this book from the library, I knew I wanted it for my girls. They love it and so do I! Cute content and illustrations too!"
2,"Bah, humbug.","We're big fans of Ms. Meyers' earlier book, ""Everywhere Babies,"" but this one was a big disappointment. The writing is simplistic and vacuous, and the artwork lacks the level of detail that made ""Babies"" so fascinating to read over the years. Plus, this puppy book is nauseatingly cutesy-wootsy (and I *like* cute books!) I'm sure there are lots of folks who'll love this book and get all puppy-wuppy over it, but it met with a pretty blank response in our household. (Axton)"
4,pretty decent,I installed these on my motorcycle and they achieved what I wanted. Simple hook up and look nice for a good price. The module produces a cyclic sound while in operation. Good buy.
2,BORING,"This book is a little too squeaky clean for my taste. LL has been through a lot of tragedy and triumph in his life, so why does he have a difficult time writing out a cuss word? He does not really take you into his life or provide a gritty profile of abuse or the ghetto he grew up in. It's not worth the time."
3,UNCLE L IS WILD,"In reading I MAKE MY OWN RULES I found out that LL Cool J, one of the sexiest men ever, faced a lot of trials and tribulations in his life. LL shows true courage as he realizes his life wasn't how it should be and rectified the situations. I loved the honesty as well as the detailed time line and family portraits. LL is not just beautiful to look at he's the complete package!"
5,LL Cool J lovers,"LL Cool J.'s I make my own rules is a story about his life. James Todd Smith tells about how he is abused as a young child by his father. Later on in the auto biography, he starts to tell us about hpw he gets into the rap business. When he gets into the rap business, he shares with us some of the thigs that occuroff the stage, For example, in one chapter of the story, he says that he goes in the back to the bathroom and haves sex with this lady that he barely even knows in the bathroom sink.LL Cool J. shares a lot of personal experiences that he has in his life throughout this book.I Make My Own Rules is a book strictly for those who love that sexy man with that big dimple on his left cheek (LL Coll J.)!"
2,"He may be able to rap, but he sure can't write books!!","Now don't get me wrong, it took a lot of strength to be able to tell the world about your life. But this book shows that LL is an amateur at writing books. All those quotes in parentheses just got so annoying!!!! And plus he kept repeating some of the same stuff over and over. Next time LL, hire a better editor!!!!"
5,How time flys,"I bought this book to find out about a little girl that I used to know. That little girl grew up in St. Albans, Queens. When I moved away, I had heard that she was going out with some local rapper that was very good. I worried about her then, but I don't worry about her anymore. James married her and they have a beautiful family. I read the book for info, but was pleasantly surprised by Cool J's earned maturity. I like people who are truthful and there is no question as to that point with Mr. Smith. I am almost 50, but I believe that the Smith's are a good example for other rappers as how to live life to the fullest and what is most important. Listen to his words. A good lesson."
4,a good book,"i respect LL Cool J alot.i like his older music better than his newer stuff but i always keep an ear on this rap pioneer.so when i found out about this book i was excited and it was real good.the rise of his career&the inside of the business especially chapter 9.this is the first book that i've ever read that had a sticker on it.that alone peaked my interest.he has done alot with his career from rapping,to actor on tv&film.a good solid read."
5,It's one of the best books I have ever read.,"This book is a must read. I have been a fan of LL Cool J since his first song Radio. I read the book in one day (8 hrs to be exact) I just couldn't put it down. I felt his joy and pain. I just can't believe what his father but most his stepfather did to him. His ""Father"" song is the best. I love that song. It just makes you think that there are a lot of people out there, but he overcame it all. He wanted to be somebody and be the best that he could. I commend you for being a good great rap artist, a husband and a father. I love you LL Cool J and I hope to one day meet you. It has been one of my dreams and I hope that one day it comes true. Keep it real baby. Love ya Annette S."
5,I love L.L. and I LOVE this book!!!!!!!-Monique Hart,"I was truely impressed by this book. It was well written and very moving. I read this book in one day!!!! It was that good. I was already in love with the entertainer, but this book gave me a glimpse of the ""Real Person"" I probably would have never gotten to know. I commend the author and also Mr. Smith for his courage in writting the book and coming clean about his past and letting us know where he plans to go in the future. This book will make you laugh and cry and even at times despise L.L. but it's all worth it in the end because this book makes for excellent reading. Again, I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!"
5,VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!,This book is one of the most compassionate books I've ever read!! This is a great tool for those who have suffered many abuses in their lives!! I can truly relate!!! LL shows a side of his life that has been truly painful to him and his family and he's extremely truthful and honest throughout the entire book!! I admire a person that can open their soul to the whole world as he has in this Book!!
3,One of the greatest,"I been a fan of LL since ""Going back to Cali"". LL has been doing his thing for a long time. His book is a must read for any hip hop head. My only question is: LL, why sport a FUBU hat in a GAP commercial? And in your freestyle, you say For Us By Us, the FUBU slogan. Maybe GAP doesn't know it, but I feel you disrespected them. All aside, good book though."
4,Smooth and dreamy,"The tone Woody Shaw gets out of his trumpet is smooth, his style is unique, and his improvisational skills are impeccable. He has appeared on countless recordings, either as a leader or band member, and I have heard only a few of these releases so I'm no expert on his entire recorded catalogue. However, of those I have heard, this disc is my favorite. His tight and talented band on ""Lotus Flower"" is, Steve Turre (trombone), Mulgrew Miller (piano), Stafford James (bass), and Tony Reedus (drums). All songs are original upbeat jazz numbers (three composed by the band mates, two by Woody) that groove big time and the playing is superb."
5,This is good music,"With an All Star alt-country lineup featuring everybody from Los Lonely Boys, Lucinda Williams, Catlin Cary (Whiskeytown), the Jayhawks, and Calexico to Steve Earle, there is no way this CD could have been bad. Every song is great, but standout tracks are Los Lonely Boys on Castanets, Sheila E. and Pete Escovedo on The Ballad of the Sun and the Moon (changing the song up quite a bit from the excellent version that was on the By the Hand of the Father CD), and the always excellent Ruben Ramos on the beautiful Thirteen Years. But as good as these covers are, most of the songs were sung perfectly the first time around by Alejandro himself, and not everyone is capable of keeping up with the original. Still, it is great to hear different takes on these songs, and the last track shows Alejandro hasn't lost any of the magic."
5,Unbelievable Artist and Album,"I became aware of Alejandro Escovar just a month or two ago and just had the opportunity to see him live at Austin City Limits Music Festival in Sep 2008. This Austin songwriter/performer is the real thing. A critical bout with Hepatitis C created this gathering of artists to pay homage to his songwriting and fund his medical bills. Personally, I cannot find a song on this collection I do not like. What a thrill to first hear this compilation of his music and now be able to explore his other work. Get this album - you won't regret it."
2,13 years,"Alejandro has been writing darn good music for a long time now. Often overlooked in the mass market popularity contest of the music business, but respected by his peers. It's a great intro to some of his music, and I recommend it as such. It may be only me, but I'm a little tired of Los Lonely Boys, a better story than band, and Castenets is over played. And why did someone not cover 13 Years, one of Al's very best songs ever?"
4,"The movie's good, but will Anne shut her piehole?! Like NOW?","Okay, this 2 part feature film is good (artwork looks great, dub is pretty audible, unique plot line). However, despite the dub being audible, it is also supremely annoying, ESPECIALLY on Anne (no offense to the otherwise excellent voice actress Amanda Winn-Lee). She admits to playing lots of spastic girls and women, but this is overdoing it. The battles are well animated. There is a great deal of violence, but it is not in the unneeded range... Still, all the cons aside, this is pretty good, but why, oh WHY did I stick with that HIDEOUS dub?"
3,It's like an overnight fling...,"Hey, for $7 (at Fry's), I thought this was a bangin' deal. I'm not gonna repeat what the synopsis said but I think this is something cool enough for a teenager or an adult action buff to appreciate. Yeah, the story would toss out factoids left and right and if you're not into all that jumping around trying to puzzle pieces together then this movie would just turn you off near the end. BUT, for $7, ya can't beat it with my granny's whip."
2,Boring and Unamusing,"I'd Have to Agree with soldiersofoz. The movie never really developed. You sat there watching something you knew the ending to already. And soldiersofoz was right, the one chick seemed to scream ""Avatar"" every time she was in a scene. The Sob stories told in the movie made you wanna cry. Not over their sad lives but for them to shut up. It was a dissapointment and I feel sorry for my brother who bought the movie. Thats my opinion though, you could love it. Doubtful though."
1,SUPER ATRAGON = SILENT SERVICE,This anime is the same boring silent service anime.All they did was changing its name
2,False Ad???,"I called Oster (866-588-1141) on 5/4/2008. They have informed me that they do NOT sell any 1000 Watt Oster Fusion Blender. Not sure where this 1000 W is coming from, Oster declines that they have one!! All fusion blenders are 600 W, which is approximately 0.8 HP."
2,Short life span,"I needed to use my blender almost every day because I am a vegan and I like my food homemade. I didn't want to pony up 400+ for a blendtec or a vitamix so I researched and settled on the oster. I have had it a little over six months and the drive just came off. Before I had to replace the jar because that cracked and then I had to replace the metal agitator, while these parts weren't that expensive it turned out to be a waste because now I have to buy a whole new blender after such a short amount of time. I'm very disappointed and now I am trying to substitute my food processor and its not working out. After this experience I don't think I will buy another oster product."
3,Poor jar/base connection - good customer service,"The Good: Plenty of power, nice jar, excellent smoothie preset, solid customer service.The Bad: Poor connection between base and jar results in stripping of drive shaft, eventually rendering the blender useless.I don't see any other complaints about this on Amazon, so perhaps this started off with operator error, but my wife and I have found that it's easy to start the blender without realizing that the jar is not fully seated in the base, resulting in stripping the drive shaft. The more times this happens, the more likely it is to happen, until at this point, due to wear on the drive shaft, it's almost impossible to find the point at which the jar is properly seated and actually get traction between the drive shaft and the blades. To Oster's credit, they have sent me a new unit with very little hassle, hence the 3-star review."
2,Not a good food processor,"The first dish I attempted to make was a salsa, for which the recipe was provided in the Oster Manual. I was very disappointed at the consistency. Quartered, small tomatoes and small onions were left at practically the same size after much processing. The pieces that DID get processed were blended into a mushy, wet mess rather than chopped. For the second attempt my husband and I made smoothies. The machine was INCREDIBLY loud. It even shook in place on our counter top. The results of the smoothie were mediocre. The consistency was just fine, but the Oster did no better and no faster of a job than a $20 blender could have provided. The ""dual"" ability of this appliance is very poor. It's a blender - a very loud one, not a food processor. I'm returning it."
2,I wish I loved it.,"I've owned this contraption about a year now. It's been collecting dust mostly, but have recently gained interest in it again. So, the last few mornings have involved making basic smoothies, no ice involved, only frozen fruits. It would work for about a minute or two, then it just quits stirring. There are still chunks of stuff in there. I wouldn't recommend this considering the cost of it for a blender that doesn't live up to its expectations."
3,it does the job,"I wanted a blender to make protein smoothie shakes and it does the job. As a novice smoothie maker, I didn't realize how much trouble it is to blend frozen strawberries. I found defrosting the strawberries a little before putting into the blender helpful. Otherwise, my husband and I love it."
5,Great so far,"I purchased this blender over a year ago, and it has not disappointed me yet. I make smoothies with large ice cubes added, and it handles them very well. It's great for making fine crumbs, liquifying foods, mixing batters & chopping veggies for soups. I paid almost as much for a small, weak blender with all plastic parts. I especially like the large size glass jar.There has been some talk about it being marketed as a 1000 watts, when it is actually 600 watts. I don't know what's up with that, but I can tell you that whatever the true wattage, it has more than enough power for me. I don't usually need to run it on more than the low speed."
2,masterflop,"Buy the regular Mastermind instead of this ""special"" one for kidsThis is not easier to use and is poorly made."
2,Get the regular version,"The idea of a simpler version of Mastermind for younger players is sound. BUT... the execution here is extremely poor. The pieces don't fit in the slots so they constantly fall over. While it might be cute to make the pegs animal shapes, that just makes them harder to handle. A better version would have been slightly larger and easier to handle, with the pegs fitting into the slots more firmly. I'm an adult and I find the pieces frustrating, so you can imagine how my 6 yos feel about it. You can essentially turn regular Mastermind into a children's version by eliminating one or more of the color choices (just set them aside before play) and/or one of the slots (just stick a line of masking tape over it until your kid is ready for the more challenging version). Voila! Something that will last longer and that actually works."
2,buy the original!,"Great game, horrible design. Pieces are hard to handle and fall over at the slightest nudge of the game board. Almost impossible for a 6 year old to uncover the hidden side without knocking all of them over. I wish I had bought the original game edition!"
3,Too easy,"I bought this on Friday to play with my 5 and 4 year olds. It is too easy. It is now Sunday and it takes them 3 times or less to break the code. My boys do enjoy the game, but I'm purchasing the advanced version today to make it more challenging."
3,Frustrating for little hands,I'm wondering if the makers of this toy actually played it with a child. I played with my 7 year old daughter and neither of us could handle the little jungle animal pieces without dropping them and knocking all of the other ones off the game board. The play pieces in the Mastermind I remember as a kid had little pins so that they couldn't get knocked out of their spot. We've had a few games now that were thwarted b/c the info from previous guesses was lost. Come on guys! This is an easy fix!
1,GARBAGE!!!,"Original price: $101.00Price: $27.00You Save: $74.00 (73%)Trust me it could have been a dollar and it wouldn't have been worth it. The Neu Home 17745 Organize It All Concord 3-Tier storage cart is garbage, and they wanted originally $101.00 for it - that is laughable! One of the wood sides has a wood knot in it and at that knot it was cracked, the cuts to the wood aren't straight, so attempting to put the baskets into the pre-drilled holes was impossible, they won't line up properly. Yes, the product arrived quickly, but my guess is it arrived quickly because they wanted to get rid of the product from their inventory as quickly as possible. Save your time and money DON'T purchase this product no matter how cheap..I guess the old adage applies - you get what you pay for..but even at $27.00 and for the size it is it should have been decent.Neu Home 17745 Organize It All Concord 3-Tier Storage Cart"
1,Very abstract and not clear,"I had such a hard time following up with this book. There is no complete examples. The book explains the initial and final steps to problems skipping many important details in the middle. The example problem in chapter 8 about the bounded revised simplex method took me 5 days to understand. Also, the complametary slackness example in chapter 5 was confusing to understand.As a student, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone trying to learn linear programming for the first time."
1,garbage,"i don't understand why everyone is giving this book such great reviews. as a linear programming student, i find this book extremely difficult to understand, very poorly orgranized, extremely lacking in practical examples to demonstrate the concepts that the author is attempting to describe, and basically a piece of garbage. it was obviously written by a mathematician, not someone capable of teaching. i would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Rent before you buy! Don't fall for the famous names,"Yes, Spike Lee is a great director. Yes, Steve and Cedric are without question two of today's most gifted comedians -- witness the Steve Harvey Show on TV. This film however catches them spinning 2nd rate material, mixed with very VERY foul language. Second stringers Hughley and Mac are far less talented, but even more gross. Sure, the film has some inspired funny moments, but you have to be in the mood for a lot of profanity. Just make sure you rent before you buy."
1,Terrible,I love Steve harvery and was why I decided to watch this...It was horrible...the comedy would have been fine had they not chosen to use God;s name in vain every sentence...wish comics would realize cussing and vulgar language doesnt make one funny....
5,Funny Guys and Gals,"Recently Bernie Mac passed away and they had his memorial in Chicago, IL, where I live. I have always been a huge fan of his and was saddened to hear of his passing. I had seen this DVD sseveral times, but when I heard he had passed I just had to purchase it. I'm glad I did. The Kings and the Queens are hilarious! R.I.P. Mac man."
5,Funny as Hell,"Real funny, apart from the Steve Harvey dissing hip hop, but is real funny , My man Spike also did a good Job."
2,it was okay,"Not as funny as what I imagined it would be, it was just okay,. I wish I knew of a funnier one because I love these guys."
1,don't waste your money,This DVD was the worst edition I have ever seen. I was ready to laugh as I had seen a lot of kings of comedy on television but wanted to see it with out comericals. This edition only shows bits and pieces of each performer not the entire show. It has lots of behind the scenes shots that were just comments on how funny the show was. I wanted to see for myself how funny they were not someone telling me how funny they were. Highly dissapointed with this purchase!
5,A,"this movie is hilarious. you should buy it or even rent it. i cant garantee you'll like it. dont listen to them haters hatin on this dvd. yeah, i agree that maybe its none too smart to make fun of your own culture, but its still funny. it would still be funny if any body from another race made fun of thier own culture. well anywayz this is a good movie. but its not as funny as the latin kings of comedy."
4,great comedy fun,"i watched this with a friend of mines years ago. i watched it again and i enjoyed it then and enjoy it now. everybody does their best however cedric and bernie mac steal the show. bernie mac is especially good. be warned, he says what he wants with language that is hard to swallow. i loved his performance and realized what talent we lost a couple years ago. watch it and enjoy."
3,Always funny,"The Kings of Comedy is ALWAYS funny. Even knowing what jokes are coming next does not diminish the humor. Between Steve Harvey talking about the Building Fund and Sister Odell to Cedric parking the space shuttle. It brings back memories of being back in the day and back in the neighborhood.However, the quality of the video on this DVD was very disappointing. It had the quality of what may be a copy of a copy of a copy. If I had known this was not an original version, I may not have purchased this version of a GREAT and VERY FUNNY performance."
1,A negative 10 stars,"This is exactly what's wrong with black america today; the notion that we would support and go to these modern day minstrel shows where four house negroes would make fun of our culture(black culture) is very disturbing indeed. Is this what black comedy has come to? There was a time in our history that we would frown at such things, but there is no more pride left in our race, which this is the exact reason why we laugh. Comedians like Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx didn't make us look bad when they did comedy, and now their legacies have been decimated with this video and these men and others like them. If you are lack and have any pride in our culture, not only would you not buy this album, but drive them and others like them out of the buisness!!"
1,kings & queens of comedy my ASS,"How can they call themselves the ""kings"" of comedy? Not only that, but what ""comedy"" was there in this thing? It was them making complete fools of themselves. There's nothing really funny about that; unless you're an idiot who doesn't know what's funny. In short, the ""kings"" of comedy are nothing more than jesters that can be expended without much cost.As for the ""queens"" in this travesty, does anyone even know who the hell any of those ladies are? What more can be said? Their boring, overdone routine made me want to vomit. In short, they shouldn't be called the ""queens"" of anything; let alone comedy since there are other female comedians who are way funnier and have a thoudsand times better material than these blowhards.It's a real shame that the people in those DVDs wasted their time and money seeing something that wasn't funny in the first place. It would be an even bigger shame if someone actually wasted time and money to BUY these DVDs."
3,what a comedy,"i enjoyed the comedy, i laughed untill i started sheding tears, see for urself. oh my God, the queens were awesome."
4,A good chuckle,"This documentary was brilliant right from the start. The friendship and mutual respect between the guys is apparent. The filming was excellent making you feel apart of the crowd and atmosphere. What I liked about this was the regular use of music to add entertainment, you could really feel the warmth and reminiscing when Harvey played some old skool tracks. For me all except D.L were funny. I just don't find D.L. funny but I guess it's who you identify with you find funny. Ced was the best right from the get go. His entry music smashed it and jokes on blacks in hockey, run co-ordinator and breakdancing all made him the best on the night for me. For all round entertainment, jokes and music this DVD is a must have. It's a shame we don't get more of this stuff in the UK. Really cheers me up after a long day/ week."
5,:D,"I brought this for my mom for Mothers Day. She's been whinning and complaining that she wasn't able to find it in department stores. She's not 100% into buying things online so I took it upon myself to get her something that she's been asking for. It came just in time, she hasn't quit laughing since I gave it to her. So she's happy :)"
3,does not play in my dvd player,when i bought this movie i thought it would play in my dvd player and it did not luckily it only plays on my computer but would rather watch from the comfort of my couch.
4,Excellent contemporary commentary,"I recently completed a seminary course in Ephesians for which this commentary was not itself required, but each time I was in the library I found myself turning to it for broader insight on the cultural setting of the letters. If my first choice on Ephesians would have to remain Lincoln's exhaustive Word commentary, I would nonetheless suggest MacDonald's as a significant contribution from which to draw. Taken with either Schnackenburg or Yoder Neufeld on Ephesians, and Dunn or Lohse on Colossians, one would have as wide a view on these key NT letters as seems currently available."
5,The Best of Live Jazz,"I highly recommend Live at Montreux, a rocking passionate performance. The reeds, trombone, bass and drums serve to compliment one of jazz's most underrated pianists. This is a definite must for any fan of live jazz."
4,Stonkin!!!!!,"Dollar near his best, with a great band in Montreux. Totally swinging, and a great variety of his greatest styles, both modal and changes."
4,Metal Gods....Maybe!!,"For those who liked Helloween with Michael Kiske on lead vocals - this album is for you. You can also here a little Iron Maiden, lots of Hammerfall, and a little Rhapsody in their sound. Great cover and great metal album!!"
1,"its not my shop you send me "" future beats vol. 1 and the ilustration is of ""midnight sun""","i am angry .my shop must be ""midnight sun"" a heavy metal band not ""future beats vol.1 you dont send me for what i paid.honestly"
3,Kaizen Myth,"For 25 years I have been teaching high level engineers and directors at Honda, Mitsubishi Fuso, Mazda and a host of auto part manufacturers.Kaizen is a mythical term in modern day business practices. Japan's ability to produce high quality products across the board stems foremost from the from the cultural value of obedience to authority. From a young age people are taught to follow an authority figure. Combine this allegiance with a deftness to be meticulous - also instilled through the education system - and you have a workforce which can attain high product quality. Kaizen only works because of the docile obedience of the workforce, not because the theory is a magic bullet."
3,Not bad,Its not bad but it appears a little thicker in the image so i was a little surprised at its width/thickness. I haven't proposed yet though so lets see how it goes ;-)
4,Lovely little ring,This ring looks bigger in the picture than it really is. I bought it as an addition to my diamond ring. It is a lovely little ring that enhances my diamond.I would consider getting another too for the value. I say it was a bargain.
4,Loved it until the ending...,"As a native Cajun from Lafayette and Vermillion Parish now living in New York, reading this book (my first Burke novel) was in many ways like being home. Burke has the culture, the dialect and diction, everything about Acadiana down cold. Brilliant writing and I can't wait to start Elysian Fields. However, the ending of Jolie Blon's Bounce for me was anti-climactic. I was anxiously anticipating a showdown between Legion Guidry and Dave Robichaux and instead, Guidry is struck by lightning! I had to re-read this section of the book twice more to be sure I hadn't misinterpreted the outcome.I did find the character of Sal Angelo intriguing and I believe he is symbolically Dave's guardian angel against the embodiment of Lucifer, Legion Guidry. Still, I would have preferred to see Dave put a cap in 'ol Legion once and for all as I imagine Dave would have preferred as well."
4,Jolie Blon's Bounce,"EXCELLENT LOUISIANA MOOD.Overall I found this book to be a great description of Louisiana and its' tortured, mingled and maniac race relations. The description of Legion and his evil qualities turned out to be very believable. There are people and things that can't be explained in this world. My only fault with this book is there are no Black women who are decent working women. Is every Black woman a crack addict and prostitute (by choice, by accident, by birth in Louisiana) I do rank this book in the top five (5) of novels by James Lee Burke."
1,Jolie Blon's Bounce Flat,This is the only book by James Lee Burke that I did not enjoy and I have read them all. He seems to have lost all of his ability to hold a story together. Boring too!
1,Audible version bites,"I listened to the audio version of this book. I invested about 400 of 800 or so minutes and I had to quit. And I very rarely quit a book, audio or hard copy. It was disjointed, and worse, it was dull. I had to keep reminding myself of what mystery the hero was trying to solve. Perhaps it was the narrator who slurred his words and sounded drunk. I have to give this audio book a big thumbs down."
2,Good story -- horrible narration,"After reading PURPLE CANE ROAD, I decided to buy the AudioCD of JOLIE BLON'S BOUNCE for my iPod. What a mistake! I could barely comprehend what was going on in the plot. The reader, Mark Hammer, was truly awful. He spoke in a slow, mumbling, gravelly-voiced monotone that made it difficult to understand what he was saying most of the time. He had two voices -- one white and one black. It was impossible to discern which character was speaking at any given time. Also, the character of Dave Robichaux on page seems to be in his mid- to late-50s. The narrator sounds older than my 87-year old grandfather. I stopped listening after about 3 hours. The next day, I went my local library and borrowed the print edition."
5,James Lee Burke Fan,"In trying to read EVERY possible novel by my newest, most fav author, Amazon has been a treasure chest!!! I have found books on cd through Amazon(PLUS a couple of movies made from a few of the books) that even our libraries don't have!!! Thank you!!!!"
1,Garbage,What a piece of garbage. If this is one of Burke's better works I surely don't want to see any of his bad ones.
4,Worthwhile reading..,"if you are a JLB reader, this continues in the same tradition. These kinds of serial books are becoming a little formulaic, and I wish the characters would maybe take a trip, get out of their element. Just for a change."
2,I don't believe the praise,"I don't believe the praise and admiration for this book. It is, in my very humble opinion, the worst murder/mystery/thriller I have tried to read in years. It is a slow plodding attempt at suspense with a confusing cast of characters who are neither likable or interesting. This is my first attempt at reading one of Mr. Burkes books and certainly my last. I cannot believe this is one of the best of a series."
4,"Looking forward to a long, beautiful relationship!","This was my first brush with the Dave Robicheaux series, but it certainly won't be the last!After a slow start, I was awestruck by Burke's poetic/hypnotic prose and the originality of Robicheaux in a literary world filled with hard-boiled, moralistic detectives/P.I.s. Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series has been my long-time favorite, but I think I've found a new standard bearer for the genre.I'm used to protagonists with a ""history"" but the fact that Robicheaux's demons are always so close to the surface (and sometimes break through) was highly entertaining. Sidekick Clete Purcel was also a revelation (and a real scene stealer whose periodic female dilemmas had me laughing out loud).I look forward to starting book one in the series and getting to know Dave Robicheaux / James Lee Burke much better in the months ahead."
3,Born on the Bayou,"I would probably read anything written by James Lee Burke simply because I enjoy his style. The vivid details in his descriptions of the deep South, as well as his ability to capture the kind of racial dynamics that have somehow managed to make it into the 21st Century, are remarkable. The writing is often poetic and insightful, and Burke seems to recognize just what it is that separates the truly bad characters from the rest of us. That said, at some point the reader is forced to suspend reality within the pages of Jolie Blon's Bounce, which in my opinion, ultimately becomes more of an allegory about good versus evil than a murder mystery."
4,Neat gadget for the price,We ordered the Spy Tek Spy Ear for my son's spy-themed birthday party. He played with one to try it out before we gave it to the kids. He liked it and it works as advertised. Overall it's a pretty neat gadget for such a low price.
4,Great workout,This is a great workout for beginners and intermediates.One word of caution - it requires multiple levels of weights and a step box (an insert offers them for sale). END
2,Below standard compared to other Firm Tapes,"I own all the Firm tapes except the Basics Series. Firm tapes are usually great. But this is one of the worst ones. There is too much triceps work and an over emphasis on squats and high bench step ups. This is a pleasant tape as are all Firm tapes but the workout is disjointed. This is one of the three worst Firm tapes. The others I dislike have a boring ballroom ""aerobics"" section. ( and I like to dance )"
1,Not for me,"This is more of a glamour routing than anything else. Too busy -Greek/Roman statuettes in the background various sizes, huge fireplace, boring routine, and the participants' are so phoney. The instructor and the participants routine are more erotic than anything else. I couldn't bare doing the entire video. Oh and the music, too loud and didn't sync with the moves. This video had potential, if it wasn't for all that.Now I know why I had it hidden for so many years behind my other exercise videos."
5,What a Workout!,"If you want/need a great tricept workout, this is the video for You! I still feel the burn! As with all ""Firm"" Workouts this one is just as classy as the others. Pam Cauthen is the instructor and she is one of the best. If you want a great all around workout get this video along with its partner ""Firm Cardio."" You won't be sorry!"
5,Best of all exercise tapes.,"I own 4 of the firm tapes and this is the best. I also own several other exercise tape with big names and again, this tapes beats them all hands down."
5,This is a great workout,This workout presents a challenge to the novice as well as the intermediate exerciser. It is great for muscle development as well as cadio-vascular development. And you really do see visible results within 10 workouts! END
2,This is NOT a great workout.,"This workout does make you sweat, but so does cross-examination by the police. It's poorly structured and erratic, working some muscle groups far more than others and a few not at all. For example, most of the upper-body work is triceps and the lower-body section works one leg, shifts to a section of ab work, and then works the second leg much later and with fewer reps. The workout is interrupted with two too-short ""aerobic"" intervals that are just plain confusing. Also, while it's billed as ""low-impact"" there's a section of jumping -- by definition a high-impact activity.Like most FIRM tapes, this workout requires a ridiculous amount of equipment, including several sets of hand weights, leg weights, a FIRM ""tall box,"" and for complete overload a specially weighted barbell and a towel. The FIRM is willing to sell you a high-priced version of all those items, of course, except possibly the towel."
5,Amazing results!,"It doesn't matter ff you're a FIRM fan, a video workout fan, or just want to get in shape, this tape is for you! The instruction is fantastic and after doing the tape a few times, you'll look and feel better then ever! It's intense, but exciting. Definitly not of of thsoe workouts you can't wait till the end of. Make sure you get the compliment video, FIRM Cardio!"
4,A Pretty Darned Good Tape...,...for an exercise video! Even a beginner could do this tape - although it's a little too long to finish the first few times. All of the exercises are easy to do and they seem to work. You do need a bit of equipment to do the video - but I found it was easy to substitute stuff like a chair or step-stool rather than go out and but the equipment.
5,Totally entertaining - a delightful read!,"This is the most entertaining book I've read in some time! It's a story to get lost in. Enough tears and sadness to involve the emotions, and enough romance to involve them even more! Morgan Farrell is a wonderful hero and Kate Cameron the kind of heroine you really want to have a happy ending."
4,Aye . . . Patti is a damn fine storyteller,"Looking for a hero made me want to go to St. Augustine, spyglass in hand, wandering the shoreline for my very own pirate. Neither Wife for a Day nor Born to be Wild can hold a candle to this feel-good tale. Our hero was scarred inside and out, but still clung to his humanity. Kate had a lovely child and thought of her dead husband with affection. How refreshing! The epilogue was one of the sweetest I've read in a long, long time. Thank you Ms. Berg for this charming story."
5,I want my OWN Pirate to play with!,"Patti Berg is becoming one of my favorite authors after only reading two of her books; ""Wife For A Night"" and now ""Looking For a Hero"". Couldn't put it down until I had finished it even though I had laundry screaming to be done!""Looking For A Hero"" is one of the few books I would read more then once. Morgan Farrel, aka Blackheart, is one of the sexiest hero's to hit the pages of any romance book! I would love to see this wonderful author bring Morgan and Kate back in another novel....it would be a surefire best seller before it was even on the store shelves!"
2,Religious undertones turned me off.,"The plot and the charcters were wonderful, but the religous undertones have turned me off Patti Berg books."
5,The Horse,"St. Mawr is one of the wisest books I've ever read. In it you can find insight and answers to some of the toughest questions you may ever encounter. What is it that brings men and women together? What is it that drives them apart? What exactly is it that we are doing to each other? What does it mean to be civilized? To be savage? What does it actually mean to be human?D.H. Lawrence creates a world with very few words. These characters, though at times stereotypes or archetypes, are extremely real.This book changed the way I look at the world, deepened my understanding of myself and of those around me."
4,The Man Who Died,"St. Mawr & The Man Who DiedI bought this book in order to share Lawrence's vision of the Christian tale with a friend. It brings together universal resurrection imagery from diverse traditions in the moving, incendiary provocative intensity Lawrence is noted for."
5,Every Hymn Has a Spiritual Story,"This is a wonderful compilation of well-loved hymns and stories and devotional messages regarding them. The messages are uplifting and well-written. They are lovely little sermons. This book could be used before church choir practice to put the members in the right frame of mind regarding the music being worked on, and also inspires deep devotional thought for daily readings. It receives my strong endorsement."
1,never got uni\t,ordered unit on dec 7 with a proposed delivery of dec12-dec30{what's that???????} emailed the supplier twice with no reply. Filled a complaint with amazon and waiting for the outcome. Was supposed to be a chritmas present
5,Victorian discipline,"The best one of the genre since Sadopaideia and The Pearl, which I got in ... 1967 !Ideal support for erotic games online like Fond of Writing."
3,Good Book!,This was an okay romance story with likable characters. Easy light reading. Great for taking it easy and relaxing anytime.
3,Good Spanking story,"The story was good enough, kept me reading through the book. There is a certain amount of g/g to the story and it's a bit far fetched, but then, isn't most of it. There are parts of the story that redeem it and all in all i enjoyed it."
5,Should have been just as big or bigger than the deftones,"This is undenialably one of the greatest bands I have ever heard.Really.Ever since I bought this cd,I can't put it down.Every song is different,and perfect.This band had 3 albums.This one,and 2 before it(Tin cans with strings to you,which I also have,and Quick,which I don't have because it went out of print).Unfortunately,they broke up.They were around the same time as the deftones,and were friends with them as well.It's a shame they never got the same sucess though.Far doesn't sound like deftones though.They do have some simularities,but Far(to me anyway)sounds like a cross between deftones and our lady peace.I know,it's diffucult to think of a combination like that,but that's what it sounds like to me.Bottom line:If u are a fan of MUSIC in general,and don't have this cd,u are definitely missing out."
3,"Good lyrics, good music, but not good songs","This guy writes really good and emotional lyrics, but they just don't make it into a good song, WHY!?. The music is too fancy, and they put in too much music between the lyrics and that ruins the nice lyrics. Now I know why these guys aren't so famous. I think the band needs more experience, and need to know what making a song is all about. The well made songs are ""Really Here"", ""Mother Mary"", and ""Nestle"", and these are the only songs I like too."
2,Not as stunned as y'all,"Okay, the emotion is here, and they're certainly trying hard... But being aware of Jonah's devotion to SenseField, I can't help but call this recording largely derivative of that band AND others. The formulaic song structures (especially in the first several tracks) just scream out heavy influence from many other ""power-emo"" type bands who did it before and in most cases, better. The overblown production and at times painfully off-key vocals don't help matters here, either. And the SenseField worship becomes quite obvious in lyrics like ""...I was thinking of my faaather"". This is just one of those albums that might impress upon the very first listen, but subsequent spins reveal not much else behind the ""heartfelt"" thrust/tender whisper routine. Instead of this CD, pick up FAILURE's ""Fantastic Planet"" or way better yet, the self-titled HANDSOME disc."
5,A landmark record,Water & Solutions is an album so far ahead of it's time it's untrue. These guys set the foundation for a generation of emo bands. Coming across like a mixture of Helmet and Quicksand these guys mixed muscular metal with indie-rock. I would highly recommend this album along with Their first album Tin cans with strings to you.
5,Far is unlike other bands,"""Water and Solutions"" has got to be one of the most melloically intense and emotionally driven records I've listen to in a long time. Every song seems to grow on you. Listening to the cd once won't do it, but listening to the cd maybe 2-3 more times and you'll be hooked. This band is in the business to make an honest buck doing what they love without much media support whatsoever. If you like what Weezer does or enjoy Thom Yorke's voice or even dig the Deftones or Sunny Day Real Estate, this record will deliver for you. An absolutely rare and overlooked record that deserves the attention it's not getting."
5,"Far, finally getting some respect","I've been a follower of Far since their early indie label days. It's great to see them getting this level of exposure finally.Basically, if you buy this album and you like it, you will like the other 2 albums as well."
5,"Meditations, visualizations and other techniques","Jeffrey Hopkins' Cultivating Compassion, provides a Buddhist perspective on compassion and presents meditations, visualizations and other techniques and insights designed to increase a capacity for love and understanding. The goal is to banish selfishness: chapters use Buddhist principles to tell how."
4,Do not believe what Mr Pearson-Wright wrote...,"This album does NOT butcher Abbey Road. In fact, it's quite the opposite! Imagine what a bunch of zappaian jazzmen can do to such a masterpiece... It certainly sometimes differs quite a lot from the original album but who would want to hear an exact replica of Abbey Road and what would be the interest to listen to such a thing? None! So, what were having here is a jazzified live version of The Beatles' most accomplished oeuvre and a good one that is!Maybe Mr Pearson-Wright reveres The Beatles so much that it has to be treated with respect and thus duplicate every note at the identical. Mike Westbrook does not share that idea and proves that Abbey Road is still a very much alive piece of music, one that can be played with without damaging the original tour de force of Lennon, McCartney & co...Do try it (with an open mind) if you have the occasion, you won't regret the journey!"
3,Incorrect Item Description,"The Item listed on Amazon is not the item for sale. The item for sale is a 750W Power supply, not the chassis."
2,ahhhh,"whats with everybody sayin this is the greatist album ever... its not that great. the drumming is kick ass but... not much better than other lag albums.. i think trashed is the best so far... (well thats the only other one i have and im in love with it.) this cd is too happy... over use of melodys and crap. i mean.. sure it works a lot of the time but this cd isnt really that punk apart from the drum beats. trashed is punk. oh and you guy that said you listen to offspring and greenday and you say ur punk... man... get out more. listen to nofx, bad religion, casualties, OLD afi, circle jerks, OLD nufan, and then figure out which is more punk."
2,"Okay but just not ""Punk"" more like Polka","Well everyone gave this great reviews honestly I don't see whats so special about it. No punk, this is not punk at all. I like the beats, but the songs don't have that certain punkishness to them.Maybe it's just cuz I've been spoiled by Greenday, and Offspring, stuff like that, which is true punk. Man, I could of sworn I heard this on the easy listening station, haha."
5,In my opinion best lagwagon record,"I own all of the lagwagon CD's. This is the best. This is the point Joey's lyrics started improving and getting more meaning full. I love the older albums, but how many songs can you listen to about drinking beer? Everyone needs to check out Joey's other band Bad Astronaunt."
5,This is a great punk album!,"I first heard this album when i borrowed it from a friend, and ever since then i've been hooked on lagwagon. i love joey's voice. the guitars are awesome. the bass and drums just kick. this is just a great album! I love all the songs from the skate-rock of ""violins"" to the metal-esque ""ride the snake"" all in all this is one of my favorite punk albums, and you should buy it if you don't already have it."
5,LAGWAGON'S BEST ALBUM!!!,"ALL LAGWAGON ALBUMS ARE GOOD, DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT THIS IS FAR AND AWAY THEIR BEST...YOU MUST BUY THIS ONE."
3,pretty good,"don't get me wrong, this is a great punk album. I just like the newer cds much better. The production of this one isn't quite as good as let's talk about feelings or Double Plaidinum. Still, the songs are really great.Check out the tracks ""Bomb's Away"" and ""Sick"". Two Lagwagon Classics!!!!"
3,Pretty Good..................At First,"This was my second lagwagon album after Trashed. (which I thought was excellent)At first I thought this cd was good, but not great and way different than Trashed and Duh. (I had downloaded a few songs off Duh before)After months of listening to Hoss every now and then, it really did get boring. I really always listened to the same songs every time. (Name Dropping,Razor Burn,Black eyes, the ending of violins and sleep.)It really is more melodic/poppier than lagwagons first two releases. I still like melodic punk but the melodic punk on this wasn't even that great. The music on DP,Feelings and leftovers that i had heard before, were more impresive than the majority of songs on Hoss. In my opinion the stuff on Trashed, Duh and DP is the best."
3,Hmm...,"I loved this CD back when I could stand punk. If you're into that stuff, it's fairly good -- no stupid lyrics and a few interesting melodies. Not my thing now, but decent."
4,Very hard NOT to like,"Even if you are a crotchety old punk rock curmudgeon, you still hafta like this album. Lagwagon had been around awhile prior to this one and had some good releases, but this was when that ""Epi-Fat"" sound was really breaking out and thus all the more compelling. Very catchy tunes with surprisingly witty, insightful lyrics in a power-pop-punk package make it an irresistable recording. It's a shame that they would go on to change their sound and head toward a slicker, dumber Blink182 type sound. Get this one and remember pop-punk before the avalanche."
1,Trash,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is not worth the tape it is made of. What is so SICK about this movie is that it is package in a cool and scary cover but the movie and I use the term loosely, is nothing but homemade porn. I can't believe anyone ever thought that bad acting by trashy fools, ignorant plot, and shooting a movie with your mom's camera was ever a good idea. This piece junk was as bad as the movie The Item. Don't waste your time, money, or brain cells on these idiots that released this toilet water on anyone. Could be decribed as cruel and unusal punishment."
4,Great watch!,"This is a great watch. It has a unique kind of display, which takes a little getting used to (it's a bit hard to see at first). But, I would recommend this product. It is cool and super-functional."
2,"Nice watch, but...","This is a very nice looking watch. My husband bought it for me for Christmas, and I like it, but the time is VERY hard to read. The background is pink and the time is silver, which doesn't make for much contrast. I don't know how they got the time to show up in the pictures, it is not dark enough. I am debating on whether or not to return it due to the difficulty in making out the time and date."
2,Streamliners,"This installment reveals how transportation devices, not just wars and elections shape American history. Opponents of ""big government"" may hate it because the work implies that federal regulation is what hampered the railroad industry. It may be hard for younger people to relate to this, as we use the railroad's competition: cars and airplanes. However, this is about the rise and fall of a product. In the same way that cassette tapes, snail mail, BETA, etc. have risen and fallen, this transportation did the same. This documentary has diverse interviewees, including women and African Americans."
5,A masterpiece umong childrens literary works.,"Growing up in Canada and in this area where these pictures in the book were painted bring back fond memories of my childhood and reading and discussing this book with my kids gave them a better understanding of how the alphabet can be understood, and that there is alot more to our alphabet than we think. This is a great way to extend their knowledge to be more aware of various types of trees, wildlife, flowers, etc... This book is a masterpiece and should be added to everyone's book collection."
4,quality+value,The Nordic Merv 12 A/C Air Filters are a great value and are of a higher quality than those costing more than 2x at retail. I could do these over and over......
4,"goog product, sloooow shipping","After almost 3 weeks, I finally received the filters. They are well made and seem to do the job just fine. Just don't order if you are in a hurry. I give the product 5 stars but the company 3 for such slow shipping."
5,I love this BOOK!!,"This book is great, for both the movie lovers and the actually veterans of the war. This book tells alot of interesting facts! It is a very good book."
3,NOT BAD,If you enjoyed the movie you should enjoy this book. This is a great go-along-item to the film. There is plenty of information and a lot of photographs. Get a chance to reflect on the times.
2,Hardly Worth the Paper It Is Printed On,"This book is nothing more than glossy marketing propaganda for this cinematic perversion of historical events. There is a certain amount of reverence when handling the subject matter of War. No matter how much action they contain, most Hollywood War films usually have a base of genuine patriotism at their core. Even an anti-war film stays true to its course. PEARL HARBOR is not about patriotism or any higher aspirations. It's really all about CG effects and the almighty dollar at the expense of real lives. What is the value of this chameleon-like book spreading the pseudo- patriotic message of the film?"
1,Distortion of history,"A book about Pearl Harbor, the Movie should be a book *about* Pearl Harbor, the Movie! Here, there are a few pages of cast bio in the front, and about 20 pages of information of how the movie was made at the back (well, a paragraph or two of information per page, and lots of photos). In between is the 'real' history of the attack on Pearl Harbor...but it is illustrated by scenes from the movie - which really bore little relationship to the actual events and to use them to illustrate those events is horrible! At the very least, a photo of the real General Doolittle should have been put beside that of Alec Baldwin (who portrayed him) a photo of the real Genda beside that of Tagawa, who portrayed him), etc. This book succeeds neither as a history of Pearl Harbor, nor as a Making of the Movie."
3,TioOminos For Kids,"I am sorry that I purchased this game. I thought that the 'dominoes' would be plastic but are flat cut-out cardboard pieces. These domino pieces will not last. One spilled drink will be the end of them. I did not return the game for the shipping charges were almost as much as the game itself. Very disappointed. The children I have shown the game to are not even interested in playing because they have seem 'real' dominoes and do not wish to play with 'paper' stuff. So, so far this game has not even been taken out of the box and probably will not be, maybe I can give it as a gift to a very young child but then you cannot give it or play with too young a child or the domino pieces will all go to their month first. I should have read the product description much closer and more carefully. So really I am disappointed in the game and myself. One lesson learned."
4,On the money,"This book is very good for it's price. Some of the photos are a little close, so it's hard to picture how the plant will look mixed into your garden. There are also some plants that I've looked up and this book doesn't cover. Also, there aren't a lot of ideas for shadey areas. However, I would honestly recommend this book. There are hundreds (400 to be exact) great plants in it. It also gives detailed information on how to care for the plants both before and after planting. This book is great for beginning and seasoned gardners alike!"
3,needs better QA for Kindle version,"The book is a typical thriller, with a rather over the top storyline, but an enjoyable read for most anyone that likes fantasy thrillers. In that regard, I'd give the book 4 stars.The Kindle edition has very poor quality control, quite inexcusable. The typeface constantly changes from normal to bold, throughout the book. That is very distracting and annoying, because it's much more difficult to read with the constantly changing text. That's the reason for the 3 star rating."
1,Waste of time,"I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more."
3,SLow and Steady loses the race,"Same here, So far I am 1/2 way through and it is very slow reading, or listening since I do the unabridged audio scene.First off, I had read that the whole team was back together, and so far only one tea and biscuits cracker has arrived.So my vote is to go rejoin up with Kurt Austin and NUMA and put this one on the shelf.RF"
1,Unreal!,"A make-believe story! My 9 year old grandson would love it! I had to skip through mostly unbelievable nonsense - horror, etc. I like mystery, but it has to be within the realm of reality. There was nothing possibly real in this crazy ""make-believe"" story. In fact it was boring!"
4,"Book OK, Binding is BAD!","The novel is good. Several pages were loose in this paperback edition, however. A complaint to Amazon was not answered."
5,great glasses for price!,"These glasses are great. very nice size - plenty of room for swirling. Oblong shape is great, height of glass is very nice. though they don't fit in the dishwasher top rack. Afraid to put on the bottom, so wash by hand. these glasses made an amazing difference drinking my cabernet instead of out of a rounder generic red wine glass. Great deal for the price, they have good ""Thickness"" to them, meaning they feel sturdy and fit in the hand nicely. they look nice -- not fancy crystal but at this price very nice quality. Highly recommend."
5,You HAVE to have Riedel wine glasses...,"Trust me, if you don't own nice wine glasses, and you have a nice bottle of wine, the experience is NOT the same. Invest in a good set of Riedel and you can't go wrong.It irks me when you pay big $$ at finer restaurants and the Sommelier come's to the table with cheap glasses..."
1,Riedel may make uglier glasses,"But you'll have to search hard to find them. They should simply cut the stems off and make them into ""0"" glasses. Whatever the virtues of the 'light-catching' stems, they're lost on me! Try the Ouverture series."
2,Very breakable,"They are beautiful glasses and we have owned a lot of wine glasses. But ordered 2 chardonney and 2 merlot and within 3 months all were broken. We hand washed and that itself broke one, moved one over on a table and it tipped over and broke , they will not hold up to everyday use so reserve for only very special sips!"
3,Good glasses when they survive shipping.,"I have used these glasses at friends house on the occasion, I like them very much, they add a lot to the wine drinking experience, enough so that I wanted some for myself. They are delicate, unfortunately they did not survive the shipping experience, I returned for refund with no issue. I will try again at another time."
3,What's all the fuss?,"I'm not sure that these wine glasses actually improve the wine, as some claim, but I like them enough. Maybe I don't have a discerning palette. Truly I can't tell any difference in the wine whether drinking from these crystal glasses or my everyday glass stemware from World Market. Seriously would not recommend to my friends at this price. But then maybe it's me..."
3,wine glasses,"They were fine. But maybe not worth the cost. Just average wine glasses...not anything to write home about. So, for the price I suggest purchasing something cheaper."
2,thin yoga strap,This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes. It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses. I would not purchase another one.
2,Broken,"This product appears to be nicely packaged, received on a timely bases, but was defective when we received it. It would not play at all even though it was new."
5,Pleased with product and service,This product was given as a gift. Recipient pleased with the product. Prompt shipping was an added plus.
2,Already broke.,"Very cheaply made. I have had it a month and it is already broken. Needle skips from first song to almost end of album. Will try a new needle but gee whiz, this one is only one month old."
1,"Retro looks, terrible sound.","This turntable is certainly one that looks good if you're going for that retro look, but it's sound quality is almost unacceptable. It's nice that it can play 78's, as I've inherited some of my grandmothers old 78's, but for anything else, it's not worth it. The overall sound is tinny and a poor representation of vinyl's potential. I had motor problems not long after I received it; it kept stopping in the middle of a song, sometimes with enough force to send the stylus scratching across the record surface. I don't know if the motor was overheating or what, but it was unacceptable, and it certainly is not good for the records. I would recommend spending a few more bucks and going with a lower-end Technics or Rega instead of this, if you're looking for good quality sound. If not, and retro looks are all you really want out of this turntable, this is the turntable for you."
1,Terrible sound,"I was excited to play some old records I hadn't heard in years. The unit looked nice and the price was right but The sound was so terrible... its unusable. It must be broken. I'll tear it apart and see if I can at least make it usable. I'm assuming it must be a bad solder somewhere.A friend saw mine sitting in my garage and said the same thing. Oh you got one of those too? I said ""Yeah, but its no good."" They sighed and said ""Yeah I got one as a present and its unusable junk. Too bad cause it looks neat and is a good idea, just sounds horrible.""So some of them must work ok - I can't imagine anyone would give it a decent review sounding like the one I got. So its probably a gamble on whether you get a working model because they are manufactured so cheaply. I'll probably buy something else that maybe won't look as cool but will hopefully work."
1,Record let down,"Very attractive case for the price but this is an embarrassing piece of junk. It was inoperable upon delivery. The drive belt turned out to be a plain old rubber band that could have been holding asparagus together in a previous life.Can't comment on the sound quality as the ""unit"" was immediately returned never to be heard from but if the sleek plastic composition of the tone arm is an indicator then Edison's gramophone probably was better in that department.If you want to be very disappointed and aggrevated I highly recommend this purchase."
1,Poorly built.,"Purchased one of these units in 2011. Never worked correctly, tone arm not adjustable, tears up records. Doesn't track correctly. Sound quality terrible and tinny. Avoid this player spend a few dollars and get a better quality unit. Finally threw mine out."
1,thanks for ruining christmas,"this is terrible, the turntable doesnt turn, there is loose stuff shaking inside the record player, the arm does not trigger the turntable. I had bought a bunch of used records to open on christmas morning and play on the new record player, nothing worked. It is garbage. Cheaply built."
4,Record Player Review,"This product is a basic record player and simple to operate. It isn't for extremely picky music lovers, just for people who want to hear their old record albums again or listen to their yard-sale finds. The volume doesn't go EXTREMELY high but is plenty loud enough and the sound can be adjusted somewhat using the tone dial. The case is thick and sturdy, but the actual turntable seems a little wobbly (thus the 4 star review, instead of 5). I've had no trouble with it and my family and I are enjoying it very much. I'm happy that I bought it and would do so again."
1,"Great looks, cheap design","I bought this turntable specifically to play old 78's, but at that high speed, the turntable seemed to shake. Plus, the tonearm is cheap plastic. After just two weeks of light use, it completely stopped working and I returned it to amazon. I picked up the Numark PT-01 Portable Turntable instead and it works great. It doesn't look retro, but it plays records great, which is the most important thing anyway."
3,okay for small room,"If you just want to listen to records, this is okay. But there is no output to other speakers, and the internal speakers are not adequate for even a small party with people talking. It's an okay piece of equipment to have if you just want to hear your tunes, but if you're looking for clarity, volume, or durability, this is not your record player. I returned mine and opted for one with an external jack."
4,very nice for the money,"actually much nicer than i expected after reading the negative reviews....plays at correct speed.....doesn't ""eat"" records. sound could be a little better, but for the price adequate. cabinet sturdy."
4,A very good sound to this little stereo.,Easy little stereo to take with you wherever you go. My husband loved that we now can play all of our old records. Its great for adults and older children to use.
1,Don't bother,"I thought this would be a fine player for my daughter's 8th birthday. I should have tried it out before letting her open it. Right out of the box, the tone arm assembly had been dislodged causing records to rub against the support. The quality of the whole package was what you'd expect for something more in the toy $15 price range. Thank goodness for Amazon's amazingly easy return policy including shipping. I wish I'd gone that route instead of trying to take it back to Target, who fulfilled the original order. After an hour there I ended up walking out of the store with no resolution."
1,Not worth the price.,"The item I received was defective. When I moved the tonearm to the record, the turntable clicked off. I am not happy with the quality and feel this item is not worth the price. I would like to return it for a refund. VL"
