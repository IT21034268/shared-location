3,Think about it,"This bracelet looks super. Also a bit different than your typical rope or link chain. Fun. I did not keep it because it runs small. It is not a true 8"" bracelet for two reasons: first, it only measures about 7.5 inches and second the lovely mesh is thick so it takes-up some length just because of the style. So, if you like a 7.0 or 7.5"" bracelet then this may well work for you. Enjoy!"
5,Great Cable,"I have always trusted Belkin products and one more time they haven't disappointed me. I purchased the cable to separate my wireless router from my 2 cordless phones. I was having a lot of interference, which resulted in slower internet speed. Since I started using the cable my internet speed and cordless phones have been working great."
5,Absolutely Vital,"Brewer & Shipley are unquestionably the most sadly overlooked artists to come out of the 1960s, and Tarko Road is the most-overlooked Great album of the period. ""One Toke Over the Line"" is often singled out owing to the controversy over its glancing drug reference, but it's not really a drug song, more a sort of generic lament. Nor is it the only great, great song on the album. ""Song from Platte River"" is haunting, ""Oh Mommy"" is political commentary presented with characteristically gentle humor. The bouncing ""Tarkio"" itself and the rockin' closer (barring bonus tracks) ""Fifty States of Freedom"" are worthy of any of the better-remembered groups of the time. (CSNY comes to mind, as do the Grateful Dead around their acoustic ""Working Man's Dead"" period, but such comparisons don't do justice to the vast talents of B&S.) The continuing lack of proper CD reissues of the B&S catalog is a shame and a scandal on the recording industry."
1,Unwatchable.,"I knew people would give this five stars simply because it's Bergman and Bergman can do no wrong. I too love Bergman but this one goes beyond the pale and is sick, not to mention boring. There are no redeeming qualities about this film and the characters are simply the most unappetizing characters I can remember seeing on film. The only ""good"" person in the film was the poor child, Isabelle. The acting was great; that's about it.It's a case of where the emperor has no clothes. Bergman lovers refuse to recognize this where Bergman is concerned. If this were his first film, I would never have seen another Bergman film."
2,"Sleep Pill, different name","The movie is well produced (Despite most of the movie takes place in one location). I loved Lena Endre (Marianne) acting. But this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. There is not a strong infidelity issue, it is taken as a game. The husband kills himself but he also had a lover for years, and I don't see why could he do that, if it was clear he was not happy with his wife, all was a masquerade.I love foreign movies, but even though this was written by Bergman and directed by his ex-wife, Liv Ullman, it is not what I expected. I could see it again just to see Lena Endre acting, but still I would need a jar of coffee."
3,"Pretty Jar, Hard to Get a Seal","I confess that when I read other reviews talking about these jars being difficult to get a seal, I assumed they were not written by experienced canners.Not so. I had to process these jars twice, and still did not get a good seal on all of them. I will be going back to good old mason jars with rings and lids!"
5,very pretty.,"used these to put jam and some other things in for a gift. Very pretty.I wanted 6 oz jars, but could only find 4 or 8. So these 5 oz were what i settled with. Just about right for the small jam gifts I was giving."
5,Beautiful jars,I use these jars for candles and herb work. They are gorgeous! I even have some just stuffed with pretty things to display. Would def purchase again!
5,Surprising durability,"These are beautiful little jars. I can't address their suitability for canning - I bough them to hold spices.I just dropped one of them from a cabinet onto a concrete floor. It fell about six feet, then bounced three times without suffering any damage. Evidently they are very solid."
5,decorative canning jars,Great Jars! They look GREAT! Easy to use and hold just the right amount for small batches of Home Made Hot Suaces and Peppers.
3,look nice,"These jars are functional and look nice. Having the jar top and rubber seal connected to the jar is a good way to ensure they don't get lost. However, it is sometimes awkward to have these parts attached, compared to using Mason-style jars. It's only an issue when pouring things out of the jar or washing the jar."
3,cute but not practical,"Several things I don't like aboput the product:a) the lids are one piece and not reusable and the size isn't available in stores here.b) the canning instructions that came with it say that you shouldn't fill hot liquids into jars, but instead add the product at room temperature to the jar: this is not how I can most things, especially jams!c) The jar only holds 5 ounces if you fill it to the top.They are super cute, though, so I will most likely be giving them away as gifts and won't worry about re-using it."
2,"Nasty, if you live in a country ruled over by Disney.","Frankly because of the other reviews of this DVD I'm struggling to not use sarcasm. But this is the best i can give it to ou straight. Dull. I know this wasnt ever going to be about plot, but Mermaids incredibly obvious surprise ending was insulting. The gore (a lot of worms in blood and some pus oozing tumours) was boring and not particularly nasty. Get Braindead or Dead Alive however you know it best and leave this alone. A Gojira size let down."
1,1 star for calling that a movie 4 stars for good HOME VIDEO,"It's amateur VHS camcorder made and the effects are sometimes not bad sometimes look like a pizza. Bad actors. Looks like a film student job but I've seen worst with violent [...] (aka zombie doom aka infantry of doom).Not deserve the name of movie but a good HOME VIDEO. Go on with Braindead, texas chainsaw or nekromantik and if you looking for japeneese, ringu or kairo are much better and they're a 16mm film instead a video."
4,Awesome Children's Book!,"This is a really sweet book for little girls and their mommies. It has just the right amount of repetition, and the illustrations are absolutely perfect. I'd reccomend this picture book to any young girls looking for a sweet and attention- holding story."
4,"Pleasing, familiar sounds","On a visit to Portland ME, I bought Angry Salad on a suggestion from a relative.The CD is a good one. It's not an entirely new sound, but it makes good listening all the same. Good voice, good style. Thought it might be heavier, but the opening of The Milkshake Song could be on Dawson's Creek. I've not heard any other stuff by them, but I think it could be something to look forward to."
4,yes!!!,"cool,clever,witty,and catchy,these are the words to describe angry salad!pop rock or powerpop whatever it is it's great for taking on drives or sitting on your porch in the summertime!it will put you in a good mood and thats not a bad thing,thats a good thing,ha ha!the lead singers voice is great as well!"
4,Sorry to see them go.,"Angry salad is a great local band. They are originally from Boston, and it was a sad day that blackbird dropped them from the label, and they went their separate ways. Several have formed other bands. I fell in love with my cd almost five years ago, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. It has a good mix of rock, with a few softer songs, and one decent cover. I would definitely recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for something a little different."
4,great rocking roots album,"Angry Salad's self title cd is very much worth getting. They have a great sound, which for me brought to mind two favorites, The Vigilantes of Love and Counting Crows. While some of the songs have a basic message, some are quite deep and impressive (ie-Red Clouds:indians or How Does It Feel too Kill: the Kent State killings in the 70's). The lyrics ring honest and true and never overly trite or cliched. The vocals definitely bring to mind comparisons to Bill Mallonnee (VOL) and Adam Duritz (Crows). This cd is a bargain at amy price."
3,the lead singer sure is cute but look at that tour manager!,yeah the album is good. how many donuts did we go through on this recording? jim? class? anyone?
4,nice album,"I've had this cd for a while now, and I still listen to it (not as much as I used to, but still...). The themes in the lyrics are often suprisingly dark or melancholy and they are mixed in with very catchy, upbeat rhythms. The end result isn't that bad, and in a way it couldn't be better. Words can't describe this album, and that's normally a compliment...I'm not sure what I mean by it. Their songs are all very memorable and my favorites are ""How Does It Feel To Kill"", ""Stretch Armstrong"", and ""Red Cloud"". This band has so much potential."
5,wow.,"I still can't believe this is a debut album. They're by far the most talented group of new musicians I've yet heard.If you pride yourself on being out in front of the pop/rock music bandwagon, don't wait much longer -- this album won't be ranked #14,000 for long. And if you don't care, just buy it and enjoy the music -- ""The Milkshake Song"" is terrific, and only the beginning!"
5,AWESOME new sound!!!!!!!!,"I saw these guys live recently and they are one GREAT new band. This is thier first album on a major record label and I think they will get REALLY BIG. Their first single is called ""The Milkshake Song"" and it ROCKS!!!! Buy this CD and add a little Angry Salad to your diet. :)"
4,Angey Salad is well on their way to the top,"I first heard of Angry Salad when I saw them perform at a local college fest in Boston (their hometown), and they were great! I immediately bought the CD, and I've been playing it very frequently. There's not one bad tune on the entire CD. Keep it up guys!"
4,Power Pop Without All the Bubblegum!,"It's really great to hear a pop punk or power pop band that can use a lot of hooks, but still doesn't sound so thin and hollow (like Mest, Ataris, Showoff, etc.). If these guys continue to grow, their next record will be even better!"
4,This disc rocks!!!!!,"God...I've been waiting for a good pop punk band to sound bigger than the others. Thanks, guys! Keep rockin'!"
5,Duck and Cover -- Good time power pop is back!,"Slipknot may well rue the day they entered the music business, as their ""eclectic"" brand of depresso/psuedo-aggro/metal shows people that their lives really aren't THAT bad, and maybe it's time to feel good or, God forbid, dance.The Fourth Quarter Jinx have come from, virtually, nowhere with this exciting blend of catchy pop-punk and melodic indie-rock. Songs like 'I've Fooled Myself Again' and 'Lucky Valentine' show the Minneapolis trio's penchant for thick vocal tapestries, more impressive still when you consider this IS INDEED only a trio.I expect great things from them in the future."
3,Excellent book for the TKD Historian,"I wanted a bit more explaination of the movements in each pattern and the purpose for them. This book discusses the history of each man for whom a pattern is named after which is great for someone working toward becoming a black belt or an instructor, but it doesn't do much for someone who wants to learn the patterns movements."
3,"Audio quality could definitelybe better, but still a good CD","Great songs! And, for a change, it's refreshing to find a CD that's not re-recordings or, worse, recordings by no name 'artists.' I like this CD, but be aware the audio quality is a bit lacking. It sounds like it was created from vinyl recordings and the gain was a little high. You can hear some distortion on the louder passages.Still, some great recordings."
2,Why?,"I first listened to this on LP after rooting through my Dad's collection. Being a fan of the movies I instantly put it on.After listening through the album I was appaled at what Montengro had done to Morricone's classic spagetti western scores. They seem poor copies in comparison.The only reason I gave it two stars is that the main themes, for example ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", aren't as bad as the rest of the collection. The track ""The Ecstasy of Gold"" is appallingly bad in comparison with the original.In conclusion if you want the spagetti western themes of these three great films your better off getting the originals. If you fancy something different get this."
3,NOT the original motion picture soundtrack .,"This is not the original motion picture soundtrack . I felt disappointed , and a little bet insulted when I first listened to this album . the wild cries in the good , the bad and the ugly theme got replaced with flutes , guitars and drums - not the marching band drums but the beach boys drums - are included in all the tracks , and the macho chants muffled .This is shall we say , the danceable version , the tribute version , the lounge music version , the politically correct version , an elevator music version and to sum it all up , not the original motion picture soundtrack.It still manages to give the illusion of listening to the original, but that's it .Should've paid more attention to other customer reviews , not just the ones on the top.I wouldn't have bought it if I new it was a tribute album .Pick up the originals if you want to relive those wild and fresh scenes from the trilogy.[...]"
1,So glad for being able to previews the songs first.,I am so glad that Amazon provided the ablity to preview the songs to this CD because if they did not; I would have wasted my money.Granted I understand how different composers want to do their own version of the soundtracks to this movie but in all honesty none of the Hugo Montenegro previews I had listen to were remotely enjoyable.Prague philharmonic orchestra and Hollywood Symphony Orchestra do a better job than Mr. Montenegro
3,Three Bullets For Montenegro,"Three of the pieces are rousing and involving with very interesting changes in instrumentation compared to the originals: TGTB&TU, Aces High and The Vice of Killing. The rest are fair to middling. If you've seen the films, the music Maestro Morricone wrote is linked to the images on screen. This linkage is broken, especially in the Story of a Soldier, a heartbreaking, melancholy piece set in a hopeless Yankee prison camp. Hugo's arrangement of this piece does not nearly have the emotional power of the original."
2,"Stale imitation, compared to the originals","Can't think of one good reason why anyone should listen to Montenegro's flat and stale versions of these gorgeous tunes, while all the original and really innovative ones by their composer, Ennio Morricone, are readily available. Don't go for bad imitation, get the real thing!"
1,Good Job Hugo!,"Dear hugo: you did a good job with your own Morricone's version, I grew up listening to both versions:Morricone and Montenegro and I love them.thanks"
3,COLLECTION OF SHORT POPULAR FILM TUNES PRIOR TO 1973,"This album is a collection of short but popular film tunes and goes back several years ranging between 1957 (Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me) to 1972 (Lara's Theme and Love Theme from ""The Godfather""). I especially liked ""In the Heat of the Night"" (Track 11).My question, [Amazon.Com]: Where is Montenegro's music after 1972? There were some really good years during the ""Quad"" experiment in the latter 1970's. Hugo and his son, John, both got into synthesized music (when nearly every sound had to be programmed by hand). How `bout ""Hugo in Wonder-land"" (RCA 1974) and ""Rocket Man - Hugo Montenegro (RCA 1975)?"
2,Does not do justice to the score,"This album is a reworking of the original. It gives the score a pop feel, eliminating what power the music originally had."
3,"dissapointing, but OK","I saw the films and loved all of the the scores except FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. After hereing a cowboy themes version of THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY, I was dissapointed with the combination of pop music and new age. So I went to a mall and asked my dad to buy it for me. I was excited, thinking that it had the original's intensity. No! I laughed when I heard exactly what I had heard in the cowbow cd. I was getting upset untilI heard the third track (which was in the scene of THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY where Eli Whalach is brutally tortured) I calmed down, and was soothed with the good sound.Overall, it is an OK cd with good tracks, but my advice is to stay away from THE ECSTACY OF GOLD and the FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE tracks. They are very bad. IT's worth checking out! PEACE OUT!"
2,"The fake, the fake and the fake","This CD contains re-makings of Morricone's original scores for GBU, FFDM and FOD. To enjoy it, one must abstract entirely from the context of the films and try, a lot, to find something of interest here. Then tracks 1 and 2 will look like a good promise, but that's all. Whoever heard the original may keep this CD away. It's 2 and not 1 star because of tracks 1 and 2."
3,"OK, I guess",Used these to make oyster stew and they're not as nice as fresh oysters and the liquid that the oysters are canned in is very muddy.
3,Hard to line up exactly in center,"I used the Neato label template but still had a hard time printing all six of the labels with the text exactly centered. The thick paper may have shifted during the printing process. The ones that did print in the center were great. I only needed 12 so eventually I got the 12 I needed, but a few partial sheets were wasted."
1,Mini CD Labels,"I definitely should have ordered the Sure Thing Brand, these labels suck and now Im stuck with them. The images and print don't line up when printing and they are always off set. I dont have the time to create a whole new label in the Sure Thing Label software. Live and learn and I'll stay with teh brand name stuff instead of trying to save a couple of dollars."
5,The 'Black Shrike' aka 'Dark Crusader',"Some may not be aware that 'The Black Shrike' and 'Dark Crusader' are one and the same book, with the title changing when Dark Crusader was released in America as The Black Shrike. Or (my memory...), maybe it was changed when Dark Crusader was issued as a paperback. Either way, this particular novel was written when Alistair MacLean was in top form. It's not a complex story in any way. Simple and straightforward. Funny, sometimes simple is best, especially when It's A.M. doing the writing. Of the numerous books written by Mr. MacLean, the first 2/3rds are the best. Yes, they are written mainly for juveniles, but somehow they work well even when read as an adult (can you say ""Harry Potter""?)."
5,This is essential for those interesting in improving health,"This is an excellent reference book on vitamins and other nutritional supplements and a ""must have"" for those interested in learning more about improving their health naturally. It is very well laid out and chock-a-block full of useful information on the dosage, available forms and reasons why each supplement is beneficial. It makes me more confident when I'm shopping for supplements and I'm able to avoid making mistakes buying ""snake oil"" or empty supplements that have little nutritional value. Thank you Dr. Murray"
3,Encyclopedia of Nutritional Supplements,"(See my review on the PDR for Nutritional Supplements.) This has much of the same information as ""The New Encyclopedia of Vitamins, Minerals, Supplements, and Herbs"" by Nicola Reavley (1998 - a newer book). I used these books to look up a list of herbal remedies for a weight loss program, and sadly could not find at least one third of these drugs. The reading is easy and to the point, and well-referenced to articles from medical journals. The first 13 pages consist of an introduction to nutritional supplements. Pages 15 - 413 list drugs under their separate categories with discussion on symptoms of deficiencies, recommended dosages, risks and benefits. Pages 413-489 briefly discuss medical conditions and recommendations for treatment, and then come References (56 pages) and the index (20 pages). I am still looking for a more updated and comprehensive source of information to use in my clinic."
5,Dr. Murray's Books are amazing!,"The book was/ is an amazing resource for the person who wants to understand supplementation, and how it can improve your life. I highly recommend this book and for that matter, any other book by Dr. Murray -"
1,Incomplete out of date,I got this book as it is part of a course I am taking. Has nothing on medicinal mushrooms which has more nutrients than most herbs or plants. Incomplete would not purchase if not required.
3,Leftovers From Elvis,"This RCA hodgepodge of leftover material from the King's 1970 Nashville Marathon has its moments. The best tracks on ""Love Letters From Elvis"" (1971) are the rip-roaring jam of ""Got My Mojo Working,"" a free-wheeling ""Cindy, Cindy"" (featuring terrific guitar work by James Burton) and the gospel song ""Only Believe."" Another gem is the country obscurity ""It Ain't No Big Thing."" Despite his best intentions, Presley's remake of ""Love Letters"" did not improve upon the original. The remaining cuts - especially the pretentious single ""Life"" - should have stayed in the vault."
2,Love Letters from Elvis,"I really love Elvis, but I was disappointed with this CD.The reason being I paid 48.96, for this cd that only has 10 songs on it. I could have gotten the same cd for a cheaper price. I would like to send it back and get one that is cheaper or that has extras with it. As of right now I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have always gotten good service from Amazon. I would like to get my money back or exchange it for a cheaper CD. I will be looking for another cd with more music on it for the same price. I wanted the CD that was not an IMORT. I can't see paying almost $50.00 for cd in a cardboard jacket and insert that is not in English. I'm sorry but I am going to send this back and order one that is sent from the US. Again Amazon has always been good to me, but I just want something I can read (English). I will be ordering any all things ELVIS, I will just watch were it comes from. Thanks, Nancy CannonRE: Love Letters from Elvis CD"
4,Thoroughly Cat-tivating,"I don't care for cats in the least (mostly because I am allergic) but I really liked this book. The pictures and descriptions of Lamu are delightful. Lamu is a magical place, a must-see on the coast of Eastern Africa, and the author brings it to us in great detail. His theory that the cats of Lamu are descendents of a lost breed of cat from ancient Egypt is quite interesting. This is a wonderful book for cat lovers and/or Africanists.Jack Couffer tells a remarkably unlikely story of WWII research into the use of bats to carry small incendiary devices into Japanese cities in ""Bat Bomb: World War II's Other Secret Weapon""."
5,Great book on the Alaskan Bush,"Having been a pilot in Alaska for 25 years and having been lucky enough to be taught to fly by James ""Andy"" Anderson it was hard for me to put this book down until I was through. Once you realize how unassuming Andy is you really appreciate the experiences he has been fortunate enough to have had in a very unique place and time. His unbelievable skill has been finely tuned by many years of daily flying only a few can appreciate. I highly reccommend it to pilots and non-pilots alike. He is truly a ledgend on the Koyukuk River and Brooks Range area of Alaska."
2,Not recommended,"This book is only useful if you want pretty pictures and some prose on a tiny fraction of what other books cover. I was not at all impressed. I think I'm going to sell it on eBay. We read 6 books on the Big Island before going there (I know, a little compulsive). The only two books you need are: Hawaii The Big Island Revealed by Andrew Doughty and Adventure Guide Hawaii The Big Island (Hunter Travel Guides) by Bryan Fryklund & Jen Reeder. The Fryklund/Reeder book is absolutely jam-packed with information. The Doughty is also packed with info and will have a few things the Fryklund book doesn't have, but it's main attribute is that it is an absolute joy to read."
5,GREAT!!!! *****,"The soundtrack to the phantom of the opera is great! If you loved the film then i would reccommend this to you.I must also praise Emmy Rossum, and disagree greatly with one review that says she is not talented. Emmy's voice is not soprano, but appeals to many more people. Personally i am not a great fan of opera, and emmy's voice is beautiful, so therefore the film appeals to more people, Gerald Butler is also great on this soundtrack. The young voices and fresh new looks helps to bring the phantom of the opera up to date! You will love this soundtrack, great to sing along too also!"
4,this soundtrack kicks ass,"Yeah, I don't give a damn about all the Phantom die hards who think that no on else but Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman can do justice to Webber's material. You want to know something? I think Emmy Rossum breathes life into every song, and I'm glad someone else besides Warbly Brightman is singing. Rossum is terrific and not as operaish as Brightman. Also, there's no other way to look at it...Gerard Butler is hot. So's his voice. He's not Crawford, but he's young, sexy, has a good voice that works well with the material, and he's great."
5,"Excellent Sountrack, Excellent Movie and Musical","After I saw the movie, I knew I had to hear it again, so I got this soundtrack. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out it is literally the entire movie on CD. Christine is acted out beautifully, and though the person acting out the Phantom (sorry, I'm not great with names or actors/actresses) doesn't sound like he should be any kind of teacher, he really seems to fit the part after you get used to it.I've nearly worn both CD's out, but I keep coming back... it's addicting!! If you really want to hear a great musical time and time again, I highly suggest Phantom. It's great!!"
4,Love this iconic music,"Whereas this is a recording of the Broadway Musical, you can detect the emotion imparted in the singing. The orchestral performance is superb. There is a problem however. The audio reproduction is not that precise. I suspect that is due to performing the musical on stage rather than in a studio. I still like this album."
1,Not what I expected.,I thought this would have the songs and music- studio style- but instead it is the movie clips with backgroud and actual movie play.
5,Very nice.,"It has beautiful music, it came brand new and three weeks before estimated date of arrival. Overall, I was very pleased."
5,Most excellent music ever created,"This cd is one of the best cd's I have ever listen to in my life. I love Gerard Butler. His voice is so real but perfect. I love the music and listen to it at least once a day. I haven't tired of it yet.I advice anyone, even the people who haven't seen the movie, to buy this cd"
5,Music to calm ones soul,At first I didn't think Gerard Butler had it but after listening with a more rock and roll ear WOW! Now I can't get enough of it. I've listened to Crawfords version and than Butlers and to be honest Crawfords is too soft and sweet. Of course the rest of the music was performed by seasoned singers to which their voices blended beautifully together or solo. Emmy had no problem singing with Gerrys Rock type of style or Patricks great tenor voice.
5,"a wonderful, ""new"" classic","I love the play and I think that the movie does a wonderful job bringing the energy from the stage to the silver screen. The music throughout is wonderful and carries the viewer through a range of emotions that I find to be often lacking in other movies. As a person who grew up listening to musicals, Fred and Ginger, and the 'classics' I think that this is outstanding. All of the actors do an admirable job and as one other response stated this was under appreciated and over criticized. I had my roommate watch this movie, and didn't tell her that I was a musical until opening credits, and she has fallen in love with it. This just goes to show that if anyone has an open mind they can appreciate this movie/music."
3,What a Disappointment,This new recording would be absolutely wonderful if only the two principals could sing. Sigh ...
2,"An anticlimax to the ""Phantom"" Phenomenon","The phantom was good, orchestra very interesting, Emmy Rossum - awful! Her thin, bland and breathy voice was completely incapable of doing justice to the beautiful songs she had the priviledge to sing. It isn't fair to compare her to Sarah Brightman, because, unfortunately she is not in the same league as Sarah Brightman. Her vocals are insufficent to sing the songs, and her range is not good enough to tackle the demand of the pieces. She is extremely beautiful, and sweet to watch.This soundtrack is not a good stand alone cd to listen to. The music without the movie is completely bland and mediocre. As the title states, I believe this movie and the soundtrack were a total anticlimax to entire Phantom Phenomenon. Webber should have taken the opportunity to make the film with Brightman and Crawform, who can do the beautiful music justice."
4,"Nice CD, waited longer than expected for it.....","Very nice CD, but was starting to wonder how soon it would come to me. Just as a was about to send out an email asking, ""...where's my CD...still waiting?"" it came the same day."
1,Skip it,"I was unable to finish one listening to this aural atrocity. After the male lead detroyed ""Music of the night"" it came out of my CD player in into the trash. I was so sorry to see Mr.Webber associated with this travesty. It is complete junk."
2,Stop the screeching!,"What kind of person enjoys this inane caterwalling? The sets were beautiful but the lyrics nearly indecipherable and the music laughable. If you listen to this thing for 5 minutes you've heard it all. The only part of the music that was enjoyable was so unintentionally. I swear to God, about 45 minutes into the film ALW does about 8 bars of a song some of you may remember from the old Doctor Demento show called ""Fishheads."" It went ""Fishheads, fishheads, rolly polly fishheads, fishheads, fishheads, eat them up yum!"" What ever happened to musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar, Oliver, or Fiddler On The Roof?"
2,"I love Gerard Butler, But not this time.","Let me say first that of course I love the original cast album as anyone would a classic. I also adore Gerard Butler but his voice is not clear enough for this role. Often he sounds as if his voice is about to break and that he is spitting while singing into the microphone. Broadways Sam Harris might have been a better choice or even ""Rents"" Christain Mena.Emily is fine in her role and her voice grows on my everyday. I also keep hearing people talk about Minnie Drivers ""Voice"", Its not her people-Read the label.Learn to be lonely is the worst attempt at ""Oscar"" I have ever heard. After 20 years could someone not come up with a better song?It's not all bad but I often find myself turning up the volume to hear the words, Vocals weak in balance with the orchestration."
2,AIIIIEEEEEE!! (do i sound like gerard butler yet??),"those who enjoyed this movie were not concentrating on mr. butler's voice--they were probably staring at his ass.christine, same thing. emmy rossum is UNBELIEVABLY and EXCEPTIONALLY weak. and it's not like i'm being bitter. i can't sing...but i do think that there has been better for christine. and is she a result of the metropolitan opera? because i am very disappointed. gawd, even the girl who plays meg sounds better.the only competent person i found was raoul. patrick wilson can sing, and did very well. and quite frankly, i don't care much for raoul so he did nothing to salvage this recording.the orchestrations were pretty good, hence my two stars.one opportunity to immortalize this unbelievable play--and they chuck it down the gutter.andrew lloyd webber is a genius, and i hear geniuses can be a little eccentric. this defies me. maybe he's been taking monotonus muck pills from joel shumacher and his ""young and sexy"" cast."
4,good,"I have heard some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses."
5,Phantom of the Opera,This is the best movie! Got it for a gift for Christmas and we have watched it over and over!
5,Excellent movie,"My first time seeing the musical ""Phantom of the Opera"" and what a great viewing experience. Had to download the soundtrack so I can have the music while travelling on the road."
5,phantom of the opera is great!,"I absolutely love this soundtrack! Even better, my children do too!I plan to buy the movie in the near future. I highly recommend this soundtrack if you loved the movie."
1,They lost their one chance to immortalize Phantom...,"For starters, I haven't seen the movie. I'm just a multimedia store employee that was excited to see a promotional copy of the new Phantom soundtrack. Well...I have to say Sir Webber and others took what is considered the most famous musical and butchered it. The female voices in the movie are great. However the male voices leave more than a little to be desired.If you listen to the soundtrack you can't help but feel that the man playing the Phantom is none other than someone who smokes WAY too much. His voice is gruff and unfeeling throughout the disk. Raoul's voice however reminds one of an 80's metal band rock-ballad in his cheesy way of singing.And of course who could miss the electric waa-waa guitar during ""The Phantom of the Opera.""I don't think I can forgive Sir Webber for this."
3,Get the DVD,"Fans of POTO absolutely HAVE to get the DVD. First of all, it's the only one available. Secondly, despite a few flaws, it IS visually stunning. While you're watching it, the wonderful spectacle is everything. I found Emma Rossum quite believable and Gerald Bulter fullfilling the role he was cast for (a young, sexy phantom - WHY is another matter!) However, it must be admitted that their voices simply don't measure up to either of the available cast albums (where actors are picked for their SINGING ability). Butler has some good moments, but by the Phantom's Lair he's not even singing.So, get the DVD and stick with the London or Canadian (my favorite) cast CDs."
3,Only a selected few can thoroughly enjoy the sountrack,One can only enjoy the soundtrack straight through if they have seen the movie. The singing is lacking in several areas and there is no denying it. But the acting and cinamatography is absolutely magnificent. The acting and directing makes up for the lack of vocal range. The actors pulled off the nescessites of the characters and were very compelling. If you personally had a good movie experience then you are guaranteed to enjoy the soundtrack. Of course no one can live up to the superb vocal ranges of Sara Brightman or Michael Crawford so the movie production was a ballsy gamble and was expected to be under much scrutiny to begin with. But hey webber was part of this production so I trust his judgement.
5,Simply Fabulous!,This is by far the best Phantom production I have ever seen. I was skeptical when I heard Gerard Butler had no vocal training prior to Phantom and Emmy Rossum was so young. But those objections were completely wiped away when I saw the movie.I highly recommend this movie and it's cast. Enjoy!
2,Return To The Original,"I think what made POTO such a wonderful musical from the start were the actors/singers Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. The production team chose a cast that actually fit the idealism of the two main character not just in acting but also through the power of their voices. Butler and Rossum failed in this attempt. Both of their vocal rangers were incredibly weak and sloppy, nor did they possess the true quality of an aria. I was impressed with the movie in general but that's the extent of my good opinion. So, my advice, if you've just been introduced to POTO then seek out the original."
5,PHANTOM ROCKS,"Yes, I'm a twelve year old who is obsessed with Phantom of the Opera. The music is so beautiful, and mysterious! I like both the Broadway/London cast recording, but if you want a slightly more modern version, I'd go for the movie recording, but the OBC cast is great, too! Comparing them is hard, and in my opinion, it's 50/50. They have their good points and their bad points. If it was me, I'd buy both!"
5,"ACCEPT IT, BUTLER HAS A GREAT VOICE AND CAPTURED PHANTOM...","I own the original soundtrack and love it to death ,only its too short...I wanted the exteneded version but it seems pricy, this one may be my solution, however my favorite song, ""Masquerade"" appears to be missing , or is it just hidden? (Someone reply)Apart from that I highly reccomend everything POTO.The companion, soundtrack, movie when it comes out, seeing the show, etc.Finally, Those who hate Gerard Butler's voice as phantom... I'd like to see those people try to compete with his amazing voice. There are those who blame the crew of POTO (2004) for not getting a better actor. I see those who gave the movie 1 or 2 stars, in my opinion , as stubborn people who need to just accept things the way they are, and should not encourage people to follow."
1,Not the Italian Version AGAIN! Plus follow up...,"Like the other two reviewers before me, I have received the English language version. I have emailed caiman.com and await their response - which I will post here......................................I will not bore readers with the gory details. Suffice to say that I would never deal with Caiman.com again (their logo is apt - a alligator) but Amazon enforced their refund guarantee and have been brilliant in customer service.Now AN IMPORTANT NOTE: The REAL ITALIAN LANGUAGE VERSION is being released March 30th by SONY. Details are at www.soundofmusic.de"
1,Buyer's Beware!!,If you decide you want the Phantom of the Opera (Italian Version) as stated on their order..you will NOT receive it. Instead you will get the English Version like I did a few days ago...Buyer's beware!!!
5,Phantom of the Opera Movie and CD,Received both movie and the soundtrack CD. I was not disappointed. They are amazing and beyond my expectations! I love the songs and listen to them frequently. Will definitely be purchasing the written music book for the piano so that I can enjoy playing them also.
4,A joy to own.,"I had seen the Broadway production some time ago and did not like it as much as others I've seen. I recently saw the movie and liked it much more. I did not care for Gerard Butler's ""shouting/singing"", but Emmy Rossum's pure and beautiful voice more than makes up for it. My kids like it too. I play it over and over again."
5,Not the original....Thank God,"I think that everyone who keeps saying crap about Emmy Rossum needs to get there facts straight about Sarah Brightman, who I am not a fan of. Andrew Lloyd Webber discovered Sarah while she was singing in a bar, not an opera house. Emmy has had so much more opera training than Sarah ever had and she doesn't sound like she has a stick up her butt. Also, Gerard Butler does a wonderful job of playing the phantom. When you hear the songs in the context of the film, the emotion is really captured in the words and the way he is singing them, unlike Michael Crawford, who just gives a flat performance.All in all, I loved the movie and the music"
3,What happened????,"I had high hopes for this and I must say I was impressed...by the orchestra. I do not understand why anyone casting this movie ever thought that Emmy Rossum sounded like an operatic soprano....or even a moderately good singer. Her lower range is OK, but the upper range is strained and thin, with no spin to it.She really sounds like she is struggling for the notes at the end of ""Think of Me"" and they put so much effect on her voice in the title song ""Phantom of the Opera"" that it is obvious the notes aren't there. I understand she is young, but I am very dissapointed. Gerard Butler is Ok, a little too ""rock"" for the part. I was impressed with Raoul, however. I can only say I hope the spectacle of the movie outweighs the letdown of the voices."
2,Terrible Singers,"Overall, this soundtrack, and the movie, are a pale imitation of one of the best musicals ever. First, most of the people singing in the movie and on this soundtrack are TERRIBLE! Gerard Butler doesn't come close to having the epic range of Michael Crawford, and the supporting singers are no better. The only bright spots on this CD are Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, and (of all people) Minnie Driver. Unfortunately, they are drowned out by the bad singers around them. The worst song of the lot is the title song. Butler is just horrible. Don't waste your time on this CD, buy the original cast recording instead."
1,Phantom 2004 vs Crawford and Brightman Original,"The artists vocals in the movie version sound weak, horrific and scratchy compared to the Original London Cast Recording. It's a shame that the talent in the new movie version just can't sing. I'm a fan of this show and purchased the 2004 CD. Side by side with the London version, if I could return the 2004 version, I would. It's a travesty that the vocals are so poor on the movie version. If you want a CD to treasure, buy one of the original London Cast Recordings and avoid the movie soundtrack completely."
5,~~~ Sensually Haunting ~~~,"I've yet to see the movie, (gasp! Can you imagine?) but saw the play at the Orpheum Theatre in New Orleans. Ohh, I cannot imagine a better place to see it, for the theater itself is very old & simply lovely. Once you step inside, you know ghosts roam the halls of that theater once night falls.But back to the soundtrack- so beautiful it gives you chills. I won't overanalyze or over-review, but if you've always been enchanted w/ the Phantom itself, the cd will capture you as well."
5,The Phantom of the Opera (2004 Movie Soundtrack.,I listen to this over and over. Enjoy it VERY much. I am always happen with what I receive from Amazon.com.
5,Sound quality seems good,The songs seem to be of good quality and I'm able to move them around to all of my devices so I never need to be without music.
4,"Holy cow, Get it now!!!","This is an incredible rendition of the musical; almost all of the actors wonderful. Emmy Rossum is the young talented Christine we've all been waiting for, and Gerard Butler surpasses Crawford himself with a deep baritone voice. Even Patrick Wilson (Raoul) is a more than decent singer. My one protest is that Minnie Driver had to have her voice dubbed, when she can clearly sing her on her own. Phantom ""phans"" will be a little disapointed to learn ""Notes"", ""Stranger Than You Dreamt It"", Raoul's section of Angel of Music, and ""Why So Silent"" have been cut from the album for time issues (but they are all in the film). If you really want it, get the extended version. But otherwise, Thumbs up!"
4,good,"I have heard some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses. Really well done."
4,Michael Who?,"Okay, before you come after me with torches, allow me to say this; I actually Purchased the Original Broadway Soundtrack when it was first available On Cassette Tape! Okay? Now then, I must also add this; Gerard kicks Michael's [...], musically.As it has been said, Mr. Butler does Not go ""falsetto"" on us, and does not in any way attempt ""trickery"" with his voice. The man strained his vocal chords for our titillation, and therefore deserves our respect and many kudos. (Okay, okay; Michael was stuck with the stage presentation and Needed some trickery to 'save' his voice so he could continue just Speaking in real life; I get it.) Either way, I'd Much rather be stuck in the underground catacombs with Gerard than Michael Any day, or Night for that matter!"
4,Gerard Butler - The guy can sing.,"This soundtrack is awesome. Every time I listen to Gerard Butler in Point of No Return, it gives me goosebumps. He brings more emotion to the role of Phantom than I have ever heard before. Although I think the movie was visually pleasing, it still suffered from a dumb storyline. I also thought it rushed and confused viewers who weren't familiar with the plot.Anyway, I would this 5 stars except for the last song. The song would have worked great in Hope Floats, but it sure doesn't work here....unless they want to relocate the Phantom story to Oklahoma."
3,BUY THE ORIGINAL CAST RECORDING FIRST!!!,"I just recently got a copy of this soundtrack to the Phantom movie. I found it okay, but it isn't as great as the original cast recording! I was very very very disappointed in the Phantom.. He CAN'T SING!! Andrew Lloyd Webber really made a mistake in casting.. Michael Crawford or a actor from the stage show should have been casted.. I am so disappointed. :( Other than that, the cd is okay.. I found Patrick Wilson really great as Raoul!! The managers were good too!! I really hope the movie is a whole lot better than the soundtrack.. I suggest to anyone who hasn't heard Phantom yet, to buy the original cast recording."
1,dogs of music,"Why anyone would subject themselvs to this is beyond me.Gerard butler cant sing, he goes out of tune and yells his way through the more difficult bits. Rossum is a dissapointment, her voice lacks power and is quite thin with little emotion. The woman who performs carlotta is the only one with any talent here. Trust Americans and the french to foul it up. Dont buy this mediocre pop-rock cd."
3,Two out of Three Isn't Bad,"While I enjoyed the film and think the majority of the cast did very well, I do not feel the Phantom character was well done. I'm not a Michael Crawford fan, so it's not an issue of comparison. I did notice that the orchestra was louder each time the Phantom sang and I can see why. Some of the notes were croaked. Listen and you'll hear it. Don't misunderstand, the acting Mr. Butler did was fine and he definitely had chemistry with Rossum. But someone should've dubbed his voice. As such, his contribution to the soundtrack is not as shining as that of his co-stars.The rest of the cast was fantastic in all ways in the film and their work is reflected in the soundtrack. Emma Rossum is truly going to be a great star. She is not too young to play Christine as some have insinuated. She was dewy and angelic, with a voice as clear as a bell and not annoyingly operatic for us non-opera fans."
1,Horrible!!!!,"I bought this CD because I wanted to compare it to the original broadway soundtrack. What a waste of money! [...] in my opinion, these folks cannot sing. Maybe I feel this way because I'm such a huge fan of the original with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. Emmy Rossum's voice is so weak. Comparing her to Sarah Brightman is like comparing Whitney Houston to Britney Spears! It's weak and not even pretty to me. She struggles with the soaring notes and even great musical accompianment does not help her. The phantom is disappointing as well. The phantom's voice should be seductive and soothing. When Michael Crawford sings ""The Music of the Night"", it can almost put you in a dreamlike state. This guy who sings the phantom role in the movie couldn't seduce anybody!!! I couldn't find one song on this CD that didn't annoy me. [...] Don't waste your money. Buy the original broadway version with REAL talent."
1,very low quality,Our family saw the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway in NYC recently so we were excited to bring home the CD we ordered from here. I was on an hour trip to work so I decided to listen to it on the way. I was very displeased when I tried listening because the sound had to be turned up to 17 when I normally listen comfortably to the radio at 6. The quality was not good and the sound was barely hearable. Unless they come out with another CD I would NOT recommend the movie version to buyers. I would recommend buying it on itunes or buying the Original Cast version that Amazon has to offer.
2,"It's okay, but definitely not the original","The singers aren't as good as the original stage folks, and they should not have changed the arrangements of some of the songs. Other than that, the movie achieves complete mediocrity."
4,Phantom of the Opera,"I really liked it, my favorite songs were on there and including the new song. The new song is my favorite of all time now, I highly recommend this to anyone."
3,Oh no another Chicago!,"Just as film ruined ""Chicago the Musical,"" the soundtrack on this is nearly as bad. (Could be worse, they could have cast Richard Gere as the Phantom. Oh my God, I cringe at the thought.) In any case the music is unmistakably ""Phantom"" and wonderful, but the voices are not up to professional standards, in fact, they are not even close. Save your money and buy the Original Broadway sountrack. Having seen the stage performance a number of times with very different actors I have never walked away from the theater unsatisfied. The voices in the film version on this soundtrack are simply too ordinary and do not do the legend any justice."
2,I would reccomend the Original Broadway Cast instead,"The Phantom Of the Opera can NEVER be considered bad, but the original broadway cast is significantly better. Most people say this is because of the voices, and I do agree that Michael Crawford(the original broadway cast Phantom) beats Gerard Butler by a mile, but in my opinion thats not why the OBC(original broadway cast) is so much better. In this, many of the lyrics song in the OBC are spoken on this CD, therefore sounding like a poem. Also, in this one you are un-able to hear the ""excitment"". Like on the OBC, you can actual hear the chandelier falling and its quite exciting.To conclude, I would definitly purchase the OBC atleast before purchasing this one."
1,A shameful way to treat Lloyd Webber's masterpiece,"As a great phan of the stage production, I was excited about the movie adaptation - until I heard about the casting. Despite my deep reservations, I was intrigued about the quality of the movie cast - until I actually listened to the soundtrack.Admittedly Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson (as the Phantom, Christine and Raoul respectively) are not as bad as I thought they would be, but they are NOWHERE in the same league as the original stars, Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman and Steve Barton (or for that matter any successive stage actor in any of the various productions around the world). The orchestrations are sweeping and grand, but I can't help but think what could have been if trained singers were cast in the main roles (at least the main two roles - Patrick Wilson is the only trained singer in the bunch)."
4,Enjoyable,"I have hears some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses."
4,"New vs. Old, Movie vs. Play","I totally agree with M. Menzer, you are right on. I've seen the movie twice and the play twice. I came into the movie very aprehensive. Yes Gerard Butler is not Michael Crawford and yes their were some parts were you were like that doesn't sound like it should. But I don't feel in this day and age Crawford could have pulled it off on screen, he's to old. Butler was amazing, his acting tremendous. Sarah Brightman amazing as she is also could not have pulled it off, she's also to old. Emma Rossum though looked the part and did a beautiful job given her age. And the orchestra phenonenal, I'm actually scared to go see it live again because of the much much smaller orchestra. Just remember when comparing voices, especially with the phantom, he was a great teacher, its never said that he's a great singer maybe think of it that way. Also, when I hear the music is still think of Crawford and Brightman, but the image I come back to is Butler and Rossum."
2,"great orchestra, weak singing","First of all let me just say that I grew up (honestly, i'm only 16) listening to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford as the lead vocals to the soundtrack and also that I plan on majoring in music. So right away my standards were very high. The girls voice (whoever plays Christine) was not as bad as the mens voices combined. Honestly, they had NO power in their voices nor did they have emotion. I felt like I was listening to my 8th grade choir concert, no one had any liveliness in their voices. If you want to hear something great, get the origional London Cast version."
3,CD,"I love Gerard Butler. That's why I purchased the cd. But, I would have preferred to have just the songs instead of listening to the whole performance."
5,"Phantom of the Opera, Motion Picture Sound Track","I ordered this for my son, he is a big fan of Phantom. The recording is quite nice and not as expensive as the original sound track from the play, which I already have. I would recommend it, especially for a younger audience who probably would not get that much out of the original version."
4,One more review of the singing performances,"One more comment regarding the vocal performances: I agree that Christine and the Phantom have weaker voices than the actors from the London cast, but they have one major point in their favor: THEY DON'T HAVE SEVERE INTONATION PROBLEMS!!!I can barely stand to listen to Sarah Brightman because she goes so horribly flat! The only reason why the Phantom cd have liked her was because he also was tone-deaf. The film version does not offend in this regard.Granted, Andre and Firmin cdn't sing on key in the film version either, but at least they are minor characters. It's important for the leads at least to stay on pitch.Also, I wd say that the actors in the film gave better performances because their acting was much better. The Phantom was passionate but not whiney, and you cd believe Christine's naivete."
5,The Best Music Ever....,I just love listening to this CD.... over and over again....why do you think I purchased it? Just can't get enough... thank you!
5,The phantom of the opera movie and soundtrack are great.,"I never went to see or even hear an opera.when I the movie i was blown away. it wasn't a corny musical, it was the best thing i've even seen/heard. The soundtrack is equally great."
5,I play the album everyday.,"But I love this movie. It will all be one of my favorite movies of all times. This one and ""Meet Joe Black."" I just wish the Phantom could be loved. If there was such a man. People should be loved for what is on the inside, if that is beautiful, then it is not hard to love that person. But this is just me."
4,If you loved the movie . . . (which I did),". . . you'll love this CD. I think the music is simply awesome. However, the CD includes some parts of the movie that included dialogue along with the music, so that's a little distracting. ANdrew Lloyd Webber is a musical genius and this CD is a must for his fans! By the way-- the movie was spectacular as well!"
2,No Comparison to The Original Broadway Cast.,"For those of you that like the movie cast, great. But I do take exception to those that pick apart Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, saying that they are ""too old"". Well, yeah. NOW they are!! When Sarah Brightman originated the role in 1986, she wasn't much older than Emmy Rossum! This movie should have been done in 1989-1990. Gerard Butler is no Michael Crawford, as his vocals are choppy and forced, and make me wince to listen to. Take a good, long listen to the Original, and then see what you think. The differences are like night and day."
3,Mediocre at best!,"Loved the film ... the cinematography was wonderful, the costumes were fantastic. Emmy is beautiful and a wonderful actress, but she's NOT an opera singer. Patrick is pretty to look at; too bad he can't act or sing. Gerard was perfect I think; great actor, just the right 'edge' to his voice to be convincing. The new orchestrations are lush and just right. I was most impressed with Miranda and Minnie, and quickly got over the fact that Minnie's voice was dubbed for the singing; she's a marvelous comedic actress and has been overlooked for far too long. I probably won't listen to his more than a few times; pity, really. I had such high hopes!"
1,Kill me before I watch this again.,"1. They redid the orginal plot some, not that it effected the show much, but it was dispointing.2. Emmy can sing and act, but she was horribly micasted. Christine's part requires more than just hitting the notes.3. The Phantom's disfigurement looked like a sunburn. I laughed when I saw it, I mean, did they really not have the ability to make it look ugly?4.Gerald Butler has no talent. He can't sing, and the only time the part fit was when he was mad. His songs made me cry when I realized how bad the auditions must have been to cast him.5. Is it just me or does his hair change from blonde to black in some scenes?6. They took out Meg Giry's famous ending pose with the mask."
1,Terrible singing!!,"I have not seen the movie, but heard the soundtrack being played while I was shopping in a bookstore last night. The singing was so bad, that I had to find out what it was and why the store was playing it. When I was told it was the soundtrack from the recent movie, I was astounded that such awful singing was (a) filmed in a musical and (b) released in a soundtrack.I did have the pleasure of hearing Michael Crawford sing the title role several years ago when the touring show came to Milwaukee. In my opinion, he should have been in the movie.This soundtrack (and I suspect the movie as well) is nothing less than dreadful. Don't waste your time or money on it."
1,Disappointed,"I saw four different phantoms in four different performances. While each performer brought their own talents, to me, there was only one phantom, Mr. Crawford. That being said, it did not stop me from appreciating the other phantoms... with the expection of this phantom. I felt the casting was off for this movie and soundtrack and they really missed the opportunity to cast amazing talent for their vocal excellence and not their box office credibility or for whatever reason they were cast.I understand Christina's talent only came to light when her ""angel of darkness"" came into her spirit, however, this actress/singer did not improve, at least not to me. While the performances were okay, it was a let down to me, who appreciated the purity of the live performance.Still, I am not sorry to have experienced it, but, for me, it is a listen to once and store kind of soundtrack, while the original broadway cast or the other cast productions I listen to over and over."
3,The Phantom...,"I love the music. I didnt realise, however, that this cd is the entire movie, not just the music. It is rather annoying to skip parts of the tracts to get past the talking, but I still like it."
4,Great Music!,"Wonderful sound and great music, of course. Others have gone into detail on all of that. The one thing I didn't care for, on this and the soundtrack with Sarah Brightman, is that it is like watching the movie or play without the video. I actually would have just preferred the music - that's why I bought the soundtrack. If I wanted to hear folks talking and introductory bits, I'd just as soon watch the movie. That's just my preference, I'm sure others feel differently. I just wanted to mention this, as it was something I did not realize about the soundtrack before I purchased it."
5,Enjoyable and lovely...................,"I've never seen the Broadway Production of this show and as of yet haven't seen the moveie, but believe me I'm going to see this movie as soon as I can. After listening to Learning to be Lonely I was in tears, I really felt for Erik the Phantom, and the girl who did Christine .Her voice was absolutely fantastic,she added a light,but very distinctive accent that I really enjoyed. Gerard might have a different technique than Michael Crawford but this a movie people it's going to be different sounding than the Broadway Musical. I have listened to both versions and enjoy both of them for there different sound and technique,and in way I'm glad for it Sara and Michael to me would be too old to really play the movie well, I think that it needed young blood and it got it. I can't wait to see this movie and I will definately be buy it in DVD when it comes out."
4,Soundtrack stands on its own,"I'm a huge fan of the origianl cast, and listened to the original soundtrack until I completely wore it out. I just got the movie soundtrack and I enjoy that version as well.Gerard Butler is not Michael Crawford. I love Crawford as the Phantom, but from hearing Butler's vocals, I think he brings his own life to the character. I don't think you can compare the two performances because they're two different people with two different styles. Same for Ms. Rossum. I don't think Gerard Butler deserves to be bashed simply because he's not Michael Crawford. He did a fine job and I can't wait to see the movie."
5,The Phantom of the Opera,"First movie I paid to see three times. The third time I just wanted to enjoy the whole experience alone. The story, acting, music and costumes were captivating. Gerard Butlers performance was breath taking. The casting was so perfect - and the actors were so believable. I found myself feeling all kind of emotion and totally drawn into the plot. I personally feel that this motion picture far out performs so many of the ones critics rave about today. Hopefully we will see alot more of Gerard Butler, his acting ability is incredibly excellent and what a handsome gentleman too."
2,"Good vocals, but lose the dialogue","I doubted the movie could match the performance of Crawford/Brightman, and boy was I right. The Phantom sounds like an extra playing the fullback in a made-for-TV movie. The ""duh"" and growl in his voice after hearing Crawford is almost criminal. In addition, they simply lifted the soundtrack out of the movie. Each selection is a couple of minutes of dialogue followed by the musical number. I consider this a moderate waste of CD plastic. Get the broadway show recording, it's ten times the quality."
1,NO,"Any true fan of the show who knows the original London recording, has seen the show on Broadway or in London, and has any idea of what good singing is will not like this recording. [...]"
2,That's It?,"Let me get this straight-- you have your pick of all the outstanding, talented people in the world who have ever played or ever wanted to play these roles and we get... this? I was underwhelmed. I saw the move last week, and with the exception of Phantom and Christine, I loved it. The supporting actors are marvelous, Minnie Driver saves the show and the ensemble in ""Masquerade"" is unmatched. But Butler and Rossum make amature mistakes (simple things like lack of support through phrases and horrible diction choices) that simply cannot be ignored (believe me, I tried).In a show that is known for its music, the vocal ability should be the top priority, and we simply don't get that from this one.Stick with the Original Cast recording. They did it right the first time."
2,A Bit Underwhelmed,"This was probably the most disappointing soundtrack of a musical that I have ever heard. The cast was not nearly mature enough, vocally speaking, to take on Weber's score. If I hadn't known the original soundtrack, I probably wouldn't have had the patience to sit through this entire album. I'd save your money and buy the original broadway version - now THERE'S a cast with talent."
1,I almost cried when I first heard it...,"I didn't cry because it was moving, I cried because it was AWFUL! Listening to a few of the stage recordings by different singers I can honestly say that all of them are better this. Gerard Butler (Phantom) and Emmy Rossum (Christine) have butchered some of broadways-best songs. Butler's voice is tolerable in 'Down Once More' and 'All I Ask of You- Reprise' but sounds completely awful in the other songs, especially 'Music of The Night'. To think that Rossum is supposed to be a better or equal singer than the woman singing for Carlotta is laughable. Rossums voice is shaky and out of tune. The only songs worth listening to are 'Down Once More', 'All I Ask of You- Reprise' and 'Masquerade'.I have been waiting to hear this soundtrack for so long and now it's just sad. I would have never thought that Andrew Lloyd Webber would butcher his own music!This could have been a wonderful soundtrack if not for the awful singing voices of Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler"
1,Disappointing.,"This cd does not live up the the original cast recording. I wish I didn't buy it. I have seen the stage musical three times and anyone of those stage actors would have done a better job than anyone on this cd. The ""actor/singer"" cast as the Phantom is a poor choice, his singing [...] makes me cringe. I was looking forward to seeing the film. I am crossing my fingers that his singing will be better on film. The actress cast as ""Christine"" is a fine singer and ""Raoul"" does a decent job. Really a disappointment!!! [...]"
1,The Best & the Worst,"This is the greatest orchestral life the Phantom has ever had, the score is lush and thrilling and gigantic, but it is matched with some of the worst voices to ever be featured in a film musical.Get the movie on DVD but if you want a sountrack to listen to in your car get the Original London Cast Recording, it is still the best so far."
5,All that I expected,"I had had the movie (2004) of ""The Phantom of the Opera) on DVD and recently watched it again after sometime and enjoyed it like the first time. I wanted the music from the movie - especially Emma Russum - so ordered this and it is as expected. I have in my vehicle and enjoy on regular basis."
2,Wouldn't purchase this over the original.,"When my sister requested this soundtrack, I had high hopes. After a few moments, however, we were both hunting out the original Broadway version. I haven't seen the movie, but this CD sucks."
3,"It was good, but not better than the original.","Having seen the original Phantom with M. Crawford, and S. Brightman, I have to say that the singing on the music is not as good. But, it is good. I am saddened however, that they could not find someone that would have the comic ability and the singing ability suitable for the role of Carlotta. Minnie Driver is funny. At the least, they could have gotten her a better lip synching coach. THAT, was horrible. It was so evident that she was not singing, I could barely stand to watch her lypsinc. It reminded me of Milli Vanilli. When she wasn't lip synching, she was a pleasure to watch.I love this musical. I am glad that I have the dvd. Kudos to all involved. You did your best. And it is very good. But, not the better than the original."
4,not bad!,"I think that the cd was purdy good. U can hear all of the swordfighting and stuff... its pretty tight.I think that the Canadian Cast is the best.... but Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum do a pretty good job. I am an official Phantom-Phan, so I know. I think the Emmy Rossum did better than Sarah Brightman. Gerard Butler was definetly more sexy, but I must say that Michael Crawfor has a better voice. But I Think that Gerard Butler did an amazing job, considering he hadn't had any vocal training until he got the role as the phantom in the movie. I am a soprano, and I know how hard it is to train to sing professionally. THIS GUY DID GOOD!I think you should give it a try.One warning... on the song Past the Point of No Return, their voices don't match really well... but besides that... its awesome!"
2,Phantom of the Opera,I ordered a used copy of the CD Phantom of the Opera. The music is fine however the case was in disrepair when I got it in that I could not close the lid properly however it was used and perhaps next time new is better.
5,Phantom of the opera music is the best!!!!,"When you first hear the word opera you think oh,those high scheachy notes that hurt my ears.Well it this movie it is totaly the opposite ,Emmy Rossums voice is so smooth ,even her high notes is nice.I love this music ,I really love how the music is nice ,and it has a meaning in the words too. It's really awesome !!"
3,"Pretty neat, but it gets old fast.","Instrumental smorgasboard. Lots of cool sounds, beats and rhythms. However...I listened to it once, and I don't plan on listening to it again for a month or two.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad DVD-A release. It's just that it lacks replay value. Once you have heard this on a good 5.1 surround system (speakers should be high quality and placement should be precise), you are done with it for a while.I've never seen them ""in concert,"" and I've heard that it's easier to appreciate this DVD-A release if you've seen them on stage.So, for those of you who have not seen their live act...I don't recommend this disk until you do."
4,Gaurav,Simply Awesome... Still I am giving it a 4 because if one has seen it live and then listens to this CD one can enjoy it more. This CD is great and is much better to listen if you have seen it live since you can related it much better to the performance.. BMG ROCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
5,Incrediblie,"The show was an unbelieveable experience, and now the CD. The CD brings backs scenes from the show, and it's a different kind of music that anyone will enjoy. Get it, and don't miss the show, it's worth it."
5,Outstanding....,"Was a little skeptical about the CD, having seen the show in Vegas first I thought the CD might be a letdown...but no way. If you've seen the show and liked it, you'll love the CD. A couple tracks are a little tame for my taste, but as a whole, the disc ROCKS !!"
4,This is good stuff...,"...if you're in Vegas and have a chance to see the show at the Luxor, by all means do. By most accounts it is the best show of the four major cities where BMG performs.As for the music, it is pretty good stuff as far as ambient tunes are concerned. However, there are perhaps three or four tracks you can listen to with regularity, and not want to subsequently use the CD as a frisbee. This music (while not a soundtrack) is very definitely geared towards the visual effects present in the stage show, and frankly is almost identical to the show tunes.Thus several of the tracks have beats and rythms which will wear on you if you don't have the visuals to go with it. All in all a fun collection of music though. Definitely worth the money. [....]"
2,"If you liked ""The Complex"", but want more drums, here you go","After seeing the Complex Rock Tour, I was blown away by the Blue Man Group. When I ordered the tour video, I also ordered ""Audio,"" and it blew me away even more! If you want something a little more raw, and with a lot more percussion, than ""The Complex,"" you NEED this CD! It's a little less polished and doesn't have vocals getting in the way. Make sure your subwoofer's warmed up and CRANK IT! This CD has to be on any percussion fans top 10 list."
4,Very inovative and entertaining,"The inovative sounds this group can create from mostly PVC instruments blows me away. If you like sound moving around your 5.1 system this recording will not disappoint. Do not misinterprut my leading comments about sound here however, because this is music, with several traditional instruments creating a contemporary jazz style (just not the same ole stuff). The bottom line is if you like rythum, fun and creativeness to permeate your music you can not do without this recording. This is a DVDA, but if you like Picaso style art, you'll also like the stills, and if you have patience, play the interview first."
4,An excellent first album,"This is Blue Man Groups first album, It is NOT the audio tracks from their show, it is an expanded version of the tracks you may have heard at their shows. I like it, and would not mind hearing it every so often. My personal favorites are Tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13. Give this and their other album a shot, if you like unusual, yet catchy music, this is definitely an album you should buy."
4,Very well done,"I've been to their show in both Chicago and New York, and thought this reflected the style and energy of the live performance, without making it a true soundtrack. I agree that it needs to be cranked up to be truly appreciated."
2,Disappointed!,"I was really looking forward to this Audio DVD. Upon arrival I immediately had to play it and was expecting this tremmendous sound that was going to blow me away, and nice visuals to accompany the music. It just was not there. All the songs are so simmilar with the clammering of tinker toys that it almost becomes annoying, and this is coming from someone who has seen them 2X. I wish they would have had someone take pictures that were not from the 2nd balcony. If someone were to sit down to listen and watch this without having been to a performance, I am most certain they would not go. They need a better visual representation of what a performance is like. A slide show simply does not cut it."
2,Blue Man Group Audio DVD,"i do not like this DVD. i thought i was getting a DVD of Blue Man group showing them playing their instruments. also i thought they would show how the Blue Man Groug made their instruments, etc.. i was hopeing to see the Blue Man Group playing some of their music. well, i was so wrong. this DVd was a waste of my money and time. carol"
2,cd/dvd,items were good I thought it was a dvd of there show but its just pictures with music MY mistake I guess
2,Something is missing...,"I bought Blue Man Group's second CD called ""The Complex"" before I bought this one. The big difference between the 2 cds is that The Complex had vocals on most of the songs. Without the vocals, like this cd, I find Blue Man Group kind of boring. I guess when you're watching their music in a live show, you get into it, but just listening to it gets boring without more mental stimulation such as vocals. I do have to give Blue Man Group that their rythms on this cd are very good."
2,Blue Man is NOT what you think it is.,"The blue man group experience cannot be summed up in words. Obviously it cannot be summed up through video. This DVD is misleading in that you think you are going to see the Blue Man Group perform, but instead you find that it is a bunch of still pictures with music from there CD. I love Blue Man Group but I was very dissappointed that I could not show my friends, family and myself what an extraordanary performance these guys put on. So go out about by the CD its the same thing only you can carry it around with and its cheaper."
5,Holy Cow!,"I saw the show last week in Chicago at the Briar Street Theater. Words are inadequate to describe what I saw, felt, and heard, but here goes: I was filled with joy and awe at the talent I witnessed both in the performances, the music and the BMG message(s)-- social, political, the human condition, which are delivered sometimes subtly and not so subtly. This is unbelieveable talent, imagination and craftsmanship on a modern par with Mozart or Beethoven in its creativity, power and courage. Don't miss the show if you are able to see it, but the music on this album is amazing and not to be missed, either. What DNA has wrought!"
5,"So, far, it's my favorite album of 2000...",I've been waiting patiently for this album's release since catching the Blue Men in Boston in 1997. It was well worth the wait.The world needs more percussion driven music with copious amounts of Chapman Stick! :-)
1,DVD Audio sound quality,"I already owned and loved the CD and after some thought, I ordered audio DVD as well, just to enjoy the tracks in better quality. The DVD contains surround (5.1) mix, 24 bit / 192 kHz, which is pretty neat all by itself. Unfortunately, couple of the tracks contain some pretty loud annoying clicks that should not be there. Also, the music is mastered quite silent with plenty of headroom, which is a good thing in general, but in here, they went too far, making the music too silent. This in turn forces replaygain in my player to switch from -6 dB to -7.12 dB because of clipping problems, which is annoying (but not technically wrong in any way). It's a minor issue all in all, but along with the clicks it mostly discourages me from adding this disc to the playlist. Not a good DVD Audio release."
5,Tribal Faithful!,"Having seen Blue Man Group live, this CD had a lot to live up to. But it captures the essence of their music: tribal, inductive rhythms that pull you into the music and alter your mind. If you can't see them, hear them."
3,Another book sized-collection of articles,"I went into this book with some high hopes. Kids! Spelling! How could you beat that? And, a quick flip through the pages said the same. The writing style is good, and the writer has lots of variety for spelling the same items. However, it all turns when you realize that you are introduced to the same children two or three times. Why, its just a collection of articles that were written about these kids, and no one even bothered to put them back together again in a cohesive manner! Because of that poor editorial decision, I don't think that this book is worth picking up, there are better spelling bee books out there."
5,Inspiring,"Seems like too often we read news stories describing how our country is going downhill. Reading this book has been a wonderful antidote. Mr. Maguire says: ""... the Bee is ... downright inspirational to watch.""He brings the kids, the event to life. It's so refreshing to read and get to know these kids. And they are just ""kids."" They are fully alive enjoying what they do. Our future is in their hands. No need to worry."
4,A sturdy well made basket,"This basket is exactly as pictured, is well made, and works well. It's a bit smaller than I had visualized. I measured to check and the dimensions shown are correct, but note that they measure from tip to tip of the handles (which flare outwards) and the actual basket is about 1 1/4"" less at the top and 11 inches at the bottom (about 3 1/2 inches less). Not a big deal, but something to note.Still it's nice enough and big enough for many things. Those who need something a little bigger may want to consider this item:Design Ideas Mesh Storage Nest, Silver, Giantwhich is taller and holds more, though it cost more as well.All in all, this item is fairly priced and a solid 4 stars."
4,Classico Basket Chrome,I bought several of these baskets for under the cabinet organization and they work great. I would buy more if they fit.
3,"Easier freezer organization, but less capacity","Maybe someone should design freezers with removable baskets, then they would fit properly and not waste space. That aside, I cleaned out my freezer and now have two of these sitting on the shelves. That makes hunting around for something much easier and nothing simply falls out when the door is opened, but the price was a slightly reduced capacity as the baskets are a couple of inches shorter than the shelves. Too small for boxed pizzas but fantastic for all those slippery bags of veg or fruit, half finished boxes and other assorted cold items. Do check your shelf measurements carefully first."
4,Where has this artist been hiding?,"This collection ranges from smooth jazz to a hard hitting beat with great lead guitar sounds. The tunes are catchy, well composed, and make you want to move a little, even if you are sitting down. Several tracks focus on today's current events as the artist attempts to awaken our senses and expose our feelings. I recommend this CD to a wide range of listeners because of the variety it offers."
3,"Easy to apply, problems sticking",I bought these for my kids room about a month ago and they were very easy to apply. What I didn't like is that I had to flatten them under heavy books for a few days because the pages of stickers are folded in thirds to fit into the package. So far only one of these stickers has fallen off my wall. I would definitely recommend them.
5,Fahrenheit's Brother,"No one will ever confuse this for a woman's perfume.It clearly isn't unisex.2 sprays max, this stuff is POTENT like Fahrenheit but even SPICIER!It smells (disgusting) like hot peppers when you first put it on.After 5 minutes the cinnamon kicks in and makes it great.After an hour, it's cinnamon and vanilla.It lasts over 24 hours, and is just vanilla at the end.Women I don't know get closer just to a get a whiff.This is for manly men only."
4,smells good,"since I used this product, a lot of people have been asking me about it. I'm glad other people like it's smell"
5,"Pheromones, Pheromones, Pheromones","This stuff smells great! Provocative glances from the opposite sex abound, unfortunately they're all my age (I will volunteer: over 50). Really, this is a good masculine cologne. A hint of tobacco, so it doesn't smell fruity. And the price is right."
4,Gift for Son,He picked it out and was happy with it. I thought it was a little pricy for the size. Again he picked it out and was happy with it.
5,Perfect,"Once again, the item is exactly as listed and the price was even better. Cannot beat shopping on Amazon for the things we want. Thank you"
3,Mature Scent,"Warning: This is a mature scent. As a college guy, I bought this because of all the rave reviews (I was desperate for a new cologne). The scent is definitely something I would never wear. I'm considering just passing it along to my father."
5,Good Music for All Ages,I would recommend this brazilian group music to any family. My daughters and grandchilds are enjoying every minute listening to it.
4,Works like a charm,"The product has worked perfectly so far. I purchased to be able to remotely zoom a side camera for my multi-camera events, and so far it's worked perfectly. The cable is thin enough to be coil tightly for portability but sturdy enough I'm not worried about it breaking.The only reason I gave it 4-stars is that because of the length, the cable can easily tangle. I'd give it 5-stars if it came with some sort of coiler/winder."
4,Fly,"An interesting book, a bit light on the details. Light hearted view of fly genetics, an easy read, certainly worth a look. Not being a carbon based lifeform, I find it a bit difficult to relate to, but interesting non the less. ;-) RR"
3,The Princes of Ireland,I found the reading slow . But will continue. I have to adjust to the characters whenever a new generation would appear.
4,A Novel of Ireland,"I have only read 27% of the book, however I do enjoy it very much. I have read several of Mr. Rutherfurd's past books and have also enjoyed them greatly. His blending of real folk like St. Patrick aids the piece well. I enjoy the morphing of places and names from ancient times to the not so distant past while becoming more famaliar. I'll finish this book quite quickly."
3,Slow Start,"I love Rutherfurd as a writer. Sarum is impressive; London is purely enjoyable; The Forest is excellent. The Princes of Ireland starts slow, and through the first three chapters, I really thought, ""Well, no one is always on."" Once this novel hits chapter four, however, it is pure Rutherfurd and very good."
2,Barely touches on actual history,"I'm not even finished reading this ""historical"" novel and I'm already disappointed. Perhaps I've read too much Irish history, but I was very frustrated with the way Rutherfurd barely touched on certain historical events in Ireland without elaborating, even a little.I would recommend Leon Uris' TRINITY and REDEMPTION and also Bodie and Brock Thoene's THE GALWAY CHRONICLES for much more satisfying historical fiction on Ireland.These series are quite informative, while also being riveting and interesting."
4,Better than Publishers Weekly suggests,"If you liked London or Sarum, then you will probably like this book as well. It is written at about their standard. As such, it is, in my opinion, better than The Forest, which to my mind is the worst of Mr. Rutherfurd's books.If you have not read Mr. Rutherfurd, the best comparison is to the later books of James Michener. As an introduction to his works, this book is less than adequate as it only represents the first half of the story. It very much ends in mid story.This will make a lovely beach book. It's nicely rambling with several generations of interesting characters set in a variety of historical settings. And as such has no pretensions to high literature. It is a good read."
2,Not worth the time spent to read,I am a huge fan of historical novels and was most interested in reading this book. I found myself speed reading through the last 100 pages just to be done with it. Some of the chapters and related characters were interesting but overall the book was a disappointment.
4,Ireland Is Getting Clearer,"For most of my adult life I have avoided any books about the French or the Irish. The perfidy of the French and the anger of the Irish has just left me cold. Now that I've read Rutherford's book (all 780 pages!), I can better understand the current conflict, and it looks to me like its the same kind of mess that exists in the Mid-east. I can see how things transpired, but I can't see how they will ever be resolved.Rutherford does an admirable job of telling the tale, an epic struggle if there ever was one. The ""family tree"" in the front of the book was of inestimable help, as were the maps.Since I'm descended from Irish roots, I have long felt that I should know more about the country. Now I do...but it will be awhile before I want to learn any more."
3,"interesting history, people, not so much","I listened to the tape of this book. The narrator was great or otherwise I don't think I would have finished it. This is a period of history I didn't know much about, so I found that aspect of the book of passing interest. However, there were many ""great romances"" and ""century old grudges"", all foretold with the same dry information as a high school history book. I'd find another source for the history."
4,Loved it!,I thought it was an amazing book! Very thorough and informative! I'm really looking forward to reading the next one and reading his other books.
4,Scott's Review,"I have been a fan of Edward Rutherford for many years and have read all of his books. I really was impressed with how well he captured the ancient history of Ireland and the spirit of the Irish people. His description of the places took me back to my visits to these sites (New Grange, Tara, Dublin, Waterford, Wexford,etc.), and brought back very fond memories of this great country."
4,The beginning was the best,"when he started in on the politics of Ireland and England it was hard to keep up. At times he put in things that just didn't seem to fit-almost like he added it just to make the book longer. At first I thought it was in there because of historical significance, but then in his epiloge he says he made it up...I think the book should have been shortened and some extraneous material edited out. The beginning was very interesting and I especially was compassionate towards several of the characters he portrayed. Problem was that I would just get into the character and the storyline, and then he would end it, or switch off. Not one of his best reads, but it was enjoyable through most of it so I gave it four stars."
2,No Pot of Gold,"Princes of Ireland: The Dublin Saga is a disappointing, meandering and disjointed attempt to tell the story of Ireland, Dublin and its princes. But the storytelling goes all over Ireland only occasionally returning to Dublin and ""Princes"" is not the word I would have used for most of the mundane, ignoble characters portrayed.There are in all fairness some fine moments in the tale and there is a slight touch of magic ever so slightly glimpsed within the pages. But there is no pot of gold at the end of this tome, not-tat-tall."
2,Better Than A Sleeping Pill,"I've read Sarum, London, & The Forest and really enjoyed them. This book is not nearly as good. It's just plain boring. I kept reading with the hope that the book would improve in the next chapter - needless to say my hopes were dashed! I will probably give his next book a chance, after all, every author should be allowed a ""dud"" now and then."
5,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Journey Through Irish History,"A sweeping tale that covers a thousand years of Irish history through the lives of many generations of several fictional families living in the Dublin area. It is a fascinating and engrossing book written in a style that reminds you of the books of James Mitchner. This is a book for anyone interested in the history of Ireland but wants a more personal understanding of how the times affected the people living them. And the beauty is that this is just half the story. ""The Rebels of Ireland"" picks up where this leaves off and takes the reader up to the twentieth century. Both are must reads."
4,Well-researched historical fiction,"Although I have been aware of Rutherfurd for quite some time, this is the first of his works that I have read. I found the book to be, overall, quite interesting but perhaps somewhat awkward at times in the transitioning elements. Some of the more interesting chapters are those describing pagan Ireland, the Viking influences, and, of course, the conflict with the English. The last 75 pages or so I found to be especially captivating, but the ending was somewhat anticlimatic. A possible explanation for this is that Rutherford wants to leave us hungry for more as ""The Princes of Ireland"" has a planned sequel, ""The Rebels of Ireland,"" which has now been published. Based on my experience with ""The Princes of Ireland,"" I would definitely take on another of Rutherfurd's books."
3,"OK read, needed a firmer editor.","This being my first read of Edward Rutherford, I have found the book (3/4 read)to be not bad...but could have used some better editing to smooth the transitions from one time period to the other. Some bits, like the English and land and title etc. could have been tightened up and made less boring. I would have liked it if he had spent more time with the Vikings. On the whole the first part of the book is more interesting than the rest."
5,Loved This!,"I absolutely loved this as well The Rebels of Ireland, which is the same book as Awakening:Ireland. I could hardly put them down. I love his style & I like generational sagas. I found the history complicated & fascinating woven into stories of characters I cared about. I thought both were excellent!!!"
3,historical,I found it a little hard to stay interested in reading.I lost interest in the book many times and am struggling to finish it.
5,The Princes of Ireland--An outstanding historical novel,"Edward Rutherfurd's writing reminds me of a newer James Mitchner--except I think Rutherfurd is a better writer. In each of his books, he takes three or four families and traces them over hundreds of year. Princes of Ireland begins just after the Romans leave Ireland and covers up to just after the Norman invasion of England. It (like all his books) is well researched and historically accurate. It is an epic that will please anyone interested in historical fiction."
4,I loved this book!,"I found it to be a wonderful read! Epic saga, facinating historical descriptions, characters of interest. True, one does not feel passionately connected to any charcter in particular, but rather, there is a true feel for the flow of time through generations of people within a geographical area, and the development of a nation and unique culture. The connection the reader makes is to a culture and a time, rather than to individual characters. It's a bit like the feeling one had as a child when your parents told you stories of your ancestors. The description of the ""selling"" of Christainity to the Pagans makes me understand for the first time what I was taught about God ""sacrificing his only son for you"". This is the first and only Rutherfurd novel I have read. I can only say I must read more."
2,Lackluster indeed,I had trouble finishing this rather boring history of Ireland. The characters are two dimensional and the whole story lacks connectedness. It was more fits and starts and then a change to a totally different time. It seemed the author was unsure if he was writing a novel or history and tried to cover too much ground at one time.
1,"Boring, Boring...and did I say Boring?","In a nut shell, one of the most boring, poorly written books I've read in a long time. Put it down after 200 pages...I love Celtic history but there needs to be an interesting story line to move it along....didn't find it here!"
2,"2 stars, and being generous","I was not a big fan of the style of this book. 150 pages of characters and storylines, then skip ahead a few hundred years and start all over with new characters with new storylines. It was kind of confusing when trying to figure out how all the characters were related.But at least for the first few hundred pages we were reading about battles and big events in the history of Ireland. The last few hundred pages were about trivial events that were only important to the characters in the story. It became more like reading a non-fiction history book. This book is rare in that it became more boring as the story went on, instead of leading towards a climactic end. I couldn't wait for it to be done."
2,A Dull Saga,"And I had such high hopes!! This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I merely skimmed the last half, reading it for the history it touched upon. I loved Rutherfurd's London, liked The Forest, but dreaded picking up this book day after day. I knew nothing of this period in time, and that's what kept me going. For those interested in historical fiction pertaining to Ireland, read Thomas Flanagan's trilogy. Morgan Llewelyn's 20th C trilogy is also pretty good--not great, but good."
4,Top quality historical fiction,"Rutherfurd is a modern day Michener, and if historical fiction is your cup of tea, Rutherfurd is a worthy successor. I first read his novel, Russka, and have subsequently read all his works (Sarum, London and Prices of Ireland). Of these, Russka is still my favorite. I don't put Rutherfurd in quite the same league as Michener and Clavell, but I'd be hard pressed to find anyone better at this genre at this point in time."
2,"Well, they can't all be winners!","First, I've really enjoyed Edward Rutherford's earlier works: Sarum, London and The Forest. Unfortunately, I found his new book, Princes of Ireland, to be very disappointing. The characters seemed thin and failed to make me truly care about them as in his other books. In previous books, I eagerly looked forward to seeing the connections between generations. Seeing the differences and the similarites that really made it personal as far as demostrating the changing times. Maybe it was that in this book there was no real engaging architectural/structural focal point ie: the Tower or a cathedral to focus on. And for such a lyrical, passionate people such as the Irish, the book was very flat, hanging the plot it seemed more on politics than people. They can't all be winners! Maybe the next book...."
4,Not his best but good,"I confess to being a little disappointed. Something is missing but I can't define it. Maybe a lack of interest in the characters and their fate.""London"" and ""Sarum"" are heart-stopping. I got the feeling he tossed this one off a little too quickly.Still, I am a devout fan."
5,History made enoyable,"My first Rutherfurd novel and I look forward to others.Definitey in the style of Michener,a good thing, in which characters/families are followed throughout a period of history in certain locales-this one Dublin.This was one of those stories I did not want to end and fortunately it continues with Rebels of Ireland.I am looking forward to reading that one and some of Rutherfurd's others."
3,I'm not quite sure what the problem is,"This is probably all my fault, these historical epic books all tend to run together (at least from my prespective) after awhileI loved parts of this story particularly dealing with the adventures of Fergus son of Fergus at the ford in this respect the book does what it claimed it would do, painted an interesting story of Ireland and particularly Dublin in the time period in which it is set. Eventually as the book continues things start to go wrong.Its not that the book is boring its just the exposition of characters takes such a long time this trend continues without fail in any time period explored in the book. This makes for an extremely choppy narration and takes away from a story that could have been really great. I really don't know if the problem is too much space and not enough story or the other way around.Overall-Needs an editor that's for sure, if they had cut out 200 pages somewhere and ironed out the dialog a little the story would have been fine."
1,what a let down,"I am an adamant lover of choral music. When i discovered this CD, I was ecstatic to find these masterworks recorded. It was to my utter disappointment to realize the quality of the choir on this CD. There seems to be no choral concept of proper breath support to sustain and truly evoke the beauty of the text. Pitch problems and the wobbly vibrato become tiresome after a few listens and there also exists a lack of phrasing. These elements are things you would expect to be mastered on any recording from any ensemble, even on the novice level. Only thing is that here, it is all missing. I know I may sound harsh, but when you list American church composers, Sowerby is at the top with very few others. It is only fitting that someone records his music well, it is the least that they can do. In this case, I'm not sure what happened."
2,very tight,"Bought these to fit cd's and cd booklets, one on each side. They barely fit the cd's alone and forget about the booklets!"
1,Much Too Tight for CD/DVDs,"I won't even use these if the CD or DVD is going to be used by my husband or anyone else with little patience. This is such a tight fit you are going to get finger prints all over your CD while trying to get it in and out of this sleeve. Someone with especially little patience might even break the CD while trying to force it in. Also, it is double sided so when you put the second CD in the other side that side of the sleeve crinkles up. It seems well enough made so I would have given it four stars if the CDs fit in more easily. I don't feel like returning this so I'll just use it as a single sleeve for CDs only I listen to occasionally."
2,They're okay but most of them are not even specially if you put two CD,They're okay but a lot of them are not perfectly even when you put the CD in. There is no way you can put CDs on each side because the plastic would go up/down. Next time I'll try another brand.
5,"Fits well, sturdy, can see what is in the sleeve","These sleeves are exactly what I was looking for1) They are plastic rather paper, so you can see through them. The plastic is slightly smoky in color2) They are double sided (i.e. each sleeve can take two cds)3) The divider between the two sides is slightly fuzzy material, so it is non-slip4) They fit CDs well (not too snug, so CDs are easy to take out)5) Good sturdy qualityI recommend this product!"
4,Note these actual dimensions,"I like these sleeves and I ordered them along with the Ideastream CD storage boxes. But the actual dimensions of the sleeves are 5.75""H X 5""W (including the title tab at the top). The Ideastream boxes are 5""H with the lid. This means that if the CD box is full, the titles have to be folded back in order for the lid to fit securely. Other than that minor nuisance, the system works well and saves lots of space."
4,Fellow's cd sleeves,These are very nice sleeves. I have bought sleeves from other companies but these outdid them all. Excellent product
4,Well made....for a specific storage need.,These were different than what I had read about or expected.I found that removing the discs a bit awkward...requiring that fingers touch the recorded surface....if not careful. Some people might find it a bit difficult.Ideal for minimum storage space...etc.
5,An Onslaught of Brilliance,"I can not believe I found Aztlan Nation on Amazon. This group made me who I am today. From the wicked mad rhymes of Chapo Zul to the dope lyrics of ""Wet Back,"" this group pioneered rap for all latinos!"
1,Fun if you like hateful racism,"If you've ever wanted to hear what the Latino equivalent of the Aryan Brotherhood or the Nation of Islam would sound like, than this piece of audio excrement is for you. These guys do nothing to set a good example to the people of their community,instead they revel in gang life and knee jerk racism and cling to incredibly stupid radical beliefs. Aztlan is a fairy tale that never even existed anyways."
2,One of the stones fell out and I've only had it for a week,"I loved this ring. I bought and received another one as well as earrings from this vendor at the same time. Much to my surprise and disappointment, one of the stones fell out today. I don't want to go to the trouble to return it so I glued it back ... I hope I don't lose anymore stones. :-("
1,One Creepy Children's Book,"I can't figure out why so many people love this book. I think it is great to install the idea that a parent's love is unconditional and forever but there a million other books that convey this message without being creepy. Let me put it this way. If my mother-in-law broke into our house in the middle of the night and tried to rock my husband to sleep, I would do one of two things. I would get her to the doctor to check for senile dementia or I would get a restraining order against her. Luckily, my mother-in-law is a lovely lady who would never do that. I also feel that it gives the message that you are not OK with your child growing up and becoming their own person. There is a Norman Bates quality to the whole thing. Skip this book and get ""Guess How Much I Love You."" It has the same theme without the weirdness."
5,Still touching!,"I had forgotten all about this book until I happened to spot it at the elementary school that I work at. I had a few minutes to spare, and decided to quickly thumb through the book for old time's sake. At almost 20 years old, by the time I finished this book, my eyes were filled with tears and I had a lump in my throat the size of a golf ball. This is one of the best children's books ever published. As soon as I finish writing this review, I'm going to order it and have it sent to my 2 year old niece :)Anyone who thinks that this book is creepy needs to get over themself. The touching part isn't the LITERAL rocking a grown man to sleep. It's the CONCEPT of loving your child no matter how old they are, no matter how annoying they can be, no matter where they live. If you're not smart enough to figure out the main concept of a children's book, maybe you shouldn't be passing your less-than-average-intelligence genes on..."
1,Creepy with a capital C,I can appreciate the message that this book is going for but the fact that it is so disturbing overshadows that by far. Not one of our favorites.
1,"Sweet intentions, don't agree with how it unfolds","We received this book as a baby shower gift for our son, who is now 6. I distinctly remember sitting down to read this book to him when he was just an infant. It is sweet to staart, but as I went along through both son and mother getting older, I could see where it was headed...and it wasn't somewhere I wanted to go. It was creepy enough when the mom picks up the teenage son at night, but when she puts a ladder on top of her car and drives across town to crawl in his window to ""hold"" him? Too much! And I get that it's a fact of life that mothers die at some point, but I really don't want that as part of a book for my infant/toddler child. I know others see this as a ""must-have"" book, but I'd say it's a ""must stay away"" book instead."
3,Good & Bad,"The first time I read this book I was balling by the end. However, the first time my husband read it, he was appalled. Once he shared his 'dark' view of the odd relationship being portrayed, I can't help but think of it upon repeat readings. However, if he had never shared his view, I would think of this as very poignant reading portraying a very positive mother/son relationship."
1,Disgusting,"I had to put this book away halfway through. It was just a disgusting piece of bad fiction.The story starts off nicely, and the song the mother sings her son is cute, but then it gets real creepy.Do people realise there are horror movies about this topic? Misery? Psycho? Would you show your children these movies, to show them how to show their love to people?Really. This is a sick, sick story disguised as a charming and endearing children's tale.Let me tell you - it's not."
5,Very moving!,"I do not have any children, but I love this book. I have purchased it for all my friends with children, as well as my boyfriend's mother. This a wonderful story about the cycles of life and I highly recommend it to anyone at all. I cry EVERY time I read it."
4,An exquisitely touching tale.,"Robert Munsch outdid himself with this tale of a mothers love for her child. I came across this book myself when I was a teenage babysitter. Now, as an adult and a mother to four beautiful adopted children, my family has come to treasure the story of a child going through the stages of life and a mother who loves him unconditionally. If you hear anything negative about this book, I encourage you to get a copy and see for yourself. I would almost guarantee that you will become entranced and near tears when you read the words ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as you're living, my baby you'll be."" In a small book, we learn the lengths that a mother goes to and what she endures for her children...and that no matter what..and above all else, she loves them just the same."
1,A disturbing book,"I was fine until I found the mother crawling across the floor of her son's room at night. And when she began driving across town to climb into his window at night, I wondered if I was the only one who found this a rather unhealthy image. I think you can teach unconditional love without the undertones of ownership and dysfunctional attachments. I think most people just pretend the mother crawling across the floor section doesn't exist---however, I couldn't ignore it, so I won't be buying this book for any child."
1,Creepy and overly sentimental,"The book starts out sweet, but becomes very odd as the characters age. It has a geriatric mother climbing in the window of her adult son to rock him to sleep. The first time I read this book to my daughter I cried at the manipulative ending. This frightend my daughter so much that she never wanted to hear the book again. It's too weird and too sentimental. I accidentally picked up a halloween book by the same author that also had a very bizarre plot. I think he's a little off."
1,Demented,"I totally agree with the librarian who wrote about this book being a horror story. I think people are too caught up with the theme of a story of ""tables turned"" which is ""as a young child is taken care of BY his/her parent, so must the parent eventually be taken care OF."" However, an old ""granny"" as depicted in this book, is able to climb a ladder nightly to cradle her adult son - come one! get real here! In addition, the illustrations are totally out of proportion and give a sense of oddity to the whole story. One final warning, be careful who you give this book to. I gave it as a gift to my aging mother, who thought it was a nightmare! She didn't cry out of sentiment, but took offense and thought I was ready to spoon feed her and carry her up to her death bed!"
5,Special Story,This is a very special story of a Mother's love for her children and how in the end that love is returned. I cry every time I read this book to my children. My children like the story and I have heard them singing the song spontaneously throughout the day. I think it moves them in their understanding of love and relationships. A very special book to have in your library and to read often with your children.
4,need to be a parent to appreciate it,"Love you forever is a good book but you have to be a mother or father with children of your own to really appreciate it. Since I am not married and do not haved children it's not one of my favorite reads. Most parents who I know, however, love it and start crying while they are in the process of reading the book. I highly suggest buying it if you are or are soon to be a parent or you know someone who is. If you aren't a parent then you need to read the book first and judge for yourself."
5,Excellent family reading...love from cradle to end of life,My family gathers around and reads/sings this book together. This mothers love begins for her tiny baby...and his love for her carries through as she grows old. The transition from loving parent to loved parent is touching. I hope that my children see this modeled in our home and care for us as diligently as this man cares for his aging mother.
5,You folks who think this book is creepy are WEIRD,"Incest? Stalking? are you kidding me??? Stop watching so much ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit""! This story is as sweet as can be. It saddens me that some people think being affectionate with your child is ""creepy""."
1,Very Creepy,"I bought this book after reading the reviews and wow, this is very creepy. Complete with stalking.... What was the author thinking? How can anyone enjoy this?"
1,This book freaked me out!,"I bought this book after I gave birth to my first child, a son. The cover and the title of the book caught my eye. When I brought it home and read it, I immediately got a creeped out feeling. First I thought that it was going to be funny because the mother was still rocking her teenage son. Then I realized that it wasn't going in a funny direction. When I saw the adult son rocking his mother in a rocking chair, after finding out she was sick, it made me sad and freaked me out.I am not sure how this book won so many awards. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
1,I thought I was the only one who hated this book,"When my in-laws gave this book to my son as a Christmas gift, I put it on his shelf not thinking anything. But then I read it. What a horrible book. All I could think about is that it would scar him for life with a fear that his parents were going to die. Shortly thereafter, I put it in the garbage. I cannot imagine why anyone would give this book to any child. There must be a million better ways to express how much parents love their children. I thought that I was the only one who felt this way and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. Fortunately, I see that I am not alone in my distaste for this terrible story. Thank goodness that there are others who have some common sense."
1,Ugh. This Book Is Seriously Unhealthy.,"Do you want your mother to ""love you forever"" so much that even when you're grown-up and living in your own home, she drives over in the middle of the night and climbs through your window and rocks you like a baby? Because that's what happens in this weird & creepy book. You want to be stalked by your mother into old age? This book is seriously unhealthy. Ick. When I worked at a children's bookstore, we used to hide it from customers and put other alternatives in their hands. Plus, the illustrations are so flat out ugly. This is not about how much parents love their children (which involves letting them grow up), this is about not being able to let go. I think Munsch needs therapy."
1,Profoundly Disturbing,"I received this book as a gift at my baby shower earlier this year. I cracked it open for the first time to read to my 6 mo. old son tonight and I am very grateful that he is still to young to understand what was going on. This book is profoundly disturbing, featuring a disgustingly codependent mother who engages in some extremely creepy behavior. The only thing I find more perplexing and disquieting than this book is the apparent love that so many people have for it. If anything, this book has shown me how NOT to behave as a parent. I can certainly love my child forever without climbing in through his bedroom window when he's an adult!I love books and have never thrown one away. If I don't like one, I donate it or give it to someone who might enjoy it.This is the first book I've ever put straight into the trash."
5,I Still Remember It...,"My mother bought me this book when I was young, and used to read it to me all the time. It was one of the first books I was able to read on my own. When I went to college, we started fighting more. For Christmas, I bought her this book to show her I'll always love her, no matter how I act. She loved it."
2,"We did not like this book, disappointed!","I get what the author is trying to show in this book (unconditional love that you have for your child is endless and no matter how old they are) but I did find it a bit odd that when the child is around nine and then a teenager and then he is a man and moves out and the mom still goes to his house, physically picks him up when he is sleeping and sings that lullaby. Then when she is too old the man holds the mom and sings the lullaby. In my own opinion, I believe that the author went to an extreme to show a mom's love for her child. I have to say I feel it was a little creepy too. My children ages 4 and 2 don't really seem impressed with the book at all. They do not request it at bedtime or any other time for that matter. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Super Creepy,This book is super creepy and weird. The mother sneaks into her adult son's bead and cradles him in her arms? Yeah that is bizarre. Then she dies. What a wonderful children's book. I won't be reading this to my son again.
1,We call this the Creepy Mommy Book,"We were given this book as a gift and find it disturbing. It came in a cardboard box/sleeve, which our son loved, so we sometimes read it to him, but we always added a lot of commentary. The mom in this book is creepy! She drives across town with a ladder strapped to her car roof to invade her son's privacy. This is just wrong and crazy! I'd give it zero stars if that were an option."
1,"Creepy, depressing and why read this to a child?",My dear friend gave me this book with loving intent and said that she had loved it when her children were little. I read it and was somewhat horrified. I have young toddler and lost my mom a few years ago. Why in the world would I want to burden a small child with thoughts of having to comfort her dying mother.I haven't thrown the book in the trash because my friend gave it to me...but my instincts tell me I should.I am amazed that others like the book and wonder how they find it suitable for youngsters.
4,Love You Forever,"This book was a favorite read of my daughter to her children a number of years ago...........I was pleased to see it on Amazon books even thought I wasn't looking for it!! It did not arrive in time for Christmas, but did arrive in great condition and wasso appreciated. Thank you !"
2,Book wonderful format not,"the story is great, but the paperback is cheap like something you might print off your home computer. I guess for the price is okay but not what I expected."
5,For mothers of sons . . .,"Mothers of daughters say, ""It's nice."" Mothers of sons are sobbing at the end! A very, very touching book. I highly recommend it."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"I could not endorse a book more ....it is a true love story of mom to her child which inevitably carries on to her now adult child to his little one. LOVE YOU FOREVER is a VERY HEARTFELT BOOK written with such emotion that it brings one to tears,it does me every time i read it. I read it to my son,who is now a father himself ,who reads it to his infant child.It is a book that carries on through generations ,a TRUE LOVE STORY !!! EVERY PARENT Should have a copy of it !!!"
4,Love You Forever Review,"This book had a lot of meaning in that it showed that the relationship between a mother and her son could go a long way. It proved to me that many times a son or daughter may not appear to be affectionate but still listen when they do not appear to be. As we found out, the son knew the words to the song and used them with his newly born daughter. Love You Forever it a heart riviting, warm story that a mother and father could share with their children."
2,Far Too Depressing for a Child,"While this book has a ""sweet"" premise of the circle of life, I think it is a book for an adult written as if it were a children's book. I was balling by the end of it. It is very depressing to see the man rock his dying mother. Our son was given this book as a gift and I will not keep it in his library. I think that if I actually read it to him, it would make him depressed and would conjure up ideas of his parents mortality long before he needs to think about that. I especially would not read this to a child before bed."
1,Made me cry cuz it frightened me so!,"My friend gave me this book when my daughter was born. She said she cried every time she read it to her girls. I anxiously sat down and read it that night. I was stunned at how much I abhorred this book. A mother crawling into her son's room, climbing into his window when he's an adult... too much! It gives me the creeps just thinking about the story and the picture of him cradling her in his arms in the end. Creepy, creepy, creepy."
2,I agree - this book is creepy,"I bought this for my cousin's newborn by glancing at the top books - bought this, along with good night moon, where the wild things are, etc. I had never heard of this book, whereas the others I remember from my own childhood. Well, when I thumbed through this one, I thought the ending was super creepy. Why would the mom sneak back into her son's house, and I didn't expect to see in a book the son cradling an elderly mother. Surely a book that will lead to some psychotherapy in later life! I get the sentiment, but I suggest you look at the last few pages before you buy it."
1,worst children's book ever,"I have lots and lots of childrens books but this one is by far the worst. Its a good concept, but the illustration and story of the concept that parents too get old and need care is horrendous. How about easing the little ones into the reality of life?"
5,Mother's Day Story,"This story was read to the children of our church during their time with the pastor on Mother's Day. He has read the same story every year since the book was published. It reduced the congregation to tears and no mother had a dry eye. It is one of the most beautifully powerful, yet simple, stories I have heard since The Giving Tree. It is purely about unconditional love. Nothing more."
5,A Mother's Love,"This story is a wonderful example of a mother's love for her children. Watching a child grow up and mature into an adult only deepens the love a mother feels. Ask almost any mother of any grown man and she will tell you that, that grown man is still her baby. There is a bond between mothers and their children that can't be broken. This book deals with that. There is also a bond fathers have with their children, and in the end when the tradition goes on and is passed on to his own daughter, the circle grows.As a parent, I choke up reading this book to my toddler. What's more this is one book I want him to appreciate through out the years and share with his own children someday.There is a bit of silliness in the fact that she still rocks her grown son, but it is still a children's book and I think it's appealing to their sense of humor at that point. The overall theme and emotions are A+."
1,"Actually, This Book is Rather Creepy","Something just seems rather disturbing about a woman who continually crawls into bed with her son throughout his childhood, to the point where she drives with a ladder to his house, when he's an adult, to stare at him while he's sleeping. Some people treat this book like it's the best kids book of all time, but there's just something bizarre about it. I think you can send the message that you'll love your kids forever, no matter what, without sneaking in to their bedroom as adults and watching them sleep. Creepy! I have 2 kids, and they both yawn with this book, too.Aside from the cryptic message of this tale, it's rather poorly written as well. The song repeated through the book doesn't even flow well or rhyme."
2,Ehhhhh,"I didn't love this book. I find it a little odd, the mother carrying around a grown man??? Maybe after a few readings I'll like it better but the overall theme of the book was a little much for me."
1,did not like!,"I can't quite explain why I really, really don't like this book but I was NOT impressed."
5,This is my favorite childrens book!,An absolutely beautiful story of a parents unconditional and undying love for a child. I bought this book for my son and his wife to read to their new son. I've never been able to make it through this book without crying.
4,DON'T READ THIS TO YOUR KIDS,I read this book when I was like 8 years old. I'm 23 now and still remember the whole thing because it ripped open my heart and shit in the ventricles. Don't read this to your children! It's tragic and traumatizing as hell. Look at the other reviews! They all mention how sad the book is and how it will undoubtedly make you cry. WHAT KIND OF CHILDREN'S BOOK IS THAT. Read this on your own if you're curious or masochistic but do your kids a favor and read them a story that's cute or funny instead and won't leave them lying in bed at night weeping at the thought of their mother aging and dying.
5,excellent for children and parents alike,"I first heard this book used in our children's church. It kept a large group of children, ages four to ten, focused on the story and the pictures. Many of the adults in the church that day were similarily attentive. Excellent story. It left all with a timeless lesson. I have now sent to my sons to read to their children."
1,"Very, Very Creepy","I didn't read the reviews, and thought this book (since it's always so highly recommended)involved a mother simply rocking her baby to sleep, then singing the song to him as he got older. Instead she is sneaking into his room, then into his house (through a window) to continue to rock him- I found the book disturbing and not something I wanted to read to my daughter-- I don't think it is ok to sneak into your adult child's room, let alone break into their house, and don't find anything endearing or sweet about those actions. The song was cute, I wish the storyline was less disturbing."
2,Weird and Creepy,"I liked the story up until the part where the mother goes across town, climbs through her adult son's bedroom window, and rocks him while singing. Then we have the next section of the story where the son has to rock her because she is too old, frail and possibly dying. Who wants to read something like that to their child as a bedtime story?My husband thinks it's a sweet book. I think it's strange. Therefore it is not allowed to be read in this house again.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,NOT for the picture book set!,"I reviewed and purchased children's books in a professional capacity for many years, and was actually shocked when I read this book. Other reviewers have mentioned the mother crawling in her grown-up son's bedroom window at night. Shudder. And yes! to the psychologist who mentioned this book models very poor relationships. It is also maudlin and sentimental, which could be forgiven. (In the biz we used to call guilty pleasures ""a good read"".) But I'm quite sure that many if not most children would find this frightening. I found it disturbing. But that's okay: I'm not 3 and likely to be scarred for life!"
2,Not such a fan...,Hmmm...after hearing so much buzz about this book I purchased it for our home library. After reading it once it promptly found itself back on the shelf...I was not such a fan. It has a very sweet and tender message but I could not get past some of the subject matter. It was not exactly appropriate bedtime reading for my 3.5 year olds. I did a full review of this book on my website [...]. Feel free to check it out and leave some feedback.
5,A must for every son,"My mother gave me this book for my 16th birthday, also 2 months before she was diagnosed with cancer and 4 months before she passed away. It is one of my most dear personal belongings. I'm currently buying 5 copies for my sister and sister-in-law to give to my 5 nephews. If you're a mother with a son, I recommend you do the same."
1,Creepy!,"Even though it's come to my attention that the author meant this as a joke, I still couldn't help but get the creeps reading this. His 80 year old mother climbs into his bedroom and rocks her 40 year old son to sleep was...well...disturbing. I'm in the minority on this one, however. Most people find the book touching and tear-jerking so I'll just stop right here."
4,It's all in the perspective!,"This is a beautiful story of a mother's love for her child and her child's love for her. The idea that is to be grasped, toward the end of the book, is that the memories the mother has of taking care of and loving her son are still with her and that to the very end she loves him enough to still ""rock him"". She doesn't actually go climb the ladder and rock him! I understand that thought completely. I will always have an open spot on my lap and in my arms for my child - but I fully recognize that doesn't mean she's always going to want to take advantage of it! While this book is a tear-jerker, my daughter has no problem understanding the concepts. Perhaps a 5 year old is better equipped to understand unconditional love than adults; after all a 5 year old is more inclined to show unconditional love while the majority of adults have far too many ""expectations"" of those they love.We love this book and all my friends and their kids do as well!"
1,SCARY!,"We recieved this as a gift for my daughter. At first, I thought it was a sweet story. That was until I got to the end of the book and the mother is going across town to break into her grown son's home to hug him while he sleeps. What was this author thinking?"
1,Kids book or screenplay for a really sick slasher movie,"I read this story and thought it was some sick joke. What kind of parent stalks their kid through out life? You seriously could make this into a really creepy psycho thriller. Read this book to your kid and (s)he'll learn to throw your watch in the toilet, you may sell him to the zoo, pull food out of a refrigerator, say bad words --Oh yeah there's also an image of a kid playing in a toilet. Read that to a three-year-old and see what (s)he'll pick up.Now the premise is touching --your parent will love you forever. Now hopefully that love will not cross boundaries that include breaking and entering and stalking.I seriously am surprised by the positive attention given to this book."
2,"If you don't think this book is strange, I feel for your children.","My parents got this book for us when we had our first child. Honestly, the first half isn't all that bad, but when the son becomes a teenager, it begins to get a little strange. Understand this, my son is three, and I hold him and tell him I love him at least once a day. However, do I plan to drive across town when he has his own house, climb into his window, and hold him while he's sleeping? NO! What in the world!Obviously there are lots of opposing views for this book, but I would encourage anyone considering this book, to find a store and read it in its entirety before purchasing.If possible, I personally would have given the first half of the book 3 stars, and the second half 0 stars. Unfortunately it's not possible, and being that it's not the worst book I've ever read, I settled for two stars."
1,Bizarro bedtime reading,"This book is equal parts maudlin and creepy. Neither of those characteristics bode well for a children's bedtime story. I suppose that for young children who don't really understand it, and only really want to be held and hear a parent's voice, the quality of the book itself doesn't matter. But in which case, you still don't need to buy this book. Pick up something nice by Shel Silverstein, Margaret Wise Brown, Eric Carle or Sandra Boynton instead."
3,"Nice book, like to read it at storytime but...","As a mother I really like this book. I have even started saying the chant to my son at night. However, I do think it is a little creepy that the mother sneaks into her sons house. I understand the love and the bond but, I just don't like the sneakiness. Good book, nice warm touchy feely, and I do read it to my son."
5,Great Book!!,"I loved this book, my kids loved this book and my husband even liked this book. I cried when I read it the first couple of times, my husband cried too when he read it the first time. Very wonderful book about a parents love for her child. I would recommend this book to any one wanting a good book to read to their child at bedtime or any time of the day."
4,Love you forever,"Love you foreveris an awesome book. It talks about a mother who watchs her son grow up and move out. It has a life long journey of how a mother sees her son become a man and have his own family. It has an enjoyment for the whole family. I liked this book because it is a funny story but has a morale too. I would recommend this book to parents who have newborn children. If you compare this story to another childrens book, it would get the best rated. This book brings a warm felling to all who read it."
5,A touching story,I loved this story. It is about the unconditional love that a mother has for her son as he grows from a baby into a man. I found it to be very touching and I would recommend it to others.
5,A memory to share,"When I was young my mom read this to me and from then on when we got mad at each other, she would say ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be"". It is a memory I will forever treasure. When my sister-in-law announced her pregnancy, I sent it as a gift. Now she reads it to my baby nephew all the time and they are creating their own bonding memory. Such a special book! Please share this with your loved one!!!"
5,Must Read,"Love You Forever was a staple in our household, and gifted to maybe hundreds of our friends who had children. My daughter now reads it aloud, just as I read it to her. If you are a parent, try getting through the last few pages without choking up just a little. During sleepovers, kids would laugh during that part because they knew the tears were coming. Now those same kids are feeling the same thing. A wonderful book and a must read.Rayna Gangi, author, ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause."""
5,excellent/touching,"i heard someone read thi book at church one day, and i thought to myself, that is a book that i would love to own. it laid a a drawer for years, then one day i decided that i would send it to my oldest son for his birthday. then i have another son so i orderd him this book for his birthday, also. i ordered this book from amazon"
5,To my children,I love this book. I've read it to all my kids. This is a book I could read over and over again
5,One of my favorites,"My whole family loves this book. I thought it was sort of odd at first, but once you've read it with a child a couple of times you'll be hooked.It's a simple book, but the theme of ""I'm your parent, and I'm with you through it all"" is well done, and can be very comforting when you read it to your child. The illustrations aren't intended to be overly humorous (I think), but my son and I laugh every time we see the little old lady rocking the full-grown son.We used this book extensively with our oldest child after the second child was born. It can be a great aid in getting over the rough spots (jealousy, competition, sibling rivalry etc) and reinforcing your bond with your first-born."
3,Bought for my nephew,"The book was a good price, and I know it was used, just didn't expect all of the writing I found on the inside cover and first page. Be super careful when clicking on the used price."
1,this is a sick book,"As mentioned in the review, the mother sings a song ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be."" When the child in the story is young, this is very appropriate. But when the child grows into manhood, the mother goes to his house at night. When she sees that all the lights are off, she uses a ladder to climb into his window, cuddle him and sing the song. This is sick! I'm not sure what this book is trying to promote, but I doubt that stalking, breaking and entering is something we want children to learn. In addition, rocking the grown man while saying ""As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be"" is a little warped.I think the story is tender when it comes to singing to an infant and a child. But, climbing into the grown man's window just turned me off. I could NOT like the story from that point on. In fact, I couldn't even give this book away, I needed to throw it away so no child will see this."
1,Ever heard of THE YELLOW WALLPAPER?,"I'm a collector of children's books and it's pretty hard to disappoint me in this genre. But whoa, did LOVE YOU FOREVER disappoint and totally freak me out. The mother in the story must not have any family or friends that realize she needs a mental evaluation. It reminds me of the character in The Yellow Wallpaper, who loses her mind at night in a mentally ill state. Also, the illustrations are dreary and depressing, as if to help the sick little story along.LOVE YOU FOREVER gives me an uneasy feeling and a children's book should not do that. If you want to read a beautiful children's book about loving your child try 'I Love You As Much...' by Laura Krauss Melmed."
3,I have very mixed feelings about the book,"My sister gave this book to my daughter, who's still too young to request it, so I haven't been forced to read it over and over yet; in fact, after reading it to her a couple of times, I decided it would be one of the few books I let her chew on. Yes, it has a wonderful message about unconditional love, but I do find the part about the mother crawling on the floor to her son's bed to rock him very off-putting. Note I'm not claiming it's ""sick,"" I just have a visceral reaction to it and think it's a little too weird. So maybe after the book's slowly dissolved into small pieces (my daughter's a good chewer) I'll sing her the song and forget about the rest."
2,Not for me. . .,"This book wasn't for me. . .depressed me actually. At the start of my child's life, I couldn't deal with a book that was about me growing old and leaving him behind. I know that not the book's point and perhaps I'll wake up in a another year and love it but for now I've put it away and don't plan to pick it up again anytime soon."
3,College student,"This story was about a mother that rocks and sings to her son during his life span. The mom would sing, ""I'll love you forever/ I'll like you for always/ As long as I'm living/ my baby you'll be."" The mom would crawl across the floor and look at her son at night. If she found him asleep, she would rock him and sing to him. She grew old. In the end, the son held the mom to sing and rock her.I found this story strange and yet emotional. I felt it was strange for a mom to pick up a grown man while sleeping. It is humanly impossible. I also thought it was strange for a mom to take a ladder to her son's house to crawl through a window to rock and sing to him. I felt emotional when the son held his old mom and sang to her."
1,Creepy,Wow...Someone actually green-lighted this book. Don't stop reading til you get to the part where the kid is rocking his elderly mum.
4,A heartfelt bedtime story,"Love You Forever is a bedtime story that any child will enjoy. It follows a very loving and caring mother who sneaks into her sons room first as a infant, as a toddler, nine years old, as a teenager, and although he no longer lives in the same house as a grown man. When she comes into the room at night she rocks him back and forth and sings; ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be. She does this until she becomes an old woman, and her son returns the message to her, as well as his very own newborn daughter. Every picture shows the story line, and a child will soon catch the obvious animal that lurks on each page. This story is bound to bring togetherness for the family at bedtime."
3,Adults Love This Book,"Adults seem to love this book, it's very sentimental, but there are better children's books out there. I would recommend this more for adults: adult children moving out on their own, new parents, or maybe new grandparents. There is little in this story about a mother watching her son grow up, move out and start a family of his own that a child can relate to. In the end the son, who is now a father, says goodbye to his mother and takes on the role of the caring parent for his own child."
1,a little odd...,"This story is a little odd and disturbing...the thought of the mother coming into the son's room as an adult and ""holding him"". It's just awkwardly written. The overall message of never ending love is understood but the author's clumsy and repetitive delivery is unbearable. A better choice: I Love You This Much."
2,Only Mom to Hate this book,"I find this book a tad bit freakish. Yes it starts out sweet but when your kid is a teen, adult, old man coming home to sit in your lap and nuzzle up - it's kind of freaky weird. It's toooooo involved between mom and son. And the kid does some rotten things. Plus it puts it in a kids face way to early that your mom is going to up and die one day. I may be the only mom (definately the only one i know) that hates this book. My kids don't like it either. The artwork isn't interesting and the lyrics not so rhythmic. The four copies we were given as gifts I sent right to the resale book store after trying for weeks to like this book."
1,Weird,"This is the weirdest chidren's book I have ever read. I had to throw it away, could not even give it away!!!!"
2,Not a fan,"Everyone I know seems to adore this book, but I'm not a fan. The message is sweet, but goes a little over the top to the point of a little weird and uncomfortable. Could've been good until she keeps rocking her son when he's an adult...."
1,Terrible- leaves you feeling empty,"I was unfortunate enough to have this book read to me as a child and every time it left me feeling sad, hopeless, and scared. To an adult with kids it probably seems like a great way to remind their kids that no matter what they're special, but whenever it was read to me it left me with one message: YOU'RE MOMMY IS GONNA DIE ONE DAY!!!!!!!! AND WHEN SHE DOES, YOU'LL COPE WITH IT BY SINGING THE SAME ASSININE LULLABY TO YOUR NEW BABY!!!! The book feels bleak, surrupy, and sad for all involved. Go read kids some Chris Van Allsburg or Berinstein Bears. Stay as far away as humanly possible from this paragon of disillusionment. My 3rd grade teacher read this to me on the first day of 3rd grade. I hated 3rd grade."
1,Creepy & sad,"Sad, scary, creepy. I can't believe it's so popular and that everybody doesn't have a problem with this dysfunctional mother/child relationship. The mother's actions are inappropriate and invasive and it is not surprising that once her son has reached adulthood, he has a child but, seems not to have a wife. Spooky drawings of the mother crawling around, too. Lastly, it's sad when the adoring mother is too old & sick to stalk her son. Overall, one of the wierdest & worst."
1,"Sorry, this book is going in the trash","I've read many of the other reviews and I am shocked at the positive comments. The first time I read this to my son it creeped me out. The idea of the mother sneaking into her grown son's house at night...through a window! The illustration of the car with the ladder on top driving over in the middle of the night. If she hadn't crawled around the floor, or maybe if she sang the song to her grown son while she was just over visiting, or maybe if she just stroked his hair rather than picking him up bodily. I'm all for unconditional love...but yikes. This is going into the trash."
2,Yuck!,"I know many people love this book, but I am definitely not one of them. I almost like the sing-song refrain (""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always...""), but when I read this book, I can't help thinking the mother should be institutionalized. Crawling across her son's floor? Stalking her adult son? Really! And even that refrain, ""as long as I'm living my baby you'll be""--isn't she supposed to raise her son to be an adult, not her ""baby""? I read this book to my son a few times, but it has since been put away. It gives me the creeps."
4,all-age appropriate,"This book was given to me by my mother when I had a house-full of 4 children under the age of 4. I was busy, and set it aside for a day or two, until she said, "" Read the book today, then call me."" I read it, called her, and was told that she had terminal lung cancer. This book was the only way my mother could tell me how she felt about me. She was never one to be open about her feelings, and I honestly cannot remember her telling me she loved me, until the last 6 months of her life. By then I was over 35, and she started with this book.I would recommend this book for any age, any gender. The love it speaks of is one we all need to remember, and share with those close to us, even if we have to do it by sharing this book.Yes, there are a couple of extremes...climbing in her grown son's window?....but the message is one of importance. Read it."
5,"This is a heartwarming, extremely touching book!","I just read this book yesterday (the French version, actually!) for the first time. It was a gift from a friend, so I read it aloud to my 7 month old son, and by the time I reached the end I was in tears! I can't believe that anyone could actually find this book offensive or misguided in any way, it is a pure expression of a mother's limitless love for her child. Sure, it's preposterous that a mom would really drive across town with a ladder on the roof of her car to sneak in her son's room and rock him and sing to him while he's sleeping, but I think any loving parent can relate to the sentiment! It's only a story, people! I think this is one of the most heartfelt, sweetest books I've ever read, and I would highly recommend it for children and parents alike!"
5,THIS BOOK HAS MEANT MORE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER :),"This book has meant more to me than all others. I am 16 years old and yesterday I was in class and my teacher was talking to us about our first reading experiences in life. I instantly thought of this book and my eyes became a little misty. It has been SO long since I thought of it! I think every child should grow up with this book. Every year when you look back on this book you will find a deeper meaning within it. When I was young (3 or 4) I admired the funny illustrations and recited the poem every second. I also thought the ending was happy. But now, as I go over the book 12 years later I realise how sweet it is! I never realised the message of the book. It's a wonderful book, definetly, and I think all parents should bye it for their chilren AND for themselves. If you are a mother I'm sure it will touch very close to your heart. It's incredibly sweet. I love it!"
5,Love You Forever,"My boys love this book. They cannot imagine ever growing up and leaving home, but knowing mom can visit when they are gone is a nice thought for them to carry with them. Although, I don't think I'll be visiting thru the window with a ladder...they still get the point. They ask me to read this book over and over. Each child (3) has his own copy and will pass it down to his children. I have read it and brought tears and joy at baby showers, given the book away, and it is loved any loving place its shared."
1,If Satan wrote childrens books...,"I happened to read this story one day at the store while Christmas shopping. Holy cow! What a G.D.mess this one is!!! This story honestly and literally gave me a really disturbed feeling. And I'm a 31 year old grown man. The cover looks innocent enough like any other kids book. But once inside, you find out just how bizarre and creepy this book really is. Just really, really weird. Disturbing would be the best word to describe it. I would NOT recommend this book to ANYONE, children OR adults, unless you hate them and want them to have nightmares."
2,distressing to children,"I do not like this book. Don't hate it, but I don't like it, either. This is my mother's favorite children's book, and I vividly recall her reading it to me for the first time when I was 3 years old. It was very distressing because I didn't want to think about my mother dying AND because my mom always cried when she read it- didn't like that, either! My older brother felt the same way. Young kids aren't good at differentiating between sad tears and happy/emotional tears. Every once in a while I would let her read it because I knew she liked it, but I did not at all. Do you really want your child to feel like they have to submit to something that distresses them just because they want to make you happy? Also now that I'm adult, I too find the whole ""creeping into adult son's bed"" disturbing. I didn't pick up on that as a child (and I doubt most children would), but it's the final nail in the coffin for this book in my mind."
1,WOW,"We were given this book by two different friends (both parents of boys). I actually thought it was some kind of wierd joke the first time I read it. It is sweet in an odd way, but way to creepy. It's worth a read (at the library), for a good laugh."
1,Avoid this very disturbing book.,"This book is bizarre. My wife and I heard about it at a birth class. It was recommended in connection with sibling issues. So we bought it, sight unseen. However, instead of dealing with the problems a young child might face when a new baby comes along, this book is about the weird love of a mother for her son. She may love him, but she can't tell him. She can only sneak into his room at night and rock him while saying the verse that's repeated over and over in the book. Sound innocent? She crawls into his room when he's a teenager and climbs a ladder into his bedroom when he's a grown man gone from home. This is weird behavior. The book should be called ""My Eternal, Obsessive, Creepy Love."" Avoid this very disturbing book."
1,Gave my son nightmares,"I was given this book as a baby gift when my son was born. My friend said it is her daughters favorite story. When my son was about three years old I read it to him. BIG MISTAKE! He became obsessed with my mortality. He wasnt really sure what was happening at the end but he said it was really really bad. I should have followed my first instinct when I read it and thrown it away, I would'nt have been kept up with so many nightmares. He just saw the cover picture as I was typing this and said "" Never read that again!"""
4,What I liked about your book,I thought the message about a mother's love for her child was very well expressed in this story. I especially liked the ending when the father could relate those same feelings for his own child.
4,Hugs and kisses,"I really liked this book, it made me feel happy and sad. I really liked how the Mom sang to the child. And at the end when the son was singing to his Mom made me feel sad, because his Mom was getting old and couldn't sing the rest of the song to him."
1,Creepy.,"I'm sorry, but I have to share that I think this is the creepiest kid's book I have ever read. It was given to me by a good lovely friend who cries when she reads this, so obviously everyone is different but I really think that the sentimentality in this book borders on bizarre in a very uncomfortable way. I have other Munsch books and they do not capture my child's attention either but this one is the worst. A mother who sneaks into her kid's room to recite her desperate litany/ then again as he is a teen/ again when he is living on his own and then he comes to her as she dies and then starts the cycle over with his child - almost sounds charming - but isn't. I think it is the ladder that gets me."
2,CREEPY!,"I bought this book because I thought of it as a 'classic' and I remembered the refrain, ""I love you forever. I like you for always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be."", which is really sweet.When I read it, however, I was really creeped out from the point where the son is a teenager and the mom is still sneaking in his room and rocking him, onward. When she drives across town and sneaks in her grown son's window, well, that is just WAY over the top.Imagine if you (as a wife) woke up and your mother-in-law was in your bedroom holding your husband and singing to him -- that's stuff of psycho-thriller movies.Also, I don't really want my preschool age son thinking about me getting old and senile one day and him having to take care of me. That subject matter is just too heavy for him at his age, in my opinion."
2,Scares my daughter (and me!),"I got this book as a shower gift for my first child from someone who said the book used to make her cry and cry each time she read it to her kids. Uh....I don't think so. What I think is that this book is creepy. It says the mother waits until the baby is asleep then ""crawls"" across the floor and cradles the baby and rocks him and tells him that she loves him. I just don't get it. Why doesn't she tell the boy she loves him when he is awake? Why does she ""crawl"" around on the floor? One of the illustrations of her kneeling on the floor and peeking into the child's room really scares my daughter. It is really creepy. And the verses are absolutely corny! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I really like that there are cats in the illustrations."
2,It's just not all that good,"Sorry guys, I just don't think this book is very good. I'm not sure that I can agree with the ""incest"" angle that some reviewers have taken, I just didn't enjoy it. FOr one thing, it's sappy. It plays on too many stereotypes. AND every woman I know has gotten at least one or two copies at their babyshower. For my money? Buy Owl Babies instead."
1,Only Book I've Ever Thrown Out,"This is the only book I've ever actually thrown in the trash. Read the reviews to judge for yourself... even the 5-star reviewers rave about how it makes them cry every time they read it. What child needs to see their mother crying all the time? Can't we just let our kids be kids without having to lay on the heavy-duty stuff? Making them think of the time when their mother will lay dying? There are better, happy ways to convey what love is without laying on the concern and guilt that this book brings. Read it for yourself if you need your own reminder about what love is... in my opinion, children don't need it."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!,"I got this book for my friend who is having a baby, She LOVED IT! It turns out that her mom read it to her when she was little, but they had lost the book. My own story isn't much different, my mom would read this book to my brother and I before we went to sleep. The book was ripped and torn from years of use. I don't even need the book anymore because I have it memorized. Anyway, great book, great story, worth every penny :)"
5,Love It!,"This has always been a favorite of mine, and my kids, now it's a favorite of the grand children! Thanks"
3,Customer,This book was used and it wasn't what I was expected it to be unformulately I kept the book to read to my grandchildren.
4,A great book for parent and child,"I just heard this book read aloud to my class. As I listened to the story, I pictured my twin girls in my arms. Maybe I'm just becoming sappy in my advanced age, but the book really touched me. I'm sure my girls will enjoy hearing mommy or daddy reading this book to them. The message to all kids is that you will always be your parents' child and their love for you is unconditional. What better message can we send our children?"
3,"cute idea, cute illustrations, but a bit creepy, IMHO","I liked the book until the part where the elderly mother drags herself across her middle-aged son's floor... Where I'm from, that's not love; I believe it's called ""invasion of privacy."""
5,Great book,"My mother and I read this book to my brother years ago from ages 1 1/2 until 5. I cried the first time I read it to my son. Amazing story, beautiful words. It's a must have for children"
1,Disappointed...,"I purchased this book for a Mother's day gift, and was sadly disappointed when I received it and read the content. It starts off cute with a mother rocking her baby to sleep, and again when he's two, and again when he's 9.... Then a teenager. The most disturbing part was when the son grew up and moved out, and the mother drove to his house in the middle of the night and snuck in through his window and rocked this grown man while in his bed. This is very weird to me. Not at all what I was expecting and I plan to return it."
1,I should have heeded the warnings of the 1 star reviewers!,"I bought this book hoping for a lovely tale of how a mother loves her child, well, forever.What I got was a weird, creepy story about a mom who can't let go.As I read through it for the 1 and only time I realized I hated this book. First, it didn't rhyme--and I like books that rhyme or have sing-songy verse. There was too much reading per page for my young children. Worst was the fact that this mom crept into her son's room while he was sleeping(even as a teenager and stalked him down at his house as a grown man) to hold him (as in picks him up) and repeats the same flat verse...""I love you forever, I'll like you for always (what does that mean?), As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be.""At the end of the book my 5yr old suggested we throw it out the window.I thought about it.But...we will donate it to anyone who'll take it.A much better book to get would be, ""I love you through and through"". My kids and I all LOVE that one."
5,Sweetest book ever!,I read this to my children when they were little and now that my first grand baby is on its way I bought it for my son. I plan to give it to each of my children when they have their first child. A book to share though the generations. I had trouble reading it without weeping and my son would laugh at me but now I think he will understand. My children loved the book when they were little and I know they will continue loving it and love sharing it with their own families.
4,Makes One Misty Eyed,"I realize that not everyone will like this book regardless of age, but that can be said about anything. I thought the story was lovely - a mother telling her son all throughout his life that she will always love him forever. The story ends with her taking a ladder and climbing into her grown son's window to continue the loving routine. When advanced age and infirmity prevent her from doing this, then the son takes over the role."
2,....got creepy at the end!,"I heard about this book through a friend and even saw it being read on an episode of 'Friends'. Well, I got the book and it was wonderful and very heartfelt up until the part where moms is thiefing her way into her son's window to hold him. Ewww....I got chills and not the good kind. So this book, although sweet at the start, turned ihto something out of Jerry Springer really fast. I do not recommend this book unless you only plan to read half of it."
5,Love You Forever,"I sent it as a gift to my daughter, who has a two year old son, and it brought tears to her eyes."
1,Calling Mr. Freud!,"I purchased this book for my sons after having read the first few pages. The beginning is achingly sweet. Upon our arrival home, my wife got out the book to read to our two-year-old. The book gets strange fast. We found ourselves struggling not to react negatively when ""Mommy"" is shown driving across town in the dead of night with a ladder on the roof of her station wagon. Her intent? A little nocturnal Breaking and Entering into her now-adult son's home so she can rock him in her arms. Are you kidding me? Eewww. Then we continue on to the part where Mommy is now on Death's door and too weak to sneak around. So naturally, Sonny boy visits his mother to rock her in his arms. You get the impression that she then dies so he goes home to rock his infant daughter. Yikes. What a shame. This book could have been really wonderful. Instead, it went directly into the trash. I had never before envisioned myself relegating a book to the trash heap but in this case, it seemed important."
1,Freakiest Book Ever,"This book is about a psychopath Mom who stalks her son. It's beyond creepy. Any real mother who acted like this would be locked away in an insane asylum, or prison.And I AM a mother with 4 adorable children. Two are sons, my youngest is my baby-boy.But I still think this book is disturbing in what it promotes. It is not healthy for anyone to think this behavior is okay.I didn't buy the book, it was given to us in a bag-o-books. I can see why someone wanted to get rid of it....CREEEEPY sums it up"
1,Creepy is the word ... and bizzarely time-warped!,"OK, not only is this book creepy in all the ways numerous negative reviewers point out, but the artwork is unintentionally hilarious. The boy grows from a 9-year-old in the 1970s or so to a teenager in the 1950s (soda bottles, a turntable, and a zig-zag sweater) to a man in the 1980s (microwave, computer). Vile and incompetent both in storyline and artwork."
1,Not appropriate for children,"One of the most disturbing children's books I have ever seen. My wife purchased this after rave reviews by people we know. We both came to the same conclusion after reading it; a disturbing story about a compulsive woman that would never be exposed to our child.In my opinion, this book has a high probability of causing long lasting subconscious effects on your child. Please, carefully read and think about the message conveyed before subjecting your young ones to this. I would argue that this book is not appropriate to read to any child."
1,Creepy,"Sorry, I know a lot of people really love this book and think its message is very sweet, but it gives me the willies. I get the same icked out feeling from The Runaway Bunny, FWIW."
5,BEST MOST TOUCHING CHILDRENS BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't get the negative reviews on this book. The book demonstrates the deep love a mother and son have for eachother. It's the most touching childrens book I have ever read. Everytime my kids and I read the book we both cry. You might find that strange but the book reminds us both of the great love we have for eachother and to charish every moment we spend together. The people that are criticzing the book keep on mentioning the part of the book were the mother holds her son as a teen, well remember this is a childrens book. The book is an overall symbol of love not to be scrutinized."
5,"Looks almost new, even though condition was listed as 'good'!","This book seriously looks brand new, except for a little bit of writing on a blank page before the title page. I would've never guessed it was used if the writing wasn't there! Excellent!"
1,Incredibly creepy,"I found this book to be very creepy. I actually threw it in the trash, the first time I have EVER done that with a book. The mom skulking around sneaking into the kid's room was just not right. I can see where the author was trying to go with the story, but the execution was terrible. I don't understand the fascination with this book at all."
1,Disturbing,"I am grateful to my mom for not loving me in a way this woman loves her son and I feel sorry for people loved this way. ""I hate the fact you're growing up, I don't have a single nice word about you and seeing who you are becoming is driving me crazy, so I'll infantilize you because only if I pretend that you are little baby without character and completely dependent on me, I can love you. So you'll always be my little baby. <3""No, he will not, go and see a shrink, lady, before you screw up your son. Oops, too late. To bad she died so young, I bet she'd be wonderful mother-in-law.This book is so disturbing that it provoked me to write my first review here. Yes, it is that bad."
1,"creepy book and morbid way to show kids that you, too, will die.","What is the point of driving home mortality to a kid. ""Look, Kid, your parents are going to get old and die and leave you alone some day ... mwoo ha ha ha ha."" this is a stupid book with no point. it tries to be emotive for emotive sake, but the end result is a morbid heap of trash. skip it!"
5,For Mothers of Sons,"Robert Munsch is one of my abolutely favorite children's authors. I used his highly humerous books for many years as a Reading/Literacy teacher. This book is a departure from his usual books, as it isn't really funny, but moving. By the time I get to the end, I, and my audiance, are near to tears. This is expecially true of Mothers of sons. I recently purchased a copy to read to my friend who had sons. They all enjoyed it."
5,Beautiful Book!!!!!,"This book is just beautiful. I remember the first time I heard this book. My husband and I was attending our 2nd child's pre-K orientation and the teacher read this book. I was 8 months pregnant with our 3rd and last baby and had lost my mother the year earlier. The words in the book touched my soul. My sister after hearing me talk about this book gave it to me for a gift. Some years later, when my oldest son and his wife had their first child, I gave my book to them. I purchased this book to save to give as a gift to my son who was just starting pre-K at the time when this book's story ""message"", was introduced to me ,when he begins his family. The shipping was quick and the book arrived in perfect condition."
5,a great bed time book,I got this book for my son when he was 3. It became a bedtime favorite and if I didn't read it I had to at least sing the song EVERY NIGHT. He is now 13 and when his little brother came on to the scene a few months ago he went to his bookcase and pulled this book out and had me read it to his brother. ( he has kept his copy.)He has even adjusted the words of the song to fit him and his little brother. The impact of knowing what ever you do your mom will still be your mom (or big brother) and love you is a strong message.
1,Also found this book creepy,"We received this as a gift and I just broke it out recently at bedtime. It seemed sweet enough but when the mom continues to crawl across the room at night and take her teenager into her arms - I thought, huh?!? Then when she drives across town with a ladder to sneak into her grown son's room to do the same thing? I think this one will go into the donate pile unfortunately - it's just too weird for my taste."
1,~Kind of creepy~,"My grandson received this as a gift. He is four years old and when my daughter got to the end she felt creeped out and changed books. They are very close.....but she wasn't comfortable w/the ending......the mother driving across town w/a ladder and then the son rocking his elderly dying mother. It felt too bizarre for a four year old. There are so many wonderful, magical books out there regarding mother/child relationships.....I'd say save your money and buy a different, less disturbing book."
1,The mother SCARES my son,"I bought this book because so many people raved about it. That should've been a sign, I guess. I read it once to my son, and half way through the story he says: ""That mother is scary. I don't like her."" I agreed 100% with him. It's unnerving and creepy. I know what kind of message the author was trying to convey, but I don't agree with the way he approached it. I'm out in left field with this one. I don't understand what all the raving is about."
2,Disappointed,"This book purchased thru Amazon, was not the one originally published. It looks like it was a digital re-print. I give this book to almost every parents of a newborn, both girls and boys. It is a family favorite. This book was not the quality of the publisher print. The story is still wonderful, but the presentation is not the same. I ordered both paper back and hard copy. Both were a dissapointment for giving."
4,"A parenting primer, a childs anthology","Robert Munsch puts into words the emotions of every parent who knows that the lasting legacy you give to your children is ""love"". And once every child who experiences the true love of their parent(s)is grown, will pass this greatest of all treasures on to the future."
1,"Should be titled ""How to raise a Serial Killer""","The mom in this book is disturbed. Period.I think her son was featured in a Criminal Minds episode.Is anyone else reminded of the relationship of Norman Bates and his mom?And for those of you who aren't convince this is disturbing, think about how it ends, with the boy singing to his daughter. Picture him doing what his mother did..ewwwww!"
1,"Maudlin, skip it","This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much. There are sentimental stories, but this is just plain maudlin."
1,This is a downer book... very inappropriate for this age audience,"There is a time for everything, and if you enjoy the pseudo-""philosophical value"" of this book, my 4 years old didn't and neither did I, it's confusing, there is nothing a child can relate to... way too ambitious... let there be children..."
5,Exceptional,"My wife and I have three children, all adult now, and throughout their childhood we constantly read to them because we wanted them to be avid readers as we ourselves are. We recently sifted through all of their childhood books, of which there are many. ""Love You Forever"" is probably the most memorable of them all. It is an original and profoundly touching narrative, beautifully illustrated, of the permanent and unconditional love of a parent for her or his child. (Those who find ""creepiness"" in it are either concrete readers or need therapy for their unresolved personal issues). As her child grows up, it is in her own mind and emotions that she continues to hold and embrace the child she brought into the world, as he and she pass through their respective stages of life. The cycle of life is then completed in the beautiful conclusion that teaches young and not so young about the essence of life. If this book is not in your children's library, then it is incomplete."
2,Just slightly creepy,The poem sticks with you and so I purchased this book again after having not read it for many years. The story is cute until the grown man is still rocked by his mother. Not sure I'd recommend it.
1,Creepy,"I agree with the other sentiments that this book is creepy. Yes, the mother loves her son and her love is touching. However, there are other ways she could express her love to her son as he ages without sneaking in and out of his room and house. I think her passive love is creepy."
1,Creepy,"As a librarian I have tolerantly smiled as many teachers at our school rave about this book. Personally, I think it is creepy. The mother climbing into her grown son's window and putting him on her lap and the son, putting his elderly mother on his lap. If the first one happened, most sons would install better locks and an alarm system. You don't see the second one happening at nursing homes. It is demeaning and, well, just creepy and odd. It does not strike me as an expression of love. More like a personality disorder. I love Munsch's humorous stories, i.e., Stephanie's Ponytail. I share them often with my students. But I will pass on this one. The yuck factor is too high for me."
1,drivel,"yeah, so I don't like it and I hate that my two year old does. everything i feel has already been said -- it's not normal to think that this is normal. where are the other family relationships? i doubt these people have healthy adult relationships with their parents/children when they grow up."
1,Disturbing on many levels,My daughter received this book as a gift for her first Christmas from one of her aunts. I had never read the book so of course I wanted to check it out. Is this author insane? Is my sister in law insane? This is the most disturbing children's book I have ever read. I hid it in the back of my daughter's closet not to be found for a very long time.
1,I also found this story strange. . .,"I read this book at a bookstore and decided not to purchase it. While I appreciate the unconditional love the mother has for her son, I found it disturbing that she would drive across town and crawl into his window to rock him while he slept, etc. I also found those illustrations bizarre. I don't think it's suitable for a child - what four year old wants to hear about his sick mother? It's more suited to touch the emotions of the reader than the listener. Perhaps an older child (teenager) would appreciate it."
1,Creepy and upsetting,"I got this book for my two year old girl. The images of the Mom sneaking in rocking the baby no matter what size he was scared her. She is never scared by books but she started to cry. I found the images creepy as well. A Mom sneaking and rocking her teenage son-Disturbing. I DO NOT recommend this book. There are many better Love books. Try ""You are my I Love You""."
1,Adults LOVE this book...,"The story is quite common to children's books--a mother expresses love for her child, and her child loves her back. If you enjoy a good cry, you'll even excuse the author's banal treatment.Yes, adults LOVE this book, but most kids can take it or leave it. My kids have not seemed to care much for it, and I'd rather read them books _they_ enjoy.If you'd like to read your child a book that shows a mother's love in a way children truly appreciate, try ""The Runaway Bunny"" by Margaret Wise Brown."
1,"A Book for a Mother, not a child","This book is read and cherished by mothers of sons. This book reinforces a mother's greatest wish. ""I cared for him for a long time, changed his diapers, wiped his tears. Now even though he has married a woman who is not NEAR good enough for him, and whom I disregard, he will come back to me when I need him and he will change MY diapers (ewwww), and wipe MY tears. This so-called spouse he has selected might not usurp my power over him, at least when I grow old and feeble and needy."" THAT is the meaning of the book when I read it. I would bet that the majority of proponents of this book are females who have high hopes of reciprocity from their grown sons.Mother-love for a son is sacred, but surely defining it doesn't include crawling on her belly, or climbing ladders, or totally ignoring his wife. We are wise to seek out more healthy books with which to teach this to our children."
1,Can you have negative stars?,"This book is just horrible. I agree with the one-star postings here and am only posting to register on the star system. Creepy, disturbing and potentially very upsetting are words that come to mind. This book is not suitable for a child or anyone.I cannot understand anyone who thinks it is anything but awful, really."
1,This book seems to depict a mother with serious issues.,"I do not understand how people can claim this is a healthy depiction of a mother's love. The mother in this book understands no boundaries. It is very creepy that she sneaks into her grown son's room using a ladder after driving across town. While I understand and approve of the concept of unconditional love and being a mother myself have often told my girl that she will always be my baby, I do not believe in the extreme links this mother went to. Why does everyone ignore the obvious mental health issues?"
1,I agree - this book is for warped minds,"I was given this book and only recently got around to reading it to my children (we have lots of books to get through!). It starts out cute, and very quickly declines in to ""strange behaviour"". I'm a mother of 4 children whom I love dearly, and I do NOT want them to think that I'll be sneaking in to their homes later in life whilst they sleep. How creepy is that. And I really hope my son does not grow as a man who sleeps with his teddy and sucks his thumb. I'm shocked this book was published. Hollywood could make a really creepy movie out of this one."
4,I love it.,"A very moving book. It reminds me of an onion, in that, as a child grows up, they can reread the story, and come away with a different perspective every time. Right now, my 4 year old thinks it's a story about a naughty boy whose mommy still loves him, even though he is bad. Later she will understand the ideas of unconditional love, the cycles of life, mother/child bonds, etc.I believe that those people who called it creepy read the book more literally than was intended. I hope we can all agree that it is a bad idea to climb into the window of a house that does not belong to you in the dead of night...um, right? (Gosh, I hope my mother in law is reading this!)Just kidding mom!Seriously, this is not a silly story, and not even a simple story, but it is a good story. I would read it yourself first, to anticipate any of the tough questions your kids might have for you...it is definitely thought-provoking."
1,This is just wrong!!,"There is something very disturbing about a mother who puts a ladder on her car and drives to her newly married son's house and climbs through his window. I understand what the sentiment is supposed to be and I like the idea of the ""circle of life"" but really???!!! It's just wrong!!"
5,Wonderful! My OB gave it to me as a gift and we love it!,My 2yo son asks for this book by name for his bedtime story.
3,"Sweet Refrain, Odd Imagery","Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyLove You Forever explores the unbreakable bond between mother and son, but goes too far for many readers. It has an appealing refrain to reassure your child you will ""like him for always"" and ""love him forever."" The rhythm of this refrain makes it a good choice to read to babies. However, as children get older, they may feel uncomfortable watching the mother climb in through the window of her adult son's bedroom. Boys seem particularly uneasy about the illustration of the grown-up son rocking the aging mother in his arms."
3,Sweet look at the mother/son relationship,"""Love You Forever"" is a story that will get mothers everytime. Although somewhat unbelievable, the story is cute and the illustrations funny. When the tear came to my eye at the end of the story, it immediately reminded me of the book ""Something to Remember Me By"" by Susan Bosak. What a touching story about the grandaughter/grandmother relationship! The illustrations alone make the book a must have, and the perfect gift for a grandmother in the family. You ""Love You Forever"" fans won't be dissappointed."
4,It makes me cry everytime!,"I was a nanny and this book was a favorite with the kids. Not because they enjoyed the story, although, they did, but because it made me cry. I would really choke up at the end and couldn't finish some of the sentences and they thought that was pretty funny. I love this story and I love the sentiment in it. I hope you enjoy it, too."
5,So touching and sweet!!!,"The first time I read this book, I couldn't finish because I started to cry. When I saw the man rocking his mother, that did it! I recommend getting this book to share with your whole family."
3,Incomplete description,"Item is in decent condition, as described. However there is an inscription on the inside of the front cover which was not in the item description."
5,Very Touching,"This book has been a favorite of mine,eventhough each time I read it to my class I find myself wiping tears from my eyes. It is a very touching, exceptional, and heart warming book. I Love It.Gloria"
5,Love You Forever,"This book is a perfect gift for new parents, teachers, any age mother in the world. Great lesson and morals and ethics!"
5,IF EVERY MOTHER TRULY FELT THIS WAY...,"There is just one thing that I have to say about this book. If every mother truly felt and behaved in the same way as the mother in this story, the world would never have any Jeffery Dahmer's or John Wayne Gacy's. As a psychotherapist, I must agree with the research that supports the notion that ""Mother"" is a significant figure in the development of a child's personality. It is the lack of this type of unconditional love that can create adult emotional and mental disturbances. Every mother and mother-to-be needs to own a copy of this book; And every female needs to read and think about the true meaning of this story before making the decision to have children!!!Every word of this story describes my feelings towards my computer ""whiz"" kid son, Eagle Scout, Alvin Joseph Michael Reed!!!"
3,Small,This is one of my children's favorite books. So I purchased it for my brand new great nephew and I was a little dissapointed that it was small and the shipping was more than the cost of the book. Still a great read for children.
3,Would be a better book for older children.,Cute book but does not hold my 21 month sons attention. The pictures are ok but not the best book I have found. Will buy more Karma Wilson books instead of books like this. Would probably be better for older children.
1,Over rated!!,"How this book came to be so popular is beyond me. I bought it years ago when I heard people raving about it. Please! Yes, it is natural for a mother to love her child forever and hopefully the feeling is returned, but the bizarre way parent-child love is presented in this book is unnatural and borders on a weird, unhealthy relationship!"
1,This is a very sick book,Love you Forever portrays a bizarre and sick relationship between a child and mother. It portrays the mothers' dependency on her child's infancy as an ideal. Where is the father? Why is this mother crawling across the floor to see her sleeping son? Why is she climbing a ladder and crawling across the son's bed when he is grown? What is the moral of this book? That a mother will always perceive her child as a baby and not as a mature adult? I cannot understand the popularity and praise of this extraordinarily disturbing book
1,Stalk You Forever,"This book creeps me out so much. It creeps my 9-year-old son out as well. In fact, it's become a running joke between us that as soon as he turns 40, I'm going to go get a ladder, and he's going to get a restraining order. But maybe that's just us. There is something intensely disturbing to me about the image of an elderly mother sneaking through her grown son's second-story bedroom window to drag him, sleeping, out of bed and rock him in her lap. I don't find it funny or charming, just creepy. And please don't tell me I don't ""get it"". I understand what the author was going for here; I just think he missed the mark, and my son thinks so, too."
1,Disturbing book,"I remember reading this when I was a child and being disturbed at the thought of my parents getting old and sick, too sick to move or speak like the book-mom. Ghastly. Now I see it here while looking for a book for my new niece! No way am I going to give this one, on the off-chance that she might be upset by it the way I (and, according to other reviews here, many others) had been."
1,Is this meant for children or overly sappy adults?,"The little boy is throwing toilet paper around and flushing his mother's watch down the toilet. The teenager seems ignorant and tracks mud throughout the house.I'm sorry, these are not suggestions I want to give to my child. The sentiment of loving the child forever no matter what is cute, but it's creepy the way the mother goes about expressing her love for her child.And the end of the book? Well, I know reality is good to teach and we'll all die someday, but the implications of the mother dying after being too sick to talk/sing are very dramatic take a potentially sentimental story to a very sad level. I recieved this book as a gift and it is being donated to goodwill. Perhaps someone else will find the value in it."
1,one of the sappiest least child oriented books I've ever seen,"This books is for adults, not children. It is sickeningly sweet and sappily sentimental. It is designed to tug at adult heartstrings not entertain or inform children."
5,baby gift,This is one of my all time favorite books. My kids loved to hear it over and over again growing up and it makes a great addition to any baby shower gift.
3,"I don't care for it, but my son loves it...","My three-year-old son has both Love You Forever and Guess How Much I Love You in his bookcase, and he never asks for Guess How Much I Love You and always asks for Love You Forever. I don't particularly care for it; it's not very well-written and the illustrations bother me, but I have never felt it was weird or creepy. Isn't part of being a parent recognizing that your child may have preferences that are different from yours?"
1,No stars,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. As a daughter-in-law and devoted mother of a son and daughter, I would never give this book as a gift. I love my children desperately, and do not want them to think about Mommy dying any sooner than they have to, or to create boundary issues. Boys have a hard enough time cutting the apron strings and don't need to be made to feel guilty. I love the sentiment this book is trying to convey, but it stepped way over the boundary line."
1,Is there such a thing as ZERO stars?,"This has got to be the freakiest children's book I have ever read. It's about a mother who can't let go of her children and who resorts to literally crawling across her son's floor in the middle of the night -- throughout his life -- just to hold him. I'd like to think that the many folks who have given this book praise are not mentally unstable, but can't help but wonder. This book is for tjose mothers trying to justify the use of their own talons in the lives of their children. It's an unhealthy demonstration of positive parent/child relationships and should not be placed in any home, much less read or even published anymore. I strongly recommend against this book -- unless of course, you're a psychotic mother is serious need of mental help. If you click ""purchase"", the next thing I'd recommend doing is admitting you need help and finding a psychiatrist ASAP. This is not a good book; this is a tragedy."
1,A Litmus Test for Wackos,"Like many of the other 1-star reviews, I too found this book to be disturbing and mawkish. I have experienced the death of a loved one -- in fact I did so at a rather young age -- and I assure you that this book will not help a child deal with the passing of a loved one. It is insipid and creepy; it is the sort of thing that would inspire a Wes Craven film. Aside from the story-line, though, the art is amateurish and the characters have that stilted, too-real-to-be-real quality that often makes cheap dolls look so sinister. In short, it is a $20,000 therapy bill waiting to happen. If you love your children, and will love them forever, then don't inflict ""Love You Forever"" on them..."
1,Touching...then creepy,"This book started off touching, if a little strange. Once the child got into his teens and the mom was creeping into the room and rocking him and singing to him, it got slightly creepy. When the mom drove over to his house when he was an adult, where he slept in a twin bed by himself, put up a ladder and broke in through his window and picked him up while he slept and rocked him and sang...that was ultra creepy.Adults might be able to pull the heartwarming message out of this story and kids might not quite understand the creepiness, but there are better stories to teach about unconditioanl love. Everyone is entitled to enjoy it if it resonates for them, but for me, it just feels silly and creepy. I would much prefer to read a book that both I and my children can enjoy."
2,It could have been so much better-what a shame!,"I really wanted to like this book. The message that a parent will love their child no matter how frustrated they get was so touching, yet completely derailed by the mother's later unhealthy, obsessive exhibits of her love. Sneaking across town and into your grown child's house is not a healthy way to show love. Metaphor or not the author could have shown the steadfastness of parental love throughout time in a much better way. I'd recommend Lisa McCourt's ""The Most Thankful Thing"" instead of this book."
1,Unpleasant topic,"I found this book to be unbelievably unpleasant. I can't understand why anyone would want to read it to a child, unless you know you are ready to teach your child about death. When I read it to my young child I did not know that's what it was about. The cover makes it look like a cute children's story and it is cute for a little while. Overall I would say that reading this book to a child unprepared was very upsetting."
1,suspenseful and scary,"Had heard it was a great child's book, then I realized it was in fact more in the ""Suspense/Thriller"" genre...The scene where the mom cruises across town to stalk the son, raises a ladder to his window and sneaks into his bedroom is positively frightening - caught me offguard...well done! Not for the faint of heart..."
1,CREEPY BOOK!,"if you think it's not very very strange that a mother would climb in the window of her grown son's house, pull him out from bed with his wife and rock him like a baby, then you might enjoy this book."
4,Love You Forever,"""Love You Forever"" is a story about a mother and her child. Throughout the story, it tells about how her child grows up and changes during his life. In the book, it tells how no matter what her child is like, she will always love him. At night she sometimes creeps into his bedroom and sings ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. After doing this for many years, she gets old and sick, so her son comes to her house and sings it to her. Then he takes up the tradition and starts singing it to his newborn child.I think this is a pretty good book because even though it is a bit repetitive and can get a bit boring it gets across a pretty good point. It shows the love that is between a mother and her son. It shows the devotion to each other that each of them has."
1,Really?,"I feel that the message this book intends to convey will be misunderstood by young children, especially if they see the illustrations."
1,"yes, creepy!","I read this before becoming a parent and found it to be very disturbing. I was 21 at the time and my boy friend's mom bought it for him for his birthday. First few pages, I was like... ""oh sweet."" Then when we got to the later part of the book and I said told my BF at the time that I hope his mom was not sneaking in on us to rock him to sleep... *shudder*. This book is more for a parent who just can't let go then for explaining love to a child. I will not buy it for my daughter. I just can't imagine why any child would find this book comforting or fun!"
5,Wonderful for both child and Mother,"My son, now 4.2 yrs, and I have read this book often. He received it as a gift on his 2nd birthday. He enjoys it and will recall, ""I'll love you forever and like you for always, Mommy"" when we're together This book does tug at the emotions of young children as well as Mommy's. It's also a good jumping off book for talking about aging Grandparents et al."
4,Wonderful book,"This is the best book for anyone having a baby boy. Just wish they wrote one for baby girl""s. My niece loved it."
2,"Love the book, problems with the format","I love the story. I first owned the book when my son was born. I bought this for my kindle, and it will not format to fit the pages correctly for some reason. I am very disappointed."
1,Didn't like the message,This book is very popular with my husbands family so I got it at my baby shower - I didn't like it a bit. Infact I got rid of it. I think any mom that is driving across down to climb up a ladder and into a window to rock her son to sleep is just strange!! I was fine with the book until I saw the picture of her in the car with the ladder on top. I just find that creepy. I won't be reading this to my son and I dread the day I have to tell my inlaws not to read it to him either. Its just creepy!
5,BELOVED CHILDREN'S BOOK,This is a wonderful story about the unconditional love of a mother for her son.
1,Disturbing,This is the most disturbing children's book I have ever read. It starts off sweet enough but can you imagine if your mother in law snuck into your bedroom every night to rock your grown husband to sleep? I'd get a restraining order. Definitely better books out there that teach about unconditional love and parent/child relationships. I would never let my daughter read this book.
5,See This Book as a Winner for All Ages,"This is a touching book that is a wonderful read through all the generations. A grandparent can enjoy this book, but so can a six year old will also and together they can share an intimate moment where they both acknowledge the depth of meaning in the cycle of life. The illustrations are beautiful and the prose is lovely. Enjoy!"
1,This is Emotional Incest at its Finest! Sick Book!,"It is a mother's job to let her son go when he is a grown man, not to climb up to his window to rock him in his sleep. That is sick and creepy. This woman would be every wife's nightmare, the mother-in-law rival, the one who won't let her son grow up or let him go, the mother turned stalker. This is not something a mother should be writing about her son, its her job to raise her children right and let them go."
2,Children do not like this book,"I remember having this book read to me often in school as a child. I remember hating this book. I hated the pictures, I didn't understand the story. I am 19 years old now and I can remember to this day how awful this book was...to a child. It's a tear-jerker for some adults and so they assume children will love it, but that's a bad assumption. I remember thinking it was potty book, that's all it ever was to me. Now one of my favorite potty books was, ""Everyone Poops"" by Taro Gomi. That would be a much better read and the pictures are great, very informative!"
1,Creepy,"We received this book as a hand me down, I read it once and hid it (until I can donate it somewhere) so it never get read again to my children. I completely agree with creepy. There is nothing else I can say that the other one star reviews have not covered."
2,"A book for parents, not children","This book describes the unconditional love a parent has for his or her child in a way that I feel is less than ideal. It alludes to the mother's death (which isn't something I am interested in explaining to my child at this stage) and, although it is the mother in this case, makes children aware of the fact that someone could sneak into their room at night. From an adult's perspective the ideas in this book could be construed as sweet and sentimental, but this is a CHILDREN'S book and for that reason I would definitely recommend that parents keep looking (personally, I am a fan of Guess How Much I Love You)."
4,SO SWEET,I am sending copies of this book to new mothers of baby boys. I don't have any feedback yet.
3,"made me cry, even as a kid","A nice story about a parent's love. Now that I'm a mom, I understand it even more. But I still can't read it to my kids without crying, so what's the point? It's not in our house."
1,Creepy,I agree with most of the other 1 star reviews. The topic is depressing and way too heavy for small children. Who wants to talk about death and ageing at bedtime? This seems like a tough way to get to unconditional love. My sister gave this to my son so I cannot throw it away as I don't want to offend her. My wife also hates it.In addition to the above the book is poorly executed. The drawings are crude and the text is clumsily written.I think this book could be used in some sort of personality profile. It is fun to ask other parents what they think of this book.
1,Book is a codependence nightmare,"Given to me as a gift, I heard many glowing reviews of this book and was told it would leave me weeping. Not only was I dry-eyed at the end, but this book left a bad taste in my mouth. A mothers love? Not quite...more like a mother-son example of co-dependence. The son comes across as a spoiled little brat that the mom ""loves anyway."" She rocks him to sleep even as he becomes an adult...very healthy. No matter what the author intended, this book is only a lesson in bad parenting. It makes me nervous that so many people liked this book so much."
1,there are better books....,"I got the author's point about unconditional love... but I just don't like the fact that this book got some controversy issue. There are many ways of showing unconditional love in better ways than ""stalking"" the loved ones. no? And plus, I just don't like the setting with single mother and single dad. Why can a children's book depict happier and more ideal surrounding? Just for the fact that either people love this book with tears coming out or hate it to throw it away, i would not read this to my little one. There are many ways I can show her my unconditional love... I wouldn't want to be following my child around (for the ones who loved this book, I can understand) but I rather just be there for her whenever she needs me..."
1,"Terrible, disturbing children's book","I got this book for as a gift, and it's the most disturbing children's book I've ever read. The son goes from baby to grown man in 3 pages, and his mother ages about 3 times as fast as he does. In a few pages she's about 90 while her son is still young. Then, she calls to tell him she's dying, and he cradles her in his arms and sings to her?! There's no joy in it. It's a terrible, terrible book and I won't read it to my children. Stick with Goodnight Moon and go to bed happy!"
1,Creepy,"I can't understand why so many people seem to love this book so much. It starts out cute. But what is endearing about a mother breaking into her son's house, bringing a ladder fromm across town to boot? Not to mention that it is just ridiculous to think that she could lift him up. And not even wake him up. My husband and I thought maybe she drugged him. There are so many sweet books about the love between parents and children. But this is just creepy and weird."
5,i cry just reading these reviews!,"This such a great little book. I have only one daughter, and she is 15 now, but we remember reading this book, and we both cry. I cant get through this book without tearing up. Buy this book and read it with your children.....you will have a memory forever."
4,Thoughts of love you forever,"""Love you forever"" is a children's classic that people either love or hate. Some consider it a masterpiece of a mother's eternal love for her children. Others consider it a sick tale filled with oidepus (Spelling?) overtones. I feel somewhere inbetween, but everybody has thier own opinion."
1,"""Creepy"" book!","I have 2 young kids who I love dearly, and I LOVE reading to them. HOWEVER...this is a very warped book. The mother ""creeping"" into her son's room creeps me out! If I could give it negative stars, I would. We received it as a baby shower gift, and the only other times I've had it out have been to read it to others and laugh at how ridiculous it is."
5,The best!!,"Without a doubt, one of the finest children's books ever written! It was one of our soon-to-be 16 year old grandaughter's favorites during storytime in the evening before she went to sleep."
5,Frank Tibbetts,"The cycle of life as it should be. This is one of the most beautiful stories that I have ever read. Nicely written and beautifully illustrated. I have read this book many times and am proud to include it in my library. On a personal note, I lost a child at birth and this book immediately came to mind. This book is with him, along with my heart, until the end of time. Thank you for writing this book Mr. Munsch."
5,children,"This book is a must have, if you read to children on a daily basis! Great for Parents and Child Care Providers!"
5,I found book heartwarming,"I remember having this book read in my Older Adults class and found it very heart-warming. It never once dawned on me that it was inappropriate or creepy. I was so disappointed to read some of the comments made by the other readers who thought it was so ""creepy"". The ""Well-Adjusted Mom,"" was so insensitive to say that she would not have it read at someones funeral after one of the readers said she had in read at her son's. I understand that everyone has their own opinions, but at least be sensitive to someone else's personal tragedy that found this book comforting in times of sorrow. I would recommend this book to anyone...young and old. It is about a parents love for their children."
1,Creepy Book!!! What where they thinking!,"I got this book as a baby shower gift. When my husband and I read it we didn't know what to think. Number one: I hope I am NEVER this mom in the book. Number 2: My son would have a restraining order on me if I ever behaved in this way. Number 3: It is just a dumb story!! Do not buy this book. There are MILLIONS of great children books and THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. If you want to play a practical joke on someone then give them this book and act serious. Although it might ruin your friendship it will be one funny joke! Sorry to be a downer, but this book is awful, very creepy and disturbing."
5,The best Mother and Son book,This is such a special children's book about a mother's relationship with her son and a son's relationship with his mother. So sweet.
5,Best book ever,I used to read this book to my daughters when they were little and now ordered this book for all of my grandchildren.
5,Mom loved it,Use to read this to my mom when I was a kid. Thought it was a great gift idea for her birthday. She loved it
5,Love You Forever,"Love You Forever (Gift Edition)Beautiful rendition of a mothers'love for her child and a childs'love for his mother.One of my favorite books of all time.It was recommended to me by a salesperson at a book store in Grass Valley, California. She thought since I had two young sons, we would enjoy it. And we certainly have for many years.I give this as a gift to new parents of sons."
1,Hate to have to give it even one star...,"Maybe a million Elvis fans can't be wrong but a million ""Love You Forever"" fans certainly can be....disturbing parts in this story, spend your $10 on a myriad of better childrens books..."
1,Little obsessive are we?,"Let me ask you a couple of things:1.How would you feel about your mother sneaking into your room on her hands and knees and watching you sleep and then cuddling you like a baby when you are a teenager? ""My mom gives me reassuring hugs"" - ok. ""My mom rocks me to sleep and sneaks into my room"" - wimpy and creepy2. You are about 25 yrs old. Do you think it's normal for your mother to drive out to your house with a ladder, sneak into your room via burglar style, stare at you and continue to rock you to sleep? There must've been a reason for you moving out of your house in the first place right? So she is coming back every night and has to climb through the window as opposed to the door because....why?3. Aren't there less-obsessive ways to show your kids you love them rather than scaring them into thinking you will always be there - ALWAYS.....no matter what? Why not just tell your kids ""You can run.....but you can't hide....*evil-mom smile*""Enough said."
1,The sentiment is right...,"but the implementation is creepy. By all means, love your children their whole lives. But please tell me you don't sneak into their rooms when they grow up and rock them in their sleep. If you don't see anything creepy about that, then I am truly scared."
5,A very moving book,I first encountered this little gem as a bookseller and handsold it countless people. I gave it as Mother's Day gifts to my mother and mother-in-law. I don't have children of my own but it absolutely makes me bawl every time I read it. I had to get out a tissue just reading these reviews! It truly enforces the idea that a child learns to love others unconditionally when he is raised in a home where he himself receives unconditional love. As I get older I realize that someday I will be able to give back some of that love by caring for my parents. It's absolutely a perfect gift for anyone with children or aging parents or both.
2,Over the Top Weird,"We received this book as a gift and my husband and daughter think its an ok book, so I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Personally I try to avoid reading it and find it creepy! The mother in the story only expresses her love while her child is asleep. I understand the message of the story is unconditional love and the son is aware of and moved by his mothers actions. But the book still seems to show a bizarre way to express love even if its only meant to be allegorical."
1,Can you say...CREEPY???,"As others have said, it is a very unhealthy way to portray unconditional love. The little song is cute, for a small child...but sorry, if my mom drove across town in the night and snuck in my window to rock me...I would have her committed! The end where the grown man then holds his sick mom...touching, but depressing for a child to think about.There are great books out there for children...this is not one of them."
1,"""Love"" you forever?","I read the book years ago, and I've read a number of the reviews, both pro and con.Mother is crawling across the floor of the son's room from the time he is about nine. Why? And she keeps doing it!So let's pretend that it's a father and daughter. He crawls across the floor of his nine year old daughter's room and picks her up... And keeps doing this until she is living across town, and then he brings a ladder.It creeps me out no matter which parent does it, but you can see why the author (a male) had to write from the mother's viewpoint.*shudder*"
5,"20 years later, I'll read it again",For many years I read this book to my son. He is getting married this year and I plan to read it at the rehearsal dinner and give it to his bride letting her know it is so comforting to me that she will be his wife and love him forever!
5,Made me cry,"I read this book to my twins when I first got it, and it was so beautiful that I actually teared up and had to hold back from crying out loud. A beautiful sentiment! A must for all mommies!"
3,Everyone else loves this a lot more than I do.,"Robert Munsch, <strong>Love You Forever</strong> (Firefly Books, 1995)This is one of those kidlit classics that pretty much everyone who has ever had young children seems to have on their shelves, that pretty much everyone in the entire world has read, etc. I somehow managed to avoid it until, as what seems a matter of course, my wife ordered a copy when we had a baby. And so, after all this time, I finally got round to reading it. And as much as I hate to say it, I really don't feel the love. I mean, it's a decent enough book, not at all badly written (though it seems to lack some spark; I haven't sat down and analyzed it, but I think my main problem was with the rhythm of the language), but as is often the case when I sit down and read something it seems like the entire rest of the world raves about, I found myself wondering where the fire was when I finally got through all the smoke. ***"
3,Love You Forever by Robert Munsch,"I would recommend this book to parents and children that need some reminders of how important they are to each other. Some people don't realize how much they love someone or how important they are in their lives until they are gone. I think that this book can be appropriate for all ages young and old because everyone could get a different meaning from reading this book. This book reminds me of Yay, You!: Moving Out, Moving Up, Moving On by Sandra Boynton. It reminds me of this book because of the message of moving on with your life and taking each experience one step at a time. It also reminds people to celebrate success and remember to support others."
4,Unconditional Love,"Do you know how much your parents love you? Now that I am a parent, I can understand a little more about parents' unconditional love toward their children. If you have never read Love You Forever by Robert Munsch, you must read it!I recommend it to any child who doubt, if at all, their parents' love. You may want to read it if you want to remind yourself of their love. Now, if you are a parent who is burnt out by your ever-changing children, reward yourself by reading this book.This is one of the books that will bring tears to your eyes. Another book I would recommend is The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn. This is a book about sending your child to school for the first time. You'll love this book if you liked Love You Forever!"
4,Reviewing I Love You Forever by Robert Munsch,"I thought this book was great to teach children about loss and the love of a mother to her child and I would recommend it to teachers. It seemed to conjure up deep emotions from many of its readers and listeners due to the sensitive subject of death. The content is good for third grade and up, however, second grade might be able to grasp the concept of loss. I Love You Forever is definitely NOT for kinder and first. I would compare this book to My Friend Rusty. This book is also about the loss of life except it deals with losing a friend rather than a mother. Make sure you have a box of tissue when you read this one!!!"
1,yikes!,"Ok, i'm as sentimental as the next mother, but come on! This story starts off very sweet and becomes downright creepy half way through. Really odd book and the illustrations are awful. I won't be reading this to my son."
1,Wonderful song - but sick behavior.,"I don't get it. While I do understand the love for the song -- the ""I'll love you forever, like you for always"" sentiment, I was appalled the first time I saw the book. It appeared to me the mother was practically ""stalking"" her son. Crawling around on the floor to peer at him at night, driving by his house, then climbing a window into her grown son's bedroom. I thought that, rather than protraying the healthy kind of forever love any mother has for her child, it portrayed a desperate, sick, possessive sort of love. This mother's bizarre behavior gives me the creeps."
1,Shockingly BAD!!!!!,"I'm so surprised that people find this to be their favorite book!!! I just read it after a long time on the shelf to my 6 year old, having forgotten how awful it was!!!! First of all, a mother doesn't pick up a sleeping baby or toddler because they might wake up. No mother I know would crawl across her TEENAGE BOY'S FLOOR when he's sleeping and pick him up to rock him, nor would she DRIVE to her GROWN SON'S HOUSE in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, climb a LADDER to climb through his window and rock the grown man while he is sleeping! Sick and weird!!! It is some crazy codependent relationship. There are plenty of books that express the beautiful unconditional love of a parent for a child, and this is not one of them. I am always the first to cry and sentiment and sap, but this one made me feel physically ill. Blech."
1,Creeeeeeeepy,"Ok, this is not touching. It's creepy. It's parental stalking. If one more weirdo gives us one more copy I'll lose my mind. And you know they ALWAYS have to inscribe it so I can't even return it."
1,Hate to be another party pooper but...,"This book is absolutely horrible for children! It's right up there with The Giving Tree in terms of giving kids a warped view of what real life and realtionships should be about. Nevermind that even the angles of the illustrations promote a feeling of sneakiness, nevermind that the mother's face is half hidden behind the bed as she's crouched stalking her sleeping child. Nevermind the fact that this woman is driving across town at midnight to break into her adult son's house and ordering him to come see him because she's old and sick... Not once, the entire time he's growing up, does she express this (obsessive) love she has for him during the day when he can be a part of it. That, I think, says it all. This is a book of pure nostalgia and it is meant for adults. By reading it to children you put the burden of love and codependence on them. That's not fair."
1,Creepy,"Sorry, but I just can't see how you can't find this book strange. I agree that it does express the attachment a mother has to her child but this goes overboard. Driving across town in the middle of the night, climbing up a ladder and into her sons bedroom reminded me of something out of Psycho or at the very least Serial Mom. What would you do if your mother did this?"
1,"A true Classic for our distorted age, indeed!","My, how I was drawn-in to this lovely story about mutual love between a son and his mother. When I finished it, I thought, ""There is something weird about this book, what is it?"" I think many readers agree the sneaking-in-with-the-ladder is a bit much. It's just too surreal for me. Yes the sentiments are real and deep, but surely there was a better way to show this. Of course it speaks to the generation where two-parent families (mom and dad, male and female for further clarification) are a disappearing breed. No doubt many single moms (widowed, divorced, or single) would find great empathy with this. It is a touching story, but it seems to stress the finality of death a bit too existentially for me. As a high school physics and latin teacher, whose worldview has been largely fashioned by the classics and historic Christianity, I would never read this to my child. I guess I'm just too old school. ..."
5,Heartwarming Story!,"This is a great book, one that you will read aloud over and over to your children (hopefully while you are rocking them!) It is timeless, and crosses all generations. I highly recommend it as a gift to all expectant and new parents!"
2,Boring!,"This book is neither entertaining, nor fun, but a sentimental pile ($*&!. Don't waste your time. I hate reading it to my kids.I also hate the cover, because I sends the message that no matter what your kids do we will always love them. Not that I won't but I don't want to encourage bad behavior like flushing watches down the toilet."
1,"Creepy, creepy, creepy!","I thought perhaps it was just me, but I can see from other reviews that many people agree: this book is disturbing. It portrays a stalking, dysfunctional relationship, and frankly, it kind of makes my skin crawl. Perhaps the people who think it is poignant or sweet are not paying very close attention when they read it. With so many other wonderful books out there that express the mother/child relationship, the cycle of life and death, and the idea of unconditional love, I cannot understand why anyone would purchase this or even borrow it from the library."
1,extremely disturbing,I just had to throw this book in the trash. I don't think it should be read to any child. It glorifies breaking and entering and intruding upon your child as an adult. It's just disturbing.
1,WARNING: not for every child,"While I agree that the sentiment is beautiful, I don't think all children (or all adults) would enjoy the experience. However, I do think it could be good for a child whose parent is suffering a terminal illness."
5,Special to Me,"This book is special to me because it makes my mom cry, which is no easy feat. My mom is a very emotionally cautious, tough individual, and to see her let down her guard and openly weep when reading this shows me just how much she relates to the mother in this story who overcomes all obstacles (physically and emotionally) to be there for her child always to comfort him, and then to have that child return her unending love for him. My mom cannot even look at the cover of this book in stores or at home. Writing this review even makes me cry. It's a very touching story. I don't even think I could read this to my own daughter without crying. It makes you feel like there's nothing better than to have the reciprocal love of a parent/child."
2,Not For Grandparents,"The title caught my eye as I was searching for books to read to my grandchildren. I did not find the story appropriate for grandparents to read to their grandchildren as it is a story from a mother to a son. The end alludes to the mother dying too, which I didn't want to read to small children. I gave it to my 34 year old son to let him know how much I loved him. It was something of a substitute for a greeting card."
1,creepy metaphor,"This book is a little creepy. While I understand it's just supposed to be a metaphor, it's a creepy metaphor. Sneaking into a teenager's room (or even a 9 yr old) and picking them up and rocking them!?? Then doing it to an adult?! Funny in a way, but I find it creepy. The beginning and end are fine, and even touching, but the middle bit--yikes!"
1,A good laugh,"This book chugs along at a decent clip, but becomes more disturbing with every page. I kind of knew it was coming, but when I turned the page and saw A GROWN MAN IN HIS MOTHER'S LAP, I had such a fit of giggles, I almost fell off of the bed. Seriously: this woman drives across town, with a ladder on her truck, to creep up the side of her son's house and into his room??? He is a grown man and she is holding him in her lap? (oedipal aside: excuse me while I gouge out my own eyes) This is not a healthy image of love or parental boundaries."
1,One of the worst I've seen yet !,"This is a book about dysfunction and a mother's inability to let go appropriately of her child. When mother continues her serenading of the sleeping son, even into adulthood by going to his house and sneaking in the window with the ladder tied to the top of her pickup truck,....well, I just couldn't take anymore. This is not a book my child will see because the values expressed therein should not be admired or perpetuated. Even the lullaby itself is limited. Why? Because a mother's true love continues even after her death - in spirit! And why cause a child to think about mom's love ending with her death? Why cause a child to think about mom's death at all? This is simply a terrible book in all aspects."
1,Have NOT received my order yet!!,"I wish I could say my review was good, but today is Jan. 16, 2011 and I still haven't gotten my order!!!! :("
1,inaccurate product description,"this product was supposed to be in ""good"" shape. but it wasn't. every single page was creased. one so badly you can barely see the picture. this should have been in the description. i will not buy from this seller ever again."
2,Love You Forever,I contacted the seller telling him/her that it should be noted when there is a personal inscription inside the front cover. This book was described as like new in pristine condition. I never got a response. Otherwise the book came in a timely manner but it wasn't packaged in a bubble wrap envelope for protection.
2,"Didn't Love ""Love You Forever""","Okay, I admit it--the first time I read this book I teared up, but the emotion didn't remain in further readings. The mother's picking up a grown man is improbable and unnecessary to the story and the pictures are crude. The author had a good idea, but somehow it didn't work for me."
2,A Dark Tale of Co-dependency and Incest,"This book is full of dark symbolism. It is about a mother who sneaks into her little boys room to watch him go through puberty while he sleeps. She sometimes picks him up and sings to him. When he is an adult, we see that he sleeps in a single bed, meaning he never got married. Soon afterwards mom comes and pays a late night visit...she uses a ladder to crawl into his room. Shortly thereafter you see the son with a baby, but no wife, yep mother and son have produced an offspring????Later, after mother ages quite a bit, we see a strange picture where the son is cradling her next to his breast singing that sinister lullaby.Very campy stuff!!!"
4,Love You Forever,"This is a full color volume which tells a story from early childhoodto manhood from the perspectives of mother and child. Each pagedepicts the child evolving into adulthood. Initially, the child is cuddled by the mother. Later in life, there is a bit of arole reversal which is extraneous. The story progresses very muchlike a parable. It is perfect reading for a parent to a small child.The pictures make the language itself come alive.The work could be used to help young children read the Englishlanguage through the portal of both words and pictures. Theacquisition would make a perfect gift for the young child inyour family. It is large in size with big print. This is another important advantage for both parents and their children. The priceis reasonable for budgetary purposes."
3,Entertaining but...,"...no, he doesn't know much about the history. Yes, he did do some homework on the subject, but this was more about its entertainment value and is home-movie quality at best. There are some awkward moments as he tries to ""interview"" some of the locals. And some of the things he says about what he is observing is just plain incorrect. But if you're in the mood to watch Brian be funny for about a half hour, then by all means pick this up..."
5,An new spaniard Genius,"Second movie from the spaniard director Alejandro Amenabar, that this time amazes us with his creativeness, by constructing a film that moves from a romantic drama to a thriller and ends in an enigmatic sci-fi story. The movie is all on the dreams --rather say nightmares-- of young wealthy and attractive man, that never knows if what he's livng is true or is just a dream. The dreams are in this case the actions of the movie, the plot constantly moves from what he is supposed to dream to what we believe is real. So in the end we never really know if what we saw really happened or was a figment of our imagination. An advice when you watch this movie, ""Open your Eyes""."
5,A GEM!!!,"I was never that much into movies, but this one REALLY GOT TO ME. Ignore the comparisons, they are ALL TOO UNFAIR. ""Abre los ojos"" has definitely created a class of its own. I'm writing this because no review I've read as of yet has mentioned that this film really means something different to every viewer, to every audience also. Yes, there's a love story, there's thrill, there's science fiction, but what makes this film special is that all the sequences are presented in a way that allows you to piece-up your own story and conclusion, and that really makes it a ""MUST-HAVE"". I rate this a ""5-Star Movie"" because it's NOT TRENDY, and it's so good that while you're watching it you don't even think about Penélope Cruz or Eduardo Noriega, you're looking at Sofía and César. It's almost 2hrs long, but I wish it would have been five times that. ""ABRE LOS OJOS"" has moved me to start a DVD collection with it! ;-)"
1,"Nice try, bad film.","This movie is too ambitious, tries to say too much but with lack of real substance. The script seems to have been written by a teenager, raised by MTV culture. Certainly, Amenabar was very amused by his abilities as a writer, but only people with very little intelligence may find this film amusing."
3,More Lucid than Vanilla Sky version,"Like other viewers, I had watched Vanilla Sky first and was intrigued enough to see the original Spanish production. The story line is easier to follow than Vanilla Sky. While the two versions are very similar, it's worth getting Open Your Eyes if you like the Vanilla Sky story. The movie was a lower budget production and relies more on story telling while Vanilla Sky is a typical slicked-up Hollywood makeover with better sets, music and cinematography. Both have their merits and are recommended."
5,great movie,"I saw this movie in a college spanish class. It's really good and very dark. I liked it so much I went out and bought it. I'm not sure, but I think the woman who plays Nuria, Cesar's ex in this movie, is also the woman who plays Ana in ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle"". After seeing her in this, it was kinda hard to adapt to her completely different character in Arctic Circle."
5,Way better than Vanilla Sky,"Penelope Cruz shows why she was exported to the US in an amazing performance, which is quite different from her portrayal in Vanilla Sky. Though Crowe did write in some touching lines and hilarious one liners, the plot was spoiled and thickened to a beyond point of confusion in the English remake and the clean, sharp and edgy original in Spanish makes for deeper, more interesting characters...Noreiga makes Tom Cruise look foolish, and though Cameron Diaz was a terrifically frightening stalker and Jason Lee was a clever, and quirky best friend...who do you think they learned their roles from? The Spanish actors are superb and a little reading for anyone who doesn't speak Spanish won't hurt for a wonderful film. If you are a fan of the director but don't want to read any subtitles, check out ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman."
1,Awful movie!,"It was one of the worse I've seen, so thought I would help others from going through the same thing I did."
2,My mistake: I read the book first,I feel bad about not liking this movie... Primarily because the book is without a doubt my favourite... My problem with the movie isn't the acting... Its the lack of what was in the book.. I can understand when a book goes to movies there are liberties taken but I feel that to many liberties were taken when David Volez wrote the screenplay... It's just something seemed to be missing. Although Ben Stiller's performance was class A I don't think it was enough to save this movie... Word to the wise... next time to make it accurate especially if it''s fact based...
1,"Very dry, no action.",I kept waiting for some type of action to happen but only seen a whole lot of nothing but a guy using needles. I thought the movie stunk. I paid 17.00 for the DVD anyone out there care to trade?
1,Stinks,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I want to like Ben Stiller, but just can't seem to make it work. Don't waste your time watching this movie - you will just want those two hours back."
2,Too Dark,"Weak plot. Too dark. Feels too disjointed. What is the story trying to tell? Yes, life can be bleak but this is overboard. A pointless life is not entertaining. Watching a self-centered wretch indulge his impulses isn't interesting without showing how he mustered the resolve to change. Great cast but a disappointing movie and somewhat boring. Don't waste your time."
5,Very Original,"One of my favorite movies. When I first watched it, I was left jaw-dropped. Very original idea. Hollywood remade it as ""Vanilla Sky"" with Tom Cruise, but I've never seen the remake as I'm afraid it will bastardize the original. You also get to see Penelope Cruz's hot body and tits, which is of course a plus."
4,Do you Like Twists,"I love films with twists, but hate those that build you up and then dont deliver. This film delivers ! It builds the pace and interest, gives you clues and makes you think. Well acted and the final conclusion and twist comes out 10 mins from the end but your still not sure if this is the truth or not and keep watching ...... excellent , so much so Tom Cruise bought the rights to it having seen it , lets hope the hollywood remake Vanilla Sky does it justice."
4,"Interesting, slow, depressing","Based on the autobiography of Jerry Stahl who is playhed by a very subdued Ben Stiller(no humour here). The cast is rounded off by owen Wilson and Genine Gerafalo as well as Elizabeth Hurley. It is essentially a movie about a writer who goes from small town nobody to big stardom writing for Alf and other 1980s comedy shows, but his downfall comes through heroin addiction. This is mostly a chronicle of this downfall, his shakes and endless search for another hit. It is tragic but eventually the viewer stops caring, his life is not so interesting and it is not that compelling a story. It is mostly just depressing, wathcing Stahl be arrested while driving high with his child in the seat next to him.Not that great a film, but a true breakthrough role for Stiller.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Disappointing,"I normally prefer the European originals to their dumbed-down Hollywood remakes, but I think many viewers coming to this film via Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" will be disappointed. So faithful was Crowe's adaptation that, when watching this one, it's hard not to notice the things he changed and to come away with the feeling that they were changed for the better. The dialogue and scene structures are much looser here, and the backstory isn't as well developed. And in terms of performances and production values, ""Vanilla Sky"" leaves ""Open Your Eyes"" for dead. Full credit to Alejandro Amenábar for the originality of his story and his vision, but hats off to Crowe for taking it to the next level. I'm stunned."
4,A Fascinating Movie Eclipsed by Vanilla Sky,"Open Your Eyes is a very, very good Spanish film that was the basis of Vanilla Sky. This is one of the few instances, however, that an American remake is as good or better than the foregin film it is based on. Vanilla Sky is substantially longer than Open Your Eyes, and includes almost all of the scenes of the Spanish movie plus a lot of added material that really adds to the film. If, like me, you don't speak Spanish you'll find it hard to read all the subtitles in Open Your Eyes and still have enough time to watch the actors. Still, how many science fiction movies do we get these days that contain an original idea, let alone aren't just a shoot-em-up in space? If you loved Vanilla Sky you'll want to see Open Your Eyes as well."
2,Bad movie...,This movie wasn't worth the time watching it... It wasn't entertaining nor was it educational...
4,Drug Addict,"Ben Stiller plays a writer who dabbles in drugs and becomes addicted..His writing begins to suffer and he heads into full blown drug addiction...He does drugs(Heroin)anywhere, anytime..He even takes his baby with him to get drugs..His writing begins to suffer and he heads into full blown drug addiction...Using Crack as well.."
5,"An original, superior foreign thriller","Words cannot describe the quiet intensity of this film; the original style it creates while at the same time skillfully weaving elements from other influences; the haunting quality of the lead performances, in particular Penelope Cruz. To give away any of the plot would be borderline criminal, but suffice it to say that this is one of the most intelligent and twisty thrillers to come from Europe in the past decade. I am curious about - but not quite anticipating - the Cameron Crowe remake starring Tom Cruise in the Eduardo Noriega role, Cameron Diaz as the ""femme fatale,"" and Penelope Cruz reprising her role. If anything, it will be facinating to see the touches that such a personal filmmaker as Crowe brings to the story, and if exposing such a film to the United States mainstream will be a success or not."
5,Very good (Bien escrito y hecho),"I saw _Vanilla Sky_ first, but it did not cloud my judgment on ABRE LOS OJOS. What a great film: metaphysics and psychology in a mesmerizing thriller.I cannot recommend this strongly enough.Vi _Vanilla Sky_ antes de ver ABRE LOS OJOS, pero eso no me confundió en cuál fue la mejor película: ABRE LOS OJOS.Es tan buena película, mezclando la metafísica y la psicología en un film lleno de intriga.La recomiendo mucho."
3,Not a bad film,"I got this because I am big fan of ""Vanilla Sky."" The plot line and even the dialog is very close. The climax of ""Vanila Sky"" was much better and it also better conveyed the sense of dis-jointedness of a bad dream. I'm glad I bought this video but if I had to choose between the two I would choose ""Vanilla Sky"" every time."
5,great mind juggler,"If you can follow subtitles along with movie, you'll like this one much more than vanilla sky. However, vanilla sky answered some questions for me or perhaps just that I knew what to expect."
5,Permanent Classic,"This movie is an excellent addition to my collection. Ben Stiller shows how good of an actor he really is. I've never seen him portray a character such as the one in this movie. Elizabeth Hurley looks hot as always. Whether you like independent films or not, you'll like this one."
1,Disappointment,"After reading all the rave reviews of this film, I was severely disappointed by the anti-climactic reality of it. Part of my disappointment, no doubt, hinges on my expectations - I was expecting a clever twist-thriller similar to The Usual Suspects. Rather, it was more like a science fiction film, borrowing heavily in plot devices and scenes from Total Recall (a great film - just not what I was expecting) - derivative and lacking in originality and cleverness."
2,Teen's Review,"I didn't like this book so much because American Girl has a tactful way of wording things. You'd think this is a good thing, but it's really not, becuase most of the book suggests being a good friend, but what if your friend is the one that's complicating things? If you have a specific relationship with a friend that's not working out, this book will help you out somewhat, but won't answer your specific concerns."
2,Bad Condition,"The content was good, but the book itself was in terrible condition. I will never buy used again and I don't recommend it to anyone!As for the content...It was common sense stuff, at a very low reading level. The letters from other girls with similar problems were great to have. I gave this to my 12 year old, and she read the whose thing in a couple of hours. She said there were a few things in it that she liked. Overall a good thong to have, better for a fourth or fifth grader than a middle school student."
1,Review of Great Room Fireplaces: Collection A104,"I've purchased 3 books from Amazon about fireplaces, since my wife and I are building a new home with a masonry fireplace in the family room. This book is a departure from the other books (such as ""Fireplace and Mantel Designs"") that contained real-life, color pictures of fireplaces someone would build in their home. Instead, this book contains only fireplace sketches -- no color pictures or descriptive text. These sketches are of fireplaces that would likely be placed in a fictional storybook castle moreso than a home. We would not recommend this book for people looking for ideas on a fireplace for their home."
5,Awesome!,"Totally awesome music! Super eclectic mix. Great for rocking out or just relaxing. Awesome, awesome, awesome!Will definitely recommend it to my friends."
3,pretty good product,"does what it's supposed to but a few minor issues. a toddler can get easily frustrated when it's not doing what it's supposed to. if the book isn't inserted correctly or the page isn't lined up just right, then pen pushes give the wrong noises. of course i know that this is a learning process, but getting your child to learn how to use a pen along with making sure that everything is lined up right can be frustrating. also, kids carry things by whatever is convenient. sure there's the handle on this, but my daughter oftentimes carries the unit by the pen- and now the wire for the pen is about to give out. i searched ebay and see that there are replacement pens available, but that proves my point that my daughter isn't the only one to mess up the pen mechanism. HOWEVER, my daughter loves it and we're now trying to track down a new pen so that our son can inheirit the unit for his next stage."
3,broken,"I got this iron for Christmas of 04. It worked great, when it was working. It quit heating up in September of '05, lasting not even a year. Tried to find the manufacturer online to see if they would replace it, but no luck so far."
2,Curling Iron,"I returned this item the other day. I have very long, straight hair. I needed a large barrel for the curl but this item did not work properly. At the hairdresser usually a 2"" barrel is used. This particular product had settings however even the lowest setting cringed my hair, and I could not achieve an even curl. I really was disappointed with it."
5,Good Homeschooling Resource,"I'm a homeschooling mother of two. This book is very affordable and well worth the effort. It is not a complete curriculum it covers language skills and mathematics. The exercises are a lot of fun, the explanations are clear it is indeed comprehensive with regards to language skills.This book does not claim to be a complete curriculum it claims to comprehensive and it is. But for areas such as biology, social studies and so forth you would need to get additional resources.My kids have grown up on these books and I highly recommend it."
3,I wish it were organized differently.,"This is a nice work book to supplement my second graders online curriculum, but I wish it were organized like my six graders book of the same title.The second grade version (at least the one I received, which has a different cover as the one I ordered - same title) is organized by a daily work guideline rather than subjects. For example, the second grade book will have math, language, reading, etc, in the first couple of pages, and then repeat another group of daily subjects. There are, however, some nice unit type studies. My six graders workbook of this title is grouped according to subject. Math is in a group, reading comprehension in a section, grammar, etc. That is a more logical way to organize a book of this size.I will be using this 2nd grade book, but it requires more work on me to find the right material to give her on any given day than it would have had it been organized by subject."
5,"Lyrical, soothing to the soul","Any fan of Celtic music must buy this CD. The soothing yet sprightly harp artistry contained here is perfect for relaxation or inspiration--I listen to it while writing fiction, and find it perfect for stimulating my imagination and creativity. The musicianship is excellent; the tone of the harps sweet, and the melodies are alternately rollicking and thoughtful. If you like Celtic music, classical harp, or even classical guitar, this music is a must."
1,"Thought I was getting a whole show,","not 22 minute of 2 episodes, ripped!!! Truly ripped. I loved the Flip Wilson show one, because he didn't get into the same things that some of the previous black shows that ended penniless and drug addicts and mainly broke!!!!"
1,The Art of Breathing,"Some of the illustraions are informative to someone just learning about the consciousness of breath.I find it not very informative or helpful. Considering the high price of the video,I would search elsewhere."
5,Breathing is important,"Breathing is important and this dvd goes through step by step with visualizations to help properly breathe. I had the vcr version (which came with a book to reference to) which was very helpful. My vcr hit the dust so upgraded to dvd version, which does not have the book. Luckily I have the one from the vcr version."
1,Lessons in Breathing,"I am totally disappointed with this book and DVD. It is not what I expected especially based on the amount I paid for both. The Author does not give me anything that I could use for my breathing concerns, and the DVD is not well done."
2,"Cheap product, cheaper quality","I bought this to use with a 170-500 f5.0-6.3 sigma with my D80/D300 Nikons. Even though I new that I was buying a cheap product, I didn't know that this would be so bad.... Even with clear Southern California skies, I couldn't get a reasonable picture..."
2,Kenko 2x Teleconverter,highly disappointed with the Kenko teleconverter ....i have a nikon d5000 and am using the 2x teleconverter with a 55-200MM lens. The AF does NOT work .... i am going to keep on trying the tricks other reviewers are suggesting but i have my doubts.
1,Bad product!,Only the box looks nice. The nailclipper is of very poor quality - you have to squeeze hard and yet it did not cut the thumb fingernail - my wife ended up using the scissors which also was not an easy task. It is extremely difficult to pull the tools out of the box - and worse - since two of the tools are pointing upwards you can really cut yourself (my wife cut and bled her finger while pushing the file back down in the box). The only thing that seems to work is the file.Do not buy this product.
2,Disappointing,"It sounded good. The back of the case says ""We now have the technology to see inside the heart of a crystal."" Wow. I imagined peeling back layers of lattice work, revealing intricate structures. Want to know what it looks like? Shine a colored light on a crystal or agate, and look at in thru a magnifying glass. That's it. And set it to insipid harp music.I suppose it would be OK if it were the only video of it's kind, but you can do so much better. There are high def fractal zoom videos where you really are going into the heart of it with an explosion of color, rather than the 2 or 3 colors shining on these crystals.A video which succeeds where this one fails is ""Borealis"", which uses lasers shone thru crystals, and set to the music of Steve Roach.Or Google ""cinemandala"", an AMAZING kaleidoscopic video I also purchased."
4,solid running shoe,"I have worn many running shoes from several companies, and have stuck with Brooks for the past several years. Running long distances in order to train for marathons, I find this shoe to be lightweight with excellent cushioning, even after 300 miles. This is an excellent price from Amazon, and highly recommended."
4,Great book for modest needs,"This bilingual dictionary's two greatest virtues are its compact yet readable format and its affordable price. As a bonus, there are brief lists of common words and phrases at the front and back. And, to make it useful in the field, this readily fits many pockets. Best, its plastic slipcover will protect it when your pocket turns sweaty, as it so often will in the countries where Portuguese predominates. This meets my limited needs, as someone who comes across the occasional Portuguese word in passing. Many high school language students will also find that it has all the vocabulary they need. This isn't a scholar's reference, though. Translated definitions tend towards the terse, so they won't cover all usages of a term. It offers plenty if you don't need much, and that's good enough for me right now.//wiredweird"
4,Good Enough Portuguese-English Dictionary,"I bought this dictionary to help me in my Portuguese short course before I travel as well as to use on the trip. So far it has had an entry for everything I looked for but, obviously, there was no practical way to see if it has all the words I will ever need. I wish it had been published on thinner paper so that the entire book would fit better in a pocket. I have a German-English and a Spanish-English that are smaller and thinner. There is no reasonable way to know if they contain the vocabulary this one does. However, this is small enough and will be OK if I carry it in my camera bag or have cargo pants with fatter pockets. Overall I recommend the book."
3,It'll work in a pinch.,"If you need to find a common word, this is fine (as long as you can read small print!!). If you are looking for a more exhaustive dictionary (Port-Eng), you will be frustrated with this one."
4,Exactly what you want in a pocket dictionary,"This is a no-frills, perfectly sized pocket dictionary to use as a supplement for beginner classes or for quick on-the-go reference while traveling. It has most words you'll need, fits into purses/bags easily and comes in handy when you don't have access to the Internet/Google translate and need to figure out how to explain something. It doesn't have definitions, just translations of words, which is good but beware that there are often subtleties that can't be conveyed in this format, or words that have multiple meanings in different contexts which aren't explained. If you're really looking to learn the language you should not use this as your only reference."
3,Good quick reference,The student who I ordered this for was disappointed at the lack of quantity of words in the dictionary. It didn't contain many of the words she was looking up.
2,Disappointed,"The print is very small, and difficult to see without magnification and bright light. I just spend 2 months in Portugal and most Portugese words I tried to look up were not listed. Not much help for grocery, restaurants."
2,Need a Magnifying Glass!!!,"Was very disappointed that I could not read the tiny (6 point) type in this book, even though I have great eyesight. The description, ""Large Print"" implies that the type is large, but this is misleading, to say the least. Who wrote this description??? Will return this item."
5,Huate Cusine: Scot's Tradition,"A glorious unveiling of the foundations, history, and trends in Scottish hospitality. Several centuries of provisioning, lardering, cooking and putting to table the staples and sweeties of the Scots. Amply footnoted, historically referenced, culturally defined understandable writing. The pages ooze with atmosphere and one may find themselves reading with a distinct ""brough"". Really a fine work and clean printing of recipies and history. A must for any modern Scot's, or Irishman's kitchen (careful how you use that word) library."
4,Great book for kids learning about earthquakes and volcanoes,"I am a librarian and I love giving kids this book to use for their experiments. The experiments explain volcanoes and earthquakes in a way that is easy for them to understand. As in all experiment books, some experiment need some adult help while others require household items. The only difficulty I had with this book was the listing of the objects needed to make the experiment. They are listed awkwardly and you need to read the list carefully. (if this kink was worked out, I would have given the book 5 stars! )"
5,"Geat, relaxing CD that any New Age fan will like.","Harmony: Elements of Balance is a relaxing and soothing CD. With titles by SonicAmbrience, it make it a CD that all New Age listeners will like. ""Life is Frantic. The dizzying combination of stimuli in our daily lives can leave us feeling out of balance. Fortunately, music can alter our state of mind and relax our bodies in a very nurturing way. The subtle effect of a melody's interplay with rhythm creates an element of balance in an unbalanced world...."" -back of CD."
5,Great action and adventure novel,"I love Jack DuBrul and wish he would write some more new books. I know he is now writing with Clive Cussler but he needs to get back to doing his own thing too. This one was a page turner as are all his Mercer books. Couldn't put it down, and it was a long one for sure. Suspense all the way to the end, sometimes a little over the top with Mercer's ability to get out of impossible situations, but still a great read."
4,"NOT INDIANA JONES-ISH, BUT STILL GOOD---","At times it became more technical than I was interested in, but still a very enjoyable book. Personally, would have liked it to center more on the treasure than the canal."
3,Where's the no-doz,"Boring. This is so drug out, it's hard to keep your eyes open. I have not started a chapter or session in this book to where I haven't dozed off. Drug out story lines, amazing how the people die and don't die!!!!"
4,There's only so many words for this book.,"Read it!As with Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino, there's a new dynamic duo in town, and one of them is older than the sun. (every pun intended) DuBrul does a fantastic job with developing the characters; their depth and frailities, charisma and understanding. The tale weaved, bested by the intense character exposure and interaction. Maybe DrBrul will write a christmas story one day as a follow up. Maybe even a short story. I have a feeling it would be one heckuva party! Medical doctors should beware, however, because there's an 80 year old, chain smoking, hard drinking hero that absolutely steals this book. I give DrBrul a ""thumps up"" for scoffing at the politically correct nonsense that has pervaded the current conscious. Harry - keep drinking, smoking and stabbing bad guys with your cane; it makes for an enjoyable read."
4,A Fun Book,"No adventure fiction book comes close to a book you can believe (like Day of the Jackal) but I think these are better than the Cussler books.Totally implausible, but very entertaining"
5,River of Ruin,Man what a book .I couldn't put it down .Just keep readingreally exciding !!!!!I want more just like it .I have all Clive Clusser's books and looking forward to more and Jack has the same excitement as Clive Thank You
4,Deep Story,I read The Medusa Stone by BuBrul about 4-5 years ago and picked this book up after I was done. It has been sitting on my shelf for a long time and just now got to reading it. I can see why I picked up another book from this author. This story is very deep ans smart. The action is good and the characters are likeable. The downside to this story is the length of the descriptions and the depth at which DuBrul writes. It takes a good while for the story to actually get going. I still would recommend this book but only to those who want a really deep story with heavey descriptions.
4,Top notch action-thriller,"Take a dash of Robert Ludlum, throw in a heaping tablespoon of Clyde Cussler and you have Jack DuBrul's latest techno/spy/thriller, River of Ruin. The action is nonstop and the plot, while far-fetched, is close enough to reality to make you think ""this could actually happen"".One aspect of DuBrul's writing that I appreciate is his attention to detail without getting bogged down in technology or arcane acronymic references. Unlike the many Clancy-clones, DuBrul's works ring with authenticity without reading like an internal memo from the DoD.If Chinese spies, buried treasure, endless intrigue and amazing escapes from death sound like fun to you, get this book!"
2,flimsy,"too flimsy for young children, I cannot allow my grandchildren to handle the book as they will tear it and of course they get upset, they want to turn the pages."
4,Yep those are Zip Ties,"Used these ties to set up my home network, and home theater and they defiantly do the job.+ Multiple colors are good for multiple projects+ It's a lot of zip ties for the price- Package could have used a closure method. A can or a zipper on the bag."
4,Truly useful,This product is truly useful. I checked with several wires belonged to power adapters and other computer products. Before I blew use more than one hard disk or modem. It was a good idea to buy this product and also so cheap.
1,Waste of $. Buy Velco cable ties instead!,Very hard to use as cables are all different sizes and it is hard to get these to stay at right tension. A lot of unnecessary angst and frustration.Velcro ties are much easier to use and control. Velcro ties are also reusable. See Beilkin velcro cable ties. You won't be sorry! I have already thrown out my package of these vinyl ones and have repurchased more of the velcro ties.
1,Defective Products,I purchased a Mio Shape Select from amazon once I received it I realized the light did not work. I sent the item back to amazon and they sent me a replacement. The replacement watch was used and had already been returned from someone else. I returned the second watch. I then tried one more time after they assured me the problems were corrected. The third watch's digital screen was only 1/2 there. The numbers were 1/2 missing. I returned all watches and do not own a Mio shape. I am still awaiting refund for all watches. The first one was purchased over a month ago.
4,A Great Monitor Watch,"This is a great way to monitor your heart rate. I use it 3-5 days a week when I work out. If you are looking for continous monitoring, buy a watch with a chest strap. This is for spot monitoring and does an excellent job at that. My only complaint is that it does not last for many years. I have owned several versions of this watch over the last 5 years. It seems that the watch has a lifespan of about 1 1/2 years. (The batteries last about 7-8 months and are relatively easy to change.) However, with the price of the watch falling over time, I have continued to replace it, as it is excellent and accurate."
4,Good for the money,I ordered this watch to keep myself in my target heart rate while exercising. So far the watch has been great. I have small wrists so it looks a little funny but I can live with it. For the money I spent it was well worth it.
4,Mio Heart watch monitor,Was for Husband and he really liked it and said it works great with his workout routine
1,Damaged Goods,"I have just received my SECOND Shape Watch from amazon that DOES NOT WORK. I am guessing that Mio dumped damaged goods through this website, but I will impatiently wait for yet another. By the time I test this, it will have been close to 6 weeks from start to finish, and that is assuming my watch even works a third time."
2,Not worth the money!,"Heart rate monitor does not work most of the time. It's supposed to give the BPM within 10 secs and I've held onto it for over 1 minute and it doesn't work. I went to the instruction manuel and it says to use moistened finger...that doesn't help either. If you buy, I hope your buy is better than mine. I'd rather have my money back!"
2,Calorie Tracker,The sole purpose of purchasing this product was to determine how many calories I have burned. I can not seem to figure out the calories burned. So this watch is useless to me.
4,Mio Heart monitor,"Did not want to use chest strap, heard this was one of the better ones without, so far so good, easy to use and accurate."
4,Milo Heart Monitor,This watch/heart rate monitor is great and is a lot more convenient than the chest strap type. Good functionality and form. Best one on the market since Casio stopped making their pulse rate watch. Recommended for runners and bikers. I don't use the calorie counter as it requires you to take the booklet with you!
3,Nice sport watch,"I wanted a heart monitor to give me a better idea of my calorie burn. First, the actual calorie burn according to the watch is much less than my treadmill or elliptical, so that is interesting. Second is my only concern with the watch, it doesn't always register heart rate. If I'm running or on the elliptical I really have to slow down or stop to get it done. Then if it doesn't register, it slows me down more so it is frustrating because my heart rate slows down. Also, occasionally it rates low, below resting heart rate. That results in incorrect overall information. I don't use it on my equipment anymore since I know about what the difference is. But it is still useful when I am doing outdoor activities and want the feedback."
5,Great watch with 5 sec reading,"It seems to be pretty accurate and reads my bpm after about 4-5 seconds. I have had to lick my fingers before when too dry.I paid about 39 dollars for it at walm@rt so I am even happier with it lol. I had bought a sport previously and paid $50 for it and it takes about 10 seconds to read.All in all, this has been a good piece and is accurate enough for my HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workouts. You can even get your reading from any screen of the watch. Just hold the buttons and wait."
2,MIO Shape Select....NOT HAPPY!,I bought this thinking it would be great not to have a chest strap during my spin class...the problem is that it is impossible to keep checking my heart rate and then setting it to get an accurate heart/calorie reading. This is NOT a continuous heart rate monitor. I don't know about anyone else but there isn't alot of opportunity to STOP in a spin class!! If you are walking or cleaning house it would work but not for any intense cardio workout. I'm going back to the chest strap!
4,So far so good..,I recently purchased one and it works fine so far..I found some errors (BPM indicates 400 instead of 120) while my work out but it happened less than once a week and not a significant problem for me.
2,Piece of Junk,"I purchased two of these one for my home in PB, AR and one for my home in HS, AR, as I work out in both places. This peice of Junk worked for about a year and just stopped working. Then the other one stopped working in about the same time. I sent one in and they wanted $85 dollars up front to look at and estimate repairs. Now the watch is selling for less than that, go figure. They not only get you on the initial purchase they make more money on your ineviable repair if you are that niave to let them get you twice.Stay away from the MIO (Made in China) There are much better watches out there that will keep on ticking.Cliff"
4,Halston was a genius,"I watched this on demand on Amazon and then purchased it because I love anything about fashion design and designers.This is a thought-provoking and very interesting film about Halston and the 70s when he was the king of couture. I learnedso much about him and fell in love with his clothes.I actually worked around the corner from his shop on Madison Avenue when I was a young woman, but could not afford hisgorgeous Ultrasuede outfits.You will learn about his fabrics and how he cut and designed everything so carefully. He was aman of many virtues like hard working and fastidious and of course a veritable genius. You will also learn about the wilderside of life that was happening back then at Studio 54. Lots of famous models and stars in this movie. Also a look insidehis beautiful home in Manhattan.Highly recommend if you are a fashion afficianado."
2,excessive as ussual,"It arrived just when i was needing it. Malls, shopping, consumerism, no-spaces, junk-spaces, the artificial-scape...finnaly Venturi&Brown met Koolhaas..(as i already suggested) but, despite all these, i still find it hard to pay such a thrilling money just because they didn't take the work of selecting the material. It seems to me lately that information grows endlessly and nobody is paying care to the ""old customed"" thing of selecting, choosing what's really important. IF THE BOOK WERE HALF ITS SIZE IT WOULD BE WORTH. As it is not, i must blame the authors for their happy ""cut and paste and get the money"" editorial strategy. I'm sad to say that i had to read it all and swallow even the most unmature essays to get to this conclusion. I suggest a combined reading of it with ""No Logo"" to get to an ecstasyc state of annoyment and claustrophobia."
3,Not so great for PS3,I bought these cables because I read that the Cat-6 gives a better and faster connection.I tried these out on my ps3 and I was only getting around 6mbps but with my normal Cat 5 cables I was getting 10mbps. I reconnected both cables back and forth for compaison and the Belkin cables were slower each time. I will keep the cable because with my computer I was still getting the same 25 mbps with my previous cat 5 cord.
2,Difficult to unkink,"The way these are packaged, they tend be difficult to straighten and compared to Cables-to-Go, hard to loom and route."
2,Buy someone elses,"Buy another brand of pads. These pads just don't hack it. I used them to wax my boat using a Bosch R/O sander with a soft base pad. Love the sander - hate the buffing pad. The layer that sticks to the sander pad is not adhered to the buffing pad except around the outside perimeter. After a few minutes of use they just roll up in a ball.My wife took the time to hand stich the two layers together at a few points and that helped a lot but it shouldn't be necessary.I also have a PorterCable R/O sander (6"") with pads that really work. I haven't tried any others yet."
2,Alladin's Magic Lamp,This movie was a disappointment. I bought the movie based on the online review of other viewers. This was a mistake. The quality of the DVD movie was very poor. The content was mediocore. Even my 8 year old daughter was not impressed. It definitely was not worth the money I paid for.M.Rahman
1,A Definate rip off,"I didn't like it. My cousin and I watched it and it was a dissapointment. Dont rent it, dont buy it, dont waste your time."
1,"Buy the recently issued version of ""Promised Land"" instead","You can get the same tracks (except for 2 that are found on the 70s set WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES).Buy the recently issued remaster of PROMISED LAND. Only ""I've Got a Thing About You, Baby"" and ""Take Good Care of Her"" are not found on that particular CD."
4,A solid album,"This is actually a pretty good album despite the fact that it was a commercial flop. It only managed to climb to 90 on the US album chart but did manage to make the top 5 on the country album chart in 1974. ""I've Got A Thing About You Baby"" was a top 40 hit while its flip side ""Take Good Care Of Her "" was a top 5 country hit. ""My Boy"" would be released as a single in 1975 and reached the top 20 and went all the way to number 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. My favorite song is the country-rocker, ""Talk About The Good Times"" which I think should have been released as a single. The rockin-Gospel song ""I Got A Feelin' In My Body"" is also very good. All-in-all, a solid effort!"
3,Even Vic Anesini and DSD can`t perform miracles!,"I always loved this album, since it belongs to the Stax Trilogy. Here we get the original Album mixes again and that's the problem. The Mastering by Vic Anesini is almost perfect, no compression and clipping. But some tracks like ""I've Got A Feeling In My Body"" and ""If That Isn`t Love"" sound tiny, Elvis vocals are burried in the mix, they sound like played through a tunnel. Certainley, this release is a improvement over the 90`s release, but the Japanese 24 Bit/ K2 Papersleeve CD has the better soundquality. If you want a CD very close to the original Vinyl Album sounding, than this is the right one for you. Because of the big differences in sound- and performance quality, only 3 Stars."
1,Don't Read This Edition,"I thought I'd be smart. I thought I'd read the Commager abridgement of this work and get the essentials from the history without thousands of pages of needless verbiage or grandiloquence. After about 200 pages I realized the errors of my judgment and bought and read the entire 4 volume set. The reason is simple: If you are going to read Churchill, read Churchill! The unabridged version is much more enjoyable, rewarding, and readable."
5,Beautiful. Bring on their next release.,"A beautiful combination of sax, guitar and familiar melodies. Excellent recording quality. This album would be a great addition to any music collection. I am looking forward to their next release."
5,Golder's Masterpiece- A Wake-up Call to America,"Golder provides an awesome depiction of the social, philosophical, and legal hurdles that today's employees face in an ever-changing work environment. Uncivil Rights is THE definitive text about the true meaning of workplace rights. This book should become the bedside companion to everyone in corporate America- secretary to CEO. This book is a masterpiece of unparalleled form and content. Read Golder's work to enhance! Read Golder's work to enrich! Read Golder's work to enlighten! Uncivil Rights is guaranteed to empower the employee and humble the employer. Uncivil Rights will revolutionize America and make for a more just and civilized society. Thomas Jefferson would surely applaud Professor Golder!"
1,Terrible book,This book is nothing more than a sad attempt to milk money from her dead father in law's name. This is simply a narcissistic woman who left her own children to 'find hersef'. She clearly has not succeeded! She never met John Steinbeck when he was alive. Not in anyway a true glimpse into Steinbeck's prolific life. Don't waste your money.
1,Mean-Spirited Settling of Scores...,"I felt soiled after reading this book, but even beneath Nancy Harper's mean-spirited confabulations, John's intelligence and good heart shine through. Make no mistake, this is not at all John's book, but Nancy's attempt to settle scores with the many people in John's circle toward whom she held grudges, nearly all of whom are women. You might want to pass on this one."
2,boring...very little about John Steinbeck,"I checked this out of the library during one of my research 'attacks'. I was actually researching the life of Ed Ricketts and got dragged back into a Cannery Row-John Steinbeck 'binge'. I thought it would be interesting to read about John Steinbeck through the eyes of a son. However, the is very very little in this book about John Steinbeck and way too much about a weak-minded son. Boring. If you are interested in reading about someone who spends his life trying to find meaning in life via others (ie. cult life) and who cannot find strength within himself....who is too weak to deal with life without chemicals....this may be interesting to you. But there wasn't anything insightful here for me. Be warned...."
3,Just a Sample,"Either the record company wants people to truly embrace metal music, or just wants some money. A whole slew of these compilations came out, with bands like Type O Negative.As with any compilation, the tracks are all great.But is it enough to buy the whole album? For those just getting into the band, maybe, but for fans...there is not a true redeeming factor.Only a few compilations have truly given the best of whatever band it is honoring...this not being one of them.Recommended for those looking for a nice sample of a band's hits."
2,What? Best of?,"From quick look at the tracklist - one cd of songs isn't really enough to show what Sepultura is really about.Yes, the cd is full of Sepultura's commercially aired *hits*, but the real Sepultura isn't just limited to those.It misses some other important Sepultura trademark classics like Mass Hypnosis, Necromancer, Inquisition Symphony, To The Wall, Slaves Of Pain, Escape To The Void, Beneath The Remains, Lobotomy, Primitive Future, Altered State, Warrios Of Death, From The Past Comes The Storms, Kaiowas ect. A double cd wouldn't have been that bad by Roadrunner Records Company (tm).Instead of buying this I recommend that you'd buy the actual albums by Sepultura."
2,LE FALTA CALIDAD DE SONIDO,"NO ES TAN BUENO COMO EL CHAOS AD,EN CALIDAD DE SONIDO,NO SE LE FALTA BRILLO"
2,VHS Tapes,"Arrived well packed, all new tapes. Two (2) of the new tapes drag really bad. Won't buy this brand again."
5,Damn good read!,"Incredible character, engaging story, colorful description, and the straight up wittiest invective. The interview with the author in the back of the book says Americans aren't into this book. Can't imagine why not!"
1,not exact match,"while belt was correct length, it wasn't exact width so belt slips if put in a strain in heavy grass.Had to buy another"
2,"Great, if you are staying downtown ...","Was staying in Ko Olina (S.W. shore), which is not even on the map. Also, decided to travel up to the North Shore, which was not properly covered.Long and short, if you are staying in Honolulu, this map is great, but if you want to go ""walkabout"", it is totally worthless. FWIW, threw it away, and got a map from AAA for free, which had everything I needed (and more!)."
4,shining all night read,buy this book. find a quiet spot. you just might find a world that you didn't previously know or perhaps forgot about.
3,"Lovely & Adorable Story, But Not Very Deep","The prose is textured with a rich sensuality and reads pleasurably. The characters are sweet and quirky. The story is short and to the point. Overall, this book was an entertaining read, but not an earth-shatteringly provocative one. I can't figure out why it means so much to so many people."
4,Simply beautiful,"Banana, a young author, has unconsciously used her innocence and inexperience as a writer to handle the bewilderingly difficult topic of death in a novella and short story, both of which are found in ""Kitchen"".Japanese cuisine is understated, simple and elegant -- much like the novella, which is perfect in its juxtaposition of whimsy and wistfulness. Yoshimoto combines a few ingredients: the death of a grandmother, a lonely girl, a beautiful transsexual, the transsexual's son, hunger (for food and companionship), and the healing love of one person for another. The shorter story that follows sustains the mood of the first and deals with the same themes of death and loss, although it doesn't have the same depth as the first.Kitchen feels like the work of a young author, who is taking her first baby steps into the world of storytelling. I hope she never loses her sense of innocent bewilderment, because that's what made these two stories so wonderful."
2,Childish and not very moving,"There is nothing about this book that doesn't scream with childishness. The writing is horribly immature to the point where excerpts could easily have appeared on a teen girl's facebook stream, no doubt. The plot is simple and the characters do not help one bit.I stopped reading after forcing myself for a bit. I felt my brain slowly turning into jelly and decided to put an end to it."
4,"A beautiful, soul-stirring masterwork","I have read and re-read this book several times, and I am always amazed by its beauty and simplicity. Yoshimoto has to be one of the most empathetic writers of our times: she never creates characters that aren't three-dimensional, fleshed out, and possessed of some secret longing that she renders in stark, intimate detail. She does not humiliate her characters, but shows them the utmost respect, even though the fates she concocts for them may not always be happy ones. The young female narrator of Kitchen is one whose voice will echo in my mind for a long time to come. Funny, touching, beautifully transalted, ""Kitchen"" should be must-reading for anyone interested in the world's great contemporary writers, of whom Banana Yoshimoto is most certainly one."
4,"Great Book, but is there supposed to be a sequel?","I read KITCHEN on a trip to Japan, mostly on the plane, and I thought that it was excellent. The story was incredible, and there were parts that made me feel like I was actually one of the characters in the book. In fact, another girl I traveled with shared the book with me because she was so anxious to read it after I had been telling her about it. When the story ended, it seemed like it wasn't really finished, and there should be another follow up book. I really enjoyed the book except for that fact."
1,Dissapointment...,"I've been told that this is a wonderful book for ages, so, i went and bought it and i can't explain the dissapointment i felt when i read it. The first story is just not good, the last story however is beautiful, but i think that the way Yoshimoto writes, the simple way, doesn't really fit me. It's an okay book to read if you haven't got anything to do or anyother book to read but otherwise i wouldn't and i'm not sure if i am happy about spending the 6.99 for the book, i could've gotten a much better book for that!"
3,"Tragically beautiful, Fresh Voiced, Not For A Sunny Day","I read KITCHEN over the summer, between Commonwealth Literature and Geology classes in Pittsburgh. Haunting, written with a great deal of integrity and above all, a voice that is fresh. Personally, I would read another of Yoshimoto's books, but that has more to do with what I got out of MOONLIGHT SHADOW than KITCHEN. The voice is new, but won't work for everyone. Bordering on sentimentality at times, yet, how does one write truly about death without being sentimental? It does not lack closure, for that would be impossible for Mikage to find, yet, I wanted something more to happen. I don't see the world any differently now than I did before KITCHEN, in spite of its tragic beauty. Don't take this one to the beach."
4,Touching,I somehow stumbled across this book today in B&N and devoured it all within the three hours after I arrived home. I am very familiar with Japanese classics but have never read current Japanese fiction. I was pleasantly surprised!Having lost my parents as a teenager I could relate to Mikage's plight and restlesness to find herself and a place in a world which has left her all alone. I also found myself longing for the experience Satsuki and Urara shared in Moonlight Shadow. What a refreshing read on a day when I miss my parents. I am definitely running to the B&N TOMORROW to stock up on Yoshimoto's other books. How fun to find a new favorite author :-)
4,Transsexual perspective,"My, what a popular book to review! The local bookstore chain threw it on their ""nobody is buying this, lets get rid of it"" shelf, so it must be good. (grin)I am a transsexual, and enjoy that Banana treats TS with respect. She presents sex changing as a way of mourning the loss of a significant female. In a cosmic sense, this may be true, but at a personal level, true causes are far more complex."
4,Better than Amrita,Read the book in about half an hour. It's a bitter sweet tale of loss and friendship. I enjoyed this book much more than Amrita. Banana Yoshmoto is best at creating short scenes that flit from thought to thought which Kitchen does so well.
3,"Liked ""Moonlight Shadow"" better than ""Kitchen""","I didn't find ""Kitchen"" terribly interesting, but I thought the second story ""Moonlight Shadow"" was quite powerful, particularly the latter part describing the apparition."
3,Modern Japan?,"With a loyal following in countries as diverse as Italy, China, Brazil, the US, and her native Japan, Banana Yoshimoto is one of Japan's most well known writers. Kitchen, Yoshimoto's first novel, is the story of Mikage Sakurai, a young woman who has just lost her grandmother, her last living relative, and how she finds a new ""family"" when she is taken in by Yuichi Tanabe and his mother Eriko. The story revolves around Mikage's growing sense of belonging with her new and unusual family, and of the importance she attaches to the kitchen - her favorite place. This short novella explores how the concept of family can transcend traditional definitions. Mikage is accepted by Eriko, the transsexual bar owner (and Yuichi's father). Mikage finds sustenance and comfort in the kitchen, both literally and metaphorically, as she rebuilds her life."
1,Killing Me Softly With Boredom,"I wanted to like this book. At first, the writing was superb. The images were soft and crisp, like newly fallen snow swirling in a snow globe. The two novellas focused on loss and its impact on everyday living -- the heartbreaking feeling of trying to put one foot in front of the other while it feels like you are wearing heavy boots filled with rocks when climbing up a steep hill.I wanted to like this book. The characters were compelling and likable. The emotions expressed were described accurately and poignantly.I wanted to like this book, but alas, I grew weary and it felt like the newly fallen snow became gray and slushy."
4,A Gem!,"I applaud Banana Yoshimoto for this fine piece of work. ""Kitchen"" is a delightful treat filled with humor and irony. She can touch upon the raw emotions of love and lost. I must admit I shed a few tears on her second story in the novel, ""Moonlight Shadow."" The reader has to be in the right mood to really appreciate these stories."
4,"Love, Death, and other warm feelings connected with food.","Banana, while opening to us, her heart, mind, and...stomach, has shown us another emotion. Strength. Strength to go on everday, while the ones closest to us pass away. Strength, in how we deal with it. Whether it be Jogging, cooking, drinking, or even dressing in their clothes, this book is our guide in teaching us to deal with pain. Banana touches us, with a stirring literay style, and characters, that are so much more. They are friends. This is heart felt story telling, of the rare kind"
4,"Cute, touching story -- not great literature though","This was a very enjoyable novel: the protagonist's thoughts and feelings are described with great simplicity and sensitivity, and her romantic travails are ones with which I could identify. It was fun to read, it was touching, it was like a warm conversation with a good friend. It is not great, classic literature, and it did not impact me in any great intellectual way -- but perhaps it was not meant to do so."
3,It was for my book club,Maybe its because we read it so long after the hype but I thought this book seemed like the latest trend in fiction. The setting was fine and the read was still enjoyable but this did not change the way that I see life or offer any big message. It's just sort of sad and a little obsessive.
2,Weird...,"I read this book long time ago, this book reflects a different side of the contemporary Japanese society. Personally, I find this book interesting but weird..."
4,Relaxing and beautiful,I listen to this CD almost every night before bedtime. It's perfect to help whittle away the stresses of the day and help me to not think about tomorrow's stress. The music is peaceful and will help you float into and stay in the present moment.
1,"Good premise, disappointing result","This is a very painful book to read. The concept is excellent, but the author's writing style goes beyond academic. It is pompous, arrogant and, ultimately, laughable. Often I have read a sentence in her book only to think: ""Yes, I read it, but WHAT did she SAY?"" Although I am not a scholar on Mary Queen of Scots, I have read quite a bit about her. In this book, there is a tone that somehow just doesn't ring true. Although I would not recommend this book to anyone, readers who are very serious about Mary Queen of Scots might want to read it merely because it exists."
3,"An Impressive effort, but falls short of its goal","In this book, Lewis sets out to trace the portrayal of Mary Queen of Scots as a romantic figure throughout time. The topic is fascinating, and one I've done minimal research on myself. However, I was disappointed with Lewis's final result. It seems that she bit off more than she could chew with the book, squashing too much information into too little space. For the curious reader, who has not studied Mary Stuart heavily, this book will seem cumbersome and overwhelming; it requires at least a basic knowledge of Mary's life and the events surrounding it. For those who study Mary, either professionally or as a hobby (like myself), will mostly likely get excited when they see the proposed topic of this book, but will not walk away satisfied with what Lewis has stated. What is she trying to prove? What does all of this information mean? These questions aren't answered, and for myself that was very frustrating."
4,Some disappointment,"Too bad it's in MONO......I couldn't believe it!C'mon, this is more than ten years after stereo!Fire the audio engineer!"
4,A lost gem from the 70's.,"This is a good Poco album. Why it never received the acclaim that it should have is still a mystery to me. Bands like the Eagles take claim to 70's country rock, but Poco runs circles around them. The title track is enough reason to buy this album. Once you do, you'll want others. This is the last of their classic sound before they went pop in the late 70's."
4,+ 1/2 Stars...Another Solid Album From Furay & Co.,"On this 1972 release of eight originals and one cover tune (an arguably superior version of the Buffalo Springfield's ""Go and Say Goodye"" written by Stephen Stills), Poco put together one of its best albums. Band members Richie Furay, Paul Cotton and Timothy B Schmit each contribute excellent songs. Highlights include Cotton's lovely ""Ride the Country"" and Schmit's achingly beautiful ""I Can See Everything."" But it's still Furay who steals the show with the rollicking ""And Settlin' Down,"" the gorgeous ""Sweet Lovin'"" and what should have been a monster hit, ""A Good Feelin' to Know."" Why Poco never had the kind of commercial success of the Eagles (whose debut was released just months before A Good Feelin' to Know) is a mystery. Fans of country-rock will want to add this to their collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,IT'S NOT THE SAVOY BROWN I EXPECTED,"In 1968 I moved to Berkeley from the LA area where I grew up. The music scene was fascinating; I remember listening to Savoy Brown's recordings in my tiny apartment near the University. I thought the vocals on A Step Further were edgy, creative and powerful. At the time I was also listening to a lot of John Mayall with Eric Clapton in addition to all of the San Francisco Bands (Quicksilver, It's a Beautiful Day, etc. etc.)Now, in 2004 I am re-living my late '60's era. My mistake was not researching the vocalist on previous Savoy Brown albums. What I thought I was getting was the incredible vocal stylings of Chris Youlden. Instead, Kim Simmonds lends his talents to this album, but they just don't move me at all. I hope others will realize this before purchasing this CD. It just doesn't hold up to other recordings by SB."
5,BACK TO THE ROOTS!,"IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, BUT KIM SIMMONDS HAS GONE BACK TO HIS ROOTS. THIS CD IS FILLED WITH THE KIND OF BLUES THAT SAVOY BROWN STARTED OUT PLAYING IN 1966. THIS ALL REMINDS ME OF THE FIRST 3 ALBUMS: ""SHAKEDOWN"",""GETTING TO THE POINT"",AND ""BLUE MATTER"". SOME REALLY FINE MATERIAL HERE, PLAYED BY SOME GREAT MUSICIANS. KIM SIMMONDS STILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO GET DEEP INTO THE BLUES.NATHANIEL PETERSON (BASS& VOCALS),TOM COMPTON (DRUMS)ALSO SEEM TO SHARE THE SAME RESPECT FOR THE BLUES AS KIM SIMMONDS DOES.I WOULD LIKE TO SEE DAVE MAXWELL (PIANO)BECOME A FULL TIME MEMBER, BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD PLAYING LIKE THAT SINCE THE OLD DAYS WHEN BOB HALL PLAYED ON THE EARLIER ALBUMS. ALL IN ALL A GREAT LISTEN WHICH LEAVES ME WANTING MORE AND MORE.I GIVE THIS CD VERY HIGH PRAISE, AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
5,like the good old days,"I can still remember when I saw savoy brown perform as backup for Led Zepplin along with Jethro Tull.both of which I went out and bought the next day along with Zeps first.the moment I heard kim simmonds do his riffs on guitar I knew thats what I wanted for my own group.the blazing instumentals really rock even though its supposed to be a blues band and dave[aka lonesome dave]is no longer with them.he was also a great guitarist who went on to form the now defunked Foghat.if your a blues or rock fan you'll want this album as kim only proves he gets better with age.hes second to none in a class by himself.stevie ray vaughn came close but kim outdoes himself on this one,shades of old.like mikey says ""try it you'll like it""you can take that to the bank.I do not joke when it comes to music seriously!"
1,600 bones.. WTF?,"ok..WOW... here's a little tip: don't ever buy a CD for 600 dollars, no matter how rare it is. you can find it if you look. seriously, who's the moron who paid that much for a simple re-issue disc, when there's accessibility to a different website, maybe NOT one based in the great 48, and MAYBE that same issue, disc and everything was not even 1/20th that much!!oh, and sincerely, you're not gonna find a bigger Nilsson fan, c'mon, why else would I be writing this?"
5,DELIGHTFUL CLEANER AND SAFE TOO!!,"Endust is THE cleaner for all your sensitive electronics, computers, LCD's, smartphones and anything plastic!Cleans and protects with a mild anti-static effect.Simply the best plastic cleaner you can find anywhere - No scratching, No residue.I use it on my iPhone, my computer screen, my TV's, all my plastic lenses and anything else that I want to clean without glopping it up with wax residue. Just use a soft cloth and a slight spray and you get CLEAN."
4,Reliable cleaning spray,"Good item to have to clean my computer screen every now and then. I also use it on my phone and my iPod touch once and a while, as well as my keyboard portion of my MacBook Pro laptop. Kind of pricy, but a good size spray. Save some money by combining with other items in order to qualify for the free shipping deal.Overall, good quality spray for anyone looking to clean their gadgets."
2,Disappointed,"DO NOT USE ON DISPLAY!This is only for the outside of a computer or electronic device. It is not to be used on the screen. It says, the screen will melt, if you use it on your display. This makes it problematic.Get a product that is safe for using on all products. This has anti-static cleaning but can only be used on the metal or plastic areas. Not so good. Endust should have a newer version out (only my guess)."
1,The great southern poser compilation with a sound worse than hell.,"Jeez. This tribute to pantera sucks. I've never heard of these bands that did the covers but that's probrably because they suck. All of these covers are horrible, espeacially the great southern trendkill and cowboys from hell. If you want real pantera, get the albums from the acuall band, pantera! Oh yeah, the album cover is a joke! It's a panther like person with all of thease piercings on it and it's purple! That's just gay. It looks like a kid drew it. This album is Complete bulls**t. Get the real pantera instead, not this poser album."
2,Pretty Awful,"This is a really poor tribute cd. The only thing even remotely interesting on this cd is A.C.'s version of the Great Southern Trendkill. And that's because they splice it with ""Rock the World"" from Pantera's Power Metal cd. The bands included here just do a bad carbon copy of the songs without bringing anything new to them. Buy the Southern Death tribute to Pantera instead."
1,"My god, is this a joke!",I mean this CD is god awful. The only band on here I know is Pissing Razors. And look at the Art work on the CD! Its more like an Insult to Pantera. Its like a wolf-panther dude with fangs and he is purple and its a cartoon! Its really poor and so are the songs. AVOID!
4,A great resource for DVD creation...,"While the subject matter in the Complete DVD Book is fairly complicated and technical, it is made much easier to understand because of the writing style, explanations, and step-by-step diagrams. The book has a tremendous amount of information, and while it gets technical in some places, it is never boring or ponderous. The Complete DVD Book is the perfect resource for those who are adept with the necessary programs and are planning on doing this more than just once or twice. Not recommended for purchase for those with very basic understanding of DVD burning software, it is a valuable tool for those who have a mid-range understanding of this software.(...)"
5,Me Encanta!,"Got this for my little one, and she was instantly attached! She loves the little songs about numbers and colors, and she loves the classical music. The classical music snippets tell you who the composer was. You can also set it to ""potpurri de canciones"", where the snippets cycle through once. The songs are very cute, and the Spanish is authentic (which is very important to us, as we are a Spanish speaking family). I absolutely love this toy, and so does she!"
5,A wonderful Gift for Christmas,"This is one in a series of books, each for a different occasion. There is also one for a birthday blessing, a bridal blessing, and a new house. They are full of wishes for the person/ persons to whom they are being presented. I saw them in a book store in California but didn't want to bring them home in my luggage and was hoping they would be available through Amazon and they are. I will be ordering them as each occasion/holiday presents themselves. They are chock full or beautiful thoughts for the person/persons."
4,Prompt response; condition as promised,"I was happy to receive the Pregnancy transparencies earlier than quoted. The quality of the book was also very good. Overall, I was very satisfied with the quality and service."
5,Nice fit - Great feel,"After reading past reviews, I decided to order large rather than medium since I have generous hips and I am very pleased with the fit - snug but not binding. The silky feel of the outside of the fabric plus the soft underside makes me feel cozy and warm at work even though I sit next to a large window. My dress slacks slide easily over these long underwear. I will definitely order them again."
4,A Classic,"To think that an Italian composer created the quintessential ""Western"" sound for cheesy B-movies shot in the Spanish desert by another Italian director, Sergio Leone.It worked! This disc features some classic moments of music from ""Fistful of Dollars"" and the grand epic ""Once upon a time in the West,"" both of which are spaghetti-western classics.But as an added bonus, there are some far rarer tracks from some Westerns that have yet to be released in the U.S. The highlights of the disc are ""A Gringo Like Me"" and ""Lonesome Billy,"" two plaintive cowboy-ballads that would give Kenny Rogers a run for his money.Yes. These tracks are cheesy and simple, but they are funny as very catching. I only wish that Peter Tevis, the singer, would have an album available somewhere."
3,Great group of western music,"Has alot of music from westerns I didn't recognize, but also had a few staples I expected.Good listening if you're a fan of western soundtracks."
4,Pocket Watch Song,"If you are just looking for the ""Musical Pocket Watch Song"" like I was it can be found under the Italian name ""La resa dei conti"" by Ennio Morricone I won't plug where, but it can be found."
4,One of My All Time Favorites,"I had always loved the old ""spaghetti westerns"", especially ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". I'm not really sure why I bought this cd, but it is one of the best decisions of my musical life! At first I just zipped around to the more familiar titles, then began to listen to the whole thing. This music is so beautiful, romantic, sweeping, eerie, suspenseful, sad, and sometimes comical, the scope and genius of this music is incredible. I am not a big soundtrack fan, but I play this cd constantly. Everyone I have played it for, having all kinds of musical tastes, liked it on first listen (at the very least). If you like classical, spanish, or the movies that they are from, buy this cd, you won't regret it!"
3,Some Of Them Ain't So Legendary!,"Phew! Quite a few stinkers in this collection. Avoid all the non-Leone selections with the exception of ""From man to man"" from Death Rides A Horse. I think Quentin Tarantino used that one in Kill Bill, Vol.1.Does anyone really care about ""Gunfight at Red Sands""? I thought not."
3,Does what it says,"I just wish the tip was sharper. I can correct bigger areas like the sides of my nails, but when it comes to near cuticle, not so great."
5,It takes you there.,"I couldn't put this book down. I felt as though i was alongside the wagon on it's way from Oregon towards the ""Four Corners"", and with Hilda & Ken through life at their trading post. Early 1900's life on Navajo Land was anything but simple. Hilda's writings carry you with her through suspense, joys, dancing, humour, births, sickness, deaths, everything we experience now, but as a white woman in an Indian world in a time when life was much more basic, survival was difficult & and instant gratification didn't exist...I loved it!"
3,Searching for Daniel French,"This book had its moments, but overall I found it rather disappointing. I liked the set-up of the story--a heroine wishing for a little excitement and getting way more than she bargained for--but I felt the story dragged in spots and I didn't really buy the hero's reasons for disappearing (or just about anything in his back story, come to think of it). There were a few too many (and repetitive) sex scenes for my taste, and several things about the story that didn't make sense. For instance, Dylan is a fugitive who kidnaps Claire and has the sheriff looking for him, but later, he's able to wander around their small town (where everyone knows everybody else) making grocery runs, and is even introduced to one of Claire's friends without anyone questioning who he is. I didn't completely dislike the story, but I did find parts of it difficult to accept."
5,Theresa Weir touches on the insecurities in many of us,"Maybe other people in the world never spend hours doubting themselves, or destroying relationships because they can't quite say what they really mean. Or maybe they're just afraid to admit it. As so many times in the past, Theresa Weir has tapped into primal fears and expressed them with love and humor. Both Dylan and Claire are on the run from life and themselves; it's definitely an expression of ""Some Kind of Magic"" that they find each other. Readers who want perfect heroines and poster quality heroes won't enjoy this book. For the rest of us, it's a cozy read by the winter fire to warm you up from the inside out. It's also an expression of hope for all of us who hope one day to stumble into happily ever after. You have to take the risk of that first step"
4,Pure Mate!,"On Claire's thirtieth birthday she blows out the candles on her cake and wishes for some excitement in her life. Even though she did not manage to blow out all the candles, her wish came true. She was carjacked at gunpoint!The tables turn and Dylan becomes the captive. Snowed in at Claire's mountain cabin with no phone. The longer the two are together, they see that there is more to each other than meets the eye. ""Mothball Lady"" is an excellent painter. ""Escaped Fugitive"" is nothing of the sort.Claire is in love with Dylan, but thinks he does not REALLY return the feelings. Claire had been using a birthday present from a friend. A voo-doo doll. If only he could love her for herself, she would hide him from the law forever!This one will give you the ""warm fuzzies"" at the end. I laughed out loud at parts and sighed in envy at others. The perfect read for cold and lonely nights.***"
3,"Not a paranormal, though the cover and blurb indicate such.","I've never read any of Ms. Weir's work before, and I'm not sure that this read would prompt me to buy another of her books. As a paranormal/romance fan I was very dissapointed that the book did not deliver on the promise of magic that it hinted at in the blurb and the opening scene. This is NOT a paranormal and the voodoo doll/birthday wish premise is what prompted me to buy it in the first place. Though the h/h interaction was all right, and she kept you guessing if Dylan is a bad/good guy, I felt there was a real problem with plot holes and undeveloped leads. I.E., the sheriff who's sweet on the heroine but doesn't check up on her on a regular basis, espcially after her 'car wreck' and her bad cold. A small town where *nobody* (?) gives the strange/new guy a grilling about where he lives, who he is, where he's from? I'd have to rate this average."
4,"Quick, entertaining read","Interesting, well developed characters made this a good read. The ""twist"" wasn't a real surprise, but the author's slow reveal through Dylan's history worked well. I appreciated the way the author switched between Dylan & Claire's point of view--this can get clumsy if not done well, but it worked here.Overall this was an entertaining escape. Strong characters overcame the at times silly and contrived plot. But then it is contemporary romantic fiction, so silly and contrived plot lines are to be expected to some extent--at least these were done well."
5,"great product by Vikings, same price but with ECC","the price is the same but this one with ECC support...so why don't you guys buy this one instead...with lots of personal investment and other financial applications running on the computer systems, data integrity is crucial....but remember some systems require you have all the memory modules ECC-capableinstallation is quite easy and enjoy the high speed....."
2,A sad document from two major talents,"I love Harry Nilsson, really I do. There's more than a little genius scattered among his catalogue, and nearly all his albums have something to offer, even the spottier later era stuff.That said, Pussy Cats is really a travesty. A waste of Nilsson's hiterto amazing voice... And a waste of Lennon's formidable talents. Barely passable effort applied to barely passable material...This has remained in print, on-and-off over the years, primarily for the Lennon name in the marquee. But there isn't another proper Nilsson album (or Lennon album, for that matter) that I would hesitate to recommend over this one...This album makes me sad, but for all the wrong reasons.dap"
2,Years Too Late,"This album would have been a blockbuster if Nilsson and Lennon would have teamed up some years earlier, or at least sober. The songs are mixed well but Nilsson is a shade of himself and it almost makes you wince when he trys to use the tremendous range his voice once had. Lennon was only in this to return a favor to Nilsson and it is very evident from the first to last track. Sad."
4,Franciscan Collector's Source Book,"My father worked for Gladding-McBean, Interpace and Franciscan for nearly 30 years so I grew up with this company, toured the factory and factory shop on many occasions, and went to university on an Interpace/Franciscan scholarship. This book does a nice job of combining the history of the business with descriptions of the products they manufactured. The color photos are excellent and there are pictures of some very rare pieces. A bonus is the designer drawings of some of the products plus some that never made it to the stores. Included is the 1999 Replacements price guide to Franciscan ware. BTW, American-manufactured Franciscan ware is a thing of the past (the plant was closed years ago) and the current English & Portuguese Franciscan pieces are made on different molds and designs - and the site of the Los Angeles factory is now home to a Costco mall."
3,A good book,"This is probably the best book on Franciscan dinnerware around. It gives a lot of information on the company, it's history etc. I would have liked to see more information and photos on the handpainted items, namely the Apple and Desert Rose varieties. There are only a few pages devoted exclusively to them. There is a price guide included that covers most of the items, although it doesn't show photos of each piece. I think it's a pretty good book though and I'm glad I bought it."
3,Some things lacking . . . .,"The book is well written and I've learned quite a bit. However, I don't like that there isn't a photo of every piece (like the child's plate) or how to tell the difference between a casserole and a covered vegetable. I also didn't like that the price guide doesn't break down the year the item was made, just prices of American made, and made in England. Is one made in 1941 worth more than one in 1980??? The book and the guide doesn't say. I also felt as though it was CLEARLY written from a SALES perspective, complete with a photo of The Replacements headquarters on the back cover!"
5,Franciscan:An American Dinnerware Tradition,"My Father was the last Dinnerware Plant Manager for Franciscan China while it was still made in California. This book included alot of Franciscan China that is usually left out. I recommeded this book to my Father, who bought it and loved it too."
1,bunk,There is no basis to this book.. not science anyway.. Watch the HBO Real Sports video about steroids.. Yes for kids.. roids are very very bad. But this book just preys on fear.In the USA these days.. find a way to scare people and you can make a buck.. LAME. Just say no and save your money.
1,Children have no place taking performance enhancing drugs.,"Children have no place taking performance enhancing drugs, and for that message the book earns its one and only star.Jeff Rustein did not nearly die from steroid use; he nearly died from alcohol and recreational drug abuse. Furthermore, steroids have never been found to be the primary cause of death for anyone, ever.Far too much hype and misinformation to be taken seriously."
4,Great cautionary book on steroid abuse!,"This is a really powerful personal story of what steroids can do to you, your family, and your life. Every teenage athlete should read this book!"
2,Boring,"I actually dozed off watching this! I was a bit disappointed because unlike other cooking shows, he wasn't very good at giving instructions/directions about how to make something. For example, when I watch a show on the Food Network, like Rachael Ray, Sunny Anderson, Sandra Lee, Paula Deen, Ina Garten, Giada De Laurentiis, etc. those shows do an excellent job of walking you through the recipe step by step. I found that while Gordon Ramsay's other shows are very entertaining, what with him shouting and cursing out the staff in their kitchens, when it comes to directing an audience on how to cook a meal, he's very lacking. He seem to have been talking about other things instead of telling the viewer what he was doing. For example, while he was cooking up the ham, he was telling the audience stories. I wanted to know what he was doing to the ham!"
3,MIO Zone Heart Rate Watch,"It is an OK watch. It does not appear to have a way of setting the seconds. I liked the Mio watch that I had before this one better. (It should be noted that it only lasted about 4 years--the strap less and there was no replacement for it from Mio. I find that it is often slow to respond to reading my pulse rate. This included the gym where the amount of skin moisture should be enough to give a reading. I will think twice about ordering a Mio replacement, should it fail as did the last one."
2,Not good,"It is VERY hard to push down the heart rate button, which makes the watch useless. It takes ALOT of finger pressure just to keep the button down. SO hard to get a reading. AVOID!"
1,Don't waste your money on this dud.,"Don't waste your money. In the instructions, Mio says to ""gently"" hold down the lower sensor button, supporting your index finger by pushing against the band clasp with your thumb (which is a ridiculous design, anyway), but I had to press it extremely hard and it still had problems staying in the pulse reading mode. The metal upper sensor is not a good design, either. After getting two readings in twenty attempts, I returned this piece of junk. It was so frustrating to use that it increased my heart rate and cramped my fingers. I just ordered another Mio Breeze from Amazon.com, as my last one worked great and was very easy to use. I'm not sure why Mio even puts their name on this dud. Spend the extra thirty bucks for the better watch -- you won't regret it."
2,Frustrating,"I purchased this watch specifically for monitoring my heart rate when I am working out. Well, that was a frustrating proposition. To get your rate while working out you must completely stop and then what appears to be an eternity you May get your heart rate or you have to start all over again while all the while your heart rate is dropping. As a watch its okay and if your getting your resting pulse its fine but once you get moving its so hit and miss that I am looking for a new watch."
2,Very impractical for workouts,"The first time I tired to use this watch for a workout, I gave up halfway through trying to use it. Its reading of the heart rate does not work unless your finger is in the EXACT location, and if you're not moving.The watch looks nice. I didn't have any problems using it, although I used it very little. I became too frustrated with the ridiculous heart monitor function.To be honest, its a piece of junk."
1,Disappointment,"Mio Zone Plus Heart Rate WatchI gave up using it. Most of the time it is impossible to get a reading. Beside, why would anyone sale something showing the date in a format not used in America here? You will be disappointed like I am"
2,Battery,When i go the watch it came with a battery and I just thought it was an extra and then my watch died and when i tried to replace the battery it was really difficult and once i got it in the watch didnt work right anymore
2,mio heart rate watch,"The strapless feature is still a plus, but compared to other mio watches I have purchased for just a slightly higher price, this is an inferior product."
1,Useless,After purchasing this watch I found that it was very difficult to get it to read my heart rate. I would have to stop whatever I was doing and concentrate on pressing those face plates. Due to this I found it useless for my workouts but it still seemed to be a decent watch. Then the battery died after 3 months. Once I managed to get the back off and put in a new batter I discovered that due to the design of the watch it is nearly impossible to get back together. Apparently you're meant to throw the watch away when the battery dies. I should have spent a little more and gotten a decent watch instead.
2,Very Poor design and HRM,"Very quickly...You have to press a button, place your fingers, and hold everything VERY still. Even then, it only works about 50% of the time and when it actually works, I found my resting HR would change 10pts or more within the same 30 seconds.Consider this a defective HRM."
1,Great Watch; rotten HRM,"Thank goodness I bought this product on sale. All the customary sport watch functions are great. However, as a heart-rate-monitor this product sucks. It is erratic in its readings, frequently either overrating my heart rate (235!) or underrating it (64) while walking briskly. Most often, though, I can't get a reading at all. During my last (and final) use of this product, I was able to get an HR reading only 5 times out of 18 attempts during an hour-and-a-half walk. Wouldn't use this product again even if it was gift. Too frustrating to use."
1,Watch did not work,There is very little to say. I received the watch in good condition but it would not work. I returned it with no hassle.
2,Mio Watch,"After several weeks of having the watch, I noticed that it is taking longer to check the pulse. I use it at my spinning class and when it is time to check you can't move by the slightest or it won't read. Maybe it could be the battery."
1,"Not so pleased, could have just been defective...","I recieved the watch in working order, then things went down hill from there. I started to program the watch.Suddenly, the screen went blank, and it never worked again. I believe it was just defective, and recieved arefund. So all in all, I was satisfied with the service, just not the product."
1,Beware of connector size,"I just bought the 14', 25' and 50' versions of Belkin Cat6 ethernet cable. BUYER BEWARE, they must have recently changed the size of the connector. I've tried plugging these into computers, switches, routers, and bluray players, and all just barely accept the connector. It appears twice as thick as ""normal"", and is so thick that the unlocking tab will not unlock. I had to use a screwdriver to pull the connectors back out. I have Ativa and Cables To Go Cat6 cables, all of which have normal connectors. Hope this review will allow you to avoid equipment damage!Update: I just bought a blue 75' Belkin Cat6, and connector size is normal. The only bad cables have been yellow - if that has any significance."
4,It works,Purchased this to connect my Wireless-N router to my MediaSmart Home Server so I can increase the speed of transfer from my Wireless-N equipped Desktop. Works pretty slick and am getting at least 40% back from my network in speed.
5,Extraordinary Women from U.S. History,"Teachers and parents take note: this is a wonderful resource for bringing history to life! These plays about women who made significant contributions to America are designed to be read by students in a classroom, but are also great for families around a dinner table. The well-crafted texts cover Harriet Tubman, Sacagawea, Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Earhart, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Eleanor Roosevelt, Nellie Bly, Babe Didrikson Zaharias and Elizabeth Blackwell--a cross section of inspiring women. The author also includes background information, follow up activites, and presentation suggestions. Excellent all round!"
5,Terrific Electronics Cleaner,"This is by far the best cleaner I have found for electronics. I use it most often on my laptop as this is one of the few products in this class that is safe on LCD screens.I highly recommend this to everyone. Cleans not only the screen of your laptop or flat-screen monitor, but is safe and effective in cleaning the case and keyboard of your desktop/laptop, and works great on your television and audio components.Many people don't realize this, but static around your electronics often causes strange problems with their operation. These wipes are also anti-static, which can help reduce some of these problems.Get some of these and keep them handy; they're terrific."
1,"NOT FOR LCD, PLASMA, OR LAPTOP SCREENS !!!","I ordered these wipes to clean my pc and flat screen lcd's. Even the reviews seemed to rave about the lcd cleaning capability. To my suprise when i got the wipes, on the back is says ""IMPORTANT: NOT FOR USE ON LCD & PLASMA TVS OR LAPTOP SCREENS"" Enough said. I'll be returning these."
1,"Not for LCD, plasma or laptops","Not sure what the first person to review received, but the Endust I received has a warning on the back saying ""WARNING: Not for use on LCD & plasma TV's or laptop screens""...which is annoying since I bought it for my laptop screen. It does how ever clean the screen very well since I only saw the warning after I cleaned it!!!!!!!"
2,Don't let the description and reviewers lie to you,"I'm putting this in caps to keep someone from making the same mistake as me... ""IMPORTANT: NOT FOR USE ON LCD & PLASMA TVS OR LAPTOP SCREENS."" That is written on the back of the product's container. I find it very suspicious that some reviewers said this is safe on screens when it clearly states it is not. Don't fall into the trap like I did!I am only giving this 2 stars instead on 1 because I used it to clean my mirror and it didn't leave any streaks..."
3,OK cleaning rags,These are ok electronics dust rags. They don't have as much alcohol on them as I would like. Doesn't always remove dried spots from the screen.
4,Great Horror Prop,"The hands are surprisingly realistic. I thought I was going to get a pair of cheap plastic hands. The only flaw that I noticed is the left hand seems to look longer than the right hand or maybe a little disfigured. I dont know but from a distance it looks funny. My Husband makes Dummys for low budget horror attractions and thinks they are perfect. He says they couldnt have made them any better, unless they would have used silicone rubber. And a great price too! Its hard enough to find just a left hand anywhere but you get a pair which is even better.I recommend them 100%"
3,Bad Information On CD,I really have to say that this CD is really good although the information on the CD is far from correct. This Cd is listed as having 14 tracks and only has 10.. The song list not only has the wrong amount of songs but the list is not in the correct order. It's just amazing to me how sloppy this was done when it could have been a very special CD to have. Why couldn't they have put all of the songs on the CD that are listed?????????
3,Titles of the songs,"The music is excellent as I love Kate Smith's music and that era; however, it would've been nice if I selected song 2 from the song list (that is on the cover of the cd) and song 2 played. I get song 8 or song 5. And no, it is not my cd player for as soon as this happened I put in another cd and it played according to the song list."
1,Modern Locomotive Construction,This Kindle version of this book is terribly edited.There is exactly the kind of information you'd expect but99% of all the important formulas are garbled. I think someoneread the book into a terrible version of speech to text software.Don't bother buying this as it will only frustrate you when reading it.The hardback version is a bit pricey but the Kindle version is worthless.
1,What a shocker,Some great pic from Barry. Joel Gilbert lets the team down big time.If you want some good pictures of Bob than this is ok.[...]
1,Totally deceptive packaging,"Based on the title and cover photo, most folks would expect some Dylan performances. If you notice the small font subtitle in the lower right corner, you might suspect that is not what you'll get. What you do get is a third rate documentary about Dylan's photographer (who seems a nice enough guy) at the time. But the guy making the film and doing the interviewing is a weird and creepy Dylan obsessive and an inept interviewer too boot. I felt totally ripped off by this DVD."
3,Good,"The film is less than it could have been. Sometimes looks like an amateur documentary, but the work of Barry Feinstein worth it."
1,Duplicate of Earlier CD,"As another reviewer pointed out, this CD is an exact duplicate of an earlier CD by the same artist. All Sugo Music did was slap on a new title, a different cover, and change the order of the songs.The original CD release, Ancient Moon Rising Sun, is a really enjoyable production and the hammered dulcimer work is gorgeous and worth a listen. ButI'm really peeved that due to Sugo Music's false advertising and shady moves, I got stuck with this identical copy of a CD I already own."
4,Good Celtic Music,"This is a great CD to listen to while writing or drawing. It's interesting without being overbearing, and I'm glad to have it in my collection. If you like this, you would probably like ""Maidens of the Celtic Harp"" as well."
5,This C.D waz very down to earth.,This C.D. was the bomb.It really moved me. She is my favorite female singer. I'm krazy about her songs.No##1 fan.
5,heartfull,"i put kelly price along side some of the best singers of the past, she hurts you heart with the way she sings her song. and lets you know you<are not alone when your heart hurts,go girl~~~~ mary"
5,KELLY PRICE IS LONG OVERDUE!,"Kelly Pice is one of the hottest music commidities to come out of the background. She has written,sang-backup,arranged,and co-produced for top selling artists such as Mariah Carey, Brian McKnight, SWV, Gina Thompson,and her Bad Boy family Puff Daddy and his crew. I've waited on her for so long. She is like Faith Evans, cool, laid back, and just relaxed. With this album, Kelly was the first person to co-write with R. Kelly. She has production from the Hitmen, Ron ""Mr. Biggs"" Isley, and R. Kelly himself, just to name a few. Her soothing voice will get you your lady or man back. If there is anything you need to know about Kelly Price! Buy and listen to the album!"
5,So dazzling that it blinded me with science!,"A tour-de-force power relaxation video. It is like virtual relaxation pills with binaural beats, flashing light and moving through morph-innerspace. The graphics are crazy cool. Who needs sleeping pills now? It works very well, worth checking out."
4,Well Done!,"This DVD is quite effective in eliciting the ""frequency following response"". For those who don't understand or who are bothered by the stroboscopic flashing, that flashing is in the alpha/theta wavelength and if you just relax into it, your mind will enter into an alpha/theta brainwave state which is where meditation, lucid dreaming and hypnagogic imagery take place. For anyone who doesn't like the strobe, it CAN be turned off in the menu settings. The images are quite pleasing and the music is decent for this type of thing. My only qualm with the producer of this DVD is that the sequences change too quickly; just when you are really getting into some of the better sequences they change into something different and not as good. If he had just stuck with some of the better sequences longer I would rate this 5 stars. This DVD is in 4:30 only. There is a volume 2 in 16:9 which has even better imagery."
5,Dreams Really Do Come True,"AV3X is the Dream come to life. Beyond what happens to the visual cortex and the auditory cortex during a ""session"" lies another experience entirely. AV3X has the power, the capability to afford an out-of-body experience. Typically, viewers don't get past the ""storyline"" in movies. The cinematography, the locations and even the feelings trying to be communicated to the viewer are often lost. AV3X can bring the viewer into the experience that lies at the periphery of the astonishing light and sound. This experience transcends AV3X itself. So AV3X is, therefore, a vehicle to a higher plane of consciousness. Anyone who finds themselves somehow caught between opinion and reality has yet to find the true jewel that lies within this paradox. BRAVO Mr. Oliver. Will there be an AV4X?"
2,I wanted more from this,"This looked quite promising to me, but I've used it about 5 times, and although the visual effects are cool it does nothing to help relax or focus me."
2,Someone please turn off the strobe!,"I wanted to like this DVD, very good graphics. But there's a constant strobe (white flicker) throughout the DVD that I find terribly annoying. I think it's supposed to help induce meditation, but I think it kinda kills this DVD. For me at least."
3,Not meditation-tripping,"I'm not sure what kind of meditation these other reviewers are doing, but this is not meditation, more like hypnosis. This video is really cool all around if your in trance dancing at a Rave party. Awesome graphics and a wierd constant white stobe effect. I gave this three stars because it was misrepresented, it is a perfect dance/party video."
5,"A Fun Way to Relax and Have a Mind ""Experience""","This is a really neat DVD. You could even call it an ""experience"". It is hard to describe, but it is very pleasant and so relaxing. I was pretty surprised how I felt when I tried it - much better than the audio tapes I have been using. I really love the images because they are so colorful and interesting. Definitely worth a try! It is relaxing fun!"
5,Great Gift Idea - Unique and very cool,I just watched my copy of this DVD last night and it is soooo kewl! It is very calming and spacey. Even my cat was watching the TV and looking zen. I am back to order a couple for Christmas gifts. If you are looking for a very unique and very cool gift idea...THIS IS IT!
5,AV3X is a D.R.E.A.M. = Divine Relaxation Experience - A Masterpiece,"This one is truly a treat for the senses. I love track III - ""Transcendence"". It has lovely ocean waves and dreamy images. I especially enjoy the ""rings"" that you seem to fly through. The music is in the ambient space style and top notch. This movie also uses brain machine sound and light stimulation which definately adds to the meditation effect. It is a Divine Relaxation Experience - A Masterpiece. (D.R.E.A.M.). I am interetsted to learn more about brain machine sound and light stimulation and am considering getting a brain machine to try."
5,A little known treasure,"This barely-known musical based on O'Neill's ""Ah Wilderness!"" is worth listening to and -- if you're a producer -- worth doing because of the great score and lyrics. They wonderfully capture the people and the period. It needs a new major production."
3,"Quite moving, in a simple way","Go back to the early days of broadway musicals and you will find this charming musical to be quite moving. Although the cast lacks any great performances, save Jackie Gleason's Tony Award winning portrayal of Uncle Sid, the lyrics are sung in a heartfelt way. Simple melodies, along side the tongue twisting lyrics keep you listening. The score lacks any show stopping musical numbers, however the soft shoe duet to the title song between Unlce Sid (Gleason) and Nat Miller will be running through your head. Take Me Along is as far from any modern Broadway musical as you can get, but overall it is a pleasant change."
5,Lots of power,"I was impressed with the cleaning of this detergent. Such a little amount needed, and did a thorough job."
4,Waylon at his best?,"Many reviews will tell you that this album, ""Honky Tonk Heroes"" is Waylon at his best. Well I slightly disagree. Although this album, along with ""Dreamin' my dreams"" are indeed Waylon at the top of his game, this is second place next to the latter. This one is kind of folksy and lacks the punch that I am used to hearing from Waylon. Even the first song, ""Honky Tonk Heroes"" is not the same from the very improved studio version found in RCA's greatest hits version. This album will grow on you and you will appreciate the subtle aspects that other reviews speak of, so dont hesitate to buy it. But, ""Dreamin my Dreams"", now that is really the Waylon I know and love."
5,Nice product,"Arrived on time...price was right. Exactly as pictured. Flexible enough to be able to handle easily. Haven't had to use yet, but I am sure it will everything expected"
1,Crashes my DELL L433c!! Not compatible!,I installed this Viking 128MB in my DELL L433c in second memory slot.. First slot has original 128MB DELL 311-0410. Machine crashed (blue screen) upon booting into Windows 98. Pulled the Viking memory out.. machine comes up fine.. tried installing just the Viking memory (in place of the DELL memory).. upon booting screen goes blank after DELL screen.. will not BOOT up..Incompatible with DELL 311-0410 PERIOD!! I have learned from Viking support that the correct memory is Viking part number DL1664CL3P8.
3,Crashed Dell V433c,"Website stated this was correct part for Dell V433c but it was not. However, shipping/return process excellent - arrived in time specified, no problems returning, credit to account timely.Easiest return I have ever made! So, 1 star for part, 5 stars for return process = 3 stars average."
5,more ram = better,"Fit well, works great. use the memory finder and search that way. Almost failsafe. Easy to install. Great value"
5,Still an excellent classic,"This book is the most condensed, accessible discussion of genetic manipulation techniques and methods around. Armed with this, one can move on and understand any other text in the area."
4,Recombinant DNA: Genes and Genomes,This product was good for its intended purpose of use in a college class. I would recommend it since it is light-weight and easy to carry. :)
4,bearing his soul,"i pickup pj's new album, ""pj is dating your sister"" after seeing him live at souix fall this labor day. after listening to the album 100+ times, i think i have a grasp on it. songs like orange county and sam the goat give a testimony and confession at the same time. what is love and all alone speak of his weaknesses. this album does an excellent job in the release of everything deemed important and satisfying in this fleeting world. listen with your ears then listen with your heart. tasty, tasty tracks with lyrics that have boggled my brain. the beats are positive and uplifting along with his message."
3,"Rhymes clever, beats ok","I really love Pigeon John after hearing him featured on several other cds (DJ Maj's ""Fullplates Mixtape"", .rodlaver's ""Trying Not to Try"" etc.) and I love his unique almost whiny voice rap. But unfortunately I didn't care for the beats so much on this album, not very original, almost mainstream-sounding. Also too many hooks, and too much sing-song verses. I was expecting a little more underground style. But his lyrics are clever and his hip-hop style unique. Best songs are #5 Emily (tearjerker), #2 Life Goes On (really like Abstract Rude on this one), #1 High School Reunion (catchy), and #11 Sam the Goat (original and humorous). A good album for P.J.'s different style but I think he would sound better w/ diff. beats."
4,still can't ditch that N-word - but he'z tight,"ok, i GOTTA espouse from tha giddy that even though this cat iz tight with hiz and darez 2 do with hiz music that otherz haven't even considered, i CAN'T STAND that he STILL holdz on 2 tha use of hiz verzion of tha n-word (read: niggiez). that iz tha ONLY knock i have against pigeon john - tha singsongy delivery that inundatez this (and hiz first solo offerin' ""....is clueless"") AND hiz overt avoidance of tha p-diddy school of hip hop track production iz a welcome change from tha monotonous and expressionless flowz and cookie-cutter loopz that tha market iz overflooded with. MOST NOTABLE: ""high school reunion"", a look back on how far he'z come since hawthorne high; ""deception"", a mixtape add-on that speakz on how hard it iz 2 cut thru tha world'z liez, and ""crazy"", which iz just about az self-explanatory az he getz. PEACE."
4,decent little cooker,for the price you can not go wrong. had a slight issue and company took care of it. very! small footprint
3,"Good Idea, Depends on what you are looking for","I want to start off by telling you what this stove is not...1)It is not a fix all for car camping, it is a very small stove. I could cook enough food for my wife and I on it in a sitting, that is without second helpings.2)It is not the ultra light weight toy that the extremist is probably looking for.3)Until you get used to how it folds it is a bit cumbersome. By three minutes in I had it figured out, no I am not the sharpest tool in the shed.I do think however that for the outdoor gadget world it has a nitch. If you are not strapped for weight or size issues and want to not carry fuel this will work just fine. I think for one person it could very well take care of your cooking needs. The pouch it comes in also has enough room for my Fire Steal Gobspark to slide in. I am not saying that it is for everyone, but for the price it is a fun option."
4,4th of july!,"I purchased one of these for a 4th of july camping trip with my girlfriend. I was looking for a small, simple, way to both start a fire for breakfast and make coffee before hand. the first thing that I noticed when i opened this was that it was wonderfully small, so small in fact that I didn't feel safe using it for my 12 cast iron skillet. it did work however to make coffee in a percolator and its quite fast to boil a quart of water. once done with making coffee, i just flipped it over with some tongs and dumped the hot coals onto my wood to start a campfire. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because its small, pretty sturdy, lightweight, and fast. It missed a star because after the first use it needed a paint job as all the original had blistered. If you do purchase one, go to walmart and pick up a can or krylon grill/bbq paint for $4, its rated for higher temps then most engine paints and retains the nice matte black look."
2,Too tippy for safe use.,"I bought this cooker for camping and also a back-up for boiling water in the fireplace if we had a power outage.The foldable design is nifty, but the arrangement for putting a pot of water on top is not stable. I tried the cooker with several different pots I might use camping, and was not satisfied. I would have had to hold the pot with one hand while the water heated, leaving only one other hand to manage adding fuel, and anything else that might come up.If I were planning to camp out of my backpack then I think I would be willing to use this little stove - but with little kids, I camp out of a car these days and I will be bringing a larger, more stable set-up.I have returned the stove."
4,Great for Camping,"Use this when i go camping. fits in my backpack well, especially like that it comes with a pouch."
5,Great little stove,"I bought this and a canteen cup to put in my atv for emergencies. I wanted a stove that did not require canned or bottled fuel. Since in an emergency that probably won't be available. To test things out I used it in the back yard, it was very easy to use and boiled water in just a few minutes. It did smoke pretty good, but so would a camp fire. It did soot up the canteen cup but again so would a campfire. It is fairly wind resistant but not a wind break in and of itself. The paint did bubble up and peel off after the first use, not a big deal for me since where I live is not a ""wet"" state. I think it will work great for what I bought it for. It does require almost constant ""fueling"" with small twigs and such but still easy to use. Very small and packable."
4,"maker,s careless mistake","The black paint blistered and came off the first time I used this otherwise good little pocket cooker. Why oh why don'tthe makers of this little stove use the readily available heat resistant paint to begin with? I own several of these andhave had to take each one to a machine shop, have them sand blasted down to bare metal , buy a spray cao of stovepaint and repaint them. What the manufacturers are doing is purely 'don't care'. Other customer reviews havementioned this. I'd gladly give this a 5 star rating except for that one defect."
3,No more running out of fuel,Good product at an affordable price. Pros: Easy to use. Can cook with sticks just lying around on the ground. Do not have to worry any more about how much fuel is left in a canister. Cons: The quality of the material used could be better. Overall a great product for just $12.
5,Sumptuous record!,"Kenneth Gilbert gives us a fresh and luminous performance of these Goldberg Variations one of the quintessential scores of the music in any age. Contemplative, enraptured and gifted of a fabulous approach. His immaculate technique and unerring playing involve us. Go for this record. Absolutely recommended."
5,Beautiful soothing collection of songs.,Songs range from quiet listening to rythmic sensual dance. A must for any music lover.
2,I hate the type style.,The words are so close to each other.So hard to read.Kind of expensive.I dont think it's a cost-efficient book.
4,The Picturne of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde,"I found the book sensitive, moving and still relevant today, even though the plot seems somewhat impossible. The way Wilde includes epigrams evey page breaks up the otherwise cocentrated text and makes the story more pleasant. I found myself putting the book down every so often to stop and think about the implications of certain events and take a break from the intensity, but, at other times, I was totally gripped by the thrilling plot. Yes, at times it moved a little slowly, but Wilde's totally individual and characteristic style managed to bring it off with class."
3,The Picture Of Dorian Gray,"If you were to ask anyone if they would like to look young for the rest of their life, you would mostly think that the anwser would be ""yes"". When Dorian Gray gazed upon his portrait and mumbled that he wished that he would stay that same as he appears in his portrait, the last thing that Mr. Gray expected was that his wish was going to come true. While time rolls on, Dorians friends start to suspect something of Mr. Gray, but do not really know how to ask him about it. As Mr. Gray's friends grow older, some people find out that Mr. Gray has a secret in the attic of his home."
3,Picture of Dorian Gray,"""Picture of Dorian Gray"" was a cleverly written book with very descriptive laungage. The book takes place over a span of about 20 years, in which the reader sees the transformation of the title character, Dorian Gray. He goes from an innocent boy of about twenty, to a cruel, consciounless man with the appearance of a twenty year old. While the book was entertaining and provided enough description to keep the reader amused, Wilde overdid it at some points, providing too much added information that took away from the simple plot of the novel. Over all though, it was a good book."
5,making me remember,"the Film,Martha and Ethel By Jyll Johnstone Was so Touching it made me think about My own childhood.Buy this documentary and it will reward you!!!!"
5,Big B Does It Again.......,"Big B release's his sophmore album ""White Trash Renegade"", And boy i was wrong, This cd is way better then his first album ""High Class White Trash"". Big B has really changed his style alot in this album. Big B's rhymes have gotten better, And his skills to rapping are just great, and terrific. The production is just so groovy, And Big B's flow's fit so perfect with the song's. Well I Hope Big B's next album would be as good as this. My favorite tracks are: Keep Going, White Trash Renegade, The Underground, And Shut The **** Up"
2,I Dont Get It,"I love new rap, old rap, rap rock and so on, but I dont get this. It sounds like EMINEM with a sore throat. Sure the lyrical content is different but the style seems identical. There is plenty of original work out there. Pass this up."
5,Imported intelligent dialogue. We don't have much here.,"In a country where reporting is as self serving as politics, it's grand to find a publication so enriched with intelligent dialogue, insightful thinking, un-poisoned by our politics or big money interests. It's wonderful to read the POV of those with enough distance to be able to sift the insanity into meaningful discussion...not to mention the literary excellence and wit with which it is done. Intelligence and excellence are addictive, especially when it's so rare."
4,Hammock Hanger,"I ordered 8 of these to make hanging my hammock faster, and for that, they work great. I am not a rock climber (yet). So i cant test them out. But i did pull a forklift with one, just to see how strog they are. Very light very strong and just the right size"
1,Don't buy!,"This book skims over topics. Nothing I've needed so far has been discussed in any depth. Not a single question I've had has been answered by this book - you're better off using Red Hat's online help than purchasing this monster. This book's helpful hints consist of telling you that yes, you have 2 options in this part of the install. NO explanation, no elaboration. Time to buy another Linux 7.2 book."
1,Look for another book.,"This book is fat, but oh so thin on good information. The first tip off about its inadequacies came in the section on disk partioning. It mentions that 6 partitions are recommended, but gives no indication about what the sizes should be. Gee, thanks for the help. ;-) Now I have to reinstall Linux to get the sizes right. The author spreads himself too thin."
1,Not at all helpful,"In my opinion this book is nearly worthless. I am a computer savy hobbiest learning how to create a personal web site. The books I used for PHP and MySQL are generally geared towards using those programs under Linux. I picked up this book to try to learn and install Linux. It has been a complete waste of money. The book covers many topics but NONE of them in depth. It repeatedly tells you to look at the man pages and other online sources for info, offering no explanations. It also tells you to ask your 'system administrator' to install or configure components. Hello! That's me. I've found much more helpful info online. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,A lot of advertising,The book contains some useful examples and case studies but overall feels like advertising for author's valuation website.A lot of information is repeated in several places.
3,"Some good info, but lots of advertising their service also.","Some good information, like explaining Discounted Cash Flow Approach (DCFA), but the constant sales pitching of their valuation service made me question their objectivity.All-in-all, I wouldn't buy it again."
5,I love this CD!,"I just bought this CD and I can't stop listening to ""My Heart Stays With You"". Anyone who is a big Howie D. fan will love this song!"
2,BSB NEEDS A NEW SOUND,"I am pretty much sick and tired of their same old sound, they are too over played. This song sounds much like all there other stuff, if they really want to stick around and draw fans they are going to need to do something to change there sound. Not to mention that this song makes absolutely no sense!!!!!"
5,IT'S TOTALLY MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,HI U GUYS To tell u the truth u guys must get this cd/audio coz it's really cool.I never liked any of their previous albums coz they never really touched the heart.But this is really sensational.
3,WHY WE LIKE EM!,"This song is the perfect reason why we like BSB.It has a great chorus, nice harmonies, and safe, relaxing music.Sounds like a cookie cutter style version of their other hits...very suprising considering they said they're style was going to be different on this album.Well....if you have a forumula that works..why break it...right? All in all an enjoyable song...not gonna be a classic..but fun anyway!"
3,I can't stand the group but.........,"I hate these people but this song is ok for easy listening.It's got unintelligent lyrics but the tune is cool.Yeah,you should also try listening to Hanson.They rock!Yes,but this song is pretty kewl.I hope I did not offend any one=)"
5,Phat!,"If you think I Want It That Way was awesome, wait until you hear Howie's incredible voice and the Boys' backup harmony for My Heart Stays With You. they're even better in the no. 1 hit potential, I'll Be There For You. I bought the CD for IWITW, but I'm listening to I'll Be There For You more! If you Boys see this, PUH-LEEZ- you have GOT to get I'll Be There For You as a released single of its own! It is so incredible. I'm telling you all, for the love of God (and the Boys) get this CD! You haven't heard the guys until you've heard the songs on this cd!"
4,Stylish!,"These Diesel sunglasses are stylish, but allow too much sunlight to get in. I do own another pair of Diesel sunglasses and the lens is dark enough to block the sunlight I need it to. I do however get a lot of comments on these sunglasses, so I would recommend them if you're looking for style."
1,Easily removable cover? Not!,"The description on the web site states that these cushions have an ""easily removable"" washable cotton-poly cover. Very misleading! They are simply squares of cotton-poly fabric sewn together and stufffed with polyester batting-no separate cushion, no removable cover. Anyone with a sewing machine could make a pillow like these for $3.00 each! Don't waste your money!"
4,"Neverness is brilliant, complicated, mind boggedly Sci Fi.","I have not even read all the book yet. But it is brilliant.I'm afraid I have'nt read much Sci Fi in my time. I usually find it far too technical for me. But, Zindell in this novel, manages to, not only tell a fantasic tale, he also explains rather detailed therioes in a simple way.I would recomend this book to any Sci Fi fan, of course. But also, anybody who is like me and just loves an excellent read."
5,An Undiscovered Gem!,"This book, and the series that follows is completely amazing.The writing is leagues better than most sci-fi, the scope is epic, the worlds and characters vivid. I just finished the whole 'Requiem for Homo Sapiens' series and I have to say that Zindell is one of the best SF writers out there right now (Greag Egan is good too). I haven't read another series this good since Cryptonomicon.Dive in... you'll love it."
3,...and it started so promisingly...,"Unfortunately, after a great opening, this book descends into an orgy of navel-gazing, psychobabble and attempted insight into the human condition. A brilliantly realised far-future hard SF setting is wasted by pages and pages of introspection, occasionally turgid prose, and more mathematics than is entirely necessary (even to those of us with advanced-level qualifications in the field!). Plot arcs with the potential to provide great advances in the story and the characters are skimmed over in a paragraph or two, while the interior meanderings of the non-particularly-appealing narrator spew out seemingly endlessly. The motivations of most of the rest of the characters are allowed to remain completely opaque, which might have been intentional but irritates me anyway. I'm still giving it 3 stars though - the universe of Neverness is far too well-drawn for a worse rating than that."
4,Sci-fi philosophy the way it should be done,"Hidden behind a poorly motivated story is a man's fascinating search for the meaning of life. His debates with various entities through the course of the story were interesting and smart. This book is certain to leave you thinking, and hopefully debating with your friends. On the downside, there is a large chunk in the middle of the novel where the characters live with some Fremen-inspired, Eskimo-like cavemen. Unless you enjoy reading detailed descriptions on the art of eating seal blubber, this could be a stumbling block in the otherwise smooth flow of the narrative."
3,Caution,"One should be careful to criticize the book that the author wrote rather than what you wish he wrote. Since Zindell is billed as a *hard SF* writer, I should say how well he fits that bill.He doesn't. Hard SF depends on the realistic depiction of future science based on what we know today. While Zindell sprinkles his text with the vocabulary of mathematics, he does so with so little motivation that the story would actually make more sense if it had been written as a fantasy, with *manifolds* and *theorems* replaced by *spells* and *incantations*.The book is heavily laden with philosophizing: about 30% of it, I'd say. And there are frequent digressions that do nothing to further the plot.Finally, although the story leads you along promising the solution to a grand puzzle at the end, the conclusion is anticlimatic and not at all clever."
1,cats quickly bored,i purchased this dvd because my cats really enjoyed volume I. But this turned out to be a bust. My cats were confused with the bird sounds in the backround and kept tring to find the birds. The lost interent in the fish pretty quickly and i turned of the dvd after 5 minutes.I would not recommend this one at all.
2,Shouldn't have fallen for this!,Okay so I have had cats for 50 years and never saw one pay too much attention to the computer or tv. But I thought what the heck maybe there is something special about these videos. Having two young kittens (6 months) I thought perhaps I would find the video kept them occupied for maybe a few minutes. Not so! The only thing they paid any attention to was the short video showing DA BIRD in use. They have DA BIRD and recognized it. Otherwise they could have cared less.
3,"Not too bad, not too great","I was somewhat disappointed with this dvd. My cats are interested but not too excited. Doesn't seem o hold there interest for long. Not a total loss though, it is better to have something that keeps them entertained for a little while than nothing at all. Though I must say I only put it on while I am at work so they may be enthralled all day long and I am just missing it. If you have cats, and they are bored, it is worth a shot."
3,Needs a bit more meow ---,"Ok, so maybe my cat has a little A.D.D., but some days she likes the video and some days she ignores it completely. I agree with the producer that you really need to leave this on when you are not at home - possibly due to other distractions our presence has, but when my cat gets ""into"" it, she can watch it for quite a while.I recommend this for people who are away from home alot, but still care for the mental care of their cats. If you can pick it up on sale, I would say it is a nice addition to have.This version has mostly fish tank scenes. There are some ""teaser"" loops for other videos which my cat seems like more than the aquariums - so maybe I just picked the wrong version for my cat. Nice aspect is that whatever scenes you choose, they automatically loop over and over, so it can draw the cats attention for quite a while."
5,To put it simple: Charming and delightful!,"Shoebag, the funny story of a young cockroach turned human is more than just a funny children's book. It has a strong message about changing, and still being the same. Read the book."
5,I love pretty-soft!,"In the fourth grade my teacher read the book Shoebag to us, and I loved it! My favorite character is Pretty-soft. I LOVED the way she was so spoiled!!!!!!! It was a big hit in my class!!!"
2,Eh...It was alright.,"Some things stand the test of time and some don't. This is one of them. I really loved this book when I was younger, but it just doesn't have the same nostalgic appeal as some other books do."
3,Strange story,"Shoebag is a strange book. It is about a cockroach named Shoebag that turns into a human. He turned into a cockroach while he was sleeping. When the people in the building noticed him they adopt him. He starts living a normal life, but his family is going to die. What will he do to be himself again and try to save his family?This book had some funny parts, but it was boring and it also didn't make sense. I just recommend this book to people who like fiction and strange stories."
4,Weird but good,"The book, Shoebag by Mary James is the weirdest book I've ever read. It's about a cockroach who becomes a person and how his life changes. Though it was weird I liked it. Before I read it I thought it would be boring, but it was incredibly funny. I recommend this book to whoever likes comedies"
2,Well written....poorly argued,"Susan Juster's Disorderly Women is well written, but her arguments concerning the ""feminine"" nature of early Evangelicalism and its transition to a more masculine form in the late 18th century are extremely poor. She relies mostly on her own heavily biased opinions, when in many cases, the primary source evidence she provides clearly contradicts her. On the whole, this book does a great disservice to anyone who would ever attempt to reasonably argue any of what is covered within this book, as Juster so completely fails in arguing her thesis that one is inclined to believe that just the opposite is probably true."

4,A detailed portrait of B. Young and his lasting influence.,"Arrington undertakes to transform Brigham Young fromcaricature to flesh and blood human being and does sobrilliantly. From his earliest days to the culmination of hislife and power as absolute leader of the Utah Mormons, theauthor weaves a tapestry that gives context to events and actions that notonly formed one of the great American leaders, but his churchas well. Particularly interesting is the genesis of many ofthe doctrinal and social peculiarities of the modern Mormons.Recommended for any student of the history of the AmericanWest or of Mormonism."
5,brigramn Young,Great book I bought the book for it's historial adventor not so much as areglious event but it was great on each countCowboyron
1,Avoid this book,"I downloaded the eBook version of this novel on Smashwords. It was nigh unreadable. I tried, but there were so many grammatical errors, continuity jumps, and lack of clarity that I could not finish. This is the first book in decades that I can say that about.There is the essence of a great story here, trying to get out. I just can't see it."
4,Great Recording of a Highly Important Work,"David Maslanka's Mass is given an excellent performance by Greg Hanson and the University of Arizona Wind Symphony. Although not perfect, the choirs and soloists do a fantastic job.Maslanka is one of the greatest and most important composers living today. His music will stand the test of time as influential, enjoyable, and amazingly powerful.We are lucky to have a great recording of such fantastic music available at our fingertips. If you are an instrumental music educator, you NEED this album in your collection. This is a wonderful recording of a landmark composition."
1,Weak performance,"This is the only recording of this work that is available. Unfortunantly the performance is so weak, it is impossible to tell whether or not the composition has any merit. I am reminded of a statement that Schoenberg made that his music is not modern, it is badly played.The major problem is with the chorus. I have heard high school ensembles that have performed with more polish. The quality of their sound is anemic, their intonation is off in places and their entrances are frequently ragged.Although most of the instrumental playing is good, there are some rough spots.Too bad, this work probably deserves better."
2,Over priced. Short on actual Corpsmen content.,"As a former Hospital Corpsman (HM3 67-70). I was not impressed with this book at all. There are a total of 96 pages in the book. Pages 1-48 do a fine job of telling the story of the History of Hospital Corps. But then on page 49 it stops and from page 49 to 90 the book is filled with list of our Brothers who will never come home. With all respect to our fallen brothers in arms. This information can be easily found on the Internet. I ordered the book, because I thought it would for the most part filled with stories about or from former Corpsmen. Not to be half filled with KIA information that has been available to anyone interested in finding out this information on the internet for years. I am not taking away from ""Our Brothers"" who will never come home, but if an author want to write a book about Corpsmen, let it really be about Corpsmen."
2,Hawk flies under the bridge,"Somewhere on the liner notes I read: ""this is not just schlock but [something positive, can't remember what they said it was]. Well, it IS schlock, Coleman Hawkins with strings, recorded I think in 1956; I don't have the thing in front of me, it's buried somewhere I don't usually look, though I didn't GIVE the thing away, as I didn't want anyone to be turned off Coleman Hawkins.Remember the recordings Bird made with a string & oboe orchestra? Well, imagine the orchestra and its arrangements sounding much worse, with Parker really drunk and really bored, and you'll have some idea of what this outrage sounds like. I don't think Hawkins was drunk, the impression is more like Ralph Nader being interviewed by MTV or Fox.I've given it an extra star because Coleman Hawkins really IS on it, it's not false advertising.One of the worst records I've ever heard filed under ""jazz""."
5,One of the Best of all time Vocal groups,"I sincerely believe because their career was so short, that many people that heard them years ago mistakenly remember them as the Manhattan Transfer. They were at least as good: I Think better, and I'm a Transfer fan. This album is my favorite of the three they made, not a throw away track on it. ""Sugar"" may be the best version ever recorded. Consider what you think you would pay for one your top 10 all time favorite jazz albums and then reconsider the prices asked. With all the other reviews depicting the great arrangements, etc., I won't rehash any of that. Just remember this is rarified air and if you get a chance to listen, stop everything else and do so! I wish they would reissue digitally as well, but until then..."
5,A Hidden Gem,"Of the hundreds of CDs & cassette tapes that I own, this is easily one of my favorites and one that I never get tired of hearing. I has the rare ability to stay fresh."
5,Marvelous arrangements,I bought this CD back in 1984 because 1) it was cheap -I recall it went for 10 Dutch guilders which used to be US dollar 5- and 2) the Brecker Brothers played on it.Great album. Marvelous arrangements of jazz classics and crystal clear voices. I like sugar on this CD even better that Turrentine's original version.This CD should definitively be re-issued.
2,I RETURNED IT,"Forgive me for being dense; I own a number of hiking books, and I found the layout of this book hard to understand (reminds me of ""Guide to the Colorado Mountains""). I'm not a climber, I'm a hiker (though I love long, difficult hikes), and I also found the Roach rating system confusing. Though I very much want another book with higher mountains in Colorado in it, I either need to take a class to learn how to use this book or buy one with a layout I prefer: individual hikes up peaks, round trip mileage and altitude gain included, and without having to do multiple cross-referencing to figure out routes and distances."
3,It's small -- really small,"I got this for my wife. She liked to watch ""Sex and the City"" and was drawn by the brand name.I wouldn't recommend it -- at 0.17 oz. it's just too small. If you're a man, you'll look like a cheapo. If you're a woman, you'd probably want to sample it in person first anyway. And if you're a repeat buyer, you're probably not reading this review anyway."
4,Depending on how you define a sopranist...,"This is a very good CD. The program is well suited to Raunig's voice and his performance is very strong. What I found slightly strange, however, is the extent to which Arno Raunig's voice sounds like that of a boy soprano (rather than that of a countertenor or a woman.) Overall, however, I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Classical period."
4,Review by (female) soprano student,"This recording is valuable for two reasons. Firstly, it covers rare but very worthy repertoire and secondly, it displays the curious voice of Arno Raunig. While I don't find Raunig's voice particularly beautiful, he has a very fine sopranist technique, despite a tendency to belt out top notes. The highlight of the recording is his high C! at the end of the Alleluja from Mozart's Exsultate Jubilate. He performs the arias without the preceeding recitatives, which is a shame especially since the recit. to 'Cara lontanano ancora' is so fantastic. He also avoids trills wherever possible, including the virtuosic beginning to the beforementioned aria. Nevertheless, his spectacular range, accurate intonation and energetic singing ensure this recording is a welcome addition for countertenor and opera seria fans."
4,temenos,"The actual author of this text is John Weir Perry. John Beebe wrote the introduction. Anyway, this book is an excellent expose on the language of the psyche and how it produces symbolic images that are part of the healing process. Symbolic and abstract forms do not relate well to concrete thinkers, but the psyche keeps producing these images anyway. For those who who can and prefer to work with the symbolic life, there might be more here in this book than someone else's madness. This book is a good illustration of the symbolic healing process."
4,buyer and composter; filters work with my kitchen compost pail,"I have the pail,Exaco trading ECO-2000 that uses these filters sitting in my kitchen in Texas where the high temps are reaching beyond 100 and they leave no smell. My house is at @ 80 so it is not all that frigid.The filters work well, but I find them to be pricy for the length of time I am to change them out. I am looking for this kind of material that I can cut my own. Seems simple enough."
5,Bad experience turned good,Another reviewer for a compost bucket stated that if I ordered the extra filters I would be glad. Since the company quickly sent me the filters and they seem fine. However the bucket which would have come from Amazon with free shipping was soon cancelled after which I believed I actually bought the filters for nothing. I will probably buy the bucket directly from the company that sent the filters since they were nice enough to offer it to me with free shipping after my experience with Amazon. So I will be buying my future filters from this company.
3,Just a head's up . . .,". . .more than a review. This is a good movie. To me, Kevin Spacey opens a film. His performances make even a mediocre film worth watching (and owning on DVD). The story is good, and not everything can be another ""Se7en"" or ""American Beauty."" Nevertheless, if you are a Spacey fan, check it out.But my real reason for posting a review was to give the head's up to any Colin Farrell fans out there . . . he's been getting a following lately, and the DVD tries to jump on that by putting him on its cover. If that entices you to pick it up as you are fresh from seeing his stellar performance in ""The Recruit"" or want more of his hometown accent that was offered as Bullseye, you will be sorely displeased. Mr. Farrell has no more than 5 lines in the film."
4,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","Ordinary Decent Criminal brings to the screen the story of an Irish gangster (robber/thief) whose schemes provoke the wrath of both the IRA and the police.The movie is action packed and very witty, while the acting is excellent.Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!The rating could have been PG-13, as there's no serious reason really for an R rating.In short, it's a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might want to stop short of buying it.Strongly recommended for those with a soft spot for Ireland and all things Irish!"
3,Quite Interesting,"I'm not going to put it down at all, I thought it was a good movie. I understood that he was that criminal mastermind, you know, and granted, Kevin Spacey plays a good bad guy (wow, what a weird oxymoron) and his reputation proceeds him. He is remarkable as he plays a fellow man who has two wives and kids, does his job for flamboyancy and reputation rather than the profit or payment; though he has quite a dark side to him at some points. He makes the movie, hands down. I think the accents were all right but apparently they weren't Dublin, as the audiences on youtube have often proclaimed but a mix of American, Swedish, Scottish, and British. But nevertheless, good movie (and for you Kevin Spacey fans, like myself, I would definitely give it a lookie). ;))))"
2,Spacey must have had a double!,"Spacey's character moons the press near the start of the movie. However, the moon was hairless and curvy. In ""American Beauty,"" Spacey showed that he has a nice posterior, but it was hairy and a bit flat. Like Kevin Costner and Val Kilmer, Spacey must have added to the list of Hollywood actors who wimp out of nudity. He is not as brave as Harvey Keitel, Ewan McGregor, or Jude Law. What a shame coming from a man who is usually so edgy in his work."
3,Waste of time for non-Spacey fans.,"I rented this movie solely because I'm a huge fan of Kevin Spacey, and as such, I was pleased by some of the film. But its unnecessary length, its poor plotline that never seemed to get anywhere, and the strange atmosphere of the film (which ranged from tragic to light-hearted, cancelling out any real message) were simply too overpowering to make this a good movie. Plus, the ratio of time on a motorcycle to time developing a plot was probably 8:1. I know it's a true story, but some true stories just aren't worth telling, and this might be one of them."
3,"Ehh, whatever.","I got my hands on a copy of this film last year after months of hunting and persistence. I was a little disappointed after seeing it. There were quirky parts and typical Kevin-Spacey-good-times. But the result left me in a question mark stage. Not sure if this film is for the average Joe looking to see a flick, but it is semi-pleasing for any Spacey fan."
1,I am giving it to Salvation Army thrift store,"Eek.Slightly disgusting to begin with (two adoring wives to one husband and they don't even compete?) and really disgusting at the end (Spacey's character suddenly becomes really violent, including shooting people in the back.)Neither comedy nor drama, this movie is somewhere in between never really fully anchoring in any particular genre. Perhaps the movie was supposed to be ironic but at the end our reaction was: Huh? What's the point?"
1,This movie is a crime,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The original movie ""The General"" was a great movie. Which only make it more difficult to understand how Miramax could have made such a bad movie.This is a ""Keystone Cops"" style of movie. Do not expect to see a believable or likable character in the movie, only slapstick comedians in laughably bad staged scenes. If you want to see the real version of this movie get ""The General"", not this appalling version."
2,"Spacey moons the camera, then the movie gets mooned","starts off as Spacey's moons the cameras and people and then goes on with a boring pace and the worst part is that Colin Farrell has little screen time in this one and gets killed as hes shooting from behind a painting, what the hell. Fiorento has a good British accent but the story is to dumb and Spacey's friends and the cops are obnoxious, but Farrell was mute maybe for most his part. for Spacey or Farrell fans"
3,"HE'S A GREAT, GREAT PLAYER","This Bluebird compilation appears to be the digital version of an earlier vinyl release. There's one important difference, namely that five more tracks have been included. The tracks span the period 1928 to 1957, and some of the earlier selections inevitably duplicate other releases (Eddie's Hot Shots, and the Mound City Blue Blowers sides being the most obvious). Sound quality is not as good as that of the Living Era reissue, sounding more muffled and constricted."
4,Discover more abt Linda Darnell,"Knowing very little abt Darnell, this was an eye-opener and another of those ""can't-put-down"" reads...it's all there: how she was pushed around by almost every one at Fox AND in her personal life...ending in a most horrific ""accidental"" death."
2,Modules Die Qucikly,"I purchased this system (along with 1 laser module) for a small 2.5g aquairum.I set it up quickly and the effect was very nice. However soon after setting it up I had one module die, after returning it I had another one die, and bought a new one only to have it and the exchanged one die. I then contacted the company who was nice enough to send me 2 replacement modules free of charge, but after a few weeks both of thoes died (this whole time I had one blue module which had been working since the day I installed the system). I pretty much gave up at this point and just left the one module in place, which eventually died after a couple more months.I put quite a bit of money into the system, and at this point have the power adaptor and a large collection of dead modules."
1,Very cool but didn't last long,I bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and didn't lit on; i didn't matter because they look beautiful underwater... one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too; i replaced the beams but they stop working days later. it's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium. (unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks).
5,"girls are geeky, too!","The Eighties are over - and women actually dominate the Web industry, and have penetrated many high tech fields once the sole territory of men. The HTML style brackets could also double for PHP or another scripted language. Geek is as geek does. Get your sweet geek a treet with this feminine-cut shirt that let's her announce that the computer playing fields are equal. She's a geek - hear her click."
5,good resource for teachers and performers,"Contents pages organized according to scale, tonic, mode, feel. Lots of pentatonic music. Song games with instructions. Includes Spanish and Native American songs. Bibliography, discography, title index, classification index."
5,More than your money's worth,"I own several computing dictionaries because I began to collect them as a hobby, so long as the price was acceptable (low). The referenced, dictionary covering the computer industry in general, was the first purchased. The book is not full of fluff and filler. All subsequent computer related dictionaries had to meet or exceed it's standards. None has. This is an wonderful dictionary for the professional or novice computer user. You will begin to rely on it if you are either a casual or intense computer user, programmer, network user, preparing for a certification, or just ""playing around"" with a computer for grins or games. Without any hesitation I recommend this book. My only regret is that an update does not seem to be in the plans. The available edition, in and of itself, cannot keep up with such a dynamic industry and it is beginning to show its age."
5,A disturbing book of wisdom,"I picked this book up yesterday and I could not put it down. In fact, I finished it off before I went to bed. Dino's prose (along with the translator's skill) invoked the unease of desolation in the beginning of the book, and much later a similar desolation in a different setting. I felt the uncertainty and excitement of the characters when they saw unidentified things in the distance.Dino's ability to keep me interested aside, this book gave me a feeling of uneasiness about my life itself. I am still quite young, and I fear the postponement of the great things in my life now more than ever. Occasionally Dino steps outside of the events of the fort to describe youth and the process of aging in a haunting way.I'll be sure to keep this book around to read again on a lazy afternoon."
5,A Masterpiece,I never understood why the book never made it in the Anglo-Saxon world. Il deserto is one of the 20th century's masterpieces.
5,A brillant and haunting existentialist fable,"This one stays with you and haunts you. If you read it when in youth, and then reread it midway in your life, then you'll be stunned by the depth of its truth. And it's almost relentless in its hoplessness, very hard to read because you know you are reading about yourself, in fact about everybody around you. And you cannot quit reading no more than you can stop breathing or hoping that this is it, that at last on the horizon (of your life)...There is something even more hopeless in Buzzati than in Kafka, because it is less fantastic, closer to home, truer to human experience.""The Tartar Steppe"" is, to my sensibility, a great (little known) masterpiece of the 20th century Italian and European literature."
5,Welcome to Staggerford,"It is my misfortune to discover many of our finest contemporary writers some 15-20 years after they've begun publishing. Better late than never in such cases as Jon Hassler, who travels in much the league and genre of J. F. Powers and Garrison Keillor. Hassler's voice and craft, however, are all his own, and they are a delight. ""Dear James"" is my introduction to his oeuvre; I look forward to reading much more."
2,She had an answer for every single question,"The intro was great ....thanks David Icke!However, your witness ...it was waaaaaaaay too long, and she wasmaking up the facts as she went along, rather than admitting she didn't know the answer, or would need to get back to Icke later on.She had an answer for every single question ...when did that happen, that there is no question a witness cannot handle ?Then the witness, goes into detail about menstruation, urination, defecation ...she has a fetish about excrements that is unhealthy and is a sign of having failed to outgrow the 2 year old Freudian struggle between egomania, Nascism (loving everything about yourself, including your pee and sh*t) vs. lack of self-esteem (not loving your own self, your merits, work, etc.)Really childish lady at 45 years of age....What's this about Mengele the Nazi in Cali ?Or even ...30 mins talking about Lady Diana's car crash in 1998 ?This has no credibility whatsoever....but it was a good try, by Icke."
1,Risa's book is pure garbarge.,"Risa Lieberwitz has done it again. In this book, the tears aprat the legal system, when everyobdy knows she should just leave it alone. Lieberwitz has no concept of the law and is inept at interpreting the NLRB. One is left wondering how she mainatins her position at Cornell."
4,"easy listen', nice cover!","nice easy listening compilation on the highnote label. this is a lot like the 32 jazz label compilations and packaging. inexpensive, with a nice variety of music. Tricia Tahara with Wallace Roney and Lenny White, John Hicks, Winard Harper, Larry Coryell, Houston Person are a few names that contribute to this release. i highly recommend this cd if your looking for some quiet music to work or relax to. besides that, you got to love the cover..."
2,There are better ones of this kind out there...,"This kind of retro music, when slowed down, comes really close to MUSAK. Unfortunately, most of the tracks on this CD IS MUSAK. I had images of my dad playing this stuff on family vacations, driving the fake wood-paneled Ford Country Squire, all of us in the back turning green with motion sickness. Anyway, the two tracks I like the most are on another CD of the same genre called ""Beat at Cinecitta, Vol.I"" If you like your retro Italian erotic film music with a zippy groovier edge, get that one instead."
3,..Is this complete anywhere on dvd???,....I was hugely dissapointed in the Troma release of this film..I thought finally after paying more for company dvd with a little more prestige that the usual bargain bin varieties..I'd be getting a complete version of this film finally on DVD!...NOPE..all the nasty tidbits were cut!..the Head getting blown thru at the beginning in the Chinese opium Den..the more graphics aspects of the prison rape..the bucket of animal guts scene...the [...] scene in the Bar..the old man mooning the Bush Cop...even the mention of the word Scrotum!..All cut in the Troma Release!...I'm sticking with my old Thorn EMI VHS!!!!..I'm Pissed!..cuz I love this movie!
1,Wrong aspect ratio on Troma DVD transfer,"The film was originally shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. But this 2005 DVD release from Troma Entertainment presents the film in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio print cropped directly from the ""pan and scan"" full-screen print that was made for VHS releases. The film has never been seen in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio since its theatrical release."
3,Funky Cutting / Challenging Transfer,"Over the years, after seeing ""Mad Dog"" in the theater, I picked up various VHS versions and (now) DVD versions of this film. While the Troma version here is better than the worst, it's not a good transfer. More, I keep looking for a better edited version of the underlying elements. This Mora flic has always been choppy, but I keep hoping each new release will tell the tale with a bit smoother presentation. Nothing new here. Maybe this is as good as this low-budget flic gets? Perhaps Phillipe Mora could let us know sometime how close this cut is to his vision? Maybe the (somewhat) psychotic cutting style is the best way to communicate the story of this 'rebel-outlaw?' Hopper certainly fits the part; bursts of fury and anger fill the screen at times."
1,Bored,"I'm like watching this movie and its like I'm just bored or something. Its like it looks like a really bad transfer on DVD, bad picture quality, and like bad sound etc. The story is like not really that good and the movie is like totally slow and gets real boring like."
1,"2008 Region 1 , Mad Dog Morgan DVD","Unfortunately this is yet another poor quality release of the film.I was hoping for the best & it's just simply as bad as the worst. Yes it has some of the cut out scenes. But let's get real this whole marketing of the film because of a few edited scenes is so 1980's. It's not a horror film & it's not a porno!It's a great great ""classic"" film and hopefully somebody somewhere gets the original print and transfers it to a high quality DVD , for region one, in it's entirety including the prolog & narrations .Until then the best version of the film we can see in the US is on IFC channel."
3,A Good Overview for the Uninitiated,"Melissa Cook's work is best suited for the reader possessing little exposure to the overarching concepts concerning the use of modern information systems to support enterprise environments. Viewed from this perspective the book appears to be successful. The text covers several EA topics and issues in a simple, relatively non-technical manner. It also devotes, where possible, a portion of its space to the historical background concerning a particular topic.For the contemporary CIO or VP of information systems/technology who needs to wrestle with the demands of actually building an enterprise information architecture, the prospects for Cook's book may be different. Such readers may well want to search for texts that drill deeper into the issues and challenges to be faced when building or reengineering application architectures."
5,A great album lost of new wave,The Story of a Young Heart its one of the best album (firts time on CD)of A flock of Seagulls. Great songs and great hybrid synth-guitar group. One of the best new wave groups forever!!!!!!!!!!! Buy it now!
4,A Better Deal,Buy this and all of your imports on amazon.co.uk! I only paid $19.00 with shipping included for this CD. The shipping time is about the same as well. I don't know why it's that way but it just is. Take advantage of it.This album was released over 20 years ago and it was far from a hit. I won't bore you with my opinion of it. If you are interested in it you've heard it so you already have your own opinion.
4,Owner of a great CD!,"What a delight to now have a remastered version and expanded edition of, ""The Story of a Young Heart."" I bought the album way back when it first came out. It was a drastic departure from the 'gulls other material. It was more melodic, simplistic, yet complicated in that it was really a concept album that unfortunately the public never fell in love with. And, this remaster has an excellent sound to it. With ""Young Heart"" the 'gulls had reached a pinnacle in their craftsmanship. The songs were more accessible, readily easy to remember and that is what makes a great pop album. But ""Young Heart"" was more than just pure pop it had character that left me wanting more......and now...I have it. If your a 'gulls fan then this is well worth it."
5,Always Loved This Overlooked Gem,"I consider TSOAYH to be AFOS' greatest album. It's like their Sgt Pepper. I can find something to like in each song. Remember David is great to blast REALLY loud and rock the house and my favorite track. Never Again (The Dancer) is a great dance track. The More You Live, The More You Love pure pop perfection. Sadly, nothing AFOS did after this album was anywhere near as good. Enjoy this AFOS album -AFOS at their absolute pinnacle."
1,don't do it,"the most improtant thing on a product like this is the transmission. whats the point in having digital music that has fuzz in the background. not at all happy, you get what you pay for."
5,This book is better than the carvings!,"The carvings sit, unnoticed by most, on a shelf locked behind glass at the Yellowknife court house. Anybody who walked up and saw them would have no idea of their origin, would have no idea of the social history behind these lumps of soapstone (and one stuffed bird).Eber's book provides the link. I walked past these carvings virtually every day before reading Eber's book, barely noticing their existence. Now, knowing the stories behind them and the people behind them, I have a much greater appreciation.This book is a must for anyone interested in Inuit art or the social history of Northern Canada. Recommended highly."
1,Outdated and of little value,I found this book somewhat outdated. Even though it was well-written if was of little value. There are several other books of better quality.
1,Junk,"This was a cool Idea, But Impossible to get It on the I pod, then once you get it on it peels off when you put it in your pocket.,It offers no protection at all, only for looks. Not recommended"
2,El Cheapo Deluxe-o,"Bought this one for my daughter. (Obviously) Car charger broke the second I plugged it in and the chargers tip got caught inside the DS. I had to bend metal to get it out!!! It nearly damaged the charger port on our DS. The screen protectors are awesome. They don't interfere with stylus performance at all and they keep your screen from getting scratched. It also comes with a very cool little screen wipe thingy and a rubber coated game holder that can attach to the DS. Headphones are worthless. Super uncomfortable. No foam around the earpieces. Just hard plastic to stick in your ear. Fun. The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" really comes into play here."
4,travel kit,"Travel kit for grandchild for Ninetendo DS, granddaughter very pleased with present. Delivery prompt."
4,Great Price for Everything You Get,I was really happy with everything that was included in the kit! I had been shopping around and comparing this kit everywhere when I came upon this one at Amazon. This kit at Amazon was much cheaper than anything else that I had compared. Great choice!
2,sent it back,the pink is cute but the items look cheap so in sent it back and got nintendo official licensed accessories
4,moving moments for the Bach collector,"These cantatas will probably interestingly only Bach enthusiasts. They don't have the grand or highly intricate pieces of, say, a B minor Mass or St. Matthew Passion. Still, for the Bach collector, this CD is worth picking up. First and foremost in my mind is the rendering of the well-known soprano aria, ""Bete aber auch dabei"". Its tempo is taken considerably slower than I've ever heard; exceptional space and breadth is given to the notes; it's consciousness-expanding. The acute listener will breath more slowly and deeply while taking in the arches of this music. Overall the authentic style of performance is very good. Orchestral forces and singers accent well and are not anemic."
5,Mug,"I am SOOOOOO happy that i bought this tea mug! It's got such a different, yet very comfortable shape. I love drinking from it and it has quickly become my favorite cup. I'd recommend anyone to buy one!"
5,The Best of Times,"As another reviewer has stated, any anthology of Sandy Denny's music this concise can't cover her work. She represented and still represents the best of folk/pop/renaissance singers of her period, recording a catalog of breadth and depth unusual for such a short career.Still, for a 1-CD set this covers many of the high points. These are certainly some of her most accessible recordings; ""Listen, Listen"" and ""Tam Lin"" are my favorites on this CD. They are beautifully remastered.Fortunately for all of us, most of Ms. Denny's work has been transferred to CD, so this one might serve as a great introduction to her work for the uninitiated.To those of us old enough to remember, this music can serve as a joyful bridge to our more innocent youth. Incidentally, the music samples can be heard by clicking on the full box set."
2,epic fail,"i bought this as a replacement for my map sensor , but the rubber part or ring to prevent air from escaping busted just to get it on even though i put a bit of lube on the ring"
3,OK IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF ROOM,"I bought this tent for my 6 year old and she loved it. However, it is definantly BIG! This would work best in a home with a large full basement. My husband is 6'1 and the flags on it came to the top of his head. One side of the tent stayed bent. We could not fix this. We decided to return it and folding this thing back up took about half an hour. The instructions that come with it are not specifically for this tent either. Also when you open the door it pulls the tent forward dut to it's light weight."
1,WAY TOO BIG ! ! ! !,"I got this tent for my daughter, she is only a year old but she loves hiding places, so I thought she would like it. Well, it took up her WHOLE ROOM!!! So she didn't feel like she was hiding at all because it was huge. 10 seconds after we opened we know it had to go back, but it took forever to get the thing back in the ""handy carrying case"" And the directions for folding it back up were just a few pictures of some other shaped tent. NOT HELPFUL AT ALL! If you had older kids, had a space that could hold about a six foot square tent, and never plan on trying to put it away maybe this could work for you."
3,"Fun, but big.","This is definitely a great playtent, but only if you have a large space to put it in. The size was shocking when we first put it up - furniture had to be moved in order to accomodate for it's size. And forget about folding it back into it's case. I have had playhut tents before and have never had a problem with the wire structure being bent beyond repair.Both my 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter LOVE playing in this tent. Being as it is so large they can run around in it, have friends inside with them, and basically retreat into their own little house. We plan on keeping it stored in the garage (in it's flat state) and pulling it out for special occasions or popping it up outside when it's not raining."
5,VERY satisfied....,"I'm pleased to submit this review concerning my satisfaction with my recent online purchase. The entire experience was simple, quick, and convenient."
5,A Cut Above by Dave Breen,Dave Breen kept me in suspense the whole time. A must read for anyone who enjoys being lost in a great book!
2,Could be better,"My puppy liked this toy. It was not his favorite but he liked it well enough. However, after two weeks, he ripped the fabric portion. He is a big chewer, and this item is sold as something for puppies to chew on, so I expected it last a little longer than it did. I wish the fabric was a little more sturdy."
2,Couldn't go the distance,"I bought this toy for my two Labs thinking that it would be perfect for them to run with and chase and pull. It also looked perfect for my 4 mon-old because she's teething and the different surfaces of the toy looked perfect to keep her entertained. However, within 5 min my girl had successfully begun ripping the stitching apart, and eventually (with some help from my other Lab) had managed to rip the toy in two and begun to try to eat the stuffing that is inside of the cloth covered sections.All that holds this toy together is some very flimsy stitching and is clearly not meant for any dog whose chewing level is above 'light.'"
3,Shakespeare Synergy Micro Spinning Combo,"This is a nice little ""training"" combo. The casting trigger is great for small, ""rookie"" fishers. The only negative comment I have is that the gear ratio for the reel is too low. We use it to fish for snappers with a lure and the reel doesn't generate enough retrieve speed for the lure to work efficiently."
1,"Never received it, so can't review it.","Never received this item and seller never answered my emails, so this transaction is in contention. I have cancelled the order and expect Amazon.com to refund my money."
4,Pretty comprehensive. Quite worth the money.,I've just finished the first 3 chapters. So far the author has painstakingly explained all the concepts of a broad subject such as investments. Although the content is pretty much similiar to most of the textbook in the market i would say that the book is pretty good in terms of - girth of explanation.Considering that i am a software developer who's been working in the securities industry since 1999 this should have have been 'the book' for a beginner going into this industry. I particular liked the explanation and the technicallities of margin trading becoz i've received quite a cryptic explanation from my seniors and this book clarified everything.Can't wait to read somemore. Too bad there isn't an equivalent book on the securities market for the Malaysian Stock Exchange (KLSE)!
4,don't even tear into your early bus without a copy,for the price it should have color wiring diagrams as the original then i'd of given it 5 stars...you'll throw out the tattered copy of st.muir
5,Read this,"If you've ever been in a fundamentalist church, this is your book. It's detailed, well-written, and incredibly deep."
5,AWESOME!! I sing it all day long,'Sure Feels Real Good' has an upbeat tempo to it that just gets your body bouncing to it. I go around singing it all day long!! I can't help it. It is just plain fun feeling real good!!
4,Not up to King's best,"A Killing Night is the fourth Max Freeman novel by Jonathon King. Max leaves the Everglades to assist his lawyer friend, Billy Manchester, when crew members of a cruise ship have been threatened. However, his primary interest is in the disappearance of female bartenders because a fellow ex-cop from Philadephia is the main suspect. A Killing Night is not as strong a story as the Edgar-winning first novel, The Blue Edge of Midnight, or Shadow Men, the third one. Perhaps it is because King's descriptions of the Everglades in the earlier books suck the reader into the story so that you can feel the heat and humidity. King doesn't do as well with the city environments as he does with the wilderness. I'll still read King, and A Killing Night was good, just not up to his best work."
4,Night,Liked this novel. Continue to enjoy all of Jonathan King's stories and well fleshed out charcters.He just does a fantastic job.
4,Keep reading the King,I'm going to have to go back and reread these books because they are almost running together. I just can't get enough of King's characters and am reading too fast.
1,product not received,"I don't know, because I ordered this book over a month ago and have not received it yet."
2,Little Girl's dress falls off,"While I was specifically looking for this exact charm and was delighted to find it, I am less than thrilled with how long it has lasted. The pink little girls dress fell off of the gold girl charm in less than two weeks. While the charm still looks presentable and no one can tell unless they look really closely, it was a disappointment."
1,"Wagnerian soprano sings ""I've Got Music""","I bought this CD because I am fond of the ""Promenade"", and wanted a copy. So I took a risk on an album that did not have any tracks for me to listen to. Big mistake.The soprano soloist who sings in most tracks is clearly talented and classically trained. As wonderful as she might be in the role of Elsa in Lohengrin, however, it borders on ludicrous to have her singing ""I Got Rhythm"" with a big, operatic voice. It's almost unlisten-to-able. Which is a great pity -- the selection of songs is excellent, the production good, the backup quite nice, and the singer is very talented. These songs are just an inappropriate venue for her voice style."
4,Zesty Christian pop!,"In 1983, Summer teamed up with born-again producer Michael Omartian (Rod Stewart) to come up with a record of lightweight but fun pop songs. The record playfully explores a wide variety of songs - from the pop/rock feminist title track, to the Carribean flavored ""Unconditional Love"", and to some richly textured ballads like ""Tokyo"". Her born-again Christian themes are more apparent here than in other records, so you can either take it with a smile while you're dancing away or put on BAD GIRLS and remember Summer before she was born-again. END"
5,An Artistic Triumph!,"""She Works Hard For The Money"" was the first album to earn Donna both artistic AND commercial success. Long gone is the lady of the night image, in it's place is Donna as a regular working girl. Not only do the lyrics rival that of her first artistic statement, ""The Wanderer"", but it's pretty amazing musically as well. Everything from new wave to ballads are here with Donna's always beautiful voice at it's all-time peak. This is the album that ""Cats Without Claws"" tried to be, and the state-of-the-art production still sounds fabulous today. A must for any fan of Donna's or 80's music devotees."
4,Right on the money...,"Donna Summer's 1983 album was not only very ecclectic and a kind of departure from her previous style,but also a masterpiece of classy songwriting,showcasing her otherworldly vocal interpretations.Songs like the title track,'Stop,Look,and Listen','Tokyo',are among the best of the genre,belonging to a golden era in pop that yet has to be surpassed."
2,D. Summer worked too hard on this one,"This album represents the end of Summer's protracted farewell to disco between 1980 and 1983. Unfortunately, the end-product of this farewell isn't so pretty: although this album is actually a pure rock music project, most of its tracks aren't worth appreciating. I agree the best track is the title hit track ""She Works Hard For The Money"" - an excellent upbeat dance tune, a song that indeed drives home a point (that of a simple woman who works hard for her earnings, a womam whom fate and circumstance can hardy bring down). Second fares ""People, People"" - a superb upbeat and danceable track as well. Then we have the lovely, quiet, slow ""I Do Believe"" - its tempo picks up at the 2:25 minutes mark - D. Summer sings it alone.Attention reggae aficionados: you've got a treat in the form of ""Unconditional Love""!The rest of this album isn't recommended listening."
5,Well done!!!,Splendid overview of Ronald Reagan's life-long battle with communism. I've given this copy to several of my younger friends who didn't have the priviledge to know Reagan as president.
2,A disappointment,"Im a big Reagan fan and im interested in history so I thought that I would like this movie. Plus the trailer for it was really great, possibly the best trailer I have ever seen. But I was very disappointed with the movie. It felt a little more like a propaganda movie then a documentary. Its not as bad as lets say a Michael Moore movie but I felt that it was pushing its message too hard. Still I dont regret buying this movie only for its topnotch bonus material."
5,In the Face of Evil,"I had the opportunity to see an advance screening of this film in July 2004. This documentary is moving, powerful, and inciteful. The analogy of Reagan and the Cold War to the current global struggle is brilliant. The best 3 hours I've spent in a theatre. Don't miss it."
1,THE BIG LIE,Reagan' presidency was a sham. The press is so afraid of Reagans popularity they are still afaid to tell the truth about him. The Russian PEOPLE ( from the top to the bottom) ended the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a disaster and the Russian people walked away from it. Raganomics: cut taxes by 25% but did not cut middle-class programs to make up the difference. He went on the biggest borrowing binge in history. Congress autherized LESS money than Reagan asked for or his borrowing would have been even greater. Iran-Contra: he created his own secret government. Powers not given to him by our Constitution. He should have gone to prison. WHEN IS SOMBODY GOING TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THE REAL REAGAN?
4,Informative,"Overall, this was a very well done documentary. Obviously this is not a Hollywood production, and the maker's of this film had to work with a much smaller budget than a Michael Moore. The reason for only a 4 stars is that some of the archival footage wasn't cleaned up. Maybe they didn't have the funds for this. The Reagan speeches included are a plus. Would have like his 1st inauguration speech included. Would like to see more films/documentaries like this that are from a different viewpoint."
4,A Look at History,"For someone who was born in the 1970s and did not understand what was happening with regards to the cold war, this was a lesson on history. I learnt a great deal about courage in times of conflict. I like the spiritual tone of the narrator. Thanks for the etras - the speeches made by Mr. Reagan. This product is worth it's price.However I would not recommend this product for classroom instruction on history as it could be understood as being biased since it carries a proamerican / prodemocracy tone. This is a product for personal viewing based on individual choice and perspective."
2,Who cares whodunnit?,"This book is neither fish nor fowl! The stories are all short, predominantly silly & far from suspenseful. As far as writing whodunnits is concerned, Agatha Christie has nothing to worry about. History, it definitely is not! Whilst the authors do try to draw circumstances from true history, the links & threads in these stories are pathetically fanciful, bordering on the preposterous. There isn't a single story that gripped me or, in writing this review, is worthy of a positive mention. This book is neither history nor mystery. If you want either, or both, you can certainly do better than this."
4,One BIG Flaw,"I bought this unit from my local Best Buy and ended up returning it a week later. It was a great little machine but the only flaw (which was a big one for me [never travel with originals, leave them at home]) was that every time I played a movie backed up to a DVD+R disc it would play fine until the climax of the film. Then it would start to freeze, skip, and sputter. It did this on EVERY DVD+R movie I played in it. Now I'm searching for a similar machine that actually works as it is supposed to. It's a great unit if you never need to play DVD media backed up from a computer's DVD burner."
2,Dissappointed,"When I got the product the third disk titles were all in an asian looking language. I couldn't read a thing it said. Vendor took the item back, and gave me a refund, I was well satisfied with that...but wished he had had the one with all english, it looked like a good album."
3,Excelent item will not rust,"After spending money in multiple shower caddies that would rust after a couple of months of use, I finally found this quality product. Had it for more than six months and still looks nice as long as I clean up the soap that tends to collect because the lower basket has a tendency to hold water."
4,As caddies go...,this is looking like a winner for me. Still looking for the perfect soap dish but this comes very close. Top shelf is low enough to hold tall bottles well. Added 1/8 thick closed cell foam to the showerhead pipe to make the clip a bit tighter and reduce sway when I remove a bottle. Either way it is not wide enough to cause it to dump anything but if a bottle tips forward it causes the caddie to slide forward and potentially jump over the showerhead. The foam strip should prevent this. Looking at EVA foam for where the metal frame touches the wall to elimminate any potential wear on the tile where it touchs. For me this works well as I have added space between showerhead and handle for hanging washcloths or puff. With normal distance they would hang in the way of the handle.The shelves are riveted on so removing them to clean is not possible. I will update with use.
5,The Top Music in France 2006,"This is a great pop/rock/musical/variete francais album mixed with amazing classical vocals, acoustics, supported by a Baroque style base. This is the CD based on the musical that first showed at Le Stade de France in Paris to rave reviews. It is a great album to sing along to and for all those, like me, who follow the French music scene very closely, this is a must have. Top songs include: ""Ca Marche"", ""Un Geste de Vous"", ""La Vie Passe"", and ""Tant qu'on reve encore"".My personal favorites include all of the above plus, ""Contre ceux d'en haut"", ""Etre a la hauteur"", and ""Repartir"". Enjoy!"
1,DONT SUPPORT THIS RECORD LABEL! DONT BUY THIS DISC!,"I love Type O Negative with a passion, but Roadrunner sold this without the band actually wanting this out, that's why the ""Dead Again"" album is under a different record label, dont support the record label that bootlegged this off of them!"
1,NO reason for this.,"If you love TYPE O then you have most or all their albums. So why would you buy this??? And i thought the least worst cd was the best of TYPE O?? Don't but this cd, I didn't and never will."
3,"Good movie, awful DVD","I have a huge complaint about the transfer of this DVD. It is the worst I have ever seen - really unacceptable. I don't see how it ever got distributed in such a condition. Scratches, dust, and even cigarette burns are in every scene. After a while it starts to get really irritating. Hopefully someone will get a clue and spend the paltry sum to fix it up."
5,Perfect Movie and unperfect DVD version,"As many reviewers here, I happen to watch this movie through the TV without any high expectation. However, the movie proves itself to be such an excellent masterpiece that I immediately decide to buy a copy into my wonderful movie collection. The story, the sence, the actors/actress, the director, everything about the moive is made flawlessly.The only problem I have and strongly wish the distributor to fix is that the DVD version lost many very touching and romantic sences that impress me so much on TV.. I hate whoever did this to a wonderful movie. I searched every store in my local area to find out the VHS or other DVD version of this movie. But unfortunately get nothing. I do wish the distributor can give out a new version of this movie without any edition. Please keep those beautiful sences!!!"
5,Makes me cry,"You cannot watch this movie without crying. I've been obsessed with Robert E. Howard since I was ten years old and I have been to Cross Plains and seen his house. This film is wonderful as is the book on which it is based. I really wish morons would stop referring to Conan as a comic book character as he is a character created in the pulps of the thirties. Howard is one the truly great writers of the twentieth century and his poetry is unequaled. The mess that has been made of many of his characters is whats really barbaric(Kull the Conquerer, anyone?). See this film if you are fan of Howard."
5,Outstanding! A must have for REH collectors.,"The lives of eccentric writers like Howard or Hemmingway are often as interesting as the stories they write. Many people have written about the short life of Robert E. Howard, who seemed so out of place and at the same time so rooted in Depression Era Texas. This memorable movie tells his story more fully than it's ever been told before. The movie is at its best when its working through Howard's conflict between his passion for a ""larger than life"" existence vs. his inability to deal with every day problems. REH's stories like ""Tigers of the Sea"", ""Sower's of the Thunder"", ""Kull"", and the Conan stories gain a little depth when read with Howard's life in mind. Anyone interested in the mind of this tormented Texas writer will certainly appreciate this movie."
5,Engaging film!,"I just can't keep my mind off this unusual film. The lead characters are so well acted! I never knew the story behind Conan the Barbarian, and the eccentic, wild behavior of Robert Howard has me mesmorized. It's such a wonderful treat to find a film with as brillant a script as this one."
5,What a find!!,"I watched this movie only because Vincent D'onofrio was in it. And am I glad that I did. I had heard of Robert E. Howard and knew he was a writer, but I didn't know anything else about him. This film shows the depth and loneliness of a man who didn't fit in with the rest of the world; and then he meets a woman who begins to understand and to love him, but ultimately cannot be with him.Vincent D'onofrio gives a wonderful impassioned performance as Howard and Renee Zellweger matches him as Novalyne Price, the woman who befriends him. This film is well worth seeing and I recommend it to everyone. It also contains the most passionate kissing scene I have every seen in a movie. I had to rewind and watch it more than once. (Actually, it was quite a number of times!!).If you're thinking of watching or buying this movie: Go for It! But beware, you will need kleenexs at the end -- I did, and I never cry at movies."
5,Beautifully told story,"I was so caught up in this film that when the end came, I was literally stunned. Tremendous story, beautifully told."
2,Where's the rest of this film? 18 Minutes are missing!,"According to the Internet Movie database, the film that this DVD purports to show is 111 minutes long. According to the ""technical information"" on the left, however, this DVD is only 93 minutes long. What happened to the remaining 18 minutes of this film? This kind of truncation of a good film is as annoying as the dropping of the key final scene in the DVD of ""The Big Easy."" Columbia Tristar should know better than to offer only about 7/8ths of a film -- particularly a film as good as this one -- and try to pass it off as the whole thing. Because this film is otherwise excellent, it should be shown complete, and I will refrain from buying this truncated version until Columbia Tristar issues it complete."
1,Bosch MCM5200UC Food Processor,"The box within a box I received with the Bosch MCM5200UC Food Processor inside was received in good condition and timely. The plastic machine inside never functioned correctly once and the motor had rhythmic banging insided the housing. In fifty years of purchasing small appliances in area stores, I have never purchased such a poor quality product. Product like this contributes to a lack of confidence in shopping the internet."
4,Covers Many Topics,This book hit on many topics and is a good reference book to use throughout the various stages of your divorce. Touches on a wide variety of things and generally answers some questions you might have. Some advice in this book I did not see in other divorce books such as what to do about debt in both of your names. Outlines what to do about credit card debt in both names as well as mortgage debt in both names. Mortgage debt is harder to get out of your name even if your spouse is awarded the asset. You are both still liable for mortgage debt until it is paid off or refinanced. Even if your divorce decree says that your former spouse is responsible for paying it. Book tells you how to communicate with credit card companies in regard to protecting your credit.This book is worth reading because you will probably learn at least a few things you did not previously know.
4,Very Helpful,I found this book to be very helpful for both men and women. If you are a woman you should also getDivorceDivorce for dummies gives you a better understanding in what will happen during the divorce proceedings. And if you are a womanDivorcewill help you before you get to the divorce court. Divorce for dummies outlines what you can expect to happen when you are going through divorce in a very clear manner. It doesn't talk over your head.
3,divorce for dummies,Very basic but OK for first internet choice. Googling for divorce self help was overwhelming. lots of more specific books on google.
3,Pricey Rainbow Faucet,Service from Amazon was great. The product is overpriced by Jacuzzi. The installation was difficult as no screws were provided and the drill needed was an odd size. The black plastic base is visible from the side. It works well but not worth the price.
3,The enchanted castle,This book seemed like a good idea but my 17 mos. daughter ended up not liking it at all. I think the pictures are just not bold and colorful enough for toddlers and babies. The pictures are kind of busy and bunched together. Hard for a child to see what's going on. Really cute design but not much good as a book. More of a toy. Better for maybe 3 and up.
5,Extremely valuable resource,"I bought this book primarily because it was listed as optional for my legal studies class, let me tell you, it's fantastic.Very clear, thorough definitions for any word I've ever needed to look up, includes latin, technical jargon, with something that has been particularly helpful, definitions of lawyer slang.Also, the appendix includes very useful information on where to find more information, communication and legal research.I love it."
5,An escape from the stresses of the world!!!,"Viva le ""KID LOCO""I personally do not agree with French Nuclear Politics,But the French Connection with Cyberlounge,Cyberorchestral,Cybersamples is to be experienced by oneself.Any project by this artist is a must in any Music Collection...The works of Kid Loco suit any occassion beit,Fashion Parades,DiningMusic,CreativeBackgroundMusic,to lovemaking moods of Desire. Do your life a Favour,Buy some""KID LOCO""now!!!!!!"
3,"Not The Best, Not The Worst","I'll be the first to admit, I didn't buy the album for the music. I bought it for the people who are in the band. Overall, the music wasn't that bad. It tends to border the musical territory between country and rock. I found ""I've Had It All"", ""Talk About Love"" and ""Great American Dream"" to be rather catchy little ditties. As a whole, I found the album disappointing after hearing Michael Gauvin Smith's and Tom Groleau's work with the Mudhens, but I've heard things a whole lot worse."
2,From punk to metal,"I gotta give him credit for trying to do his own thing but this cd is just terrible. SOrry Peligro, DK was the best."
3,sex toy is cool art,Picture poems ala patchen. kennedy is a bad ass poet with bad ass images. very cool booklet. nice color. cool collectible.
5,A very grounded and heartfelt musical journey full of hope,"Few folk artists captivate me like Darryl has. Guitar technique combined with writing skills to match Jackson Browne, Shawn Colvin, James Taylor and perhaps even Joni Mitchell, left me with no option but to contribute to this artists humble goal of self sustenance through his honed art. Give this album a chance...it may just take you to places in your heart you didn't know existed."
3,SweatVac Cap,"Service was fine, but cap is a sloppy fit with corners sticking out. I wear it on my no-helmet bike rides for increased visibility, but stash it in a pocket otherwise because of the goofy look."
1,Overcharging of shipping,The seller charges $8.95 for shipping a 5 ML bottle of cologne. The actual total on the shipping package was only $2.22. That is a great discrepancy. For this reason I will not recommend this seller nor will I purchase from them in the future.
4,"It takes a steady hand,","but overall met my expectations. Once these corners are on the page they are not budging. I purchased to use for scrapbooking larger items and brochures, which the standard small photo corners really can't hold in place. I had previously used a Scotch product that is apparently no longer available in the US, but can be found in Canada and the UK at a premium price. This Lineco product fit the bill."
1,Something you should know before ordering.....,"Description title says that they are mylar framers corners but they are not, instead I was sent polyester framers corners."
2,"Dearly, Nearly, Insincerely",A little too simplistic as well as not quite clear enough on the kinds of questions adverbs can answer.
5,Free --to do as I please!,"I loved it. I bought this and Argent, which was also great. This one takes each member of the band and shows how they contributed to the band individually. It gives some great examples, actual and demonstrated. Mainly of Paul Kossoff's incredible licks, which just seem to flow from him, but also of Paul Rodgers vocals, Andy's bass and Simon's drumming. An all around view of rocks all but forgotten powerhouse. We all know what happend next. Play on, Mr. Kossoff. We miss you!"
2,Too much critical retrospective--not enough music. . .,"I wish I could agree with the previous reviewer, but I cannot. There are some wonderful clips/segments of the band, but was ruined by the responses and constant bantering of the writers, journalists and critics. The producers of this DVD did not take into account that maybe--just maybe--the viewer has enough musical/critical/common sense to distinguish the contributions of Rodgers, Kossoff, Kirke, and Fraser. If I wanted a rehash of Kossoff's drug problems, all I had to do was research the material myself. The rare live radio performances would have been so enjoyable if there wasn't the bantering throughout.The bonus tracks were enjoyable because there wasn't any commentary throughout the performances--thank goodness!So--should you purchase the DVD? It depends on what you are looking for in a Free retrospective. I received it as a gift for Christmas--and am highly disappointed with the content."
3,This book was good,"This book was good for basic control theory. Now, it released the 4th edition. This is the 3rd edition. I bought this edition because this was cheaper than the new one."
2,Not that good..,"I studied control engineering over a distance learning course with this book. Much of it was self study. We used this book. Personally I found that this textbook was not good for self studying. Reading through the text, I found that Ogata had a tendency to skip over certain things when explaining concept. Most of my fellow classmates did not find it useful either. So I think this is definitely NOT a good textbook to use for self study."
2,"Buy a New One, Do Not Believe in The Used Books Comments","Hi all,The book itself is excellent but the used copy, which i bought ,was bad.Most of the book is highlighted by marker ;moreover most of questions were solved by pencil , but some were solved by pen."
2,Not one of his better albums,"Elvis should never have attempted ""Hey Jude."" He sounds like he's straining and he gets the words wrong, repeating the same stanzas over and over again! Dreadful! But, there are a few gems on this album that redeem it. Elvis does a great version of Gordon Lightfoot's ""Early Morning Rain"" as well as ""Help Me Make it Through the Night."" Unfortunately, the rest of the album is largely forgettable. If you want a good representation from the 70's, try one of the later greatest hits packages or if you're looking for individual items, try ""Today,"" ""Promised Land"" or ""Moody Blue""."
1,DISSATISFIED--DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,I ordered a CD on 12/17/04. I NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM. I have sent 3 inquiries to this seller and no reply as of 1/13/05. I am very dissatisfied with this service. I do not recommend this seller nor Amazon.com. Very poor service.
1,"Cheap looking leather for the price, ""faux"" faux leather","Leather looks like the type you would see in an airport shop, or maybe one of those monogram it stores in the mall. It could have fooled me into thinking it wasn't even leather at all. Didn't live up to the price. Was an embarrassing gift at Christmas, but what can you do when you order on the 21st? Wish I had had time to return it and get something better."
5,It's very nice,Got this for my bf for the long winter here. He said it's warm and comfortable and wears it all the time.
1,Terrible product,I've always bought dearforms in the past and have always been satisfied until this time. Both slipprs ripped in the same spot within three days. Last time I buy this type of slippers!!
3,Comfy but a little flimsy for active folks,"Two notes. 1) A previous reviewer wrote they run big, so I ordered 10 instead of my usual 11 (I wear 10.5). They were too small. Go figure. 2) I gave them to my son, who separated the fleece from the sole within weeks. The tops are glued to the rubber bottoms. Not very strong. Probably OK for casual wear, but if you run around the house in them (as my son does), they will likely fall apart real soon. I later purchased a pair of Acorns. Their tops are stitched to the sole, and are good for years (I have one pair that is still intact after about 8 years!). I'd highly recommend a pair of Acorns instead for active wear."
5,One BIG Platter,"This is great for entertaining. My problem is storage. It is so big that it doesn't fit in any cabinet. It is now just on top of my refrigerator (no fiestaware should be reduced to being on the fridge having misc. ""stuff"" thrown on it :). I like the other reviewer's idea of using it as art. It's beautiful and still worthy 5 stars, but consider storage before you purchase."
3,Read a Modern English version first,"Unless you are versed in M.E,you may want to read or re-read The Knight's Tale in Modern English before listening to this. Otherwise it may be rather difficult to follow; in fact, it probably will be anyway, although pieces of it should be comprehensible. No one really knows what M.E. actually sounded like, as those pre-Luddite Middle English obdurately refused to record their spoken language. Towards the end, having pretty much given up on parsing the interpretation, I got a bit ear-weary, but carried on with it to the end. Fun, of a sort."
2,This product didn't work at all!,"I had high hopes that I could use this product on a previously untreated oil stain on my driveway of unsealed brick pavers. It really didn't work! I followed the directions, but only had enough product to treat one time (the directions say if it doesn't work the first time, to scrub it the second time). One of the tips is that it needs to be used in warm weather to work - well I live in Florida & it barely lightened the oil stain at all! Save the money to pay a professional!"
2,Didn't remove a thing during cold weather,"I tried this product on some stubborn stains in my garage. I am thinking that the floor was too cold, probably about 40.I will try again after the floor warms up this spring/summer and hope it does something to remove the oil stain.Very expensive little bottle."
3,Removed most of the 30 day oil stains for about 75%,Removed most of the 30 day oil stains for about 75%. I could definitely see improvement but honestly expected the not so old stains to be entirely removed. 32oz removed about 10-12 stains instead of the 15+ I was expecting and hoping for.
1,Thus product used to work,This used to be a excellent product but they changed the formula. Since they changed their formula it is a runny milk like solution that is worthless.
1,Don't waste your money,"Was a great product for years. Recent change in formula renders it a failure. It used to be nice and thick, worked great. Now it's like spending $15 on a quart of milky water. Avoid."
1,Product has changed!!!!,"I completely agree with other reviewers that this product has changed. I use to use this product for oil stains in my garage (concrete) from working on cars. It used to be amazing stuff...it would get out oil stains from years before.The last two times I have used this product it pours out like water (even after shaking)....while it used to be very think, almost like a milkshake. Since this change, it doesn't even pick up oil completely on fresh stains.I will be looking for another product in the future to help remove oil stains from concrete!"
1,lousy new formulation,"the old formula smelled like oranges and worked beautifully--very rarely did i need a second application, and once it was dry i simply swept it away easilythis new stuff smells like lestoil and will not wipe away--it is as if i applied white paint to my driveway paversthe company ruined a great product"
4,Works to remove motor oil; leaves white film,"I recently spilled some motor oil (dark brown color) and really looking for ways to clean them up. All reviews and recommendations from Internet led me to Pour-N-Restore.I'm happy to say that it was able to lift the stain off. I followed instructions of doing it in the daylight with sun in the heart of California winter (60-65F during the day, 50F at night).After cleanup, I don't see the stain anymore but there I get traces of white film. Hopefully it'll disappear over time.Note on large surface: be prepared to spend a lot of money! per the instruction one 32oz bottle covers a circle of 3 feet in diameter!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I bought this receiver for two reasons: it had 3 component inputs and the THX rating.First, I had to purchase a $20 3way component switch becuase the one in this reciever is junk. It has too much loss and my screen goes blank when I use it.Second, I never use the THX becuase it doesnt sound as good as the dolby settings.So basically it sucks and I would give it 0 stars if it were an option. Also, the customer service sucks too. They wanted me to send it in to get worked on. My unit was not the problem. I bought one from BB and it did the same thing. No refund..so now I'm stuck with this piece of trash."
5,"? for Russell (New Orleans, LA)","Would you be willing to sell it? I have a pair of 1015s bi-amping 7 JBL E100s; that's 28 drivers in total (not including the two channel sub-woofer system). Sweetest system that I have ever put together. One of my audiophite buddies with a $15K system, could only look down at the floor as he walked out to the room. I'd be willing to take your ""piece of junk"" off your hands. Repost if your interested and I'll respond with an email address."
1,VSX-1015TXK (predecessor) Broke 1 week after 1 year Warranty -$430 wasted!,I bought the near-identical product recently (VSX-1015TXK). Multi-channel (Hi-Fi Audio - my favorite feature) broke 1 week after the 1 year warranty was up - a waste of money/time!Don't buy this product unless you have $400+ to throw out the window!
3,DAC in this receiver is not the best chip.,"I think this model is a high cost performance model.MCACC is covenient and has enough quality.BUT I don't want to buy this model, want an upper class model.Why?Because 7-channel DACs(digital to analog converters) in this modelis not the best ones.Upper class models utilize Burr-Brown(Texas Instruments)'s good DACs.If you want enough sound quality, you should buy upper class models."
5,For the price it is greatest.,"If your buying it for HDMI remember it's pass-thought only.I still had to connect optical cables for audio on all source devices. I knew that and didn't mind. The Automatic MCACC is the greatest. Setting up the input devices was easier than my last pioneer.Manual was very good!Note: I have had pioneer's since the 70's, but this one is the best I have had for the price.You can find it a little cheaper at CC than here, but shipping here was fast for FREE ground shipping.Walmart had the best price for the HDMI cables. I am notgetting sucked into MONSTER (prices) cables."
4,"Good system, minor inconveniences","Overall a good system so far, however the instructions are not very clear and can be confusing (even for an engineer). The design of the speaker wire connections on the back of the receiver are a nightmare for bare wire speaker cables. You practically have to stand on your head to get a secure connection."
5,Fabulous Workout,"I have been working out for 29 years. I have taught yoga, dancercise and aerobics and am constantly looking to challenge my body. Rachel McLish's workout is a fabulous workout that was put together with great knowledge and thought. This workout tones and sculpts the muscles, leaving you with a tight firm feeling, which I love. Rachel is truly my icon, she is beautiful, classy and intelligent, I hope we will be seeing another workout by her."
2,This exercise video was too slow paced,"I have been exercising regularly for 20 years and have worked out with weights somewhat regularly during this time. I have been doing 'The Firm' for the past 3 years, and I found that this video was not challenging enough. It was slow paced. There was no warm up and very little cool down. I did not feel that I had a good work out when the tape was complete. I was disappointed. If you are used to doing weights and are just looking for another good weight workout for variety, this tape might not be the best for you!"
5,The Real Thing,"I got this tape after a year and a half training with a body building champion. (He was the champ -- I was the average gal who had always wondered if I had a great body under there somewhere -- I was surprised to find I did.) I had moved and wanted to keep up my good work. It does not get better than this. It is safe, precise and targeted. One of the previous reviews mentioned that 8 pound weights (which Rachel uses throughout) were too light -- my opinion is that if they are too light, perhaps the exercises were being done too quickly, or carelessly involving muscles other than the specifically targeted muscle. Of course, the reviewer could just be really strong! For the more petite among us: I got very ""cut"" and rarely go above 5 pound weights! I definitely suggest doing upper body one day, lower body another day. There are variations so you can modulate the moves to fit your particular issues.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
3,"This is not his best, Luismi could have done better","Luismi has a voice of GOLD. We all know that. We all know he is the best singer in the world and he is the hottest latin superstar there is. Because of that, I think he could have done better. The song sounds rehashed to me, it reminds me of his ""Nada Es Igual"" material.I think he could have gotten a better song to record. He's vocals are top notch. Even if I call Luismi my favorite performer in the world, I am having to ""work"" at REALLY loving this song. His ""Romances"" cd was so much better. And the radio edits are not very good. If he wants a more danceable song, he needs to get some producers that work with dance music to do his remixes."
5,Good song,"I consider this a very nice song which has a nice mixed of metals and guitars, and also when they are combine with Luis Miguel's voice it transforms to a wonderful song. I give to it 5 stars because is so LuisMi."
1,Just awful,"I love film theory and I love Kubrick's films. So I bought the book on an impulse at the book store. Many PhD's have this thing where they take weird observations and dress them up in words with many syllables all the while going in nonsensical circles in remarkably hubristic ways. This book is a perfect example of that type of writing. I tried starting in different places but they all made me cringe. Were Kubrick alive I think he would be quite amused by this stuff, and you know, in the bad way. The book is in the running for worst book of my life. There are many wonderful books on Kubrick and his films, and chances are ANY one of them you can find is better than this. Sorry!"
1,Only if you are a true Kubrick fan,"I was so so offended by the slackness and cheekiness of this book that I absolutely had to write a review... The writing style is so bad it will make your head spin like a top. The sentences run on forever, and Professor Nelson can't seem to keep to a point at all. He spends most of his time impressing himself instead of trying to communicate with readers. Don't bother with this one unless you are a true Kubrick diehard."
4,Haven't has a miss yet!,"I've had this book for a year now and have made 15 recipes from the book. Not one of them has been anything less that stellar. This has become my ""go to"" seafood book.Favorites include Grilled Scallops with Pancetta and Basil Aioli, Grilled Rosemary Trout, Cedar planked Char and Zesty Lemon Trout. These have all been repeated.I only took a star away because I like cookbooks with pictures.I also wish sustainability would have been addressed but that's just me. There are some recipes for fish like Orange Roughy which are on the ""avoid"" list. Please check Seafood Watch at [...] before selecting your fish."
4,Yummy-Sounding Sauces and Marinades,"I bought this for my friend in Florida who practically lives on grilled fish. Of course,I went through it thoroughly before wrapping it up and passing it on to her.There are so many types of fish in this book that I very much doubt that most of us would ever have the opportunity to find them all unless you have an exceptionally good fish store in your area.I think the real value is in the sauces and marinades. You may not have access to monk fish, but you may like the sound of the sauce/marinade for your grouper/mahi-mahi/bass or whatever. There are lots of recipes for side dishes, too.This book is jam packed with wonderful new ideas to get you out of your rut. And who's to say you have to use the barbie if it's 20 below outside or you live on the 24th floor?"
2,Fans robbed,"Why do music companies insist on giving the finger to fans by re-releasing classic albums with tracks that are edited from the original 12"" versions? In this case I Love You 12"" is an edited, shortened version from the original 12"". Fans buy these re-releases, and fans are going to be the ones that notice these things.Thanks for doing this :-("
3,Lot of rust,Had a few months now and it's quite rusty. Still better than plain steel. I thought stainless steel wouldn't be covered in rust.
4,Shiny-no more.-updated,"It's a little smaller than the ones I've had in the past, but if it lasts longer I'll get over it. Appears to be well made. I miss the bale handle found on the Weber brand. April 24th the bottom fell out. So much for long lasting. Rivets in the handle are getting loose too. I'll get out the drill and rebuild it like I have done in the past. But that was after at least 2 yrs. of use. Don't buy this chimney. Stick with Weber."
4,"a lot of ""arts & craftiness"" for the $$$",it takes a while to assemble and finesse the shade to hang correctly...and make sure the tabs that hold the mica panels in place aren't visible...BUT for this price it's worth it. you get what you pay for.
4,good product reasonable price,We received the ink cartridge in great condition in a speedy amount of time. We are happy with the service and will definitely order this product in the future.
1,Misleading,"Despite crediting Dave Mustaine as a cowriter, there is actually only a few pages written by him. Most of the information is recycled from magazines and the author has little in the way of original content."
5,Excellent read,"This book is just cool. Loved it. Joseph does a great job of telling many stories that would have never been heard.. If you're a follower of God and a rock' n' roll fan, read this book."
3,Decent book for the subject at hand,"I was intersted in this as a Christian who likes decent music. I was familiar with about 90% of the artists featured, but I did not really learn anything new about them. The highlight was having Mustaine write the introduction. Otherwise it was so-so. I would say this is good for parents of kids into music though."
2,Too much is taken from other sources.,"If you have paid much attention to Christian music publications from the last decade or so you have already read a large portion of this book. It's not that it simply says the same thing, rather some of the artists sections are the exact same interviews that I had previously read in HM or the like."
2,Slightly Cheesy Beginning to Classic Sc-Fi Comic,"This untranslated story arc is episode 1 of the long-running French comic strip ""Valérian, agent spatio-temporel."" ""La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes"" [The City of Moving Water] and ""Terre en Flammes"" [Earth in Flames] originally appeared in 1968 and 1969 in the legendary French cartoon anthology, PILOTE.In the previous adventure, ""Les Mauvais Reves,"" Valérian, space-time agent for 28th-century Earth, rescued the spunky redhead Laureline from the mad scientist Xiombul. Now Valérian must pursue Xiombul to Earth circa 1986, a dark age about which little is known. Laureline follows to help Valérian and save Mr. Schroeder, future inventor of time travel, who Xiombul has kidnapped.Mézières artwork is still in its earliest stages and figures, especially, are rather crude. However there are clear signs of a grand breadth of the imagination both in the artwork and in the story, an early effort by famed French comix scripter Pierre Christin."
4,"Great Headband, Could Use Some Stretch","****This headband is soft and perfectly adjustable to any head size. Its only flaw is that it has absolutely no stretch at all, which tends to make it slip if you have straight hair, as I do. Still, it's a great headband, and good for keeping my hair off my face when applying creams and lotions. However, I would wear it a lot more if it didn't slip around so much when I was active, because of the absence of stretchiness. If you have curly hair, it would work wonderfully.Despite its flaws, I still recommend it with the above reservations---it's a good headband!****"
3,terry headband,"ordered and received it quickly. works great, but would be better if the terry had a bit of a stretch weaved in."
5,Delicious and pretty,These are made of quality chocolate and are delicious. Underneath the foil is a piece of chocolate in the shape of a flower. Bought them for my daughter for Easter and they were nice because I could give her one piece at a time instead of handing her a giant chocolate bunny to ruin her teeth on. She was also delighted by the packaging and flower foil covers.
3,CRISTOBAL PERFUME,I LOVE THE FRAGRANT BUT COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW TINY IT WAS.I KNOW IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PRODUCT BUT IT'S LIKE A SAMPLE SIZE
3,Sloppy.,"This book is a hodge-podge. Very difficult reading. You can do better. Based on a talk in London, it comes out in print as wet spit. Let me help you. I have always tried to help you but you wouldn't let me. Buy ""How to Practice"" by His Holiness. And""The Compassionate Life"" by His Holiness. Also, ""Introduction toBuddhism"" by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. All of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's books are incredibly contstucted. They are like a clearriver of fresh mountain water. Forget the NKT controversy aboutDorje Shugden. I investigated it thoroughly. It all startedfrom a book called ""The Yellow Book"" published in 1975. That'sall I will tell you. This book is a wash-out. ""How to Practice""and ""The Compassionate Life"" are pure gems. Buy them. Buy Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's books. And above all, get a life! Thank you."
5,Gotta Have it in My Life!,"I can honestly say that no matter what I'm going through, there is a song on Tonya Baker's cd that addresses it, good or bad. Her voice is none like no other. A ""true"" worshiper indeed! This is the real deal. Buy the cd, you won't be disappointed!P. BrownDayton, OH"
1,Clap your hands and stomp your feet .......,......cause Bach has done gone country. Well yeeeehaaaa!!!!! ... What's next? How about Mozart on harmonica. Telemann on jews harp and wash board. Let the baroque barnyard dance begin. Weeeeehooooo!!!!!!
4,Interesting read.,Not over bearing but an excellent insight on the choice to marry for love and not skin color. I would recommended to anyone!
3,Light Skin Biracials Face Hatred,"Just Don't Marry One is also about transracial adoptions and biracials. This book claims the lighter the skin color the higher the price of female slaves. That's false skilled female slaves were worth the most. What wasn't mentioned in the book is reverse colorism (hatred of light skin biracials/blacks). I'm a light skin black and I had lived in Philadelphia (ninth-poorest U.S.city,black majority)for many years. There's a lot of reverse colorism in Philly. In Philly many dark skin black young adults don't date light skin biracials/blacks. Sometimes brown skin blacks date them. I have lived in cities that weren't like this. There are few light skin biracial/black and dark skin black young adult couples in Philly."
2,Not what it is touted to be,"This book is not so much about interracial relationships as Christian prejudices, doctrine and rhetoric. Not interesting to non-Christians. Also, the topic of interracial marriage is only a ""charged"" issue if you are in fact from a prejudiced background, religion, culture, or area (and not everyone is)."
1,Needs a different title,The title of this book is very offensive. It implies that you are marrying a thing rather than a person. The title alone makes you think that the author(s) are racist. Not a wise choice
3,Maybe Overrated,This wax doesn't seem to work as good as expected for me. I was hoping it would restore some old pieces of furntire better than it did plus it's sort of hard to apply evenly without a lot of elbow greese to get the streaks out.
1,Use polyurethane,"took a long time to arrive Waxed harwood floors are much more difficult to make look fresh than acrylic or polyurethane floors, in my opinion. ANY water, even damp mop dulls the finish. Only swept or vacuumed leading to a dull, dusty finish within about 1 week. The Briwax company says that the only way to clean is to put more wax on--how convenient (NOT!)."
5,Awesome,"This soundtrack is one of the FEW I have found lately that was not only great, but also hit every song I heard on the movie. No ""inspired by"" tracks. The only problem I had with it is that a couple of the Incubus tracks seem forced into the movie (like in the credits) and don't fit the subject. That doesn't make them any less great to listen to though. Loved it!"
4,Most hated but not least valuable,"So far, we have gone through the equivalent of a variety of conversations you would expect to have with a three-year-old about eating his vegetables.Me: Just try them.Him: I did. I don't like them.Me: Try them again.Him: I hate them.Me: Yes, they will be good for you.Him: I don't like them.Me: Just one more day.Him: No!Me: They are good for you.Him: I don't care.Stay tuned for more poignant moments because these are the days of his life."
1,Disappointed,"As someone who spends a great deal of time on my feet, I have worn custom orthotics for years. Seeing the commercials on TV for the Walkfit, I thought it would be worth the small investment to try them. I couldn't even keep them in my shoes for the recommended hour! Although it provided much-needed arch support, the hard plastic was very uncomfortable. I don't suggest these for anyone who is used to wearing custom orthotics."
3,Heel Pain Relief,"I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis. The WalkFit Orthotic inserts, in the proper size, eliminated the pain associated with the Fasciitis. The price was reasonable enough that I have made multiple purchases. The only negative is the shipping charge is too high."
3,works,I have flat feet and my archs fall from time to time which is very painful. With these that never happens. These are durable and much cheaper then ordoitics
5,"JUST LOVE IT ""NO PAIN ANYMORE""","I WORK STAND UP ALL DAY I WAS THINKING BEFORE I GOT THIS PRODUCD BUT I CAN SAY I LIKE IT ALOT HELP ME I CAN FEEL THAT DIFERENT WHEN I USED AND WHEN I NOT..........REALLLY WORK FOR ME.........TRY IF U FEEL PAIN ,OR TIRED........!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,HORRIBLE,"This is a terrible product and a horrible company. Delivery was very slow and inserts were intolerable. I promptly returned product, but did not receive refund, despite many phone calls. Beware of how much you're paying for nonrefundable shipping and handling if you're ordering directly from WalkFit - $29.85!!"
3,Fast Service,Takes a little time to get used to....After 1 month I can't say I've really noticed any reduction in my back discomfort after an extended walk.
2,Star falls short,"A dingy muddled piece with low brilliance, and a chunky chain. Promised presentation case was not provided as advertised, came in a cheap drawstring bag. But there is no time to return and replace due to counting on item for a birthday present. Marginally acceptable transaction. The only good aspect was on time shipping. Whoopie ! Never again. Jewelry should be bought at a store not sight unseen - expensive lesson."
1,Fishing tip a day calendar,The cover is the only color page of the calendar. The graphics are the same for everyday. this is a very poor imitation of the page-a-day calendar.
2,Do not reccomend,"It simply does not work consistantly. It will just annoy you. The readings; if you get one, will sometimes be 200+. This would mean your heart is going to explode at any second. It will then throw off the averages of you workout and render readings calculated useless.It does work well when resting or lower readings, but that is not why I need it. I tried two and had the same result for both. I still use it, but it just for the basic functions (i.e stopwatch). I contacted Mio (not where I bought it) and got advice from the Tech. that didn't work or apply."
1,Very Poor on performance and service,"The watch is not accurate at all. Most of the time, when using a strap it doubles my heart rate.I called customer service twice and have sent two emails - there is no response.I do not recommend this product or company."
5,Fantastic resource for WW2 buffs,"I am researching for and writing a World War II novel. In collecting materials I had DREAMS about a book like this! When I found it, it was like a book just MADE for what I wanted: a detailed daily account of the war. I have read literally dozens of books about WW2, but I have never found a resource as invaluable as this one. There are stories and information in it that I have never seen anywhere else."
3,Don't judge a book by it's cover!!,"This book really catches your eye with the sexy cover, but it is just a basic no action book. The author just gives a luke warm look into the life of Tina and what could have been a great spicy book. This book was not on a Zane level so don't get it twisted!!"
1,Dissapointed,"First off, I love love love Richard Jeanty! So I was eagerly anticipating this book. BUT I hated it. The main character, aside from a few brief descriptions of her family, just described one sexual encounter after another. Maybe if they were actually framed around a plot, that would be ok. But I felt like I was reading a dissertation on freakin' instead of a novel.But Richard Jeanty is the bomb, I've read his other work, and remain a fan."
1,Ugh! Wish I Could Get a Refund!,"I was actually a little excited about reading this book, based on many of the reviews. However, I must conclude that most readers who rated this highly are either friends/family or their imaginations are 15 times better than the writer's (thus the writer is just a pawn throwing out ideas) or they are IDIOTS. I'm sorry, I just could not focus with all the grammar errors! How can I focus when I'm trying to figure out what the sentence is trying to convey?!?!? And, for the most part, it was like the same scenes recycled with different participants. I really, really tried to be supportive of this writer (for various reasons), but I choose to give advice instead: 1) Proofread, 2) Proofread while reading ALOUD, and 3) Get a higher quality editor. Thanks for the effort. For anyone reading this who have read other books by this writer, does it get any better???"
4,Good Good Good,"This was one of the follow-up books I read after reading another book for beginners. This covers it all, and very well."
3,Learning to play bridge,"The book has all the required information. However,the author's 'cutesy' way of writing may put you off a bit. If you don't like that style then try another book."
3,Bridge for Dummies - not so good,"This book is not bad, but unfortunately is not clear, and not fun to read.It goes in to details too quickly.It appears to be aimed at a person becoming an Intermediate Player"
4,Bridge for Dummies,"Fun ""boobie prize"" for a bridge party. I don't know the quality of the information inside, but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to give this book to a beginner or intermediate player. I personally have not read the book. I bought it more for the ""nature"" of the gift than the written information. The people who received it thought it was a very clever gift."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment,"I've been playing bridge at an intermediate level for many years and was interested in having a general reference as well as expanding my skills at bidding and playing. This book has two major problems for me. First, the point count system used is non-standard -- at least it is different from anything I have encountered before. Only high card points are used -- no distribution points. So point counts for standard bids are correspondingly lower and one has to remember all sorts of special cases to decide what to do.The second problem I have is the way hands are displayed. Hands are illustrated with tiny, badly printed card images, with no colors. So Hearts are hard to distinguish from Spades and Kings look alot like Jacks."
2,Not for beginners,"I don't recommend this book for people who are completely new to bridge, despite the title, which suggested to me that it was appropriate as a beginning book. To give one example -- a new player needs to know how to make an opening bid. This book has a thirty page chapter on the opening bid. Once one has memorized that, then there's another thirty page chapter on responding. It would be a lot more helpful to give a few rules of thumb, then add rules a few at a time as the reader practices. One thing I learned -- don't buy a book as a beginner based upon reviews by experienced players -- they can't remember anymore what it was like to be new at the game! This book may be okay as a reference, but certainly not as a way to get started."
4,Bridge For Dummies,"A well written book, easy to understand and takes you through the principles of Bridge in a logical and thoughtful manner."
5,Best Book,"This is the best book I've found for those of us needing a refresher course in bridge. Much better, for me, than Goren. I would highly recommend this book for beginners."
4,beauty from the woodwork,"this is a fantastic cd, and it really is a shame walker isn't any more well known. when chicago radio station WNIB switched from classical, Walker's peice Lyric was the one that filled in their final classical slot. thus was my introduction to walker so i bought the cd. it's gorgeous and saturated with emtotion, all the works on this cd have huge climaxes and are thick with inner orchestral voices. none of that superficial first violin dominance. Lyric (for strings) is almost Adagio for Strings-esque, in fact when i heard it played on WNIB i almost mistook it for that, but it's a bit less ominous. this comes highly recomended. time to spread the works of walker"
3,Prada Large Nylon Backpack,I have had the bag less than 6 months and already the zipper pull broke on the outside pocket....the most used zipper that I use. I was surprised at the quality of the bag considering it is Prada.
2,"""Hold Me"" Doesn't Thrill Me","I've been interested in finding a recording of a tune I knew from my salad days, ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me."" The recording by Karen Chandler proved adequate, but not quite what I remembered. Before I purchased the Connie Francis disc I had listened to the excerpt on Amazon. Although she sang the song at what seems to be a dirge tempo, I decided to give it a try. Much to my chagrin, Ms. Francis omits the second line of the bridge--to my mind the dramatic high point of the song--and then proceeds to omit most of the last quarter of the piece. I haven't listened to rest of the CD, but if ""Hold Me"" etc. is the piece you want, look elsewhere."
3,Low powered amp,"I bought this amp to power my single 10"" 500w pyle sub. I returned it after learning the RMS power is actually only 35. So, bridged would be a little under 100 watts of continuous power."
5,Crave stands apart from the rest!,"Louise Mosrie's new CD, CRAVE is a monumental execution for a newcomer (though she's no newcomer to her huge following in Tennessee - fans who have been fortunate enough to witness her career's astonishing development first hand!) Resist the temptation to compare Mosrie's sound on this CD to others....her strikingly original songs and heavenly vocals set her apart from the rest and will quickly entice listeners who will be thrilled by their discovery. As a member of the San Francisco media, I have no doubt this CD would stand up to the best that the local music scene has to offer. It's only a matter of time before the Bay Area, and indeed, the rest of the country, will be craving the unique sound on Mosrie's CD, CRAVE."
4,HP Printer Cartridge Combo Pack,Product is what I ordered and came to the house quickly. Good price for the combo pack.
3,Not original HP ink,This is not the original HP ink.. it works though.. the colored runs out very fast.. but I could never tell since I am not the only one who uses our printer .. I still have the black ink.. though it always complain that the black ink already run out.. you just have to ignore it and print again..
3,GOOD2GO!!!,"I am a 1st time buyer and I am satisfied so far. But, I can buy the same product at a local store fOR same price. So, I would save myself some time next time. GOOD SERVICE GOOD PRODUCT FAST SHIP4SURE!!"
5,"Off-brands not as good, stay with HP!","Have tried the off-brand cartridges in my HP printer and noticed that the quality of print was very much worse. Stick to the HP brand name if you need to print decent looking documents! Could not get good quality images with the off-brands, either. The HP cartridges last longer and make better printouts all around."
5,Ink Cartridge,Quality ink cartridges at a very good price.I've never had a bad product from HP. Cartridges last a long time.
4,HP 21/22 Cartridge-Combo pack,"With free shipping, it is worth the price. I bought on-line because I had gift cards. It arrived on time. There are probably other brands that are cheaper that would be suitable for the HP f-4180,but I am not aware of them."
5,HP brand-what do you expect?,I needed ink for my ink-jet printer. Both ran out the same time so a combo pack seemed like a good value. Ordered the OEM HP ink and expected them to be perfect. They were. Item arrived next day which was a surprise. Used free shiping which said it would come in 5-7 days.
3,hp21/22 combo ink,"the cartridges are ok, ink does not last very long. I printed 50 pages, manual duplex, draft mode and I started getting faded color bars.Not the supplers fault, just don't trust reviews, re-manufactured are not as good as orgninal."
4,"Good Ink, Wish it Lasted Longer","In my expieriance, HP makes a very high quality product. These ink cartridges are no exception. The installation of the cartridges is quick and easy taking at most a minute or two. And the ink produces a quality print from the moment the cartridges are installed. I'm a graduate student, so my only real complaint is that the cartridges don't seem to last long enough. That's more a fuction of the crazy printing needs of grad students (which could be 50-100 pages a week.) than a reflection on HP product quality."
1,Not HP,"These are cheap knockoffs, not HP cartridges as stated and shown in the product picture.If you want fake cartridges, there are cheaper ones, or you can refill old ink cartridges yourself. If you want genuine HP cartridges, these are not them."
5,HP 21/22 Ink Cartridges,THE TWIN PACK INK I RECEIVED IS GREAT. THE QUALITY AND SPEEDY SERVICE WAS WONDERFUL. I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THE SAME. THANK YOU!
1,What a waste of money,"The first cartridges sent were defective and would not allow the printer to work. The resends have since run out of ink, and I'm not a heavy user. I wrote to the seller and got no answer, so seller, here's my reply - your business should be out of business the same as my cartridges are out of ink."
4,Genuine Ink,It is hard to find genuine HP inks at a reasonable price. This combo pack is well below what you will typically find in most stores. It arrived factory sealed and installed without a problem. I was so glad to see that it wasn't a refurbished set of inks.
2,ink half full????,"I recieved the product as stated,and on time. BUT the ink just doesn't seem to be as crisp and bright as it should be coming out of a ""new"" sealed package. Not sure what is up with that. I think I will go back to my old supplier."
4,Ok deal I guess,Fast delivery. Product as described.Maybe I got the best price. New HP injet cartridges are close to the same price everywhere.These guys might be the best.
1,Did Not Last,"The color cartridge seems to work fine since I've gotten it (about 2 months ago), however, the black one ran out of ink after printing 15 pages of a word document. Really cheap."
2,Lost in the Mail,I waited 3 weeks for this printer cartridge to come in. It apparently got lost in the mail somewhere in the western part of the country. But Amazon made good and refunded my money promptly when I sent them an e-mail explaining what happened. FYI- Be sure you keep up with any order numbers you get if you order anything from anywhere.
1,Order from HP website,"I ordered this product from the Amazon website instead of directly from HPs website.What I got was a colored cartridge that was damaged and leaking ink.The prints were horrible with all colors running together.You don't know what you are getting until you open and place it in the printer.After that you are stuck with it and can't return it.No tax was included when I ordered here at amazon for this product.(God knows where it came from).In the end,no tax didn!t matter did it."
1,wrong cartridges,I ordered the 21/22 cartridge combination because that's what the web page told me to order. It was wrong. I need HP 60 (CC640W and CC643W).I don't know how to return it and get the right ones. Can someone advise me?
1,Wrong Part Received,Received wrong ink cartridgeHP 21/22 Ink Cartridges Combo-Pack in Retail PackagingI ordered HP21/22 and received HP 60
2,one cartridge had problem,The black cartridge only lasted for 10 copies and the color is still going. I wish that the black would still work.
5,Ink,"Came as shown, same as what you would get at stamples but at a much cheaper cost. Brand new with plastic packaging."
3,Roselyn,"I am not sure how I feel about this product at this point. My computer tells me the black ink cartridge is low on ink when I installed it. The color cartridge is full. At this point, I am going to continue using the cartridge and will see just how much ink is in the black."
4,Easy to order and quick service,Cartridges were exactly the ones I needed. Ordering was easy and cartridges arrived in a timely matter. Very satisfied. Good value.
4,refurbished works fine,"I was not very sure abt the diffrence between the new one and refurbished one, but I have seen alot of videos on youtube to recycle your old inkjet cartridge.So just for experiance I bought the refurbished one which was cheaper then the new one and it works perfectly fine."
5,Excellent Product and Value,"I didn't realize when I bought this it was a remanufactured or clone product. I thought it was a NEW HP product. I've tried this type of product before and NEVER been close to satisfied.I was going to just ship this back, but I decided to give it try 1st and I will admit I was wrong.I can't tell the difference between this ink and higher-priced HP ink.I will continue to but this product as long as it is available and continues to offer a significant saving over true HP ink carts."
4,HP 21/22 Ink Cartridge combo-pack,I purchased this to replace the exact same cartridge brand which is in my printer/scanner/copier. The original ink lasted 11 months with moderate use. It is the same brand as what I've just purchased.I anticipate it to last as long. Colors are crisp.
5,"Great Ink, Fast Shipping, Great Price: A+","Excellent shipping time, price, product. I am definitely going to keep ordering my ink from Go-DPS. A+"
5,Cartridges work great....,and I saved a ton of money buying them here as opposed to in store. Great value!
4,Best Price Out There!,Amazon has the best price out there on these HP ink cartridges. Especially when you combine it with the Prime 2-day shipping. It beats running to the office supply store. I only wish HP would make their printers a bit more efficient on ink comsumption. The printers are great and inexpensive but they use a lot of ink even on draft mode.
4,Just what we expected,"It works fine. Kind of necessary, when one has this printer, to have the correct inkjet cartridge."
2,Overpriced,This product like all ink cartridges is grossly overpriced. I bought a laser print so I can save hundreds of dollars a year on toner.
1,Good for at least five printouts,"All the time you see these ads for reconditioned cartridges for your printer. Well, let me tell you, that is Russian roulette. I've now bought two sets at various times, and neither set worked. The OEM printer maker had sensors that could tell that the integrity of the unit had been compromised by ink refilling. It is outrageous that we, the consumer, have to suffer a closed system compelling us to buy their overpriced refills, but very few can get around it. Our printer costs should be almost zero but instead can be quite high, especially if you don't print that often.As for these cartridges, I do not print that much, so my costs as a function of usage are incredibly high. The cartridges went dry today after only three months of use (i.e. being stalled) and having printed the incredible outlay of five pages...yes, five...The paperless society is starting to sound good now, in light of the above..."
1,Estafa los compre como nuevos y eran usados,Compre los 3 combos y cuando se le acabo la tinta los fui a recargar ya estaba la almohadilla pinchada
4,Good Christian lady,Nice PRICE AND good item. I thank you for the opportunity to tell the truth. GOD Bless you and GOD Bless America!
3,Super short lifespan!,"I have used this exact ink before with no problems, but for some freaky reason, after less than a week of light use, I got messages from my printer saying I was nearly out of tricolor. Either this cartridge is a dud or my printer is malfunctioning. Either way, I am still glad that I ordered new cartridges rather than re-filled ones. If the real stuff is crappy, how great can the refills be?"
3,Missing Lag Screws,"Overall satisfied with the product. However, it was missing the four lag screws it was supposed to come with. Since I didn't open the box until I was ready to hang the swing, it was too late to send it back. Went to Home Depot for the missing parts."
3,also no lag screws....what's up with that?,"Luckily I read another review that stated the lag bolts were not in the box.I was on my way out the door to travel to my daughter house (an hour away) Justto install the swing we bought her for Christmas. I would have been really unhappyto find them missing when we got there. Fortunately, I called and had her open thebox before we left so I was able to stop and purchase some on the way to her house.Why on earth sell something like that without the lag bolts....it does state on thebag that they should have been included. Lookds"
3,The Talented Christian Vander,"For my money, Christian Vander remains one of the truly great musicians of my generation.That said, this CD is difficult to listen to as a whole. It is comprised primarily of Christian Vander's drum solos (his continuing quest for the ""supreme"" solo). Drum solo followed by drum solo followed by drum solo is difficult for my ears and psyche to take no matter how skilled or musical or energetic they are.Vander's talent behind the drums is unsurpassed - I know of no better drummer. This double CD is a fine demonstration of that. Listening to parts of this CD at different times is the only way I am able to satisfyingly digest it."
2,Not pleased; returned for refund,"I was disappointed in the performance of this spotting scope. The eye relief is too short, but my main complaint was that the focus is not maintained when changing the magnification setting. That is, when observing an object after properly focusing the scope, re-focusing is always required when the magnification is changed. The more the change, the more correction is needed. This is something that should not be necessary in a good spotting scope."
4,Not good enough to use with camera,"Don't be mistaken into thinking you can take pictures with this also. I took mine to a workshop for this purpose, only to learn that the power was just under the lower limit for being able to take pictures. Otherwise I'm very happy with it."
5,Cool little scope.,"I wanted a good quality, but inexpensive and lightweight spotting scope and that is exactly what this is. It is quite durable as well. I am using it with a SLIK U8000 tripod and padded case. I have had it about 2 years with no problems. I use it for long range viewing and for watching wildlife. The view is clear and crisp enough for me, but will dim at high power like most zooms. This is not a problem in bright sunlight. The setup is light enough for short distance hiking. My only complaint would be that the zoom lens is not par focal. That is, it needs to be re-focused when you change power setting. That is the trade off on the price, though."
3,"Useable, not great","The Alpen 15-45 x 60 spotting scope was purchased to sit on a tripod in our lakeside family room so that we could look at birds, boats on the lake, etc. The 45 deg eyepiece is useful in this setting. At 15x the spotting scope is OK, but as you increase the power the image becomes darker and harder to use. We'll probably never use the zoom feature because of this, and just treat it as a fixed 15x optic. Knowing this now, I would have purchased some other product with an angled eyepiece, even if it was more expensive."
4,Great Starter Scope,"I'm giving this scope 4 out of 5 stars as compared to other low end scopes. It is not an amazing scope but it is a great value. This scope is nothing compared to a high end German or Nikon scope, but at 1/10th of the price it does the job. At 15-30 x the image is ok. At 45x its not very useful. Most folks will say, ""save up don't buy something until you can spend at least $600."" For me however I will probably never have enough to spend $600 on a scope. So for me, something is better than nothing. Another great thing about this is that it will let you know if you use a scope enough to justify spending big bucks on a scope."
5,great product,"I purchased this spotting scope for my son to use for target shooting in 4H. We havn't had the opertunity to use it for that but we have been using it for watching Deer and other wildlife. It is working great, it may not gather as much light and be as bright as some much more expensive scopes but it is well worth the price paid and should work great for target shooting."
5,spotting scope,I got this for my husband and he loves it. We live in the mountains and he is able to spot animals at a pretty far distance.
3,things are seldom what they seem,"back in the day i owned an import copy of 'all our own work', i loved it. i wanted to enjoy the music again so i bought this issue. what a fiasco. about 4 of the tracks do not have sandy denny. 5 cuts are denny and the strawbs - not even one side of an l.p. 3 titles have overdubbed string sections. all and all a big let down."
3,good for the price but not great,"This is a very good looking shower set at first. My problem is that the tub spout is PLASTIC and stays spotted with water spots. My other big problem is that the descripton did not specify how you turn on the shower. I just assumed there was a diverter near the on/off and temp levers. I had that part installed about chest height so i wouldn't have to bend over to turn on the water (like my old tub facet that was just a few inches above the tub spout) but in order to make the water come out of the shower head for this one, you have to turn on the water, then bend over to the tub spout and pull the end of it down. I would have never bought this had I known that. If you can live with those issues it works fine."
4,Where is this guy from?,"Saw Santo at a Show in Pomona and he rocked the joint! Man, it sure does feel good to know that they is some ORIGINAL talent still rockin' the mic!"
2,Latter-day Godfather wheezes through the holidays,"This music gets an A for effort but a C- for delivery. JB gets high marks for cowriting 10 new songs, but the backing tracks are warmed-over new jack swing and the Hardest Working Man In Show Business is showing his age - to put it kindly. As a big fan, I found the album fascinating (if not enjoyable), but every one else is advised to seek out James' stellar late 60's Christmas recordings. See James Brown's Funky Christmas (B000001EFD) or Christmas Collection: 20th Century Masters (B0000C23DH)."
5,Another fine James Brown christmas effort.,"JB's fourth Christmas album, and first in almost 30 years, continues the remarkable trend: some of his best music was made for the season, and here is the '99 entry - a decidedly ""economical""-sounding electronic approach nonetheless yields a consistently warm and engaging sound built upon an upfront vocal with little or no echo with a strongly insistent chorus. ""Christmas Is For Everyone"" is excellent in this approach, as is ""Not Just Another Holiday"", and the album opener, ""Sleigh Ride"", a very entertaining laid-back cut. ""Clean For Christmas"" and ""Reindeer On The Rooftop"" are happy sounds, the latter more extemporaneous. The best song, a definite James Brown *Classic*, is the thoughtful slow-tempo ""Mom & Dad"", something to be played over and over again at home - and on-the-air! Radio Station programmers listen up!!!"
4,"Conventional style, but interesting plot","Sawyer managed to write a very traditional crime story in a cyberspace setting. The plot has some interesting twists and kept me occupied for quite a while. The author suceeded in not making a certain philosophy of life appear superior to others, even though the most pervasive topic of the book (the ""soul"" and life after death) could have tempted him to do so."
3,"Good ideas, but poor characterization","There were two main ideas in the book: the philosophical implications of the discovery of a 'soulwave' that exits the body after death and an AI experiment that makes three differing copies of a human's brain to determine what makes up a soul. The author should have stuck to these concepts.The subplot regarding an affair between the protagonist's wife and a coworker took up far too much of the book. This subplot did feed into the main plot, but the point was belabored. Another subplot involved the investigation, rather simplistic, of the murders of the coworker and the wife's father.The dialog in this novel was very stilted. For example, when they weren't talking about technical concepts, the protagonist and his AI friend interacted like teenagers, complete with obscure Star Trek references. I found the monologs spouted by the AI versions of the protagonist to be the best dialog in the novel."
4,"Good story, not much of a murder mystery","This is a good story about AI, morality and mortality. If that's what you're looking for, you probably won't be disappointed. You will be disappointed, however, if you're expecting an exciting murder mystery with lots of plot twists and a surprise ending. It's obvious from the outset who ""dunnit"". Still, it's an enjoyable read with some good bits about chimpanzees"
3,"Interesting read, thought provoking....","I am usually not a sci-fi reader, but picked this up at the library. I have heard a little about AI but dont understand it very well. I found this book to have an interesting story about what could happen with AI. It definatley held my interest. Coming from a biblical background, the life/death issues went way south of what I believe. I gave it 3stars because even if you dont like sci-fi its worth reading. The story was good, the characters were good, and the idea plausible."
2,Good premise that had nothing to do with the plot.,"I still don't understand why nearly half the book is dedicated to a completely different premise (that one can definitively detect the soul)? A hundred pages of setup for the ""Gee, this makes me want to simulate myself"" plot? I would have been much happier if the soul-thing had been the entire story.And does there HAVE to be a killer on the loose in every sci-fi book I read these days? Oh, for the days of Asimov and Heinlein."
1,This is science fiction????,"The author apparently has written mostly mysteries prior tothis novel,and IMHO hasn't a clue what science fiction is about. I didn't finish the book- perhaps it got more interesting later? It also might be enjoyable for those who aren't looking for hard sci-fi."
2,Random Walk,"What a let-down. After reading Flashforward (also by Sawyer) and enjoying it sufficiently to look for more by the author, I happened upon Terminal Experiment. I have now had my fill of Sawyer for the forseeable future. Sawyer can't seem to decide what this book is about: mushy theistic philosopy, an affair between the protagonist's wife and her co-worker, a murder mystery, or an AI experiment (of the possibilities, the last at least had potential for an interesting plot). Unfortunately, Sawyer meanders aimlessly through all of the above story lines without addressing any one of them in an interesting way. Combine this with stilted plot, a whiny protagonist, and an uninteresting supporting cast, and you don't have much. Hard to believe this won a Nebula. It might be worth reading if you find it in the pocket of the seat in front of you on the airplane, but this book is certainly not worth buying."
5,Do souls exist? Find out...,"I could not set this book down; I read it in one long, hot afternoon last week. And I will simply say the last few pages made me sigh with fulfillment and relief that the author could actually come up with a way to complete this fascinating story.I have read reviews of Robert J. Sawyer's books criticizing his ""Star Trek"" and other pop-culture references, and to that I suggest these critics note the references to Shakespeare, Greek mythology, not to mention untranslated Latin quotations routinely found in earlier popular authors; Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey novels for instance; and realize that all authors cite what are familiar and normal parts of their world."
5,Great story,"This was the first sf story that got me. The main plot device worked very well. I first read this as a serial in Analog, and I look foward to rereading it in softcover form."
2,Avoid it like the plague!,"Boringly mundane, with completely bland uninspiring characters, an unexciting plot, and feeble attempts at provoking discussion on Big Themes.How did it EVER win an award? The shameless plug by Sawyer himself in this review page merely adds insult to injury for all SF fans.Flush this book down the toilet. Now"
1,Must book for Forrest Gump,"Simple answers for almost all the great questions of mankind: meaning of life, existence of God, life after death. Plus mediocre prose. An ideal book for Forrest Gump! Recommended."
1,Dreadful pot-boiler,"Poor characterization, weak plotting, wooden writing, bad SF: a dreadful book. ""Move over John Grisham, your pot has boiled, clear the stove."""
1,"Wimpy, laughably PC characters mar this sf soap opera.","Sensitive scientist discovers the soul while also learning that his wife cheats on him. He moops and cries a lot while his wife bites her lip in silent guilt. If you love Alan Alda, you'll love Sawyer's irritating, patronizing ""hero,"" otherwise you'll wonder why the wife didn't cheat sooner.Sawyer's use of AI ignores issues better handled in Greg Egan's PERMUTATION CITY. Sawyer's computer replicas of the scientist ""wake up"" in the computer, blind and bodiless, yet take it all in stride.Sawyer got an Ontario Arts grant for this book and it shows. It's full of pointless Canada references (was there a quota to qualify for the grant?) A turgid non-thriller."
3,Not hardcore science fiction,"Surprisingly, this book concentrates more on the emotional and philosophical conflicts of the characters. The ""sci-fi"" part of it is merely background, with some of the technology very possible in the near future. The first part of the book tells of super-engineer Peter G. Hobson (you never find out what the G stands for) and how he deals with a personal crisis. He's not trying to save the world from aliens or technology run rampant. He's merely induring what many people also have to deal with today and in years past. The second half of the book then turns into a murder mystery. The ending was rather anti-climatic and too clean cut, but the story was well paced and kept me occupied, although I have to agree with another review saying the characters were a tad wooden."
1,"lame, amateurish, sloppy.","Not well written. Amateurish. Characters one dimensional and clearly severed from the author's own personality. A scientist perhaps, but no philosopher, and no observer of human nature. Big question, how did this sloppy effort win such a prize? Was the competition so lame that year"
3,Does this kind of thing really happen -- in CANADA?,"Parochial feel. Takes place placidly in large Canadian city. World-shaking events, etc. United States just some country to the South, Europe to the East, Japan -- where's that? A minor contribution to the AI sci-fi literature. Instad of this, read THE TURING OPTION, by Marvin Minsky and Harry Harrison"
