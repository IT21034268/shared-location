1,SIMPLY AWFUL,"In no way, shape, or form, is this a professional video production. This is a video travelogue produced by a well-meaning, but unskilled, individual on a group travel trip. It was shot with a single, handheld (non-HD) camera, almost all from a standing position, with the typical zoom-in, zoom-out highjinks. There is nothing artistic about the direction; it's a homevideo through and through. None but the most curious and tolerant viewers would find it to be of value."
5,"Great Card, Simple Installation","This is a high-performance networking card that is extremely easy to install. Bear in mind that Windows does not have the driver needed to use the card already, so you have to insert the CD that comes with it. That's as difficult as it is, so long as you don't mind cracking open your case to install it in an empty PCI slot.*** Update - I'm up to having five of these guys, and love them. The price is great, the installation is a breeze, and they have worked flawlessly for me. Every computer in my house has one in it now."
2,Cards began to fail after a few months and limited use,"I bought two of these cards for my Windows XP boxes when I upgraded my home network to gigabit ethernet. Both cards have begun to experience problems. Basically they drop the network connection periodically. When the cards are disabled and re-enabled, they work fine. I thought I might have a router or DNS problem (usually the issue manifests itself by a failed website call) but I am running with fixed IP addresses and have other computers, both Macs and PCs, running on the same network with no problems. I plan to experiment with drivers but this is a nuisance and I would not buy a Hawking card again."
4,"sympathetic characterizations of the ""upper class""","These are two easy reading books that consist of short episodes in the lives of an ""upper class"" couple in Kansas City in the 1930s and 40s. Each book progresses through their lives, so you see them age and their children grow. The book ""Mrs Bridge"", characterizes her as a true ditz, the kinds who always says meaningless ""right"" things and rich woman preoccupied with shopping. Mr. Bridge is characterized as a remote, clueless kind of guy. The book ends with Mr. Bridge's death and his son sadly recognizing that his dad spent all his life trying to make life better for his family when all his family really wanted was some time with him. Showing the biases of the time of publication, Mr. Bridge becomes much more humane and likeable in the book about him. In ""Mr. Bridge,"" even the annoying Mrs. Bridge is much more likeable. Even though set long ago, there are all sorts of insights that are very human. Everyone can see themselves in this book somewhere."
4,"On the right track, but little detail on dealing with the real world.","Optimal Routing Design is full of good stuff. Full marks for starting the book with the advice ""think about what you would like the network to do"".The book contains a wealth of information on how you should design a network if you were starting from scratch. It assists in clarifying the impact of routing protocol configuration choices.For the operator of an existing network, little information is provided on ""how to get there from here"". Other issues that aren't really addressed are ""Having broken a number of design rules, how far am I from a meltdown?"" and ""What improvement in service/operating costs/convergence would I see if I followed all the rules?""Another area that could have seem more material was how map the desired behaviour of the network (traffic flow wise) into design decisions.Overall a valuable contribution to routing literature. Well done."
1,incohesive with irritating textual errors,"This book is very frustrating and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't already have lots of experience in the field. In fact I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all.The indecisiveness of it leads to regular misdirection. QoS or no QoS? Do this and that or don't? Round in circles.I am quite sure that the author does not have English as a first language, and that the book was never proof read. There are misspellings, subnets that were clearly copied and pasted but not edited for the new position, author frequently confuses the meaning of intra and internets - CCNA 101. It's awful.We networkers have to be pedantic, otherwise we won't see errors in our code. Reading this book is an engineer's nightmare."
1,plastic golf balls,Problem with misleading costs. Product is $2.70/2.75 and shipping is $9.95. Not clear that shipping was so high in relation to the small item.
3,Grand Dad,"I ordered and paid for a ""dozen"" balls but only received nine (9). Three phone calls and a month later I finally received the three (3) balls missing from the original shipment. I ordered on Amazon because these are for my grandsons who were coming to visit, I will get the other three to them later but we all learned a lesson, next time I will go to a retail store where I can buy cheaper and can get any error corrected on the spot."
2,High shipping charges,"My comments are the same as other customer / reviewer - the item is $2 and shipping is $10. Product is fine, but to have a shipping charge of 5 times the retail cost seems silly."
1,Stay Away,"Stay away from this set. It does NOT support 1080p signal input via HDMI. 1080p is only supported via 1394 fireware or Coax connections. The industry standard is now HDMI for 1080p content delivery.As a 20+ year consumer of Mitsubishi products, I have decided to never buy another Mitsubishi product again. I'd go with Samsung for hardcore HDMI products."
3,They're ok.,"Fairly priced considering that all our local shops only carry fishnet thigh highs. Wife thought they wouldn't last long, I'm starting to think she's right. One has a small run starting on the back of the knee. She's worn this pair only 5 times. Guess it was to be expected."
3,Hot Air Styler,"It doesn't really curl my hair, but then again I'm asian... A positive trait is that my hair doesn't get caught in it, probably because I'm asian. Overall I think this item is okay. It would be cooler if it actually curled my hair more."
1,manufacturing standards have dropped to an alltime low,"cheap piece of plastic that will probably break in 6 months. Disgusting they should charge more than $10 for it. Short barrel, one size, hair gets tangled in it. The one from the same name[ Vidal Sasson] I had until recently lasted for years, had a long barrel, and 2 attachments. Vidal would turn over in his grave to see such a piece of junk!"
5,Easy to Use,Get nice curls. My hair is super fine and this works great. Easy to hold and hair drys nice and shiny.
1,Not good for long thin hair,"I have long thin hair and this does nothing for me. It tangles, takes forever to dry slightly damp hair, and doesn't even really curl the hair. Hair dryer and round brush is MUCH better."
2,Very Disappointed,"This product is not very durable; made from cheap plastic. The ""hot air"" barely blows; it would never get my hair dry! It's gotta go back!"
2,Inadequate power,"Does not generate enough heat to dry and style damp hair. Compared to Revlon Ionizer which has same purpose, this Sassoon product takes a very long time with the level of heat it generates to actually remove the most minimal moisture. Very disappointing"
1,Dissapointed,Did not seem to be very good quality. Have used a Revo Styler for years but it no longer works. I had hoped this would be a good substitute but this is a totally different product and no comparison.
1,used once,too small for long hair used it once it is under my bathroom sink still in the box will give it away not for my needs
5,Life is Easier,"My new Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Styler makes getting ready so much easier and quicker. I love it. Previously I was using rollers and drying my hair with a hand dryer - getting ready took 3 hrs. with setting, drying and styling. I've knocked at least an hour off that time with the Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Styler. Now drying and styling happen all in one step - terrific! My husband is happy too as he doesn't have to see me in rollers."
4,Vidal Sasson VS432 Hair Dryer/Styler,The Vidal Sasson VS432 is the perfect product to under-curl my straight shoulder-length hair after I have let it air-dry.
2,Started Overheating within a month,"I had a Vidal Sassoon hot air styler like this for about 15 years, didn't use it every day but really liked it. It started overheating, it would just shut off when half my hair was done. So I found this replacement, looks very similar. IT started overheating after only a month of use. I LOVE how this product works and would have gladly paid double for one that kept working longer. I find if I use the full setting it overheats within a minute. If I put it on low, it usually lasts through the entire styling, but since it's only on half power it takes me a lot longer. I WILL NOT buy another Vidal Sasson. I'll see what other brands are available, even if they cost more."
2,Not for my hair...,"First of all, tangle free is a broad statement from this product. I have long, thick, curly but not ethnic hair. It borders on frizzy at times if I don't control it (think Gilda Radner) for those 40ish people. I do not like this brush at all. It does tangle, badly in my hair and it seems to be over-heating even after only 5 minutes. When I turn it off for a few seconds (to untangle my hair) it won't turn back on for at least 5 minutes. Needless to say, it makes for an irritating, extended experience. I purchased a Conair previously that I loved for my hair type but it broke after only 3 months which is why I bought this. Well, I am considering trying another Conair because at least I loved how it made my hair look. I guess $15.00-$20.00 every 3 months isn't too bad to spend but what a waste!"
2,worked fine for a while,"My beautician gave this to me, (she's a friend of mine) and it worked great for a long time, like a year or more. Then all of a sudden it would quit in the middle of a session of hair doing. It was very frustrating to be straigthening my hair and all of a sudden it would quit, leaving me with half undone hair. So I put it in the drawer and started using my Helen of Troy air brush.I think it thought it was overheating. Then I would go back to it and 30 minutes later, if I chose to use it again, it would work for a few minutes again til it apparently was overheating again. I have plenty of other frustration in my life, I surely don't need a defective hair appliance. At least I didn't purchase it."
4,Nice styler.,"I researched a lot, deciding between big roller, or one of these. My hair is shoulder length and I've been trying to grow it out, but it's so boring- so I wanted to try to curl it or get some volume.I partially blow dry my hair (all the underneath) because its VERY thick. I used this item on the top layer of the hair. I'll admit, this item takes some skin. It is very good and making the hair smooth and shiny- that's for sure!! It is definitely tangle free and a smoother! I struggled with it making half waves with my hair though, mostly because of the length- it isn't short enough to get a good smooth volume lift (it was long enough that it wanted to start to twist into a curl), but it wasn't long enough to actually make into a curl.I blame my hair length. But, I really like it so it will definitely be brought out when I get a tad more length. I was impressed with how smooth it made my hair- it looked nice anyway."
1,"No, no, no!","And I mean no! Do not buy this thing, please do not waste your money. I tossed this very thing into the trash today (I checked the model number to be sure that it was the same one!). I wasn't intending to write up a review of it, but I was searching for a new dryer and came across this product, and then I got mad all over again!It shuts off all the time. You don't even finish drying one small strip of damp hair before bam! it's off. I thought it was overheating, but so quickly? No, it's just a junky product, because this ""overheating"" bit starts almost right away. I was vigiliant that the brush stayed clean. It's easy to remove the barrel for maintenance.I bought mine at Walmart (or Target, can't remember which), and went through two of them before I finally got it through my thick-head that it doesn't work. I love this type of product, but I am now on Amazon looking for a different brand and hoping for something that will last longer than this junk did."
1,"Try another product, this does not curl effectively","I've used several hot air curling brushes over the years. They discontinued the trusty Conair I used to have and I tried this model, which appeared similar. Not only was the barrel itself much shorter, but my fine-textured rather straight hair that usually curls quite easily did not curl at all when I used this. Didn't do much more than a barely conceivable bend. I rarely write reviews, but hope that others don't waste their money on this product."
2,"Works well, but doesn't last very long","My wife has been using this product forever and really loves it but she goes through about 1 a year, she uses everyday. So I don't consider them very durable and I've watched her use them, she is not abusive they just burn out and stop working. I wrote the company, they pretty much said its they only version they sell and they don't have a heavy duty version of the product thats meant to last."
1,Smelly,"For years I have used the 1 inch barrell and loved it. I ordered the 1-1/2 barrell recently. From the moment I used it there was a strong chemical smell. I thought that the more I used it, the smell would dissipate, but this did not happen. I am going to throw it away. I wished I could have returned it, but waited too long to do so. I certainly would be willing to try another one if I could just have exchanged it."
1,poor performance,This item broke after 4 days of use. Its performance was poor even before it broke as it did not curl my hair nearly as efficiently as my European styler.
5,It works great!,This product is great. I had one of these for years and when it started to have a crackle sound I felt it was time to retire it. I have to confess that when I went to Target to find another one they didn't have any of the Vidal Sasson in stock so I tried another brand. This other brand of Hot Air Styler couldn't even hold onto my hair to dry it. I knew what I had to do. I immediately tossed the other hot air styler away and went online to find the same exact one I had before. Low and behold I found one that was just like my other one. I don't know what I'm going to do if this product is ever discontinued.
3,Best I can find,"I've been buying this ""air brush"" for more than 10 years and keep hoping to find one that I won't have to replace every couple/few years. I tired a Revlon version, but the bristles hurt my scalp and the roller burned my ears. I looked at the Revo Brush someone mentioned, but it's got bristles. I looked at the Conair Infiniti Pro that someone recommended, but it's got bristles, too. The Vidal Sassoon is the only one with large plastic bristles/combs and plastic barrel that doesn't hurt my scalp or burn me. I did notice that the Vdal Sassoon turns itself off at my home in Taos, NM but not at my friend's home in Sarasota, FL. Maybe the source of electricity makes a difference. This is the best I can find, so I'm buying another. I wish all of you reviewers the best and thank you for your helpful reviews."
3,Xbox 360 Quick Game Review: Blacksite Area 51,"Don't worry, this wont take much time ;)So I got this game pretty much because there was nothing else I wanted to play and it seemed kinda cool. Well as a whole, the game was just ok. It gave some enjoyment of running around and killing, but it was very limited in the variation of weapons and enemies. It seems like they just recycled the same enemies throughout different environments. And as for the guns, I think I used the same gun the whole way through unless the game specified I must use something else. The graphics on this game were quite poor for Xbox 360. There were times when you would see your comrades feet being about a foot below the ground as they walked around. This game is by no means groundbreaking, but if you haven't turned on your 360 in a while, pick it up to at least kill some time while you wait for other games. Because of the lack of originality and the poor graphics."
3,"Okay, but nothing new","I was distraught after playing this game for a few hours. The game is dreadfully generic. This game is one of the more generic and ho-hum first person shooters ive played in a while. Its short and not very interesting. The game is not very fun and I just didnt get drawn into the story. Your a marine who is up against it all, havent heard that one in a few weeks. Overall if you find this game for 20 dollars I would buy it, but I payed 30 and I was dissapointed. The gunplay isnt bad if your new to the series but, after playing halo3, cod4, gears, graw1and2, this is just poor compared to them.Overall 6.0-6.5"
2,This Game Sucks!,Nothing innovative. Horrible frame rate issues. Crappy ending. Average next-gen graphics. Scant amount of weapons. Too few types of aliens. The developers should have looked to Insomniac for some inspiration. Those guys made a vastly superior alien game in Resistance: Fall of Man. Blacksite is not worth $60. I even purchased the strategy guide because I was so jazzed about this title. Didn't need it as there is very little in the way of strategy. Very disappointed. Going to sell it.
4,BlackSite Xbox360,"Its a pretty fun 1st person shooter with a good adventure feel to it. The game does have some minor programing glitches every now and then, such as an occasional drag during heavy combat and the controls are not as accurate as Call of Duty modern warfare, but for under $20 bucks the game is worth it. The seller sent the game to me relatively quick and it was in the same condition as advertised."
2,Do not pay full retail for this title.,"The graphics are sub par, and no far beyond what you might see on the original XBOX. The game is very, very short. It's unpolished and buggy.I did play online one match and that was a little better. But this pales in comparison compared to some of the better shooters like Gears, Halo 3, and Bioshock. I picked this and Timeshift up at the same time, and Timeshift is a much better game.It's probably worth a rental but not much more."
2,I expected more!,"This game realy let me down! I played the demo on X-Box and it seems prety good. However, when I got to play the whole thing I believe the creators could have done a better job on the graphics. The movement is not as life like as the most recent games out like Call of Duty 4 or Helo 3. The operation of the vehicle in the game is mechanical. I would recommend you rent it first."
3,"Rental, that's sums it up","Take one part ""Rainbow Six: Las Vegas"" and one part ""Resistance: Fall of Man"" and you've got yourself a compressed game that is called ""Blacksite: Area 51"". This was definately a very short game, but pretty fun while it lasted. Not a bad story as well, but we've all been there, seen it, and played it.The sniper feature is a little hectic at start with very slow movement and having to time the breathing patern, but that's real life for you. Also, the turret gun goes crazy once you get behind it and it doesn't just stay still, it moves around which gives you a more realistic feel. I didn't like the sound in this game. The weapons sounded more like people smashing pots and pans together instead of sound capturing real rounds or using studio samples.I haven't tried this online yet, so maybe I'll give that a whirl tonight, but believe you me when I and any other person who says not to purchase and just rent: believe it baby"
2,Area 51,Son says it wasn't as much fun as he thought it would be when he played it. Has a lot of XBOX 360 games so he seems to be an expert..
5,Blacksite: Area 51 for Xbox 360,"We bought this game for our daughter for christmas, and she just loves it! The graphics are excellent! And the game is exciting to play as well as to watch. Another great product for Xbox 360."
5,Great Make-Up/Meet-Up Music,"I first bought this disk for Track 4, simply because I love Sting's rendition of this Gerschwin classic. However, the other tracks quickly grew on me as I listened to them: Rankin' Roger adds a great deal to an already impressive mix on Track 1, the sentiment on Track 2 is a very interesting way to mourn a lost love, and Track 3 has simply been a personal favorite for a long time."
3,Wow!,"At first I was afraid to go out to bars and clubs, but my friends bought this book for me. Now we go to clubs all the time, and boy do we get the babes! ""I put the GRR in swinger, baby!"""
5,"Suggestions, observations, and reminders to live happily","this is a great book, including suggestions like: * compliment three people every day *sing in the shower * plant flowers in spring *return all things you borrow with a total of 511 suggestions for us to be better people, and live happily. this book is full of good suggestions."
3,not all that,It wasn't all that....some of the instructions were not realistic.....there is little humor to the book and is a bit too conservative for my taste.
5,Great pick me up for a blue day!,"This book is just wonderful for making you feel warm and fuzzy all over about how simple life could be if only you simplified and got back to the basics. The instructions are useful and will make you a better person. This is better then 99% of the motivational and self-help books out there. Life a simple and honorable life, and this book will help."
5,Life's Little Instruction Book,"I had previously purchased this book several years ago. As a former high school teacher I shared the ""One"" line notes with my students. This sharing became a routine my students looked forward to see when I posted them. With that in mind, I purchased a copy for my granddaughter for a graduation present.After this purchase, Amazon informed me of the book that contained the first three editions of Life's Little Instructions. I slso bought tha edition."
4,A mixture of common sense and triviality,"This advice book is not among the best I have seen. It does have valuable suggestions but it seems to me that it has more which are trite and even irrelevant. ""Sing in a choir"" ""Take an overnight train trip and sleep in a Pullman"" "" Put a lot of little marshmallows in your hot chocolate"" ""Resist the temptation to buy a boat"" ""Eat prunes"" ""Whistle""This is not the wisdom of the ages.On the other hand there is sound if not terribly original advice in this book. ""Don't take good health for granted"" ""Commit yourself to constant self- improvement"" "" Don't waste time grieving over past mistakes. Learn from them and move on."" "" Leave everything a little better than you find it.""I enjoy such books and enjoyed this one. It is not the greatest except perhaps in one sense. It is extremely short and easy to read."
4,A lovely book but an odd hybrid,"I love this book--the presentation is classy with the slipjacket, the size and paper choice are perfect, and just when I thought I had seen every photograph of Nicholas II's family along comes the Jewel Album! However, that's where the hybrid part comes in--watercolors of men's jewelry is bookended by lovely, mostly unseen photos of Nicholas' family. I would rather have had one book on the jewelry of the whole Imperial family and another separate book on Princess Irene's extrodinary photos. Still, I enjoy this book very much--it's nice to still be able to find new information on Nicholas and Alexandra even in the 21st century."
4,This book is right for the defined audience,"Rick Dobson says his book is for Access developers who want to learn about the ""advances introduced in Access 2000"", developers using other databases who want to learn ""how to implement the concepts within Access"", and for Access power users who want to graduate to developing solutions for others. The book serves the needs of those defined audiences very well (but it isn't supposed to be, and isn't, for the novice user nor is it an introduction to Access).Dr. Dobson has a flair for writing simple, understandable explanations of subjects that are anything but simple. He's done a fine job on this book and I recommend it highly."
3,Provides a basic scope of the features of Access 2000,"This books does a great job of describing the basic attributes and functions of Access 2000, I was expecting more code examples and techniques based on the Programming term used in the title."
5,Very Good And Outstanding one,I really like the book and I'm yet to recommend it to all other friends of my.
4,An Excellent Introduction,"I am an intermediate scientific programmer with no database experience and needed to use Access programmatically. I tried other books but settled on this one when I actually started coding. I needed a broad scope like Dobson's; he includes topics other introductions omit - such as connecting to Excel spreadsheets. I also wanted ADO instructions. I find Dobson's clear, succint style appealing; his examples fit the writing and can be adapted to one's own needs. I bought two."
2,Save your money,"There may be some good Access/VBA books out there. This is notone of them. The section on Office integration is almostworthless. This is not for the beginner and experienced developerswill get little from it. To be fair, there are a few cute techniquesyou can pick up from this book, and it might be worth having around ifyou could pick it up off a bargain table for less than ...."
5,All You need to know About Smokey Robinson the Legend,From page 1 until the end of this book my eyes kept reading and reading and thanking God that this man is still alive today to give us his talent and energy and love. Smokey has come a long way from the 1st page of his biography. This is one you cannot put down. Believe ME.
5,BEAUTIFUL GUITAR!!,"first off, this guitar has really good qualities. When i received this guitar, it was in perfect condition. I really like the head and the neck. I mean everything on this guitar is just amazing. This guitar has a long neck so you can reach pretty high but the fret marks are marked up to 15th fret. So you have to get used to it. Also the guitar is a bit heavier than Epiphone Casino but i don't really care. Since it's a gold hardware, you should polish it after playing. Also the guitar is more yellowish than the pic shown here. Maybe it's just me. Overall, this guitar is beautifully made and i highly recommend it."
3,I liked it,First book in this trilogy the story line is very good. The next two books in this trilogy are also very good
3,Ok,"Item shows a little wear, some browning around the book showing its age. But am overall happy with the product"
1,Not the charger I needed,I to typed in charger for this dinosaur and this is was popped up and i ordered it and it come in today and to my surprise it wasn't the charger for this dinosaur. Uggg I'm so mad.
1,take this down plz,"The toy is great, I was looking for a charger for it. This pops up along with spike the ultra dino - it is the wrong charger. I feel I have been mislead by the seller."
1,Wrong charger period,This does not work with Ultra dinosuar and Fisher price is the only place that has the right battery charger. This charger is I tohught came with something to make it work but it does not. It is advertised wrong
1,not correct,got this to charge my kids toy. they said it was the correct charge but is the wrong item. trully disappointed
1,Had to Return,"I purchased this charger,for Spike the Ultra Dinasour, because the description of this product said it was what I needed. It was not, and I had to return it, the ends where it plugs into the battery pack were incorrect, way to small. Had to pay return shipping because of a wrong description."
2,You get what you pay for...,"No issue with the seller; item was exactly as described and shipped promptly--excellent experience on that front.While my product is not defective, it's not the greatest. The headphones are barely adequate for sound and volume, and the microphone sound quality is bad on speech. The end product sounds closer to an old AM radio than what is considered acceptable nowadays. It works with Skype, and with audacity, but the quality is poor."
3,misrepresent,"I was disappoointed that the video was only lesbian fantasy, thetitle would suggest otherwise"
2,Fiskars knife sharpener,It didn't work well at all. I tried several different types of scissors with little to no improvement on the blades. For paying only a few bucks I shouldn't have expected much.
1,SewSharp Sharpener,Do not waste your money on this small item. The larger Fiskar Sharpener is a better purchase for the money.
4,Does a pretty good job with most scissors,"I've had this sharpener for years now, mostly to sharpen my sewing shears, but I have used them for regular paper-cutting, kitchen and nail scissors and they do a great job. It can be a little hard to get the scissors lined up right, but that might just be me."
4,They work!,"These suprised me, they actually work. The sharpness doesn't last long but these are good in a pinch. A handy, convenient, cheap gadget to keep in the junk drawer!"
3,Not for medium to big scissors,"These sharpeners are good for your small scissors. For regular scissors that are not too thick, I sharpen the blades sequentially using the upper split side opening. They work. These are good to begin with. I'll look for something for my bigger scissors. Good to give others to introduce them to scissors sharpening."
4,Great for a quick refreshing of your scissors,"If you need ultra-sharp scissors, this little gadget is for you. It will return the edge to near new condition with only a few strokes. It is very small and very easy to fit into any kind of sewing or took kit. We have given many away as gifts after using one ourselves. I am not sure how long it will last (as in month or years, not day or weeks) but it does seem reasonably durable."
5,It works,I tried this sharpener on an old pair of cheap scissors that I was going to throw away because they wouldn't cut through anything and now they work again! I've also used it on my good sewing scissors to keep them razor sharp. It definitely works and for the price you can't beat it.
3,a disappointment ..,"Expected better from Fiskars .. difficult to use but will sharpen with patience. For the price ... well, I suppose."
1,Don't waste your money!,Even though this is cheap enough don't be fooled into thinking that it actually works. It does absolutely nothing to sharpen scissors!
1,Cheap plastic toy.,"It's a piece of junk. Doesn't work properly by following the instruction. If you want to buy a real scissors sharpener, go to Walmart or BedBath&Beyond."
2,I'm not sure if this is doing any good or not,"I added this product to avoid paying shipping charges. I used it when I first got it--I do think it helped a bit, but if you are only buying one, get Fiskars 98617397."
1,Don't be duped!,"I don't know if the other reviewers for this product got a different box from me or work for the company in marketing, but I returned another foot spa and purchased this item based on their advice -- and it is awful! Contrary to their glowing reviews, the nibs on the bottom are uncomfortable, the rollers are painfully oversized, the vibration minimal, the splashing substantial, and the heat no better than any other model. The worst of all worlds, and now I'm stuck with it... Buyer beware!"
3,It's OK,"I used it once, and is not really satisfied with it. The interchangable base plate with rollers are located at the heals and the middle. If you have regular size feet and want your toes massage also, it can't do the job.The water temperature is nice. The jet is strong, and I also found a puddle on the floor afterwards. Too much hassle to clean up when you are all tired."
1,"horrible, absolutely horrible, Dr. Scholl should be ashamed",You don't find out that it doesn't actually heat the water until after it's out of the box and you find the teeny sticker inside the thing that tells you that it merely keeps warm water warm (it doesn't even do that). It bubbles onto the floor even at or below the suggested water line. Bubbles and vibration negligible. Noise is ridiculous. Until I'm ready to buy another foot spa contraption I'm not even plugging in thing. I'm just pouring hot water in it and using it as a $20 foot soak bucket. I feel bad for the people who paid more. I'm convinced the positive reviews are coming from people at Dr. Scholls. One would have to have a lobotomy to not be intensely annoyed with this product.
5,spa like relief,"I got this for my husband and used it myself after 5 miles of walking created a blister on my toe. I added mineral salts and thought I was at the spa. The unit heated the water quickly and kept it at a comfortable temperature. There was some splashing, but the towel I placed under the unit, caught the errant water and served to dry my feet. I just wish the storage compartment would hold all the extra attachments."
1,You get what you pay for,"What a bad product... The toner stains the back of each page, definition is bad, consistency of its density is bad... NOT recommendable; I'm sorry I spent the money on this product instead of buying hp original. I wanted to buy an inexpensive toner, but I got a cheap one instead!"
4,Great Trimmer,I love this trimmer in everyway except it has no cover for the blade and I am using it in a Salon and it needs a cover this is the only time I have purchased a trimmer that didn't have a blade cover. I fixed one up myself but this would have been a 5 Star purchase and I would be completely pleased with it.
5,perfect,"I have been using this product more than five years and I am happy that I could buy it again.Battery is long lasting, it is unbelivable, could run more than fifteen minutes.Product have to be regularly maintain.Milisav"
3,Not for face shaving,"I currently use an Andis Outliner II to shave my face, which works very well. I always had a lot of trouble with razors and electric razors irritating my face. The Outliner II doesn't irritate although the shave isn't as close as a blade or electric. However, for traveling I was looking for something smaller and battery powered and chose this one based on reviews.Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well for shaving my face. The best way I can describe it is that it results in a five o'clock shadow to match my Outliner II on the day AFTER I shave with the Outliner II. The Edger II also didn't glide across my face as well as my Outliner II, causing more irritation.The Edger II did trim hair decently well, but since I didn't buy it for that purpose I'm giving it 3 stars."
5,Great Cordless Trimmers!,"This is a my 4th set of cordless trimmers and by far the best. They cut just as sharp as my Andis M3 trimmers once they are adjusted. I''m in the military, always on the go so there serve the purpose. As an Afro-American...these trim with great precision hands down. I also bought the Andis e.Logica Cordless Clipper which produce great results as well. I'm willing to replace my corded Andis for these. Bothe great products for people on the go."
1,Battery Life is terrible,I purchased this product a little over 1 year ago and the battery keeps going dead after each use of about 1 minute. I can't return it now and don't recommend this product to anyone. These products probably sits on a shelf for years before they get sold. Don't buy it!!!
5,Andis does it again,"This litte trimmer is outstanding, small but very powerful, for the close trimming around the ears, and neckline, and keeps beard nice and even."
5,Its exactly what I expected!,I have been been using them professionally for 9 years. one of the safest and best items for kids too. trust me!
3,Not satisfied,I purchased this item about a month ago. I work overseas so I needed something that I can use every two days or so and charge. (due to the high voltage). It came faster than I expected which is good but it lacked the close cutting ability that I needed. It was far from the description and I personally think it costs to much. I've used it a few times since and I just noticed that one of the teeth already broke. I take care of it and charge it every two days but its better for trimming than close cuts. Its an ok item but I would look for something else. I was lucky that I brought my original T-Blades and I then picked up a converter (the higher the better) which makes the them more manageable.
1,Andis Edjer II- very dissapointing,"Save your money. Not a professional in the field. Was looking for sharp clean cuts with this but a best it leaves behind a 5 O'Clock shadow. The blades are as poor as any generic, mass produced blades that are sold for 1/3 the price. Blades cant be adjusted for a sharper cut. Once again, save your cash."
2,Not professional quality,"The blades on the Andis Trimmer are not very sharp, so you do not get a nice, clean trim. I would not recommend this item."
1,"Got It Yesterday, Returned It Today","Other customer reviews indicate that this may be a fine product, but I don't plan to find out. What I wish I'd known is the degree of care the trimmer calls for. To quote the instruction booklet: ""Blades should be oiled before, DURING, and after each use...The clipper/trimmer should be held in a position shown in Diagram A to prevent oil from getting into motor. Place a few drops of Andis Clipper Oil on the front and side of the cutter blades. Wipe excess oil off with a soft dry cloth...To clean the blades we suggest to immerse (sic) the blades only into a shallow pan of Andis Clipper Oil while the clipper is running.""Yikes. Call me a whiner but I don't have time--ok, the patience--for this amount of hand-holding."
3,Short battery life,"I love this trimmer at first. I charged for the first time and clipped my own hair in about 15 minutes. I recharged and clipped my dogs hair and it lost power in one hour. It was fine because one hour is very long for a battery powered clipper. As time went on, whenever i recharge to clip my dogs hair, the battery life became shorter and shorter. Not it can barely last over 30 minutes and its only been about 4 months. After the initial 10 minutes, the sound starts lowering in volume. When i say 30 minutues, I mean its after charging it for over 2 days. This is frustrating the heck out of me as clipping my dogs hair now takes over 2 sessions with charges in between. If i can return this product I definitely would."
3,Mediocre performance compared to sub $20 units,"I have previosuly owned a couple cheap wahl cordless trimmers, for simple trimming of facial hair, and to clean up my neck every so often.The wahls were alright performance wise, but weren't particularly impressive...they did an ok job for shortening, but didn't leave extremely clean lines, especially after a few months of use.So not wanting to have to deal with a corded unit, and hoping that a higher end cordless trimmer would do a better job, I decided that for the money, this trimmer was about what I was looking for.Sadly, the performance gain over the cheaper wahl units is marginal at best, and I'll probably be looking at conceding the point, and just getting a nicer corded model in the future.If you're looking just to do some very minor trimming, this may be for you, and I can say it does seem to have considerably better build quality than the cheaper ones that I have owned."
3,"Good advice, but beware","Loads of wise advice fills this book, but on page eight, I found the definition of the Christian novel I feared: ""a work of fiction that derives from a conservative evangelical perspective."" It is responsible of Stokes to acknowledge this immediately, and she adds that several great otherwise Christian novels of the 20th century would not be included in this definition. This is sad and frightening, but it is the reality. I wonder if Jesus himself could publish his stories within the narrow confines of the Christian publishing perspective."
2,Misguided,"The author states, regarding Christian fiction, ""It is not sermonizing. It is not about saving lost souls ('Rarely,' she says, 'does a religious novel find an audience among the unconverted'). It best not be full of religious jargon or Bible-quoting zealots.""This is shocking, to say the least. Christ commissioned his followers to PREACH to the lost, not to go out and simply entertain ourselves. Now, if we are able to entertain ourselves while leading others into the truth, then so much the better. But the vast majority of Christian fiction on the market is watered down slush that is powerless to change lives, let alone rescue souls from eternal destruction. Fiction is a tremendous venue for speaking the truth to a lost and dying world. What a tragedy it is to waste that venue on our own fantasies and imaginations.Reviewed by ""A Bible-quoting zealot"""
3,"used and marked up, but scientifically correct","I had different expectations, but it is what it is. It is a scientific text book on ice cream production."
5,A Brilliant Book!,"I was enthralled with this book from beginning to end. Chitty painstakingly analyzes every aspect of the Biblical, Old Testament ""God"" and his visits, and tells the true tale of who this visitor really was - and wasn't. I still believe in the Big Guy, but this ain't him, folks. Which makes sense - who would want a God that was as vicious and bloodthirstly and megalomaniacal as the being portrayed in much of the Old Testament? I just wish Chitty would write a sequel!"
5,Pretty good,"I was entertained, which is rather important to me. What I enjoyed the most about this book was how it would look at every single word in the sentence without missing a single one... while at the same time not shoving White LIghter philosphy in your face Good job."
4,A slick professional magazine for advanced photographers,A fairly thin magazine (approx 105 pages per issue) that is packed with information. Too many ads for my taste - but even the ads are informative (so not a complete waste of space). Bi-monthly. Recommended for advances photographers.
1,Schlock,"Awful commie propaganda. Slanderous portraits of Liberals and of the Whites in the civil war. Wafer-thin characters all around, from decadent blood-sucking nobles to gooey warm camaraderie amongst their ""class enemies."" Read Tolstoy instead. Life is too short."
5,Dean - One of a kind,"For any fan of Dean Martin, this Cd is must. Every song brings back to a time when music was great and had meaning."
5,Great CD,This is a must for Dean Martin fans. It has a wonderful selection of his all time greatest hits and will fill your day with music to remember him by.
5,Fabulous!,"As good of music as made anytime, anywhere. Truly essential as the title states. Everyone should hear and enjoy this wonderful artist."
4,Dean was better in the 50's,I am a big Dean Martin fan; but he made better music when he recorded in the Rat Pack days compared to when he was on weekly TV. This was still a great selection of songs anyway.
3,Mixed feelings,"When I saw the cover of this cd advertised I jumped for joy. But then I took a look closer and noticed that 2/3 of the 30 tracks are the SAME Dean Martin songs we are always given. If you're a huge fan, you'll get this for the rare unrecycled tracks that slide through. I certaintly may get this at a later time. But not right now. Cause the last ""definite"" Dean Martin collection I got was 1998's Greatest Hits: King of Cool, which really isn't that far off. The moment I get this one there could be another hits album released. So I don't know. Rating: 4 1/2 on content. 3 on necessity,"
4,Good listen,I enjoy this cd. It has great classic songs that I never hear on the radio anymore. The sound quality is very good.
5,Yep this is Deano!,"Two CD's with 18 recordings of Dean Martin singing on each disc. What more can you ask for? Easy answer. More Dean Martin. If your a fan and have not collected these songs then this is a good collection. The singing and music are clear on both dics. You get a little booklet that is fun to read. Even if you just want background music you cant beat this collection. Worth the price. The CD case is kinda weird in how it opens to get to the second CD disc. It opens from the inside edge, rather than the outside edge."
1,One Bad Song,"There is no song worse to me than ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime"" and that one dud spoiled it for me. I hate that song so much. I would even rather hear construction equipment.The others are decent except this one. That is the one song I never want to hear nor would I ever inflict it on anybody. It's heinous!"
5,Dino: The Essential Dean Martin,"Dean has always been a favorite of mine and my parents. Use to love to watch his TV shows. Great entertainment...what a personality he had, and his voice is so very soothing...Kudos to Dean...I bet he's up there singing for everyone!"
5,They don't make them like Dean anymore,Growing up in an Italian household I heard many of Dean Martin's hits so when I found this CD on Amazon I had to purchase it for my mom. She was surprised and enjoys listening to it.
5,Dino CD,"If you want a CD with popular hits form the Dean this is the one for you. Oh my, so good and so smooth that voice of his. My kids even sing to his songs."
4,Everybody Loves Dean Martin Sometimes,"Dean Martin is the bridge that links Bing Crosby to Elvis Presley. , Dean has one of the sweetest voices ever put down on wax. Too bad Dean did not really make many good records. While Sinatra was the master of the studio Dean would just lay down his vocal and get out to the golf course. That said; Essential Dean does as good job as I've seen in catching the best of Dino.With gems like Houston and Send Me the Pillow it makes you wonder what we might have had if Dean spent more time in the studio. Great Liner notes by Steve Van Zantz testify to Dean's coolness."
1,Longarm: The Bumbling Marshall,"When he is sent to solve a series of holdups of the Santa Fe Railroad,Longarm brings a different personality into play. He can't keep his trip money, charm the wild women, or bluff his way through a problem. Uncle Billy and a witness save his ass. The witness even grows from a jailhouse flunkey to a town marshall after surviving the run of bad luck Longarm's libido and attached parts are having. Mr. Evans go back to Longarm's brighter than he looks personaliry and investigating methods. This dumbass Fad is going to get himself shoot inspite of the length of his tool and dumb luck.."
3,At last (least) it's been rereleased,"If you're new to Robert Wyatt, don't start here. This uneven collection of singles for Rought Trade in the early 1980s has a few gems and a lot of chaff. My favorite, ""At Last I Am Free,"" makes me cry just thinking about it. I have the LP just to play that song. ""Born Again Cretin"" has the trademark Wyatt whimsy and ""Stalin Wasn't Stallin'"" is one of the tastier servings of the old Commie's anachronistic politics. Most of the rest are forgettable. But, like all Wyatt releases, even the less successful numbers have his twinkling sincerity (""Caimanera,"" for example)."
4,I like this book,Much better than this other one i have to read for my college class and gives me more information to go off of... was thinking about selling it but i think ill keep it
2,Disapointing,"My daughter's doctor recommended this book when I asked about discipline of a toddler. I thought it was all pretty ""duh"" information. Then again I am a elementary school teacher so I've had a lot of training in behavior modification. I was disapointed it didn't spend more time discussing time out and discipline techniques."
4,romance that keeps you guessing,"brought this one on vacation for some light reading and couldn't put it down - just had to know what would happen next. mystery, romance, family & betrayal - a great read."
5,Another wonderful book,"As with her other book, the Route 66 Cookbook, Marion Clark has again combined wonderful recipes with interesting facts and history on the ever-fasinating Route 66. I wish I had this book before I took my Route 66 roadtrip. Of course, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys great recipes. But I also recommend it to those who have traveled or long to travel the ""mother road."" It's a great read for all! (I'm eagerly awaiting the release of her next Route 66 Cookbook!)"
4,As advertised,Worked great as advertised. Great for the air powered potato cannon project. 1/4 NPT threads worked good in PVC. Better than the 1/8 NPT size.
2,Perfect size but badly made,I love the the size and every thing seems to fit well enough. Although there were no instruction and nothing to go by. So I had to go on the internet to see what it should look like also one of the suction cups were broken. I mght by another one if it holds up.Update: my original 4 stars is now 2 because it does not hold any fry which it was bought for and the suction cups do not work in the end I had to throw it away.
2,Altogether sucky.,"This guppy breeding net was horrible. It was way to big for my tank, it was a flimsy little piece of junk, and it sucked. It didn't even come with insructions of how to put it together! The frame was flimsy, and broke very easily. The pegs that hold it together were wierd shaped and didn't fit in the holes very well. The actual net was pretty much just a hairnet. The only thing it actually did was keep the bigger fish away from the guppy. I would NOT reccomend this product."
2,Looks decent but quite flimsy,"At first glance, the product looks pretty neat. Some may say that its size is too small, but 10.3 inches is 10.3 inches. So no cribs on that. However, the net is of extremely poor quality and had started ripping off the bottom seams when I received it. In case you want to use this breeder net, I recommend that you glue the bottom seams (with silicon sealant)to the plastic base after you slip the net on. The other problem is with the suction cups. They fit loosely into the slots provided. It is better to apply some silicon glue to the suction cup slots once you have placed the suction cups. So in case you still decide to purchase this product, make sure that you do have some silicon glue on hand."
1,Another once-good knife reduced to garbage,"[EDIT: I had Amazon send a replacement (with low hopes) and it's the same, so the info below isn't just for one defective knife.]I have uploaded a picture to show the difference between a current-production Silver Spur which I purchased this week, and an older Silver Spur II (same knife, slightly larger) from my collection.This knife once had a fine matted finish, giving it a non-shiny but bright gray handle. Now it is just banged around in a gravel pit, and has a chunky beat-up appearance with little pits.The blade also used to align (more or less) with the handle, so the knife had a kind of straight spiky appearance. Now it's just a sloppy mess. The blade looks like it is bent back a little too far, and the lock bar doesn't line up with the handle.The lock release only requires a tiny bump to release the blade.Overall, what once looked like a unique and well-made knife now looks like a total piece of junk."
2,Asks more questions than it answers,"If I had months to study this topical guide would be very helpful. If I am down to the wire to study I actually want to be spoon fed the answers. The whole point was not to get a workbook but rather to get refreshed on what I needed to know. I also bought wordy book by Barrons that was hard to navigate. The only true guide I found was by XAMonline.com. ETS has no vested interest in seeing that we pass because if the test is not passed (by you, not me, hee, hee) who stands to benefit. Do not get me wrong for the price if you have the time it is an extra product that will improve your professionalism. I just wanted something more immediate for my test."
5,Great Product,"This the third Pocketec I have bought. I have been so impressed with the product that I have bought two as gifts for other techies. The design, capacity, durability, and service are all excellent."
2,Three months old and obsolete,"I got this book when it was barely three months on the market.Since WPF (aka avalon) is such a new topic, there are barely any books to teach it. This one is relatively clear and consice. The problem is that the WPF version thay are referring to is obsolete. Many concepts and most examples do not work as is. The whole chapter about Storyboards and animations is completely irrelevant.I believe that a new version is needed, and I am sorry that I bought a three months old book which is obsolete, but I can not blame the author, she did a good job.Regards"
4,One of the Two Greatest Living Sax Players,"The other one is Wayne Shorter.Branford has always been supremely gifted on the sax, but a common gripe that I agreed with was that he didn't seem to have a particularly unique style and tended to be glib, probably because he could play anything. You want Coltrane-like blowing, he can do it; funk, of course, and so on. But he is developing an emotional honesty and seriousness that results in extremely beautiful music. Check out his soprano solo on James Taylor's ""Like Everyone She Knows""(from ""New Moon Shine Album""). When he wants to he can deliver emotionally rather than cerebrally. I heard ""The Ruby and the Pearl"" on the local jazz station and I was floored and surprised that this modest, exquisitely low-key tune was Branford. He just gets better and better."
1,Beware the phony reviews,"Note that the positive reviews for this product were posted on the same day by reviewers who only reviewed other products by the same manufacturer. Clearly they are ""astro-turfing"" -- phony reviews organized by the manufacturer. Any product that requires bogus reviews to encourage sales should be avoided."
1,Garbage,It's as cheap as the money they paid the third world sweat shop to manufacture it. The material is weak and will tear easily and the zipper will come apart. It's also a complete pain in the ass to put on unless you sleep in a crib. PASS!
1,Don't waste your money!,This product is very poor quality. It ripped to shreds the first time I washed it. Don't waste your money!!!
1,Do NOT buy this product,"Unfortunately, after dealing with bed bugs twice in seven months, the very last thing I needed was a piece of crap product that broke the second I unfolded the bed bug allergy protector. I had to improvise and use duct tape to fix this faulty product. Don't waste your $40."
1,destroyed after one washing,"Launder instructions read: machine wash warm, tumble dry low. But, after one washing, the plastic liner totally melted and it's unusable. Works great if you don't care about washing it in the machine -- would have to be hand washed and air dryed."
3,"Good Performance, bad recording","The performance of Laroccha is exceptional, the trills are fantastic and some of the sonatas are almost perfect. The whole compilation sounds very mozartian and may disturb some people that are used into more sweet and passion performances. However the recording of the 2nd and 3rd CD is terrible, it sounds like there is echo in the recording and it becomes very annoying and fuzzy. The key of a good mozart recording is brightness and music purity, which definately this compilation lacks.Brendel's mozart sonatas sound better for me, however he has not recorded all of them in a single complilation such as this."
5,Its some awesome emo,"This CD rocks from start to end, its a great piece of music that is perfect for any collection..."
3,Watch out for you Amazon Purchase,"I rented this movie from Netflix and liked it, especially the additional features (deleted scenes, commentary, cast interviews, bloopers) but when I got the movie from Amazon, NONE OF THIS IS THERE! It is just the movie. Don't know where to get the whole thing. UGH!"
4,Sexy people,"The film is a keeper for the eye-candy alone. I really love looking at these people. They are all good enough to eat. The acting was good. I didn't think much of the plot, but the sex scenes are the best. It's worth it just for the scenery. Yeah. Music isn't half bad either. Where can I locate the soundtrack??????"
2,Anybody else sick of stubble and dirty hair?,"I am SICK of guys who look like Thomas Dekker: pale, androgynous, black-haired pretty boys with stubble and stringy hair hanging in front of their eyes. There must be a factory somewhere that cranks them out like Edsels. This might have been an interesting movie if Araki had made him shave and wash his hair.Certainly the idea of an Araki horror movie is intriguing, and maybe he'll try again in a few years after the tiresome stubble/messy hair craze has died (Isn't it dead YET?!). I did manage to get through the movie, but it was not as good as it could have been with a different star, or with the same star after a shampoo and shave. His acting is fine; it's his look that seems about ten years out of date and is so tiresome it's distracting."
2,Not so much KABOOM as KERPLUNK,"Araki is imitating recent entries in the genre of extreme cinema (like SHORTBUS) but he has crafted something derivative and forgettable. This movie is short, fast, colorful, and supremely superficial. Wilde's famous epigram seems ironically suitable here: those who look beneath the surface do so at their own peril. In this case, there's nothing underneath the glossy, sexy cover. The ultimate cinematic c*ck-tease. In the end, I think it's Araki's desire to be ultra hip that undoes this film. When fashion and taste have moved on, this movie will remain mired in its own particular cultural moment. And that in and of itself is ok, since many great films end up that way. But that's all there is to this movie-- no commentary, no message, no critique. Just low-budget teenage sexcapades with all the depth of an uninspired fashion spread. it's intensely disappointing. MYSTERIOUS SKIN was an incredible film. This is a big letdown for Araki fans."
4,Confusing and surprising!,"The first time I watched this I was utterly confused, but I liked it. The second time, I loved it. I bought it mostly for Thomas Dekker, he's gorgeous, and this wasn't available to rent in my town. I am pleased with my purchase though, it kinda has a sexed up Donnie Darko feel to it. The reviews were really bad for this movie, but the good ones usually do have bad reviews. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it is a good and pretty watch:-)"
5,A Complimentary Must Have,"The Study Guide is the perfect companion to the Human Resources Management Tenth Edition textbook. The Study Guide provides excellent review questions in the form of True/False, Multiple Choice, Matching, Essay and Fill-ins. At the end of each question, the corresponding page number of the textbook is provided for quick reference/review. The study guide will test your ability to retain information. I highly recommend it, especially for those that are preparing for the PHR/SPHR exams."
2,Save your money if you are studying for the PHR or SPHR exams,"I brought this study guide in addition to the book to study for the PHR exam. I barely used it because I didn't feel this was a good prep tool for the exam. All the questions are laid out per chapter, which I am sure is good for it's intended purpose of classroom study in college, but not for prep on a test that is going to answer questions in all different sorts of order. Save your money to just buy the book and leave the study guide for the college students."
2,tai pan in chinese,in the 2007 edition of the tai pan movie alot of the film contains only English subtitiles and much of the time the actors were speaking chinese so I was not happy with this production If you speak only English like I do then this 2007 dvd is not for you..rk.swim@gmail.com
3,okay purchase,"they sure didn't waste a lot of money remaking this one! However, the service was FAST and the movie arrived in original packaging and in great condition!"
4,Great Replacement!,"I bought this to replace my old struts and have had no issues. Only con would be the packaging from amazon, the box the struts came in looked like it was being held together by tape. I would buy this product again."
4,Very good deal,"Very very nice for the price, and really perked up our bedroom....and I got to have another chuckle, when at a local store, saw their down comforters on sale, of similar quality, for more than twice the price......one note, I ordered a King for our Queen bed, and thought it was just right for it."
5,TOUGH,THIS WAS A CHALLENING BOOK TO READ. THE WORDS WERE OUT OF THE READING CAPACITY BECAUSE I WAS NOT FAMILIAR LANGUAGE. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO REFERENCE TO IF YOU WERE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE WRITER.
4,A map for the expanse of the Human being,True to the word integral Wilber has done much for bringing together multiple frames to present a more cohesive picture of human beings. Integral Thinking is a must for any practising professional in mental health or helping professions. It allows a way of understanding the context and facets of mental health and wellbeing. It allows a practioner to work with an understanding of surrounding professions and their contribution to treatment.
3,What about something new?,"I am a big fan of Wilber. I am using him as a central point in my dissertation. So take the following comment for what it's worth:Come on Ken, what about something new? We've read about the spectrum of consciousness, holons, the four quadrants and so on for years. Anyone with Vol. 4 of your Collected Works has the charts in this text and so doesn't need to buy itPlease, let us hear something new!"
3,ROUTER,GOOD ROUTER FOR SMALL JOBS.ONLY ONE THIS WRONG.AFTER RUNNING SPEED CONTROL SWITCH SLOWS DOWN FROM VIB.HAVE TO TURN BACK UP ALL THE TIME.
1,Quality Bath Repair,I got my new router yesterday and I noticed on the box it was made in Mexico All my older porter cable tool are made in USA and the one amazon ha pictured here is as well I gess the tool is fine but i hate the fact you cant buy american made tools anymore after all they are an american company right
5,awasum router,my first porter cable router - beats the heck out of major store brand i had. works with my router lift. plenty of power.
4,simple to use and inexpensive enough for a beginner,"I've used my 690 for close to 2 years now without a problem. It has power to spare and is rock solid. It has outperformed every other tool in my shop. In many cases I've found a way to use a router in lieu my other tools. I have great confidence it will last for many years. My dad's 690 is over 10 years old and still running strong (I've put a few hours on that one too!)I use it exclusively for hand work using the fixed and plunge bases provided, opting instead to use the bigger 7518 in my router table.I highly recommend this router to anyone. It is simple to use and inexpensive enough for a beginner, but sturdy and precise enough for a serious woodworker."
4,Good quality for the price,I purchased this router so that I can leave it attached to my routed table and leave my other router free. My shop is used for making fine furniture as a hobby and I did not need a heavy duty machine. This one tots the bill.
3,Middling Model,"Purchased because of Porter-Cable reputation and the attractive price. Have not used it long enough to judge its durability, but at this point am moderately satisfied: not bad, but not distinguishably good, either. Pleasing attributes: adequate power and accuracy. Annoyances: base plate opening diameter too small for many bits, bit changing comparatively laborious, soft switch response fussy. The 690LR model seems middling -- better than some other brands at lower prices, not up to other Porter-Cable cable models or other brands at higher prices. Check other reviews for extended use quality and durability."
3,Pretty good router,"Okay, I haven't used this router much. My router table had issues, so I borrowed a friend's, which had this router mounted in it. It worked okay, and I know Porter Cable is the standard when it comes to routers, but I was very unimpressed.To adjust the height, you twist the body and clamp it down when you get the height you want. This is very awkward in a table, and I never got the bit at exactly the right height. The 890 series (and my Freud router) has a screw to adjust the height which works MUCH better. Also, since the base and the motor are both aluminum, they don't glide smoothly.For a simple hand held router, I am sure this is a very good choice. For table mounting, this thing leaves a lot to be desired."
1,New models not up to old standards,I have purchased 6 of these units over the last 20 years. They seemed to last and last until the final two I purchased last year. The armatures went out with in a year on both of them. The quality of the winding must be way cheapened from the old ones that have kept going with a simple brush replacement. I will be looking at other brands for my next purchase.
3,router review,"excellent price,not to pleased with the depth/height adjustment but works well in my router table! of coarse a speed control is how to override its not being variable speed!"
5,the best router!,"this router is the work horse of routers. it is strong and can do any job whether your a framing carpenter, routing window openings, or a finish carpenter, machining doors.this is my third router and i still have the very first 690LR that i bought. i use all three everyday as a finish carpenter. i absolutely love them."
5,the perfect first router,"I have the older 1.5hp version of the 690. I haven't used the updated one but the basics are the same. It glides through wood without hesitation regardless of the bit style or depth(within reason of course). It spends 95% of it's time in my router table where it lives quite happily. In this application, I find it to be ideal for my hobby needs. Even the older screw-type motor lock works well.If you are looking for a first router or one to put under a table, look no further, you've found it. The only thing that is a drag is having to use two wrenches to change bits, but not many routers in this class have a spindle lock. The collet design is outstanding, by the way, so you don't have to worry about bits sticking."
5,Dovetail Maker,"This is a nice little router. It is an excellent companion to the Porter-Cable Omni-Jig dovetail machine. It's about medium weight, as routers go. It is well balanced. The low mounted handles allow the user total control while routing. When cutting, it sends the sawdust in the direction of about 8:00, instead of in your face. The template guides for this router (sold seperately) will fit all Porter-Cable routers, and are very likely the easiest to install in the industry. The depth ring is very easy to use. It's measured in 1/32"". That's one of the reasons that it's so compatable with the Omni-Jig... It's also set up on a 1/32"" system. The only drawback that I have found with this router is the location of the on-off switch. It's a little bit awkward. Outside of that, This is a good little router. I am well pleased.J. E. Zottoli"
4,Routers,The 690 Router is great for the use I put to it. The 2 wrench procedure is outmoded but the large size of the tools make them easy to find.
4,Solid Router,"Very good all around unit. Bit changes and depth control are not issues at all. Why anyone would put the on/off switch in a position where you have to take one hand off the unit is a good question most have noted. Not a good choice for a table set up, mine was intended for hand use only."
3,SOMEWHAT STRESS INDUCING,"when i first bought it and played it i found it quite relaxing, i would assume from the associations in my mind between the sounds of the surf and experiences i have had at beaches. but after playing it a lot, the association changed to being in my study, and the constant pounding of the waves became anything but relaxing. dont get me wrong, this cd is very good, but just not something i can listen to over and over (which was really what i wanted it for)."
3,these are good for teaching numbers,"these little puzzles are good for teaching young ones to count, they are not as durable as i like but they are a good product for reaching numbers and the puzzle format is good for hand and eye coordination, and dexterity"
4,"Fun, educational toy","This is a great game to encourage number recognition and counting. Some of the smaller pieces can be difficult for little fingers to put back, but with time they catch on. Now, that my daughter has mastered the numbers and shapes we line numbers up in order and practice counting forwards and backwards. I recommend keeping the pieces in a Ziploc bag as it is easy to lose the smaller shapes."
2,Urgh!,"I really had to force myself to finish this one (I usually love the Mates, Dates books). It was boring and after 3 chapters I got really tired of Izzie's whining about her weight. She only gained about 8 pounds and was freaking out. I had to force myself to finish this one. Not only was it boring it was too preachy as well. I felt like Hopkins was trying to warn us of the dangers of dieting in a very heavy handed way.This book is NOT recommended!"
1,It ain't what it used to be.,"Like so many of the recent changes at IBD, the new IBD 2005 Desk Diary falls short. It is poorly constructed and the informative content of the newest diary is less than half of the 2004 version. Also, whereas the excellent format of the pages in the 2004 version was designed to help traders/investors in tracking their potential stock picks, the 2005 looks like an ordinary calender. It is essentially useless.I'm a long-time subscriber to IBD. Considering the horrible format changes to the newspaper, I'm not at all surprised to see the 2005 Desk Diary has gone the way of the dogs."
3,Not really a 'Desk' Diary...,"O'Neil is the author of some fine books on investing and that is why I jumped at the chance to purchase this new diary-type book.My evaluation follows.Pros:1) There is a small paragraph of good investing advice for every day of the year(2004 only). For example: ""Don't trade on news... it can shake you out. Understand the company and how they are really doing before reacting to a single news item on the company.""2) It's spiral-bound, which makes it very easy to write in.3) Nice small size makes it unobstrusive in your briefcase.Cons:1) With two days on each page, there is very little room to write anything of substance. Just barely enough space to jot down 'Stocks to watch' & 'Today's Trades' on the small lines provided.2) No factual information included from the authors past books. Only contains ""Quotes"", which probably aren't even his.In closing, I will have to recommend:""The Stock Trader's Almanac 2004"""
1,Tedious and...tedious,"Hearing Sarah's pieces on ""This American Life"" is amusing in a low-key way. Reading her smug, ill-informed opinions page after page is just boring."
1,"""Radio On"" Puts Reader Off!","Vowell has some insight into her subject, probably about as much as the average radio listener. To (over) compensate, she makes grasping, unsubstantiated comparisons to other media. The tone is self-absorbed, which is fine when the author has more personality than this one."
4,you try this at home and see what you find.,"this book is a diary of an entire year's worth of listening to the radio. most people only listen in their cars, but sarah didn't have a tv or something, so she kept a journal of what she heard on the radio. in some cities, this would be the most boring task and picking your belly button lint would be more fun. but she was lucky enough to live in a place where they take their radio seriously. this isn't anything like take the cannoli, but don't let that stop you. it's an incredible sociological experiment. plus it also helps that she's employed by npr. sort of."
1,"This book is great if you like pompous, pretentious, pseudo-intellectuals!","I love ""This American Life"". I love ""The Incredibles"". I hate Sarah Vowell. She is rude and mean, and I wonder what gives her the right to think she is so much better than all those mass-cultured, uneducated people she scorns so much. I'm a 20-something, college educated, art-loving female punk musician from New York City (have I impressed you yet, Sarah??), and I am certainly unimpressed by Sarah Vowell's ability to randomly name-drop and brag about the artists, musicians, and authors she likes. Her condescending tone and mundane analyses of life leave much to be desired. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who actually knows a thing about art, music, or life."
1,Refund Requested,"I have read all four of Sarah Vowell's books. I believe that is all of them. I thoroughly enjoyed three of them and would strongly recommend them. With for Radio On, her first book, she seems to be in a different place. Radio On is a diary of Sarah listening to the radio. Although the concept is interesting, the result is a lot of very short entries in which there is little opportunity to develop anything. But the real reason I didn't like Radio On is because of Sarah's perspective at that time. She is a very critical person in this book. Nirvana is the greatest band ever, and The Grateful Dead is worthless. Whether it is music, politics, or a variety of other topics, you get the clear impression that her opinion is right and any others are wrong. Radio On is a very mean and negative view of life and our world. The worst case scenario, though, is someone reads Radio On first and doesn't read Sarah Vowell's other books. That would be huge mistake."
1,Let's be frank...,"Here's the long and short of it: Sarah Vowell is a whiney bore, a genius of the obvious who makes it very easy for folks to make fun of the entire NPR culture."
5,Refills for my 23 year old Tombo Super Pen,Just received my refills for my Tombo Super Pen that I have been using for 23 years. Cartriges fit perfectly and ink rolls smoothly.
5,Dining On a Dime,"Great cook book! Lots of money saving tips and advice. Simple recipes that are easy to follow, quick, and made with ingredients that are simple and easy to find. This book even has recipes for items that are hard to find like crackers (great!) Gives wonderful craft tips and recipes for gifts, and bath and body care. I have never seen another cookbook like this one. (Good Stuff) ! ! !"
3,So-So,"The book is OK. The author sometimes repeats phrases and tips, and there are quite a few typos in the book. But it has some good tips and nice recipes."
4,A lot like Tightwad Gazette only lots of recipes,"I think this is a great book, but if you one Tightwad Gazette, you might want to just borrow this one. There are a lot of recipes though, but not any new information."
4,Lots of good information,I am a person that tries to use natural products a much as possible.When I discovered this book I ordered it based on the fact that it contains plenty of homemade recipes for everything from food to general cleaning.This book does not disappoint.This book makes it very easy to live inexpensively and naturally.After reading this book you will see just how much money is wasted on products which can be made at home for pennies on the dollar.
2,It's a cookbook.,"I have many, many cookbooks that span decades. This one, well, it isn't very good. Honestly, the food is very bland. I made one of the ""Mexican-ish"" casseroles. It was so bland that it almost tasted like I had just doused it in ketchup. I should have tasted the dish, and fixed it before hand. The make ahead mixes are not very good either. Seriously, I really expected more. If you are looking at buying this one, you would be better off just doing a few online searches for frugal, recipes, & cooking. The tips are obvious basics like buy stuff that your family eats on sale. Not rocket science. This book is just an example of good marketing. It truly is not worth it."
4,An updated Just Not Beans,"I like the updated version with a different title. It's something I will refer to over and over. I just wonder how she does what she does, knowing how CFS, in additon to Fibro,can put one down for days."
2,Eh.,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The recipes, for the most part, really aren't all that cheap because many of them rely heavily on meat and canned/packaged foods. More-with-less (Herald Press) gives much more economical recipes built around truly inexpensive ingredients such as rice and dried lentils.This book does have a few redeeming qualities, though. The recipes are probably quicker than those in More-with-less, and I suspect they would be more kid-friendly (I can't say for sure because I don't have kids.) Also, I use the recipes for homemade cleaning products."
4,About what I expected,"I ordered this mirror for my 85 Toyota truck because the after market one that was on it would fold in at highway speeds. This one solved the problem and looks like the factory original. My only issue with it is it seems to be kind of cheaply made, but the price was right. I guess time will tell."
4,Solid but not spectacular,Features Elvin Jones on drums. Recorded in 1957 in a single session in New York City. Rare session worth owning.
5,An incredible book!,"This book is absolutely amazing. Fr. Corbon provides a masterful contemplative reflection about the mystery of the liturgy and how it needs to be lived. He brilliantly refocuses the debate that rages in modern circles about rules and rubrics to be about reascending to the source and rediscovering the Trinity as the source and font of the liturgy.The first section of the book can be a somewhat difficult read because the language used is the fruit of contemplation. It needs to be read with prayer and meditation in order for the full effect of what Fr. Corbon is proposing to be realized.I believe that all Christians, but most especially Catholics should put this at the top of their reading list. It will give you a completely new understanding of the liturgy and in many cases will probably change your life.Overall it is one of the best books that I have ever read."
2,Spatial,"The CD title could have been named ""Galaxy Ave"", because the music is, in effect, spatial. Do not buy this CD, hoping for fantastic arrangements by the Euro group ""Dancing Fantasy"" because it's not there. Universal Ave, in my opinion, has a watered-down Techno sound. But still, I'm amazed with the blending of a real instrument(electric guitar) and programmable keyboards, to produce moonscape sounds. And though ""Universal Ave"" is not a Dancing Fantasy arrangement, the packaging and verbiage is suggestive that it is. I bought it anyway, and am not altogether disapointed."
2,Transformers fans only,"When I returned from the store with new transformers DVD , rebirth, i thought I was going to be thoroghly entertained. I had already watched the Transformers THe Movie DVD , which turned out to be a great flick. My expectations were high. As the first episode played out , my jaw dropped ! What was this garbage? The animation was sub-par , and the voice-acting hideous. The only familiar voice was the Optimus Prime VA , who sounded a little worse for wear. If you're used to the first season of Transformers , you'll hate these episodes. I mean , the older episodes had way better plot ,storyline and animation. C'mon , ""NEW HEADMASTERS , NEW TARGERMASTERS!"" . That is the worst promo i've ever heard. Anyway , I'll quote the main villian to wrap this review up "" Remove your heads!"" And remove your expectations for this sham of a DVD."
3,Confused hectic series should have been a movie.,"This SHORT series should have been another movie. It suffered from several problems as a series, however. Because they shoved so much new stuff into 3 made for TV episodes, the story line is way over-compressed. It also seems like it's almost nothing but a plug for a bunch of new transformers that they never had enough time in the series to develop and then make for toy production (and thence, more money). So, what the viewer gets is a story that seems almost entirely monetarily based to generate revenue on a bunch of new Transformers before the series ended. Despite this being a fictitious story line, these episodes take the ridiculous to a whole new level, even when one accepts the basic tenements of the Transformers in general. These three episodes have enough in them for a properly written STORY (read: movie or another year's worth of episodes). Overall, it's good closure for a Transformers fan, but erringly schizophrenic."
5,Transformers HERO'S real REBIRTH,"I received the corrected version of this DVD and it is excellent. Complete with scenes from the past episodes of the episode Rebirth and the future episodes of Rebirth from the cool narrator, this DVD is a must. This is the final episode ever shown in the United States of this classic show. One comment I would like to make. I do not like the choice of pictures that Rhino uses for this DVD or the Villians DVD. On the villians cover it shows Cyclonus, well he was never in the episode The Ultimate Doom except as his prior form ((Skywarp) I have a good theory about why Cyclonus is Skywarp due to Transformers the Movie's vague error that has haunted Transformer fans for years). The hero's DVD version has Optimus Prime but he is not the main focus of this episode. Other than that the Rebirth is digitalized and the three part episode looks better than ever. Targetmasters and Headmasters attack."
4,Transformers Vol 1 - Prime Threat,"All in All, Prime Threat was outstanding, It kept me interested to the point that I intend on collecting the whole Transformer Series from Amazon.com"
4,words can't describe this episode,"a must see for any transformer fan.its great seeing optimus prime back as leader and also we see the best duo in my opinion hot rod and cop back together.we see a few older autobots and descepticons like the ariel-bots,combaticons,constructicons even a chaged bumble bee whos now""gold bug""and part of the prodel bot .. my only disappointment was that the dinobots were no where to be seen but the headmasters and target masters made up for that .a must see for all buy u'l enjoy"
1,Duplication Error?,"I bought this and the Villains DVD at the same time... but they both have the same content!... I popped it in, and sure enough... it's got the same 3 episodes on it as the Villains DVD..."
5,Wonderful jazz c.d.,"Not only does Aaron Weinstein make the violin swing on this c.d. but the company he keeps is amazing: Houston Person, Bucky and John Pizzarelli, Joe Ascione. Nat Hentoff says it best in his Wall Street Journal article, ""This session should bring renewed interest in the often overlooked heritage of the jazz violin while heralding the advent of an unmistakably personal improviser who can be intimately tender as well as so fierily invigorating that you have to move to his music."""
5,Outstanding CD,A jazz fan's dream CD - excellent selections and masterfully played. A definite high recommendation!
2,More words the wow......,"This book is very lengthy 791 pages to be exact, it's all black and white and a lot more words then pictures, mine came with a CD which is ok. But, if your looking for an in-depth book about Photoshop 6 you have found it. I rated it a 2 because I personally like a bit more pictures and color."
3,Hoping,I haven't had a chance to use it yet. I'm hoping it will work well. It has a good reputation.
3,Had to return,The TV was great but you need to use cable and I was putting it in the basement and it was going to be a hassle for the cable company to install a cable in that room. I bought the best antenna but it didn't work. The description should have included that cable was necessary. The remote didn't work either. Amazon was great about taking the return.
5,Portable TV/DVD/CD That's Best Quality and Price!,"The AXN-7080 has it all! Whether you like to watch a movie, TV or listen to your favorite CD's, this is the best quality at a Discount price! The best part is that it's portable for going on trips! My dad mounted our player in the corner of our travel trailer and now we enjoy the versatility and comforts of home!"
5,Happy Camper,"Excellent value - pleased with size (fits nicely into a small space, e.g., cupboard), color, clarity, sound, ease of installation, and operating use."
2,No Antenna Reception,"This is a great little portable tv if you will be using it with cable outlet or DVD. I strongly do not recommend this tv if you plan to use it with an antenna. We originally bought the tv to use while camping in places where we don't always have cable access. We can't even pick up our local channels in our home using the best antennas money could buy. Called customer service and they were very unhelpful...told us that if the tv picked up cable channels, then there was nothing wrong with the tv reception. Cust Serv continued to tell us that we had poor reception in our home. However, we pick up all local channels with every other tv in our home using the same antennas we tried with this tv. I am going to send this tv back while it is still under warranty!"
4,Good TV for the kitchen,"This is a nice little TV/DVD system.It's small, wall mountable and has a 90 degree F connector for connecting a regular coax cable instead of just using RCA cables.The picture quality is good and the sound quality is acceptable but not great. Played DVDs, CDs, MP3 Cds and jpeg CDs fine.If the sound quality had been better I would have given it 5 stars."
2,parts missing & customer service not available,i got this to have at our home for our grandson but it came with no remote although the box stated one was included plus it didn't seem to work in our home with our cable service and after calling customer service several times and only getting voice mail.....i felt it might be a sign that this product was a lemon and i'd better cut my loses and return it! it may just have been the ONE that i received but it didn't seem like an American made high quality item. Again it may only have been ONE lemon and the rest may all be super....but i'm only commenting on my experience so you can weigh your decision to buy or not on that. =D
5,***** W O W *****,"Very rarely am I so impressed where I feel compelled to write up an optional review of something I purchase. But in this case im happy to take the time to do so. My reason for buying this product was to keep informed of news and weather condition's during power outages, I have a 1500 Volt Ampre UPS battery back-ups system hooked up to this TV and between it's very modest voltage requirements, DVD feature, and of course TV capability, It's worked out astronomically well..........The performance and quality of service/reception it provide's is second to NOTHING ive used in the past. Im a 2-Way radio comm's tekky type person, and always beleived in being prepared for the un-expected, but I must stress the point as to how well this little TV work's & what a fine fit and finish the company put into it's production of this DVD/TV/Video Display unit. Thank's Amazon.Com for offering it to us, and for the fine website choices I had available to me. Respectfully Yours....Frank."
2,Buyer be ware,"I brought these shoes last year!. When i brought them i put them up for a couple of months for i can wear them on my birthday, So the day came i was all excited and put them on with in 25min of walking in them they started detaching for the soles!!!!!. Their glued on to the sole, it jus came all apart!!!!. It was soooo embarrassing thank god we were leaving the move theater, so i would not recommend this for anyone!. But they are soo comfortable man i regret the way they made them!"
1,Crappy Shoe,I purchased these shoes and on the first time wearing them the sold pulled apart and the little straps pulled out of the sole. I was not given a refund or eschange. Worthless.
1,Waste of money,This product crashed my computer as soon as I hooked it up. I haven't been willing to try it again.
2,Rosamond Bernier's lecture on Modern Art and Manners,"I was disappointed in this lecture. There is nothing actually wrong with it (no errors, film problems, etc.) but it does not provide any insights that aren't available in a basic art history book. The speaker is not particularly engaging and does not offer a unique personal viewpoint."
5,What's Black About It?,"This is an absolute must-read for those in the advertising/marketing profession but especially those whose focus is specifically African American advertising. I especially encourage those new to the field to grab a copy ""What's Black About It?"" because in spite of all of the research, time and preparation it takes to produce a client presentation, at the end some clients still ask the proverbial question - ""What's Black About It?""This is handy tool that brings to the forefront new insights and dispells stereotypes. For those in this industry, you'll find that you spend more time educating clients about who African Americans really are and how much they impact EVERYTHING; ""What's Black About It?"" is filled with statistics and facts that make the ride much smoother. I give this book two thumbs up and encourage all to purchase. Thanks Pepper and Herb for a job well done.A. SikesStrategic Planner"
3,different,"I bought this cd cause i am a listener of Emperor( mortiis's old band). I thought this would be a normal black-metal cd when i bought it. At first i listend to track num.1 only hearing weird old sounds, i thought it would all of the sudden get better and heavy...but it didnt i then noticed how the whole cd was related to the first track. I was pretty mad at first but i started to like the nice melody to it. I still wouldent reccomend this to some one who likes Metal cause this is nothing like it."
2,what in GODS name is this!,"First off, I have no idea if Mortiis is trying to be serious with his ugly face. He looks like my grandma on a leathal overdose of LSD and cocaine combined. Second I LOVE Emperor, yet this album makes me wonder why in gods name did Emperor get a ugly troll dude like Mortiis to be in there band in the early years. Third, where is all the like vocals and guitars and stuff. I really cant stand this battle music crap like Bal Sagoth and now Mortiis. Battle music is a discrace to blackmetal and all the bands alike. I give this 2 stars cause like 1 song is good and plus, the dude is from emperor. Buy it man. im not stoping you."
5,Spurgeon's Sermons on Sovereignty,"This book contains a biographical sketch of C. H. Spurgeon, followed by 18 of his sermons, in which he explains and defends as Scriptural the Calvinistic view of salvation. Most of them are taken from the early years of his ministry in London, when he was very concerned about establishing his congregation on a solid doctrinal foundation. Despite having been preached 150+ years ago, these sermons are still quite readable today, probably because Spurgeon avoiding being university-educated and infected with the ""preach to impress other scholars"" virus. He preached to inform and edify the folks in the pews, thus his continued popularity today. This collection is well worth reading!"
2,Unsatisfactory performance and broken in less than a month!,"I ordered this product on July 30th and received it on August 7th or so. I put it to use that evening and its performance was 'okay'.It simply just does not brew an acceptable espresso - I've tried a few different coffees that I've used in the past with no problem. On a high note, the frother works like a charm!Well, it did anyway... two evenings ago I went to make a chai latte. Everything was going fine until I went to froth the milk and turned the knob to allow steam out of the system. When I turned the knob it exploded! All of the steam built up released out of the side through the hole where the knob was at and the knob and the hardware it's connected to is hanging loose inside of the machine.I'm making a warranty claim on the item this evening. I'm not even sure I'll use it when I get it back..."
1,A Sample Beat CD ..........,"You ever tried to a music making program with those 20 lame beats programed in? ... Think boring.. Think Bi God 20 - Supercute, with a scratch so it loops over and over every ten seconds... I have their ep Combat! .. Excellent, I recomend it to anyone who is into club-ish music.. This is more of like VERY VERY primative industrial.. and boring.."
5,Great Historical Collection,"Any collection of all nine Beethoven symphonies is likely to have some great recordings and some not-so-great ones, and this collection is no exception. On balance, however, if you appreciate the Toscanini style (generally fast paced), this group ranks very close to the 1963 Karajan with the Berlin SO and right there with Walter and the Columbia SO. Plus, this is the most economical way to get Toscanini's recordings of the third, seventh and ninth, so the others are a ""bonus."""
2,Substandard recording,"On ALL the CDs in this collection a very storng and audible hissing can be heard. Initially I thought my sound system has gone mad, but other CDs - not from this set - sound just fine.What a pitty, since the music and the performance are excellent (I guess)."
5,Had been longing to hear these again. Loved it.,"I was raised on these recordings, on 33 1/3. Loved every second of it. The quality of these remastered recordings is excellent."
5,The famous original Toscanini NBC recordings,"This is the true original item, with all its original defects and its exciting moments. The performances are as thrilling for me as they were 40 years ago!! The cream of the crop in my opinion is Toscanini's Eroica, the second movement is unparallelled by any other performance. So is the 9th, especially with Jan Pierce's extraordinary tenor. Yet throughout there are special moments, even the 4th sparkles.The sound is generally below standard even for the early 50s, for the 9th it is acceptable. I find the coughing in some of the performances (which were concert performances) like the 3rd adds to the authenticity. You know these recordings were not spliced, and they carry the thrill of authentic performances!!"
3,Pseudo-stereo alert,"Please be aware that to varying degrees, these recordings have some sort of pseudo-stereo or ambiance effect added in the remastering. The channels are clearly NOT in phase. Although the amount of phase shift varies among the discs, you are not getting true monaural sound. Whether this is an improvement or not is of course strictly a matter of personal preference."
5,Very informative and complete,"This book is a must own for every health/fitness enthusiast. It details all parts of an exercise program, explaining their importance, and how they correlate for a complete plan. Whether you are exercising for strength, muscle shaping and conditioning, or better overall health and well-being, this book will show you step-by-step how to get there. For people who active fitness buffs, this book will only enhance your current routine.I know Ed Burke from my college days and there is not a better leading expert in health and fitness around that is as knowledgable and can instruct with real-world examples and advice. Buy this book and you won't be disappointed."
3,Nice little TV,"The picture is good. Light weight. The little stand is very useful.There is no ""Built-in charger with 4 NiMH rechargeable batteries"" in this package !"
3,Does What I Need It To.,"I bought the AXN5327A primarily for work. I use it to test out video lines at television sporting events. In this capacity it works as expected, using a not-included video input cable. The antenna interferes with the video input port, but it's a minor gripe. As a TV It's marginal. I've tried to tune in stations inside TV trucks (not a good location, often cellphones don't work) with mixed results. I haven't tested it extensively but if you fiddle with the antenna and you are near (line-of-sight) a TV station's transmitter, you could get an acceptable signal. Outdoors at a staudium high in the stands could be an ideal location for good reception. It reminds me of a portable black and white TV of years ago but in color and smaller. In fact it's size is a plus for me; very portable!"
2,In convenient TV,It's too small and signal is too weak. The life of battery is too short.Not recomment to buy this. You can find some other model better quality.
2,Very poor reception,"I bought this TV to pick up Armed Forces Network signals at my base in Iraq (transmitted from ON the base, BTW), and all I get is a very poor picture and sound I can barely hear. The reception is worthless in my opinion, so I packaged it up and sent it to my son back home...thanks Axion, I had to go out and buy a regular TV for $99, which works perfectly with the enclosed rabbit ears."
2,*ATENTION what about DTV change over? ATTENTION*,But Will this small tv work after the DTV change over? thats my biggest question.
5,Eye opening experience,"I caught a special on the Documentary Channel called ""Coming to Light: Edward Curtis"". I realized right then and there that I had to see this book they were talking about: The North American Indian. This is truly a ONE-OF-A-KIND book. I leave this book out on my coffee table and it gets attention. And because it's mostly pictures, my 7 year old daughter loves it. The most beautiful and meaningful collection of photos ever. I wish more people knew of it. What Curtis went through to make this is equally intriguing as the book itself. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT."
3,"Edward S. Curtis' best book, The North American Indian","The paperback version of this book is somewhat small, 5 1/2 x 7 3/4, so the pictures inside are quite small, making it hard to really accurately see the Indians. Many of the photos came out fairly dark, so the images are not clear and sharp. It does, however, chronicle the entire portfolio which Curtis completed in his original book. Since you can't usually find the original, this is the best you can get. Would be better in a larger format, however. Very interesting text."
1,paperback version,"Disappointed with this version, the content is exceptional but the book is just to small to really show off the photos."
1,Not what I thought,"I looked at the available contents of this book. There were supposed to be over 700 pages to this book, but the book I received only had 218. I am very disappointed in this book. It was not at all what was advertised. Why put those contents when they are not in the book that I received!!!The North American Indian"
3,"Sounds great, but it already broke ...","I bought this unit, the car kit and the boombox last January. The sound is great, the installation in the car was easy. My only complaint is that the lights are out on my unit. It still plays, but I can't see anything on the screen or any of the buttons at night. Clarion will repair it, but that means I will be without it for 4-6 wks. That sucks."
2,Be Careful - Do not use if you have history of Eating disorders,This tea is basically a laxative - thats it... easy to abuse and overuse.. be very careful if you are going to use this product. It will take your insides out!
1,Does not play nice-nice with XP,"For raid-0 had to shut the computer off after the file copy process and physically move the card to a new pci slot to get it to work off of a fresh format. After that, many blue sreens and freezes. Ended up pulling the card and just keeping the hard drives as two seperate drives. All in all not worth the (cheap) price. More of a pain in the @$$ than anything.In case you were wondering, I have a very good pc (dell 4300 w/ p3 1.8) with A LOT of bells and whistles. This should have not performed this poorly on the pc I built."
3,"It does the job for me, not a stellar product","Adaptec is reselling the Highpoint RocketRAID 100 as their own product. This is not a hardware RAID implementation, but the BIOS on the card support booting from the RAID array, which would otherwise be impossible using RAID0. The chip used (HPT370A) is nothing but a ATA100 controller, and can be used as such.All the magic is in the drivers. Adaptec only supports Windows OSes, but it actually works out of the box for FreeBSD, and Linux supports the chipset as well. I'm running a RAID1 configuration for a file server, using matched HDs. Read performance is noticably faster, and write performance does not seem to have suffered much.One issue: when one drive fails the RAID1 keeps on running, but rebooting requires manual intervention at the console until the drive is replaced and the mirror rebuilt.It's not an issue for me, but continuing the boot after a timeout would have been nice."
3,Cheap way to protect your data or improve performance,"This is a good solution for the home user who is looking for either faster transfers from his hard drives (RAID 0) or to secure his data (RAID 1). I use it on my Windows XP system and never had any problems. It's easy to install and configure. Windows XP supports it natively, but you should get the latest drivers and BIOS to support drives larger than 137GB.The down sides, in my opinion:. Doesn't offer RAID 3 (parity: 3 drives give you the capacity of 2 with the benefits of RAID 1) or RAID 5.. In RAID 1 mode, it only supports 2 drives, even if you have 4. You cannot, for example, mirror a set of 200 GB + 60 GB drives to form a mirrored 260GB drive.. No drivers offered for Linux.It is a good idea to read more about the different types of RAID before purchasing your RAID adapter.For about the same price, the Promise FastTrak SX4000 offers a much better product that supports RAID 5 and up to 256MB of on-board cache memory."
3,very good,Cougar. This movie is mild today. Espeacially when it's the lastest thing to date a man 10 to 15 yrs younger than you. The movie was good and enjoyable. If you are in love go for it and don't let no one else tell you other wise.
4,A Lovely Slice of Melodrama,"This is a great film that you will be able to laugh at for all its pure melodramatic simplicity and at the same time despair over the loveable characters and tragic situations portrayed. You have to wonder at a time that could be so innocent that it all ever came down to whether or not the boy and girl get together. The dialogue is rich with subtext and you'll see all the glorious complexities of tense gender relations and homoerotic subplot working unbeknownst right in front of the character's eyes. Of course, the idyllic Thoreauean life vs comfortable suburban existence is weak, but you can't expect much more in a melodrama. What's important is to maintain a humorous belief of the characters and their innocent struggle to be happy. The scene where the Wyman receives a television is one of the most heart-wrenching I've witnessed. It is a joyous and entertaining film."
2,Waaaaay to melodramatic,"I have to admit up front that I am not a fan of too much melodrama. I had to laugh out loud at a few scenes that were just too sappy. It was a nice movie, but definitely not one that I would ever watch again or add to my collection."
4,As real as romance can get.,"An adult romance, very well written and acted by all. I highly recommend it."
1,Disappointing...,"I had hoped that this book would be a good reference manual for learning and teaching the various throws and takedowns of this art. In short, while the (very)few arts that were covered seemed to explained fairly well, this book does not seem to do the art of judo much justice. There is just not enough material in the book. Also...the extra large print used in the book made it seem that the publisher was using the large print-type just to take up space...if they had not...the book could have been condensed into a pamphlet.In short...put your money towards other books with more ""meat"" to them. I'm sending mine back to Amazon for a refund."
2,What a disappointment.,I found this book to be a sorry excuse for product advertisement. I own both the grill and rotisserie. I was hoping for recipes to help me learn how to use them. The rotisserie recipes were basically non-existant. I did not learn any thing from this book then what came with either the grill and/or rotisserie. Don't waste your money. Go to a good recipe exchange list and they will have what you need.
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping that this book would contain healthy grilling directions to be used with the George Forman grill. This book is not related to his grill at all. Also, none of the recipes in this book met our low fat eating habits. There were only a couple fish recipes and all the vegeatble recipes were to be prepared on the side, not on the grill."
1,Disappointed,"This is not the companion cookbook for the famous George Foreman grill that we had assumed it would be. It is just another ""barbeque"" cookbook and the kind we like least--recipes calling for ingredients not ordinarily found in our kitchen."
1,wheres the rotisserie recipes,it seems to me if you are going to sell a rotisserie you should have recipes for it !!! There are hardly any at all... I am very dissappointed in this book... I need to find recipes to use my rotisserie and this isn't one.....
5,Great recipes! Especially for the holidays!,"I so enjoy George Foreman's Big Book of Grilling Barbecue and Rotisserie. Trying to fnd some new reipes for the holidays, I turned to this wonderful cookbook for ideas. It is full of fantastic recipes! I decided to try the pork tenderloin with cranberry glaze on page 62. My entire family loved it! It will surely be on the menu this holiday season. This cookbook is a great way to keep dinner new and exiciting. All of the recipes are simple to follow and the results are mouthwatering!"
3,home cooking,Book was first class- just not for me-not my type of food choices. It is just me at home now and the recipes were not for me- not saying they would not be great- but not for me.
4,I'm loving this rotisserie,"I ordered this and actually received this on the next day without paying any shipping and handling. That was amazing! It came fully protected, no problems.We used it that very night. I had a little difficulty in putting the rotisserie spit back when i placed a chicken on it - but after that it worked well..We also used the skewers for hot dogs and the kids loved it. Tasted like ballpark dogs from a stadium.Cleans well - i use al. foil in the drip pan - and taking the back shield off is sometimes difficult, as well as cleaning the front glass, but all in all it is definitely worth the money."
1,I'm too bored to finish it.,"I almost NEVER fail to finish a book, even when I'm not thrilled with it. But I just can't read another word of Lakota Winds. I've managed to get to page 195, and I give up. The characters are flat and uninteresting. There is no excitement to the story line at all. Whenever a scene comes up that has the potential for being exciting, the author glosses over it with an easy solution. Everything about the story is typical. You can guess what will happen next, and it does. Sappy line after sappy line, you can't help but roll your eyes at the way the author writes the dialogue.The one character who could have been great, the heroine Chumani, is destroyed at the very beginning of the story. She was a warrior woman, but is quickly married to a warrior from another tribe and she spends the rest of the book gathering fire wood and sewing. Blah! I can't take any more."
3,"Realistic and factual, but repetitive.","Sgt. Russ gave a very interesting and realistic account of the static situation we faced during the approximate two years it occurred, but I felt he wandered a lot. While I have every confidence that the events were accurate, they varied little from each other. Perhaps the lack of actual advances and redrawals of any significance made it seem repetitive."
3,Wumpscut - I Want You,"I love this song, seriously, this song is amazing. There's nothing quite like the original version, and these remixes don't really touch upon it's greatness, although the Slut Remix is pretty good. The original version is not on the disc, you'll have to go to the full length album ""Eevil Young Flesh"" for that. This is a nice single for a spectacular song, but more worthwhile content would have been nice."
1,What a joke,"Wumpscut is a fantastic band (singular:Rudy). It is music of the brilliant variety. I don't understand why this single is so readily available. This cd is not but for the HARDCORE Wumpscut fans. Why? Because it really isn't very good. If you're new to Wumpscut look for an album, not this bombshell."
1,Not Worth Buying,"Absolutely loved the 1st book, 'In Fury Born'. So much so that I finally had to order a replacement copy for the original I loaned out and lost.I also ordered 'Path Of The Fury' and Hell Hath No Fury'. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!This book, 'Path Of The Fury', is a RE-PRINT of the second half of 'In Fury Born' and is NOT worth buying.Get the whole story in 'In Fury Born'. It is worth your money.The book, 'Hell Hath No Fury' is NOT related to either 'In Fury Born' or 'Path Of The Fury' ."
4,Not a bad read,"Path of Fury goes through a grab bag off military sci-fi terminology. If you don't wasn't to read about Fasset drives, SLAM Drones, various types of intergalactic warships and why one is superior to another, then this isn't a book for you. Besides the Fury, a mythological being that interfaces with an AI and the main character, there aren't a lot of new twists in the novel. There are a lot of elements similar to David Weber' s other space opera books such as technologically augmented people, military-political intrigue in a space empire, and frustration with dishonest or incompetent military leaders. Overall, an enjoyable read in the military sci-fi genre that has created so many David Weber fans."
3,"A good Story, but why the reprint??","As I was reading In Fury Born, I thought that this is a prototype charicter for Honor Harrington. Honor is more refined, more developed, but there are similarities. That said, I really enjoyed In Fury Born, if Path of the Fury has not been too chopped up, it will be a great read. I have yet to read a David Webber book that I did not like. I have read the complete Honor Harrington series, and all the Honorverse books I could find. I have pre ordered the latest books that have not yet been released. This is more a review of the author than this book, but what the heck I know what I like."
4,"One of Weber's better books, and stands alone.","This is one of David Weber's better space opera science fiction books. Like most of his books, it is heavy on military fleet tactics and ""imperial"" style politics. However, in this case, these themes are subservient to the more interesting story of a female retired space commando who aquires a ancient greek spirit of vengeance -- a ""fury"". Also, unlike most other of Weber's books, it is stand alone. I consider this a great book for someone first time reading Weber."
5,"Science-fantasy! Oh, yeah!","Alicia DeVries is a strong woman to begin with. When she follows her grandfather into the military, she is cybernetically enhanced to near super-human strength and speed. She is disillusioned by a real FUBAR that costs more than ninety percent of her platoon their lives and retires to live with her family on a remote planet. Without giving away the plot, something happens that leaves her more dead than alive; HOWEVER,she survives and works to exact vengeance, assisted by Tisiphone, the last of the Furies. Along the way, they link up with an AI ship. This makes Alicia truly super-human. Without being boringly detailed about the battles, Weber gives enough information to keep adventure fans involved. He also maintains enough of Alicia's humanity and vulnerability to keep her an interesting person and not just an angry killing machine."
3,Quick and clean holiday fun for sf-action fans,"This book is hardly a classic, but it provided one and a half days of quick and clean entertainment during my holidays. The ending is a tad weak but the story's well constructed and tight. I liked the character(s) and would like to read more books with them.As I said: Fun, action-packed and furious."
3,mostly ok,"It was fun reading as a military sci-fi and well written. The only part I had a hard time with was when self aware A.I.'s and evil spirits come into the action against which no mere human has a chance. This I found hard to swallow, but it doesn't ruin the story."
2,Superwoman,I'm glad this wasn't the first Weber SF book I read. I like my SF more reality fiction based. The Honor Harrington series is my style of SF with great character development and a well developed stage to battle on. In this book found a Superwomen and many BEM's To fight against. If your style of SF is Super hero's defeated evil with little chance of losing this may be your book just not just mine.
1,Not Correct,for the ETX90EC or ETX125EC telescopes. You need a T-mount adapter for YOUR camera body and the Meade 07363 #64 T-Adapter(for ETX). Better do your research before purchasing from this site.
1,Wait before you buy,You need two adapters for this to work on your Camera and your telescope. This is the adapter that fits the telescope. You need another one for you camera for it to work.
3,What you need to take pictures with your 35mm SLR camera...,"I know I was really confused on what I would need to do this. But I figured it out so I thought that I would let you all know! First of all you need to get the correct T-ADAPTER for your telescope (For the ETX-60AT & 70AT the #64ST, for the ETX-90 and higher you need the #64) That is part that actually atteches to the telescope. Then you need a T-RING that fits your specific 35mm SLR removeable-lens camera. You should be able to get a T-RING at any camera reseller store, for around [..].The only other thing that Meade suggests is using a cable-operated shutter release cord. You should be able to get this on Amazon, through your camera manufacuar or an autorized camera reseller. I have not yet recieved my #64ST adapatr and T-Ring, I will write a review after i try them out!"
4,"An adapter that does the job, and does it well","There are enough reviews here to let people know you need this AND some sort of adapter for your camera to make this work.The adapter itself is pretty well made. It is a simple metal ring. It has the correct threading on the inside of the ring and the outside. This is not some cheap plastic thing that will snap between your fingers. The price tag seems a bit high for a little metal ring. But it is a very specialized piece of equipment, your almost certainly not going to be using this for anything else.Pros:*Well constructed, not flimsy feeling*Made out of metal, not cheap plastic*Does what is made to doCons:*Expensive for such a small item"
3,Nothing new but well worth the reading,"It's not exactly an introduction into the whole 'reconquista' issue but rather concluding remarks focused on the betrayal of Granada, the last remaining Muslim enclave in the Iberian peninsula.But it's worth the reading for it clearly shows the advantage of Spanish artillery and the disadvantage of Muslim disunity. Read other books on the similar subject first before tackling this one."
4,Excellent Affordable Literature Reference,"One of the more affordable literature encyclopedias on the market, this tome is not 100 percent exhaustive, but it will have all the major authors, literary terms, and critical approaches. I have found it an invaluable reference as a student of English literature, and I reccomend it for any graduate or undergraduate student."
3,Good to a point,"Sadly missing are many important books, one of which is History of the Franks by Gregory of Tours. Don't expect to reply on this book to provide everything you need to know about the history of literature."
3,The Catcher In The Rye,"1. who is the narrator, and what is his name. 2. list 3 things the narrator does. 3. outline the structure of the book. 4. summerize in à thurman's speech on education, and the narrator's insights. 5. give some aspects of the narrator's life. 6. describe some aspect of the narrator's life."
5,amazing underwear!,"I never thought i would spend this much on a pair of underwear, but I saw them at REI when I was preparing for a trip to a hot country where I wouldn't be able to pack 14 pairs of underwear. I tried them out at home first, and they are super comfortable, and manage to stay dry no matter what you're doing. They seem clean when you take them off! But you can wash them and they will dry overnight. I love these underwear!"
4,"great product, but runs large","Everything that the 5 star reviews say is true - this stuff dries super-fast, cleans very easily in cold water (ex. creek), packs great, etc. The only problem I have is that all Ex Officio products run large: at least a full size large. The bikini cut is not as bad as the fuller cut models like the brief (I bought some of those just because of a great price & they come up well past my belly button). This might be nice if you are a size medium & want to be able to say you wear a small or extra small, but if you need an extra small, you are stuck. They don't seem to make children's or youth sizes for small adults."
2,I guess I'm the only person with a BOOTAY,"I'm 5'4"" and 125 pounds and a runner. I have a bootay thatcan compete with any J.Lo on the planet and I'm not talking fat.My hips are 37 inches and the medium fit / but if I moved itdid not fit (ride up). The large fit better - but then theleg openings were too large.Bootay is not a bad thing to have these days!But these underpants certainly don't celebrate that.If you have any REAL junk in your trunk (muscle)then move on...I can see the wash-ability of these, but I'm not traveling.I'm living in them...and real life clothing goes in the washer.Just thought I'd try them. Light weight / but don't matchany of my shiny bras... in appearance...pass."
3,"nice subject, very predictible book","This is an anthology that deals with offering therapy to Latino family members. It's nice, but you can guess everything they discuss. Like all Latino studies books, they spend numerous pages bringing up Latino diversity. Like all books on providing therapy to a minority group, there's discussion about the dynamics between minority client and majority therapist. The standout chapter in this book is one about Latino masculinity, by Dr. Bacigalupe: excellent! This book makes little mention about gay Latinos or those in interracial couples. Like the editors, co-authors often have one Spanish last name and one English one; this makes me think that this was a joint Latino and Anglo project. Yes, therapists, across the races, of Latino clients may want to own this book. Still, you already know what half the book will say without even opening it."
1,BEWARE -- THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!!!!!!,"I bought this CD looking for the song ""I Remember You"" by Sarah Mclachlan. I was excited when I found it on a CD that was filled with good songs, but when I put it in my CD player I was shocked! This is actually one of those CDs where none of the songs are sung by the original artists. Instead some really great songs are butchered by cheap, low budget imitators who can't get their own record deals. Do not be fooled. You will be extremely disappointed. I should have been forwarned when I saw how cheap the CD was and also that the artists names were not listed on the lining. I love Amazon.com and am pleased with their service but I will never make that same mistake again!"
1,READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!!,I wish I had read the other review before buying. Now I've spent $8 on a CD I won't ever listen to again. These songs are not sung by the original artists. Be aware before you buy.
1,It is just a blank notebook,"When I read the only other review on the website, I was misled. I thought this was a short collection of Einsteins notes or comments. It is not. It is simply a blank notebook with a b/w picture of Einstein on the cover and E = mc2 on the back. If that is what you want, then you will be pleased, however, for actual written material by Einstein, check out Ideas and Opinion, it is a great collection of his written work based on Mein Weltbild."
2,About the previous reviews,"Thank you Amy of Chicago, for pointing out that this indeed was a blank notebook. It is a shame that a few pseudointellects tried to make it sound like more. In a world of recession and near poverty incomes it is a shame to mislead people this way. I am sure Professor Einstein would have frowned on the lack of humanity that these few show in trying to appear more intelligent than they apparently are."
4,look smart,I heat boring notebooks. Organizing is easy if you relate the cover to what you are going to put in it. I put stuff I need to think about in this one.
2,Very small....,"This is like the size of a 4x6 card. Really, it is that small. So if you want a pocket sized notebook, fine. Otherwise, do not buy it."
3,Smaller than expected,I expected 8 1/2 x 11 paper but this notebook is very small. Only a couple of inches. The cover and binding is of very good quality.
5,Awesome!,Works great! Get a ton of battery life on it! Definitely worth more than the price! Very satisfied by the purchase.
1,Yours and others misinformation,"I dont know why this notepad is advertised as Einstein Notebook. And author is Einstein ? There is no text. And language is English ? Again there is no text !I bought it via ALBERT CHEMPEREK in Poland thinking it is a book with some notes (biographical ?) written in English by Einstein himself. This guy has not included the information that it is a DECORATIVE NOTEBOOK as it is on your site. It is in brackets very near to the title. He also specified : author Einstein, language English. suggestion is clear, its a book or notebook written by Einstein in English. In such a way I was misinformed in spite of the fact that there was below a sentence saying 64 coloured pages etc. The price was 30 PLN which is about 10 dollars, which is enough to buy a good lunch in a restaurant. Reprimend him please and change your info also."
3,"Good cover (5*), but a shallow read. (2 sec., ave.)","It would have been nice to have one of the Great Man's thoughts as a header on each page. But instead, I have to do my own thinking and fill 100 blank pages!I wonder what he was thinking when they took that picture. 'TV sucks.' 'What was I just thinking?' 'Man, I have milked this image for all that it is worth.' or 'I can't get those dumned Unified Theory equations to simplify. This sucks.' He doesn't look too chipper.I recommend you get this notebook, come up with one good thing that'll help the world, and write it in. Cheer Al up."
4,Bought this to qualify for free super saver shipping,Just a little notebook. Nothing special other than the face of Einstein on it. It is smaller than I thought when I saw it in the picture.
2,really small,"I bought three,all different pictures on them.And I did reviews on all.They are small,no lined pages,and not very many pages."
2,notebook,very small notepad. can't write too much in this little pad but its cute if you need a poicket type notepad!
2,It Bent!,I liked the look of this item and bought it to squeeze oranges and pomegranates. I used it two times -- on the second time the lower part that holds the orange bent. It is still usable but you should use your weak arm to press juice with this. It's not built for a full squeeze.
1,JUNK,Only used this item several times and the gear inside broke. It was designed for easy replacement but you can't get a new one from the company. They only want more money to test it when you finally get a response. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
1,Got Aluminum?,"I own this. The juicing parts are made of aluminum, and it is scary to see how they go from an oxideized grey color to shiny bright when you juice something acidic... and guess what, everything you juice in this machine is acidic! For me and my health, it gets a 1."
1,Looks good but doesn't work,Last night I tried to juice a lime and not a single drop came out! I am finally giving up and admitting this item is worthless for juicing. It does look cute on the countertop though.
1,Thumbs down,"My wife purchased this for me as a gift. It only lasted a few weeks from periodic use. The flat gear on the unit broke off and the unit is not useable any more. It was made in P.R. China, which is a major factor for the poor quality and very short product life. I am now looking for a manual press that is made in the USA."
2,Mighty OJ press,"It worked fine for several presses, but then set-screw comes looseand the top part falls off. Its a pain putting back together.I would not recommend it."
4,Metrokane Manual Citrus Juicer,"This juicer is easy to use and is fully portable, since it is not electric. It is light weight and the lever is easy to pull. Clean up is also easy. The only drawback is that the juice yield is small and you must use 2 or 3 oranges to get a glass of juice."
1,have not received item,"We have not received the item as of today, Saturday December 10, 2011. Can't review something we have not yet received."
2,Don't buy it!,"There are way better books out there for the price. The text contradicts itself numerous times, it is hard to use this book as a self study tool.You have to have an instructor at all times to make corrections and guide you through it. I had it as a student in school, and was constantly refering to different sources. Don't waste your money!"
3,"Good textbook, but double-check info","This is a good textbook if you have other resources available to double-check the information. The main problem I found with this book is that it tends to contradict itself, which can be quite frustrating for a student who is preparing for a test. For instance, the text will tell you that a certain condition usually presents as a single lesion, but the table right next to it says that same condition usually presents as a multiple lesion. This doesn't happen all the time, but it is more often than I would expect for a textbook.Also, if you are an instructor wishing to use the multiple-choice questions from the test-bank, make sure to review the answer key. Sometimes the answer given as correct it just completely wrong."
3,"Good product, but not with all TV's","I believe this is a good product, but the technology is not there so that it works with all TV's. I ordered from an online seller via Amazon and found that I was unable to return the product because the box had been opened. I would call MonsterCable before I purchased because they informed me (after the fact) that this product does not work with my TV. When I say it does not work with my TV, I mean it does not work 100%. I am able to use it as a battery back up, but it will not turn the TV off when the power goes out. So, the product does what I need it to, but the extras are not functional. Hope this helps someone looking to buy this product."
1,Not worth the money,"Review:I've had my HTUPS500 for 2 years, now and I'm fed up with it and will be getting something else. My biggest complaints are:1. It doenst keep my components on very long when the power goes out, (like maybe 3 minutes tops with just my DVR turned on).2. My biggest complaint is that when the power does finally come back on, the HTUPS-500 doesnt automatically turn back on, which means that my DVR doesnt come back on, and I miss TONS of programming, even if the power was only out for 10 minutes. You have to *manually* turn the UPS back on once power is restored.For the money, I would expect more. I wont be buying any more Monster products. They are WAY over-priced for what you get.My recommendation: Buy something else."
4,Wonderful,"Cross dressing confused mad man and a witty gorgeous angry go, go head to head. How could it get better. Oh! He is ripped apart. It's brilliant. Don't mess with an angry Greek God."
5,Bought a can and wolfed 'em down!,"I hadn't tried canned clams or oysters in years because I remeber sort of liking them and also eating sand or shell or something, so I was afraid to try them even though they supposedly are healthy to eat.So, I summoned up the courage to try canned oysters again and bought a can of these, and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a huge oyster fan, but I could see buying these again sometime. So, the guy who doesn't like oysters a lot liked these, and that's saying something."
3,Not too good - I guess OK if you had in emergency room.,Just ordered these and was not impressed. I think I'll stick with going out to a restaurant like Pappadeaux's. I guess I should have expected the taste considering they're in a can.
5,One Of The Best Canned Oysters Around,"Crown Prince Natural Smoked Oysters in pure olive oil are outstanding. They have a wonderful smoked flavor and even though they are in olive oil they have a very light taste to them, almost like they were just packed in spring water. The oysters themselves have a light color and firm texture, rather than the dark mushy type of cheaper brands.These cans are smaller than most canned oysters and they are more expensive but the fact is, they are worth it. The best always costs more.Everything about these oysters is excellent."
5,"Yummy, but your roommate might object to the delicate scent","A great way to get your oyster fix without shucking or shuffling out to a restaurant. But unless you live alone or with fellow oyster-lovers, light a candle before you open can! The oil makes the scent linger. Plenty of dishsoap for the empty can is also a must."
3,Good Theory analysis.,Disappointed because it lacked tutorials. The few examples that were in the book were not too easy to follow
4,Inside ProSurface ??? humm...,"This book is well written but not meant for beginning users of ProE. The creation of surfaces requires the designer to create datum features which more advanced surfaces can be created with. The book dose a poor job discussing the creation of datum features. But if you are a intermediate level user of ProE it will not matter. The book is great for getting some valuable concepts from... However, you will not be able to do surfacing even if you master the concepts in the book because there are no menu picks in the book. The material is presented in a clear manner but the menu picks for some of the more advanced topics are 3-4 layers deep.. ""so good luck finding them""FYI: You will still need the advice of an experienced Surfacing Designer. Just to find the menu picks....There are few surfacing books on the market so I suggest you get what you can.. BUY THE BOOK..."
2,WORTHLESS - except as kindling,If you expect to learn surfacing techniques in Pro-Ewith help from this book - good luck! The examples are weakat best and lack any step by step instruction. Save your money.
3,"A good book of theory and techniques, not tutorials","This book offers a wide range of useful information involving surface creation theory and techniques. However, it does not offer in depth surface creation tutorials."
2,"The sound quality is poor, there is graininess in the bass","Most of the pieces on this collection are good. However, any piece that has loud drums, the sound distorts into a grainy mess. I don't even know how the sound engineer was able to release this CD with such flaws. The bad pieces sound like someone put the bass equalizer on +20db and totally messed up the sound. I know that the problem is on my end because I have good audio equipment, and similar loud drums on other pieces do not have such distortion.Bottom line is that if you are an audiophile of any kind, the bass distortion on many Swan Lake pieces will have you dissatisfied."
2,Poorly written,"I honestly couldn't get far in this book. Apart from anecdotal stories and poorly written suppositions (including a particularly absurd narrative concerning supposed end-time events), it didn't have much to offer that other books addressing the same subject matter haven't done better. If you want something about near death experiences, or life after death, from a christian point of view, check out Immortality: The Other Side Of Death by Gary Habermas and J. P. Moreland. Habermas and Moreland wrote Immortality for a wider audience, but they still manage to offer a more informative, intellectual look at this subject than most books in this genre offer."
3,There are better options,"Be aware that this is an outdated book. It was published more than 30 years ago, so it lacks of any reference on modern theory and approaches to control problems.On its behalf, I have to mention that it has more than 350 solved problems, and includes supplementary exercises on each chapter.I own several books on Control Systems (including this one), but if you have to buy just one and you are in the process of choosing it, I would recommend Katsuhiko Ogata's Modern Control Engineering."
4,Well made and attractive,"I am pleased with the bird travel case. It is very attractive, and very well made. I would change a couple things, however.I would cover the perch snugly with a washable terry cloth sleeve so that the bird, who is often being jostled about during travel, would have a better purchase and therefore feel more secure. I am going to try to make something myself for just that purpose.Also, I wish there were little food and water places that could be securely attached."
3,"Appears to be a good product, except for the perch/holder.","The overall design and materials seem to be good - shape, handle, zipper, lining; however, fabric is not going the correct direction (I can live with that). The perch is only 1/2"" in diameter, which is too small for anything bigger than a cockatiel (photo shows cockatoo). The sides are flexible, so the perch can come out of it's holders if there is any pressure put on the top, and will have to be glued in place.Vo-Toys Pet Voyage Bird Traveler Tropical Print 12 1/4 in x 16 in x 8.5 in"
4,Handy Bird Carrier,"Very sturdy and good quality, well made. Perch is a smaller dowel than expected. But it works fine for my S.I. Eclectus."
4,bird carrier,"I really like this carrier. The only problem I see with it, is that since it is suggested for a medium sized parrot (we have an African Grey) I think the perch inside should be of a thicker diameter. Our bird has a hard time holding on and we ended up taking the perch out to let her sit on the bottom so she didn't hurt her wings.But, it's a nice quality carrier and it looks nice too.I received it quickly and it was packaged well.All in all I'm very happy with it."
1,Piss poor photocopy &#9472; Do not purchase,"I must have purchased worse products in my life, but I can't remember when. Clearly, this book was reproduced when photocopying was in its infancy. Sssome pages were blown up so large they had to be laid in under landscape orientation.The over-sized courier font 18 might have been tolerable had the binder person not put the pages together before the ink was dry. The result was that much of the text smudged, making it unreadable.In other parts of the book the ink within the fonts bled together making the words or letters unintelligible. The ink on most of the fonts did not adhere to the pages evenly, making the text blurry and difficult to read with missing parts of the letters or fade outs. In all cases, this book is a mess and should not be on the market."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I think that this CD SINGLE is one of the worst ones I have heard. Her Leave (Get Out) one wasn't too bad I liked that we got the background music, Baby Its You was ok cool background music track, but Not That kinda Girl Isn't that good. You get the video, the original song, and 3 remixes of it. So not worth your money."
5,This router is handy and powerful,"I love cordless tools; this is the 15th cordless tool that I bought and it is really handy when it comes the time to trim a little edge off or drill a hole for a hinge. I am not a carpenter or any expert when it comes to woodworking, but I believe there is a purpose for each tool, and this router, after owning for just 1 week, helped me installed a pet door out of the wall on the sunroom. It chewed up the plywood fast and easy, saved me from chiseling. Good tool! Wish I had it when I installed my new door lock..."
3,I liked it till...,I liked the flat head and the length... it was exactly what I wanted... THEN...The third prong - the ground portion - broke off.
5,Great Straight-Forward Surge Protector,"The swiveling flat head plug and eight-foot cord on this surge protector are great for ""bringing out an outlet"" from behind furniture. I've owned three of these for several months and they all perform as designed."
1,DO NOT WORK,Still getting power surge that shut down my system.Spent $$$ to get the system check and tech says hardware FINE.Waste of $$$
1,Junk,Broken in 2 weeks of use.No return offered.Wasted money.DO NOT BUY.I guess I had it sitting for too long before I actually used it.
1,What a pain!,"It took me weeks to find a power strip that worked for my needs. Belkin strips are sold everywhere. Sadly when they created this 360 plug, they neglected to look at how it would affect adjacent plugs/transformers. The 360 plug is wider than a standard plug, thus my problem. The way some of their power strips are boxed. You can not tell if it has 360 plug or not. I also needed the outlets to be facing left or right not straight up and down."
4,Very practical,Very handy. Works great for spots with limited space like behind a bed or nightstand. Especially if you need to swivel the flat plug in a particular direction.
1,Don't Buy... It will fail.,"Like other reviewers, the plug melted on both of the strips that I purchased. It worked fine with very small appliances but when I plugged in a small heater, it melted the connector. I'm surprised that the surge protector did not trip. The swivel/flat plug is a great idea but this surge protector is a safety hazard."
5,Works great!,"These outlets are extremely helpful when putting furniture flat against a wall, the outlet allows the furniture to be flush while still making the electrical outlets available!Works great and can't seem to own enough of these!"
5,Perfect for what I needed,"I needed a flat plug in extension cord to be able to use a plug in that is next to my bed frame. This product was perfect! The plug is thin, perfect size. Plenty of additional extension plug ins with 3 prongs. PERFECT!"
5,What a great idea.,"This is awsome and fits flat so its perfect in a childs bedroom. She can not pull it out of the socket. It works great, even better than the safety plugs."
1,DO NOT BUY! FIRE HAZARD!,I will let my pictures do the talking. The Belkin surge protector was plugged directly to the wall outlet. I bought it for the flat plug and was left in the same position since day 1. I do not think over-rotation is the issue. I will also contact Belkin as this is a safety concern.
2,"looks nice, fire hazard","I liked this item until it shorted out and made burn marks on the wall socket.. too late to return it at this point... it looks great, is a good idea but apparently the manufacturing isn't that good... I'm an Electrical Engineer, I can diagnose what went bad, there was no overload, something went bad in the rotating portion..."
1,Junk-don't bother,"Should have seen it for the gimmick it is. We bought several of these when we moved into our home two years ago because there are very few outlets, and they're all in weird spots. One by one these have been crapping out. If you monkey with the cord near the plug you can some times get them to work, but the swivel function apparently tears up the inner connections. The ones we've never had to move or re purpose seem fine, but any of them that we've swapped from one spot to another are now landfill bound."
3,"Good and does what it should, but HOLY CORD!","This is a great product and does what it's suppose to. I love the three prong setup that is moveable for whatever you need it for. I do NOT care for the fact that the cord on this thing is HUGE. I took for granted the picture was representative and it is definitely NOT. While some say this is a good thing, what I'm using it for it would have been better to have a cord similar in length to the picture. Just be careful of the dimensions in the end."
4,"Mmm, the rotating plug","I bought this for one reason, the flat rotating plug. I have a drawer against my wall which is blocking the plug, so the only way to utilize it was to get a flat plug. This plug rotates as advertised, but would have liked it more if it provided a feature where unused plugs would have a cover on it."
1,Don't Buy Belkin with rotating plug,"I saw some of the reviews discussing the melted Belkin 'rotating low profile plug', and figured it was a 1 in a million shot, so went ahead and bought one anyway. Mistake. I would not recommend buying any Belkin product with this rotating plug. Way too many people complaining about what must be a major safety issue. Plugs should not short out - period. I've never in my 50+ years, had a plug short out and melt the plastic - pretty poor."
1,Dud,It didn't work at all. I was very disappointed. This is the first time I have bought a Belkin surge protector that was a lemon.
5,I Love This Book,"This book proves that non-fiction is the new fiction! I'm bored with novels, etc.. Books like this are way more engaging. I love the author's style. His writing is as good as it gets. He takes us on a road trip through the Great Plains and focuses in on whatever presents itself. Also this road trip is not bound by time. We go forward and back freely. This is one of those book I didn't want to end."
3,"Nice, but a little thin","I picked up this book because I have been in love with the Great Plains ever since a cross-country drive took me through North Dakota. Ian Frazier's writing is certainly beautiful, full of evocative ellipses, but I was disappointed to see that he focused on the human history of the region, which to me is just sordid and ugly, and not on the natural history which is what I really wanted to know about. The bits about his present-day experiences are too fragmented and could use a little more substance to stick them together. Nice style, pretty good atmosphere, but not enough facts (for me anyway)."
3,Something is wrong,"Everything works fine, but when my hair was a few inches long I was having a huge issue with the clipper getting caught in my hair and tugging it. It was really painful. It works fine for close cuts..it gives you a great quality cut, but I would never use this for hair that's over two inches unless I'm asking for a death wish."
1,Good clippers bad adjusting handle,The clippers are professional as it gets. Very sleek and has a high power motor to mow down the toughest hair. BEWARE! The adjusting handle on the clippers may be loose fresh out the box. There's no way to tighten it so for me I pretty much wasted money. But if you can look over not being able to keep it adjusted they're great clippers with a guide on it.
2,Not what I ordered.,"My husband is very happy with them. The reason for the 2 stars? I did not receive the Improved masters that I ordered. I received the original masters. Im very unhappy, but he doesnt want to go through the trouble of sending it back, so we are keeping them."
1,Rip off,I spent well over 100 all together for the clippers and the guards.thought i had i great product until they broke after like the tenth use.Now they dont even cut and make a huge niose. Even tried adjusting them.*** Dont Buy****
5,Good Clippers,"I like these clippers a lot. They are very accurate and fast plusfast delivery from amazon(2 days).I am saving money now that I cut my own hair(I'll still go to thesalon on special occasions for good fades).The only thing thatworried me on getting these clippers were the reviews sayingthat they get hot.As for me, they haven't got hot on me(I usethem between 10 and 25 minutes).I was planning on getting upscalecordless panasonics but I found that these andis looked well madeand not very expensive.Everyone I showed these to were impressed(as for me also).I'm proud that these are American made and made awesome.I hopethese last forever(thats what we all want, things that are well madeand last forever)."
5,Great Clipper,Great clipper don't listen to those other bad reviews. I would write a review but I'm too lazy right now. Instead go to YouTube and type in andis masters review xmunoztv47 and my review will pop up.
3,easy fades,"this item is does not come with the guards. you have to spend another 10 - 15 bucks before you can start cutting hair. also if you cut your own hair, these clippers are NOT light weight. other than that, its awesome for doing fades."
2,No return policy,"I recently bought these clippers but before I got to use them they did not come with attachments as suggested in the details of the clippers. I wanted to return them because I no longer wanted them. They told me; ""Hi. How are you? As you know I have no control over the pricing of the manufacturer. You can contact the manufacturer and tell them but I doubt that they will add anything to the packaging since this item has been selling like this for many years. There are many accessories that you can purchase separately. Thank you""They are suggesting that I go back to the supplier and try to get the attachments. How about you don't advertise they will come with the clippers. How about I don't care, I just want to return the product. Make sure if you buy clippers they are not from ""Always Bargin."" Poor customer service."
4,Metal body get extremely hot to the touch.,If you are a barber and have multipule customers at one time.... then these clippers are not for you. The body gets very hot. I contacted Andis and they do not make a cover for the clipper to protect your hand and the customer. (Like the Wahl clipper covers). I do not use these clippers anymore.They do cut beautifully though...
2,Pass on these,"These clippers don't cut evenly, over heat right away, not recommended if using for bald fades. I regret buying these you still have the chance to pass."
4,Very Nice Product,"I have own many clipper over the pass 25 years. These are the best for fades hands down, they have blade ajustment on side of clipper that don't move as your cutting that fade!As for baldheads Oscars are the best on the market with #ooooo blade.. I plan a getting T-Trimmers they seem to be a good product as well.."
5,A must have in your clipper stable...,"Strong clippers that you will find yourself going to constantly. Great for fading, and fast at creating your blend. Also, a great shape for your hands (Wahl Senior's feel odd in your hands)They can get warm, but have never ran that hot on me. Would have loved if they came with clips, but the clips for this clipper are not expensive. If the best barber use the Master's as there go to clipper, that kinda speaks for itself. This is a win if you get these."
5,GREAT CLIPPER,Great clippers from Andis. Give you that professional finish look. That's what I was looking for and price better than SALLY.
4,"Great, but not Awesome","I have cut my hair four times with these clippers. They are pretty solid clippers, but I guess I was expecting more for what I paid, as well as the brand name. The ones I had before were half the price and cut just as well. They were also from Andis. I love this brand. They do make amazing products. Adjusting them has not been an issue. I have also cut my son's hair as well. They do have a good weight to them, but nothing I can't handle for a lengthy time. I also have not experienced any heat issues with them. Overall, they are solid clippers so far."
1,Broke In Less Than A Week,"Less than a week after I bought this ""wonderful"" clipper, it already stopped working. Pathetic. But if you like shiny things that look nice but don't work, go right on the hell and buy this piece of junk. Built Ford soft. smh."
1,Not Good,"I don't know if the clippers are actually bad, but from where I purchased (hairproducts.com) the product was garbage. It makes more noise than a tractor and is very very heavy. For self users I would not recommend this."
5,LOVE IT!,"Wow, this clipper is excellent and a must-have for all barbers. It came faster than expected! Ignore all the bad comments. Adjusting is very simple because all you have to do is follow directions! Love ittttt. It doesn't come with guards so you can purchase them at your local sallys for 18 bucks."
2,master machine,"I thought that the Andis master was cool and quiet. Usually, when i cut hair it really starts to make lots of noise. And after a while of cutting hair it starts to get really hot and burn my fingers."
2,no good!!!!!!,"When I first got this machine, I loved it. However after 2 months it started to make a really loud buzzing sound, right after that it didn't want to cut through my thick hair not even my sons thin hair!!!! What gives??? Really dissapointed in this product!!!! The only andis machine I'm buying is the t outliner. But for now I'm goin back to my wahl clippers I've had for 5 years now and still goin strong!!!"
5,classics,"it is joe cocker, you already know what he sounds like. the title is ""classics"", and they are. a good way to have a lot of joe cocker sound in one place."
1,Not so solid for a classics collection of his hit songs!,Hey i'll have to disapoint you by saying this though. Don't bother with any CD of Joe Cocker's albums because for me i'd rather prefer a casual listener to get his Anthology [BOX SET]. You'll be surprise in what the results could be satisfied for sure instead!
1,"Not universal, doesn't fit, doesn't come with adapter","Despite the instructions having an illustration of product being fastened into place, there is no hole in the base, and the arm came with no nut or adapter.Arm does not fit my car.Even if this so called ""universal"" arm fit my car, the arm isn't capable of ""locking"" back for changing blades like every other wiper arm I've ever seen on a vehicle.Going to try to return this awful product and just JB weld my old stripped wiper arm onto the old car."
2,I was whelmed,"I have been overwhelmed by music, and I have been underwhelmed by it as well....but this album is...just...whelming. It's boring and 'uninspired.' I took it to the used CD shop less than a week after I bought it and traded it in for some old Jim Croce stuff. I wouldn't reccomend a purchase of the CD. And as for the first reviewers love of the bass playing? Sounds like the bass player is trying to promote his own work under an anonymous review...honestly...pathetic. The bass on this album is lackluster and...just average. Not impressed...save your money."
2,Mediocre at best,"I couldn't disagree more with the previous review. The music is dull, uninspired and somehow, predictable. I was sorry that I spent any money on this album, and will avoid the bassists work in the future...yawn. Needs some lessons."
1,You get what you pay for!,"This laser worked well when I first got it. Now its been a year and the warranty has expired. The unit has problems with the self-leveling. It won't self-level, something internally is worn out. You can hear it grinding. I have about 50 hrs of use on it. Don't waste your money on this junk like I did. Spend a little more and get a Spectra with a two year warranty. Unfortunately for me, this unit will cost more to fix than to replace it. I hope this is helpful to you in making your purchase decision."
1,Even one star is too much! Yuck!,"Almost all of Ms. Lindsey's work is wonderful, but this one really sucks! I don't know what in the world Ms. Lindsey thought she was doing when she wrote this story. I could never fall for an SOB like Jared Burkett, and I don't know why Corinne was masochistic enough to still want him even after he had humilated and used her. The whole story was ""choppy""--lacking tender touching moments wherein they could bond or believably start anew. I don't even know how they even had any kind of relationship when they were both too intent on revenging themselves upon one another."
5,Finally...a guide that really works,"This book has been a reference for me for many, many years. I hope a second edition is printed because I've about worn mine out. In the interest of full disclosure, I know the author, Andrea VanSteenhouse, and have collaborated with her on many projects over the years. I've always enjoyed her kindness, her wit, her wisdom and her sense of humor."
4,Groucho doin his job right,"Volume 2 is a very good DVD to have around the house. It includes 4 episodes just like the first one, but it isn't as funny as volume 1. But for the way it sells at that price, buy it and you wont be mad."
2,disappointed,"I just opened the box and was very disappointed. The door panel grooves have spots that don't have paint on them. The drawer bottoms are cardboard and the sides have a very thin laminent, similar to contact paper, but harder. The corner of one drawer is ripped. I tried to get help on line to make a complaint but didn't find a place to make one. I moved things out of kitchen to make room for the buffet and now my house is in disarray. I hope Target and I can come to a remedy."
1,White Kuffet,"This isn't made very strong, as I have a collection of bowling balls in the kitchen, when I stored them in this shelf, a few days later, the whole wood just imploded. There were visible cracks and it was un-salvageable. So if you are going to use this for heavy steel rim pancake racks or thick glass pans, it won't be of much use. Should be fine if you store fine linen napkins or kerchiefs."
3,Sturdy pair of folding glasses with a flaw,"Overall, the reading glasses have a sturdy feel and store compactly. The only problem i have noticed is that the glasses are designed so that the fold in one of the temples leaves a slight mar on the inside of the left lens."
4,Excellent!!!,"I liked this book very much, it transported me to a time in my country that i didn't know anything. Julia made a great job showing me how was Salome's life not as a poet, as a woman..."
2,Spare me!,"Ugh - one of the worst books I've ever read! It was difficult to even finish. Camila idolizes her dead mother that she barely remembers from her toddler years. So redundant - boring storyline. Disappointing after reading ""How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents"", which was superb."
5,Brilliantly Crafted Historic Novel,"Alvarez does not disappoint with ""In the Name of Salome."" A brilliantly spun tale, well researched and artistically crafted, about Dominican poet Salome Urena de Henriquez and the daughter who was born just three years before Salome's death. Politics, love, intrigue, betrayal, and the gamut of human emotion are woven intricately within the pages, in alternating chapters from mother to daughter. While the novel comes together beautifully at the end, the backwards chronology of Camila's story can be a little confusing through the first 2/3 of the novel. It is with purpose though, and masterfully done. Novel spans 1856-1973."
3,Not compatable with my phone,I think this product will work as long as you have the 2.5 mm jack but I have the usb jack and had to buy the right one at the T-Mobil store but for what I paid for this one it's o.k.
1,Glitch calls at random and interferes with conversations,"I was initially excited to see the low price, but a couple days after using this earpiece, I started noticing a tone in my ear during conversations. The tone cut me off from the person I was talking to. I would also be driving with the earpiece in and notice my phone start calling the last number dialed. It happens quite frequently. The sound is fine and people seem to be able to hear me clearly when it's not glitching, but the glitch pretty much renders it useless."
3,IF YOU HAVE BIG EARS!!!,"THE EAR BUD IS TOO BIG FOR MY EARS. THE FOAM BUD PROTECTOR DIDN'T LAST TWO MINUTES, THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR IT. IF YOU DON'T MIND STUFFING THESE INTO YOU EAR, THEY DO WORK."
4,Adorable!,"These nylon knee-highs are adorable. They stay up fairly well and look great with any skin tone. Very cute for sexy Halloween costumes, which is why I bought them. Good price, too!"
4,Perfect!,"These are exactly what I expected, and a perfect fit. Didn't fall down once! Can't really go wrong with knee highs!"
4,Perfect title for perfect lounge music,"If you heard Carmen Rizzo for the first time and thought, ""Wow, that reminds me of Conjure One"" you're not the only one and you're not far off. He was the engineer on the Conjure One debut album and there are definitely similarities - the female voices over the same kind of chilled beats.I wouldn't, however say the album is on par with Delerium (""Karma"" or ""Poem""), simply because the lyrics aren't as subtle or mysterious as Delerium and the voices on this album other than Kate Havnevik (Jem, Esthero...) hardly count as ethereal - I find they tend to dominate the music rather than blend and float on top of it.Overall, the album is a good listen for those Sunday evenings at home."
5,great individual album,The idea for this album came from the large outdoor sculptures created by Alexander Calder. My goal was to write sound compositions which would present a stationary focus in the home listening environment. Each track offers an individual mood while still conforming to the overall theme of stability. ~ Stewart Walker
4,so far so good,"I haven't had the chance to install this item, but it looks good and will do the trick when it is installed.!"
5,Spoken Arabic: The Sacred and Profane,"This is a very intelligent book about a topic that has been plaguing Arabic philoloigists and thinkers. How do you modernize a language that is considered sacred? Is there a difference between the modern Classic Arabic and the Quran's Classic Arabic? What are people's attitudes towards Classical Arabic? Perhaps one of the best passages in this study is when an Egyptian would explain the ease and the relaxed state of mind he is in upon hearing or reading the Quran (which is written in Classical Arabic), yet at the same time would describe the same language as ""diffcult"", and a burdan to write and communicate in within other spheres. Other topics explore the efforts made to transfer a sacred language into print and media and how it defines social heirarchies within Egyptian society."
5,CHIT CHAT ABOUT FLUTE TALK!,"Oh what can be said about this periodical, but I can talk about Flute Talk all day long! When I'm not playing my wood wind, or streaming some Native American Flute albums, I'm reading this magazine. Very informative, fun, and helpful! My E-Flat key was broken, and this held my hand as I stepped up the stairs that was fixing my flute! I give this FIVE STARS! A good gift for any aspiring blowers!"
4,truely smooth,"The cool song ""Red Night ""first got my attention on this CD. It just has that haunting melody that I look for in the ""space jazz"" or acid jazz realm. Some songs are immediately catchy, and others may take a few times to catch on. But they are all just kind of fun, catchy tunes that have a bit of a dance beat to them. Some may say that it borders on hip hop pop. Still it's a fresh, clean sound that these two guys keep coming up with. I understand that this is very popular music on the fashion world runways and that this might scare true fusion jazz folks, but give it a listen, and I think it will fill a jazz void some where in your collection. I heard that the two guys who write for this group also write for Dancing Fantasy,who is also a great space jazz group."
4,I Like,This book is recommended for any first grade teacher but could be used at any grade level. It is designed to inform students that being book smart isn't everything.
1,POOR SELLER,Product arrived damaged and seller gave me a hard time about returning it. I'm stuck with a damaged sleeve.
1,Faulty Product,"As described by many others, this unit is faulty and began turning itself on and off after a few months. My situation is different in that it took a little longer for the problem to materialize so I still had a tv that functioned 95% of the time while waiting the 2 weeks for the A board to arrive. Thanks to other people writing reviews I knew my tv would only get worse so I scheduled the repair as soon as I started experiencing only a slight problem. The sony contracted repair I used was actually very professional and reliable, the tv has been working flawlessly for a month now and I am hoping that will be it. The picture is great but I will be living in fear that it dies again outside the 1 yr warranty period. Avoid this unit."
5,Sony HDTV a constant pleasure,"Had this one from November 2006,and it's been a pleasure ever since. HD broadcasts and my HD DVD and Blu-ray players (Toshiba and Sony) look beautiful. The posters above must have just got TV's from a bad lot. Mine is flawless up until today"
4,Great book for preperation,"When I initially was told I would have to take a Mechanical Aptitude Test for a new job, I was anxious because I really had no idea what to expect on such a test. I chose to order this book and am very satisfied with my choice. Sure, many of the things within this book are not complex at all, but a lot of it you just don't think about on a regular basis. So when it shows up on a test you're caught completely off guard epically if you're not sure what to expect in the first place. This book shows you most of what you can expect on such tests and actually does a great job preparing you for it. It's an easy read and the problems and practice tests are well explained and differ in complexity to prepare you for all different types of questions. Overall, I think this is a great book to help anybody prepare for such a test."
1,Not very useful or complete,"Tried this book out but not very helpful, I needed the spatial and mechanical sections. I think the Arco books are more complete. I needed this book as a study aide for City Lineman exam but it didn't help."
3,flimsy but effective,"I bought two of these fixtures to replace old broken ballast fixtures in my kitchen. They work fine, the ballast is silent, and they light up my fluorescent tubes just fine. Beautiful.Please be aware that this fixture is not designed to hang freely or look pretty. It should go above a kitchen diffusing lens, and not in a garage or shop. The metal is flimsy and you'll probably have to bend parts of it back into place during installation. The tube terminals wiggle a little bit and I think in an earthquake the lights may become loose or lose contact. You have to provide your own electrical cord to hook up to the ballast.I was lucky in my kitchen, I was replacing two similar fixtures, so I just salvaged the cord from those and put them up in no time. If you're looking for cheap working light, buy this. If you're looking for easy installation and an all inclusive kit, this is not for you. 5 stars for the good ballast (and the fact that it ""works""), minus two for the construction."
5,Great movie,"Interesting technology use in the film and the dynamic between the Germans, Soviets and Japanese makes this a particularly valuable film historically."
3,FRITZ LANG'S EPIC THRILLER LOOKS GREAT,"Fritz Lang's great looking 1928 SPIES (Kino) has been restored from various 35mm elements discovered in mostly European archives. At 143 minutes, this version is more than 50 minutes longer than any previous home video release. Lang's action-filled, super-spy thriller stars Rudolf Kleine-Ragge as Haghi, the head of a complex criminal empire. Willy Fritsch is the undercover agent assigned to topple the crime lord from his throne. The plot is greatly enhanced by focusing on two individuals who fall in love while spying on each other.Loaded with sexual intrigue and high-tech gadgets, ""Spies"" remains surprisingly contemporary, even 76 years after its premier. Once again, composer-performer Donald Sosin delivers an intuitively brilliant score that rises organically from Lang's artfully melodramatic scenes. For fans of Lang's ""Metropolis,"" this terrific film is a must."
3,The original SPECTRE,"Thea von Harbou who wrote the script of the film was a NSDAP sympathizer,who actually worked for Hitler's film industry, and served time ina British prison after World War II.This explains why the film is pervaded by basic elements of National-Socialist propaganda: An international Bankers conspiracy,a Lenin lookalike criminal mastermind (complete with the wheelchair andthe blanket of Lenin's fading years), a stateless, multilingual Organization run by underlings in the leather jackets of Soviet People's Commissars etc.Notwithstanding this analysis, this is a very enjoyable spy yarn,which unfortunately-even in this outstanding Kino edition-is incomplete.This is obvious from the photo gallery in the DVD's special features:There are movie stills from parts of the film that are missing.At its best sequences, the film shines on the level of the Dr.Mabuse:The Gamblerand the Testament of Dr.Mabuse. Overall, however, its not on par with those."
3,For some particular purpose only,"I do think this book is a very well-compiled encyclopedia. But this is never interesting for general people even though he is an enthusiast of mythology or folklore because each entry is too concise. Some people who are, for example, a researcher of mythology would find it a useful source of information.I recommend other books such as gEncyclopedia of Ancient Deitiesh for just mythology fans."
3,"This was a ""B-Grade"" album.","I am a huge fan of Brad Roberts voice and his earthy style of communicating through his songs. I am really sorry to say, but this album left me feeling like ""What the hell was that?"". It gave me an impression that ""Puss N Boots"" was quickly composed strictly for commercial reasons. Something happened to Brad's deep baritone voice. I hope that his voice did not change forever and this is only temporary inconvenience.Get well soon, Brad!"
5,Excellent history,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of US Army Rangers. Altieri was a member of the original Ranger unit and participated in formulating, training, and testing the tactics in the British Isles early in WWII. He speaks highly of the first commander, William O. Darby. This is excellent military history. Altieri brings to life the heart, soul, and essence of what it means to be a US Army Ranger. Paul J Kratz, (Ranger 1963-1987)."
5,great book,"This is a really great book. James Alteri, the author, was a ranger in World War II. He gives a really great first person account. That is exactly the kind of book I like. I think that you will like this little story of mine. I read the book in 1969. I was a brand new lieutenant in the US Army. I had just finished airborne school and thought that I was pretty hot as a new airborne soldier (parachutist). I was waiting to go to ranger school and read Spearheaders. It scarred the hell out of me, but it also solidified my resolve. I wish that the book were readily available so that young soldiers could read it like I did. One last twist. At the end of the book, Alteri describes visiting the ranger school that I was about to attend. He was treated as something of a hero because he was one of the guys from the war. I hope to one day visit Fort Benning and the ranger school and be one of the old guys (I will not be a hero like Alteri really was). You cannot help but like this book!"
5,"""folksy"" first person account","Very readable first person account written in ordinary language. I always prefer first person stories of this type. It is like setting down with a favorite unckle on the back porch on a summer evening while drinking lemonaid. Then he tells you in a "" folksy "" way what really happened. Can't put it down."
1,"Couldn't stay the entire album, had to give up on this one!","Can miss album of the year.Lington's best album was Vivid by far and Michael failed to rise to the occasion this time. Dave Koz is the executive producer and should stick to playing the sax and not producing artists.IF YOU CAN STAY WITH LINGTON ON THIS ONEGOOD LUCK.New Album I'd reccomend: Kim Waters, Pieces of a Dream"
5,Not Just Bobby Caldwell's Sax Man Anymore!!!!!,My first experience with Michael Lington was when I saw him as a musician in Bobby Caldwell's band. He was great then and like fine wine gets better with age. I have all four of his CDs and this is his absolute best! I just can't stop playing it. Every song is so great that I can't make up my mind which one is my favorite. If you enjoy listening to the sax you will love this release.

5,Catholic history in an interesting format,"This is a wonderful book! It is the history of Catholism arranged by grouping the main ""movers and shakers"" who have influenced the character and events of the church down through the ages. It is very interesting reading; an overview, certainly, but with witty comentary and a really excellent bibliography for further study at the end of each chapter. It is worth having for the information on ""where to find more information"" alone! I recommend it highly for the neophyte or the scholar."
3,Too small to store the headphones.,Great case but I wanted to travel with the DVD player & the headphones in the same case. The headphones didn't fit so I bought another case. This would be great to put on the back of a car seat.
4,"Fantastic, but in need of an upgrade","Just about every great number the Brass ever did is on this CD, and noone ever did instrumentals better or came up with more innovative arrangements than Herb Alpert, who surely is a genius. For example, Love Potion No. 9 sounds nothing at all like the original, the beat and rhythm are totally rewritten, but the result is a fresh masterpiece. Same with A Taste of Honey and so on down the line, there is not a weak song or even a weak bar here, and even the group's pop hits such as Tijuana Taxi don't seem too corny. The one big drawback here is the sound, it is a bit hissy and muddled, and surely with all the remastering that has been done the past several years someone should see fit to do the same for this outstanding music. Let's hope so."
5,Great Disc,"this is a Great Collection By Herb Alpert& The Tijuana Brass.this Disc contains all of their Best songs such as Whipped Cream,Love Potion#9 and A Great Slow-Jam in This Guy's in Love with you.this is a Must."
3,Pretty but not a good reference book,"This book is an extensive collection of nice pictures of over 350 different succulents. They are arranged in scientific name order. However the descriptions for each entry are just text describing the plant. There is not even basic information like the hardiness zone so you will know if the one you like will survive your winter. The text does not directly reference the picture location so you have to find the picture key somewhere on each page (""This page, left to right ...""). The index is really just a table of contents - common names are listed under the scientific name instead of having a separate entry (""Purple Emperor"" is indexed as ""Sedum, Purple Emperor""). Get this for the pictures then get The American Horticultural Society ""A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants"" for the reference data."
5,Just Beautiful and Full of Soul,"I have heard Ellen perform from New York to Los Angeles -- and her voice (and personality) is absolutely amazing. This CD brings together so many different sounds and evokes so many feelings -- it is perfect for jazz, blues and ""soul"" lovers. The first time I heard ""Love Won't Let Us Wait"" was when Ellen sang it at my wedding reception, and I just loved it. After listening to the full CD, I purchased copies for all of my best girlfriends! I highly recommend this CD, as a gift or for yourself."
5,Ed Doris,"Why don't you hear great music like this on the radio? I know payola is a big thing in the radio world, but I hope some DJ out there will have the foresight to play this cd. If they play it, people will listen and listen and listen.Ellen's collaboration with this talented group of musicians and songwriters is special. I especially enjoyed the songs by Ellen, Noel Cohen & Jenny Bruce. Ellen's a mesmerizing live performer and she somehow transferred her passion and powerful persona to this great cd. Buy it and enjoy it!"
1,Ug Partially hydrongenated oil,With partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in it while not call it Kraft heart disease caramels. There is no excuse for this anymore.
2,Buyer beware--it's unusable,"It came with no instructions. The suction cups are not designed for the product. They are the type that go into a hole and the unit has no holes. It does have four pins, but then they would require the hole to be in the suction cup. There is no way to attach this thing to the side of the tank."
4,Gold Timex Bracelet Watch #T23161,"Watch is exactly what I wanted visually. It is beautiful and fits in a work and play environment. Fits a small wrist with links taken out. I only wish that the band was a little more heavier for the price. I expected solid links that definitely have weight, but have found they are hollow. Other than that minor detail it is a beautiful watch that I can wear to work and business functions."
2,Timex women's watch #T23161,I liked the look of the watch but adjusting the watch band was difficult and so I returned it without using it. I have used Fossil watches in the past and they are far superior in the functionality of watch band adjustment.
1,poor sizing,This is a really made product. BUT the size isn't even close. They were at least 3 or 4 inches smaller than true sizing.
1,TRIBUTE? More like Disgrace,"O.K., This is one of the most horrible disc I have ever heard. I bought it, and the next day I sold it to a used CD place. I thought it would be cool with some of the 80's line-ups that was included, but boy was I wrong. I dont think it would be as bad if it didnt have the vocals."
2,Not to hot for remixes,"Let me start of by saying I love VH, techno music, and remixes of songs. However this Cd is soo butchered its like a crappy DJ made this for his first ever remix set. The techno over powers the lyrics in more than one song. There are only a few songs that have the entire lyrics in them , otherwise they are just poor cuts and loops. If you were to seperate the techno and the covers you would have two good seperate cd's.Dont get me wrong I liked the versions of ""Runnin w/ the devil""and ""Unchained"" not much more than that though. Maybe next tribute will be a little better, lets hope."
3,Not to be taken seriously ..,"If you're looking for ""pure"" Van Halen, this CD isn't it. Instead, you have stumbled across a wide range of diverse artists singing Van Halen tunes, each with his/her own style. Interesting at best, it's not VH like you've ever heard, unless you're fortunate enough to own ""Everybody Wants Some!"" by Cherrydisc Records. The best way to describe this CD is to say it this way: You'll recognize the lyrics, and you can dance to this, if you'd like."
1,Not very good at all,"Despite reading the other reviews and listening to some of the songs on Napster--I would suggest that you download some songs to preview as well--I decided to go ahead and purchase the CD. It truly is not very good at all. I do not understand why metal bands decided to do electronic versions of Van Halen songs or why Bruce Kulick produced it. Nevertheless, I felt that it belonged with my VH collection."
1,Dont Touch It!,"Sorry folks, this one is terrible! I was hopeful after getting Alice Cooper and Aerosmith tributes, but it is nearly impossible to recognize these songs as Van Halen tunes. Stay away!"
4,Still Listening After 30 Years,"I bought this on vinyl in the 1970s and recently on CD. A magic musical session. All musicians at the top of their game. Plus, I love the lineup: guitar, organ, vibes, drums. Great. My only regret is that there weren't any more cuts from this session in the can. Sigh!Scott K Fish"
5,A Trip Around The World For The Price Of A CD,"Duration: 55:02Released on: 1993Traditional international musical styles with Dancing Fantasy's groove-laced soundThe Dancing Fantasy team of Curtis McLaw and Chris Williams take us around the world in sixty minutes with their latest collaboration Worldwide. While their purpose was to reflect the flow of music around the world, this recording does not contain authentic folk music or so-called ""world music,"" but rather their interpretation of the spirit and energy of the various countries, their cultures and people. Incorporating ethnic sound samples, Dancing Fantasy delivers an exciting, stylistic hybrid that intuitively combines traditional musical styles with their own groove-laced, fresh and energetic sound...This successful albums from Dancing Fantasy reached position 15 on the Billboard Top New Age Albums Chart of 1993."
4,No Pan for Boom Pan,"It's the kind of music everyone needs to perk up their day. If you have had a bad day or are expecting a bad day, Boom Pam's music will brighten your outlook.The genre is difficult to identify, but there should be more of it available. Oh yeah, you have to love tubas. Yes, love tubas. Non-tuba lovers need not be afraid. Listen to the CD once and you will be converted.Boom Pan is fresh, unique, familiar, progressive, and retro. simultaneously."
2,Oops!...,"Mind, I take no pleasure in assigning a low rating to a book whose author appears to have been commendably avid, ambitious and well-intentioned; but--given the many, many competing titles that are far more comprehensive and altogether superior, I can't bring myself to recommend this book very highly.To, er, illustrate how this first edition intermittently seems not-quite-ready-for-prime-time, I noticed that the respective miniature, black-and-white drawings of Berlioz and Liszt are transposed. (The picture of Liszt introduces the Berlioz section, whereas the picture of Berlioz--laughably--introduces the Liszt section!) Considering that the author evidently didn't have the wherewithal to forestall such a glaringly embarrassing boo-boo BEFORE his beloved book went to press, how can the reader wholly trust, and comfortably digest, the remainder of this volume's innards? :-)"
2,A disappointment,"The plot line of this novel had great promise but a number of conflicts were either not developed or simply ignored. The story begins with elements of mystery in the true ownership of this property; that is never really resolved. What might have been a humorous tale with some learning on the part of the main characters descended into a formula boy meets girl, boy and girl hate each other, boy and girl fall in love without much reason for any of their behaviors."
4,A sweet story,"I won't repeat the story, for it has already been mentioned below. But I found this was a sweet and romantic love story. Everything was very subtle and gently displayed, from the serene of the country side to the kindness of the hero and heroin's hearts. The only criticism is that I found the heroin was a bit too naive and stubborn--I mean, I could understand the reason behind it, but it has dragged a bit too long for her to look sensible. I do recommend it as a light and fun reading."
2,haven't bought the game but...,"I think they messed up with the product description. I read the nice paragraph about the game being something you can play at parties, or in the car and then the description below says that you have to save sinners and make it into the 9th circle of hell and defeat lucifer... are they just trying to see if anyone's paying attention?"
3,"Where is Clinton, Missouri?","I have not read this book but I was told about it by someone on my Clinton Main Street Board. The book evidently does not include Clinton, Missouri in its data. I would like to visit with the author regarding her statistics and question her as to why Clinton, Missouri was not included in the 2-hour radius of Kansas City, MO. Clinton has recently received an award as an All America City for the year 2000. With a population of approx. 10,000 and close in proximity to Truman Lake, we have a lot to offer. We are approximately 1/2 way between KC and Springfield, as the ""crow flies"". I am Project Manager for Clinton Main Street and can be reached at the above email address or my phone # is 660-885-2121. I would like to invite Shifra to our community and would like her to reconsider Clinton, Missouri as a viable tourist area within a 2-hour radius of KCMO.Thank you - Marsha Dark Project Manager Clinton Main Street PO Box 173 Clinton, MO 64735"
1,Urgh. Too much sarcasm- not enough real genuine information,"I am all for happy, funny pregnancy books- lord knows I have read enough of them. This book is the most sarcastic portrayal of pregnancy that I have read thus far and I thought I would really appreciate it...but the lack of true, genuine knowledge about pregnancy really made this book go downhill fast. This might have been a good read if it was the first book you happen to pick up about pregnancy but after you have read even a little about what happens to your body this book ceases to be funny when it makes fun of and pokes fun at every little minute detail.Read it if you haven't read anything else on the topic. Don't read it if you want to be intellectually stimulated and learn something new."
4,Great comic relief for the mom-to-be!!,"I received this book from a friend in about the 5th month of my first pregnancy. It was the perfect comic relief especially for the first time mom who tends to be so serious and over analitical. It gives advice in such an over the top funny way, such as ""...if you have to be told not to play with cat poop, maybe you shouldn't be a mother"" kind of stuff. It is almost a spoof on all the pregnancy advice you get and try to digest from everyone!! Really great comic relief!"
2,skip it,"This book would be more appropriate in the Humor section. It has very little useful information on pregnancy, and the humor is corny. If you want a humorous book that includes good information, try the Girlfriend's Guide -- it's full of information and a lot funnier."
1,Not at all Informative,"When the title says, ""You're Pregnant: A Guide for the Longest Nine Months of Your Life,"" I am looking for pertinent information on pregnancy and the headaches that go along with it. This book is not at all informative, and actually gives me a headache when I read it for more than 10 minutes at a sitting. This is a satirical look at pregnancy, and offers no help in answering questions or figuring out solutions to common pregnancy problems. A total waste of money."
1,Unpleasant smell,"I was very eager to try this new body oil. With the winter season coming, I was looking for something new to use after showering on my dry skin. It arrived yesterday, and I used it last night. When I went in to my teenage son's room, he looked oddly at me and said I smelled like I'd been with someone who had been smoking. (we are all non smokers) When I told my husband, he said that he didnt want to hurt my feelings, but had thought that I smelled like citronella. There must be some undertones to this fragrance, or it may be the combination of fragrances, that make this body oil unpleasant to smell. What a waste..."
5,All Killer No Filler from Mr. James Brown,"Not an album of Black Power manifestos, as the title would indicate (The Last Poets took care of that). This is a straight-up wonderful compilation of JB's best b-sides and singles from late 1967-68. Pts. 1 and 2 of the title cut (although somewhat poorly recorded) top it off. A smoking instrumental ""Shades of Brown,"" a short version of the down home soul of ""Licking Stick,"" The fine remake of ""Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye,"" and another instrumental ""Maybe I'll Understand"" make this a CD you can listen all the way thru without skipping a song. Good old down-home unadulterated soul at it's best!"
3,A bit soapy...but still interesting...,"Interesting movie about a seminal rocker but disappointing that there were no pieces or clips (except some later versions of ""Mary Lou"", ""Who Do You Love"" and ""Hey Bo Diddley"") from the late fifties with the Hawks in Canada. After Levon's death I was earnestly hoping I could see that phase of both their lives.... But a good movie nonetheless. If you want to hear the ORIGINAL ""Hey Bo"" and flip side ""Who Do""...look for the ""Roulette 45RPM"" version on You Tube. Still looking for the same on a CD or LP...."
4,Great Mood Chiller,"Maria Barranco is stellar in this Spanish paranormal thriller. What a find. She portrays a radio talk show hostess dealing in psychic phenomena and ventures to an eery Spanish village to find out the truth about her boyfriend's death. Everything about this film is creepy. The sound effects, music, lighting, camera angles and small village setting gives you the creeps from the get-go. And, just when you think you have the whole story figured out, you're greeted with a shocking ending. This has the feel of a classic horror flick but it's definitely not for the kiddies. To get the full effect, watch this in the dark."
4,"Very good, haunting film",Have to disagree with the other posters on this one. I thought it was terrific.
3,Ray's second Fania album.,"Ray Barretto's second Fania release finds him struggling to find himself (musically). While the hit tune ""Abidjan"" is a classic and both ""Mirame De Frente"" and ""Mi Ritmo Te Llama"" deserved a better fate the rest of the album is of merely average (as opposed to superior) musical quality. A major issue with this album is that its sound quality (even the remastered CD edition) is quite mediocre and leaves much to be desired. Was it mastered from an old 8-track tape or a pre-recorded cassette? I (honestly) don't know but I just don't think that the original masters were used on either the 2006 rematered edition or the (even worse) non-remastered 1995 edition."
3,Still In Between,"This 1968 Fania release,""Hard Hands"", finds Ray Barretto still mixing rythm and blues, jazz, and some funky stuff, with traditional afro-cuban music. Like trying to makeup his mind, what road to take. Nevertheless, for those hardcore ""salsa"" fans, these four selections pickup the slack pretty nice; ""Mi Ritmo Te LLama"", ""Son Con Cuero"", ""Ahora Sì"", and( Hugo Gonzàlez searing güaracha) ""Mìrame De Frente"". The great sonero, Adalberto Santiago is the lead singer on the just mentioned selections, except ""Son Con Cuero"". Willie Torres and Jimmy Sabater, both from Joe Cuba's Sextet fame roundup the chorus section. Barretto's subsequent LP's for the remainder of the 60's, all of the 70's, and into the 80's, sealed his legacy as one of ""Salsa's"" true giants."
5,Sweet book!!,"I liked this book because it wasn't too hard for me to read, but it was really interesting. I think that people should buy this book and read it because it's very good."
1,fiction,I thought this was a true story. It's not. Very boring. Donated it tothe library. Didn't even finish the book.
3,"el mustee, laundry sink","The sink installed easily and all the hardware was included with good instructions. It is exactly what I was looking for because it is a wall hung unit. I didn't want to sweep around legs of a floor mount unit as I installed it in my garage. The bad thing is it doesn't drain properly, There is a pond of water that remains in the center of the bottom. The manufacturer needs to take a look at this!"
5,Great little table,"Table and 2 chairs. Great value, but was missing screws. We opted to find our own, rather than wit to have them sent. However, 1 year old likes to sit at her table and share with her 4 year old sister."
1,"A review of the seller, not the cocoa","I'm sure this 6 oz can of cocoa will be very good, but over $11.00 for domestic shipping??????????? What a rip off!"
4,Child's review,"Stanley was hungry at night so he got out of bed and ate raisins besides the window while there had been a storm outside. He was still hungry so he ate an apple then he said ""I am not hungry now."" Stanley felt sort of wierd then he turned invisible.The best bit was when Stanley got back to normal because he was happy again.When Mrs Lampchop, Mr Lambchop, Arthur and Stanley went to Dr Dan he could not explain what was wrong with Stanley.This book is worth reading because it is fun and Stanley is a very clever boy.R.W."
5,Very good,"Although I'm not an expert and therefore cannot comment on whether this really is a complete manual, I can say that the book is very good. It's full of helpful examples (nicely placed in the margins) that help the reader develop good typographical intuitions. It is extremely accessible, even for a non-specialist, and from all that I can tell, it is quite comprehensive."
2,Too little typography on too many pages,"Sure enough, this books walks you, gentle reader, through some basic concepts of typography. But it contains too many explanations of terms and too little analysis of what these terms mean. It is also short on practical advice. For a good introduction to typography, take a look at Bringhurst: The Elements of Typographic Style, which will teach you much more. Bringhurst's book also has the advantage of being small enough so that you can carry it around at school or at work."
5,Manual of Typography,A must have if you are preparing a manuscript to be published as submitted and you want every detail to be typographically correct. It explains everything clearly for a novice and probably is useful to professionals as well.
2,Tasteless,"No flavor at all, so disappointed. Bought this based on the reviews and what a waste of money. Packed in water and taste like water. Say your money."
1,Big Disappointment,"The crab meat is bland, pulpy, over cooked, mushy, tasteless and usable only buried in soup or stew. It is not lump crab meat; it is pulverized crab mush.It is not good enough to make crab cakes or put in salad. I will figure out a use for it now that I have it, but I am sorry for the almost complete waste of money. In short, it's junk."
4,Not Worth The Extra Cost,"Received the product in good order. However, I could really not tell any difference from Crown Prince regular Lump White Crab Meat which sells for less. It is good, but not worth the extra cost."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This book was a disappointment! It doesn't tell you much that you don't already know, assuming you have a job and are out of your parents' house. I would have learned from it when I was 16, but having already been on my own for 7 years it was a complete waste of time and money. The unfortunate part is that there are a lot of references to drinking and a few about divorce, so it's not even suitable for teenagers. I didn't expect expert advice, but I was expecting some tips and strategies. The best advice I learned from the book...save your money and don't buy it!"
4,Inspired,"Minus just one peculiarly duff track featuring a couple of kids doing a sort of street rap, a brilliant synthy evocation of life, the people and the whole feel of the southern California coast, specifically Santa Monica, Venice and Manhattan Beach. A one off gem in fact, all the more surprising for having been conceived written and performed by two guys from Germany of all places ~ or perhaps not, as they would have had a different perspective on it all. This album brings back so many of the best memories of assorted visits to California ~ utterly indispensable for anyone who's ever been there."
5,Divas Rock,"I saw the concert, and loved it. I love all types of Music, so the Diva concerts are the highlight of April. Tina got the show of to a good and origional start. Elton suprised me, for I didn't think he could nold his own. I was surprised that only one Cher (solo) track was included (but considering she lip-synched her other one...). Brandy, even with a sore troat, shined, even when joined by Faith, and the larger Divas. Faith herself was excellent as a guest (she rocked on Divas 2000, too), so was LeAnne. Whitney was marvelous. Mary J., though she had only one song, greatly effected the concert with her presence. Chaka Kahn was nice too, as the surprise guest."
2,Not impressed,"Ordered the DVD and received the CD instead. The vendor was kind enough to give a refund. The body of work on the CD was nothing to write home about. Maybe the DVD would have brought more excitement to the performances, but via CD it just sounded overtried and underdone."
2,You call this divas,"As and avid Cher fan, who also likes Whitney Houston, I snapped up this nicely priced C.D. However, I am entirely dissapointed with this C.D purely becuase it only has two cher tracks on it. The only redeeming factor is that one of them is the Proud mary version with out Tina and Elton John.Bad album"
4,Proud Tina - THE Diva,"A decent recording of the star-spangled Diva event. Tina Turner is clearly the standout and should be considered the headliner. Whereas everyone else on the album tries so hard to reach Diva status, Tina achieves with a mere flick of that mane. Too bad they cut out the extended banter of the ""Proud Mary"" cut and Tina's soulful rendition of ""Let's Stay Together."" The actual Diva show was pretty much over one half-hour into it - once Ms. Turner exited the stage. The rest...Divas? Please - come back in 30 years and we'll see."
4,"ISN'T ""DIVA"" A DEROGATORY TERM?","ANYWAY, TINA TURNER IS THE QUEEN, SHE IS EXCELLENT AT 60! HER PERFORMANCE HERE IS TRULY MAGNIFICENT. CHER ALSO DOES A GREAT JOB, BUT AT ONLY 1 FULL SONG, I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE DONE MORE. I WAS ALSO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY JR. DIVA LEANN RIMES. WOW~! WHAT A VOICE."
2,Not much as a unified effort,"The lack of unity and the less than equal cast puts this at the bottom of my ""Must Have"" list. Tina is the only stand-out/with Elton backing..Cher is better than that old hit she sang, and the young ones...yawn! Whitney forced and uninspired."
5,Excellent Tool,"I have had this Lamson Sharp spreader for over 7 years and it is still practically like new. It's great for making any kind of sandwich, especially peanut butter, but also works well with things like mustard, mayo, etc. I like the serrated edge to cut the sandwich in half. I have also used it to frost a cake, and while probably not the optimal tool for the job, it's a lot better than an ordinary butter knife. The serrated edge can create interesting patterns in the frosting. Very well made."
1,comfy,I own three of these spreaders and just love them...it's like we used to have when i was a kid.....a real nice touch
1,Very Poor Program,VERY low resolution- not truly 3-d. Not able to zoom. Comletely worthless. Download the demo from the publishers website- complete junk!
3,Good but.....,"This watch is a good watch, efficient, easy to use, lightweight, etc.. However, the bad points would be the color. The band is white and blue so it does get very dirty looking (if you have an active lifestyle) and you can not take the band off the watch to wash it easily. It has rubber pieces that hold the band to the watch and if you damage one while removing the band(which I have not done)... it would be hard to fix. The watch itself is blue and white but I have already scratched off the white in one place and the blue is showing through. For the money it is a really good watch but it does have the one major flaw, its color. If you can live with that...go for it."
1,Bad Watch,I purchased this watch for my son to potty train him by using the timer feature. I broke the band before ever handing it to him. The band seperated from the watch. On day 2 there was fog inside the watch. I will be sending this back to Timex for repair under warranty.
2,in the beginning...,"in the beginning i really liked this watch, it was fulfilling its purpose in meeting my needs. then a few months later i noticed a few things that i didn't like, the band became discolored, and then the band started separating itself from the actual watch piece. whenever i wear it now, it inevitably falls out. i hear something hit the ground, look around for the watch piece (the band is still attached to my wrist) re-attach it and go on my way. i'm currently looking for a new watch."
4,"Finally, a book about Catharine Parr Traill (among others)","This book saved my term paper!! Finding material on 19th century Canadian author Catharine Parr Traill is very difficult,and this book is the only one I found that truly helped me for my essay.Of course, this book features other authors, such as Traill's sister, Susanna Moodie.But for anyone looking for a book that talks at length about Traill's work (fiction and non-fiction), this is THE ONE!!!"
5,Very Nice Nerf Bars,"These are well built nerf bars and look like a factory item after they are installed. These will take about an hour to install. The supplied directions will not be a lot of help if you are not mechanically inclined. The parts are stamped DF, DM, DR and PF, PM, PR which are for driver and passenger side front middle and rear respectively. The factory bolts that you remove are torqued in pretty tight and you will need a 1/2"" rachet drive with an extension bar to remove the bolts, an impact gun will make the job easier. I recommend this product for its build and finished look. These are very rigid and feel like they will last forever."
1,Obvious and contrived,"I loved the title of this book and I was greatly looking forward to reading it based on the reviews. I am an elementary school teacher and I have three children. I constantly read books on parenting and teaching. My family is vegetarian, we do not watch TV, we don't say we ""hate"" people, we don't allow toy weapons....I don't think in 2011 my family is so unusual. I completely agree with the ideas behind this book. Unfortunately, the tone of the book felt self-congratulatory and every example in the book ended with a rosie, unrealistic finale. I also felt like the book was describing very obvious solutions. I think that modern day, educated parents are not raising children in the way the book describes. Of course we are kind, of course we don't allow small children to watch violent things on TV, of course we respect the earth....I just found the tone patronizing and i guess not very helpful."
4,Above all be kind,This book has a combination of philosophical justification and useful tips for guiding children. It is not quite as user friendly as some books for parents.
4,excellent bat,"Amazon had this bad on sale for $[...], my son purchased it with is birthday money. It seem to be a very good base, we will find out for sure when league starts."
5,Ceramic brake pads,"I got these pads installed, along with centric premium rotors, a little before christmas so they've been on the vehicle for about 4 months. They are great pads that I'm hoping to get many many miles out of. I haven't had any sort of sounds at all and I feel like the dust is very low as well. Just make sure you use the proper lube in all the spots when doing a brake job. Doing it right the first time will make sure that you don't have problems/sounds down the line."
3,Shoes,"I really like the shoes and they fit, but I just wish they had a slightly slicker bottom so that I can glide on the floor easier. Maybe an additional suede piece or something added to the heel. I tend to skid a bit."
1,Horrible,"This remote control is horrible!!!I bought one last month, I felt so happy at first because it really worked good. but horrible things happened after I bought the second one. I selected channel2 for my second remote and receiver, but it didn't work. Then I selected channel3 for my remote and receiver, didn't work again! Then I realized that only channel1 and channel8 could work, but when I use my older remote which has been set at channel1, I found that it can also turn on my second receiver which has been set at channel8! Later I found that with a remote which has been set to channel1, can turn on any receivers in any channel.I hope I can give zero star because it is totally useless if you use more than one. I found that the only way to solve this problem is select different ""HOUSE CODE"". Horrible!!!"
4,All rubber floor mats,"Not quite what I was expecting....so there are no carpet on these mats, they are 100% rubber. If you're OK with that (which I was) they do look great, and are quite tough. However, if you are expecting carpeted rugs then look elsewhere."
4,fanmats 49er mats,They are just like the photo and look good in the car too! Nicer looking than the rubberized ones I've seen.
2,Love the boys but...,"This is basically an ad for the different calls that Phil and the boys are selling. Unless you are looking to start a collection of calls, this is not for you. Very little actual instruction. Oh well. Will still watch Duck Dynasty!"
2,Decent CD with some quality calls but not very instructional,I expected some instruction on the mechanics and articulations of various duck calls. This CD is basically showcasing Duck Commanders various calls and product lines.
4,Herb Alpert & the TJB Christmas Album - A Holiday Classic!,"I've been a fan of Herb Alpert since I was about 10 years old (I'm 43 now). I first bought the Christmas Album in 1969 and promptly wore it out. This album brings back fantastic memories of my childhood in the 60's and is still relevant today. Of particular mention are Herb's version of ""Winter Wonderland"", which is so hot it melts Parson Brown, and ""Jingle Bell Rock"" with the stripper coda reminiscent of David Rose. If you wanna remember Christmases of the mid to late 60's, buy this album. There were a lot of imitators back then, but Alpert stands the test of time!"
5,Classic Bone cut,"This is one of the most creative, interesting, enjoyable, and positive rap albums I have ever heard, let alone Bone albums. I am a die-hard Bone fan, but I gotta admit, when I heard Lay's album, I was a little worried. Then I picked this up. I loved it at first, but then it started growing on me, and still is. Every song is great, but the best are Never Grow, Murderah, Before I Go, and Don't Doubt Me. I wouldn't give any song under 4 stars.P.S. Cheese Sandwich, you obviously hate on Bone, so don't even write a frickin review. You're just lowering the score of a great album from a group you don't even like."
5,Very Tight!!!,Go Get IT!!!!! diffrent from the first but better! Not as dark and more melody. He still carrys bone thugs on his shoulder. A couple songs sound a little too r&bish but the rest are banging. He has deffinetly lived up to his expetations!
2,Confusing,"The book is a good intro to some interesting topics in differential geometry but it does not give a clear presentation of the concepts and as a result is very confusing. Most confusing, however, are the solutions in the back of the book (that hardly help and are indecipherable for the most part)."
2,Dissapointing,"The book starts ok, but very quickly deteriorates into the classical boring math style of theorem-proof. There are a million books on the subject matter, and I don't see the need of another one which is pretty much identical. It is not a bad book, but has absolutely no added value - just pick any of the differential geometry books out there, and they will be the exact same thing. Why do they bother writing the same book over and over??"
3,Good Info Bad Recipes,"The information is helpful. It was a very good starting point for me and ""Clean Eating"". However, this book lacks good editing. Some recipes list ingredients, but never tell you when to add them. Others tell you to can substitute something, but don't tell you how much to use. Also there are some recipes that just suck.If you are an experienced cook, should be able to figure out how to finish the recipes. His new cookbook is better, but still not perfect."
2,Resin & Incense,"Far too technical for my needs. Unfortunately, one could not determine that fact from the amount of information given prior to the purchase."
4,Passion and Fire,"I enjoyed all of the selections on this album. A couple are old favorites from a previous album. Only one or two selections are in the ""OK, But Not a Favorite"" category. Generally, that's because they are a bit too wild for my taste. However, others who like Barbieri's super firey style may like them."
5,Superb!!,"This book is simply superb, eloquent and very well written. In a sea of philosophical and theological books on the subject of th ephilosophy of atheism, A Call To Sanity stands on its own simply because of its clarity and tone.Highly recommended to all readers of Dawkins, Harris and Schermer"
3,"meh, it's just ok","the drawings/pictures are beautiful, and very fun, but the poems aren't that great. The meter in some is off, and so, the rhythm isn't great. However, I still think it's a really fun book, and considering I paid less than $2 for this, I really shouldn't complain. It's a good bargain book, though I probably wouldn't pay more for it."
4,Herb grooves!,"This is a collection of Herb Alpert's post-TJB recordings. It shows Herb in more of a street setting. The funkiness of ""Rise"", the smoothness of ""Route 101"", and the futuristic sounds of ""Beyond"" are just a few treasures here. He also displays some of his finest jazz soloing on ""Rotation"", and especially ""It's All For You"". The sound of the recording is great, also. The one dissapointment is his version of ""Maniac"", which does nothing for me. But fortunately there is so much other things here that will pick you up. ""Magic Man"" is another jewel! Classy music from a classy artist!"
2,"Great Stuff, Bad Pressing","This is indeed great stuff. The music is exceptional. It gyrates, especially Fandango. But the sound is almost dead silent. It's as if the people engineering the music decided to turn down dramatically the amplification. Be careful because you have to raise the volume extremely high to hear the music. The moment you hear a new CD, it may blow your speakers. If any CD cries out for remastering, this one must be at the very front!"
2,Doesn't do very much,"I bought this in size Small-Black, and have been very disappointed at how loose it fits. I have tank tops that are tighter than this body wrap! Frankly, I would have been better off with $3 hosiery. This wrap is practically worthless."
1,ehhh...,"This is comfortable, but absolutely no shaping whatsoever. Its no more ""shapewear"" then a regular pair of underwear.It is comfortable, but for the price, would never have bought it if I'd known that.two thumbs down"
1,Drive Format Failure !!!! - Not Reliable,"I owned this Buffalo P.O.S. for about 10 months before it failed. There seams to be some sort of hardware flaw that damages the file partition. When this happens, the drive will not be recognized under windows or mac computers. Though, the files are still intact, you must own or purchase file recovery software to recover your data.It is unfortunate for me, I was in the process of reorganizing all my photos and documents and was using this drive as my primary storage because of the RAID feature. It's going to take me a very long time to recover all the data I had stored on the drive. The drives are still good but the buffalo housing is going into the trash can. I will not trust the Buffalo Brand ever.Save yourself time and $$$ and DON'T BUY this drive."
2,Failing drives,"The drives are finicky. They have failed twice in the past year and take a long time to rebuild, usually wiht a loss of data."
5,A Delightful Tale,"Jimmy Carter has many facets to his personality, and it is charming to see one of them displayed here with his story of a crippled child. I am sure the Carter children and grandchildren all enjoyed hearing him share this one over the years. I bought this for my niece's fifth birthday. She will enjoy the colorful illustrations by Amy Carter, also. I recommend this book for any public or private library."
5,Not a hint of anti-semitism,"I braced myself for the usual Jimmy Carter jew-bating in this book, but was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Snoogle-Fleejer wasn't a Zionist oppressor and roadblock to mideast peace. Good job, Jimmy!"
1,MacDraft - Poor choice for 2D drafting,The user interface is typical Mac - very good. The software as a drafting tool is unsatisfactory. The ability to locate objects with respect to other objects is not supported. The most important snaps are not supported. You can't draw a line from a snapped to point because the software only supports the snap function for second and subsequent points. You can't snap to the intersection of two lines etc etc.This software looks pretty when you start it up but is wholly inadequate to do any precision drawing. You can't even draw two circles with the same center point!
5,Popeye,"As an owner of volumes 1, 2, and 3, I will tell you that I love them all and they are so much fun."
5,"""I YAM WHAT I YAM""","Start your Popeye collection with ""POPEYE THE SAILOR: 1933-1938."" All the classics as you remembered them are here uncut and uncensored with all the original paramount introductions. Great for all ages and a definte collectors item. Don't miss out on the fully restored original versions of the first ever Popeye cartoons!"
1,Missing Disc One,"My set, purchased in shrink wrap from an Amazon third party vendor, had two disc fours and no disc one. I just discovered this seven months after the purchase. No quality control at the factory."
3,Same old cartoons in B&W,"I bought this DVD in hopes of seeing some Popeye that I had not seen before, with the exception of the early (1936?) versions of ""Sinbad the Sailor"" ""AliBaba and the 40 Thieves, both in color by the way and one other B&W; cartoon, I had seen every one of these cartoons in color on ""Boom"", a cartoon channel available on cable. The cartoons seen on ""Boom"" are exact copies of the cartoons offered on this DVD, except that they are in color. The color versions of these cartoons were made from about 1948-1953 and have been in the public domain for a very long time.I really thought that I would be seeing some Popeye cartoons for the first time, so I was quite disappointed with the selections on this disc.The cartoons are however timeless in their entertainment value and I'll be keeping this DVD in my collection."
1,Beware - not for kids,"My 7-year-old has recently enjoyed a Popeye cartoon in a ""classics"" collection we have. I purchased this set for him for Christmas. Upon receiving the set, we discovered the small print on the back of the box: ""may not be suitable for children."" This disclaimer is not clearly given on the website; it should be in bold caps. I don't appreciate being misled in this way. We returned the set unopened."
4,I'll give this a 5 star review after i find out...,"Are these going to be double sided discs? if so the rating may go down to 3 stars (i hate double sided DVDs)...also...will this have a play all function? I hope so...well aside from these two issues...this may well be one of the great cartoon releases of this year...if you can afford it, get it..."
2,Sorry - Not Impressed,"I ordered this DVD set as a gift for my husband. We both looked forward to viewing these old ""classic"" cartoons. Despite our appreciation for vintage movies, books and TV, this series proved to be a disappointment. While keeping in mind the time they were produced (1930s), they are still unfunny, unentertaining and extremely violent. They story is always the same, only placed in a different setting each time. It gets a bit old when viewing all of them in a block of time. I wouldn't waste my money unless you find this sort of viewing entertaining and don't get bored by repetition."
5,10 stars! Terrific! Four Thumbs up!,"Folks, buy this set now. Don't hesitate, just buy it. In a word, this set is absolutely outstanding! I had tried the Thunderbean DVD earlier that contained a few public domain titles and, quite frankly, thought I had outgrown Popeye. I was able to view this new set from Warners, and let me tell you, these cartoons are great! For adults and kids alike. They're very funny & entertaining, with fun music & great gags and very likable, classic characters. This is some of the best cartoons ever produced. The picture quality is also amazing on these shorts. Don't mess with any other Popeye DVD--this is the one to get, trust me. Volume 2 is due out next year and I can't wait! It even makes me want to eat my spinach!"
5,Where's Jeep?,"Did I miss something, or is the little ""opossom like"" animal character called Jeep not in this box set. His picture is featured on the box, but, I do not see him in any of the episodes. Any help out there?"
5,Excellent Purchase,This box set beats any of the currently released Popeye DVD's. I have purchased others where they have overdubbed new sound effects and edited other material. It was horrible. I purchased this and couldn't be happier. My kids and I can't wait for the second installment to come out.
5,Fantastic!,"If you like Popeye, you must get this collection. 60 episodes with bonus features well worth watching. The packaging is also excellent.Update 11-2009, this is just an awesome set of cartoons. A must have for Popeye fans.Update 10-2010 Price has dropped to $25!"
5,New Smashin' punk icons on the road,"MOst of new punk rock really ...,but take a look to this band and to these 2001 ep....it's nice,punker than many bands out there,fast and furious....not making references to that lame movie......the invasion of within it's the real thing...you gotta buy it and try some rufio,dead stanleys or brain slop instead those new wave hairy lame nalgas from new found glory or sum 41......bass!!!!"
4,Revived my musical tastes,"This band, along with Belvedere, Daycare Swindlers, White Stripes, Hopesfall, Descendents, Queen Adreena and Hopesfall reawakened my love for music. I have come full circle back to the punk I grew up on. These guys made me want to go and re-purchase the Stooges and Dead Kennedys. Tsunami Bombs sound is tactile. You can wrap yourself in the guitar riffs and feel every punch of the lead singer. If you like punk that is a little bit pop (the kind of pop that was before ""pop"" became a dirty word), you'll like this and the other Tsunami Bomb albums."
4,Real Rockers,"Tsunami Bomb rocks. I love their music, the beats and vocals are awesome. If you are info punk, rock, alternative, or indie you need to listed to this band. Just listed to 20 going on... which is on Ultimate Escape.I wish this band was still together."
4,Redundant PSUs,"... hardware. Totally unnecessary for anything but critical server usage, but in that arena, these fellas operate like RAID for power supply. Don't confuse these with uninterruptable or backup power that keep your system running even if the power goes out (e.g., during a storm). Use these on the expectation that any PSU will eventually falter or *fail*, at which point the redundant unit is there to kick in. Then you ""hot swap"" in another functioning unit and smile."
3,basic robe,It is your basic hogwarts robe. Inexpensive and cheep maternal but will last. If it gets messed up your not out that much. Just what I needed. A good product for parties or Halloween.
3,Not that durable.,"The gown is made of some cheap material, so use it sparingly. It is prone to wear and tear."
1,It just tastes like salt.,"OK, believe it or not, I was a Kraft Mac and cheese virgin. No kids and genrally cook from scratch. I don't usually indulge in M&C, but though I'd finally give it a try. Beyond gross....And, btw, if you have gotten used to eating like this, ""step away from the box"". 860mg. of salt per serving, how did I miss that. And let's face it, most of us would probably eat a little more than one small serving. Save yourself!(and all your vital organs)"
1,Yuck! Really Gross sauce & with 900 MG sodium per serving!,My sister told me she liked this Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe. Guess that should have caused me to not try it as she is really addicted to salt.Wow! It is really awful. I followed directions and tasted it. YUCK!!! Horrible and WAY OVER SALTED. Then I checked ingredients and found it has 900 MG sodium per each serving. GROSS! The entire thing got dumped. Trash the only place for it.
5,This just made my day!,Every grocery store I know of stopped selling the Sharp Cheddar flavor of Kraft Deluxe Mac & Cheese... The sharp cheddar flavor is superior to all other flavors... Thank god I just renewed my Amazon prime membership! This is the best mac & cheese known to man. Seriously.
4,Mac & Cheese bulk,"Amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac & cheese is great, we can't get our five year old to stop eating it...price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store..."
4,Another Great Tool,"Being a remodeling contractor I usually give my tools quite a workout. As usual Milwaukee comes through again with a collection of fine tools at an affordable price. I've tried the ""Big Yellow Ones"" but they don't hold up like a ""Milwaukee"". I guess the only bad comment I can think of about the whole package is the sawzall seems to use up batteries pretty fast. I would recommend having at least 3 total if you plan to use the sawzall for extended periods. By the time one charges up the other is completely dead. The hand saw, drill and work light seem to operate forever on a battery. I would highly recommend this product if you do a lot of quick in and out jobs where you don't want to drag extension cords and tools around. The contractor bag works great keeping track of your tools and ease of transportation. I plan to buy a couple more of these packages for my crew."
4,It is like reading my own son's story:,"I thought that Polis really captured what it is like to have ADD from the child to adult perspective. What captured me about the book, was the fact that while I was reading it, I felt like I was reading my own son's story. I have loved my own son unconditionally through some very trying times, mostly with the school system and the athletic programs. For the first time, I felt like we were not alone. I am even thinking about starting a support group up using the book as a basis for discussion. Every educator should read this book, so they can feel what it is like to live with ADD and have a greater understanding of the ADD person. Thank you, Ben, for taking the risk to write your story."
5,Great product!,"I used several sheets of these labels on a color laser, and I had no jams. The color didn't smear. Nice thickness. Excellent all around."
1,Labels do not stick!,"I bought this product and wish I never did. The labels never stick to the envelope. They start peeling immediately no matter what kind of envelope I use. I have to tape down the label every time I use one. Well, at least I only have oh, 500 labels to go. Not recommended!!!"
4,quite good,"it is expensive, cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples, as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers, no difference."
4,Great product,Good product but it is overpriced elsewhere. Much more money elsewhere than here which is why it is a fantastic value.
5,Discovery In Time by Janet Litherland,"This is,in my opinion, excellent. Story line kept me interested so much so I had to read it all the way through before I could put it down. Light readiing. Very interesting ending.Loved it!!!!!!!!!"
5,Most Excellent,"I am very pleased with this generator. I'm not exactly Tony the toolman, but this was a breeze to start up and to attach the wheel kit. Just added gas and oil started on the first pull. I'm just waiting or the electrician to show up and install the transfer switch and I'll be ready for most anything. I was told that since my furnace is gas and don't have a well pump that I'll be able to hook up most of my house. The shipping with ABF was a little tedious, I had to leave work and arrange a meeting place, but the driver was cool and helpfull. Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow."
4,Great product so far.,"I have used this generator for a few small jobs so far. Worked great. Very easy to start. Large fuel tank. Plenty of amp capacity for startup amperage. Manual could be a little clearer on wiring the plug (inc) for 220v. Shipping sucked, took forever. ABF lost it, then found it, so I said, leave it where it is, I'll come and get it. Product 5 stars so far, minus 1 star for shipping."
1,This thing is junk!,"The first time I need to use it, it fails! The spark plug fouls out every one to two hours. I had to clean the plug, and reinstall it, just to keep it running. When it was running, it did provide enough power to keep my house going. But for 5 days, that's a lot of spark plug cleaning! I suggest you buy a different brand."
5,"Porter-Cable BSI550-W 5,500 Watt Generator","I received this generator on 12-03-02. I purchased it to supply electricity to my home during power outages. I installed a transfer switch beside my main electrical panel and tried it out. It worked better than I had anticipated, running my 220 volt artesian well pump, my oil fired furnace, my refrigerator freezer, TV and many lights. I made sure the refrigerator's compressor was on, the furnace was running and the well pump was cycling so that I would be sure it would work during a real power outage. This generator started on the first pull and ran great. On the same day I received it, I saw the same generator at Lowes for eighty two dollars less, but customer service would not give me back one red cent."
5,Yummy!,"I've enjoyed other Crown Prince products so I took a chance and tried this. The first bite said ""unique taste"", by about the 5th bite (quickly acquired taste) it was already a favorite. This has a unique flavor which quickly grows on you AND can be eaten by itself directly from the can (no preparation required). I've already gone through most of the case in less than a week. Wishing that I had ordered more of this one on the Crown Prince special."
1,bad to the bone,take a cup of salt water add smoke and drink it that how bad it was in my opinion yepper full of salt
5,AWESOME MOVIE!,"This Movie is unbelieveble.It is the funniest movie i've ever watched.If you look past the bad acting, the horrible dubbing, you get a great family film. In fact, the bad acting and dubbing add to the hilarity of this film. A must have for holiday Movie Buffs and who ever wants to laugh harder thatn they ever have.5 STARS!!!!"
2,Santa Claus 1959,"I bought this movie, because I remember seeing it when I was a little boy ""4-6 years old"". It scared me when I was a boy with the man dressed in a red devil costume.I don't know why anyone in their right mind would make a movie about Santa that could scare little children.The movie stuck out in my mind all these years and I wanted to see what was so scary to me as a little boy. As an adult it is not scary. It is not a movie I would recommend for children."
3,Decent but disposable,"I used the frying pan once over a small camp stove to cook bacon and eggs. It worked fine for cooking, but when I cleaned it I noticed spots of the nonstick surface came off. I didn't use any metal to cook with or clean it. It did come clean, but after a few uses, I imagine the nonstick surface will be worn. I don't see getting very many uses out of this set. Which is unfortunately, because it is fairly well-made, light, and packs up nice."
3,Open Country 5-Piece Mess Kit meets my hiking needs,"The mess kit is basically a silicone coated aluminum scout mess kit. Not as good as titanium... however, at less than $8.00 I feel much better when I lose, bend or destroy it during my hikes."
2,disappointed,"This mess kit is not top of the line, and I didn't expect it to be for the price. This kit does not nest together...... The description doesn't say that it will, but one assumes that it would. Very unhandy."
2,"""Nonstick"" MESS","The idea of me spending more money was so that I would get a better ""deal"" right? Well this was absolutely not the case. I just got gypped out of an extra $10. First of all, the whole messkit doesn't even fit together. I have to bend the bar to even get it to shut. I've owned messkits in the past, and this just does NOT go together properly. It was supposed to be nonstick... that was a joke. Even with oil in the pan, things stuck to it just as bad, if not worse than a regular pan. Also, the pot looked fine, the cup looked fine... and the lid looked fine... but the pan itself came to me (was supposed to be brand new) completely scratched up. It honestly looked like it had been used for a few years, then scrubbed down real good to look and smell clean and then thrown in here. It was NOT new.I will make it a point to never buy from that seller ever again."
4,"Great standard mess kit, nonstick","Good, all around mess kit. I read complaints about the nonstick surface wearing off quickly. This isn't the case at all. I imagine people using abrasive cleaning methods. Also, I oil my set before I set out on the trail, which I'm sure helps out as well. This set is pretty sturdy, cooks pretty evenly with no discoloration. I would definitely recommend this set for the price/quality."
3,Sticky Subject,"I purchased this kit to be able to cook for 5 people (2 adults and 3 kids). I was impressed with the versatility of the kit. What I was dissappointed with the the ""non-stick"" coating. I have had cheap mess kits with better non-stick coating. It held up well, but was too sticky for my taste. I guess I'll just drag along a spray bottle of cooking oil next time."
5,"Flow Music, great for mind and body","One of the best ""flow"" albums ever recorded. Can be listened to over and over and is always enjoyable. Listen carefully for the hidden lyrics."
4,Management of Technology That Makes Sense,I found this book very helpful and rich in content. We use this book for our MBA in Strategic Management course.
3,ATTRACTIVE ???????,"I OWN THIS PARTICULAR LIGHT. IT HAS PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVE FEATURES ONE COULD WANT WITH PIVITAL HEAD ETC. THE EXCEPTIONAL PROBLEM IS A BIG ONE!!! I REPLACE "" 4 "" BATTERIES AFTER LESS THEN 8 HOURS OF TOTAL USE WHICH CAN BECOME EXPENSIVE, ONCE WEEKLY ! NEXT TIME, I'LL TRY AN "" LED "" BOOKLIGHT THAT OFFERS CHOICE OF SOFT/BRIGHT LIGHT FEATURES, AS MOST WILL WORK ON JUST "" 2 "" BATTERIES LASTING FOR 20 HOURS .HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE ELSE ."
4,Classical Joplin,"Katia and Marielle Lebeque play the rag notes distinctly so you can clearly hear the harmonies. Listening to them I could understand why Joplin's music came to be listed in the classical section of the Schwann catalog. I can hear the new sonorities he developed.At the same time, the Lebeques maintain the ragged time rhythm and the fun of the rags they play. I use this cd in class at times to demonstrate the transition from traditional classical on the beat rhythms to syncopated rhythm. It is a very enjoyable record."
2,WHERE'S THE SONG WILD WORLD?,"It's okay for a complete collection but expect for one song selection to add Cat Stevens own ""Wild World"" which is not included on this CD. But i'd rather prefer his greatest hits compilation album instead for that particular tune that's on there for sure!"
4,An Interesting And Unusual Story,"I am a huge fan of Patricia Veryan's, and love to read her books. However, I have been disappointed with the entire ""Riddle"" series. Although she still excells at writing descriptions of places and people that are vivid, there is something missing. The reader does not get to know the characters well: what they are feeling, their motivations, the reason they do the things they do. There is also less of the romance and humorous episodoes that made her older books so charming. Still, any book by Patricia Veryan is better written than by many other authors, and I would recommend her books to anybody. I just hope she writes another book like ""The Mandarin of Mayfair""."
4,a Moderate tale from Veryan,"I'm rating this book only four stars because you can't just pour praise on everything lest it all merges.Her Riddle series really isn't as enjoyable as some of her (I belive) later work such as the League of the Jewelled Men or the Georgian ones.However, they are still yards and leagues above any of the paltry regency paperbacks that abound on the market, from authors such as Mary Jo Putney, etcetera etcetera.They have CONTENT!!!First read her better novels, then read this series, and then go for a second round with the Jewelled Men and so on - Particular favorite of mine is the Wagered Widow."
2,More mystery then romance,"I thought the mystery part good, who set up Hastings Adair and why. But I thought the romance part lacking. I did not feel any real chemistry from these two, in fact I don't see what or why they are attracted to each other. The only thing I can figure is Hastings is so grateful that a woman believes in his innocence he mistakes that for love. And Alice feels so bad about believing his guilt and trying to kill him, she mistakes the guilt for love.The mystery was really good, I never figured the person who was the master mind, but next time the author needs to develop the chemistry of the two main characters. I read the other reviews and this is my first Veryan book so I don't have anything to compare it to. I am going to read the first two, hopefully they will be better then ""The Riddle of the Reductant Rake""."
4,Good Small Bag,"My Nikon D60 with an 18-55 kit lens and battery charger snugly fits in the bag. There is no room for anything else.The build quality is quite good. Nice Padding. Two additional pockets on the side. Good Looks, Nice deisgn on the outside.The only con is that the zippers are not of very good quality..Other wise a very good bag for those have just a DSLR and no additional lens. One of the lowest priced ones available :-)"
2,Survival of the Fittest by Kellerman,"For this book, I was expecting a suspense/thriller and it was my first Kellerman read. The book arrived very quickly because I was excited to read this book after a review."
4,Solid Suspense and Intrigue w/Comic Relief,"Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels never fail to deliver entertainment. Survival of the Fittest is no different. The plot carries a sustained suspense to the climax that will satisfy all the amateur detectives amongst you. The special treat for readers of Delaware novels is the comic relief provided by the interactions of Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware...or for that matter Milo Sturgis and just about any other character. Have fun with this and get your dose of intrigue, too. And if you enjoy some comic relief with your suspense novels, check out the characters of Benny Post and Tim DeMornay in the thriller,Evil, Be Gone."
2,a real effort to stay awake,I have a corner in my room that I throw bad books in. The pile just got bigger
2,It Just Wasn't That Good,This book was highly recommended by a friend. I don't get it. I was at least interested in the story to read the ENTIRE thing but it just wasn't that good. I have only read one other book by Jonathan Kellerman and don't plan to read anymore. I want to really be entertained and this didn't do it.
3,its drown out,i Like The Story line But There Was to Much Down Time in Setting up the plot Could Have beed About 100 pages shorter
2,Moves Too Slowly To Hold Your Interest,"While the plot is interesting, Kellerman allowed the story to drag along at much too slow a pace for very long passages to hold my interest.After reading over one-half of Survival Of The Fittest, I skipped to the ending as I could't take the poor pacing any longer. I guess one might say I wasn't fit enough to survive this slow-moving story."
2,Survival of the Fittest,"I recently slogged through this book, continuing to hope that somehow it would get better. The plot was tedious and unbelievable. The ending was lame. The characters were boring. By the end, I really didn't care what happened to the main character who, himself, was a bore. I am one who generally finishes books within a week or so - sometimes over a weekend, or even overnight if they're really good. After about four weeks, I'm happy to say goodbye forever to Jonathan Kellerman."
2,"This was my first, and last, kellerman novel.","While the plot kept the book moving and readable, it ended quickly, poorly, and dissapointed me after 500 pages. I don't think I will pick up another kellerman novel because this one ended so poorly."
2,disappointing &lacking in creative antigonist,"Although I have always looked forward to the Alex Delaware mystery, Kellerman's latest books are a huge disappointment. Survival of the Fittest had no character development or understanding of its one dimensional antagonists whose motive was 'just because I can'. Such a disappointment. Dr. Kellerman, where are those clever books with credible characters and plausable situations keeping your readers on the edge of their seats? The conclusion of this book was not worthy of the story leading up to it. I miss When the Bough Breaks and many of the earlier stories with psychology woven tightly with the mystery. Please give us real problems with villians we can understand and appreciate. If not, have the bad guys wear mustaches and black hats."
4,Very dark,"Though When the Bough Breaks was hardly ""light"" reading, it seems that author Jonathan Kellerman's view of the human race is becoming darker if his characters are any reflection of that view. This is a disturbing book on many levels, but especially in terms of the loss of a moral compass experienced by some of the book's characters.But it's also the fine writing that I have come to expect from Kellerman. I can quibble about the irrelevance of his red herring; I am never happy with a mystery writer who gives me a puzzle that is not really soluble by me, the reader. But that's a small quibble about a book that I devoured."
2,A Bit Below Kellerman's Usual,"To me it feels as if you've read one Alex Delaware novel, you've read them all. Book after book, Alex's life changes slightly and that is incorporated in the books, a nice touch. The large part of this book is usual Kellerman fare, with unsual cases from Delaware and Sturgis coming together coincidentally. And as the plot unfolds, the pieces slowly come together. In the end, our hero usually saves the day. In _Survival of the Fittest_ however, he is knocked unconscious and really doesn't do much except fight to stay awake. Just like I did by the end of it. Yawn."
3,Not exactly a page-turner,"This book dragged a bit. There are lengthy descriptions of one character watching another search the Internet extensively without result, or of a detective making numerous telephone calls that don't produce information. Milo and Alex do a lot of repetitive brainstorming, going over and over and over the same material. As other reviewers have mentioned, the latter half of the investigation doesn't seem exactly linked to the murders.I was surprised to read in the ""Top 500"" reviewer's response that ""A serial killer has been shooting persons with mental and physical challenges."" None of the victims are shot."
1,Horrible,"The first Kellerman novel I have ever read. The build up in characters and plot is scarce. The settings change too frequently, and there was far too much dialogue. I can't believe a book this horrible would exist."
2,out of all his books this is the worst,I have read all the Alex Delaware novels and this was the most boring. The plot didn't make sense and very disappointed in the story line.
2,The mystery has been submerged in jargon and sex,Kellerman has written a series of excellent books dealing with criminal psychiatry. This book is a poor example. It deals with porn and description rathder than mystery. I became bored one third of the way through with repetition. His many other books havew rated 4-5 stars but this falls far short of his usual ability.
2,Skimmed the last 200 pages,I lost interest in this book part way through. There were far too many plot twists. The book seemed to lurch spasmodicaly through the mystery.Deleware's relationships were relatively flat and his relationship with Robin had no depth or feeling. This was my first Alex Delaware book and I found I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters.I think it's interesting that the used versions are being sold for a penny. Hits the nail on the head.
3,Kellerman usually hooks your immagination and holds it firm.,"Kellerman usually hooks your immagination and holds it firm. In this novel, Dr. Alex Deleware is brought into a scene uncharacteristic of his profession, and thus it quickly becomes unbelievable. The story drags on through the middle pages leaving you bored stiff with the ""intellectual"" dialogue. Only in the last quarter inch does the plot thicken and the pace quicken. The result is a bit of a twisted ending leaving you wonder why you bothered in the first place. I think Kellerman is showing signs of having to dig really deep to come up with tantalizing fiction. Perhaps, after Billy Straight and a novel apparently ready to follow, he should take a long rest."
4,Loved this book!! Couldn't wait until the finale!!,"As an avid reader of Kellerman's work, I HAVE to read each new book to keep up with Milo, Alex, Robin and Spike. I feel as if I'm part of an extended family! I especially like the way Milo is described in such detail, and Kellerman makes me love him like he's some big squishy bear... Bravo Alex and Robin for being such good friends, and Kellerman, keep up the good work. I can't wait until Milo is promoted!!! He deserves it. And last, but not least, Thank God! Daniel's fate is revealed in the end. I was getting a little worried there..."
3,Falls short of previous Alex Delaware books.,"Marred by too much axe-grinding on Arab/Israeli politics and the politics of IQ testing. Chapter 31 can be skipped entirely, Chapter 28 almost entirely. Daniel Sharavi begins as an intriguing character, rapidly becomes a bore--unfortunately, since he plays a major role in the second half of the book."
3,Alex Delaware has gone too far!,"Being an avid Kellerman fan, I could hardly wait to read this one and was terribly disappointed! Too many characters, none of which are well-defined. But I eagerly await his next book!"
4,A good page turner.,This was my first Kellerman book to read and I found it to be pretty good. It was a little too descriptive but the suspense kept me going. I would recommed it to others.
4,Not one of his best,I have read all of Kellerman's books and found this to be one of the least enjoyable. The subject matter is getting more grim with each passing novel and I thought the overlong section on eugenics boring. Where was Robin in this novel? Doesn't Alex ever do anything other than work with Milo? I also thought the ending was over before it began and it leaves you feeling slightly incomplete. I usually really race through his novels but this one didn't do it for me.
5,He just keeps getting better!,"Kellerman again projects his talents in sleuthing/ psychology in his element of the Los Angeles/Silverlake area, taking on the survivalists and bringing back a character I didn't think I would see again. Excellent reading."
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this vacuum and will need to return it after one use. The suction on the vacuum doesn't work and I tried to call but there was no response - they said they have a phone problem and dont know when it will be fixed! They said there will be quite a delay in the response. I was excited to get the product but now won't consider it again! Time to package it up and send it back. Wonder if there is anyone there to get the vacuum? I hope I get a full refund
1,Biggest Disappointment!!,"I was so excited about the Halo as my husband is allergic to dust mites. The first time I used it, it smelled as clean as a hospital, but that faded and within a couple of months, I had to use room freshener after each use. After less than a year, something got stuck in the vacuum cleaner. When we opened it up, we were astounded and disgusted with what we saw - filthy dust everywhere! Dust was caked all over the internal working electrical components inside the vacuum cleaner! That sealed the deal for us. It went in the trash! This piece of junk is not even worth 1 star!"
2,I should of read my Consumer Reports magazine before I bought it.,"HIGHS, ease of use, decent build quality, versatility, cool concept (killing germs while you vacuum)LOWS, very noisy, poor deep cleaning on carpets, price, replacement parts are expensive and may be hard to findVERDICT, More of a conversation piece than a real vacuum."
1,Bought Halo in July Stopped working August ..used 5 times,"I bought this Halo Vacuum at Sears Outlet in Va Beach, I was thrilled to finally get a nice vacuum..I have never had an expensive vac.. I used it about 5 times..it is just my hubby and me, retired and we are not too messy..I used it maybe 5 times and the motor locked up..it will not run..I live 2 hours away from the point of purchase..I am so very upset..I just wanted a clean house..now I wish I had bought anything else..I have had other vacs only costing 50 bucks to last longer...WHAT GIVES With this..HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING, MONEY GONE...HUBBY is an I TOLD YOU SO...HOUSE needs CLEANING,,, I do not recommend you spend your good hard earned money on this phony machine..you will be lucky if it lives the 30 day warranty..rip off..and I do not have the money to get another one..so now I have to sweep off my carpets with a broom..Sherry"
1,Don't Buy Anything Geoff Thompson Writes,"This book is horrible. It is double spaced. His sparing partner is wearing sneakers. He makes jokes with gay inuendo that wouldn't be funny even to a gay. The moves are Judo moves. Better to buy Best Judo for Japanese style Judo's quest for takedown points and nothing else, or Gene Labelle's Handbook of Jude, which is inexpensive, has 50's style photography, but is an outstanding all around Judo text. Jeoff Thompson is nothing more than a thug that is a legend in his own mind."
4,"Very good interpretations, brass not strong enough","The conductor here is about unknown as they come. But remember this is the Naxos budget label. You cannot get much cheaper.The first symphony gets a really beautiful reading with an especially thoughtful and charming finale. The Rhenish is a little too fast for my taste but still more than satisfactory. Unfortunately, the all important brass parts in the Rhenish are not nearly as loud and penetrating as they should be. But for 74 cents plus the shipping charge, it is well worth it."
4,Norpro KRONA Juicer Steamer,"I was already familiar with juicer-steamers when I went looking for my own. This one is easy to clean and care for being stainless. The larger pan at the bottom means less chance of cooking off all the water. The glass lid makes it easy to check your progress on the fruit. The only downside is that the hose connection is mounted higher on this juicer than other models. It will retain a little more than a quart of juice below the hose which just means that you have tip it to get all the juice out after each batch. Not a big deal, but the first time you use it you think you aren't getting very much juice. I rate it a 4 only due to the hose positioning. Great product."
1,Poor quality do not buy,This unit looks bullet proof in the photos but it is not. The handles are welded on not riveted and the pieces do not fit together well to the point that the whole unit is unstable. Don't waste your time. When dealing with scalding hot liquids stability is a must. Very dangerous.
1,DO NOT BUY! Safety issues,"I've used my mother's juicer for years, an old aluminum banged up thing. It worked great but she lost it. I was so excited about this beautiful sturdy juicer. I absolutely love the glass lid that makes it so easy to check the grapes progress without losing steam. It has a pan for water that makes it nearly impossible to boil dry.But it has 2 problems and the second problem is a deal breaker. One is that the juicer basket on top holds enough grapes to make 5 quart jars of grapes but the bottom only holds enough juice for about 4 quart jars but you have to be very careful not to let the center section overflow, a pain when you make 50-100 jars of juice like I do. But the deal breaker is this juicer's spout is so high you can only get 1 3/4 quarts of juice out of it before you have to tip the whole unit forward to get the last 2 1/4 quarts out. That is just dangerous, especially for one person. I gave it one star for safety."
5,Norpro KRONA Juicer,"Not many people know about this method of food processing, but I love it....produces a super clear juice when used with fruits and cuts processing time/effort in half."
4,Only one small complaint,This is a handy steam juicer. Large lower pot that makes a good stock pot for soups or stews. The upper basket is large and will also fit in the lower pot to use as a blancher or steamer. My one complaint is the drain tube's design does not allow complete draining of the juice in the capture pot.The glass cover allows for observing progress without opening the lid. The LARGE lower pot means less chance of it boiling dry. (A couple of marbles in the bottom can assist in knowing when it is getting low). The bar loop type handles are easy to grab with mitts on. It appears to be well made and it has been in use the last few weeks even though my canning has been in an RV. It just fits under the stove hood.
5,"Very Nice, Nothing to dislike about it.",The steamer met all my expectations and more. I haven't gotten my grapes yet to juice for this year but in the mean time have been using it to steam other items and it is wonderful. The capacity of the steamer is large enough to do large quantities and the water compartment doesn't run dry.
2,Works ok,Received our first steamer two weeks ago. The spout where the juice comes out was bent just a little and when we filled it with water it leaked. It is not welded just press fit. We returned that one and received a new one in the mail in a week. We juiced crabapples and it worked ok. The spot where the juice comes out is high on the side of the pan it means to get all the juice out you have to lift it and tip it which is tough since it does not fit together very well.Of course amazon is great and easy to use. The return was quick.
5,Norpro Steam Juicer,Had great service and got my steam juicer in no time flat. I have used it several times already and love it. Very good quality and easy as pie to use.
3,Slippery!!,"Bought this for use with my MSR pocket Rocket. Nice little set but it is very slippery. If the stove is not exactly level,the pot wants to slip off. You need to be careful stiring also. Ended up buying a pot with ridges on the bottom. The Pocket rocket can grab it better."
2,Not great,"The material is extremely thin, and the sizing is completely off. I can't even wear them, because they're too huge, and even if they were smaller, the fit is very strange. I wouldn't recommend these at all."
2,Not as pictured,"I ordered the red cargo pants thinking that they were plain only to find that they have the rediculous embroidered gas mask on them approx 8"" in size. I verified that all the pictures that this item has does not show this logo."
4,"""A Disco Classic""","I just bought this CD and it was well worth the money I spent. I must have played it over 30 times before I stopped. Jeffrey Osbourne always breathed life into every song they did. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because I wish they had done more things together as a group. The pulsating beats that the band dished out behind Jeffrey's voice was a match made in heaven. I really relate when he say's ""What we have is much more than they can see."" Jeffrey was and still is my king of Love Ballards."
3,Two Words LOVE BALLET !,"Love ballad till this day is in my top five songs of all time!.Jeff osborne took that song and made it his own,just think about it when you hear love ballad there are no background vocals at all in that song people hear it and don,t realize that.Thats how strong his voice is.The song let the music keep playing is another classic that is timeless but as for the rest of this cd it is just that the rest.overall worth a buy enjoy!"
4,We will never know the truth but,I think the critics of this book are way off. I am a devoted Elvis fan and has been since I first heard his music in the early Seventies.I first read this book about 26 years ago and I remember thinkong that this book was really written out of love. I don't find it judgemental at all. It is a great book in my view.
1,"OUT OF A JOB, OUT OF A FRIEND","THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF HALF-TRUTH BOOKS WRITTENBY DISGRUNTLED EX-EMPLOYEES. THIS TYPE OF GARBAGEAPPEALS TO OTHERS WHO STILL ENVY ELVIS' POPULARITYAND TALENT.THE IRONIC THING IS THE CLAIMS OF ELVIS'DRUG USE WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO ONE OF THE AUTHORSGETTING ARRESTED FOR COCAINE A FEW YEARS LATER!THE SAD PART IS THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS WILL NEVER GETTO SEE AN ELVIS CONCERT LIVE,AND IS CURSED TO STRAINSOF MUSIC BY NO TALENT ""ARTISTS"" AND LOUSY ELVIS BIOGRAHIES!"
1,Fire hazard,"Got this snoot, put it on my strobe and within five-ten minutes it started to smoke and get soft. So if your looking for a snoot, and a good price this is not the one. This unit can't handle the heat."
2,cheap workmanship,"I prefer waiter-style corkscrews like this one because once you get the hang of using them they're simple, effective tools, much like a chef's knife. However, this particular corkscrew is very cheaply made: by the time I'd opened a couple of dozen bottles the hinge of the metal lever thingie (I'm sure the French have a word for it, but I confess my ignorance) became loose, so the lever flops open. It will still open a bottle, but it won't stay closed."
4,Wine Cork corkscrew,"This little guy is compact, handy and easy to use. Great for traveling as it slips in the suitcase, takes up hardly any room and is easy to find. I like the electric openers but this is a good one to have around."
1,Smart people don't buy this item,I've been working like a bartender. I bougth this Corkscrew because it was the expensive one in the wine store. Doesn't works. It's sliding down from the edge of the bottles and the screw it's really thick so it's very hard to screw into the cork. I almost cut my hand with the knife cause the materials dont let you grab properly the Corkscrew.
1,"Cute, but broken",The knife on this came off while I was at a table serving a 100 dollar bottle. Not pleased.
1,Why so much money?,"Over $200 for the discontinued Ni-Cad saw and tool only? Who buys from this overpriced vendor, should be around $60. Costco had this complete saw package with one 18V Ni-Cad battery, charger and case for under $100 a while ago.I have this cordless and the Super Sawall, both are very nice but a bid heavy."
2,This is NOT a Sawzall!,"Nobody every asks for a ""reciprocating construction saw"" -- they ask for a Sawzall. Neglecting the fact that it's a much more convenient term, you have to realize that the Milwaukee name has been synonymous with these tools for longer than I want to admit knowing about them, and I've *never* used one in a situation where the convenience of cordless operation would outweigh the need for a REAL power tool. Get aSawzall, or if 11 amps isn't good enough the 13-ampSuper Sawzall. They're famous for a reason. Cheaper too."
3,It is ok,It is a ok book . not for the advance Christian who is looking for something deep.Good book for a sunday sermon though.
4,A Must Read book,"I read this book in 1986 and just pulled it out again. It should be read or studied by women's groups every where. While it may not seem 'deep' to some, the way we talk is at the heart of many, many church and family relationship problems today. In that sense our words truly due carry the power to hurt or to heal. While it is written with women in mind men would also benefit.I think it should be reprinted in mass!!!!"
4,"Re: Words that hurt, words that heal",It was a beautiful material. I have read other books by same author so I was not surprised at the quality of the book.
1,wrong item in package,well like the last guy said- right package but the wrong part. got a sweeper nozzle instead! they did take it back.
4,Good value!,"Simple watch for a runner. Good design, easy to use, nice display, great value. I am happy with it.Thanks!"
4,Ironman watch,The watch does what it is supposed to. I wish it had a regular timer also. My mistake not reading all the specs before purchasing.
1,Beware of the nickel for those with allergies!,"I have worn timex watches before but I always got the less-than-20-dollars kind because I'm not that avid of a runner. However, I thought it would help to get a bigger display and a split button, so I bought this watch. In less than a week, I had a huge rash on my wrist. Brought up my old nickel allergy. They should put more information about the metal composition in the description."
4,Durable and nice looking,I have always like the Ironman series. This one has great features such as a new Indiglo. The colors look sharp and the strap is durable.
4,Great Buy,This watch is a great value for a runner or anyone who needs to time their activities. The screen is clear and easy to read. While the buttons are big enough for big fingers but not to sensitive when you accidentialy bump into something. The strap is the ruberized version not the velcro strap. I highly reccommed it for the price $35.
4,Timex watch review,"The product is perfect for anyone who wants to have a good quality sports watch.It has an intuitive interface, it's easier to use than most sports watches and the Timex indiglo back light looks just great."
2,Cheap plastic/paint,"I like the function of the watch. The time, date and day of week are prominently displayed and it looks good...at least it did until I went camping this weekend. I got a little bit of bug spray (Deep Woods Off - Sportmans) on the watch and the band has blotches on it that wont come off and the silver paint has flaked off. I've owned it a grand total of three months."
2,"No Flix Indiglo System, No deep yellow Indiglo night-light","The product description above states that the watch ""features a deep yellow Indiglo night-light as well as the hands-free Flix Indiglo activation system.""The watch does not have a deep yellow Indiglo night-light. This watch also does not have the Flix Indiglo activation system.This product description is not correct. It is misleading."
3,Good value,This watch is good for those who want to do High Intensity Interval Training. The count down timer is very useful and the watch is easy to operate.
5,Watch purchase,My husband wanted this for Christmas because he has had the Casio Ironman Watch before and it is a great watch.
4,A Trip Into Terrifying Territory...,"Okay imagine this plot line for a movie... A couple of guys find a beat up old black box buried in their backyard. They bring it inside to investigate... They finally manage to pry the box open, and disturbingly get absorbed into the box.From there they enter a nightmarish world full of evil and unknown. They are trying to escape the black box.Now this CD, is the very soundtrack to such a story. The Black Box Aesthetic from Wilt, is a masterpiece. James is a evil genius. Some other releases from him with dark stories to tell are:As Giants Watch Over Us (a dark version of jack and the bean stalk)Wither (getting lost out in a abandoned farm in the middle of nowhere)Radio 1940 (waking up in the 1940s out in the country... ok so maybe the concept isnt that scary!)"
2,For Victorian era writers only,"The title should have been ""A Writer's Guide to Everyday Life in Victorian England"". While there is a wealth of information on Victorian era customs and daily life, there is very little on the Regency period. Even when the book makes general statements these statements are often applicable only to the Victorian era. As a Regency writer myself, I would caution other writers not to rely on this book for Regency period information.There were great differences between the Regency and Victorian eras, obvious differences such as changes in fashion, or the rapid industrializiation, and more subtle differences such as transformations in public and private behavior.Recommended for Victorian authors, but for Regency authors you would be better served to seek out a copy of ""The Regency Companion"" by Laudermilk & Hamlin."
2,I 'VE READ BETTER,"Very poorly organized and researched. Subject matter was presented disjointed and incomplete. Too many passages were simply exerpted from other sources and pasted in wherever the author felt like it, and jumped about with no logical flow. I feel Daniel Poole's book What Jane Austin ate and Charles Dickens Knew was a much superior work. In fact I bought this book hoping to supplement what I had read in Daniel Pool's book, but it gave me no new insights."
1,Not up to quality of its peers,"This work is structured more like a history book with various topics of life. A major flaw, it lacks a glossary of period terms and expressions. While there are many interesting and amusing quotes and anedotes cited, as a whole it seems to like the style and flair of ""What Jane Austen ATe and Charles Dickens Knew"" by Daniel Pool. Its basic emphasis on giving you a historical account of facets of the period rather than a true insight as to what life was like."
2,Emphsis is on Victorian not Regency life,"My major area of interest is the Regency period and this book, though well written and researched, does not include much about the Regency period. It is full of interesting facts after about 1835, but there is not much information about life, marriage, transportation, ""cant"" or dress before the 1830's."
3,"Not an SACD, as advertised, but worth the cheap price, sort of.","Although this was NOT an SACD, as usual, it was an interesting trip down memory lane and the price was right. But, one trip down memory lane was enough, so I mailed it to a friend who's STILL stuck in the 60's! He loved it! Groovy!"
1,IRRESPONSIBLE JOURNALISM,This book is politically-motivated and does not even attempt to achieve balance. Any sincere truth-seeker searching for an honest appraisal of the situation would do better reading Alan Dershowitz's ( a famous leftist ) THE CASE FOR ISRAEL.
2,Otra vez falla la musicalizacion!,"He comprado varias telenovelas en DVD (ya que las colecciono). Por desgracia, no puedo soportar a la mayoria ya que las han arruinado con la musica que han usado para cubrir la original. Para mi, eso arruina la telenovela por completo. Ya sea porque no tienen las pistas originales, o porque no pueden remasterizar el original para separar el dialogo, o no quieren pagar derechos... Es increible que Televisa, una de las companias mas grandes del MUNDO no pueda invertir en presentar sus colleciones de una manera que respete a la obra original."
5,El Derecho de Nacer,"This is a wonderful novela (story) which depicts that skin color does not make a difference when it comes to loving someone. It also shows how giving great importance to class can ruin more than one life. This movie is an old story, with an ongoing theme; it is sad but with a happpy moral ending. I recommend it because I do not get tire of watching it, and know many people who have said that it is one of the best novelas ever. It was a movie first, because I saw it when I was a child, in black and white, and always wanted to see it again and have my children see it also."
3,El derecho de nacer (The right to be born),"I don't think there is a great deal to say. Most of these 'telenovelas' are quite similar, rather formulae. I only bought it for my mother to have something to watch in Spanish .On the other hand, it's an interesting and well acted story that keeps the viewer wanting to see what happens next.However, we found that the way the mother loses her child, the maid raising him and the mother entering a convent without much drama, was a bit too much to expect viewers to believe. What mother wouldn't do the utmost to try to find her child?The first scenes, where the young woman's parents act very harshly with her on finding out about her pregnancy, seem too melodramatic on the young woman's part. It becomes rather annoying as these scenes are quite long too.Finally, and this is an unfortunate feature of many Latin telenovelas, the background music is too loud throughout often drowning the characters' dialogue."
4,About El derecho de nacer,"El derecho de nacer has very good actors, that I have seen before in previous novelas and the subject is very good put"
4,El direcho de nacer,"This was a very good soap opera. I bought this, however I had watched it when it was on tv in the 80's and loved it when I saw it."
5,Essential Piece of Bad Religion History,"The performance is raw and edgy, the song selection is outstanding (they have so many great songs that I couldn't imagine a poorly written setlist), and its affordably-priced. I highly recommend this DVD to any Bad Religion fan!"
3,We're only gonna die... from our own arrogance,"OK I'm a 30 year old Bad Religion fan, and can relate to Greg's interview when he talks about the older crowd at the shows. This DVD rocks, simply put. It's pure Bad Religion during their peak! Lots of good live footage of low-key venues. Some insightful interviews with the band members. Audio is great quality. At first I was dissappointed with the clips from different shows pasted together for each song. But reviewing the DVD soon set me straight - it still rocks. Any true BR fan will love this one."
4,What's old is new again...,"""Along The Way"" captures Bad Religion as the band began entering its peak, off the ""Suffer"" tour. The setlist features the band's forgotten brutality, with a large portion coming off ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse?"" The interviews with the German voice coming from off screen are unintentionally hillarious, but cover a variety of material including drug addiction and Nintendo.The source material is great. But the DVD is a disappointment. No special features, no photos, nothing but a bare bones menu list. Epitaph should have came to the plate on this one with a bit more authority. But at least the company isn't overcharging at a $14 pricetag.Even so, I'll treasure the DVD, which replaces my VHS copy and it's grainy images and crackling audio. Dolby sound encoding would have been nice, but it's Bad Religion, and do you really need that? probably not.A MUST for Bad Religion fans."
3,If you are addicted to Bad Religion...,"If you are addicted to Bad Religion, you need this dvd. It gives a great look at what their shows were like in the late 1980's. It is well recorded and includes their best songs from ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse"", ""Back To The Known"", and ""Suffer"". Many of these songs aren't played live anymore. However, Bad Religion recorded many incredible records after Suffer and you won't find a single one of those songs included on this DVD. Unless you are only into Bad Religions early music or you can't get enough of the band, the 2006 DVD ""Live at the Palladium"" is a much more complete representation of the band's like show."
4,Great trivia source for the movie buff,"This book is amazing. Its got stuff about movies that you never knew about. Like the longest movies names, the weirdest movie names. It does miss on some importatnt movie trivia that have appeared in other books like the Guiness book of records. However it is a great book to have on your shelf if you want to astound your friends with your trivia knowledge about movies."
2,Clips that fasten down kitchen sink,"These clips did not work as well as I wanted them to. They (clips) aligned the sink ok with the counter top,but would not tighten the sink down as tight as I wanted the clips to."
3,"Duck vs Baby Pitbull = 16 days, One Dead Duck","The toy looked cool. The feet were the first to go. Soon after, Mr. Duck lost it's beak. By about day 10 Mr. Duck couldn't quack to save his stuffing, his quacker had been gutted. By that time it was too late. A few days later we found Mr. Duck with his stuffing on the floor. Poor Mr. Duck. Bubba, our dog, really did like Mr. Duck though. It was a good relationship that Bubba and Mr. Duck had, but like so many relationships that take off quickly, it ended quickly with broken hearts and Bubba pooping cotton for three days."
3,Liked it but didn't last,"My dog loved this toy... so much that in about a month he had ripped it apart and torn the squeaker and stuffing out of it. Even with the suffing emptied out, he contiunes to play with it and carry it around the house."
3,"Great fuzziness but ""quacker"" gave out!","My Boston Terrier absolutely LOVED this toy...for about 20 minutes until the ""quack"" sound stopped working. I cant believe it already stopped working! Great sound and fuzzy, lifelike feel but for some reason my sound didnt last long!"
2,Quacker lasted 10 minutes,"This duck was hilarious! Quack was a riot. My dog loved it. Just kept chewing and making it quack. Then the quack quit. After about 10 minutes. That ended his fun with the duck. This is the second stuffed ""tuff stuff"" toy from Hartz that we bought that didn't last. The squeakers go then my dog wants nothing to do with them. I can't believe most other's duck is lasting."
4,Great Toy for a Usually Destructive Dog,"My dog loves these ducks. He got his 2nd one for Christmas this year. My dog is known to destroy anything with a squeaker and stuffing within seconds. Not this duck! He lasts weeks before getting destroyed (sorry, he isn't completely indestructible). Even after the stuffing and squeaker have been removed, my pup will play with the remaining body of the duck for hours. One of the best qualities of this toy is the squeaker. Instead of the usual sounds, this squeaker honks almost like a real duck. It drives our dog crazy while playing with it!"
3,The quack feature went out...,"My dog got this for Christmas, and she loved it. The quack of the toy ceased almost immediately. It was cute, she loved it, now plays with it sadly. She loves toys that make noise, and all of her other things are still squeaking, etc."
4,Very durable but squeaker never worked,"I'm quite amazed at how durable this toy has been. My Golden Retriever totally destroyed a large neoprene duck that I had purchased elsewhere in less than an hour. This thing still looks as good as new and he's been trying to destroy it for a month now. The only thing he's managed to accomplish is chew the tag off and pull out a very small amount of the ""fur"" on this toy. If the squeaker hadn't been DOA I would give this thing 5 stars but I've deducted 1 star because the squeaker was broken on arrival. The broken squeaker is probably just a fluke but I wanted to mention it."
3,Cute but no cigar!,"While this duck is pretty cute maybe it's meant for hunting dogs? But our 2.5 year old German Shepherd had all the stuffing out of this thing within a day. She still plays with the lifeless duck, sans stuffing of course. So if your dog doesn't rip up toys this is probably a good purchase for you."
2,not like the old ones,"I have bought the AKC Mallard toys for my labs in the past. It looks the same, but is not the same quality. Disappointed."
3,No quack for my newfie,I have a newfie that first demos all the squeakers then chews the stuffing out of all her toys. This one however wouldn't quack so she had very little interest.
5,Dog toy,I have bought many of this toy. My dog tears them apart. They are not very durable but I like the squeaker its a honk like a goose rather than a squeak. Easy to throw and soft.
3,DEAD DUCK IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES,"My dog absolutely loves her ducks, but she can dismantle one in 5 minutes or less. That is, a hole big enough for her to get the 'quacker' out and chew it into bits. Then comes the stuffing... She sure enjoys pulling the stuffing out. I used to try to put the stuffing back in and sew it up, but that was a lost cause. Now I buy the model that comes minus the stuffing and the plastic 'quacker'. She still loves that duck, and I still find the bits she chews off - beak, toes, wings etc. - but it does last longer."
3,AKC Mallard dog toy,"Nicely constructed and life like, but my Westtie pays no attention to it, preferring to play with his many other toys, for some reason. Anyway, maybe your dog will like this. Arrived in good condition and on time."
2,Not For Strong Chewing Young Labs...,"Our female yellow lab is 16 months old and still a very strong chewer. Unfortunately, this line of plush toys is not stitched strongly for safety as stated. Our lab had head off within 2 minutes; and I had to quickly remove stuffing and squeakers so she wouldn't choke on those."
4,Great Item but squeaker didn't Last,I love my duck but I think I killed the squeaker in just a couple of days. But I still play with it all of the time.
2,Lasted less than 48 hours,"In brief, would not purchase again.Between two bird dog mutts that both weigh in under 50 lbs, the quacker was done in an hour, the stuffing was torn out that evening, and by the next evening, the poor mallard was in pieces (after removing the rest of the stuffing). My dogs find bird-shaped toys irresistable so I tried theEthical 5733 Skinneeez Plus - Duck Stuffing-Less Dog Toy, 15-Inchinstead and it seems to be holding up better so far."
2,Good new songs but....,"Look, I love John waite. I've see him in concert when ever he is nearby in Jersey. I went to see him at Great Adventure in the pouring rain when there were only FIVE people there, and when he toured with Journey. I love his music.But this album is a dissapointment. Not the music mind you, the album. The new/cover/remake songs are great,wonderful, can't say enough about them. But what's up with the 5 songs from Figure in a Landscape?!!? I don't get it. There is absolutely no need for these songs here. Those that are going to buy this album, I am sure, already own Landscape.I would have prefered John stay in the studio, even if it took another year or so, and produce a FULL album of all new songs. Or at the very least, release the new songs on a small album at a lesser price."
4,Rereleased,"5 of the songs on this CD are from John Waite, Figure in a Landscape, which is an excellent poppy album. If this album was promoted properly, I'm sure most of these songs would be hits."
4,"Great Power, Control & Ergonomics.","I hate to see good or even great products get lousy reviews because of incorrect application or ""bad"" vendor/Amazon/""customer service"" issue, sooo here goes.Milwaukee Sawzalls are the the premiere reciprocating saws on the market, that said, this one is no different, however, you won't be making tough repeated cuts w/ this saw, it's corded counterpart, or the other smaller corded sawzalls for that matter (3/4"" stroke length). This tool accepts 18v NiCad and V18 LiIon battery types, both battery types attach forward or backward. It has orbital and direct cutting actions, furthering an already versatile tool's, utility. This saw is excellent for the serious weekend warrior, ""mid-range"" Pro-level work or landscaping applications. For heavy demo, framing, cutting etc. Milwaukee V28 Sawzall & 12+ Amp. corded versions are in order (1-1/8"" stroke length). The Hatchet is also highly ergonomic in it's pivoting handle design."
2,Nice as long as it lasts,"I bought my hatchet brand new about a year and a half ago, largely because of Milwaukee's 5 year warranty, and reputation. It worked great for light duty odds and ends, and tight spaces up until a few weeks ago when the gearbox or something in the drive system failed entirely. The motor still runs, but the blade no longer moves. I've yet to see if Milwaukee will stand behind it, the last time I send something in for electrical work under warranty they claimed it wasn't their problem."
2,"very useful design, terrible motor","I loved the compact, flexible design-- my plumber sub borrowed it to saw a pipe that he thought would be impossible. Unfortunately, the Hatchet only came with one battery, which seemed to constantly be dead right when I really needed it (on a roof, 40 feet up, with no extension cord). So I bought another battery, which cost another $100 at Home Depot, and the stupid motor died. I had owned it for a year-and-a-half, so no warranty, even though I had used it fairly infrequently for most of that time (due to the constantly-dead single battery). So I was stuck with 2 batteries and a crapped-out tool. Useless."
5,The Hatchet,"I am impressed with this sawzall. I was looking for a sawzall for my shop and I decided to buy a good one. I had no idea that the adjustable handle was going to be so useful. This thing is awesome. It will cut anything, and quickly to boot. You can get at just about anything With the adjustable handle. If your looking for a top of the line sawzall with lots of features, this is it."
3,Not quite up to par,"Like his corded brother this saw is top notch as far as the mechanical aspects go. There is a definate problem though with the batteries. They do not stay charged for very long, and unfortunately for me I purchaced before I read the reviews of other customers explaining that the batteries are only good for about a year. Hopefully Milwaukee will design a better system soon."
3,Milwuakee 18v Hatchet,"I have used Milwaukee sawzalls for years, but decided I want to also carry a cordless in my truck. Bought this one, loved the 90 degree handle, but I was only able to do about 8 long cuts on a kitchen cabinet demo before the battery died. Other reviews had warned about the stock battery being poor and that is correct. I am now going to look for a decent deal on the Lithum Ion battery."
5,don't pass this one by,"Are you in a healthy relationship? Does the sound of your man's key in your front door make you happy or aprehensive? Do you keep ending up with the same types of dawgs over and over again? If you answered yes to any of these questions read Dr. Cornish's book. In an affectionate, down to earth way she shows women of color that they don't have to settle for second best in their relationships. This book, if you really read it could save your life.Kimberley Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should've Told You About Men."
4,This just in........,"Just got this generator today. I bought this unit because of the high surge wattage rating figuring that I could hook my 15A compressor up to it.Solid unit with easy start engine, 1 pull was all it took after taking it out of the box and filling it with oil and gas. Did some initial testing and set the idle control to ON and plugged in a 3/8 drill and power was immediately there when I pulled the trigger on the drill. Unplugged the drill and plugged in my Porter-Cable 3HP/4Gal double stack 135psi compressor. Turned on the compressor and it tripped the GFCI breaker in about 2 seconds. This compressor NEVER trips the 15A circuit in my house that I usually have it plugged into. However, according to the manual, they recommend turning off the idle control when powering large motors. So I flipped the idle off and turned the compressor back on and away I went with no tripped breaker. So much for getting those 9000 surge watts from idle. Noise from the generator was tolerable...."
3,Interesting but lacks depth,"This is a disappointing book. It is full of hundreds of little snapshots of events, each crying out for greater context and explanation, neither of which is provided. It is also top-heavy with the high politics of Washington, and thus doesn't really keep its promise of giving a panoramic view of the nation's life in 1964. It's interesting but ultimately reads a bit like a script for a not too intellectually taxing TV documentary."
3,Outdoor fountain,The item is adequate. I feel the price was a bit high for what you get. It was easy to assemble.
5,Wonderful book for those composing their own ceremony,"This was the perfect book for me. We borrowed parts of the sample ceremonies to create our own wedding ceremony. The sample ceremonies we used include a Zen Buddhist and a Zen/Unitarian/Humanist wedding which I could not find anywhere else. The Buddhist influence was apparent throughout the book.Many of the readings were quite wonderful and spiritual. I say spiritual and not religious, since many of the writings appeared to be appropriate for any faith."
4,A Wonderful Anthology for the Interfaith or Intercultural Wedding,"There are many collections of writings out there today which can be used in wedding ceremonies, or in related activities like writing an invitation.As a practicing interfaith minister, what makes this anthology so special to me is the diversity of sources for the material. It includes writings of everyone from Emily Dickinson, Maria Rilke, and the Christian Bible, to those of Seng-Ts'an, RUMI, and Parancoti Munivar. This is truly a unique gathering of words and philosophies for anyone involved in preparing a wedding ceremony!"
2,Not comprehensive enough. No contemporary poems.,The book is a decent resource if you are looking for classic poetry to be read by the officiant or ideas for a toast. I was seeking a romantic poem for a bride to read the groom. The language was dated in many of the selections. Some seemed plain silly. I wish they included contemporary selections.
4,entertaining; quite different from the book,"My own children enjoyed the movie, although it is quite different from the book, with the book being much better, as is usually the case. My class of 5th graders viewed the film as a follow-up to reading the novel in class. (They too, preferred the book.) The two titles on one DVD is a good deal."
4,Shiloh/Shiloh Season,I ordered this movie for my seven year old granddaughter--she loves animals! We watched it together and she hardly moved while it was on. Great family movie.
5,A great way to intro kids to SF & great authors.,"I read this book when I was about 11. I feel in love with Science Fiction because of this book and the writings of Asimov. I also have managed to read every Heinlein book written, because this one was so wonderful. I now give a copy to my kids when they reach about 9 years old. My youngest son who just turned 10 is in the middle of it now and is enjoying it as much as I did. It's a cute story with an interesting story line and surprise ending. I would also recommend it to adults as a fun read. Give it to a child that has begun reading. It would make a great kids movie. Give it to an adult that needs a break from Real Life."
4,"The Star Beast is a charming, sensitive look at ourselves","The Star Beast is a delightful look at the different perspectives vastly different psychologies can have while telling a very entertaining story. While appropriate for children (and, indeed written for them in the Fifties), The Star Beast is sure to cause a wry chuckle in any adult. I recommend it."
4,One of the better Heinlein juveniles,"This is another Heinlein juvenile, though I've read this one before (probably repeatedly). Fond memories made me decide to tackle it last night, when I had a headache.Lummox is a strange, large beast that John Thomas Stuart's grandfather brought back from a distant planet. Lummox can and does terrorize the local town without really trying whenever he escapes. The most recent event kicks off this story, leading to a push to destroy or at least expell Lummox. Meanwhile, the government agency responsible for aliens is called in and has to deal with the situation. They eventually find that Lummox is a valued member of a mysterious and powerful alien race. Politics ensues (something I hadn't remembered much of), with many twists and turns and attempts to take advantage of the situation without getting the planet blown up. It all of course turns out well, but not without effort."
4,"it's cute, it's fun, you won't regret reading it","if you think that this is a children's book, then you have most likely lost your sense to enjoy a story that is, well, cute. Following Lummox, a cuddly unearthly dinosaur like star beast with a kiddie's mind on his adventures through ""strange"" earth society - you won't regret that reading. Sort of like ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", but without the cynicism"
5,Blugeoning humor that beats your brains in!!!,"I'm telling you Red Meat comics are the most sick, twisted, disgusting, and preverse cartoons you'll ever lay eyes on and that means naturally I think their great. I laughed so hard I thought I'd piss my pants. The poltically incorrect humor had me thinking ""this is just F'ing wrong"" while I had to catch my breath. Its so different from anything out there and the comic humor isn't ""Beetle Bailey or Peanuts"" type humor to put you to sleep. This humor doesn't tap you on the shoulder it bludgeons your head till your brains spill out. Get this piece of garbage it is gold and you'll be a better person because laughing is what makes you that way."
5,a story and a url,"I ordered my copy from Max Cannon. I received this reply: ""Dear Harrison, Thanks for supporting RED MEAT ... each purchase keeps me out of the restaurant industry for another day. Oddly enough, Max Cannon."" Nice touch."
5,I've never laughed so hard at a comic strip,When I first saw Bug-eyed Earl staring at me from the cover I had to check out what Red Meat was all about. I've never laughed so hard at the printed word in my life. It's often dark and subversive stuff and it's endlessly clever. I'm now addicted to Red Meat.
1,"Problems, but no help from Lexmark","The LCD screen failed, and Lexmark gave us an estimate of >$800 to repair it! I took a chance and ordered a replacement ""operator panel"" for $75 from Lake Erie Systems, and figured out how to replace it myself in 10 min. I got lucky, that was all it needed but Lexmark was no help at all. Their absolute lack of concern for their customers is probably industry standard, but I'll give another manufacturer a chance next time."
1,Toner fog on every page,"This printer works great out of the box, but once you've printed a few hundred pages, every page will contain a light gray background (toner fog). The only solution to this problem -- Lexmark customer support, with whom I have become VERY INTIMATE since purchasing this printer, has provided NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE -- is to purchase a new toner cartridge, which costs, at minimum, $89. This is what I did -- and guess what? After a few hundred pages with the new cartridge, toner fog on every page again.BUYERS BEWARE: I am not the only person to have experienced this problem with the C530DN. Customers at CNET reviews have complained of the same. This problem would appear to be a DESIGN FLAW with the printer. Clean black-and-white print-outs with this printer will cost you nearly 30 cents apiece.Avoid this printer!!!"
2,Beautiful job - but HUGE printing costs!!!,"I have owned this printer for all of 3500 pages, 95% of them normal text on normal paper. In that time I have gone through *2* black cartridges (nominally rated for 4000 pages EACH), and these suckers, at $100 or so, are NOT cheap. I also own a Dell 3100CN, and whatever its other faults, printing the same load it gets 30% MORE than the nominal capacity. My Dell may cost a penny or two per page. The Lexmark is a hefty multiple.Otherwise, it is a superb printer. It prints beautifully, handles different papers with ease, and has a fantastic and easy to use menu system. It also integrated with my network with no problem whatsoever. In terms of quality and speed this is the best printer I have ever seen. Bar NONE.But unless you do not care about your money, don't buy this printer. Heck, at this rate, even ink-jets look cost-effective. Lexmark clearly are taking advantage of their customers."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,Please do not buy this printer. I can't tell you how disappointed you will be. We bought 4 of these printers and I regret the day that we chose them. Out of the box it seems like a great printer. The first photos we printed were great. However we have gone through thousands of dollars of toner cartridges in a year and a half. And setting everyone to just print black and white did not help - we are still loosing toner in the color cartridges as well. Now we are having problems finding the door rollers and other supplies which will cost us quite a bit to replace on each one. This is an awful deal - do not buy.
2,Very noisy fan.,"I was attracted to the Lexmark by the cost. However, you get what you pay for. After printing anything over about 6 pages, after the job finishes, a very loud fan turns on in the back of the printer, and stays on for 6 minutes! I called Lexmark, and they said this was normal! If you want a quiet printer, avoid this printer."
4,A practical and useful book,"This book is great. The title can be a little misleading. The book is about behaviors you can adopt to influence things to go the way you want them to. It's not a new age hocus pocus book. It is a real world street smart book on a variety of ways to influence people and situations to go well for you.There are a lot of suggestions on improving your luck in addition to the seven main methods that the author lists in the table of contents. Some of it is commonsense, but sometimes we need a reminder. Some of the advice is immeadiately applicable. Get this book!!"
1,Don't buy this!,"I just downloaded this at a bargain price of $3.69 without comparing tracks to a music reference site. This download is really ""Our Most Dangerous Stunts"" an album rated as one star by All Music Guide because the tracks are not the originals but re-recorded versions from 2006. AMG describes this set as ""This is a must-avoid at all costs"". I agree. I've been duped by Amazon on this one despite the fact that I buy a lot of music. Don't you be duped, too."
5,Get this album!,"One of the best albums to come out of the '70s (rock music's best decade). If you've never heard this album, you don't know what you are missing. Buy this CD today. You will not regret it!"
5,Do the Hokey Pokey!,"The students I work with, my classmates, my supervisor/director, and I all love this toy. I usually set it up on an end table in the center and the kids and I do the hokey pokey!"
1,Can't Install,I have a new hp Pavilion Windows 7 and I can't install the program you sent me. Is it necessary for me to have the original Millionaire game in order to install the 3rd edition?
1,who wants to be a milionaire 3rd edition,"after installing and playing this disk, it get hung up all the time, ie. it will get to a certain place and repeate the same thing over and over for at lest 6 or 7 times then finally click ove to the next question i wold return this but it would cost more to return than just keep it"
3,"Some Fun, Lacks Some Features, Requirements","If you like the game show now hosted on tv without Regis you will like playing this game.+ Plus +1. You can download more questions through Disney.2. The best version available for the PC.- Minus -1. Requires Quicktime to run the game but you can always optto install Quicktime Alternative instead of the bloatedQuicktime from Apple.com.2. Can't register through the software (probably since Disneytook over). I couldn't even get my browser to pop-up.3. Can't use fastest finger if you are going solo and thechoices for your phone a friend is automatically selected foryou unlike the show where you can choose (or at least itseems so) who to call.- Summary -These are just a few of the minor glitches I have noticed.I didn't check if you could disable the sound if you get tiredof hearing Regis talk back at you or not. Overall, just an averagefun game with nothing to rave about."
3,ok game,"I think I speak for everyone when I say ""thank goodness the millionaire phenomenon is over with"". Even though it's been over with for about 5 years now, for some reason, the video games are still somewhat popular. No reason for it. Let the games end, and let the show be just a memory. Hey, I have nothing against this game (it's pretty good, but the questions are challenging) I just think overexposing Regis played a big part in bringing the Millionaire craze to a sudden end. Buy the game if you're smart."
3,Mediocre game,"Millionaire 3rd edition is fun and challenging, but some stuff bugs me in this game. but first the pro'sPro'sLots of questions and very challengingRegis is always funnyThe sounds make the game because you can be at the $32,000 level and feel nervous during the time they make you wait until you have gotten it right or not. The soundtrack makes it dramaticCon'sThe fatest finger. If you get it wrong many times, Regis leaves and the game starts over.The stupid phone a friend sucks. Although the start questions the phone a friend helps, in the later parts of the game, it is useless. Regis called this dufus and he had a fire, and hung up. Regis said ""That wasn't much help"". What an idiot. The friend did not even attempt to answer the question. Shame on Buena Vista interactive.This game is lots of fun and should be bought. But some of the other features like the lifelines will drive you insane."
2,Not great if you fill it with CD's,"If you fill this with CD's, it's hard to zip, and alsothe inner sleeves which are individually removable tend tofall out. It's not horrible but if I could buy over againI would choose something else."
2,Why this product is not so good.,"I got this product hoping that I could store 24 cd's. When you put all 24 (or a little less amount) in the case, it becomes VERY hard to close and very bulky.It also has the pages which come out. Once you put the cd's in, once you turn the pages, they fall out!Even worse... I cannot fit this product in a case that holds a CD player and Cd's!!Think twice before buying this product."
1,The last review you'll ever have to read,"I'm giving it a one because it looks nice, has a carrying strap, and the rating don't go any lower. It might work well for a few weeks but soon it'll start to get on your nerves. The top and bottom flip seprately which is just stupid. Also the actual sleeves are removable, which is also stupid. Eventually the sleeves will just start to fall out. Don't bother reading the other reviews, just turn back now."
2,what happened?,"Well I love ""Saturate"" so I bought this without even having heard anything off of it. So Cold started the album off great and I had high hopes. Well, there was nothing else on the album nearly as good as So Cold and I was really disappointed. The rest of the album is OK, but it seems like they have tried to make their sound more mainstream and marketable, so yeah I guess I am calling them sellouts. Saturate just plain rocked. This just plain blows in comparison."
5,breath taking albam,they are onw of my fav bands. i first got a taste of there music at the 3 doors down concert and fell in love with ther music. get there albam i know you will love it if you like hard rock.
3,Alright,I mainly bought this for one song that I really liked. The rest of it was ok. I would not buy this again.
4,An interesting story...,"So here I am listening to the radio and hearing ""so cold"" and liking it very much. So I go to best buy to purchase the cd. only 9.99. At first i hated it. sounded like everyone else, only worse. its growing on me though.. songs that sounded terrible at first are now beginning to make sense and click with me. these guys sound alot like new bands in recent memory.. but these guys have enough originality to stand out and probably stay in the game. come to think of it they are from 2002.. so maybe there is hope. hopefully they keep getting better"
4,Cool - but derivative,"All in all a great effort and a hair-thrashin' listen, but am I the only one who thinks these guys sound a lot like Tool and Perfect Circle (Benjamin sounds like he modeled his front on Maynard's vocal stylings) with a slowed-down System Of A Down riff or two thrown in? Don't get me wrong - I really like this album, along with Saturate - but it doesn't hurt to acknowledge your antecendents."
4,An excellent find...,"After hearing the single ""So Cold"" on my local radio station, I fell in love with it. The melody, the lyrics, the pounding music of the chorus. It was all perfect. Thumbs up to an excellent rock album. I buy a lot of cds for just one song. Sometimes the rest of the album is good, as this one is, and other times they are not (as is my case for Switchfoot, but that is another review). Buy it if you love rock!"
4,Very Good,"This CD is somewhat different than most rock, but its still very good. So Cold is what first drew me to this CD, and then i got hooked on other songs like Breakdown, Rain, Firefly. I give it 4 stars because it is very good - but i have still heard some better rock CD's than this"
5,Impressive,"I'm a big fan of Saturate and I've been waiting to see what these guys did next. I heard So Cold when Hellboy came out and I knew these guys would put something great together. The cd might not be as hard as Saturate but it is every bit as good. It was a good decision to open the cd with So Cold, its not hard and its not slow, it just flows from beginning to end and is one of many styles used by the band on We Are Not Alone. Theres the hardness of Believe, the acoustic Rain, and the easy listening Forget It. My favorite songs on the cd are probably Simple Design and Believe. The rest of the cd can appeal to anyone and i would strongly recommend this cd."
3,"A step up, kind of","I rated the band's first album as 3 stars as well, but this album is a better kind of three stars. BB runs into many of the same problems here as they did on their debut; too many sound-alike tracks, minimal variation on guitar sound and quality, and the fact that BB really sounds like they're forcing their toughness. When they slow down on ""Rain Song"", they hit gold; the melody really carries the emotional pull of the song, and we see the band for what they really are. While a number of pounding tracks manage to be good by way of songwriting, I can't help but think they're trying to force themselves into a square when they're actually a circle. They have a more rounded personality that they should really let out more.Overall, it's a step up. They try a couple new things, go for some different moods, and they had Billy Corgan to push them along, so they gets points there too. But the band is plagued by their inability to show what they really are, and the album suffers for it."
2,Misses the mark,"There are a few wonderful songs on this cd. Most of the tracks, however, you'll find yourself bored or annoyed by. It's worth owning for the handful of inspired tracks that do exist here. But I would avoid paying full price."
5,This Cd Rock's,"I just got it today for so cold and follow and the rest of this cd is great, the person that said breaking benjamin is under rated is right, This band is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,We Are Not Alone,"This is a good CD in and of itself, but for those who loved Saturate, I'm afraid it's a little of a letdown. They set the bar so high with their first disc, but it does seem like they are trying to become more mainstream. But who can blame them, it's where the money is. Another reviewer mentioned he felt like crying, and I know the feeling. I felt the same way when Skrape put out their follow up disc. I liked it, but it's nowhere as good as the first disc, and way too mellow."
3,"rockin', but nothing innovative","look dont get me wrong......this is a fairly good album. i would'nt go as far as to say avoid it like anthrax or anything. there are some great heavy riffs and there are some genuine moments of passion on this album. songs like so cold, simple design and follow are good formulaic rock songs with good riffs. however, there is nothing really that innovative about it and its really just generic rock.....you cant categorise it as much else. a lot of songs missed that certain hook you look for in a song and many of the choruses that everyone says are so melodic and passionate......are'nt that different from anything i could hear from most other bands of the genre. try poison the well people if you really crave that. so overall id say its an ok album but nothing groundbreaking and if you ask of me it sounded too much like nickelback to put into my favorite pile. nonetheless i think ill have to try some of the earlier stuff to make sure im not under any misconceptions"
3,We Are Not Alone,"No one ever accused Breaking Benjamin of being original, but the band did offer a fair selection of catchy and melodic hard rock on their debut Saturate. Their follow-up, We Are Not Alone, continues where the last album left off, but this time the band takes a little time to meander in different directions. Tracks like Simple Design, Breakdown, and Believe will please fans of the last album, but others like Forget It and Rain show the band's softer side, while So Cold is a little darker in nature than their usual. In the end though, much of the album is simply following the same plot as Saturate, which is fine for the most part as what is here is enjoyable, but one does wish the band would mix things up a bit. It seems not even a helping hand from Billy Corgan could introduce Breaking Benjamin to variety."
5,Breaking Benjamin just has what you want,"I could fill you with all the reasons this cd is great but i'd rather leave you with one word that sum's it up, remarkable"
2,At least one song is catchy...,"Like a lot of people who've reviewed this CD already, I was lured in by ""So Cold."" The price was right, but it's another case of you get what you pay for. Each song sounds the same, with that mass-produced ""heavy"" sound, save for two or three songs that are a little lighter (which, oddly enough, sound just like one another). If you really like what you heard on the radio and don't mind something unoriginal, get this disc and knock yourself out."
2,I Think we have a bunch of morons reviewing this CD!!!,"This CD is pretty average. The only good songs on the album are:1.So Cold (10/10)3.Follow Me (8/10)7.Sooner or Later (9/10)9.Away (8/10)Worth checking out only for those four songs... Buy it somewhere on eBay, i'm sure you can find it for less than $5 there. BTW, the last song on this CD is a total disaster. So stop giving it 7/10 or more."
3,Sick of it!,"Ok, the radio ruined this band for me. If I ever hear ""So Cold"" again I will just quit listening to the radio all together. This isn't a totally bad album though. It's good the first week you listen to it, then you'll pretty much be done with it. And the way dude sings sometimes is aweful. In the verse to ""So Cold"" he sings like a freakin vampire! You'd think you were listening to Type O Negative. And that's not the only time his vocals get annoying. Like I said, this is one of those albums that is good the first few times you listen to it and then you'll never listen to it again."
5,"Breaking Benjamin, too awesome for a sappy title.","Breaking Benjamin, the second album. In ways it will never match up to the origional, but in otherways it beats it. On a radio station where I live they had Benjamin in studio, and they said that they wanted 'We are not alone' to sound different from the first, and it does. I belive they tried to keep thier rock stlye and do something origional, not a first album sound-a-like.If you liked 'Saturate' buy this one, or how bout` buy it anyway.""Buy or die."""
2,I like them a lot better when they were called Tool,When they went by there old name of Tool they rilly new how to rock. I actulie like some of the songs on this album but Lateralice was alot better. Why did they change there name and get so crappy? Seriously this is some incredibly derivitive corporate rock. Commercial with a capital C so go back and listen to the radio you mindless drones.
1,HA HA HA !,"Oh god right when i heard the first four seconds of the cd i laghed so hard i mearly pissed myself. I judged the band before i heard them like i do with every band and most of the time I am right. That is why i laghed so hard when i first heard this because i knew exactly what it would sound like! Sounds exactly like all the other MTV ""RAWK"" clones. And yes, I did spell rockR-A-W-K. Ha Ha! get it?"
5,Just Awesome,This is definitely a great buy. There is only one song that I don't like on the whole CD...the last one! Grab this!
4,This band is going places!!,"...and I'm fairly sure they're all good places. I just saw them in concert on Wednesday; these guys not only rock hard, they put on a hell of a show for the fans. This album is mos def a more mature album than ""Saturate;"" you can hear it in the music as well as in the lyrics. I like the fact these guys can rock hard without being completely depressed all the time.I'm really looking forward to their next album. I'd like to see them get a bit more complex musically, but all things given, this album is one of the better ones I've bought this year. Check this out, I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed."
5,Wow... all I can say is wow,"Breaking benjamin's debut Saturate was one of those amazing albums that kind of emerged from the bowels of the music industry and became an amazing underground hit. So needless to say that I was on pins and needles waiting for there newest release. Fast forward a little bit. I went out an bought the game Smackdown vs. raw, and the song ""firefly"" pretty much drives the soundtrack of the game. At first listen the song is amazing, but unfortunatly, it didn't take that long to get old. Yet it was good enough that I went out and got We are not alone as soon as I could and I must say that it did not dissapoint in the slightest. From start to finish this is an amazing album, and in fact it is an improvement from the first. I strongly believe that this album is going to be the catalyst for something much bigger for breaking benjamin."
5,breaking benjamin,"man breaking benjamin is really good , plus i like there influences, nirvana , korn , tool. what more can you ask for this album has some of the best songs ive ever heard,, saturate is really good too but i dont think its as blissful as we are not alone. i wish everyone in the world would get this album because this is probably the best thing happening in heavy rock music and just to note this on my oppinion the best song on the album is break my fall, its just a well written song and i wish i were the one who wrote it... id be dead right now from suicide but i got this album two days before i was planning to overdose and the music really helped me get through a rough period in my life,, thank you breaking benjamin."
5,system of a down,"real good. i just wanna point out breaking benjamin copied this same melody they used in ""so cold"" from system of a down in their song ""spiders. ull see. listen to them"
2,only a few decent songs....,"these guys are nothing new really. just a bunch of people who can play guitar and beat a drum who also use an annoying screaming voice in their songs. they do produce a decent song every now and then, but i cant stand the stupid sounding screaming. if they took that crap outta their songs, they might be better."
2,Well... at least it beats Greenday,"The good thing about this is that it is better than most mainstream piles of garbage. While Breaking Benjamin is in no way a ""great"" band, it is okay. Much better than Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and all those no-talent losers who have no right associating themselves with the word ""rock"".However, compared to real rock, in other words, the stuff you WONT hear on MTV every 5 minutes (or ever in fact), this album blows. If you like Green Day and crap like that, maybe buy this as a transition into REAL bands, like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, etc. After all, switching from poser-punk-pop like Green Day straight to Megadeth is a huge jump.If you insist on buying Mainstream crap, I'd say this is some of the better stuff you'll find on MTV. But if you want real music, look elsewhere."
1,Same old canned pseudo-hard-rock bull squeeze,"What an unfortunate waste of $18. This garbage sounds like every other ""hard rock"" band. This album is the result of a bunch of guys who thought The Black Album really rocked. Good thing my little sister still thinks it's heavy..."
1,promotional,"It is unprofessional, if not altogether petty, to review an album I've only heard snippets and snacks from. But as far as 'professional' goes...you'd have to pay me to listen to any more. There are thousands of bands ready and, unfortunately, waiting to replace this one. Radio/mtv endorsement does not always entail an act of terrorism against musical standards, and most 'underground' bands never should have left the garage, but if you think this is the best rock has to offer then please, I'm begging you, keep looking."
2,Korn + System of a Down - Original lyrics = ...,"Breaking Benjamin. When I first heard So Cold, it was yet another tone that I knew I heard before but couldn't quite remember. I realized where it came from a couple days ago when listening to System of a Down. Every song on here follows the same style that Korn came up with over ten years ago, and takes tones and beats perfected by some of the good bands that came from that. A better description of this cd would be The Deftones using a weaker voice and much simpler guitar riffs. There are even moments where he tries to sound like the singer from Tool.The Mix of so many other bands might have almost made this cd sound original, if it wasn't for new cd's by the Deftones and Korn comming out within a year of this one.Sorry Breaking Bemjamin, but you guys are about five years too late to be original, and four years too late to be worth anything."
4,BB Rocks,"Not quite as good as Saturate as an album in whole, but there's a couple of briliant songs, like 'So Cold' & 'Rain(Bonus Track)' on this one."
2,Kind of a let-down,"I was lured in by ""so cold"" which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome track, but I felt the rest of the cd was mediocre. Frankly, the cd felt a little stale. Ben Burnley has a cool voice, but it wasn't, for the most part utilized effectively, and some of the lyrics left something to be desired as well. This is the only album I've heard from these guys, so I don't know how it stacks up in comparison to their other stuff. Didn't hate it, didn't love it."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made Vincent D'Onofrio Should Be Sentence to Prison for Life for Making This,"This is without doubt the worst movie ever made and Vincent D'Onofrio should be sentence to life in prison for making this utterly boring, incoherent, annoying piece of crap. If Aliens saw this movie, they would no doubt destroy Earth because this movie is man as its lowest form of intelligence, You suck Vincent D'Onofrio"
1,Dumb and boring,This movie was absolutely terrible. Acting was horrible from the beginning. And also from the beginning you can get a pretty good idea who the crazy one was. Totally pointless.
2,musical in the woods,"If you are expecting a horror/suspenseful movie... THIS IS NOT IT!! This movie should be called ""a group of morons in the woods singing!"" I must admit I was sold due to the previews, but was sadly mistaken through out. The acting sucked... plot sucked even more... and over all IT SUCKED... Sorry guys (sarcastically)! However if you want to sing and dance to a movie... Enjoy!!! By the way, this movie deserves two... no FOUR thumbs down, and I deserve a refund! Well I hope he got a good advance on his record deal as an artist/songwriter, this should be his LAST movie as an actor!"
2,"Great music, bad movie.","I'm not sure exactly what D'Onofrio was going going for here, but I'm guessing it was an excuse to sit hang out in the forest and smoke a little bit. The movie has a decent foundation to build an acceptable horror/slasher flick, but on all accounts they just pissed on it. The acting isn't terrible, the music is actually really freaking good, but it lacks any kind solid story, and you can find more believable violence on daytime public TV. Vincent liked some music and wanted to do something with it, calls were made, and somewhere along the way someone squatted and this movie fell out."
1,I thought I was watching a horror movie...,"This is basically a low-budget halloween episode of Glee based on the music of somebody who likes Bright Eyes.If that sounds like your kind of thing, enjoy.One of the most unfortunate things I've ever seen."
1,Never been so dissatisfied with a movie in my life! F-,"Thought this was going to be a horror flick. Just boring acoustic guitar work over and over (fast forward) over and over (fast forward) over and over. EJECT! This movie is completely worthless. I would rather eat shards of broken glass than to watch 5 seconds of this movie ever again. The director and producer should be banned for life from ever making another motion picture. If you have a copy of this movie, do everyone else on the planet a favor and flush it directly down the commode."
1,one star rating is one star too many,"Some bad films are still fun to watch, because they are so bad. Not this one. This is just plain awful in so many ways I can't even begin to say. Suffice it to say that this is everything bad about bad EMO music turned into a movie. Does that sound interesting? Of course not. Now you may be curious and say, it can't be that bad, can it? I think I will watch it and find out. Don't, you can do so much more with that time than watch this. Get a copy of Troll 2 and watch that. Stay away from this."
2,"Musical meet horror???? Guess he was going for a ""Little Shop of Horrors"" type thing but it didn't work for me","Creative idea but I ended up fast forwarding most of the musical numbers. Only rented it because it was directed by Vincent D'Onfrio. I had that stupid ""I'm In Love With a Man"" song in my head for days :/"
4,"A Murder Musical, Really, Whats NOT to Love?","Granted, it's a B horror movie, but knowing that going in, you don't expect this amazing plot. I was blown away by the music, to be honest. Months later, me and my group of friends that rented this together, still sing one of the songs often; my friend with his guitar. ""I'm a man on the edge of extinction"", the music really sticks with you. Now, not many are a huge fan of the cross genre horror/music, but I'm one of them. I love Repo! The Genetic Opera, Sweeney Todd, and I love this. Is it 5 start worthy like those two imho, no. But four stars for sure, as what it is, a b-rated horror movie with music, not for everyone but definitely for me! I love it and have rewatched it several times now, mostly for the music, lol. Music and murder go together like paint by numbers for me! Not for everyone but I highly recommend it!"
1,Crappy Emo music,"This movie is about an hour and ten minutes of really of a really lame band crying to each other about making it big. But don't worry because they threw in plenty of really bad emo music. In the last few minutes it just gets over the top, insanely violent and kind of doesn't make sense. I guess you like listening to some emo's whine about stuff then you might dig this movie."
2,Toshiba PA3182U-1ETC,Oder stylus under the item numbers for my computer and they are not for this type of Toshiba computer and not even close to the picture used for the 700 series.
1,"they are really bad, they scrach the screen","When you buy this from toshiba you expect a toshiba Stylus pen, like the one it came with you new Toshiba PDAbut they are not, they are Belkin Stylus in a thoshiba case,in the side of the stylus is writen Belkinand they are really badI use screen protectors, with other stylus, or with the original stylus, I change the screen protector every 2 - 3 monthsBut whith the ""Original Toshiba replacment"" (Belin)I have to change the screen protector every 2-3 weeks, because they really scrach the screen.Once I didn't use the screen protector and the scratch my PDA screem for lifeSo now I use Fellows Pen, the one that is a 2 in one, a normal pen and a Stylus pen."

With resources, budgets and many how-to tips, you'll be able to enjoy the RV lifestyle much sooner than you expect--and have a great time while you're doing it. Look around at the RVers on the road. With this book and some planning, you can join them."
2,nothing new in it that isn't in any job book,"I thot this would have info about full-time RVers.RVers don't stay in one place for long, and finding a job in such a circumstance is different than being in a stick-built house.Not a single idea about self-employment ideas for RVers.Things I thot it would have are pet sitting, massage, reflexology, helping at the rv park, errand services, cleaning, things that one can do in the rv park, or from an rv.Or places to work, like Walmart, JC Penney, fast food, businesses that are located nationally, where they will hire someone with short-term employment history.Or ideas of businesses to do over the internet, that can be done from one's RV.OK. I had those ideas on my own -- none were in the book."
5,Very informative and concise!,I enjoyed the insights that this book has. The author has listedmany helpful suggestions and ideas for any RVer just starting outor the fulltimer.
5,Very informative for the RVer wanting to supplement income,"This book is packed with information on how to go about job hunting, interviewing, working--all while living and traveling in an RV. From the first page till the last, it is easy to see that a lot of work went into compiling this information, sorting it in logical steps on how you can live your dream. Sprinkled throughout are real-world examples from real people traveling and working on the road. Jaimie's book certainly helped us feel more comfortable about making that leap from a traditional job market to one that combines a love of travel with the potential to earn an income at the same time. We can't wait!"
5,Awesome,Excellent book a must have if you are thinking of RVing for a living or just part of the year. A definate buy! I also recommend Complete Guide to Full Time RVing: Life on the open road. The two books help and provide information the other doesn't provide.
5,Most fantastic and unique book of it's kind!,"Of all the books on the Monterey Peninsula that we have seen over the years, your is the most unique documentary of the area presented in such fun- filled and a beautiful format.R.denzil Lee,AIA"
5,In with a bang,"The Brothers had experience with Q Jones and others, but they came in with a bang on this project. ""I'll be good to you"" is one of the all time great R&B songs.."
3,Look Out For #1: Brothers Johnson,"The Brothers Johnson debut album offers stylistic variety: solid gold pop funk - ""I'll Be Good To You""; jazzy instrumental - ""Tomorrow""; jazzy funk instrumental - ""Thunder Thumbs and Lightnin' Licks""; funk chant - ""Get the Funk Out Ma Face""; a touch of the Funkadelic - ""The Devil""; as well as a Beatles cover - ""Come Together."" What all this proficient variety means is that if you are searching out more pop masterpieces such as ""I'll Be Good to You"" you have to look to the next album. Solid album but be forewarned about the banal invitation extended by the egregious ""Land of Ladies"": ""Would you like to come with me to the Land of Ladies?"" Please."
5,Get the funk out my face.,In my opinion the brothers johnson are one of the greatest funk bands ever.I love the bass guitar its way funky.If you love to groove and love funk buy this.It wont disappoint
4,BLAM! In 'Yo Face!,"A bonafide 70's Funk Classic! While I liked this album alot, they'd often play one side of this whole album at the house parties back in the day.......used to make me so mad sometimes because as a dancer, I LIVED for two minutes (and twenty seven seconds) of Get The Funk Outta Ma' Face! But then the 45 version came along at a full 6:00 with that nasty fonky break down. If that's the version you're looking for - it's NOT here! Regardless, if you want a proper introduction to the Brothas, or you just love the era and the genre, you'll want to get this! This one, Right On Time and BLAM!"
1,Wrong item,"This was purchased as a present and sent directly to the recipient, after they received the gift I realized that it was the wrong item that was sent.The return policy was very strict about the product not being opened and along with it being a gift, I decided not to fight to get the correct item.I couldn't find the item that was sent on the website so I don't know if their was a price difference.The recipient of the gift was happy with what she received."
2,Disappointed,"Unlike my other karaoke CDs, this one does not let you owner the volume on the recording so one can sing with the recorded voice faintly in the background. The recorded voice is full volume or off."
3,Misleading Information,"The Product description for this item is MISLEADING. This is a Home Fountain, so why is there also information about the Aztec COMMERCIAL fountain above (under product descrption???Also VERY over priced, could be found MUCH cheaper on Sephra's homepage!"
5,Beautiful,"Another great singer-musician from Mali. Everything here is flawless. There's no lush arrangements, just penetrating vocals over 3 or 4 acoustic instruments and percussion. I can't speak to the quality of the lyrics, but Kokanko's singing is so heartfelt one doesn't need to know. The production is very good throughout. If you can get this CD at a decent price don't hesitate to add it to your collection."
4,Beautiful acoustic music from Mali,"This is a lovely, simple, down-to-earth set of acoustic music from Mali, featuring singer and harpist Kokanko Sata Doumbia. It's very pretty, though very sparse. Perfect for world music fans in search of regional music that is unspoiled and authentically traditional. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue music guide)"
4,LED friendly flasher relay,This relay allows the use of LED light bulbs in a vehicle and will keep the blinkers from blinking too fast.
4,"funny, touching, and a great read","Murphy is a very funny, charming writer whose book is as much about family and life as it is about football. A perfect gift for football fans as well as football widows."
2,Expensive paper weight / noise maker,"Because I an an optimist, I will say that eventually, this may turn out to be a good product. Unfortunately, two weeks after it was delivered, I still don't know, because it arrived broken. Once the engine started, the generator did not produce any electricity. Zilch. I brought it in to the local manufacturer's repair facility (which involved the difficulty of hoisting its 200+ pounds of bulk into the back of my vehicle), and it is still there after almost two weeks, due to the fact that the repair facility did not have the replacement parts in stock, AND they are backordered.Needless to say this has been frustrating. Looks like Porter Cable needs better quality control in its manufacturing. Good thing we never get any bad storms out here in the Pacific Northwest."
1,Blaahhh!!!,"Poor quality Item. Fan is made of some type of cloth/felt material that isn't very effective unless you hold it right in your face. It's also noisy! Major bummer, even for this price. Better to pay more and get quality."
1,If I could save you from the embarrassment... please don't buy it!,"I received my shipment from Amazon just yesterday, and when I opened up the package, I kid you not, I think it's probably the absolute lowest quality product I've ever bought from Amazon. The fan itself is a piece of flimsy foam, and the case is made of cheap plastic that is poorly glued together, clumsily painted, and looks like it came from a high school science project. The battery cover is nearly impossible to slide back into place once the batteries are in place (the spring pushes the batteries up, and you need to do some contorted trick to keep them pushed down while trying to slide the cover back in place). And then get this: when I flipped the switch to activate the fan, it didn't work! Why am I not surprised...Just wanted to save you the hassle of having to wait for this and be met by the same frustration if you happen to be considering this. It's the same advice I'd give to a friend if he or she were looking at it."
1,keep your money,"This book was not enlighting, alot of the information was out date. The phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc."
2,Getting yours,"This book has information on many goverment agencies, but does not have specific locations on how to get it as an individual."
5,Very disturbing and interesting at the same time,"This movie felt like ""The greatest made-for-TV-movie EVER created"". It has a few scenes that give it an R rating, but the overall quality of the movie seems like it was made for TV.Quality aside, this was a GREAT movie. It has such an expansive storyline, that I'd almost call it a horror soap-opera. But don't let that turn you away from it, It was the most refreshing unknown movie I've seen in a very long time.Also, don't let the premise of the movie fool you, it starts out feeling like a complete rip-off of Misery, with a cartoonist instead of a novelist meeting a crazed lady, but it goes worlds beyond that. The whole time I watched it, I kept wondering what new twist to the plot they would do next, and every time they took a new turn, it just kept making the movie better. It almost felt like 4 good storylines (or 3 sequels if you will) intertwined into one movie. Superb and creepy!"
5,Good product,"I'm very happy with this fan. Quiet, moves a good amount of air, and I expect that it will last a long time. I've been building computers for a long time and it's rare that fans come with screws. I can't believe people rated this fan badly because of that. Fools."
2,It's loud,"This fan replaces the OEM fan in a NAS enclosure --- the original fan became noisy after five years. Knowing this fan is twice the thickness as the one it replaces, I was hoping that in order to move the same amount of air it could run up to twice as slower, thus making the fan quieter. Not the case here. It is much louder than the OEM fan (when it was new)."
2,No way to attach without proper hardware,"Since I do not stock odd-sized nuts and bolts, I am not sure if I will ever be able to attach these fans. At a minimum, it will require another Amazon order and long wait time. These should come with hardware given the odd size of the bolt hole."
3,"Good for the casual fan, but one error","Why did A&M; not put the live version of ""Dreamer"" on this collection in addition or instead of the studio cut? The live song is much fuller and far superior when compared to the studio version. The live song was the very first 45 I ever bought and completely wore out.I did end up buying the double ""Live In Paris"" album just for that song and do enjoy listening to the whole thing, but I still wish it would have been on this collection."
3,Memory failed me,This album contains a few good songs and quite a few duds. The price was right to buy the whole album. Don't give too much for this - individual MP3s may be a better way to go.
5,Dreamer.,"As a casual Supertramp fan, this compilation serves as an excellent overview of a talented band. All the hits are here as well as some other great songs. The only shame is that this set hasn't been digitally remastered and repackaged with new liner notes. This is a must have for any rock collector."
3,"Good, but Small Problem?","First off, ""Goodbye Stranger"" is shorter than another version I have. I have a version where you can here the killer guitar solor in its entirety (unlike the version on this CD). Maybe the group released a shorter version for radio play? I also am not a big fan of these A&M Classic CDs since the CD in-lays are cheaply done with short and boring information about the band's history. You'd probably be better off finding a different version of their greatest hits (after all, this CD is out of print) -- but check the song length of ""Goodbye Stranger"" before buying."
4,Good Sound; Almost All the Singles Hits,"This CD contains 9 of the 10 Supertramp singles tunes that charted on the Billboard 100. Just ""My Kind of Lady"" (peaked at #31) is missing. I tend to focus on singles hits for my music inventory which I sometimes play as a deejay.Two track I could have done without: ""Crime of the Century"" and ""From Now On"" They drag a bit. But I thought two non-hit singles were good: ""Rudy"" and ""Hide in Your Shell"".The music is generally well composed, and the sound quality is good. I'm a 50s guy who enjoys popular music from the 40s into the 80s and some beyond that."
2,"Get ""The Very Best"" NOT ""Classics""","""Classic"" Supertramp was released in 1987 when it was still common to cut a minute or two off of songs and master the CD from a 10th generation master that happened to be available. As a result, several of the songs on ""Classics"" have the guitar solors chopped and the poorly remastered sound quality similar to an eight track tape.It is shameful that Amazon.com would be selling this 1987 product in 2011 when the FAR better ""The Very Best of Supertramp"" has the same songs in their full length versions remastered from high quality master tapes. ""Very Best"" has sound quality that makes it seem that you are in the studio with the band.Yeah, the GOOD version costs $2 more...less than the cost of a hamburger to get the REAL Supertramp."
1,Don't get me wrong......,"I'm a huge Supertramp fan, but I was crushed upon purchasing this collection. I picked it up just before closing time and hurried home to make a cassette copy (this was the late 80's,) only to find that they'd shortened several of the songs, Goodbye Stranger in particular. I was sitting there, singing along with the stereo, and when the whistling solo was supposed to start, I started whistling right alongside, only I found myself whistling alone. CD's like this one are the kind of things that give record companies a bad name. They might be okay for the casual fan, but if you're serious about a particular group, I'd steer clear of the A&M Classics releases."
2,"Rough implementation, but has potential.","It looks like this game was made by some clever programmers with a great concept, but the final product is unpolished. For example, during the installation it asks if you want to install Direct X (which is needed to run the game), but if you answer 'yes', it says the installation is successful, but you still have to go install Direct X manually. I tried installing the game on 3 different computers, but it only worked on one. I could live with the installation hassles if the program was easier to use, but the navigation and usability is terrible. There is no online help (except for one file which describes the installation process), and no printed documentation. Switching between tracks and moving between menus was sooo slow; I spent as much time waiting as racing. I haven't tried the multiplayer feature yet. This game has great potential, but was a huge disappointment for me."
3,Satisfactory Collection,"Little did they know when they released this album in 1977 that the duo would have two more big hits (""Do That To Me One More Time"" and ""You Never Done It Like That""). Had those two cuts been included, this would have been the only collection you'd need. Still, the big hits are all here, with some nice fillers, including versions of ""I Write the Songs"" and ""Wedding Song."""
3,Only one TRUE stand-out song,LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER will forever be the song that epitomizes the Captain and Tenille. Songs like MUSKRAT LOVE are easily forgettable. Toni's versions are SHOP AROUND and I WRITE THE SONGS are okay but not as good as the original. Not enough umph!
1,E-gads!,"I can't believe that a CD likes this exists and that there is anybody that would want it. ""Muskrat Love"" is easily one of the worst songs of all time. The rest is merely terrible."
3,THEY STILL HOLD UP AFTER 25 YEARS.,"The Captain and Tennille still hold up with pop icons like ""Love Will Keep Us Together"", and ""Shop Around"". Tennilles voice is always a marvelous wonder especially with ""Disney Girls"", but the CD loses it with pop schmaltz like ""Muskrat Love"", ""Circles"", and ""Can't Stop Dancin'"".....but thats okay they've got ""Lonely Night (Angel Face) too, so overall its a good CD of pop past."
5,What a deal!,This product has given my truck new life without spending tons of money! I'm so very happy with it! Everyone who needs the switch & has a sturdy bumper with a ball hitch on it should get one! Bravo!
3,Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer,"The portable hairdryer works wonderfully; however, the bonnet is not very sturdy and has already started coming apart where the hose attaches to the bonnet (disappointed with bonnet durability)."
5,Great alternative to the hard bonnet style!,Purchased to help a handicapped woman who can not sit up straight and hold the position needed for the hard bonnet hair dryer. Does a great job!
2,Hose Won't Stay Attached,"Despite rotating the hose until it clicked solidly in the bonnet, the hose constantly fell off when I tried to use it. To reattach, you have to remove the bonnet from your head, and redo the connection. Very annoying. Heat: Even the ""Low"" setting is very hot. I had to turn it down repeatedly to the cooler setting, then when it lost the heat, turn the control back up to the low setting. Not a good design."
1,Poorly made dryer,I just got this dryer last week. You can get burnt with this dryer as the heating vents are placed in odd areas on the bonnet. Also the attachment on the bonnet (the one you hook the dryer tube into) came out completely only a few days after I got it. So I am unable to use. I will not purchase again. I did not purchase from amazon.com but thought the review would be useful.
2,Not so bad as I first thought,"I wrote a terrible review for this after my first use but now I'm feeling better about it. In fact, I'm using it as I write this. At first I didn't think it heated my whole head, but it does. It's just not as powerful as the old bonnet dryers I remember from my youth. It works OK though. I can't seem to alter my rating but I'd give it three stars instead of two."
2,"Okay at First, Then Fell Apart","I bought this dryer about two years ago, and I used it for deep conditioning my hair after washing. I have thick, kinky hair and this dryer didn't get my hair completely dry. They dryer was quiet which was good, but it also wasn't very powerful. About a year ago the plastic ring that attached the hose to the bonnet began separating from the bonnet. It eventually came apart entirely. Unless I tie the opening on the bonnet around the hose, the dryer is now useless."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this dryer over one year ago and only used it once. The first time I used it there was an unusual odor, but I thought it was because the bonnet was new and was giving off a strange plastic smell. It worked fine the first time, but the smell was almost suffocating. I did not use the dryer again for many months and when I turned it on it did not work at all. I called Amazon and there's nothing they can do. It has been well over a year since I purchased it, so I cannot get any type of refund. I would not recommend anybody to purchase this item, but if you do, please use it regularly (to make sure it's going to keep working) before the 30 day return period has lapsed. I would hate for anybody else to waste money like I have."
4,Just what I needed,"Bought this as my old hair dryer dried my hair in more ways than one. This dryer is great, It is a little noisy but that I dont mind. Works pretty fast and have only had to use it on low heat. My hair is quite long but fine. High heat would work faster obviously but I am happy with low. If it gets to hot for my head I just turn it to cool for 5 mins then back to low or high."
2,Try Something Else,It worked Ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died. When working heat in the bonnet was not equally distributed.
2,there must be something better out there,"I bought this dryer as a temporary dryer until I can afford to mount a professional dryer from the ceiling. Anyway, this dryer is HOT. So HOT that children shouldn't use it. I have to put a big thick towel around my neck otherwise I get burned. It's LOUD and the hose does keep falling out. Other than that, it's OK. I'm just trying to hold on until I can get rid of it."
1,Hairdryer,Disappointing product. Works but started coming apart shortly after purchase. The hood is stiff and is coming apart at the hose. I think they better evaluate their quality if they want to sell other products.
2,Didn't Last,Only worked two times. The third time I used it the air flow was so weak that the bonnet woud not inflate. Looking for a replacement now.
1,Good dryer but horrible bonnet,"The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn't last long. Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact. If they make one with a decent bonnet, I'm there but this lasted about 6 uses and the bonnet broke off."
2,"The bonnet collapses and is so hot, I hold it up with a clothespin!","I use this dryer exclusively for when I color my hair with a henna because henna is heat activated. So I do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna. (Not sure why the byline says ""from a 12-year-old reader.)The high setting does a great job activating the henna, but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if I did not hold it up manually. Except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch, I attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is ""cooking"".It may work better with rollers, but the best idea would be to make a lighter bonnet that puffs up on its own, like the one that came with the old Carel dryers.When I called the manufacturer to tell them that the bonnet acts that way, they were defensive. If they could fix that problem, they'd have a much better dryer."
1,hair dryer,"This product should have come with a warning. Even on the LOW setting, one can get a third degree burn from the heat."
1,TOO HOT!!!!,"I was in great need of a new dryer, and bought this one prior to reading the reviews. In summary, the dryer is just too darned hot to use at the ""high"" setting. You really could injure yourself using the high setting for too long. Unfortunately, I'll have to purchase a new one...and this one was a total waste of money. If you can withstand the high heat (trust me, I'm accustomed to sitting under a dryer and am pretty heat tolerant) on this dryer, then go for it. If you're anything like me, the high setting is just intolerable. Good luck."
2,Hot and Loud,"I've been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke. This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn't dry very well. The low setting while cooler doesn't dry your hair. I thought the exessive heat would make your hair dry in half the time but it doesn't. This dryer also makes loud straining noises, which I am hoping doesn't mean the motor is about to quit.My old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find. What can you do."
1,Not so hot!,"I had trouble getting the bonnet to attach to the hose, but finally got it one there after 10 minutes of struggling. The dryer worked great the two times I used it ( the ionic part was terrific - dried my hair very quickly) and then it broke. No more air - didn't drop it or do anything to it, it just stopped working. Returned it for refund, but what a pain in the neck that was. Anyway, I do not recommend this dryer to anyone. I am currently searching for a new soft bonnet dryer and so far nothing I see is really any better."
1,Poorly Designed,Hose too short and IMPOSSIBLE to keep to the bonnet. Falls out repeatedly until you want to scream!! Junk. Not worth $40 total.
4,Great little Hair Dryer,With the exception of the hose being a little short - this is a great little hair dryer that has 4 temps. It is light weight - easy to store and easy to travel with - I recommend it!!!
1,delivered too late for holidays,"I am unable to provide feedback on this product. I did not receive it until after the holidays, therefore it was shipped back to the company"
1,Cinderella,"Very good. We enjoyed it. It was a good production and recommended to others. Nothig more for me to say, but send me the same request for ""Madama Butterfly"" and I won't give you the same ""glorious"" response. CGK"
2,Buy at least 10 of these at once,These servos are pretty brittle and burn out very quickly but they're so cheap you may as well just stock up on them to have on hand for parts once the next one blows - which it will soon...
2,Not unless you want the wrong information,"if you really want a book about hunter thompson, read ""Gonzo: The Life of Hunter S. Thompson"" by Jann Werner and Corey Seymour. a bunch of the dates and names of people in this book are wrong. it's greatly detailed, very candid about many of thompson's assignments and the events, etc., but the number of things i've found factually wrong in this book makes me wonder whether all that detail is even correct. at least in gonzo, the facts are from the people who knew thompson best and were there to see it all happen."
3,3 stars,"Extensive and enlightening information on Thompson's early past and influences, but overall lacks insight on the main body of his work and life. Nonetheless a compeling book and very hard to put down. Whitmer's ultimate conclusion is that Thompson is a tragic figure, unworthy of adoration. After reading this book, you may agree."
5,Excellent,"I've read each of Litton's books as it hits the bookstores and I eagerly await any new work.This story won't disappoint any of her fans and it will definately hook any new readers. Clio (daughter of two of Litton's best characters Atreus and Brianna) travels to England with her parents for the coronation of Victoria, the new Queen. From a family of women who have supernatural 'gifts' that come forward during times of peril, Clio has always been simply normal. But she starts to hallucinate about the past while at the estate of William, our hero. Of course they fall in love, but they also work together to find those behind the plot to kill the Queen.The sex scenes were rather gratuitous but overall this was a great book to read. I loved the new characters and it was great to see the new additions to the family trees."
3,Good up until ending,"This was a great love story and up until the end I would have heartily recommended it. In the end, they never really wrap up the case and you think...that can't be the ending.... Haven't read any of her other books...but I sure hope they end better than this one."
2,Don't Buy It!,"The reviews that I read mentioned that the sound on this set was not very good, but it is worse than that: it is lousy. I gave this to my 82 year old mother for a Christmas present to replace the 4"" B&W; TV she keeps by her bed, but even she complained...not just about the sound, but the picture, too.There are a number of adjustments for the picture - tint, clarity, sharpness - etc. but nothing could help get the picture to be clear.After you've seen really great small screen lcd TVs, such as the Sharp Aquos series, you'd never be satisfied with this dog. I sent it back after a few days.Comes in a nice carrying case, and the design is very good, but picture/sound are bad. Don't buy it.It's too bad that it isn't better, because there are not many screens this small to chose from. Sharp does not get down to this size.rjp"
4,Great Price,"The picture quality is very good, the sound is acceptable. I wanted a little tv/dvd player for my office and it suits my needs and you can't beat the price!"
5,Best product to detangle kid's hair,Very impressed with this product. I have tried other detanglers out there and by far it is not nearly as effective. I will be using this product for as long as I comb out my girl's difficult hair.
4,Strong On Blues With A Dose Of Soul,"Free was a band brimming with talent. Paul Rodgers displayed a powerful style as a lead vocalist. Bandmates Paul Kosoff, Andy Fraser, and Simon Kirke added fine instrumental touches.Fire and Water offers the rock n roll classic All Right Now which is loaded with energy. However there is more to that fine singles on this recording. Fire And Water is loaded with fine hooks and stunning guitar work. Mr. Big features some fine interplay between Andy Fraiser's soloing bass and Paul Kosoff's power chords. Heavy Load and Oh I Wept feature some fine slow blues playing with some good atmosphere. Remember offers a steady blues pattern while Don't Say YOu Loe Me features some soulful Paul Rodgers wailing.This recording is not as structured as Bad Company would later be. However, there are many noteworthy instrumental and vocal touches that will capture many fans of good time rock n roll. Seek this recording out as it has many merits."
5,their finest hour,"free the blues rock band fronted by paul rodgers who now fronts queen...whoever you think this is not the point of this review this review is about ""fire and water"" the classic masterpiece that has gone down in history for one song ""all right now""yeah it's a fantastic song but there is 7 other songs you knowetc..oh i wept, heavy load remember...paul rdgers had a great vocal delivery on this album and the rest of the band play to form a tight knit union CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC"
5,Rock On,"Back when rock was still cool, these guys broke it down to its basic components and spit it back at us. Oh so fine."
3,"A Classic For Sure, But Far From Perfect","The album starts beautifully with ""Fire and Water"", but as you keep listening to it from beginning to end, it keeps losing its momentum, with the exception of the popular ""All Right Now"". Approach with caution."
3,"The operative word is ""International""","This well made book should be handy for people who work in the world of international broadcast media. Many entries identify media-related organizations of various countries. There are some technical entries but bear in mind that technology changes rapidly, and a book of this size can hardly be exhaustive. This is a dictionary, so the entries are short though they often include some helpful supplemental information."
5,Porter Cable CPLMC7580V2,Amazon had the compressor shipped quickly. It arrived on time with free shipping and a lift gate delivery with no extra charge.The compressor was bought for use in restoration/modification of autos in a private garage. The compressor replaced a 26 gal 5 Hp peak oil less compressor. The new compressor is quite and quick. From empty to full (175 psi) is just over 6 minutes. When the compressor kicks on with a DA sander running it take just around a minute to fill to 175 psi. The air is many times dryer than what I had before. The air filters are lasting many times longer.
2,Not working,The compressor is only 3 months old and we are waiting for authorization from Porter Cable to have someone come and fix it. In the meantime we can not work because it will not run.
4,Its OK not as good as the foam in the can,"once the tube is squeesed in to your palm it takes alot of effort to get a good lather going, I tried putting it in to my shaving mug and using my 100% badger brush but the lather still wasnt that goodthe lather in the tube isnt as good as the lather in the foam canthe qnty in the tube doesnt seem to be too much eatherhowever the tube is less costly than the can ,but I think IM goin to stick with the canI still got a good shave with my double edge razorI would only by the tube again if I couldent get the can"
5,Dog lovers handbook,Purchased this book back in 2001 when I had 1 dog with lymphoma and 1 dog with SARDS. Now have a dog with Cushings I can't tell you how helpful it is to have a book to keep on hand as a reference. Diet is very important to a dogs health. I can't say enough good things about this book.
4,Bought the book for my Dad,I bought the book for my dad whose favorite dog was recently diagnosed with diabetes. It didn't sound like his Vet had given him much information beyond the most basic information (give the dog a shot at this time every day). My dad says the book answers many of his questions and provides him with the information he needs to understand the condition and properly care for his dog.
5,Does what it's supposed to,This does the job. We originally got it because my toddler would open the sliding door to the yard and it scared me. But putting this on each door really helps me not to worry. It also works great when my husband is out of town. It does the job and worth it. Very simple to use.
4,Great for the Price,It does what it says.Please note that it is not a profesional system.It work's great alerting you for intruders.
4,Value for money,It is a good product and we can have a better sleep whether we are at home or outside town. The siren is loud but only for apartment housing. I dont think it will work for an independent house. I have taken 1 star off due to installation issues. The tape provided is not strong enough.
4,"I can't use the door unit, because...","What kind of metal phillips head screw breaks down while you're trying to screw in the back-plate? So, while trying to undo the mess, the male portion of the plastic backplate broke off... Now, the door unit is useless to me.On the other hand the window units are just fine. I ended up using one of the three window units on my door."
2,Not much use.,"The door alarm is too loud on chime and the alarm setting did not function correctly, so have opted not to use that setting. The alarm was accidently set off and the code did not work to turn the alarm off.I had to find earplugs and then unscrew the battery doors to remove the batteries in order to get the alarm off.Subsequently have purchased a monitored alarm system.If the code had worked to turn off the alarm, it would be acceptable. Really, the fact that the code didn't work is ridiculously unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have returned this item. It did not work as it should. The alarm is deafening. The chime setting is also annoyingly loud.However, made me think that if I were a burglar, I would just wear earplugs."
3,Nothing great.,Relatively pricey. Too flimsy and hard to install using the double-sided tape. I like the fact that you can take the main unit out if you prefer to not use it. Chime is too loud for my tastes. Haven't really enabled the alarm yet.
3,Disappointed,"The smaller window alarms work fine, but it is hard to tell when the door alarms are armed and when they are not. It would be helpful if they had a certain colored light to show when they were armed and another color to show when they were not. I ended up taking the door alarms off and just putting the window alarms on the doors. They seem to be working fine, so guess I'll keep them. My advice.... just purchase the smaller window alarms."
5,pleased with product,The burglar alarm system works well. For the money I am well pleased. Put on door of garage. Very loud. It serves my needs in garage.
1,Alarm doesn't sound with metal door frames,I have not been able to make the alarm go off.I made it learn the access code. It will start or stop flashing when I key it in. But if set the alarm flashing and leave the door open for a minute it never goes off.I did get it to work in chime mode once on the kitchen table but it has never worked on the door. Hopefully metal in the door frame doesn't cause it to not work.I called their tech support and they suggested it was broken. If I return and get a new one I'll update.If you are setting one up and using the tape to affix to the wall I recommend not using the tape until you verify it works.UPdate: Further testing on kitchen table does seem to indicate door frame is problem.
5,JUST WHAT I NEED,"Excellent product, i feel a lot saver now, with this product, one thing tho, when u activate the alarm when u go away, and then u come back to your house, and u listen the beep, it takes a lil to much time to make the sound, the time frame needs to be less so if the burglar, enters your home, he cant do nothing in 10 seconds."
2,If you like dealing w/lemons,"Initially I really liked this alarm set. The door alarm is quite loud, and the smaller window/door ones are reasonable. However, I had barely had it for 2 months when the door alarm stopped functioning correct. You could still set the alarm, but it didn't go off if not disabled within the set time amount. In essence, it became useless. (And no, it wasn't a battery issue.)I bought a replacement. It was defective. I asked Amazon to send me a replacement for my replacement. That was also defective. I'm now sending both replacements back and I've ordered a higher-end system."
1,Poor Design,"I returned this item due to poor design of the door alarm. I was unable to find any indication of whether or not the system was armed, so there was no way to tell if I would set off the alarm when opening the door. The chime is not too loud, but the shrieking alarm is ear-splitting. There must be better devices out there!"
4,Right for the price.,"Unfortunately I had recently been robbed at night while I was at home sleeping and realized I needed something to alert me if someone were to open my door while I'm home. This unit has both a ""Home"" and ""Away"" mode and I use both. I even reccomended this item to my neighbor and he went out and purchased one as well. It is loud enough to be heard from a long way away and the first time I tested it my ears rang for a good 5 minutes afterward! For the price it really is an excellent product and it is easy to set up and program. It's certainly no where near the top of the line when it comes to home security systems but for my apartment it is perfect. I hope that anyone else who purchases this item gets the same peace of mind I got after installing it."
3,"works OK, but door system isn't very functional","Like everyone else says, you get what you pay for. System is OK for the price tag- window units aren't that loud, independent of each other and have an on/off switch, but they buy me time to reach for other items at my disposal if someone was trying to break in.Main concern is the door key pad, it doesn't always work unless the door is opened SLOWLY! What criminal, professional or otherwise, opens a door slowly 100% of the time?! Alas, like I stated earlier though, get what you pay for-works OK for an apartment, definitely don't get for a house.PS. If anyone knows how to fix the door issue I'm having, it would be much appreciated!!"
3,GE 51107 WIreless Alarm,"I'm 1/2 & 1/2 on this one because the one's on my window work great, I have 1 on each and when opened the alarm is very loud you can hear it threw out my complex but these don't fit on my door due to the way the shape of the front door is designed, I tried to place them in many different directions (So it's not there fault it's just the door design because the other's work perfectly)..Thanks"
4,It is what it is and it does what it says it does.,"I use these in conjunction with OTHER security measures. These alone might scare off some prowlers, but if you really want to be secure you'll enact additional protocols. Combine these with a few cameras hooked up to a DVR and a motion sensor plugged into a phone line, oh, and a gun - then you're good to go."
1,Only chime works,"After attaching the alarm to the door, I tried it several times on the chime setting. Works fine. But when I set it to alarm, nothing happens. Set it to AWAY, nothing. Set it to HOME, nothing. I put in the code and the light blinks 3 times, then nothing. Switched it back to chime, works fine.I didn't pay for a door chime, I paid for an alarm."
4,Loud as hell,The main alarm all I have to say is loud as hell (scare you to where you'd pee yourself if you didnt know it was coming) The one thing I kind of dont like is that the alarm is delays about 30 sec and it gives a little chirp when tripped. 30 sec is enough time to break it before it goes off if you were to notice it ( as the thief ) but other then that its not bad and super loud
2,Be Ware: Defective Product,"The window alarms worked fine, but the 'Alarm' mode on the door alarm did not work at all -- very disappointed. Returning this junk is not worth the hassle, so I'm going to eat this loss. In retrospect, I should've just bought it from Home Depot so I could run back and return it with no hassle. First bad Amazon experience in many years. I suppose there's a first for everything."
4,Super simple security system,"I bought 2 of these & covered all pertinent doors & windows, installation is a breeze, use is easy.... alarm is loud ! the chime is nice too. The window arms are nice & easy to install as well - set'em & forget'em :) Sure, there are things that could be better, but then it would cost more... so i feel they struck a good balance between cost & quality. Now when i leave home, i do so without much concern about whats going on while away. & thats worth every penny i had to pay :)"
4,"extremely loud, easy to install",the door alarm unit is extremely loud (120db)! it's easy to install and takes no more than 15 min. i usually set it to Alarm+Away mode and turn it on whenever i leave home by keying in the 4-digit code. Recommend for those who needs a simple alarm system and wish to save for the wiring and hacking works.
3,"works well, hard to get the large door unit to stay in place. The unit by the door keeps falling off the wall when the door is",hard to get the large door unit to stay in place. The unit by the door keeps falling off the wall when the door is used. Don't want to screw into wall.
4,HOME ALARM,"Couldn't buy much better for the money! Small and easy to install, this alarm is excellent for seniors and anyone with difficulty using hands. It is quality."
5,Scared me to death,"While staying at my son's apartment, I didn't know that he had set the alarm upon leaving one morning. I opened the door, and just about had a heart attack. I didn't know the code to turn it off, so I had to call him and find out the code. Of course, he thought that is was hilarious, I was scared to death. I am purchasing some for my home. Needless to say, this works well."
4,A SMART ALARM FOR THE PRICE,"I'AM SO PLEASE WITH THE ALARM SYSTEM! AT FIRST, I THOUGH FOR 20 DOLLARS I WAS GOING TO GET SOMETHING VERY CHEAP,BUT NO! IT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL, VERY EASY TO OPERATE, THE ONLY THING I WISH IT HAD ON IT WAS A VOLUME BUTTON FOR THE DOOR ALARM, IT IS SO LOUD ON THE CHIME SETTINGS WHICH COMES ON EVERY TIME THE DOOR OPEN AND SHUTS! SO IF YOU PLACE THE DOOR ALARM RIGHT BY YOUR HEAD ON THE DOOR FRAME AS YOU WALK IN BE PREPARED FOR THE LOUD CHIME IF THE ALARM ISNT SET!"
5,It does what it is supposed to do,It is very easy to install. I just used the sticker enclosed to attach them to wood doors and Vinyl window. The sound is high enough. It does what a $25 alarm suite is supposed to do. I've NO complaints.
4,Good Buy,Good buy for the money. My in-law has dementia and wanders at night. The window alarms are enough to alert us if she opens an Exterior door. The bigger alarm if mounted on the exterior door will wake up the neighbors.All the alarms do have a Alarm or Chime Switch choice. The 3 smaller window alarms are not as loud. Can't beat the price.
3,Meh,"It is wireless insofar as there are no wires to connect the separate units. There is however no wireless connectivity or radio communication.The units do work and are pretty loud, but the use of wireless is a bit of a stretch."
5,LOUD AND ALARMING,"THIS PRODUCT IS DEFINITELY A LOUD SYSTEM AND IT WORKS!!!!!! IF A PERSON BREAKS IN THEY WOULD GO DEAF BEFORE THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO TURN IT OFF, AND RUN . A GREAT BUY."
4,Good System For Apartment,"Very easy to install, and operate. Great for an apartment or rental unit. Alarm is loud and would scare anyone away."
2,Don't Buy,"So it says that the main device and its particular sensor device has to be at most 1/2 inch away. I set mine up so it was even less than 1/4 of an inch away. Didn't even register that it was there. no chime, no alarm. Only when I took device and held them on top of each other it worked. NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE"
3,Poor design,"I purchased this product based on good reviews on the website. The installation was quick and easy. The alarm and chime works as expected, however, after one month of installation, the GE 45117 alarm system does not stay in position. The self adhesive pad can not hold the unit. On detailed inspection, I found a plastic pad on the back that keep the body of the alarm raised from the door, leaving the adhesive pad only a point contact. It falls on floor everyday now triggering either alarm or chime based on settings."
5,works as advertised.,"simple installation. just make sure you play with the window pieces first before actually sticking them on. the window units are actually simplistic - can be turned off or remove, crushed, or thrown away by the intruder. alarm is very loud but can be suffocated with a piece of cloth. so, it works as advertised but may not be effective against sophisticated intruder(s)."
4,It is like an electronic dog.,"Home, away, arlarm, chime. IT has it all. Quite useful and gives you a little piece of mind."
2,"ok, but not great","I don't like how the window alarm has a button to turn it off or on. My son can easily reach up and turn off the alarm and slide out the window without us knowing. We were hoping to deter him sneaking out, but this product will not help."
1,crap. save your money.,"It worked when I set it up and tested it. Now a couple days after my warranty expired I have realized it is defective. I forgot to enter the disarm code when I came in, it never sounded. I tested it several times and nada. Waste of money. But I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Don't waste your money,"I did read all the reviews so I decided to try an inexpensive alarm system to be used in my apartment after a few days of activating on/off I noticed that it did to work at all seriously is a waste of money $30 dlls is not much but at least you can use this money to buy something better,. The windows alarm is laud enough to scare the thieves unless that is in the middle of the night it may be effective however the door alarm doesn't work as Described, also it shall be installed right on the door so is so easy to destroyed in no time for somebody break into your property. Please try something else perhaps more expensive I don't understand why people write such of great reviews for this useless system."
3,Does anyone know if the windows can be open?,"does anyone know if you can have the windows open slightly (6"") and have the window alarms set so that they will sound if someone tries to open the window further? I ordered this but have not opened the package, as someone else stated, if I break that molded plastic, I bought it!"
3,Hello air plane!,This product would work if you could stand the terrible sound it gives off.The sound is like you are next to an air plane. It would really protect your house but if you forgot to turn it off then you are in a run for your money.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"GE 51107 Smart Home Wireless Alarm System KitThe main unit does not work at all, the only thing that works is the window sensors. I just waste my money on this product."
2,"Pretty much a waste of money. Wireless is a joke, not interconnected","The term wirless implies that the three units are interconnected via transmission signals. They are simply individual battery operated alarms that can be destroyed within seconds by simply stepping on them. This is a toy alarm, pretty much useless in the real world. I should have paid extra for a true interconnected wireless system. Meanwhile, I will stick them on my two windows and the door. I should have returned this silly system, but I am too busy to do so right now."
3,"its ok,, fair","the ge 51107 its ok, nothing to jump up and down over, for what i paid its just ok, i need to buy more batterys"
3,Not Bad for the Price,"I'm not sure if I received a defective kit, but I didn't find the alarm to be all that loud. For $20 it isn't bad for how I intend to use it. I live in an apartment, and it will provide me with some warning to reach for my weapon and/or phone if someone attempts to enter the window. I have it set to alarm, and it would hardly awaken the neighbors as previous reviews have stated."
1,You get what you pay for,"This item was terrible. The window alarms are rather useless as they either make a very loud chiming sound or a mediocre volume alarm. Their main flaw is that the intruder can immediately silence the alarm by either breaking this small device or TURNING A SWITCH. There is no passcode for the window units. The door unit is even worse. The device doesn't want to accept the passcode sometimes. Sometimes it simply flashes a red light when the door is opened, even though the alarm is on ""home"" mode (which means the alarm should immediately sound when the door is opened). All of this basically means that I do not trust the alarm and I am so annoyed with it, I am sure I will not use it. I cannot even return the thing since it comes in one of those plastic molded containers that force you to mutilate the package to get to the product. Thanks amazon!"
1,This is a piece of crap,I bought this package hoping it would work so I wouldn't have to spend money on a monthly home security system like ADT and Brinks. I can say that the window alarms are very usefull but the door alarm is not. The door alarm after 3 months went out and you have to purchase another because there is no warranty on them.
1,Couldn't get them to work,"OK, the alarms are fairly piercing, but that doesn't do you any good if you can't get them to work. I installed the main alarm on the door of my daughter's apartment but couldn't get it to work, once it was installed. It appears that the sensors need to be nearly touching and exactly in alignment. The only time I could get it to work was when I was holding the sensors next to each other in my hands."
4,Very Loud,"Love it and it helps me to feel a little safer at nightIt is very loud, which is a plus! Might scare someone off trying to break in for sureI would recommend it"
2,returned,Not at all helpful. I bought two of the series and returned both of them. Mostly education jargen.
2,Rocket science,"I have had nothing but trouble trying to use this. PiMover is a great idea, but unfortunately the documentation is written in something that looks similar to English, but makes little sense! It's one of those where foreigners write the manual, and no one reviews it for English sensibility. I managed to transfer a few files by playing around with it, but even now don't know how I did it, so trying to repeat it means starting all over again. For me, this has been a waste of time and money."
1,Not good for Palm OS 3.1,"I'd give this gimmick zero stars if I could. I bought this not realizing that I would not be able to access the programs directly from the memplug. In order to use the files, you have to move them back to the internal memory. Which means you might have to move a file from the internal memory over to the memplug. Who wants to play musical programs? The company has come up with a ""fix"" for the problem. They have a new program called ""pi direct"" which allows you to use the programs directly. BUT THERE IS A HITCH!! You can ONLY use pi direct if you are running Palm OS 3.5. If you have 3.5, chances are that you using one of the newer machines with more memory anyway. If you have a Solo or Deluxe, save your bucks. I sent my memplug back."
2,Hardware reliability weak,"Product works great for a few months, then becomes unreadable despite all updates, Visor stops recognizing the module."
3,He's Mellowed,"A good story, but a short one (small pages, big print, double spacing). KD had a stroke at 80, and wrote about it three years afterward. He truly made a heroic effort to recover his speech, and went on to make two movies after his stroke. He animates his own life and that of others with humor and wrote this book particularly to inspire other stroke victims--he includes his own ""Operator's Manual"" of six rules at the end. He celebrated his second Bar Mitzvah at age 83 and is open in saying how the stroke helped the selfishness of his early years give way to a renewed and expanded spiritual foundation. He has a heart pacemaker, bad knees from a helicopter crash, and the sequelae of his stroke to deal with, so he talks frankly about his depression and preoccupation with death. But as his mother told him as she was dying, ""Don't be afraid, it happens to everyone."""
4,I send this to everyone I know who has a stroke,"It sounds horrible, but as I get older, many relatives are prone to strokes. I've had three in the past couple of years. Each time, I have sent them this book. To some extent, a lot of what's in this book are things that he is largely repeating from some of his earlier ones; but it is condensed (without most of the autobiography of other works) into lessons for life, particularly after a stroke, that are inspirational and surprisingly uplifting, without being too treachly or trite.Sometimes people complain ""why should ws listen to someone just because they're a celebrity?"" This book is a counterpoint to that - it reminds us that just because someone is a celebrity, doesn't discount them from reminding us what real life is about."
2,So so...,Do not buy this book. Not really worth it. I think the perl black book would be better and teach you more. There are some good hints in this book but you could find the same things on stackoverflow.com.
5,Perl manual or detective stories? It's both!,"Perl hacks is an intriguing book which explores specific problems and their quite practical solutions. This book is easy to dive in and out of. It reads more like a collection of bite sized detective stories rather than a novel.Either novice or guru Perl coders will discover great solutions to issues they don't even know that they are having. It's continually clever, surprising, and astonishingly useful.Part of what is most astonishing is that the cures to even monumental ailments are so short and sweet. Perl Hacks is a great way to rediscover how awesome Perl is."
2,Hardly a romance Book!,"Inspite of it being a flipside, this was supposed to be a romance story and yet, there was hardly any interaction between the central characters Alex and Lisa for the first 100 pages! For a book which is only 220 pages in length, I thought that was a big let down. Instead, it was all about Lisa and her antics and how she tries to get by without her husband. Very BORING! I liked Alex's character when he finally shows up but I never liked Lisa which doesn't say a lot about the book. Skip this one!"
2,Not worth the effort to find,"Ne'er do well middle child Lisa shocked her parents and flew to Vegas with a man she barely knew and got married. After three months of living with his stuffy wealthy parents, she flees back to Philly and struggles to find work (despite no marketable skills) and a new life without Alex. After several weeks, Alex decides to woo his woman back and became the type of bad boy she goes for. Off with the Brooks Brothers suits and on with the Levi's. Adding intrigue is her controlling Italian mother.I love Millie Criswell, but this book just didn't cut it for me. There is no real chemistry between the leads, in fact, Alex is doesn't make an appearance in the book until half way through. And the controlling mother is a little too similar to the smothering Italian mother in her Baltimore series of books (""The Trouble with Mary""). With a stale plot and no real chemistry, this one is for real fans only."
1,annoying and insulting,"It's hard to believe that readers will find much pleasure in the antics of this dim-bulb heroine. ""Immature"" doesn't even come close to describing 27-year old Lisa, who lives at home, can't hold a job, has no marketable skills, and marries a man she has known for a whopping three weeks. Alex, the estranged husband, labors mightily to win back his bride, but the biggest question has to be, ""Why bother?"" Reading about the antics of a woman determined to be a screwup is a waste of time. Stereotypical mothers-in-law and a plot that goes nowhere make this a disappointing effort."
5,Mueve El Esqueleto,THIS CD IS AWESOME. TOTALLY SURPASSES THEIR FIRST DISC WHICH WAS STUPENDOUS ! THE QUINTET GAVE 200 % INTO THIS CD. YOU WOULD NOT BE MAKING A MISTAKE IF YOU BUY IT COZ IT ROCKS OUTLOUD ! ESTE DISCO ES LA ULTIMA TODO TRIUNFAL SUPER GUAY !!! JAJAJA ! BUY IT TODAY !!!!
1,Not deliverable and unhelpful,I ordered this product with another order for Niacin in a lower dose. The supplier let me know that it was unavailable and was unwilling to offer the lower dose product in greater quantity to fill the order. This lead to a doubling of my shipping costs and made the product unaffordable.
2,I felt like I was gonna die,I heard this stuff was good for you and took it but I dont think I will take it again since I dont like to suffer.
1,Worst CPU Cooling system you can ever buy,this is the worst CPU Cooling system. too noisy and not even cool better than others cheaper system.
5,Hacking Linux,"Although I have only a few Linux stations to worry about, this book helps me sleep at night. For great security coverage of this hot operating system, this book is a good addition to your collection."
4,Can't put it down!!,"The book pulls you into a hackers/crackers mind! no boring bla-bla text that puts you to sleep in 3 minutes! the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it didn't come with a CD! Most of the books I've read came with the programs they discussed in the book, This was my only let down. I've contacted the authors about some questions and I received a fast and curtious reply. Hats off to you Gents, and I must thank Brian for his reply,about to much security, your one of the reasons I've switched from windows to linux. Try and contact Bill if ya got a question about windows!"
1,Not even worth the video tape...,"Although this film features several very good actors and a promising premise, their talents are wasted with atrocious writing and terrible directing. Don't even bother with this one."
1,"""But...I...uh...is it me?...""","That sums up most of the ""dialogue"" in this unentertaining movie. Don't be fooled by the presence of stars Ben Stiller and Jason Patric. They don't add any energy to the movie. I hope my friends and neighbors aren't this awkward and depressing behind closed doors, but if they are, it doesn't justify making a movie about them. The characters act ""bad"" but in a ho-hum, listless way. It's the type of movie that humanities professors assign you and make you answer probing questions like, ""Each of the characters has a conversation with the artist's assistant. Compare/contrast."""
2,"A real turkey, but the main ingredient is ham","Interested in one-dimensional characters? Endlessly fascinated by human denial? Do you like stock phrases of dialogue repeated again and again and again. Then by all means, shell out your hard-won dinero so that Mr. Labute can turn out more banal, callow films. Shocked? Thankfully, some of us aren't that naive. Bored silly is more like it. All in all, though, this is a good example of how tired and self-contained the ""independent"" film world has become, and the acting isn't half bad."
2,Wrong item,"I believe this item be a translator, but Sorprise, really was a software CD for Blackberry phone. I can do anything with this."
2,DECEIVED,"I was deceived into buying something that I did not want at an outrageous price. I thought that I was ordering as the advertisement says--Original Benny Goodman Trio and quartet Sessions-Vol 1-3. What I received was a single USED CD for $29.00. There is 1 trio piece and 1 quartet piece. Everything else is for big band with singers. That is not what I was ordering and that was not advertised in the listing. Vol.1-3 led me to think that I was getting 2 CD's for $29.00. I received 1 CD and it is used. As stated I WAS DECEIVED AND PAID A RIDICULOUS PRICE FOR 1 CD. I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY. AMAZON, WATCH WHO YOU ARE DEALING WITH AS A SELLER.Tom Greene"
4,"Missing the original ""Metal Priestess"" EP cover art!","What more can be said about this CD except: as a fan, I was sad that they didn't include the original cover art photo of WOW from the 1981 Metal Priestess EP - with her Black Leather Monster outfit and mohawk-cum-horn head gear - I still can't quite believe she performed dressed like that on SOLID GOLD (?!) - haha - I bet middle America was in for a shock. I would actually prefer the MP EP be released on a separate CD with its own cover art and bonus tracks for true Plasmatic collectors. Maybe in 2012?"
4,Recommended for public libraries & undergrad libraries,"Downing's concise study provides a sufficient orientation for nonspecialist readers vis-a-vis mysticism and mystical experience in the Western Christian tradition. His command of Lewis's writings is secure, and his discussion of mystical themes in the space trilogy and the Narnian chronicles is appropriate."
3,Quick and easy way to add usb ports to front of your computer,"It's a creative way to add usb ports to your computer. Mine PC is older and provided no front usb ports. This handy device makes it easy to add them. What's more, if you have a 3.5 inch drive like a floppy or zip, you can put that in this bay as well."
2,Hurts Like Hades on the Hottest Day of the Summer,"I used to bite my bottom gums all the time. Trust me I was a little bit of a masochist. While the blood rush into my mouth was soothing, the canker sore that was left always hurt far too much. So I tried this product and a few others and found that besides for stinging it made healing time last longer, by almost a week. So I would reccomend dealing with the pain and let nature take it's course."
4,"Bright, cute, and fun!","This durable board book has bright colorful drawings of the animals on the ark (along with Noah and family) and the pages slide open to reveal hidden animals. For example, the first page says ""What's hopping to the ark?"" The page slides apart to show a picture of kangaroos. The illustrations are very attractive and cute, and they hold the attention of my toddler. She loves to open the pages herself to see what's hiding inside. The sliding mechanism in this book works better than the ones in similar books I've seen. My 16 month old toddler is able to open the sliding pages herself and with a little bit of ""steering assistance"" from me (helping her line the page up right) she can close the pages too. The sliding pages add extra interest and keep her entertained for longer than a regular book.The text is simple but cute.Overall a great book for home or to take to church. Don't let the lack of a photo of the cover here scare you off. It's really cute and worth the price."
5,A great read!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in early Judaism and Christianity. Although many of the characters in the book are fictitious, the stories allow one to understand how real people at the time might have reacted to the events occurring in their lives. As an example, to read the biblical passages about Ezra requiring the Jews to divorce their foreign wives is one thing. But, to experience this from the perspective of a Jewish family actually having to separate yields a very meaningful understanding.Not only is the book pleasurable reading, but it is based on solid scholarship with numerous reference and explanatory notes. One can appreciate the book as well written stories getting the scholarship as a bonus, or one can read it for the information, but in a painless format. Professor Sandgren gets an A+ on this assignment."
2,Not Antec's best,"First of all, thanks amazon for not listing the dimensions of this... it is 38mm deep, not 25mm like the other 120mm Antec fan in my case. The only reason I bought it is cause I had gift cards and needed one, so I thought why not put an Antec fan in my Antec case. WRONG, it was a waste of my gift cards. It is just too loud. I have a Sonata case and this is the loudest thing in there... and it is even hooked up to the PSU's fan controller power cords, which supplys minimal power. It is just too expensive for the noise. Dont even think about connecting it to a regular 4-pin connector, I tried this and it sounded like a jet engine is in my room! It probably woke up my neighbors."
4,"Great Fan, burned out when placed in...","Great fan only lasted me a year. It burned out because it got too hot. It still runs but after about 2 days of use it will lock up.It got too hot because i had a fan grill that was far too restrictive on its airflow. This thing really pushes air and needs it to keep itself cool. I also had it running at a low speed, thus it freezes up.Would buy again, but im steering tward lower rpm and quieter fans these days. This thing has great power, if you place it on a floor it will push itself. Not too many fans can say that. Antec is a good name.It's a nice solid fan, but I'm past the days of loud desktop PC's, maybe ill consider this for my server."
4,actors can be multitalented,"As a huge 30 Odd Foot of Grunts fan (Russell Crowe's band), I immediately went out and bought this CD. Amazingly, many actors also have a talent for singing. I have kept up with Bruce Willis' singing career since Moonlighting, and I think he's really good. I had never heard Dogstar before, but I am beginning to like them. In my opinion, some actors/singers are better than the ones that are on Billboard's charts today (Eminem, Nelly, etc.)."
3,"don't quit your day job, please","This is a review only on what I heard from snippets from my computer, but I can quickly tell that much of this will go down with some of the ""Golden Throats"" recordings, e.g. Leonard Nimoy, Sebastian Cabot, William Shatner, Mae West and the like. Very funny and entertaining, but not good music or performing. Actually I kind of liked Mare's very pleasant folky voice, the rest were pretty sad... Does Jeff Goldblum sing on his track? Iggy Pop's track sounds like him, but is that Johnny Depp? Kudos a little for Milla's artsy rendering of whatever the heck that was, but I do like to look at her in her movies!"
5,Great Stuff!,"I really liked this book. It had an old-fashion action quality and something that turned me on a lot when I used to look at my dad's hardcover books--illustrations that perk up the story. The story itself grabs you from the first page. It's set in a time when aviation had a kind of sci-fi edge, and people were still romantic about the miracle of flight. There are good guys (and girls) and bad ones. There are surprises. There's some wonderful insights into the technology of early 20th century flying machines. This would make an absolutely dynamite movie. I hope some producer has the good sense to turn it into one."
1,Save your money.,"I couldn't get this game to run properly on either of my systems (Windows 7 and XP). There are no authorized patches for it. After downloading a number of user modifications, I finally got the strategic mode to work, but the tactical mode continued to crash on opening. So I don't know if the game is good or bad - there might even be a good game in there somewhere, but darn if I could get at it - just not playable as sold. I managed to pick it up for a few bucks and postage (I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with Napoleon and the period), so I didn't expect too much from it to begin with. What surprised me was I got even less than that. My advice is to save your money."
4,My opinion,"Some details are very basics, other are very good presented. In general it is a good book, a little expensive for its content."
5,Great Little Compressor,This compressor packs a lot of power in a small package. It is relatively quiet and extremely powerful. The pressure controls are accurate which are very helpful in my situation. I look forward to many years of use.
3,You had better be a fan,"This is a great book if you are a fan. It provides lots of information that you can't really find anywhere else (i.e. the timeline). this book suffers however when it comes to the game. there is not a great deal of substance to the character development process. Not enough species, skills, occupations or statistical ablities. If you have no knowledge of the comic book Usagi Yojimbo, you should avoid this game. It is not for the serious roleplayer, however, with a little bit of help and a lot imagination this fairly simple game can be a blast."
5,Happy Grandson,I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loves this shirt and has warn it quite a few times. We may have to get a replacement if he keeps wearing it so much! Great buy...great results. THANKS
4,super!,This shirt looked awesome when I saw it and when I tried it on! The both designs in the front and the back are cool... Until it got stolen while washing them at a public laundry mat :'(
3,Too new!,"The t shirt arrive fairly quickly. It's too brand new and I need to put a few washes in since Ride the Lightnin is an old album. I have Ride the Lightning guitar straps. This album is definately amongst my top 5 metallica albums. i wish the logo on the back were smaller though. or the logo be on top left of chest on front and the huge album cover be on the back. that would be really cool. if you think this is a good idea and want me to do layout for your t shirts, let me know..."
3,Good T-shirt but,"It's a good t-shirt (made in Mexico), good quality cotton and design but the Metallica logo is different: the grey part is really black."
4,"Great fit, Got what I paid for","This shirt was $10 with free shipping! The paint looks great, however you can tell the shirt is a bit thin -- the paint shows through if the shirt is inside out. Of course, I didn't expect a super thick high quality t-shirt for $10. This shirt is better than most ten dollar shirts you will find, and the fact that there's an image on the front and back for only that $10 is amazing.Edit: I'm also a tall guy, 6'4"" and 215 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fits fine -- a little lose, but I like my t-shirts that way."
4,Contact/Sphere,Contact is a good picture story held together by its main actor. A story that has more effect now with current global warming problems. I liked it so much that I bought sequel.Sphere is an incredible story at the time it came out brought closer to reality now with the latest scientific discovery that time travel is a possiblity. Actors are great and story line is clear.
1,Cheap. Short-changed....,"By putting out these two films on one DVD, I can't help but feel that Warner's has ""short-changed"" Contact by pairing it with such an inferior film like ""Sphere."" In my opinion, Criterion should have issued their own DVD print of ""Contact"" with all of the extras. I don't even see it in upcoming Blu-Ray releases and it certainly deserves that kind of upgrade. ""Contact"" knocked my socks off when I first saw it. The day it came out on LaserDisc, I bought it. The DVD had many extras on it so I got rid of the LD and picked it up on DVD. It's definitely a classic 90's sci-fi film that is NOT getting the kind of treatment (like a release on Blu-Ray) that it so richly deserves. This is a step in the wrong direction...and a slap in the face for fans!!! Forget it!"
4,Cheap but good,"This is a good pair of niche Sci-Fi movies. I'm not going to review the films in depth, so I suggest you seeSphereandContactfor more detailed coverage.The case includes a single DVD with Contact on the front and Sphere on the back. There is no labeling on the DVD and the packaging didn't release the DVD very easily so I felt very nervous handling it. Additionally, it was a little difficult to tell which side of the DVD was which because you had to look at small text on the inner ring of the DVD.From what I could tell, both sides were identical to their standard non-bundled counterparts. You're just getting two on one disc.These are pretty good movies with a little bit of a cult following (especially Sphere). The only bad thing here is the packaging."
5,Most Impressive Artist / Songwriter,"I had the pleasure of seeing and meeting Irene Kelley at the Midnight Jamboree when she guest appeared with David Frizzell earlier this year. I have always been a major fan of David's and thought his choice of Irene being a guest was incredible! I have had this CD for a few months and can not begin to tell you how many times it's been played ... Thank goodness it's not an LP, it would already be worn out.Irene writes and sings with such great emotion and from the heart ... She is a new favorite of mine!!"
5,Wow. Where did SHE come from?,"I heard Irene Kelley on the car radio on a trip to Boston and I pulled over just to make sure I got the name and album title. The music is somewhere between country and Americana -- probably more tilted toward the country end of the spectrum, but her voice is crystal clear and the arrangements are spare and clean. She reminds me of the early Linda Ronstadt, there's a little bit of that Western feeling to it.I can't recommend this CD enough."
2,Pretty good watch but I'd recommend the T5C441,"This watch has nice features but here are the drawbacks. 1) The red indiglo is very dim and you will have to focus your eyes to see it, in other words not that easy to see 2) The main rim on the face after only a week of use has had multiple places where the paint has flaked off...pretty bad paint job. I previously had a ironman #T5C441 and I'm just going to buy another one. The face is stainless steel and lasts a while (I lost my last one)."
3,Bad for Night Use,"This is a great watch with really good features. The display is extremely clear in the day time. The FLIX feature is also a great idea when you only have one hand free in the dark.However, the indiglo feature isn't very bright or easy to read unless it is pitch black. If you are running around dusk this becomes a problem, b/c it's too dark to see the display, but not dark enough to use the indiglo. If you primarily use the watch during the day, this can totally work for you."
2,A disappointing reference,"What sells this reference is it's lovely (and very persuasive) cover design. It would appear to be a 'Complete Reference' but it's not. There is much instruction that simply doesn't instruct, typos, and lots of wrong information. The 'Advanced Word Processing Techniques' chapter of the Word section is especially disappointing. Auto-Chapter Headings, headers and footers that work? Not here. Thanks to this book I've been spending more time (and quality time at that) in the Word newsgroups (and getting straight info). Any reference that 'fluffs' itself up with large type, large pictures, generous line spacing, and page after page of hugely set keyboard shortcuts is simply trying to fill up space. Look at other reference books before considering this one."
5,My favorite book,"This book is quite possibly the best book that i have ever read. I would put it up there with the likes of ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""A tale of two cities"", and ""The Great Gatsby"". The plethera of character traits always gets me and holds me at suspense. I have reccommended it to all of my friends in the Northern-Chicago, IL area and it has become a local hit and favorite. Personally, I am waiting on my knees for Ryan's next work to come out. Hooray for the chicken people and bravo, Ryan, bravo!!"
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST!!,"Okay, if you're a Ferrickhead and you DON'T have this CD, go out and buy it RIGHT NOW. I mean, RIGHT. NOW. Since I have become a fan of Melissa Ferrick about a month ago, I have purchased 4 of her CDs and listened to them ALL extensively. I would have to say that this CD is the best of all of the ones that I have. This album is a crucial addition to your Melissa Ferrick collection. Or just your music collection in general. This CD embodies all the passion and energy that makes Melissa Ferrick's live shows the best live experience you will ever have. From her random scat and humming with the music to her chatter with the audience, you can't NOT listen to it all the way through. This is a great mix of upbeat lyrics and frantic guitar playing and slower, more mellow songs. GET IT NOW!"
1,UNHAPPY!,"OK to the point! The book is the right title and author but when I recieved it, it was not a complete copy of what the origanial book had been. All the pictures were deleted. As were many other things. This was not stated in the information about the new book. As the author is a GG granduncle of mine I wanted the photos too. In the book it is explained that if I wanted the photos I had to download them. When I looked at the product veiw it showed the photos, index and contents, all not in the book. It is also stated in the book there could even be missing pages as the ""robot"" may not catch all the pages. The book does not even seperate the chapters. I think this book is misrepersented in the add by the seller, not Amazon. I have always had good luck ordering from Amazon"
4,"Hot Rods, Hot Girls and Hot Grills","This si the second installment in the ""Hot Chick Stoner BBQ"" series and let me tell you this one is so much better than the first. Real chicks, real cars and some real good recipes for anyone who has the munchies. The Gorgonzola Burgers are something to behold! Lots of great music, tips on changing your oil and great recipes to try out on all your stoner friends. Skip the first one and pick this one up instead."
2,Mundane storyline....,"Paperback has a very shallow, typical plot. Although I completely read the book, it was a struggle to finish simply because of boredom. Entertaining would not be an adjective for selection of this Patten paperback."
3,Enjoyed The Book...BUT,"I enjoyed this book, I also read it years ago.But some parts that seemed to repeat, repeat & repeat were annoying..! When she kept going over her childhood, Tell us once about your childhood and fears..we will remember later in the book when you bring up ""childhood or your Father or your fears from childhood""I would have liked a little more insight on the Hero. Some of the Epilogue could have been part of the story. The Epilogue could have had a little more about the other people in their lives..But, like I said I read this years ago and just recently read it again. I did enjoy the book. I will read it again in a year or two... Thanks!"
3,"Nice chairs, hard to assemble","We constructed our own dining table out of custom glass and wine barrels. We finally found these chairs which worked well for the height of the table and matched our decor. They are nice chairs and the price is good. They do require home assembly. These are far and away the most difficult chairs to put together. The instructions are poorly written, vague on details, and all around useless. I finally got the first chair together after an hour of floundering. They are nice but don't expect much help from the instructions in the box!"
3,"Ok chair, painful to assemble","These are decent looking chairs, and relatively sturdy, if you got all your screws in correctly.It took me and my husband upwards of 4 hours to figure out how to assemble one of them. if you have ever assembled ikea furniture, this is the exact opposite. there are a total of 4 pictures, and 9 parts, and 19 screws per chair. the screws are of 5 different lengths, the parts are all slightly different, and it's your job to figure out how this puzzle works based on 4 poor quality tiny images.we got it done. but were so exhausted, that we left the other one in parts. our nanny found it, and tried to put it together. took her 5 hours.good luck!"
1,disappointed,These were a joke for the price. I could have gone down to the local hard ware store and made my own for $2.00
3,Get what ya pay for,"These will work, but they are new and unfinished wood (not that smoothe) with plastic tips that have a point."
1,PLEASE NOTE PROBLEM WITH THIS ITEM,The description/editorial review section seems to be about an entirely different book than the one listed here by Diane Duane. Some problem within Amazon evidently.
3,"Surprisingly, not as bright as my LED grill light!","I have an LED grill light with a dual magnetic/screw-clamp mounting mechanism. Both the LED light and its clamp work well enough. However, I thought the fluorescent light would provide a brighter light and illuminate a larger area (the LED light illuminates a small area as if it were a miniature spotlight).I was wrong! The fluorescent light does cover a larger area bit with less brilliance. I decided to go back to using the LED.Another consideration the difficulty of getting a stable mount/grip with the fluorescent light's squeeze-to-open mounting clamp."
4,Wondering,"I was very interested in the observation at the beginning that psychic phenomena do exist on a much smaller, more personal scale, but that condemnation of same by the Christian churches was unwise. If psychic experiences were treated contextually as a natural part of religious experience (see William James), there wouldn't be such a fascination with the ""forbidden"", and Lamar's money-grubbing sideshows wouldn't be so enticing.I also wonder if the National Spiritualist Association of Churches or any of its leading lights has ever published an official response to Lamar's book."
3,anothersmith,"Interesting, but begs for confirmation by the end. Not very well written, but good enough to finish. An interesting consideration but unsatisfyingly unconfirmed. Examples, and bibliography much too old."
2,Too loud too flimsy,"I bought this compressor a few day ago. Well, it's quieter than 5.5 hp oilfree compressor I used to have, but still too loud for me. Also gauges do not have any protection and on/off switch is just a joke. Otherwise it works just fine. I'll get something else tomorrow anyway."
2,For me it was shallow,"I am a female and though I appreciated Ms. Howe's comments about certain aspects of prostate treatment effects, and what one could do about impotency (technically), I was overall disappointed in this book. I expected more depth/detail about the emotional and physical aspects of treatment options. As a female I wanted more information about the devastation we feel as a couple towards our sex life. I found this book to be more of a catalog of ""who is who"" in Cancer institutions and research facilities. To illustrate my point I got much more help and understanding from the book entitled, Adams Burden."
5,Fantastic for survivors,"This book is fantastic for survivors. On the back cover, Dr Andrew von Eschenbach, Director of the National Cancer Institute, and other experts have given this book the highest recommendation possible. I am of the same mind. rjh"
3,Helpful,Useful in my job to support parents. I use this frequently. People I have shared the information with it it helpful
1,hilariously awful,"Never before has a movie franchise completely called a mulligan on a movie. The next film in the series goes on as if this one were never made, and with good reason. If you enjoyed MST3K, then you will love making fun of this terrible, terrible movie."
1,Highlander missed it with this one!!,"The Worst installment of the Movie Series,actual makes watching Adrian Paul of the TV series more enjoyable.If you collect the series then grab a copy, if you not then just stay away."
5,The book is a work of art.,"The book is a work of art. Drawings, photos in black-and-white of chefs and their kitchens enhance the recipes. Most attractive are twelve color plates of foods one could die for, made from recipes in the book. If you want one beautiful book about Mexican food and how to prepare it authentically, get El Norte. TEXAS BOOKS IN REVIE"
2,Contradiction,"I find it ironic, at least, that someone who correctly criticizes patriarchy and its war culture is at the same time someone who supports Israel."
3,Pretty good...could be better!,"This is a pretty good cook book, it is a little sparce though. I don't really suggest it, but I don't go against it. You could find better, look, and you shall find. It isn't worth buying unless you are a straight up cook book collector and have a dying passion for books like this and feel you need to buy it, otherwise...look elsewhere!"
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"I am a busy SAHM of 2 preschoolers and love to entertain. I am always looking for ideas on how to cut down on prep time for meals and ""do-ahead"" type recipes. But when I received this book, it wasn't quite what I was looking for.The majority of the recipes would not be well received by kids (ie: Danish Blue Cheese Mousse, Celery Root & Beets with Apple Vinaigrette, Carrot & Orange Soup, etc.) -- let alone many adults.There a few recipes that are quite yummy. But many require some involved pre-preparation. Overall, this cookbook was a disappointment for me."
4,very nice little cookbook,"After tasting some of the recipes prepared by someone else, I ordered a copy of the cookbook for myself. After receiving it, I am ordering another copy as a gift."
5,Nice & Slow...,...is how you must read this author's premiere published work. His thoughts pour into the soul with depth - but you canNOT be rushed! Kudos to Mr. Peaks - I'm looking forward to more!
4,My Thoughts,"This book is good because it seems to bring out the the real life of high school football. The main character is just like a normal teenager. He worries like every normal teen, but never gives up. I would recommend this book to any one who has any slight interest in the game of football."
5,Great book for male teenagers.,"This is such a great book to get male teenagers interested in reading. To read this story, Thomas Cochran puts you into young Travis Cody's mind and feelings as he tracks his final day of high school football. I didn't put this book down until I finished. The story talks about football but deep inside the message of ""I Can Achieve"" and ""Just Do It"" come out in this tale of a young boy entering a mans world. Parents please give this book to your son."
2,A whole pregame show and then some.,"If you are one of those readers whole love sports action and extreme suspense and crack, bam, boom type of action, then this isn't the book for you. Its about what a guy is doing right before a game and what really happens before all highschool football games. But there is no action what so ever.In my opinion, I like action sports with lots of complexity, suspense and a little touch of love. This book has almost none of that to me. This is my opinion though, If you are the person who likes getting ready for a game and the pregame stuff more than the game its self, then this is the right book for you. Not for action lovers. Great plot, and solid the whole way through. I can't wait untill his next book comes out, with his talent of experssing characters like he does, I bet he could make a great book."
2,Reviewed by Eric,"My book ""roughnecks"" was, in my opinion, boring. The whole 248 page boook was one day long. The book describes everything that he thinks and feels. It has no plot, climax or anything like that.The worse part of the book is the ending. The whole book builds up on game then they don't even have the game. Its really dissapointing to find out you don't know who wins the game.The most vivid part of the book is how the auther describes the people. You can picture everyone in the book in your mind. I also think that the conflict is described extremely well. You know how he feels about his rival, Grooms."
2,"Roughnecks, By A. M.","The plot of the story is somewhat interesting. The story does lag in places. Mostly at parts where they have random flashbacks. Some flashbacks make sense, but most don't. If the story is moving along it will eventually stop with a weird flashback that they usually already said a few pages back. Out of ten I would rate this book 4 because I didn't really relate to it and it wasn't a great pageturner. I wouldn't skip hanging out with my friends for it and I definately wouldn't clean the toilets before reading it again."
5,After 5 sessions with this video...I can already see a difference!,"If you are considering purchasing Release, I highly recommend it! It's 55 minutes, but the last 10 or so are spent doing stretches that make you feel totally relaxed after your workout. The workout itself is GREAT. Having bought several yoga/pilates videos over the past few years, Release is above and beyond anything I've bought in the past. For one, I never DREAD doing it; in fact, I find myself looking forward to it. Once I finish...I feel totally refreshed! After using this video 5 times...I can already notice a difference in the toning of my arms, legs and abs. Also, unlike some videos, you never feel annoyed with the instructors. Both Leah and Suzanne are great. Sometimes they chime in with, ""Come on, you can do this!"" and it actually motivates me to hold the poses longer than I may have otherwise.I'm very excited to own this video and I've told all my friends and family about it. This is a must-have!!!"
5,"Great DVD, Different and Refreshing","I use many workout DVDs, I exercise daily and have been involved in many sports such as gymnastics and basketball throughout my life. I enjoy this DVD because it is different and challenging. I was amazed that the first few times performing the workout it seemed difficult but afterward I felt rejuvenated and stretched.The standing series is good for toning your legs and improving your posture I believe. The floor series 1 is pretty challenging as many of the moves are plank moves. In the beginning I couldn't get through the segment. I kept working at them (now I can do the segment without modification) and they have helped my overall arm and shoulder strength immensely. The abs section is good, but my favorite is the stretching and relaxation. It is a nice segment with beautiful music.I would recommend this DVD to anyone, it is relaxing and has helped my posture, strength and flexibility."
5,Next Best Thing to Buying the Answers,"I was scheduled to take the English Praxis after not having taken a college English class since 1992, and was desperate for a study guide. This study guide provided excellent sample questions and tips in the right directions for independent research. Not only did I pass the test, I was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for scoring in the top 15% in the nation!"
3,This Was Worthless,I studied this book (again) for a solid month before taking the Praxis II (for the second time). I actually did WORSE the second time around. My test had about 80 questions on reading passages and it was IMPOSSIBLE to finish it in 120 minutes. I had to guess on the last 8 because time ran out. If anyone has any advice on how to prepare I would greatly appreciate it because this piece of crap obviously did NOT help me!!!
2,Too general,"I purchased this book hoping I would get a detailed list of test items, however I only got a general list of items that you may see on the test. It also came with one full length test that gives you an idea of the testing format and questions that may be asked. I was disappointed that there were not enough specifics. I would recommend you get a student high school literature book and following the content in that book. You would be better off. Stick to the test at a glance on the Praxis website. It gives the same information for free without the full length test."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I just took this test on Saturday, and let me tell you I was extremely let down. I thought buying this book would be the greatest thing since sliced bread and it would be so helpful in my studying, etc. Well, it fails to let you know that one third of the actual Praxis II exam has to do with diagramming sentences and syntax. I know how to write a simple sentence, but I don't remember what a gerund is and where to put the adverb in a sentence when I am under pressure. The practice test in the book focuses mostly on what you have read and how well you can recognize writing styles. I was completely unprepared for the grammar section and it left me feeling like I failed. If you're really worried about the reading list I suggest picking up the Praxis book for the composition part of the test, which was much more helpful than this waste of $20."
3,"good exam, weak elsewhere","I used this book when reviewing for the test I took this weekend. The sample exam was, of course, representative of the actual exam. That was helpful, but I was disappointed that it had only 90 questions instead of the full 120 that are on the exam.Also, while the sample test itself was a good review/practice; I was surprised that there was not more actual review information in the book. The rest of the book is more focused on test taking skills, like how to read multiple choice questions. Let's face it, by the time you get to the educational level to be taking this test, you've taken enough of these standardized exams that you don't really need to figure out how to read and choose an answer on a multiple choice test.So, if you're looking for a good practice exam - this book is great. If you're looking for an overall review or study guide - try another book."
4,The Perfect Pre-test,A fine study guide. It is the best pretest on the market. It is the closest thing to taking the Praxis II test without actually taking the Praxis II test. Or going to a ummm...less than legal site which I hope no future teacher is doing.I would not recomend this guide if you are looking for that last minute cram guide who will tell you who William Shakespear is and how he fits into English Liturature.
2,"nice fabric, incorrect fit","The look and feel of this seat cover is nice. Two issues, however:1)It does not fit as advertised on my truck seats. The bottom seat portion needed to be two sections, and it's one long one covering both driver and passenger seats, even though those two seats can be adjusted back and fourth separately. The backrest cover on the passenger side is made as though there is no fold down center console, so had to tuck a bunch of unusable fabric away behind the seat back on the passenger side. Looks bad. All this despite entering correct model and trim package in the order form.2) The fastening method is awkward, with some loops and lengths of string to secure the covers. There is not near enough of the string supplied; I had to supplement that with twine."
3,"Good, yet just a little disappointed.","Don't get me wrong, this is a good CD. I was just a little disappointed that practically the whole group has changed. I have their first CD and saw them live. I love that first album. This CD is also good to listen to, especially with the collaboration with Michael Doucet. If you are looking for a CD with hints of the traditional Zydeco mixed in with some more contemporary flavor, then you have found the right Jumbalaya with Le Grand Bleu."
5,"Bluerunners new CD, ""Le Grande Blue"" rocks!","While it is not as good as my favorite Bluerunners CD ""To The Country"", it is pretty darn close. I particularly like tracks 6 and 7. Sandra likes number 8. While I normally like their french songs the best, there are quite a few english songs that I like on this CD. The addition of more acoustic guitars really enhance their sound. I highly recommend this new Bluerunners CD and am sure it is a prelude of more good things to come from this great band!"
4,Best CD by the Bluerunners yet!,"After listening to Le Grand Bleu for the first time, I was hooked! I love the albumn. The style and composition are very well done. There are songs both in English and French, so it gives it that real Louisiana touch. And don't worry, there are translations included. There is a little bit of everything for every type of listener. I am so pleased with this purchase. I would encourage everyone to get it as soon as possible!"
3,may not be what you're looking for...,"bought it hoping to get some ""spring"" for my swing. these springs will only compress when you first sit down. once seated, it will not compress/decompress at all.if you want something that will spring WHILE you swing, get springs that stretch apart (as opposed to compress like these do)."
2,Newport News suede boots,"The boots look good but the soles are hard plastic and very slippery, causing me to take a spill in a busy intersection."
4,Clay pack,"This is a great product for clay masks, but I could have used directions. It was truly hit or miss for mixing it just right."
2,Boring and hard to read,"A therapist friend recommended this book but frankly, it is so dense that I found it hard to get through. I feel certain the concepts are good but there must be a better way to learn them than from this turkey."
4,Talk Like an Animal,"What do animals say when they squeek and squawk? Do you suppose that their sounds are like talk? While some of the rhymes are a wee bit contrived, they are a fun way to take a look at animals."
1,don't buy!!!!,"I purchased this microwave and in less than six months it quit working. Seems to be a reoccuring trend. I wish I'd checked out some reviews before buying. Even though a one-year warranty is offered, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,garbage stop selling these,I have baught 2 of these they both are broke they dont heat anything?i advise people to shop around oh and amazon hasnt refunded my money i paid for shipping my first one back?
2,Died after 13 months,We only used it to reheat and it couldn't take the pressure. The door handle was nice. I guess for the price one year was worth it????
1,Very disappointed - died after a year,"I'm on Amazon right now looking for a new microwave because my little red Emerson just died. I've had it just over a year and never had a problem with it til now. Unfortunately, have no idea where the receipt is. Oh well."
3,"Works great, when it works","I loved this microwave and everybody thought it was awesome. Only wish it had a kitchen timer feature! It's nice and powerful and big enough for my large dinner plates. Trouble is that is completely stopped working 6 months after we bought it. The display was shorting out and now it won't turn on at all. I am trying to decide whether to buy a new one because I loved it so much, but I'm not really in the mood to fork over another 60 bucks. Forget trying to get it repaired, you have to pay for shipping to send it in and have it returned to you--$15 each way. Plus all the hassle. For that I might as well just get a new one. ARGH!"
3,Died and revived,"This was a pretty good microwave. The functions were just what I wanted. Unfortuantely it broke after a year of use. It won't even power up. So we bought a new GE one because we can't live with a microwave and we couldn't open up the Emmerson one for a look.A month later, I got a secuirty torx driver bit and opened the sucker up and found that it was only a burned fuse. Replaced it for less than a buck and it's working fine again. Except, we decided to wear out our new one first. The functions on this Emmerson were more convient that our new one..."
1,Died pretty quick.,"Died after around a year -- keypad buttons stopped working and latch went funky. What a waste. I liked it fine up until then. If you buy one, definitely keep the receipt."
1,Poor Quality,This microwave is about the only red one on the market and it is attractive- BUT - it stopped working after 5 months. I have never had a microwave to last this short of a time.
2,It's Okay,"This bat is way over-priced, but I couldn't find anywhere else to buy it. I looked. I hope you have better luck than me. I only bought the bat because I was entering a tournament that used this bat instead of the yellow (skinny) wiffle ball bat. I dislike this bat a lot and prefer the yellow bat. I suppose I did get used to it after a lot of practice, but I'm just not a fan of this bat and the price. This bat really changes the way you hit a wiffle ball (your swing, bat speed and contact)."
5,Thanks -- I needed this! GREAT Xmas gift also,"I would like to write about what this book covers, but that would take too long. What doesn't it cover? It seems to have everything you need to live well and comfortably in your home (or apartment). I like the information on buying stuff (lamps, cookware, furniture, you name it) and on cleaning everything. I fear that I will be referring a lot to the stain removal tips! Giving a dinner party, setting a table, and other niceties also are included. I like the focus on de-cluttering your place and storing our stuff. This is the ultimate reference book for anyone who wants to live better. It's as simple as that. This book is making my Xmas shopping easier, because I will give several copies to friends and family. It's one of those must-haves."
3,Home = a house,"Maybe this book would be more useful for someone living in a house, but most of it doesn't apply to me in my apartment, and that wasn't very evident from what I could see of the shrink-wrapped book. Maybe I'll go back to it in 5 years when I move into a house with more space and more flexibility to make structural changes and get some use out of it then, but for now, it's pretty useless to me.Also, the pages are really low-quality magazine paper and you have to be very careful not to rip or wrinkle them. However, I do like the three-ring binder format -- very cute.Someday this book will be of use to me, but I guess I'm just not settled enough yet."
2,Not her best work,"Meredith Ann Pierce is hands down my favorite author of all time, but I really didn't see the point to this book. The stories were often scattered and irratic, lacking clear plot, character development and resolution. Some stories would have made better whole novels, and others, I am sorry to say, should have been left out of print. Still, I enjoy her writing style and the presentation of worlds in many ways similar to our own but with added elements of magic and fantasy. I hope Ms. Pierce's next endeavor is more along the lines of the Firebringer or Darkangel trilogies. Those were truly great works of literature."
5,Motown Get Down,Great CD with fabulous collection of music. Takes you back to the good ole days of Motown - great driving music!
5,It's the Music!,"Very early in the movie, Standing in the Shadows of Motown, the assertion is made that it was the music, not the performers, that made these tunes great. I was skeptical; after all, great performers did these hits originally. Then the movie started to roll, and we heard modern versions of the numbers, performed by Joan Osborne, Gerald Levert, and others. While they're not the originals, they might well have been! These tunes stand by themselves. And therein lies the point; it WAS, it IS, the music! If you're hesitant to try this CD thinking that it cannot possibly match the original songs, set your doubts aside. You're in for a real treat!"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY MOTOWN FAN,"It was absolutely amazing to hear a group of musicians who, 40 years after the fact, still have that fantastic groove they had when they did the original songs. The pairing of these terrific musicians with a group of today's artists was nothing short of brilliant. The young audience of today, who may never have heard the Motown of the past, will be able to snap their fingers and tap their feet when they hear the likes of Chaka Khan, Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Meshell Ndegeochello, Gerald Levert and other great artists of today, give their interpretation of classic Motown hits, coupled with instrumental tracks that no one has ever heard before this CD. A collector's dream at the very least!!!"
5,Fantastic CD!!!,This is a great CD with performances by the greatest band from the Motown era. You will listen to it over and over.
2,Not at all what I expected,"Two cd's. The first is phenomenal. Various artists doing Motown showed that the instrumentals were as important as the vocalists. Various vocalists were exceptionally pleasing. The second cd. mainly the instruments through out the cd. Just proved that both instruments and vocals are needed. It was boring, spent too much time waiting for someone , anyone to sing. Nothing. So overall, just buy the most recent single cd, make sure there are vocals, Joan Osborne , omg, great, and others."
3,"MusicianShip is tight, the Vocals? that's another story","for me Motown represents History&Arguably the Most Important Music in any Lifetime overall.Every Artist it seemed shinned&Now finally the Great In Studio Group of Musicians who played on more Charted Jams than anybody else have there time.well they had to back up some Great Heavyweights but now they are on top.but the sad thing is that the Vocalists representing here aren't named Smokey,Marvin,or the FOur Tops,etc.. the Vocals overall hurt A Album that would have easily been a Must have.I mean the Music alone is very essential but the Vocalist picked here just don't add anything to the songs nor do they bring the feeling as the Original Artists brought.I like most of the Artists doing there takes on the songs featured here but personally it just doesn't cut it fo rme overall.if this was all Instrumental I'd give it a 5.but with Vocals it brings it way down."
1,Not the original sounds.,They don't sound like the original recording people on those records. This is not the real recordings and they sound very different.
5,"The ""Cool Whip' Song","All this time whenever I heard the ""Cool Whip"" commercial I would sing along and enjoy the music. Little did I know the music was from these musicians on their song ""Cool Jerk"". This CD is just awesome. I got it immediately after seeing the movie and cannot wait to get my hands on the DVD.This is a must have!!!"
5,Great CD package!!!,"I grew up in Detroit and would hang out at the Hitsville building on the way home from school. Later, I met several of the now unemployed Motown muscians. They would tell me their stories and you'd not know if they were true or not. This CD and the DVD that proceeded it brought to light most of what I was told. The performances are fantastic and the songs performed by modern singers are very much like the original hits. The icing on the cake is disc 2 in which the top hits are played by just the muscians with no vocals. It's then that you really began to appreciate how much of your favorite tunes were because of the background music and not the vocals. Listen to the tracks, you find yourself doing your own Smokey Rbinson impression."
4,Cavaliers & Patriots,"Excellent source of land owners in early America. Sure beats having to order from a library, or drive 50-75 miles to a library."
5,Boris'es drone album Heavy but great!,Thank god its not as extreem as some of Merzbow's stuffare you a Boris Fan?Get it!Are you not used to Drone or Doom?Then you better have a big cigar first!This sounds a lot like Sunn o)))Pretty heavyBut strangly beautifull too
1,Jessica McClintock Eau de parfum,This item does not smell like original.This item looks fake and was approved by Dept. store perfume counter.This item comes to you without security wraps.No one should order this or is waist of money.Amazon shouldn't let outsider use them to sell fake items.
5,GOOD SCENT,"I GOT A SAMPLE OF JM, AND LIKED IT A LOT. CITRUS AMD LILLY? A GOOD BALANCE OF SWEET AND TART. THE SEALED BOTTLE COST MORE, BUT IT'S WORTH IT TO KNOW THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. A GOOD EVERYDAY SCENT AND GOOD ADDITION TO THE REPERTOIRE OF PERFUMES."
4,A MEMORABLE CLASSIC FRAGRANCE,"Designer Jessica McClintock is well known for her classic gowns whether the occasion is a cotillion, debutante ball, quinceanera, or a wedding. If a wedding is planned she offers gowns for everyone from the bride to the smallest flower girl.In addition, she presents hand bags, shoes, veils, headpieces, all perfect accompaniments to the chosen gown. Her hallmark is a very contemporary look with old world touches, such as brocades, laces and silk.As noted many of the occasions for which she designs are romantic ones, and the same word, romance, might also be used to describe her fragrance. With notes of white rose, white jasmine and lemon it reminds one of the refreshing, lovely scent of a bridal bouquet. It is light yet lasting."
2,Why so much 916?,"This is just an OK reference book. There is a lot of information missing. The worst part is the amount of space committed to the 916, a car that really wasn't available and no one has."
3,Not what it seems,"This video does run about 45 min. long , but only 23 min. of it is Rainbow Brite. The rest is old cartoons similar to Merrie Melodies. It is cute(the R.B. cartoon), but I was extremely disappointed when my 4 year old daughter and I watched it. I expected that the Rainbow Brite itself was 45 min. long. My daughter doesn't care too much for the ""Bonus Feature"" either. She watched it the first time but now rewinds it to the beginning every time Rainbow is over. So if you would prefer something with only R.B., I'd try to find a video without the ""Bonus Feature"". At least then you'll know how long (or short) the video really is."
2,A General Look,This book provides a good history about all chevrolets and gmc in the years mentioned. However for a person looking for specific information on one particular chevrolet/gmc pickup this is not a good book. All other information is very general and if you have worked with vehicles you already should know it. The book did not satisfy me.
2,Pretty but not very substantive,"I'm not sure what expectations I had for this film when I bought it. I know that the cast, previewed subject matter and film location sounded good. Somehow though, it didn't live up to much of its promise for me. While the cast was filled with some solid professionals, the storyline and the direction--the direction in particular--just didn't cut it. The interaction between characters wasn't credible, probably because of the stilted dialogue. The location of the film - Menorca, I think - was truly beautiful and the best part of the production. Otherwise, I thought this was something that you might expect to see on cable TV's Lifetime channel. Disappointing."
2,A pleasant movie for a Sunday afternoon,"If you are not too busy, and you want something to pass the time, this movie is OK. This is not the type of movie that everyone needs to sit down and watch every second.The pace is slow, the acting is passable, the story goes nowhere for long stretches. You could cut the grass in the backyard and still not miss anything important."
5,Delightful and Moving!,"Other reviewers have so eloquently painted a picture of this movie, that I dare not try to expand. I just want to say that I had no idea what this movie was about when I rented it and spent the afternoon crying and laughing and loving the moment. I am going to buy it now to have in my armery of movies that can move me and make the ugliness of the world disappear for a few hours. Please watch this movie!"
2,Awkward...,"As a fan of a few of the actors involved, the trailer seemed promising, and the idea entertaining enough -- but once I actually started watching, there were points where I literally had to stop and do other things to distract myself from thinking too hard on the awkward presentation.The only way I can think to describe it is to say that scenes and characters sort of stagger around into each other without a concrete sense of what they should be doing or why they're doing it. Through most of the movie I was confused about what I should be feeling about who, and by the time the end rolled around (after two hours), I felt like the film expected me to care more than I actually did.The locations are beautiful, Tucci is great, as usual, and I was glad to see Rhys again, but the movie is lacking overall. Something as simple as smoother dialogue might've bumped it up to 3/5, but as is, definitely a 2."
4,"the movies are good as is the transfers,but set is pricey","the quality of the movies is good,but you can get the same movies in other collections and cheeper."
4,Rally Pack,"This is my second bag of this configuration, most versidial bag for the buck. THe last one lasted me well over 4 yrs of riding. Water proof to a point and spacious could not ask for a better bag for the price."
4,somewhat narrow scope but worth the read,"Somewhat narrow scope basing alot of conclusions on author's analysis of 3 patients, was worth the read though."
3,Hilariously Bad,"Pricelessly awful---buy this for your own MST3K collection, and make your own rude comments! A vampire movie set in 1989, when really big hair and shoulders were still in fashion for women, it details the progress of a sinister, beautiful female bisexual vampire/supermodel ripping her way through the staff of a ""high fashion magazine"". People make a lot of inadvertently funny proclamations about ""art"" and ""love"" and ""desire"". Every time the art director hero changes emotions, he clutches his head (watch for it and toast with beer or cocoa). The Obiwan Kenobi character that saves the day is a bag lady/voodoo priestess (I kid you not). Cheer when the ghastly gofer guy and the receptionist are done in. Mourn the passing of the fashion excesses of the '80's, the last time in history truely bad taste was acceptable and profitable. Enjoy!"
2,It was...interesting,"The only reason I bought it was Susie Sparks has a small cameo. It comes and goes in the blink of an eye and it's pretty wierd. Oh, sorry, review the movie. Well, I haven't watched the rest of it after her cameo. The storyline is a bit confusing."
5,Great!,"Didn't know what I was going to think about this show. In the end it was amazing. If you like shows that make you think, this is the show to watch.The downside/negative: The show wasn't renewed for a second season. Why? I have no idea. It's not because of the acting or story lines. In fact there was a huge outpouring of support to bring the show back; even a website was created to get it back. For whatever reason it wasn't. Don't let that stop you from enjoying season one. Think of it as a really long movie with a bunch of different stories."
3,It was okay,"Tried to get into this series, but it didn't happen. Not sure what was lacking. I'm sure there are many who will thoroughly enjoy this series. Unfortunately, I am not one of them."
1,Waste of time...,"Just bad filmmaking and storytelling, IMHO. I gave up at 13 minutes in because when you have to rely on a device where the characters in a flashback start talking to the audience, something's wrong."
2,Disappointing,This was not what I expected not a good quality movie. The acting was not very good. Better luck next time.
1,Not very recommended - past was better,"Here is a second CD by two young Russian violinists, Ilya Gringolts and Alexandr Bulov. Their first CD was very good, with wonderful playing, interesting repertoirs, and exceptional sound quality by BIS. However, their second CD gives me some doubts. First of all, the choice of works on this CD is rather dull. Secondly, regarding Mr. Gringolts' and Mr. Bulov's violin playing itself - it has downgraded compared to the last CD they made, and it is quite a disappointment.Mr. Gringolts and Mr. Bulov are still under 20's, and one would obviously expect their playing would get better and better as the time goes. At least one would think it should stay at the same level, same caliber. However, it is not the case with this CD. Good work, but still, I look forward to hearing more about them and their future routes."

3,Alright,These dimple bits didn't seem to dimple quite enough. I usually found myself switching back to a regular screw head to go another half a millimeter in.
2,Awful awful awful,"This book and the entire Runaways series was awful! It appears these books were written for mere teeny boppers. VC Andrews is not a teeny bopper writer..she writes to a more adult audience. These books are too short, and what little content they have is meaningless. I miss the styles we had in Heaven and Flowers In The Attic..we need that back!"
3,Short and perdictable,I have read all the books in the orphan series ecept the very last one where all the girls meet. I found the books to short and perdictable they all follow the same story line. I just hope the last one is more dramatic. However good for a short read.
1,This isn't getting any better!,"I am incredibly disappointed with this series, it is so juvenile and it just keeps getting worse. I am an adult here!"
3,Nothing New in the 3rd book of the Orphan series.,"I have read Butterfly, Crystal and Brooke. I beleave that by the time I read the Third Novel I already new what was going to happen to Brooke. It is a given fact that all the girls are going to end up in the same place by the Fourth novel. So realy all the guess work in these books are gone. They all seem to have the same kind of story. New mother needs the Orphan to be just like her. Something goes wrong and they are sent to the same home. I thought that maybe Raven might be a little differant but after I read the preview at the end of Brooke, I think they gave the story away becaus to much of the information was given. I have no desire to read Raven now. I might read Runaways to see what happens to them but at this time it is it for me with the Orphan Series."
