4,"nice, a little slow","I have enjoyed Norah's new CD and would recommend it. I will say that it is slower than her former CD's and tends to make me sleepy, which is either good or bad depending on when I listen to it. And it isn't just mellow like her others, but slower. But her familiar melodies are there, and her smooth voice."
1,four steps backwards...,"Lyrics are not bad, but what happen to the beautiful melodies we are use to?? Seems like the artist and her band are on vacation for too long. If you are a new listener, stick to album 1 or 2 and skip this one all together."
2,No grammy for this one !,The new cd after one week is selling on Amazon for under 7 bocks !That could be a sign that a new cd is a flop !sorry Norah !
3,Problems playing CD on home stereo,"This CD will not play on home stereo, but will play on computer and is capable of being downloaded onto an iPod. Plastic must be too thick for my CD player component of home stereo. Defeats reason for my purchase."
1,Wake me up,"I liked one song - ""Wake Me Up"". This album strays from the entrancing melodies of her previous albums, it's just not pleasing to the ear [at least not to mine]. Even more disappointing was her choice to insert a political statement. Regardless of whether I agree with her political views or not, politics needn't pollute every aspect of life, I wish she'd left that out."
3,Original glories not recaptured,"In ""Not Too Late"" Norah explores New Orleans and folky stylings, but keeps coming back to her original dreamy sound. I *loved* her first album to pieces, honestly, and the second one seemed to me like an exploration of folkier sounds. I was hoping she'd regain that fresher feeling she had in the first album that made me and lots of people want to play it over and over. I have duly added several songs on this album to my ""Soothing"" playlist on iTunes, but there's a fine line between producing a seductively soothing line and doing it in your sleep. I'm still a fan, but hoping for Norah to get better writing, better production, more inspiring life events, or whatever it would take to get her to make a truly outstanding album."
1,Metaphorical Political Statement,"You can't deny this woman has an incredible voice and is a joy to listen to. I was very excited for this album, but was very disappointed. It is a very dark melancholy cd. The lyrics are a catalyst for political metaphors making the album more of a lecture than a listening pleasure. If you read the lyrics, make sure you have someone around to cheer you up after. The only exception on this album is 'Sinking soon'. The combination of the instrumentals and her voice is fantastic, regardless of the lecturing tone of the lyrics. Despite that, Sinking Soon is the only reason to purchase this cd. I look forward to another album of hers but I will not jump into the waters to quickly, I will wait to hear the music and lyrics first to make sure she has created to entertain and not lecture or politicize."
1,Not Too Good,"First of all, I really like Norah Jones. I mean, I REALLY like Norah Jones. She's the most unique female pop vocalist to come along in 20 years or so, and that's saying a lot. But ""Not Too Late"" is a big ol' snooze. There's not a single song with a hook you can hold on to, nothing here you want to hear again, nothing engaging or even entertaining. Given that she's written most of the songs, perhaps this is the real Norah Jones. As a big fan who's adored her previous two albums, I sincerely hope not."
2,Wait! It's not too late,"If you're buying this C.D because you loved her first, Come Away With Me, and are hoping that it compensates for her second album, Feels Like Home; DO NOT buy her latest release. However, if you are intrigued by her artistic progression you may enjoy It's Not Too Late.I personally felt as if I were listening to some scary soundract of a carnival film during the first half of the C.D and just didn't enoy the rest. I was really hoping that this would be a rivival of her multi-grammy winning unique sound. But not to be too critical of her. There is no doubt that she is a courageously talented women who isn't in the business for popular approval but rather her own artistic indulgence."
3,Where Did the Soul Go?,"I have been a NoJo fan from the beginning. I can listen to her first two CDs over and over and not get tired of hearing her soulful soft voice. But I must say I was a bit disappointed with her latest album. Aside from Rosie's Lullaby, it was, well, boring. It's not that the songs are bad, but they seem to be missing the passion Norah has portrayed through her previous albums. It is a good background album, maybe at work or during a dinner party, but not if you're looking to be inspired. Not bad, but not great either. Where is the Norah Jones we know and love?"
1,Her first two CDs SPECTACULAR...then this?,"What happened? After the magic and depth and beauty of Norah Jones' first two CDs, this CD disappoints to the point of being traumatizing. I LOVED her earlier work, worshipped it. I actually was so upset after listening to Not Too Late (just NOTHING, nothing going on, nothing at all) that I couldn't play my CD player for a few days...when I put her Come Away With Me on, everything was restored again. Someone better get the real story out of Norah - something happened, something definitely happened. Unless the first two were just magic miracles and that's all we can expect from this talented star."
2,Truly Disappointing,"I own all of Norah's CDs and this is, by far, the most disappointing. She is a very talented performer/singer and this is just not her best work. The entire CD is quite forgettable. I have played it numerous times and quite honestly don't even find myself paying any attention to it.Perhaps this will begin a change in direction that will lead to more stellar artistry that she is fully capable of producing. All artists eventually produce sub-standard material during their career and I am not completely giving up on Ms. Jones yet... However, I probably would not have purchased this CD had I heard it prior to purchase. I pre-ordered it from Amazon before it was even released."
3,Kind of a disappointment,"I really liked her first two albums, but this one just didn't grab me. Am I missing something?"
4,Can't understand the negative comments,"This is a strong effort - influences such as Tom Waits & Randy Newman really shine through in the songs. Numbers like ""Sinking Soon"" and ""My Dear Country"" show such growth as a writer. And as a singer, she is without fault. If it's not as easy for some folks as ""Come Away With Me"" was to get into, it's also far more mature. I knew when I bought that first album she was one to watch. She still is."
2,Not Too Late,"If you are a Norah Jones fan, you should buy ""Not Too Late"", but don't expect it to be on par with her previous efforts. If you are not that familar with Norah Jones' music, don't buy ""Not Too Late"", go for an earlier release. ""Not Too Late"" has flashes of the Norah music I really enjoy, but for the most part it is uneven and disappointing."
4,Reviews on track,"After reading a number of reviews on her new CD, I was interested in hearing it and evaluating her new direction. Happy to say, I was very pleased with the results!"
1,"Great, Good, Bad","I loved her first two albums -- 'Come Away with Me' is amazing. I used to play it so often that my male friends started to give me a hard time about it. I could die for the title 'Shoot The Moon'. I also liked her second album 'Feels Like Home'. But this one is simply bad. If I can get myself to give it another try and put it in my CD player, I always end up utterly dissappointed."
1,"Somebody ""Wake *ME* Up""","If you've heard Norah's last 2 albums, then you've heard this one too. Very boring and uninspired. Lack of range and lack of emotion. There's nothing new or fresh about her new album at all. Everything Norah's done has been done over more than twice. She should've gotten in touch with Timberland and The Neptunes and they would've produced something for her that would've been much better. This is lullaby music all right. It made me extremly sleepy."
1,Not Grammy material!,"Oh, my goodness! What happened to Norah Jones' jazzy side? The first 2 songs on this album had me sleeping! I thought after listening to the entire album a second time around I would enjoy it, but in fact, I despised this album even more. What a waste! This album isn't anywhere near Grammy contention!"
2,Yawn,"Beautiful above average singer - fantastic keyboards - lousy material. If you're sleep deprived, this should send you into lala-land for at least a couple days."
1,blech blech and more blech,"I have two other albums by Norah Jones and I love her voice. When I found out that this CD was coming out I bought it right away and was so excited to pop it into the player. I will never listen to it again! It is cynical and depressing. She must have just gotten dumped by a boyfriend or betrayed by a friend. If you have a miserable life and want company, then this is the CD for you. And that's too bad, because her voice is fantastic. I wish I didn't know what the words said, because then maybe I could at least enjoy the sound of her voice. This might make me hesitant to listen to her first two albums. If she is smart, she will stop production and issue an apology."
1,"Bland, Boring, Blah",This cd is so bland! Every single song sounds the same. It's almost so bad that you think there is just one continuous 45 minute song! Her voice is not that special either. It's almost like listening to Patsy Cline on downers. She makes Enya sound like a rock star. At least Enya does vary the sound SOME. That album cover makes me cringe. Could she have chosen an uglier frock? The best song isn't that great. She says over and over...It's not tooooo late....ooooohoooooh....it's not to late...for loooove! I think she knows that people will buy this cd no matter how bad it is. She needs to try a little harder and spice it up a little.
2,Am I the only one bored with this?,"Based from the other reviews, obviously not. Well, at least we'll always have come away with me. P.S. I don't care whether or not you agree with my opinion"
3,Not as good as her first two,"Norah is always good, but this album isn't up to her previous work. Still, I would buy it again."
4,Not Too Shabby,"There's one bluesy song on this CD, Sinkin' Soon, that I picks me up when stuck on the freeway."
5,Time to Chill,I just picked this one up and random not knowing anything about the CD. I am a fan of Norah Jones' music and this is a very nice CD. It has a very bluesy/jazzy feel which she is known for. This is the perfect chill/lazy day CD.
2,Only if you're melancholy...,"Same nice voice and piano but the music is sad, slow and a bit of a downer. No songs stood out on the album as memorable. I loved her first one and liked #2 but will listen more carefully before I buy #4."
3,"Insipid and inoffensive, uninspired and uninspiring","That's about the highest praise I can muster for this effort. It isn't that it's BAD, but it just never achieves ""lift off.""I wish I could wax enthusiastic, but after quite a few listens at this point, I don't think my opinion is likely to change appreciably.Time for Ms. Jones to find her passion. It isn't evident on this CD."
3,Not All That Accesible,The first time i saw Norah Jones was on the David Letterman show and thought she was going to be very successful. She was. I didn't like the second album as much as the first and don't like the third as much as the second. I think she oughta do better material.
1,I can't believe how disappointed I am!!...,"I was so excited to see Norah had a new CD coming out that I pre-ordered it. BIG mistake! I'm not doing that again with NJ. The first album was incredible, the second almost as good but this third one I'm having trouble even getting through the whole thing. I like mellow music but this is ridiculous, I'm falling asleep! I am making myself listen to the album a few times, but besides a couple of songs that are just ok, I am not really enjoying it. I'm fighting myself to keep from forwarding to the next track in mid-song. Most of the songs sound the same and I can't tell one from the next. To the reviewers who insist you have to read the lyrics... Yes lyrics are important but this is music, if I can't bare to listen to it, what's the point? The magic of the first album is no where to be found in this one.My advice: Listen to it before you buy it because obviously there are some people who love this cd, maybe you are one of those few."
2,Snoozer,"I couldn't agree more with the preceding two star reviewers. I was expecting so much more than this monotonous, quite frankly, boring album. There's really nothing to sink your teenth into. A couple of the songs at the end have some promise, but as a whole the album falls flat, lacking emotion or depth or variety. Her voice does sound good, but there seems to be some disconnect, as if she sleptwalked through it."
2,Disappointed,"Shame on you Nora. I love her voice, have totally enjoyed her previous albums and this one comes as a very big disappointment. Having a poilitical opinion is great and is admirable because it indicates an awareness and concern for a person's country. Perhaps those views would best be shared in a different venue rather than imposing them upon people who purchase music for the sake of enjoyment.The songs became monotonous due to there sameness in tone, tempo, and to add to this, the words were difficult to decipher. Good thing lyrics were included.I am a Nora Jones fan and will continue to listen to everything she produces with the hope that soon she will reclaim her unique style that endeared her initially."
2,Not worth the money,"I just bought this album a few days ago and enjoyed 2 songs out of 13 on the album. The lyrics are boring and not catchy at all. I let the whole album play and it just became more like background noice. This is nothing compared to her old album ""Come Away with me."" There are two good songs on the album, which I suggest you should just purchase the singles of the two songs, if possible. The first song ""I've been thinking about you,"" has a very catchy beat and good lyrics. The second song I like on the album is ""Rosemary's lullaby,"" which pulls you in when you hear the lyrics and the beat. However, as stated before, the rest of the album became like background noise."
4,Quality,"Cant really hate Norah's music if you tried. If youve already listened to some older material than this isnt much of change. Five years in and the music she puts out is still quality. The tracks are smooth and melodic, recommend for anyone that appreciates good music. A decent third album for Norah.-Shaheem"
5,Norah's Soothing Music Notes,"The first time I listened to Norah's new CD Not Too Late, I was a bit surprised at how different it sounds when compared to her very first hit CD Come Away. A part of me wants to hear music exactly like Come Away but another part of me appreciates Norah's music no matter what the underlying melody sounds like. Not Too Late is very much like her sophomore CD Feels Like Home. I just love her voice, her acoustics, and her band because the music they make together is meaningful and satisfying."
1,doesn't it all sound the same?,"she has a beautiful voice - no question about it... but somehow I think that all the newcomer magic that surrounded her first album is suddenly gone and she hasn't been able to transcend... with a rare exception throughout the album (i.e. ""sinkin' soon""), she pulls the same notes, same inflections, same dynamics, same attitude, same instrumentation, same arrangements, perhaps the same background voicings and harmonies... just new lyrics and therefore new songs... but not new music"
3,same soup,"I bought this for my wife and she likes it OK. To me all 3 CDs sound like one song, except ""Don't know why"" from her first album ""Come Away With me"", which is the wonderful timeless classic that made her famous. If this is your first Norah purchase, buy ""Come Away With Me"" instead, which is my wife's favorite CD of all times."
5,Different from the rest,"I See alot of mixed reviews about This album, and you know, I really like it alot.It's so different than her other albums, I think her voice shows some really strong talent in this album and she really proves to her fans she's capable of any style of music and can make it work.If your a Norah Fan, and are willing to listen with an open heart and mind, just give it a chance, I feel it's so worth it.."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping that the negative reviews were not correct but I have to agree with them. This cd is such a disappointment after years of waiting. Too mellow, too low key, too one sided. We know from live performances and collaborations (such as with the Peter Malick Group) that Jones is not a one-trick-pony and that there is so much more potential. Why she chooses to go the safe route on her own cd's is a mystery. This cd is not horrible but it's not great either. I'm not in a hurry to listen to it again and that's a shame."
2,Disappointed,"I love Norah Jones. And the couple of songs she did write on her previous albums were actually pretty good. With this album she writes or co-writes all the songs. And frankly, the melodies are such a disappointment. That's the hook that grabs me and pulls me in to her music and it is just not there on this album. I listened to this cd over and over. Gave it a rest and then came back to it hoping, praying it would jump off the player at me, and nothing. I was very hopefull for her songwriting and was wishing her all the best, but this one goes to the bottom of the stack for me."
3,Not too Late - Norah Jones,"I love Norah Jones and think she is an amazing talent. The 1st CD, Come Away with Me, is a tough act to follow, even for the artist herself. Not Too Late is just a ho-hum (slightly boring) representation of the style and selection she usually does. I would love to hear a fresh and new compilation of music such as the impact and WOW factor of her 1st CD. I would not have purchased this product had I listenend to it first."
2,It's true - this album stinks.,"Like everyone else, I love Norah Jones' voice - but the lyrics on this album are just dumb. Lesson for those musicians out there - it's a bad idea to let your boyfriend produce your record. Skip this one - buy her earlier stuff."
3,Not too great,"I was really bummed after listening to this CD a few times.I have been a HUGE fan of Norah's from the first time that I heard her voice. I still love listening to COME AWAY WITH ME, and FEELS LIKE HOME. These are 2 of the very few albums that I can just sit down and listen to all the way through--they have always moved me and I have found so many of the tracks on these past albums so musically powerful.But, as I said, I have found this new one to be a slight disappointment. The lyrics lack any complexity whatsoever, several of the songs are actually redundant, and I find it to be pretty much uninspiring all around.I have always defended Norah in the past when my friends and family have labeled her as ""background music--"" but I'm afraid that I would definitely (although reluctantly) put this album into that category..."
3,"Not her best, but still an interesting album to listen to","Norah Jones is quite an interesting new talent who captured my attention with her first major album, Come Away With Me. Not Too Late has a somewhat different sound, with all of the songs having been authored (or co-authored) by Norah herself. The album is somewhat darker in tone, and is not what I consider her best work. Nonetheless, it is quite good, and an interesting album to listen to."
3,Spare us the marketing tricks,"Four stars for the CD, two stars for the marketing. I decided I wasn't going to make the same mistake I did on Feels Like Home, and just bought the CD this time around. The DVD wasn't worth it the first time (I watched it once), and judging by the description the DVD isn't worth it the second time either. Besides Norah looks just fine to me on a field of red. You have to love these little marketing tricks. I suppose this is Blue Note's way of keeping you from downloading the music. If they really want to treat you, they would combine her CD with a DVD of live performances, then it might justify the $20 price tag."
2,Not up to Snuff,I was disappointed in this CD. The CD was monotonous and all of the songs were slow. No variety. It's not the Norah Jones that I have enjoyed for the last few years.
1,Amazing ?!,"Once more, I find it amazing how you put a cute girl behind the microphone, let her breathe in a supposed sexy and sultry voice some superficial words and how massive success just comes.Even worse, the music is not pop music, but muzak, and they absurdly call this jazz !"
1,Disappointed,"I don't usually review music on Amazon as it is clearly such a matter of taste, but since I am (maybe ""was"") a huge Norah fan I pre-ordered this just assuming I would love. I did not. After three attempts to listen to it this CD has been put in a cabinet and forgotten. The Little Willies CD was great, so if you haven't heard that and are dying for some good Norah give that a try. This was just ""ugggh""."
2,Disappointing!,"This collection of Norah Jones songs, all written by her (I believe), left much to be desired. The ""honey-ed"" voice did not come through clearly, so many of the lyrics were lost or indistinct. If you, like myself, were enchanted by her first efforts and started a collection, you will be sadly disappointed. I have gone back to listening to the bell-like tones of Sarah Brightman and recommend that others choose another favorite artist."
3,BmusicL,"Not Too Late would be fine if it were Norah's first, but I'm afraid we have all been spoiled by her first two efforts. Tracks lack the verve and charm of her past work, and lyrics are sometimes trite and colorless. Even after repeated listenings, I can't get past the ""3."""
4,Depends on your expectations,"I love Norah Jones--her voice and musical arrangement is extremely appealing. Last night, though, my husband and I listened to this entire CD for our Saturday night date (a great cheap date, by the way: go choose a CD together and then listen to the whole thing, discussing each song) and I gained a whole new impression. Each song on this CD sounds much the same as the others, and I found the lyrics of only three songs to be interesting. I still love Norah, but primarily as background music."
2,another nora jones,"Norah Jones and her music is not my faorite. The was purchased for my Mother, who likes her music."
1,Depressing and Political - big dissapointment,I have Norah's first two CDs as well as a DVD of one of her performances. I loved her previous work. Now she comes along with a depressing series of songs and bashes the President and the results of the last election. Yuck - I don't need this in the music I buy to enjoy and relax to. It will be very hard for me to buy any future CDs from Norah Jones.
1,Why do people even bother,Norah Jones along with Macy Gray have the worst voices I've ever heard. There's nothing that Jones does to distinguish herself the same sounding songs over and over. With that voice I'm not quite sure how she has accomplished 3 cds already. It's shocking really and there are so many female artists that have better voices then what she has so do yourself a favor never buy a cd of Nora Jones unless you want to use it as a coaster. Otherwise she's just not worth listening too.
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz......good substitute for Ambien,"This collection of lethargic crud is her worst yet...which isn't saying much. I'm listening to it as I scribble this ""review"" and I'm already nodding off this listless, limp, tasteless and unmusical album.I can't believe pop tastes have gotten so bad as to make this CD Amazon's second (or is it first?) most pre-ordered. Gawd, we're all doomed!!"
1,Why do musicians think we care about their political views?,"I own all Norah Jones' CDs and DVDs - I think she is extremely talented. But I really do not care what musicians think about politics, they are far from being well informed. If Norah Jones wants to use her music for political attacks, it's her right of course. But I have the right to vote with my dollars and add her to list that includes Dixie Chicks, Mel Gibson, etc. - they will not get any more money from me.Alice Cooper said it best:""If you're listening to a rock star in order to get your information on who to vote for, you're a bigger moron than they are. Why are we rock stars? Because we're morons. We sleep all day, we play music at night and very rarely do we sit around reading the Washington Journal."""
1,It's toooooooooooooo late,"You would think NJ would of learned a little something from the dixie chix, to bad I liked NJ before but the political rhetoric I get tired of. I wish she would just ""Shut Up & Sing"""
1,It is WAY Too Late.... what a disappointing album from such a talented singer,"I pre-ordered this album the moment I heard that Norah had her third CD coming out, and couldn't wait to get it. My favorite album was her first. The second was good, but not quite as great as the first one. My husband thinks all of her singing is totally depressing and that she's suicidal, or if she's not, he is whenever I put her CD's on!!!Well, having now listened to ""Not Too Late"" three times to see if it was maybe music that had to ""grow on you"" I now have to concur with my husband - it is very depressing, and if you're on the edge, this could push you over!I'm so disappointed because I just love her first album so much, and this is just SO AWFUL!!I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - and certainly nobody that's depressed to begin with!!"
2,huh?,"couldnt get past the first five or six songs, and I LOVE Norah Jones. Kept 'fast forwarding' thinking maybe it was me. They just didnt reach. There was a kind of 'nothing special' effect. Maybe the success of the first two albums went to her head. Maybe someone so young should try singing duets with more experienced and seasoned singers, it might not be very 'original' but it would certainly take her from a very talented apprentice to maybe being a true master. Nora you are so young, and I believe that you are a National Treasure, take your time."
1,Over-rated,"I think Norah Jones' second and third album prove that she was overrated. The lady cannot write songs. And her vocals are limited. Even the songs that she wrote on her first album weren't that good. As far as I am concerned, the only reason the first album was a success was because all of the good songs were written by someone else. They should've given the Grammy for Best Album to Bruce Springsteen's ""The Rising"" instead."
1,Another dud.....,Her first recording was her best. It had more of a Jazz feel to it. This one is just another dud. I'll give it a few more listens to see if it grows on me but I doubt it.
1,What a disappointment,"My wife is a big fan and we've seen Norah a couple of times in concert... I'm really regretting buying this, as we both hate it.A few of the songs are making none to subtle jabs at Bush, which I find grating and tired. The guy has like a 20% approval rating (ie. we get it, really!) Its been done before by too many artists and brings nothing to the music. If you happen to be one of the few remaining George W. Bush fans, don't worry, NJ is basically mumbling through the whole CD, so its unlikely that you'll understand what she's saying anyway.Hopefully buyers will ignore this review when I put our CD up for sale."
2,Not the Norah I expected,"I eagerly awaited the release of this CD but was sadly disappointed by the somber somewhat downbeat tone of the songs. I kept thinking ""maybe the next song"" will pick up but, no luck. I listen to Norah Jones as a melodic, relaxing respite from an otherwise hectic day. I didn't get that on this CD."
5,Wonderful CD!,"I've been listening to Norah Jones' ""Not Too Late"" in my car since it arrived in my mailbox. Her voice, her delivery, the blending of voices, the selections she wrote or co-wrote...well, they are beautiful. Thank you, Norah Jones."
2,Boring and useless...,"Unfortunately, this CD is much below all what one could expect from Norah Jones. Except the cover, nothing is worth remembering."
5,Soft Jazz,"I might have to purchase another one of these, because I keep listening to it. I love Norah's voice."
3,"Good, but not her best.","While ""okay"", believe Norah's other CDs are superior to this one. Seems like this is really a re-hash of the same type of stuff. Was looking for her to broaden her horizons."
2,just ok,"Norah Jones has talent,but has settled for the Starbucks format of Music that fits into a certain segement which for the most part just blares out at you,but none of the tracks are memorable. another well-Produced Album, but lacking big time in the sgonwriting department&Vocally Norah Jones is aight,but nothing ever stands out. alot of this album sounds just like her previous two albums. formula is cool,but Norah Jones needs to be challenged a bit more."
5,"So good, I still remember it 20 years later..","I was ten years old when this book was read to me. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Podlinski, took a half hour out of every day to read a chapter to the entire class. My classmates and I eagerly awaited each new day just to hear more of the story.I can't remember much of the actual storyline. I only found it again because I did a google search for ""nickel milk book depression."" I really only remember how much i liked it and how much I liked the main character.I can't give a plot synopsis. I can tell you that when I heard this story, narrated by my teacher, I thought that this book was better than anything else. I would've given up recess to stay and listen to more.I'm so happy I found it again."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"If you enjoy cooking, and wish to establish yourself further in the trade (as an amateur or professional) this book is imperative. I've used and adapted more recipies from this book than any other I own. Bertolli strives to describe what you should be looking for, smelling, and feeling in a product. However, you'll find his writing much easier to deal with if you've already a background in the kitchen, or have some basic knowledge of fundamental culinary techniques. Overall, this is a fantastic book, particulary the chapters on Tomatoes and Balsamico. Enjoy!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm really disappointed with the typesetting and editing of this book. There is no distinction between the *recipes* and the prose and the whole thing is so flow-of-consciousness random that I have no idea why anything is where it is. It wouldn't have been bad as a Kindle book for 9.99 but no one should have to pay more than that for it. I'm looking up how to send it back or sell it. I don't feel like wasting time guessing where the end of the recipe is to continue reading his pretentious ""meditations"" on food."
5,"Beautiful Book, Interesting Reading","This book was inspiring to read. I don't watch much TV, so I'm not up on celebrity chefs, but the author's writing style was quite readable, beautiful, and invited one to enter the kitchen with love and respect for the ingredients, the process, oneself and the diners. The recipes are for basic foods, though I have to admit, I enjoyed reading the book, rather than making each recipe. So much of cooking at home can be repetitive and uninspired. I enjoyed the encouragement to take the whole process up a level, not by complicating gourmet cuisine, but by basic cooked-from-scratch traditional foods."
3,"A great book to read, not to cook from","I pretty much read this book cover to cover, and in that context would give it four stars, but as a practical cookbook for the home cook, would give it two stars. It carries with a bit of pretension and impracticality for the home cook. Still, for those interested in tomatos 12 ways.. then pick it up for a read, and for the adventurous.. try a recipe or two."
3,"Good pads, buy for your B&D scrubber","If you're like me and couldn't find the accessory pads for your B&D; Scumbuster in your store then buy them through Amazon's partner when you order your Scumbuster. Pretty simple--they do the job, last a reasonable time through multiple jobs. I bought both these large ones and smaller ones that can be used on pans and smaller items. I mainly use the large ones for cleaning the shower stall floor, glass doors and a separate tub. Think about whether you really need the smaller ones or not for other jobs.Also be advised if you have to order the pads through an Amazon partner like I did there are pricey shipping charges. But again, if you can't find the pads in your local store it's worth it."
5,A beautiful pictoral guide to golf in Ireland,"This is a beautiful ""coffee table"" book, full of pictures and descriptions of the great golf courses throughout Ireland. The pictures give a good idea of what the courses are like, and the descriptions, although generally brief, are entertaining. It is the perfect book for anyone who has or is plannning a golf trip to Ireland. If only it were still in print..."
2,my review,"I'm a huge batman fan, and I expected this toy to be amazing.Unfortunately, this r/c ""tumbler"" is not really playful. The front steering wheel doesn't turn really well. It nudges 10 degrees to the left or to the right. Remember the Austin Power movie when Austin was stuck in the hallway with that cart? That's how I felt when I tried turning this batmobile. In addition, the jumping feature has not worked for me. I read the manual on how it works. At this moment, I still have not made it jump.On other hand, the sculpture is superb! nuff said.The remote control is cheap like any other stock remote control.This product is not worth $40. Fortunately, I purchased this unit for $20 during the Thanksgiving holiday sale. However, the 9.6 V Battery (sold separately) is another $20.I give this product 2 stars."
1,Do not buy this toy,"Luckily I had one of the 9.6 volt batteries around and saved myself 20 dollars, after placing the battery in which is no easy task, he has to walk behind it to get it to go, the range is terrible, why is there no antenna on the vehicle also? Too bad I threw the box away Xmas morning, now I'm out 49.99. Live and learn"
2,Sad on Christmas,"My son is a total ""Batman Begins"" fan. Everything on his Xmas list was ""Batman"" which inlcuded this car. It was very disappointing for him to open this car and find out that the additional battery which is packed by ""Tyco"" was not included. The 9V battery is easy to get and also packaged so that you know you will need it - but otherwise a major waste of time. The search for this other battery is something I would not recommend for another parent to endure. Best advise - DON'T GET IT!"
1,Piece of Junk,"My son received this car for Christmas and I was appalled. Amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery, which was no problem getting. But as for the 9 V Turbo battery and charger, good luck finding that. I bought it when it was on sale for $19.99 and the original price said it was $59.99, so I thought that I was getting a deal. HUGE MISTAKE! I didn't know that I would have to purchase an additional $20 battery. NO WONDER WHY IT WAS ONLY $19.99! ITs a piece of junk. I also got the batboat, but I'm afraid to see what that might need. My advice, DONT GET IT!"
3,batman begins to the end,i dont see what all the problum is with not geting a battery i live in Germany for now and my son got this for Christmas and i did find some batterys on line and the PX here had some on 1/2 price my son haves fun playing with the car his dog likes to play to it all works good for us
1,Battery-Mobile??,I made the mistake of buying this toy for a friend's son - without reading the comments and reviews first! WHAT A MISTAKE! I agree totally with the other comments. A $30.00 toy that REQUIRES a $20 battery? Amazon recommended a $6.29 battery pack - that was completely deceiving. VERY disappointed.
4,Batman Remote Control Car,"This car was bought for my sons 7th birthday. It was sort of expensive for the size as I imagined it to be a lot bigger. However having said that my son has loved this car. It is speedy, does amazing turns and he has spent hours playing with it. Wish the batteries would last longer before having to recharge for 12 hours but there again it makes us have a break and move onto something different."
4,"Works well, but exorbitantly priced","This case had been great and kept my Macbook Pro in pristine condition (at least the outside of it; recommend some wipes for cleaning the inside). Unfortunately the $160 price tab makes me feel like it should have come from Hermes or Gucci.The case itself is sturdy and fits the MP very well - the only complaint I have so far is that one of the screw holes for the DVI adaptor is blocked when the case is on so if you want to use a second monitor or output to a projector you've got to fold back the bottom part of the case.If the price were closer to $80-100 I would wholeheartedly recommend this case for its great looks, snug fit, and good protection; $160 is too much for what you get."
4,Politics and Change in the Middle East (10th Edition),"Great Book, helps out with my POL 310 class. I like how it tells about the history, and also talks about what we are seeing today."
1,Do not use this book for any class!,The authors of this text allow their bias to infiltrate the way that information is presented. At times using offensive language and presenting false information. As an undergrad student I couldn't believe that this type of textbook was allowed to pass as an instructional tool for Professors to use. I was lucky enough to have an instructor that presented material that opposed what the authors of this text represented. Any Professors thinking about using this text for a class I think you would be doing your students a great disservice by doing so. Do not use this textbook!
3,The price is right for what you get,"Drummer here -- and I got tired of turning my head to sing into a mike on a boom stand so started looking for a headset mike.Frankly, I got this one because it was the cheapest offering from a name brand provider and it had the kind of around-the-head-and-over-the-ears mount I was looking for.All in all, it's good enough. It's very heavy on mid-range (which you can EQ around, but you'll need to) and I was surprised at how susceptible it is to feedback from the monitors (not horrible, but definitely worse than an SM58).On the plus side, it wears very comfortably and the boom arm stays where you put it (and I definitely move around for a drummer). It would be nice if it had a on/off switch, perhaps on a belt-clip pack. As it stands, the belt-clip works well at keeping the cable out of your way."
4,Nice Headset,This headset is very clear and has a lot of drive. It also fits very comfortable after a few adjustments. I would have given it 5 stars if it had an on/off switch.
5,Great little mic for the money,"Sure, this is not the Sure SM58. But it is so close in sound quality. The SM58 is a bit warmer but I found it requires more ""e q""ing. I'm a singing drummer and recently bought this because I was sick of sticking a mic in front of me and having to play like a robot. I put this on (the build quality and fit are both awesome), plugged it in, and sang. It sounded great even before adjusting the levels. It is a bit dry without effects though. But for the price, you can not beat this mic.To be clear, I bought the xlr version, got an xlr extension cable and I plug this directly into the soundboard. I don't have the money for the wireless systems yet."
5,Excellent,"Great music and excellent recording! I am not a fan of live shows however the music was great, good choice of songs and high quality recording for a live show! I would definitely recommend it!"
5,Great multi-purpose knife,"I have had this knife (in addition to the 15 piece set) for almost a year. The blade is still very sharp and cuts tomatoes, chicken, pineapples, etc. all with ease. This is a great multipurpose knife and I use it all the time. Well weighted and a nice grip. I have found that a Santuko and a paring knife are sufficient for most of my cutting needs."
2,Third time's a.....charm? [Calhalon's great CS],"[EDIT: After talking to a Calphalon rep (who was as surprised as I was,) they promptly provided an RA and shipped out a new one. No problems so far, though the blade is a little less than I bargained for. Revised rating - 3 1/2]Like the reviewer below, I had spectacular luck with my new Santoku blade on the first two veggies I cut. By the third, however, it seems the Calphalon ran out of steam and I was squashing tomatoes instead of slicing through them.I'm not sure if there's a quality control issue with these, but I'll be returning mine and going with a higher-end Wusthof for a few dollars more."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","I had been wanting a good santoku knife for a while when I ran across the Calphalon Contemporary 7 inch Santoku. I figured for 40.00 I should at least try this knife. So I did. I love the size, the weight, the grip and even how it cuts when it is sharp. I have to sharpen this darn knife WHILE I'm using it or it goes so dull it's about as effective as a butter knife. When I first got it, it was razor sharp. I used it twice. Twice meaning, I cut 2 limes up for drinking Corona's. On the third lime it was dull."
4,first review incorrect,The first review for this book is incorrect. Bachelor By Design is Trace Callahan's story. The Bachelor Trap is Jake Callahan's story.
5,spaceballs,"A Mel Brooks classic. Give it a 10 on the laugh meter. The cast is great fun. John Candy stole the. Show as Barf the dog boy partner. All in all a great way to enjoy an evening with friends and family. ""May the Schwartz be with you""."
4,"Love this movie, not really worth the double-dip if you own the Mel Brooks Collection, tho...","This is one of my favorite movies and I've owned it on multiple formats, including VHS, DVD (twice) and now Blu-Ray (twice). Unfortunately, this version of the movie (as gorgeous as it looks), lacks much new content; just a new retrospective documentary.Otherwise, if you don't own this at all on Blu-Ray, go ahead and get this one"
3,Spaceballs on Blu-Ray. That's it.,Really nothing to write home about for extras. Just the movie on Blu-Ray. If you have another version save your money.
5,Your schwartz is as big as mine,"Spaceballs, the movie! Merchandizing! Just love this film and had to get it on Blu-ray for the better sound and the additional extras. Do watch the movie and then watch it again with Mel's commentary."
4,Not for 8 year olds.,Loved this movie when it was broadcast on T.V. Very funny parody.Tried to watch it with my 8 year old grandson because he loves Star Wars. WAY TOO MANY swearwords in the uncensored full length version.
4,Funny,"Spaceballs is a very funny spoof on Star Wars. Mel Brooks does it again. However, it is marked as PG, but it should be PG-13. I would have it in my video collection."
5,Hello Marlene.....I'm Sharlene!....,"My sister and I used to watch our VHS version of this practically every weekend back in primary school.We had only seen Spaceballs before we really got into watching Star Wars properly. So when i saw those 1998 rereleased ones i laughed quite heartily.Highlights include the 3 minute arrival of Dark Helmets Starship,President Scroob being beamed when it was only next door,Dark Helmet & Lonestar's battle before knocking out the boom mike operator,Prince Valium, Pizza The Hutt, and the little Top Hat N Tailsdancing Alien.Its a top movie, great for a laugh, and with all the Star Wars hoopla at the moment, why not watch a film that makes fun of it all."
5,"Mel Brooks, gotta love him",I want every Mel Brook movie eve made. He is hilarious! His movies are a wonderful cure for the blues.
5,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE!!!,"This movie was just outstanding. It was really funny because it was so close to the movie they impesonated, ""Star Wars"". The funniest parts were when Lone Starr(Luke) met Yogurt(Yoda) and he told Lone about the Shforce(Force). Also another part that was funny was when Dark Helmet(Darth Vader) tells Lone Star that he was his father's uncle's nephew's roomate in college. That was the best! Highly recommended!!!"
3,"Funny, but crappy.","This movie was very funny i have to admit, but i think the acting was about as bad as the lunch lady's gooolash crap. The story-line was ok, not too bad, but they could have done a better job. The graphics/visuals were sooo fake, for example, at the end where the alien-type thing comes out of the guys stomach was about as fake as those ""Hulk Hands"". The only thing that was good about this movie was the mocking of star-wars and all of the funny jokes. But they could have done a way better job on the acting, and of course the visuals/graphics, but it was made in the 80's, so it's understandable."
2,Quite Funny,It contains a few funny jokes and moments but is a bit thin on plot. This movie is a complete spoof of the star wars movie and has all the main characters who look nothing like the real versions and have completely different names.
3,"Arena QB Shawn Withy-Allen's favorite: ""What's the matter Col. Sanders, chicken?""","""May the Schwartz be with you"", Pizzathe Hut, ""Funny, she doens't lookshrewish""...I could go on. The bestMel Kaminsky, er, ah, 'Brooks' has everdone. Candy steals the show and BillPullman is fine as well. Daphnie isREALLY FINE!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Your helmet is so big and round...,"Yes Druish princesses are always attracted to money and power and I have both!This was the first Mel Brooks movie, I had ever seen and I was impressed. The movie follows the plot of Star Wars perfectly adding in jokes and and merchandsing references only the way Mel Brooks can."
5,Spaceballs-crazy fun!,"Spaceballs!! It's Star Wars gone mad! If you have seen this movie, you really don't need a review - you already know that it is just a bunch of crazy fun! If you have not seen this movie, prepare to laugh out loud! I ordered this for my 15 year old son after being unable to find it in any stores locally (it's an older one!) He is a big Star Wars fan & both he & his friend were laughing throughout the entire movie. I had forgotten how silly & fun this movie is, until we all sat down last week with a bowl of popcorn & watched it together - fun, fun, fun!The only ""warning"" I might add before purchasing or viewing this movie with younger children is the ""G"" rating. It really should be a ""PG-13"" as there are several instances of mature language (not overt) and one or two sexual references. Not as over the top as most movies nowadays, but you may want to preview the movie before sharing it with the youngsters."
3,2 generations of Stars Wars fans,"I saw this film and the original STAR WARS film in the theaters when they were first released. Mel Brooks became a favorite of mine. This was a family movie night selection. My boy loved it.SPACEBALLS has tons of sight gags and name-game jokes. There is also plenty of just-plain silliness that I would expect from Mel Brooks. Bill Pullman as the Han Solo parody and John Candy, complete with dog ears and tail, as his sidekick are fun together. Mel Brooks appears as Yogurt, the wise and colorful. Rick Moranis as a slightly shorter, but enormously helmeted version of Darth Vadar was my favorite.Although this film is not quite YOUNG FRANKENSTIEN or BLAZING SADDLES, it is a great way to spend an evening with the kids.I'm told they would have given it a 4-star rating."
5,ludicrous speed!,"This movie's hilarious, even if you don't get Star Wars. Mel Brooks spoofs everything from Star Trek to Star Wars (there's even a Wizard of Oz parody), and does a good job, sparing nothing. I liked the Instant Video scene (which makes me laugh no matter how many times I watch it), the scene where the ship goes into ""ludicrous speed"", the A--hole scene, and the scene where President Skroob reveals his luggage combination (12345). If you've seen Galazy Quest or any Star Wars or Star Trek flick, you will enjoy this."
1,.....,"It had been years since I'd seen the film and I didn't remember it being very good... but for 8 bucks I figured I'd give it another chance. Should have trusted my memory... Mel Brooks really bottomed out after he stopped working with Gene Wilder (and ditto for Wilder, but that's another story). The jokes are limp as a wet noodle, the comic timing is terrible. I did not laugh ONCE. That's a total of ZERO laughs for those of you keeping score at home. The commentary track is also painfully boring as Brooks continuously explains the obvious and pats himself on the back..."
1,Maybe I need to be Druish?,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever made. How Mel Brooks can make both Young Frankenstein (a true classic) and this dull, unfunny, horrible movie just boggles the mind. Baby Jane's daddy was wrong, apparently you can lose your talent.I made the mistake of suggesting to a friend that we see this movie when it was at the theater - and he still hasn't forgiven me. I haven't forgiven me."
3,Ah...try Monty Python,"I saw Spaceballs after my brother raved on about it, and people think it is the funniest movie they have ever seen. i don't think so. me, liking the star wars series, see this movie only as mediocre. if you want some good hilarious laughs, try monty python or ben stiller."
3,I SEE YOUR SHWARTZ IS AS BIG AS MINE,"Funny movie from Mel Brooks, totally hands down outragious and yet mediocre. Most of the gags just feel the need to spoof up Star Wars but i dont buy that. Brooks should have spoofed up Aliens (which he did for 2 seconds) or 2001 and maybe even the day the earth stood still. Oh hell, what can you do. Its a funny movie, I laughed quite a lot and theres un-expected excellent FX too. All hail yogurt, this is a funny movie, wish there really was a Spaceballs 2 :The Search For More Money."
4,"Ok, not his best","Ok its not mel brooks best films (Blazing Saddles , The Producers and Young Frankenstein) are far better, but I give 4 stars for a great film (entertaining, and better visual effects than the original star trek/wars) and for Bill Pullman wearing the indiana jones jacket !"
4,Another funny Brooks film.,"This time Brooks is spoofing Sci-fi films.Some of the jokes are really cheesy but all in all this is a good collection of jokes and sight gags.With the comic talents of stars such as Rick Moranis,John Candy,Joan Rivers and others.Some consider this film to be the start of Brooks downfall but I consider it as one of his best."
4,Hilarious -- this is the best Star Wars episode,"What a great parody on a lot of different movies. I enjoy watching it just to get a good laugh. It's simply hilarious, but it's not for those who take Star Wars religiously. They'll undoubtedly be offended at it. I'd cut out a couple of obscene scenes, but other than that, it's pretty clean and simply funny."
4,what a marvellous edition of this spoof classic,"Great spoof film and is one of Mel Brooks better films along with Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. This edition is loaded with great special features. The new documentaries are fun and informative, covering most aspects of the making of the movie from beginning till release. Most of the key players are involved which is great too. There are commentaries and other featurettes too. The transfer is excellent and they really show off the great effects which still stand up today. Pick this one up."
3,"Too Much, Over the Top!","""High Anxiety,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" and ""History of the World: Part I"" were classics. ""Spaceballs,"" though lathers the corn on too thick and it loses appeal. The good news is that the handsome star finds out he is a prince, gets the once-stuffy princess, and Planet Spaceball does not get Planet Druidia's air."
4,"""What's the matter, Colonel Sandurz? Chicken?""","SPACEBALLS was perhaps the last of Mel Brooks' really funny spoof movies. Following from the classic BLAZING SADDLES Western parody, SPACEBALLS takes in all and every science fiction movie, breaking every rule and recycling every cliche for maximum comic effect.No sci-fi movie is safe: STAR WARS is the biggest casualty, with plenty of laugh-out-loud references (Pizza the Hutt and Dark Helmet being just two of many). The plot loses it way to the insane jokes, much like many of Mel Brooks' movies, but that really doesn't matter. You'll be laughing too hard to notice.Obviously this isn't going to appeal to everyone just as science-fiction doesn't appeal to everyone. However, if you're prepared for a riotous, zany cast (Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet brings pathetic bad guys to a new level) armed with a funny script, then SPACEBALLS is for you."
5,Same as above,I bought it for a Christmas gift for one of my brothers that like movies that Mel Brooks stars in.
3,"Zany, Irreverent, and Mel Brooksy to a T","I really don't know how funny this would be to a person who hasn't seen Star Wars, Star Trek, Lawrence of Arabia, Planet of the Apes, and a few other films, but if you've seen them, you will be chuckling, chortling, and laughing loudly. The acting is bad... but it is SUPPOSED to be bad! The action sequences are stilted and artificial, but they are SUPPOSED to be! This is a spoof film, as in a ""good-humored hoax, or a light, amusing satire.""Galaxy Quest, Mars Attacks, and Coneheads are real stories on top of the gentle satire. Spaceballs is... Spaceballs. Hoax and satire are not hidden here!PG-13 for language. May the Schwartz be with you!"
4,A Great Satire!,Enjoyed every minute of it! Felt it should be PG13 for mild cursing and strong sexual inuendos.
3,ha*breath*hahaha,"hey people! get this vid! it may not be the most original theme (pretty much like star wars), but it definately is worth seeing. some of the jokes are a little lame, but you have to just go with the flow it's fun. that's it! this movie is fun."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"That is weird when you remember something as being funny, but when you see it again, it really isn't. I watched this with my kids, eek! We have enjoyed other spoof movies, Airplane, Scary Movie..., and this one was the worst I think we have seen. Plus, now it looks so dated. I am disappointed that this is the best they could come up with for Star Wars spoof. Doesn't make me want to watch more of Mel Brooks, maybe I'll let the kids give Monty Python a try.I almost bought this out of nostalgia, glad I rented first."
1,Where is my DVD,"I still have not received this product :( First it was said to be here by the 3rd, then the 4th, and I still havent gotten it. Uusally everything comes to me so early."
3,Entertaining,"Not as funny as I remembered but still cute. John Candy's character ""Barf"" (Chewy) and Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet are probably enough reason to watch this movie. The rest of the cast does what the script asks for but little less. Interestingly enough the main characters Lone Star and Prince Vespa are the ones that are weakest. Not all the gags succeed but I still find this very easy to watch. Even if you are not a Star War fan you can enjoy it."
2,"""Spaceballs"" sufferes from writters block!","Some jokes are funny, but too few to save this over long, dull spoof of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy and beyond. The script is hurting more than it needed to because anyone can poke fun at ""Star Wars""! This tried just a little too hard to impress the large audience of the ""Star Wars"" films. Some jokes had effect, but most were oldies, not goodies."
2,I found this to be a dud,"I only got one laugh out of this whole thing: when they were fast-forwarding the VHS tape. The rest of it was well-meant, but I can't understand why this is a ""cult classic.""Legally, though, I couldn't stop wondering why, if the guys from FAMILY GUY were able to do a send-up of the same movie but using all the actual characters, storyline, and Lucas material, why couldn't Brooks? It would have been so much funnier. As it was, John Candy playing a half-human / half-dog probably looked a lot funnier on the page than it wound up being on the screen. Did the law change or something? Why was Brooks prevented a direct attack but Seth McFarlane allowed one?"
4,Classic Mel Brooks movie,This movie falls in line with most of the other Mel Brooks movies. It is a spoof on the star wars series but is humorous all the way through.
3,"Rick Moranis, Comic Genius","This very, very comedic movie is mostly trying to make spoofs of other classics. Everyone on the ""good"" side was a horrible actor. Their horrible acting job, suprisingly didn't make the movie funny at all. The only thing that makes this movie well worth your time is the subtle (and not-so subtle) wisecracks (some against other movies). 90% of the good jokes come from the bad guys, Skoob and Helmet.Corny ending, bad acting... who cares? You will CRACK UP!!!!"
5,Funniest Movie Ever,"This movie is the best ever. Its hilarious and just when you think theey cant make fun of Star wars anymore, they do. Even if your a big Star Wars fan you'll still think its the funniest, best movie ever."
4,"As good as Young Frankenstein, but different.","This is probably the most hilariously joke-filled Mel Brooks film, contrasting with his more complete films such as Young Frankenstien, which uses more funny ideas and concepts rather than one liners and visual jokes. Young Frankenstein managaes to be more high-brow and includes an actual plot, whereas this one is joke after joke. For a good trilogy, purchase Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Then go buy Blazing Saddles and History of the World if you enjoyed those three. Don't by Dracula, Dead and Loving it, and if you've done so, burn it."
4,You Can't go wrong with Mel Brooks Movies,"""When is then?"" ""Now."" ""When are we?"" ""Now."" ""When will now be then?"" ""Soon."" This movie is the king of comedy. You don't have to love Star Wars to love this film. Then, of course, all Mel Brooks films are always hilarious. So sit down and watch Dark Helmet, Pizza the Hut, Lone Star, and Barf as they travel hilariously through space."
3,"Good Mel Brooks humor, but a little too silly for me.","You definitely have to be in the right frame of mind when you watch this one. At times it is hilarious, but at others it is just a little too silly for me. If you enjoy the Mel Brooks style of humor though, you will not be disappointed. It's also kind of cool seeing an actor like Bill Pullman (of Independence Day fame) in one of his earlier roles. As for family viewing, younger kids may not get the jokes which spoof even earlier movies such as Saturday Night fever. And although this movie is rated PG13, the characters cuss just a little too much for it to be appropriate for younger viewers."
3,Good for 1987...,"But not so much for 2013, unless you are 17 or younger. If you remember this movie fondly as a kid from the 80's leave the memory alone and go read a book :)"
5,great movie,"I could watch this movie over and over, my kind of humor. Very funny, clean and all around a fun time."
5,A true american classic!,"A must see movie. It is a riot. I my opinion one of Mel Brooks top two movies, number one being Young Frankenstein. Its one of those movies you can watch again and again."
4,great satire from the late eighties,"Mel Brooks definitely lives up to expectations with Spaceballs. This parody of the Star Wars movies will deliver laughs whether you are a sci fi fan or not. The cast of characters (including Bill Pullman, John Candy, and Rick Moranis...and of course Mel Brooks) closely parallels the familiar cast of Star Wars, but Rick Moranis takes the cake as Dark Helmet, the Darth Vader-like figure. (""And now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb."")Personally, I found this movie amusing at 10, and now at 22 I still think it's wonderful. Most of the other reviews give you an idea of what the movie contains, so I won't get into a long explanation, but I have to recommend this one pretty highly as a great comedy."
4,May the SCHWARTZ be with you!,"""Not . . . again"" gasps poor John Hurd (Alien) as (another!) alien baby bursts from his poor chest at the table at an intergalactic diner. But, this movie ain't Alien. The baby beastie immediately breaks into a song-and-dance number that should be familiar to all of you who know your Looney Tunes 'toons.Mel Brooks, you have done it again. from hilarious character names (Dark Helmet, Pizza The Hut), to affectionate and dead-on spoofs of Star Wars and other space adventures, as well as our movie tie-in culture, you have once more hit the nail on the head.Thank you.Oh, acting? Cast, you say? No problems there. They all get it.And I would recommend you getting this.Enjoy."
4,Funny Wars,This is a great take off on the Star Wars Trilogy with some classic comic lines. Who can beat Mel Brooks! This is a good one to add to your Star Wars collection.
5,gotta Have me some spaceballs,my autistic loved the movie on tv. so i thought i would buy one. the movie came brand new. very fast shipping. honest seller. thank u. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++++++++++++==
5,Come On....................................................... PSP!,"This is an incredible CE 2-DISC Set I've been waiting for 8 years. Now that it exists, I'm still waiting to be able to pull it out of my back pocket; put it in a tiny plasma screen while i'm in the senior lounge with my friends. I mean can you imagine it? It's absolutely breathtaking where technology is going these days."
4,"classic spoof, stupid robot","I used to talk about this with my friends back in middle school, and now today in college I still enjoy it. If you like Mel brooks then you'll enjoy this movie. If you have yet to experience brooks then go out and rent his movies, they're hilarious. I would've given this movie 5 stars except that I despise the robot that is voiced by Joan rivers, it killed the movie. I know it was supposed to make fun of C-3P0 but it was stupid and I hate it. Outside of Dot Matrix, the movie is hilarious"
5,Great comedy,"From ""Barf, give me a reading"" to ""I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate,"" this movie is hilarious. Every line has a purpose, and you have got to watch and love this movie."
5,"THIS FILM IS: ""HOT, TOO HOT!!""","""YOU HAVE THE RING, AND I SEE YOUR SCHWARZ IS AS BIG AS MINE!"" OKAY, SPACEBALLS HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR CLASSIC COMEDY, EXCEPT MAYBE GIANTS (FEZZIK YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) MEL BROOOKS CAN DO NO WRONG, AND RICK MORANIS MERELY REINFORCES HIS COMIC GENIUS WITH HIS MANIC DEPICTION OF DARK HELMET, DON'T WORRY SIR I DIDN'T SEE YOU PLAYING WITH YOUR DOLLS AGAIN. WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS FILM IS ANYTHING BUT VILLAGE! BIG NICK & LIL' RIZ"
5,Ridiculously funny film,"This is a great movie, just as I remembered it from when I was younger. I did notice though that movie is rated PG but has every curse word that should have netted it an R rating. Not a complaint at all, but anyone wanting to avoid their children from hearing those words should a) Grow up and b) Avoid. Otherwise, may the schwartz be you!"
5,Comedy Classic,"Many view this movie as a step down from many of Mel's classics, but in my opinion, this remains one of the best comedies of all time. Spoofing the widely popular Star Wars trilogy, Spaceballs is hilarious. Mel himself, John Candy, the sound guy from the Police Academy movies, among others are all great. It is pure comedy. Cheesy at times, yes, but most comedies are. This is slapstick in it's purest form.Extras are a little lacking on this DVD, but you can't beat the price. I have heard reports of a possible Special Edition, but no word on a date yet."
5,Must Have,"Look, if you're a Mel Brooks fan, this is a must have. It's hilarious, and good for a fun family movie."
4,another great one from Brooks!,"Yeah, it ain't no Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, but it's still a lot of fun and it makes fun of Star Wars! What could be better?"
4,"Take that, Star Wars!","This is one heck of a sci-fi spoof of Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, and Planet of the Apes. It got me laughing so hard that I literally almost had a heart attack. Mel Brooks, John Candy, and the rest of the cast do well here. The jokes are spot-on and there is no feeling of being drowsy when watching this. Thank you, Mr. Brooks!A-"
3,Slightly dirty satire in space,"Why ""satire""? During the course of the movie there are several references made to the marketing of the movie as a movie, much to the confusion of the characters in it. The film borrows largely from the Star Wars series but also Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, The Princess Bride, and a few lesser known sci fi and fantasy movies and television shows. A lot the humor is crude and rude in nature. Not one of Mel Brooks best movies but it can be a funny and mindless relaxation period unless you are easily offended by ""bathroom"" and sexual humor or you take your sci fi very seriously."
1,BEWARE!!,"This movie contains ALOT of profanity, every word imaginable. It should be rated R, so parents beware!"
1,Oh my eyes...,"They were heavy as I tried to sit through this short (but endless-seeming) movie. As one of the few critics to diss this, I will keep it brief. Several of my friends-not just one-recommended I see this, so they brought it to our group get-together. In a word, the film was cheesy. I know it's a parody and I've seen some great parodies, but couldn't the quality have been better? Not only the film quality was aggravating, but the characters. The princess, Yogurt, and Pizza the Hut were probably the hardest to sit there and watch. Long before the credits rolled, I was out in that chair. I'm still confused as to all the positive hype about this film."
1,keep your balls...please!,Space-Balls? Are you freaking kidding me? I want part of my life back after wasting it on this turd. It's not funny in the least. Definitely one of the all-time worst movies ever. Believe it !!... Pass!!
1,So unfunny it's scary,"I saw this when it came out in theaters and I wasn't the only person not laughing. How Mel Brooks is able or was ever able to get any films financed is beyond me. Who thought it would be a good idea to release a Star Wars spoof in the mid-late 80's when no one cared about Star Wars anymore. It only goes to show how comedically out of touch Mel Brooks is, when he thinks that Star Wars is still the cutting edge of pop culture 10 years after the movie left theaters. Loaded with unfunny line after unfunny line. This is the kind of stuff your grandpa would tell you and think it's funny. Well, I guess it makes sense seeing as how old and crusty Mel Brooks is. All these jewish references in the movie don't do anything for me. It looks like Mel Brooks has confused a Sci-fi spoof with Yiddish theater. I guess you have to be jewish to find this guys ""humor"" funny. If 2nd grade level fart and booger jokes really crack you up then you'll love this movie."
1,THE STUPIDEST MOVIE EVER MADE,I cant even rate this movie its so horrible. The worst spoof in history. I watched this movie at my friends house cause this other kid brought it over. I was about to hurl halfway through because it was so pathetic. NOTHING IN THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS FUNNY. We made fun of the kid that brought it over and told him he was gay. NEVER EVER SEE THIS MOVIE.
3,slapstick comedy,"I first saw this film when I was 12, and I remember how much I laughed when I saw it.This is a spoof of all things science fiction, it has references to Star Trek, and all of the charcters are based on thos in Star Wars.The story is that a group of charcters known as the Spaceballs, led by the evil Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and Colnel Sanders ( can you believe it?) plan to steal the air from planet Druidia for their own planet. But first, they need something to bargain with. And so, they plot to kidnap Princess Vespa, the daughter of King Roland of Druidia. She has just jilted her fiance at the altar in search of adventure.Enter Lone Star and his sidekick Barf ('Barf, Puke. Whatever!), who are hired by the King to rescue her before she is taken captive by the Spaceballs.The sort of film one would watch at home on a rainy day."
5,Spaceballs,"This is a very funny movie. It is a knockoff of the Star Wars movies. Has some foul language, may not be good for young children. All the adults in this household loves the humor in this movie."
4,Very funny,"I'm not familiar with mr. Brooks' other movies, but I've watched Spaceballs since I was a child and it never fails to bring me down laughing.From the incredible Dark Helmet, to 'combing' the desert, it's a grand parade of laughs.If you haven't seen this, I recommend you do.On the technical side, the video quality is very good, although the full-frame version is a bit worse than the widescreen, although that's understandable.There're some extras on the dvd, but frankly their video quality is appalling (something like VHS) and doesn't hold a candle to the feature film. But then again, I didn't buy this dvd for the extras.I missed English subtitles, because I'm not a native English speaker, but the audio quality was good and clear, even though it sometimes overwhelmed my poor hifi-set's speakers. I had little trouble keeping the music/soundeffects and speech separated.May the schwartz be with ya!"
3,"Beautiful Trike, but heavy","The Morgan Pink Pegasus Trike is beautiful, but very heavy for my 4 year old girl when she tries to climb small slopes at the park. Kids with lighter trikes pass her by all the time and I can see frustration on her face. Overall is a good looking trike, but I would purchase a lighter one. Kids love the speed, not the beauty."
3,Nice looking but missing a lot of functions,"I originally bought this chair because of the way it looked. I always get compliments on it in my kitchen because it looks 'nice', especially with the wood. The advantages are: It looks nice, it has a removeable cloth cover that is machine washable, the tray comes off and is dishwaster safe. However, I would not buy it again. The disadvantages are: The seat is not adjustable (only the tray moves forward & backward). I needed an adjustable seat because my baby was small & I had to stuff towels around him for 2 months to sit in it. Also, there are no wheels on it so it's not very moveable (it's also heavy). It also does not fold up like other brands. If you are going to get it, make sure you have a big kitchen with room to set it out and leave it out. Hope this helps."
1,Big and Awkward,"This high chair is very difficult to to get baby in and out of and the safety strap is useless and hard to figure out.This is a large chair and takes up quite a bit of space. I gave mine away after two weeks of aggravation!If you are looking for a wooden chair consider getting one you can use without the tray so when your child gets bigger you can just pull it up to the table with out the tray...like a youth seat. I have three children and have been through quite a few high chairs and this was the worse!I wish I had bought a Stokke Kinder-Zeat. I am buying those for my sister who has twins. If I had bought those I would still be using them for my three children age 2, 5 and 7."
1,Nice looking but very hard to clean....,"I bought this chair because it matched my kitchen and since we knew it would be sitting out all the time that was important to me. When my daughter was first using the chair it was great because it is very sturdy and the belly/leg straps held her inside. However, she is now 10 months old and feeding herself. The chair has become very hard to keep clean. Along the sides of the chair (beside your child's legs) are what look like wooden rails. Food gets stuck between the rails and underneath the back padding. I either have to suck the food out with the vaccuum cleaner or push it through the rails with a butter knife in order to get all of the pieces and parts out. The chair would be much better without these rails or if the entire white plastic piece was removable. My suggestion would be to look for another sturdy chair that is easier to keep clean."
2,"Slooow, with recording dynamic problems","I bought this in the two cd incarnation: Requiem, Pelleas et Melisande, Dolly, Melodies, Pavane. So the mastering may not be the same but the cd does not indicate any remastering.It's tedious. Giulini takes things very slow. The recorded dynamics are not good and I found myself running to my receiver turning it up and down -annoying. Yes, Battle has a pretty voice but it also has a hardness to it that I don't like. I prefer Lorraine Hunt (Lieberson) in Pelleas.If you want the quiet one, more in line with what Faure wrote try Cambridge Singer's on Collegium. For the suped-up mass orchestra version, I've enjoyed Wilcock's/Leger on EMI, Cluyten's on EMI, and Amsernt on London/Decca."
4,Good product,"This is as good as fresh ginger, but..for a $3.99 jar they charged me $8.99 shipping and handling. I will not order this again from this merchant again!"
3,Garth Brooks Rox at his Age,Hi I am 14/f from Texas and I go to every fair and listen to Garth every year when I can be there. He is awesome. If ya'll did not know that he is only 36 years old and he know how to get Texas rockin into his boots. And singing along. He has evrybody to help him and make him stay with his band. Instead of playing Baseball. For the San Diego Padres. The only way he stayed with his band is because everybody loves him. And he knows if he leaves then everybody will be very upset and not really listen to any C&W music anymore. But that is why I had chose Garth Brooks for top # 3 artist.
3,Garth is so much better than this,I am 20 years old and a Garth fan .But this video just isn't his best I remember before the show he was going on all the shows promoting his Central Park appearance and he was saying that he was nervous about it and that he had had a dream about it and that nobody showed up. But I was surprised at how his voice was kind of shaky and not as good as it usually is. I guess he really was nervous.
1,What a disappointment!,"This is a very sad excuse for a train. The engine could not pull the cars. The flimsy, plastic connectors may have been part of the problem. To make matters worse, the vendor would not agree to take the product back because, in his estimation, it had been ""used"". Evidently, the customer is supposed to be able to determine whether or not this product is defective simply by looking at the unopened package. Needless to say, this was a very unsatisfactory purchase both in terms of the product and the vendor. However, Amazon was more than cooperative and helpful, and I did receive a full refund. Over the years, this has been my one and only frustrating transaction with Amazon. I will avoid any purchases from this vendor and this manufacturer and will continue to shop with Amazon."
5,MIL ESTRELLAS.,"En la Séptima Sinfonía de Gustav Mahler, las unicas versiones que a mi gusto tienen un lectura completamente satisfactoria son: Esta motivo del comentario, la de LB en Sony y la de Solti CHSO. De ahí para adelante todas las demás me dejan insatisfecho.Bernstein realmente comprende y siente la música de Mahler. El manejo rítmico y la profundidad de ésta obra, encuentran su plena realización en manos del Maestro Bernstein. Note el oyente que en el Rondó final Bernstein hace sonar a la New York Philharmonic en su forma más INCANDESCENTE!Nadie que ame a Mahler debe dejar de comprar éste fabuloso CD."
2,Solo Diving Disappointment,I purchased this book expecting a book on solo diving techniques and gear requirements. The author seems more interested in making a case for solo diving than teaching solo diving methods. I got more out of the testimonials in the rear of the book than from the author. Very disappointing reading
3,"Overall, a good book on solo Diving","I enjoyed the many testimonials by experienced divers as well as the author's advice on training and equipment required. I was a bit put off by the author's oft-repeated opinion that solo diving is only for the handful of uuber-fit physical specimens such as himself. He likely did not intend for it to read that way, but that was the impression that I took away. I have been diving for 15 years and am about 100 lbs. overweight. I dive within my limitations and have redundant gear for safety. I have never had an issue or felt in harm's way."
3,Solo diving,"If you are a tech diver, then you probably dive alone most of the time. If you have been through a tech diving class, then you have the skills to dive solo. This book is about the reasons that you can be a solo diver. If you expect an instruction book, then you aren't ready for solo diving, attitude or equipment wise."
1,"Why you might want to solo dive, NOT how to solo dive",Little more than an editorial on why to solo diveVery useful information on how.
3,Insight,"""Solo Diving"" provides insight and some good advice from the author and a number of experienced solo divers. This is not a certification type book. It definitely has great points on the flaws of buddy diving. It also lays out differences, pros, and cons of redundant air systems and gives a few guidelines to adopt for safe solo diving. Pick it up to read on your next planned deco dive."
1,It ain't what your hoping for !!!,"The book is more of an opinion editorial on the subject of solo diving rather than a technical description of how to solo dive, which is what I thought it would be (judging the book by its' cover).""Deep Descent"" offers more technical advice than this book."
4,A decent collection of APB's earlier works,"Apoptygma Berzerk's music is a mix of quality fast-paced EBM/industrial, and white noise experimental technoid stuff that doesn't satisfy me at all. The Apocalyptic Manifesto is basically a compilation album including some of APB's best songs, remixes, and a few previously unreleased tracks as well. There are some great tracks on here, including Deep Red (one of my favorite songs of all time), Burning Heretic, Electronic Warfare, and a couple others. There's also a few nonsense tracks on here that are kind of crappy, but the good ones overshadow them. It may take some time to grow on you if you haven't been listening to APB since the beginning, but overall The Apocalyptic Manifesto is a solid buy."
3,Apop's darkest hour.,"Stephan Groth, from Norway, sings in english. A bit of a sci-fi nut, this is by far the most ""industrial"" effort by this one man band. Since the release of this album, Apop when on to a much more futuristic synthpop format....in fact....some say that Apop was the first band to be noted as ""futurepop"". I'm not shure if VnV Nation or Apop officially started the futurepop...but for those unaware...this album certainly isn't futurepop. This is much closer to electro-industrial. I love the song ""stitch"". Dark stuff here. Not my favorite Apop album, but certainly worthy of being called decent."
3,Author told an one-sided story,"The author did a good job describing the interactions actions between modern China and Dalai Lamma. I, however, found his coverage using mostly tibetan materials wanting. His treatment of the hundreds of years of Tibetan history during the Ming dynasty with one sentence ""By conferring titles on Tibetans already in power, the Ming emperors merely recognized political reality."" and citing a certain E. Sperling also raise the question whether the book represents a genuine historical study. Furthermore, his treated the different dynasties as different countries also entails an racist point of view which was stated more explicitly by the Amazon.com reviewer: ""Does he mean the Mongols when they controlled the territory we call China and the Manchus when they did? Were these legitimate Chinese governments?"" A similar question of ""Are America with black/native American/and Hispanic president and congress legitimate American governments?"" would be unthinkable."
1,Visa approved.,"After having written this book on Tibet's history, Goldstein is still able to easily get visas to conduct research inside Tibet by the Chinese authorities. This tells you how his books and research conclusions are viewed by the CCP."
4,interesting reading for anyone interested in Tibet,"I found this book highly interesting to read, it does not contain any of the dewey-eyed nostalgia of many books on Tibet. Instead the author takes a neutral and realistic stand on past and present day relations with China. As a supporter of full independence for Tibet, I did not find the book offensive to that viewpoint. Good reading ,give it a try!"
4,a very useful yet too rarely seen factbook,"This is a must for everyone who has interest in the Tibet issue and wants to talk about it. One who hasn't read it should just shut up his/her mouth, go to get this book, read it, and compare the HISTORICAL FACTS in this book to the stereotyped prejudice one has learnt from propaganda, hollywood blockbuster movies, or whatever."
3,Does the job,"This watch was a gift for my Mother. The function of this watch is very complicated in setting it up and very easy to get it off the time if you push the wrong button, and sometime the elderly will do that with out even knowing.Other than that it works fine. If I buy Mother another one I will get one a little easier to set up took me and my husband a while even with instruction to set it up.."
4,It Talks To Me,"My mother has sensitive skin and this watch is great. She loves that it has big numbers and it talks. She is still learning how to work it. it went off in a meeting and she thought she was hearing things. She needs to read the instructions because it keeps saying the wrong time. When she learns how to work it she said it will be great to know the time at work every hour. ""Everyone always like to here the time for lunch and time to get off."" LOL She do not like to read instuction. She is the type of person that want it to work right out the box that is why we rate it only a 4."
4,Has worked great for two years,"Have used this bag for two years now with no problems. I does look as though the clamp could be better designed, but it does its job and has seen a few saddle changes. The bag itself is good and spacious and I like the retainer for my rear light. Overall, I am sure there are things that could be better, but it has done what I need it to do."
2,Disappointing,"Clamp for mounting to seat rails does not fit standard bicycle seat rails. If you want to mount this to a bicycle, make sure the bicycle is made in China, too. Poor fit of clamp to seat rails will eventually cause clamp to break or fall off of bike. Also, bag fits too close to seat, allowing the bag to rub irritatingly on legs during pedaling. America demands low prices, but I demand durable things that work properly. This does not work properly, so I will never learn if it is durable."
2,Haviland China: The Age of Elegance (Schiffer Book for Collectors),"While the written information contained within is remarkable in its' breadth and detail, and the publication certainly has a good ""hand"" on the current market, the publication fails sadly in its' photographic quality.Certain patterns colours are corrupted in the printing process. A notable example of this is on page 181, Figure 390 ""Dinner Plate Chambord Pattern"". This plate in fact has a soft green tinge to the entire plate and the edge is a teal / blue. It is not a red pinkish colour, which is how it is represented.This is a significant misrepresentation of the appearance of the article and there are a series of errors in the publication of a similar calibre, and it reflects badly on what is fundamentally a good publication."
3,Classical Music,I was looking for a more complete compilation of famous archestral arias. This one has too many short short excerpts.
1,Waste of my time.,"If you are looking for a book that covers poorly drawn conclusions and pitiful insite into the actual technology of DSL, then this is your book. I only hope my kids aren't forced to read this type of stereo instruction manual to better themselves in the world. The author has no technical knowledge of the subject matter at hand and I got the distinct impression that there was a technologist next to him spoon feeding him buzz words."
4,"Almost best performance of 2nd concerto, but the 1st one ...","Yes,Zimerman's performance is glorious in 2nd concerto.I could only compared it with Ashkenazy's (with David Zinman/London Symphony Orch.)performance. Zimerman is really better than Ashkenazy. But in 1st concerto; Maurizio Pollini's (with Paul Kletzki/Philharmonia Orch.)performance is quite better than Zimerman's. In general very stylish performance of Zimerman."
3,Not the best reference book I've seen,but its most interesting feature is that it covers the psychology of blocking and techniques for unblocking comprehensively.I'm just not crazy about the organization of the content.
5,Just what you are looking for,This is an excellent durable replica of Anakin's starfighter.My 5 year old plays with it constantly and loves it.Would recommend highly for any child who love Star Wars.
4,"cool,fun,cool","when i saw this toy i i started jumping. i wanted this toy so badly. and when i finnnaly got i ripped it open! i loaded in the missiles and put on the stickers and did the finishing touches. and when ilooked at it sonething was wrong! the cockpit looked waaaay to big! it looked goofy to me. but it is way fun! if you dont care about the cockpit, this is a must buuuuuyyyyy!!!!!!!! (except when you put on the decals, there will be extras, so yoll have to put them where you want)"
2,if you can get it for a penny...,"go for it; because it's only worth the shipping charge. ""Grave""---the sound happens a full second before the video. 'House'---the screen is too dark to see much, and it's very boring. 'Guru'---looks like a play put on by your neighbors: like the actors were told, ""don't do anything except read your lines."""
5,Lil' Kinz Cow,"I recieved this from my friend for my birthday. I actually forgot I even had it until tonight when I looked through my bin of Webkinz, 36 to be exact. Anyway after it had been sitting around for a year and a half, it looks like I bought it today. Despite it's spiked up hair, it is VERY soft. Anyway I have no idea what I should name it. I have a fun prank though, I might name it Mr. Moo, dress it up in blue and stand by the Ice-Cream Cart in the Kinzville Park. Here's another prank I might do, name it Ms. Cowaline, dress it up as her and go around the Clubhouse. Anyway I think you should buy this. A great addition to any boy or girl's collection."
2,This book was OK a little bit.,"This book had a nice conlfict,but it need to be improved. It need to have more action. It was nice for someone in a lower grade than me (6)."
1,A Horrible Book To Me(Girls may like it),This is a great fairytale for girls.It is by Natalie Babbit.It is about a girl named Winnie that wants to run away. She runs away into a wood she owns. She sees a boy that is drinking from a spring. The boy and his parents kidnap her. She learns that the water she wanted to drink makes people live forever. I didn't like this book.alec4th grade
2,this book smells,"this book was too short and the events take too long. there realy isn't a climax and the author could have tried harder but she completly fell of the edge, took a wrong turn."
2,"Could have been better, still okay","I had to read this book for an assingment in sixth grade. Alot of people who had read it told me it was bad and boring. I thought to myself (never believing what people tell me, even to this day)'oh, well it can't really be THAT bad right?'. So, I started reading it with no worries. Soon later, I thought back into my thick skull and knew that this book was not going to be on my ""Favorite Book List"". Yes, sure, this book wasnt really that bad, I actually thought it was okay, but I didnt like the ending. To be honest with you, I thought it was pointless and stupid. But if you are still looking for an okay-kind-of-dissapointing-but-still-okay-and-worthwhile-to-read-on-rainy-days-book, then check out Tuck Everlasting. And dont forget to post you results on Amazon.com!"
3,... by Jonathan Daniels,I thought it was a good book and that but sometimes it was to fake and not enough raeliseme. It had to much detail when it was descriding a charactor. And they did not tell what the man in the yellow suit's name or where he came from. I thought that the end of the book was the best because it was very good in action. Like when Mae Tuck hit the man in the yellow suit over the head. Also Jessie came back after 2 years and found Winnie dead. When Jessie found the toad in the middle of the road he said it could get killed and that it will not live forever like the them.
2,Tuck Everlasting,I like the book because it was a little fun because if you think livintg for ever it is realy fun. I didn't like the book because it is confusing and pridictable.
4,Tuck Everlasting,I happen to think that Tuck Everlasting is a very well-written piece of literature. It deals with an issue that everyone thinks about at one point in their life and changes their view on it. It is a great mixture of adventure and mystery that will keep you from putting it down. My favorite part of the book is the suspense and the ability it has to keep you guessing. I recommend this book to everyone!
2,A Bad Book - by Eric,I recommend this book to someone who likes boring books! I could not wait until the book was over with. It was boring because it talked about living forever and it is impossible to live forever. The only good thing about the book was that Winnie had a lot of courage to help her friends and I think that is good.
3,The Tuck's Story Review,"This is not considered a great book in my opinion. It would be better if there was more action and not just description. I didn't like this book very much the first time I read it, but it is easier to understand as you get older. Would YOU want to live forever?"
3,A Book to Make You Think,"Tuck Everlasting is fantasy story written by Natalie Babbit. The subject matter of this book is living forever.Main characters are Tucks family ( Angus, Mae, Miles, Jesse), Winnie and the stranger. And the toad`s exist is important.In this story Winnie saw Jesse to drink the water of the spring and she knew about the secret. She had to decide whether to drink or not. I thought it is a heavy problem for her, because she is still young.This fantacy story needs an imagination. It is difficult for me to imagin. Would you try to read this book by using your imagination?"
4,Would be perfect if not for the somewhat weak ending...,"What a great buildup this novel has. It's based on an outstanding premise and puts the main character in a very difficult situation. But just as this situation is being built up more and more, it suddenly levels off, the main character is off the hook, and we're left looking at a frog. All I could think was, ""That's it?""Here is the rare instance where I suggest the reverse-abridgement of a book, because Tuck Everlasting should have more room to explore the issue of eternity more thoroughly."
4,Tuck Everlasting,Tuck Everlasting is written by Natalie Babbit. The first chapter is boring but I'm glad I finished the book. The last sentece is the best part of the book. I enjoy how a toad tagged along in the book. Some of the things I don't like about the book are that Natalie Babbit didn't describe the main characters enough. I also didn't like that natalie Babbit didn't tell the man in the yellow suit's name because he didn't have an identity. On a scale on 1 to 10 10 being the best I would rate the book 7.
2,A simple story with a simple message,"The characters were amusing enough, but I thought it unrealistic that while the young boys were actually over a 100 yrs old, they still acted the age they appeared.Surely they would have matured during there life mentally, even though they stayed the same physically.The message about the life cycle is supposed to make you appreciate every age, obviuously that is something everybody must come to understand, because in reality, eternal life isn't an option."
4,Tuck Everlasting Book Review by Jamie Durand,"The book Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt fantastic book. Tuck Everlasting is about a family of four that drank magic water and lives forever. This story is with a girl named Winnie who finds out the Tuck's secret about life everlasting. The genre of the book is fantasy and adventure. The theme is about the circle of life and how dying is apart of life and the Tuck's are ""like rocks on the side of the road"" and no longer a part of the circle of life. The quote I like best is,""Don't be afraid of death but the unlived life."" I like this book because it makes me think a little more of life and death. The thing I don't like about the book is how over protective Winnie's family is with her.Natalie Babbitt was born in Ohio and lives in Rhode Island, her and her husband have three grown children."
3,A Book to Make You Think,"Tuck Everlasting is a fantasy fiction novel. The author, Natalie Babbitt wrote about living forever in this novel. We can consider whether living forever is good or not through the characters. Main characters are Winnie and Tuck family, Angus, Mae, Miles and Jesse. When Winnie knows Tuck family, she also knows their secrets. Through their relations, Winnie has grown up on mental side and she has appreciated about love. Tuck Everlasting is interesting book worth reading for children. The reader will think, ""Is it good living forever?"" It is difficult question, even if you are an adult. I think Winnie was too young to judge what she should do. I want to ask to all of reader, ""If you were Winnie, did you do that to the toad?"""
4,Its a Nice Book,"First time I heard of Tuck Everlasting I thought the name sounded cool and interesting, so I figured why not try it. Honestly I didn't get it and put the book down, not getting to through the first 5 pages. Having read it recently though(the whole thing), I really liked it. Winnie reminded me of myself in how she stayed faithful to the Tuckers. It was very bittersweet. I only wished it would of went more in depth and there would of been more."
5,Exactly what I wanted,The product was exactly what I wanted. I will be using it in my reading class as the students follow along in the book. The cover did read $14.99 and that is not what I paid for it. I think the price you pay and the sticker price on the cover should match.
4,tuck everlasting,"I read the book and then saw the movie. Which one did i like the best? i liked the book better because it seemed more real, and it was a more compleate story than the movie.The book is a little bit more detailed than the movie. i would suggest reading the book before you watch the movie. The movie is still a good movie just not as good as the book."
3,the book was so so,I found the book quite boring at the beginning but than it progresivly grew better and better as more action spilled in. I never felt any real emotion like some people did when they read the book. I found the book actually funny because of.........well it was just funny for me. I don't no if it was my friends making me laugh of not. I prefer suspense books. Over all I found the book ok.
3,good childrens book,I think Tuck Everlasting is a pretty good book for children to read but for teen-agers and grown-ups it can be a pretty boring book. I thought that the whole idea of having a spring that makes you immortal was a pretty cheesy. But as I said before it is a pretty good book for children.
2,Strange book. Not something I would strongly suggest,"This was a very strange and confusing book. It seemed too easy for my reading level. This book was about a family called the Tucks who discover a special water that makes them immortal. They also ""kidnapped"" a girl named Winnie who came to like them. This idea seemed too far out and didn't make sense. I, personally am more interested in mystery books. This book seemed a bit too short to describe things in detail and make an interesting story. This might be a good book for someone younger or someone who enjoys fantasy.Otherwise, Iwouldn't suggest reading this book."
2,Just Bad,"I thought that the book Tuck Everlasting Was boring and a disgrace.It was to unreal. The characters were not dispayed well at all.The characters did not have Good parts.For one there is a little girl who is shy ,rich,and way to over protected.She then helps a man break out of jail.Just plain wrong.The book also ended to soon.Natalie Babbit builds up suspense and then ends the book.What ever you do do not get this book."
5,kirkbride kids #4,"We really liked the book Tuck Everlasting. It was really sad when Winnie died because many people loved her and they were very upset when she died. She was very special to them. She was very kind, respectful ,loving by her whole family."
3,kirkbride kids #7,We gave it three stars out of five because it didn't intrest us much and that it wasn't very exiting.Most of us didn't think it was good to drink the water because you would havea sad life.
4,kirkbiride kids #8,this book was good for for all ages.this book is really good because there is alot of romance.If I could I will give this book 20 stars.
3,my opinion important to me only,i think it was a good book until the end I think she should have started looking for Jesse at 16 and bring a bottle of the special water so that when she found him she could drink it.
4,Tuck Everlasting,"I think the ppl that didn't lyk the book have their own reasons. They can be good reasons too, because i both lyked the book, yet i didn't lyk sum parts. I lyked the book MORE then I dislyked it!I have my reasons! But I think if u haven't read the book u shuld. I don't think it was a waste of tym...nd those of u who did think it was a waste of tym, i think it was jus a waste of tym for u 2 tell us, because not evry1 thinks that.Peaches 'n' Cream"
3,Forever Changing,"Tuck Everlasting was a story about a family that had a strange thing happen to them. Without asking for it, they were able to live forever by just stopping to take a drink of water from the spring in the wood. Winnie found out their secret, and so did the man in the yellow suit. The Tucks could only stay in one place a short time and then had to leave. They had no real friends or purpose in life. They wanted to be normal again. Years later Winnie had lived her life and died, and the Tucks were still wandering without any purpose.I enjoyed Tuck Everlasting. I liked the colorful descriptions the author used. I liked the way the author wanted to make you keep reading the book. I thought this was a good book."

She is a curious little girl and she found a place in her woods that she has never been to before. People live in that place, she finds out about the water and how something magical happens when you drink from it.That sounds good to me you never change your age if you drink from it, I would want to stay 11 for all my life. Then there is a man in the yellow suit who finds out the water and then kidnaps Winnie and it is so interesting you will love love this book beause I am very picky about my book choices and if I loved it you will to. It is so fun to read with a group of friends."
3,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting ReviewBy: Kevin EckerTuck Everlasting is about a girl named Winifred and her family who own the wood, where a spring is not noticed by anyone but Tuck family, a family that drank from this fountain of youth. Winnie decides to run away and takes the path to the wood where she gets kidnapped. It turns out she gets to know the people who live in the wood and become good friends with the people. Later in the story she finds herself helping a murderer out of jail. I like this book because it's got a little bit of action heart warming moments."
5,Tuck Everlasting,This is a very good book. Natalie Babbit can take all kinds of things and make them very interesting. It is about a girl whogoes through various adventures in a very short amount of time. You should read it.

5,dakota's,This a rell oak book . But I liked it it was really interasting I mean it was cool . the tuck are really nice pepole.I liked the book becuse it was interesting.....
5,11 year old boy,Tuck Everlasting was one of the best book I ever read in my life. My favorite caracters was Jesse and Tuck. My favorite part in the book was when Mae hit the man in the yellow suit with a shotgun.This book is very adventureous.I think it would not be good to live for ever because then the earth would be over populated. I thought it would very discustingwhen Jesse porposed to Winnie.If you are board all the timeyou could try to find this book somewhereand read it.
5,Tuck Everlasting,Tuck Everlasting is a good book.Most people think that Tuck Everlasting is based on basicly a romantic love story but actuly Tuck Everlasting is an fun adventure book. It does have a little romantic plt but at the same time it is fun and exiting.
3,My Review for Tuck Everlasting,I thought that thas book was a pretty good book. It was a little boring at times. The only parts I really liked were the beggining and the end. I only liked these parts of the book because at the end there was a lot of action and it made you think. I also only liked the beggining because the author made it exciting by saying that Winnie got kidknapped.
3,Tuck Everliving,"~~~Tuck Everlasting is a very magical and creative book. In the beginning I thought it could be a little more suspenseful but as you read on, it became more interesting. While I read this book it made me wonder how it would actually be like living forever. At the beginning of the book I mostly thought that is was cool knowing you could see the future but what about all my friends, soon they would pass away and you would always look the same. I think this book was a pretty good book because it made you think about what would happen if you were in there position. I would recommend reading this book to little children because it is very magical and exciting. I also like this book because you could never predict what was really going to happen next.~~~"
4,interesting... different...,"I have had this book for a few years. Days would pass and it would get dusty and dustier. Last week, I was watching Disney. I saw the advertisement for the movie and decided to read the book. It is a very short book so it took me a day to read it. Another incentive was that the author (Natalie Babbitt) lives right near me in Providence, Rhode Island. This book centers on Winnie Foster who is protected by her family in a small wooded town. A mysterious family takes her and tells her a family secret. I wont tell you it because it'll ruin the book for you! This is a tale of mystery, murder, kidnapping and robbery!It is very well rounded! I recommend it for a quick read!"
2,Tuck Neverlasting,I didn't like this book and I would call this book dull and a snore. I didn't like this book but lots of people did.
2,A Circle of Sleep,"Tuck Everlasting also known as the circle of sleep was not a very good book in my opinion. It had very little action, and had very little realistic scenes. All, in all I think that book would make people sleep."
4,This book is a great book you wont be able to put down.,"I read the book called Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt. It was a very good and suprising book. I gave it four stars because it is a very well written book with a great group of characters. It is about a girl named Winnie Foster. It takes place in the early 1900's, in the summer. One day Winnie meets a family, Angus, Mae, Miles and Jessie who can live forever. They drank from a spring 87 years ago and have not changed since then. No one knows their secret but Winnie and the family. If anyone knew about the spring who knows what would happen. Now Winnie has to keep their secret. My favorite part was when Winnie sees Jessie drink from the spring and she wants to drink it too. Then the family tells her all about the spring. She is not sure that she believes it. It was a very good book and it is one of my favorites. It is a very worthwhile book and everyone should read it."
4,A Book Review on Tuck Everlasting by Landon,"Natalie Babbit is a great author and writes wonderful books. Tuck Everlasting is a great children's book about a girl named Winnie Foster who lives in Treegap. She decided to runaway so she went into the wood behind her house that her family owns. There she ran into the Tucks, and found the magic spring. She sees Jesse drinking out of the spring and she tries to, but Jesse yells for Mae. When Mae gets there she tries to convince Winnie not to drink out of the spring. After that they kidnapped Winnie, so they could explain to her about the spring. The spring makes stay the same age you are when you drink it. I think it was a good fantasy fiction book! It was an interesting because of the spring that makes you younger. I think anybody that reads this book will like it."
4,A good book for everyone to read.,"The book, Tuck Everlasting,by Natalie Babbitt is a good book because a little girl that is 10 years old wants to run away. She sees a man and his last name is Tuck drinking from their water she told him she wanted to run away. The Tucks took her and a man in a yellow suit told her mom and grandma so he could trade the water for the girl. If the man got the girl then he could have the water but instead something very bad happened to the man.-by Natasha"
3,Tuck Everlasting Revieew,The book Tuck Everlasting is not a good book ans not a bad book.It is abut this girl who finds out a secret about this spring in the wood her parents owned. She has to decide whether she will drink from it or not.
1,"Uggggh, this book was the worst thing I have EVER read!!!!!","I HATED THIS BOOK!!! IT WAS BORING AND IT HAD NO POINT. THE ENDING WAS THE WORST PART!!! IT JUST ENDS!!! NOTHING SPECIAL, WELL, DISCLUDING THE EVERLASTING TOAD."
3,Tuck Evelasting,"Cute story. not long but written well with a good moral. Not the happiest of endings (wanted Jesse and Winnie to stay together...although it would ruin the story) Very good story and ultimately a very good read. If you are looking for something more challenging though, you may want to read this on your spare time (with no other books to read) Still, you would enjoy reading this book."
1,Tuck forever boring,"First Winnie was going to run away, then she wen to the woods and met a boy. She was kidnapped and a man saw it all. The man went to town and told the constable after he folowed them to their house. Mae went to jail and Winnie went witth the Tucks to switch places with Mae. Winnie didn't drink the bottle of water.I didn't like the book because it was boring and stupid. It was adventurous, but I think it didn't have a point. It had a bad ending and was a short story. The characters were kind of plain."
1,Boring Book,I think that this book is a waste of time and money. It was very boring. If you hate book with little action and no good scenes then this is not a good book for you. If you like book that have happy endings don't read it. The ending stinks.
1,TUCK EVERBORING,"I think that Tuck Everlasting is the most boring book in all of history. It was so boring I don't even think it deserve's a rating. I think customers should get a refund and teacher's should have never even thought about buying or even reading it to students. I think that watching Barney or even Teletubies is a lot better than reading this book. It should be called ""Tuck Everboring"". I fell asleep like 6 times during the book."
1,this bookling,"i do not understand the dorogatory statments in this, i like the man in the yellow suit i think he should drink the water and him and winnie should run away together, meaning that they should both drink the water. i also think that mae has gone crazey and thats why she hit the man in the yeller suit."
3,derek douk,"and you needed to discrbe the character more. Out of all the books i read,this wasn't that good.I would like to recommend this book to a person that like fantasy and long chapter books.That's all the time i have so thank you for writing this book.P.S.: I hope you right book that people could read."
4,THE BOOK REVIEW,I think the author did a great job writing the book because it is a great book.I liked this book because it was full of excitement and daring scenes.
3,The Mysterious Man in The Yellow Suit By Matt Diglio,"I thought it to be an ok book. Some may call it sketchy, others may call it ""weird"". But the idea behind Natalie Babbit's novel is an ok book. If you are offered the chance to live forever, offered the chance to sacrifice something for something that could change the world. Would you do it? That's what Winnie Foster is faced with. My mind could see the pictures in the story but sometimes was blurry in some spots of the story. It was well written with not too much action though. The Man in the Yellow suit didn`t have a name so it kind of made him mysterious. The break out of jail was way two easy for Mae, the plot was kind of weak. The theme was too much in your face. I also think the story ended before the book did, also the characters needed a little more info behind them. I suggest you can read it if you please to, but don't expect it to end happily ever after. I admire Natalie Babbit for her bravery in writing on such a subject."
4,"I really liked it, but I disliked the ending","Some may call it sketchy, others may call it ""weird"". But the idea behind Natalie Babbit's novel is an incredible one. If you are offered the chance to live forever, offered the chance to sacrifice something for something that could change the world. . . would you do it? That's what Winnie Foster is faced with.My mind could see the pictures in the story. . . it was well written with not too much action. There was enough break and natural stopping to keep it from being ""Fast Fast Fast Fast, sort of Fast, Fast Fast Fast"" as many books are. I suggest you read it, but don't expect it to end happily ever after. It's well written, and I admire Natalie Babbit for her bravery in writing on such a subject."
3,the book of life,"The book Tuck Everlasting is written by Natalie Babbitt. It is about a girl who has to keep the biggest secret in the world. She lives next to a wood, but what she didn't know was that there is a spring there that can give you everlasting life! Characters: Winne, Jesse, Mae, Tuck, Mom, Dad, Miles, Grandmother, and the man in the yellow suit.This was one of the better books I have read. I liked it because I liked the story line and all the charaecters. It kept wanting me to read because it was so good. It was a good book."
3,Crazy,"When having a normal life and not knowing what age you stop at when drinking from a magic spring and staying the same age for eternal life and never die, the Tuck family wander about trying to live as comfortably as they can. When a ten-year-old girl name Winnie Froster stumbles on their secret, the Tucks take Winnie home and explain to her about living forever at one age is less a blessing than it might seem. A stranger who follows Winnie and the Tuck family home and hear's about a magic spring water than wants to market the spring water for a fortune.If you want to read more about this book check out Tuck Everlasting any where.I recommed this book because its funny, its interesting also it's a great novel to read to kids and yourself. And it gives knowledge about what's right and wrong."
2,Tuck Everlasting....,"Though I love the idea and story of this book, I didn't particularly like the way the story was told. It is a little over 100 pages. I know this is a young children's book but they are learning nothing by reading the bare minimum of the strong subject matter of immortality. Except for Winnie, the character depth of the Tucks only skimmed the surface. I would have loved to read more about the in-depth feelings that each family member was having. All in all, the story was over in the wink of the eye. Events and occurances slammed right against the next, hardly giving a moment to consider what was going on. A little more storytelling would have helped this book reach its full potential."
3,Why [I] Like's Tuck Everlasting,I like Tuck Everlasting becouse It inspired me how Winnie doesn't really go's out side.It also inspired me when Winnie met Jesse and Winnie was just about to drink some of the spring water and then Jesse told her not to... But what disgusted me was how Winnie told us how the Tuck's house looked like.Thank you very much for reading this...
2,My View of Tuck Everlasting,"Winnie Foster was just a little child who lived in a touch-me-not-cottage near a wood that her family owned. One day Winnie One day Winnie ventured into the woods, coming upon a little clearing she had never seen before, with a boy sitting on the ground drinking from a spring arching up out of the ground. The boy and his family kidnaps her, and the Tucks tell her that they can live forever. First Winnie thinks that these people were crazy kidnappers, but gradually realized that they were telling the truth. A man that always wore a yellow suit figured out the Tuck's secret, and he wanted to sell the spring water for profit. The Tuck's ended up getting away, but Mae had to club the man in the yellow msuit in the head.This book was an ok book, but i'm not a big fan of it. Natalie Babbit did a great job at describing places like Winnie's house, the wood, and the Tuck's house. The story itself was kind of corny. I didn't like how Winnie gave the toad the spring water either."
2,The Eternal Story of Winnie Foster and the Tucks,"Tuck Everlasting is a story of a 10 year-old girl who meets an incredible family. The Tuck family had been granted a magical, and sometimes miserable, gift. They drank from a magical spring and were given eternal life. This story contains such things as a stranger in a yellow suit, a kidnapping, a horse and a toad, a touch-me-not cottage, a new jail house, and a long-forgotten shot gun.I personally did not enjoy reading this book as much I have enjoyed reading other books because it had many dull moments and when it finally did get exciting, it only lasted a brief moment. The story line wasn't that bad but the way some parts of the story were phrased didn't appeal to me as much. It was an ""ok"" book for the most part, but it definitely wasn't my favorite."
2,An Okay Book (Sort of),"This book was about a little girl named Winnie Foster. She went out exploring her wood one day, when she finds a clearing with a small spring. There was also a boy there. They introduce themselves. The boy's (Jesse's) whole family comes and takes Winnie to their house. Then Jesse's mother, Mae, shot a man, so she went to jail. The Tucks and Winnie help Mae get out of jail.I liked some parts of the book because they were exciting and interesting. Other parts were just pointless or boring. One interesting part was when Mae shot the man in the yellow suit. That was both interesting and exciting."
2,I didn't really like it,"I didn't really like the book. I thought it was pretty boring. The first chapter was about a road and cows. I payed attention, but I felt like I could have slept through it! I mean Winnie talked to a toad! In my opinion it was a bad book!"
2,not so good,I personally though the book wasn't very good. It was sort of confusing and weird at the same time. I think it would be better for girls than boys. But there was a lot of people who did like it so I guess give it a try.
2,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting wasn't my favorite book. I thought it was slow and boring at first and it took a while before I could get into it. This book didn't have any cliff hangers, and it didn't make me want to read the next chapter. I wouldn't suggest it for a boy because it isn't exciting enough. It is the type of book that a girl would like because the main character is a girl."
3,sweet book,it was a very sweet story. im glad i bought it at a cheap price. hopefully my kid can enjoy reading it someday.
2,"This book was a good read, however, it lacked the elements of a good book","I read 'Tuck Everlasting' in sixth grade, and while reading it, noticed that it lacked the basic elements of a good book. The first thing I noticed that the book seemed to be -if I may- condensed. My point being, the book had a lot of potential, it could have been better. Natalie Babbit, in my opinion, should have made the book about TWICE the size it is now, that way she could include more details, and maybe even make the story continue, after the frog becoming eternally alive. If you want to see for yourself, read the book, and decide whether or not you agree with me."
4,Great,tuck everlasting is enchating and ponders questions about life.babbitt is a unique author and no one can copy her writting style.
5,TUCK EVERLASTING,"This book, Tuck Everlasting, was a great book. Natalie Babbitt makes up a wonderful, unbelievable fairy land. There is a girl named Winnie. Wanting to run away by the thought of always doing everything. She owns a wood. In there is a spring that Winnie never knew about. A boy , a mysterious boy is drinking from that spring. Now the boy is scared that she might know his secret-- that he is immortal and his family has an eternal life from drinking from the magical spring. His family has to take her away now that she knows the secret. They thought she might tell. Unbelievably, a nameless man with a yellow suit hears everything that they talk about in the wood. When Winnie is taken away, he follows them everywhere, without them knowing,"
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting, by Natalie Babbitt is one of the most well-written books I've ever read. It is about a girl named Winnie Foster who comes across a""Fountain of Youth"". Before she can drink from it, Winnie is kidnapped. The story mainly branches off from there. I liked how Mrs. Babbitt describes different things in different ways. I really could picture what was going in the different parts of the story. I think Mrs. Babbitt was telling us that if you ever want somathing very bad, you'll eventually get it. But you won't like it, as it comes with a price.You should read this book."
3,It Stinks like my dirty gym sock,I did not like this book although it was a romance because i like romance books.I dont like them all.
5,"Beautifully conceived, wonderfully executed",There's nothing I like better than finding a great read! This was wonderful through and through. I've shared this with many young readers and they've all be captivated by the story. I only hope the big screen does justice to the magic of the book.
5,Changed my love for reading,I was not a fan of books until I read this one! I love how they find out if she drank from the spring or not.I also love how the toad some how plays a huge role in this book.You could get lost in this book and read for hours and hours and hours.Once I finished the book I was so depressed because I thought I could never find a book that was as good or better than the book Tuck Everlasting.Even if you hate books you will find yourself attached to this one!I would highly recomend this book and read the book before you see the movie!
5,everlasting,"This book is one of the best books. You never know what to expect. It is awesome how it end's. This book is about a girl who wonders of into the woods one day. She finds herself lost but a dareing young man finds her and takes her back to his family. They were your typical family, but they have an amazing secert. The family found a spring one day traveling, this sgring makes you live forever. Will Winny drink the water from the spring or will she go home? To find out you have to read this amazing adventurous book. It is for all ages."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"I thought Tuck everlasting was a great book. It made me really think about life and death. Before I read this book, I would have probably wanted to live forever. This book really makes you think twice about wanting to live forever. Most kids would mostlikely want to be immortal. This book is a good way of persuading them not to. Living forever was really not meant to be. Thats why we don't, and this book explains why."
5,This is the best book!,"last year, i read this book for something we did in class. when i read it, it just had an engaging plot and it was hard to put down. it just jumped right in to the plot, and after that it didn't become boring. Tuck Everlasting's author also wrote many other good books, just as engaging. i think this was the best one because it was a good mystery."
4,Avery Bowen's excellent review,"Tuck Everlasting is a great book. Natalie Babbit did a good job of combining suspense, action, and mystery. It kept me wondering if Winnie would drink the water. The book has so many surprises, but you'll have to read the book to find out what they are. I wish the book would've ended differently, but it didn't. I also didn't understand why Tuck said ""Good girl"" at Winnie's grave. You'd think Tuck would want Winnie to drink the water. I highly recommend this great book."
3,A very good book to read for fun,When I started to read the book it was boring but at the end the book got better.My favorite part was when Winnie told the dog to shoo.It was weird when Winnie gave the toad all of the water from the spring.Winnie was nice when she helped the Tucks set Mae free from jail.But it is a very good book to read.
2,Unnamed Charecter,"I did not like Tuck Everlasting it was boring and had too much detail in it. It didn't tell who was the man in the yellow suit? I did not like this book, but you might so read this book."
2,A book of fantasy and wonder,I really did not like this book because it was too detailed and boring. Natalie loves to describe but thats just not my type. Who is the man in the yellow suit anyway? He just apeeared. I disagree with some of you who say the book isn't detailed enough this book is way to detailed. I like a book that gets right to the story and does not drag on about the first thing in the book. I didn't like this book but maybe you will so read the book and find out.
2,Spring of life,"I did not realy like this book. Tuck Everlasting was too pradictable. Also it wasnt very detailed. I wouldn't suggest this book to any of my friends. If you like to figure out books before the end, read this book"
5,Memorable,I read this bookTuck Everlastingin the last 80's when I was in grade school which became my favorite book for a very long time. Today is in #3 on my list of all time favorites. Today I am buying it for my 8 year old daughter who has been the highest reader in her class since kindergarten. I hope she'll get the same enjoyment and everlasting favoritism that I do today as an adult.
3,Well written but disappointing,Tuck everlasting is a very well written story that I really enjoyedbut it has an extremely sad ending. I would give it 5 stars but for the ending.
5,Tuck Everlasting Book Review by Travis Twins,"The book, ""Tuck Everlasting"" by Natalie Babbitt was a first-rate fantasy novel. The main theme in the book was the circle of life. Natalie Babbitt asked questions about life and death. The book was about a family that will never die. I liked it when Mae hit the men in the yellow suit in the back of the head. I didn't like it when Mae went to jail. My favorite quote in the story is, ""Do not be afraid of death. Be afraid of the unlived life."""
4,Tuck Everlasting,"I really liked this book. It was not a bad book at all. Except for some parts that I could not understand it that well, Well that is all I have to say about this book."
1,Of Fosters and Tucks,"Winnie Foster is a 10-year-old girl, almost 11.She is always overly protected by her mother, grandmother, and father. She makes friends with a toad, and tells it that she will run away before next morning. She gets foud by the Tucks. Mae kills the Man in the Yellow Suit, and she goes to jail. She breaks out of jail, and the Tucks are on the run."
1,tuck ever lasting,this book is ok but it is not something I would not recamend this book because I think the ending sucked. I had to read this book in class and to tell you that there is no action in it.It stunk like my gym socks.If your name is joe read it.Joes number is (317) 535-9535
4,"An ""Everlasting"" story!","This book is starts out slow and gradually gets much more interesting as it goes on. I bought this book several years ago and read the first chapter, but thats as far as I got because that had to be one of the most boring chapters I've read in my life. About a week ago, I was bored and looking for something to read and I decided to try this book again. I started reading and couldn't put it down.The book details the story of a ten year old girl who comes across a spring that grants anyone who drinks from it in the woods her family has owned for years and years. The problem is, when the family who originally discovered the spring finds out she knows the location, they decide she can't tell anyone. Meanwhile, a mysterious man in a yellow suit is also trying to discover the location of the spring so, he can exploit it and make a fortune. I would recommend this to someone between the ages of 10-12 for a very fast and easy read."
3,My Review For Tuck Everlasting,I thought this was an okay book. In the beggining of the book it was boring. But in the middle it was better. The end was not that great. I was dissopointed it just ended. I thougth overall it was an ok book. I might recommined this to someone.But it is not on the top of my faviorate list of books.
3,Tuck Everlasting,"In the woods of the Fosters , live the Tucks. they live a very happy life. untill a manin ayellow suit is serching for a speshel famly.when May go's into townevry ten year to meet her two sons, Miles and Jesse. as she sit on the back of her wagon wing her music box, Miles and jesse come runing to her.i really like this book becouse it's full of pashon and exsitemet."
4,Tuck Everlasting,Are you interested in love or in fantasy? If so you will love Tuck Everlasting.It is about the Tuck family and one normal girl named Winnie. She goes in the wood and finds the Tucks' young son Jesse.The Tuck family drank the magical water that makes them stop chang and geting older. Winnie meets Jesse and has to decide whether to drink the water or live on until her death.
3,TUCK EVERLASTING,"If you like mystical woods and people runing away from home, then you should go and get Tuck Everlasting By Nattlie Babbit.Winnie is sick of not being able to go past the fence that goes around her house. But one day Winnie runs away and sees a boy in the woods drinking from a spring bubbling out of a tree. She was so thirsty she wanted some water and if Jesse Tuck didn't stop her from drinking it her life wouldn't be the same.There is a family called the Tuck's and their the one's Winnie stays with for awhile. There is a man that is following Jesse and Miles Tuck. He is trying to find out the family secret.I liked the book because it had some action in it and I disliked the book because it was sort of a love story, but I recommend this book to someone who likes action mixed with love stories.SWOMPDONKEYS"
2,Tuck Everlasting 2000 edition with interview,"Tuck Everlasting was a mediocre book. One thing I wondered about is how, if the tree was supposed to be affected by the spring, they were able to carve into the bark. I wondered how lightning destroyed it, but Ms. Babbitt tried to explain that in the interview. Actually, the interview was pretty disturbing, and marred my opinion of the book. I have laid out a pretty extensive critique of particular parts of the interview [on my website] The book, all in all, was mostly harmless, but shouldn't we strive for more than mostly harmless?"
3,Tuck Everlasting Book Review,"Tuck Everlasting was a good book. I read it with my class and I thought it was okay. I thought it could have been written better though. I won't give anything away, but some parts, sad to say, pretty boring. For example the beginning, it wasn't that exciting and didn't really ""hook"" me into the book. After reaching the end of the book I realized it wasn't so bad afterall. Still, I wish my class could have read something more exciting and full of action and adventure! That's my kind of book! Sadly, this just wasn't my kind of book and well, I didn't hate it, but it was okay I guess. Anyway books are hard to write, right? So I guess I could give Natalie Babbitt, the author, some credit for writing the book."
1,Forced to read ... Also very boring,"I did not like this book at all.I think it is too romatic.I think Harry Potter is better than this book and I don't like him either.I don't recommend this book to anyone who reads this ""RE-VEIW""."
1,THE BOOK THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT,"There are many books that you can read. But if there is one book you don't read, make it Tuck Ever lasting. This isn't a very good book. The plot is okay, but I thought the characters were a little weak and weren't described enough. Some chapters were a little long, and others were a little short. That is my review."
1,dumb short book,"we read this book in class last year, in 6 grade. the story line was predictable and the weirdest part was when 17 year old jesse preposed to a 10 year old girl. and then to top it all of winnie (the main character) dies in the story!!! the reason i gave this story 1 star is because it was a better book then any other book we read last year in class (if i could rate those they would get half a star or less)"
3,"Freaky, but boring","Winnie is a girl who finds a family who lives in the woods, and they drank from a well that makes you immortal and they can't get older or die and they are bored! Was I the only kid who was forced to read this in 5th grade?"
1,Tuck Everlasting,"TUCK EVERLASTINGWritten BY: Natalie BabbittThis book is about a girl named Winnie Foster.She is 11 years old and was kidnapped. She is gone for a day and a half before being found.She learns that in the woods her father owns there is a magical spring that keeps you from aging. Winnie lives in a"" touch me not"" cottage . and it is the first week in August one day Winnie is running away in the process she gets ""kidnapped"" then the kidnappers tell her about the spring . one day goes by and then there is a knock on the door and a stranger comes in to take Winnie home. But she dose not want to go.Fin out what happens read on and find out the rest!! I really liked the book it had a lot of adventure!!!(...)"
3,Donkey,"When I first started reading Tuck Everlasting, I thought it was boring. Towards the end it started to get exciting. Overall, it was all right and I would recommend it."
2,"Boring in the beginning, interesting in the end....","In the beginning of the book, it was so boring. Why was it boring? There was nothing exciting and no action. There was like no violence until close to the end, and only like one person died.In the end, it was exciting. There was a kidnapping, there was a murder, and there was a whole family that couldn't die.The most exciting part of the book was the murder, but you'll have to read the book to find out what happens.If you like action, violence, and hot romance, don't read this book. If you like descriptive paragraphs, then this book is for you. Maybe part of the reason I didn't like this book was because it was so old and the ending wasn't what I expected.Peace out."
1,Tuck Everlasting Review,Tuck Everlasting was a good book. In the beginning there is two families' the Tucks and the Fosters. The Tucks are a family who can't die because they drank water from a spring that made them live forever. The Fosters are a family that has one daughter Winnie.After some confrontation with a stranger Winnie finds herself a mission to get Mae out of jail.This story takes place in a lot of places. In the beginning the story took place in Tree gap. In the middle the story took place in the woo. Finally the story ended in the jail house when Mae had some confrontation with the stranger .In the very end (epilogue) the story took place many years later Jessie finds out some events that make him happy and sad.This was a good book to read so when you get a chance buy it and read it. Well that's all folks.
3,My Review for Tuck Everlasting,I liked the book but in some parts they were boring me to tears and others made me very excited.
3,Tuck Everlasting By Adam,I think the book was very good it made me want to ceep reading it the end could be beter but other than that it was good i wish ther was more books so if natalie babbitt is reading this you need to make a nother book i will read all of them so will you make some more please and make the end beter i liked the part when winny poured the water on the toad and the end when they saw winnys grave then when angus said good girl because she did not drink the water that was the part that i liked the best so as you can tell i loved the book and i still whant to read more... so you kids need to read it
4,Good and detailed book,Life is full of choices. Big and small. Tuck Everlasting is an intresting book with big choices. It is about a girl who runs away because at her house they watch every single thing she does. She runs away in the woods and finds the Tucks who have drank the water and are now immortal. Along comes a man who wants to bottle and sell the water and make a fortune. Now Winnie has to make a choice between the endangered Tucks or her boring family that gives her no privacy. Tuck Everlasting is a good book that shows people that wrong choices lead to bad things.
4,The True Facts of Tuck Everlasting,"This book is really great for the most part. The theme of the novel is truly a noble one. It really makes you think. The characters are well-developed,and the descriptions are wonderful. It's a little boring at the beginning, but it really picks up. I like this book, but there are a few not-so-great things about it.Like I said before, the beginning is boring. It also doesn't describe Winnie's thoughts about whether to drink the water or not. There wasn't really that much action in it either.If you want a nice romance, don't read the book, watch the movie! However,the book does supply a lot of character interactions and feelings that the movie does not.This book is filled with adventure, mystery, intensity, fun, excitement, and much, much, more! I recommend this to almost everyone. Don't read this book if you are under 9 because you wont grasp the concept as well, and you wont be able top truly understand the meaning of this book."
5,Oh what a wonderous life,"This book is great! it shows what love can do to you! Love in mysterous...i would tell you more..but if you even know what a good book is, you will read this...i can't say more or i will give the book away!!! Good Readin!!"
2,Boring,"This book is boring. I had to read it for school. The idea of people living forevor is inturesting enough, but the way it was used here sucked. I cant believe people actually said this was the best book they ever read."
2,Confusing and lacking excitement.,"The book I was reading was about the Tuck family, Winnie, everlasting life on earth, what it would do if everyone knew about it and how it would affect all the people on earth . It was a little confusing for me, but I still read it, and I would not recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good book. This book starts off in Winnie's grandparents' house, and they are neat freaks. Winnie is starting to be a neat freak, but she is mad at her grandparents. So when she bumped into someone in the bush near a spring, she asked if she could have some water but the person said no. They had an argument, but she lost the argument because she was kidnapped. They took her to tell her what would happen if she had a drink of the water that was in the spring and why she has to keep it a secret from everyone-even her grandparents."
5,Class of 6th graders loved Tuck!,"I teach 3 sections of 6th grade language arts at a middle school in central Michigan. The vocabulary and sentence structure of this novel was a stretch for some of the students, but the theme prompted insightful, personal discussion of everlasting life. The symbolism was enjoyed by many who, having read the book at a younger age, had missed much of it. Students enjoyed the unfolding of the characters and the conflict. Good read and great discussion!"
2,Boring and preachy with numb characters,"This is one case where I can judge a book by its cover. The story is as dull and lifeless as the cover illustration. The plot line is very simple and the characters were generally very unrealistic and numb to the world. Winnie seems like a very dull child, and the ominous man with the yellow suit is an extremely one-dimensional bad guy. (I wonder if he knew Curious George's friend, the man with the yellow hat.) Overall, the book deals with the issue of death in a very preachy and obnoxious manner. Certainly not a book I would use with my students."
4,Tuck Everlasting is an Everlasting Book,"In this exciting tale, young Winnie, a sheltered and curious child, meets the Tucks, a family that have a slightly out of the ordinary trait. The Tucks, a Mom, Dad, and two sons, have drunk from a magic well, and now they will never grow old, never change, and most importantly... never die. When 13-year old Winnie runs away and spends a few days with the Tucks, she learns their secret. She is the first, and only outsider to know. Then, Mae Tuck kills a man threatening the family, and is given the death sentence. Winnie and the rest of the Tuck family must spring Mae from jail before the sun rises... because she won't die when they try to kill her, and then the Tuck's closely guarded secret will be out. Natalie Babbitt spins this tale into a refreshing mix of love, adventure, and desperation. I would recommend this book for children ages 7-11."
5,Brittany's Words on Tuck Everasting,Tuck Everlasting was one of the best books I ever read.The way Natalie Babbit wrote the book really captured my attention. The way she explained every little detail is very comforting. It was one of the best books I have ever read. It's one of those books that keeps you guessing to the end. I hope everyone enjoys this wonderful book.
5,Tuck Everlasting,"This is a very exciting book.It was about a girl namedWinnie who went to the woods that her family owned.Shemet a boy named Jesse.Then when his family took her awayand told her their deep,dark secret.There was also a manwho heard it and decided he would use it to get money.Read it,read it,read it!!!!!!!!"
3,Tuck Everlasting,"I think Tuck Everlasting is mainly about a girl named Winnie(Winifred) Foster. She some how finds this family named the Tucks, who tell her a secret that has to do with a little spring that is special. Winnie spends a couple of days with the Tucks and gets very close to them. The have to leave because people think that they are weird. Winnie becomes sad, but misses her parents and is glad to come home. Over all, I thought the book was not the best book I had read, but was still really good. If you like adventure books, this book is good for you."
5,Awesome Book,It was such a good book that I didn't want to put it down. It is a fantastic book. It is also intriguing.
2,Not good,"I read this in 5th grade. I'm not in 5th grade now, but I didn't like it. Blech. There was no detail, and if there was, most were vague. I liked the ""twist"" to the story, but that took about 1 chapter. I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry Babbit!"
5,This book was almost impossible to put down!,Tuck Everlasting is a great book. If their were 10 stars I would give it 11. It's amazing how Whinnie the main character changes from being a spoiled brat to a brave savior. It also has a good punch of action in it. It makes you think about the bad parts of having eturnal life.
4,Man in the yellow suit,I thought the novel Tuck Everlasting was a really rich book. And from this whole book I thought the most interesting thing is how heaven and earth colided ........... it was a good book.
4,"Tuck Everlasting is a great, great book",I like Tuck Everlasting the story is very creative. I like how the described the top of a ferris wheel like the top of August! I hope there will be more books like this one!
4,Tuck Everlasting: Great book,"I think Tuck Everlasting is one of the best books I've ever read. The reason I say this is because I've never read a book that was so...I guess you could say mysterious...? There was just something about it that was different. I guess when I read the epilogue, it sort-of changed the story around a little bit. I guess I wish Winnie would have drinken the water from the spring and gone to be happy with Jesse forever. Anyway, I give the book 4 stars."
4,A Mystery!,"Tuck Everlasting was a good book! We read it at school for a comprtition! It was kind of confusing and you really have to pay attention to what you're reading or you won't understan it! It is a good book with humor, kidnapping and a lot of other stuff! It is a fictio book by plenty! Tuck Everlasting is about a a family who drank this water that made them live forever, but not look any older! They kidnappe this girl, but aren't trying too! Find out what happends in Tuck Everlasting!"
2,My opinion of Tuck Everlasting!!!,"For reading my class and I read the book Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt. I thought the book was OK!! I mean in the begging it was boring, but tword the middle and end it got a little better. It was about a girl named Winnie who never went in their familys woods. So one day she went in the woods and meat a boy who changed her life forever. I reccomend this book to people who likes adventerest books because it is very adventerest. I'd give the book 2 stars out of 5."
2,Not my type of book.,"This book was okay. I didn't love it, but I didn't fall asleep. I think this book is better suited for girls 10 and up. Personally, I thought it was a little slow-paced."
4,This is a great book!,I think this was a very entertaining book.It kept me wondering about things like is Winnie ganna drink the water!I was curious about that through almost the whole book!I never thought it would end that way!I wish it wouldn't have.I wish the ending would have been entirely different!Overall i thought the book was pretty good & i inspire you to read it if you havent yet!This book will keep you entertained & you will not want to stop reading it!I give this book 4 stars!
4,the ending could be better,"(...)MY OPINION ABOUT THE BOOK IS,IT COULD HAVE HAD A LITTLEBETTER ENDING.I MEAN,THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD IN ALL,BUT ITHINK THE ENDING COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC.THE PART I LIKE BEST IN THE BOOK WAS WHEN JESSE ASKED WINNIE TO TO WAIT TILL SHE WS SEVENTEEN AND THEN DRINK THE WATER.I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING PRT OF THE BOOK!"
4,A well written masterpiece,Tuck Everlasting will always be one of my favorites. It is carefully planned and twisty as a pretzel. I didnt like that they didnt use the man in the yellow suit more though. I would have liked to know his name!
5,Enchanting!,"I thought that ""Tuck Everlasting"" was so good. The movie has a lot to live up to. This novel really made you think about what would happen if you did live forever? It just opened a lot of questions & I'm sure others would agree. I think that the plot was so creative & it was very well written. It really was enchanting---I read it in 1 sitting & was mesmerized. I would recommend it to children & adults, in this case both can enjoy it. I really like the book & it was definitely woth while to read."
4,Tuck Everlasting a touching story,I think Tuck Everlasting is a good short story. It's about a girl named Winnie from a small town in August in the 1880's. She is walking threw her wood when she stumbles upon the fountain of youth. Next thing she knows. She is kidnapped by a family called the Tucks who had the drank water. A touching story that puts you in deep thought. I recommend you purchase this book.
4,Gloria,"I am reading Tuck Everlasting as part of a class project. Tuck Everlasting is a very good book although it `s not the book that make you want more, it is a book that makes you ask the question, ""Would I like to live forever?"" Natalie Babbit use of descriptive language makes this a very good book."
3,tuck everlasting the book or should it be?,Tuck Everlasting was a book i enjoyed. I didnt like it that much because i didnt feel like i was actually was in the book.My class mates I read the book that is really why i read it but it was an ok book at the end. I think now that it should be an everiasting book becasue it will be everiasting to me.
4,Tuck Everasting,"I thought Tuck Everlasting was an average book. On my scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a seven. It was about a girl named Winnie Foster. She soon runs away and gets kiddnapped. Then she meets the Tucks. When the Tucks fall into perils of their own, Winnie comes to help. Althogh she shattered her parents trust, she lives with a sense of pride for her actions."
2,Tuck Everlasting Review,"This book wasn't very exciting and didn't like the ending very much. I thought the main character was strange.She was just too perfect. It also was very unrealistic.The author didn't use vivid, motivating language. It seemed like the Fosters were isolated from the rest of the world. Towards the end, it got better, though I didn't care for the epilouge. It went very slowly for me. I couldn't picture it in my head at all. I would not recommed it. It was slow, boring, and dull."
3,Good Book,THis book was a preety good book but not enough action. I like books with more action but i do reccomend this book to people who enjoy a small amount of action.
3,Tuck Everlasting,"I thought that ""Tuck Everlasting"" is a pretty good book but I Thought that it needed some more action. My favorite part in the book is when Winnie helped Tuck escape from jail. They got away and didn't get caught.The book is about a girl who gets kidnapped. She gets told a secret. Then, after a while she got home. However, the person who kidnapped her went to jail and Winnie helped get him out because they became friends."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"My name is Charlyne and I read ""Tuck Everlasting"" in my class. I think it is a good book exept for a few times Natalie Babbit would go on and on about one subject, and it would get a little boring. I like books that are suprising, and ""Tuck Everlasting"" has a very suprising ending. I liked this book and I'm sure that you will too."
4,Eternal Life?,Eternal life? Is this real? No body knows but here's a book that tells a spring of water and we'll I'll let you find out but I will tell you there's a girl that brings it all together. So read this book Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt.
3,Very Good Book,"Would you ever find a magical fountain in the woods that would make you live for ever? Well, 10 year old Winnie Foster did. Also made friends along the way, and helps out people out of places. She also has a stranger following her. If this is a movie, I would rate it pg-13. PS: If you read this book already, read it again."
3,Very Good Book,"Would you ever find a magical fountain in the woods that would make you live forever? Well 10 year-old Winnie Foster did she also makes friends along the way. Also helps out people out of places, she also has a stranger following her. If this was a movie it would be rated PG-13. PS: If you read this book already,read it again."
5,Six stars!,"Tuck Everlasting is a very good book, full of adventure, mystery and fun. The characters all have different attitudes, from mean to loving. Things would be a lot different if everything lived forever. Tuck Everlasting is a great book that is definitely worth reading!"
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Winnie Foster is outside in her garden when she realizes that she is too proper,so she decides to runaway. She goesinto her father's forest when she sees Jesse and the spring. She goes to get a drink when Jesse says stop!!Then Mae,Miles,and Jesse took off with Winnie.They tell Winnie about the spring and you can live forever if you drink it, but though Winnie didn't believe them."
3,Ups and Downs about Tuck Everlasting,"I think this book is a pretty good book. It has a lot of details which help you picture what the characters look like. Sometimes it uses improper grammar so it is confusing. I recommend reading it for ages 8 and up or someone else to read it to ages 7 or down. ""Tuck Everlasting"" has an exciting theme but some parts slow down. This book has a little over one hundred pages. It comes back to a scene many years later and...Just kidding! You will have to find out what happens for yourself."
3,the best book their is!!!!!!,"I thought that the book was a great description of the tucks family. There wasn¡t anything you could not understand about the tucks. I would love to live forever like the tucks because you could live to be billions of years old an still look eleven. I liked how Natalie Babbitt talked about the importance of life and death. I did not like how she did not talk the Foster¡s names. She could have said them once. Yet it was pretty good .I liked it so.......You should ,too !! it is awesome!!!"
2,READ ONLY IF YOU ARE IN SOCIAL LOCKDOWN!!!!!,I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK FOR SCHOOL AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS HOW AMERICANS WOULD say BOR-ING natalie babbit may be an extremely talented author but this persons advice for her stay away from childrens books! it had no purpose and it could never happen and it got really annoying about the wheel!ithink she wrote it as a new challenge but the end result was not good not good at all!
2,Strange book. Not something I would strongly suggest,"This was a very strange and confusing book. It seemed too easy for my reading level. This book was about a family called the Tucks who discover a special water that makes them immortal. They also ""kidnapped"" a girl named Winnie who came to like them. This idea seemed too far out and didn't mahe sense. I, personally are more interested in mystery books. This book seemed a bit to short to describe things in detail and make an interesting story. This might be a good book for someone younger or someone who enjoys fantasy.Otherwise, Iwouldn't suggest reading this book."
4,great book!,"Great book! Young Winifred finds sixteen year old Jim drinking out of a spring. He tells her not to drink this water because it makes you live forever. He takes her home with him and exciting things follow, including Tuck Everlasting telling Winifred that living forever is not what it should be"
1,Didn't enjoy this book at all!,When i read this book i struggled through the story without being very interested. i had to read it for school and i think a 3 year old child's book would have interested me more then this one.
3,Tuck Not So Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting is the story of Winnie Foster, a 10 year old girl fed up with her family's insatiable thirst for perfection. In pursuit of an adventure filled with the dangers and monsters of her family's stories, she sets out into her family's woods. Instead, she finds a beautiful, merry forest, and the Tucks, a wonderful, kind family with an incredible secret. But a yellow-suited stranger threatens to destroy the Tuck's happiness and Winnie's forest. This book was very delicately and carefully written, which is good. It makes you think, long and hard. But the bad news is that it had many oppurtunities to be more interesting, and none were taken."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Liked the movieWhat impressed me: This was a nice little story, realistic with a bit of fantasy. Perfect for middle grade readers, with good writing, an interesting story and nothing too frightening as to offend sensitive readers.What disappointed me: The movie was so much better and I wasn't even a huge fan of the movie. The dynamics between Winnie and Jesse weren't weirdly creepy in the movie since she was older. The book had a bit more tension, but that was most likely caused by the modern times I was reading it in. The tension was caused by my constant wondering which one of the adults was a pedophile, murderer, etc. It's almost inconceivable to read about a little girl who is taken by strangers who don't have a horrible agenda hidden away.Recommended: Sure, if you didn't see the movie."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting was a good book,but it gave us too much info.It also makes you want to think more about the future.There where alot of good parts and some parts I did'nt like.Even though it was'nt a true story,Natalie Babbitt did a good job on making it Predictable.I don't know why Winnie did not drink the water from the spring,but I am glad that she did'nt drink the water.I don't think she would of liked it."
4,Tuck Everlasting Review,Tuck Everlasting is a great book. I liked the end of it the best because there was more action and suspense than in the begining of the story. I liked the way the author described everything;because there were no pictures.(I could almost see visions in my head!) My favorite characters were Winnie and Jesse. The only person I didn't like in this book was the man in the yellow suit.I'd recomend this book to readers who enjoy fantasy.
3,Not Good Not Bad,"Tuck Everlasting wasn't the greatest. Some scenes needed more explaining. It was hard to picture the Fosters in my mind. The one thing I think the book needed was excitment. At the begaining I thought it would be cool to live forever, but at the end I had changed my mind. It was the same with most of my classmates.End Transmission......"
2,This book is really bad!,i think this book is really bad because it is so dumb and when she was ten she was proposed to. she was not realistic to all the things that were going on like a ten year old could never take someone's place in jail and stuff.
2,Tuck Everlasting,Hey What up. I dont reccomend this book to anyone. If you want an honest opinion on Tuck Everlasting I do not reccomend this It is really weird. I personally dont like it. well see yaFrom KiwiannaDown Under
3,Tuck Everlasting,Madskillphil91. To me Tuck Everlasting was very boring in the beggning. If I was Winnie I would've said hey I'm only 11.AT the end it got preety exciting. My favirite character was the frog he was sweet
3,Joe's Review,"My name is Joe and I am in [...] grade. Tuck Everlasting is about a girl named Winnie, who lives in a house outside the Wood. Winnie wants to run away becasue her parents won't let her outside of the fence that surrounds her house. One day, Winnie leaves the fence and goes into the woods. She is kidnapped by a family because of what she saw them doing in the wood and taken back to the kidnappers house. At first, Winnie was afraid of her kidnappers, but then she learns that they are a nice family with a secret that they want to keep. Winnie has to decide if she should keep their secret or tell her parents what is in the wood and risk everyone finding out."
2,Too young for me...,"I probably would have liked this book a lot more if:A - I was 10 years youngerB - I hadn't seen the movie.I find this review hard to write because I don't want to cast a shadow on a perfectly good book. I imagine young children would love it and find it magical, but more me (I'm 21) I just found it a bit tedious. Especially since I knew the story. All that was really left was the writing style (lots of lots of descriptions, right down to the ripples in the water) which I found annoying.But I do recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12. Because it really explores the themes of life/death and living forever in a realistic manner."
3,Tuck Everlasting,This book takes you to a place where you could only dream the world was like.We never die! Though I liked the movie the book wasn't the bast. I wasn't into it like I was in the movie.I would recommend this book to someone who likes fairytales
1,ZACHARYSLAVENS,I THINK LITTLE KIDS WILL GIVE THE BOOK UP AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE PAGES. I HATE THE START OF THE BOOK. I'M 40 YEARS OLD. THE REST OF THE BOOK IS GOOD THOUGH. I LOVE THE PART WHEN THE MAN IN THE YELLOW SUIT TRYS TO RAN AFTER HORSE. I ALSO LOVE THE PART WHEN WINNIE ORDERS PIZZA AT PIZZA HUT. AND GETS A PUPPY NAMED JAKE. I'M 40.
1,boring,I think this book was boring and much too far fechted. Most of all this book was not fun to read. It didnt grab me and I think no one I know would like it. Its really stupid.
3,derek douk,"I really didn't like the book in the begining because it wasn't really exciting then you think. As I read on it became a little better.You started to give more information and more character pop out from nowhere.Sorry to say this but it didn't have a good ending. so that is why I gave it a three star for rating,but I would be glad to read another book that you wrote."
5,Esha Chennubhotla's Review!!! :),"Tuck Everlasting is a marvelous book! It has adventure, romance, fantasy, and more! But the best thing I like about the book Tuck Everlasting is that the author, Natalie Babbit,leaves you questioning in the end of each chapter. I think Tuck Everlasting is a great book for children to read. I think the best grade level to read this book would be 4th grade or above!"
3,Life Life Life,"My name is Keoki TM or k30k1. Overall the book was ok. A girl named Winnie Foster gets kidnapped by the Tuck's because the Tuck's knew that Winnie wanted to get away from her house. She has a choice to live forever. If someone gave me a bottle of spring water I would drink it. I would drink it because I would't like to die. Tuck Everlasting takes place in the woods. Winnie is a nice girl. The problem is that she doesn't take action. She only pops up when the Tuck's need her. Overall she is ok. The man in the yellow suit is strange because he wants to listen to other people. I really think he needs a life. The Tuck family (Mae, Angus, Miles, and Jesse) have a secret that they could live forever. If my family was like the Tuck's I don't see why people shouldn't know.If you like the book good for you."
4,Reveiw-good book,"A magic spring can cause a lot of trouble. When 10-year-old Winnie Foster finds out that the Tucks have everlasting life they have to take her home and convince her that living forever might not be as good as it sounds. When trouble arises, it's Winnie's choice to save the Tuck's, and the spring, from people who care only about themselves. Who would have guessed that a 10-year-old girl would have the choice to change the world...forever?"
3,Cute Story,"It's really a cute little story, set way back in the day. It's probably the shortest book I've ever read, and yet it did take me a little while to read it. I understand that back in the day, a lot of things were different and a lot of things weren't frowned upon as much as they are today, like a 17yr old wanting to (eventually) marry a 10yr old. There are certain aspects of the book that I disagree with, but I understand the overall meaning of the story, and will still share it with someone to read."
4,Great Book,"Tuck Everlasting is a very entertaining story, which you should read if you are interested. Overall it has a good theme and message. Also it has a wonderful plot and storyline. If you think you would enjoy reading a fantasy or romance novel you should read story!"
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Alex GarlandTuck EverlastingBy: Natalie BabbittThis is a book about a girl named Winnie who couldn't go outside much. One day Miles, Jessie, and Mae came and kid napped her. They took her to a spring. They told her about the magic of the spring and than took her to their house. Winnie and Tuck talked about what would happen if she told people about it. Will Winnie tell anyone? That's for you to find out.I think this book is and isn't interesting because their isn't much action. I like it because it kind of leaves you hanging at some chapters.I would probably recommend this more to adults because of the hard words and they can understand what's going on better."
3,Tuck not so Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting is the story of Winnie Foster, a 10 year old girl who has had enough of her family's insatiable thirst for perfection,and sets out into the woods owned by her family for an adventure with the dangers and monsters her family has told her about. Instead she finds a beautiful, merry forest and the Tucks, a wonderful, kind family with an incredible secret. But a yellow-suited stranger threatens to destroy the the Tuck's hapiness, and Winnie's forest. This book was very delicately and carefully written, which is a good thing. It makes you think, long and hard. The bad news is, it had many opportunities to be more interesting, and none of them were taken, which lessened the power of the book."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting is about four main charecters Winnie Foster,Mae,Jesse,and Tuck.The book is about this kind of special liquid that makes people stay the same age and cannot get old at all. One day Winnie Foster goes out of her garden and goes to the fountain and drinks's the special liquid. Mae see's her and takes her wiht them Mae, Tuck,and Jesse. After a w hile Winnie starts to like Jesse ''it's a little crush'' she said but then it got bigger and bigger.After you heve drink the water you will never be the same.This book is a raelly good book. Is one of those unique book's. The thing that makes me like this book is that it has action, adventure, and drama all at the same time.I also like this book for another reason how Natalie Babbitt the athour, describes her feelingsand her passion. Also it felt like if you were her."
3,Immortality isn't so Great,"Winnie Foster stumbles onto the Tucks secret,that they drank from a magic stream and can never die. They take back to their cottage and explain that immortality isn't all that great, but they were followed. Mae kills the stranger and is taken to be hung. Tuck, Miles, Jesse, and Winnie break Mae out and Winnie decides not to drink from the magic spring.The beginning was boring, but I liked the suspense in the last few chapters. I really liked the ending."
3,BORING BOOK,to me this book didn't have enough action except that mae hits a guy on his head and kills him.
3,good book,"My favorite character was Jesse.I liked him because he was adventerous and he was very kind to Winnie,he even asked her to marry him!Miles was as boring as heck because he had a wife and didn't even tell her about the water,and that's all he ever talked about,that and his two kids.By chapter nineteen,Mae Tuck had become so protective of Winnie,that she whacked the-man-in-the-yellow-suit in the back of the head when he triewd to take Winnie back to drink the water......."
2,boring,"This book goes on and on. When you look back on reading it, you can't remember anything except that a little girl met some people who drank water and lived forever, and it was boring. But some people really love this book."
4,At the End of each Chapter You were Forced to Turn the Page,"At the end of the year (6th Grade), we were at the end of our literature books. There was one more story, Tuck Everlasting. What an unbelieveable book. After every chapter, the whole class would urge our teacher to keep going. Our teacher told us not to read ahead. That shows the suspense in the story! Winnie started out as a character who was made to do EVERYTHING. In the beginning, Winnie wants to make a difference and at the end of the story she does. It was amazing how the author made everything related. One other thing, the name ""Stranger"" suits the eerie ""Man in the Yellow Suit"""
2,you should read it at some point in your childhood,"Although this book is considered a sort of classic children's story I must admit I was some what bored with it at times. The author did teach me to further appreciate life's cycle, but the way she went on describeing things in such great detail made me wonder if I should go on with reading it."
4,It's a very good book,This book is real good and kind of sad. It's about this girl that meets this boy's family that drank out of a magic fountain that kept them that age forever and would never die. The boy(Jesse) asks the girl to drink some water so they can stay together forever. I'm not gonna tell you the rest. I don't wanna spoil it. I suggest you read it. it's real da bombie!
4,The master review by Tyler and Mitch,"This book had good and bad descriptions on everything.I thought this book was good because it had descriptions of the things that needed them.It also had a lot of suspense,and pretty thrilling. I liked the suspense in the book because it kept me on the edge of my chair.It talks about the good and bad parts of life.I thought the circle of life was confusing in the prologue, believe it or not I read the prologue at least 12 times!!!!!!It was confusing in some parts but the parts you can understand are really kinda cool.I personally think that the characters were corny!!!!!,but if you like fantasy you will like this book,it is about a girl and people who couldn't die(the Tucks) and a stupid person.(the man in the yellow suit)!!!!!!!"
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Geared toward the middle grades, Tuck Everlasting is a modern fantasy novel that has characters that can easily be identified with, even if they can never die. The book is an easy read with a plot that keeps readers in suspense and wanting to know more. The overall theme that life is a wheel and should move on, teaches us that death is part of the journey and to not take living for granted."
1,book revier,I hqt it very monch I do not like at all it was boreing I holp you like it more ten I did winnei dies she gives the tode the water the tucks finds the toud in the roud tuck sas it mint thank it can live for ever but what he dous not know is it can winnei gives the water to the toued
2,like the sun shining bright on me only not.,this book is really boring and i thought the author should be more original and not give away the ending so easily. The plot was kind of dumb well it was ok. This story is about a girl that is either going to drink the magical water or not. I mean the author might as well told the reader right up front that she wasn't going to drink the water. There were some okay parts like when tuck described how they came to be who they are. But i still think that this story is real boring. The author could have lead you to belive that Winnie was going to do something completly differnt't than drinking the water. Well thats all I really wanted to get at in this story so good ridance.
1,Tuck Everlasting,"This book is not a good book.It stunk! You should not read this book because, there was absolutely no suspense.This book is very bad because there is also no action.It was also very preppy.It especially needs more suspense.It [smells]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,7th grade teacher's review,"I read the book with my seventh grade reading classes. They all loved it. Even though it's fantasy, they can relate to the characters' feelings. I think it made each of them stop and think about how precious life is and think twice about wanting to live forever. The book is full of beautiful language! Every chapter has several great examples of similes, metaphors and personification. I recommend this book to any sixth or seventh grade teacher who wants to ""hook"" thier middle school readers."
2,TE Review,"Tuck Everlasting is about a young girl named Winnie Foster who runs away from home into the woods. There, she finds one Tuck family and is offered eternal life. The question you find youself asking throughout the book is whether or not she accepts it.This book would have been a fast read for me had it not bored me so much. The plot was slow to develop, and was lacking in action. It seemed too much a fairy tale for my interest, and I feel I've outgrown books like these.I would recommend this book for fans of a more mystical type of novel. However, I would more strongly suggest just not reading this book and merely ponder the morality and ethicality of eternal life, because that is all the book, though being a displeasing experience, led me to do."
4,Lamont's Review,"I think Tuck Everlasting is a great book. Natalie Babbitt has a good imagination.I think Winnie Foster played a good part in her roles.I recommend you to read the the book first,then watch the movie.I hope you enjoyed my review,and enjoy the book."
1,Book Review,"Would you like to live forever?This book Tuck Everlasting tells you what it is like to be immortal. My personal opinion about this book is that it was good because it captured my attention.The main characters of the story were Winnie, the man in the Yellow suit and the Tuck family. The family consisted of Tuck,Miles,Mae,and Jesse. The Tuck family could live forever.Jesse licked to showoff by doing all these crazy stuff because he couldn't die.Tuck hated to live foreverand dreamt he was in heaven."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"My review for Tuck Everlasting the book is that it is excellent. The plot for the story is a young girl wanders off into the wood her family owns and meets a family named the Tucks. The Tucks tell her how they drank from a spring and can live forever. However it doesn't mean they like it. They wish so badly to die until one day they meet a young girl named Winnie Foster. Winnie is told not to tell about the Tucks. They think no one will find out but, there is a man in a yellow suit that does. You wouldn't believe what happens to those characters. I enjoyed this book."
2,News ON The Tuck Everlasting Story It's rated Low!,"Tuck Everlasting is a borining book, Charcters are borning.Winnie is lonley and is over proted by her parents. How ever by theend of the story. Winnie gives us a character that changes and grows,But...... .... Charcters step out of everyday life. In activepassive. The ending was surprising because I thought Winnie wouldcome back and vist Jesse. The book showed me that living foreverisn't the best thing that could happen to you, ..... I think themoral is that a wistful apperanision is as good as life. Also to liveyour life the fullest. ...."
3,Tuck Everlasting,"It is an excellent book to read. If you want something exciting "" Tuck Everlasting"" is the book for you. I really liked it. It's about a family that finds an eternal life spring and drinks it. Then a girl named Winnie Foster finds out about it."
5,READ ME!!,"I read the book ""Tuck Everlasting"". It is a great book and every one should read this book. The book is about a young girl named Winnie, who meets a wierd man in a yellow suit who wants to know if anyone wierd lives around there.Then she meets a boy named Jesse who's family has a ""BIG"" secret. Winnie finds that out when she sees him doing something wierd. After they get to know each other Winnie gets kidnapped by his family. When they get to a stream Winnie asks what did they do that for. then all the book starts to un fold. READ IT its a great book."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"I believe this book has a purpose of this book is not to listen to every one. Yes I agree because if some one told you to jump off a cliff. So you won't jump off a cliff.This is my result of what the author did best on. The thing she did best on was the characters. The reason is because she described them to the reader well.There is a believable and unbelievable part in the book. The believable was when the yellow man got hit in the head. The most unbelievable part in the book was when Mr. Tuck shot him self and he didn't die.There is a part in the book that is ""less than perfect."" The part in the book was when Jesse is with Winne a lone. I would always make somebody by them at all time.The book was poor and fair at the same time. The entertainment wasn't all that good. The reason it wasn't to active is because it didn't have any fighting. It would have been better if it had more fighting."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting, by Natalie Babbit, was a very magical book. This story is like a fairy tale with a beginning and no end. I found that this story gives you a different perspective on how you want to live your life. To really understand this book you need to have an open immagination."
2,Tuck Everlasting,"I do believe that it was an ok book, until the ending. I disliked the ending because I believe that Winnie should have found Jesse when she was 17, but not drink the water. She should have lived with him and adventure around with him. Well that is my opinion."
5,Tuck Everlasting,Tuck Everlasting was a good book I loved it. Winnie was brilliant Natalie Babbitt was excellent. I really liked it and recommend it to every one. It's ckinda slow but good.We read it at my school and it was good.The book is good and exciting it is well explaned and moves along slowly.This book is good you should read it.
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Natalie Babbitt&#65533;s Tuck Everlasting is a great book. It uses lots of imagination, and is very suspenseful. I would suggest this book to anyone who has a good imagination. It&#65533;s about a girl, Winnie Foster, who finds a spring in her wood. After being kidnapped, she finds out this spring makes you live forever. Her friend, who has drunk the water, is to be hung. If she is, the secret will be out and the whole world will live forever. Can Winnie save her friend? Will she drink the water?This is an awesome book. I would recommend it to almost everyone. It was very exciting and full of action. It has every thing from a murder to a rescue. This is a 4 star book. You should really consider reading this book."
4,Tuck Everlasting,Tuck Everlasting was a great book. The way Natalie Babbitt describes theTucks is awesome. The Tucks are very calm and quiet people. They probablywould not be the ones you would suspect to be doing weird things. Winnie Fosteris also a favorite. She is a very passionate little girl who is kept from playing withother people outside of her own fence. On a hot day a little girl runs away from home.Then finds out a secret that she is not supposed to know. Then there is a very mysterious man that appears.I think this was a great book. The details are really cool. I would give this book 4 out 5 stars. This was a great book I laughed. I cried. This is my review on TuckEverlasting.
3,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck EverlastingTuck Everlasting takes place in a small countryside place called Treegap. This book has its ups and downs, it's exciting, sad, and happy. In this book there are two families, the Tucks and the Fosters. The Tucks are very special they cannot die, they are everlasting (hint the title). The Fosters are goody two shoes (spoiled) Winnie runs away ending up in the hands of the family the Tucks. This book is a good book because of the drama, suspense, and surprises, things you didn't see coming. I give this book a 3 star rating because I wouldn't say it's my favorite book but it's one I like. I probably wouldn't read it over again because all the surprises you'll already know about, but I think I would watch the movie to see the differences."
3,Good but confusing!,"This story was about two families the Fosters and the Tucks. I was very confused thoughout this book. The Fosters didn't like people on their land because they had a secret water well. If you drank from it, you would live forever.The story took place in the woods mostly.Will Winnie Foster keep the secret that the Tucks drank from her family well?After becoming friends with the youngest Tuck, Winnie Foster never revealed their secret, because she too drank from the well and lived forever.Cody H - 4th grade"
4,tuck everlasting,this was a very good book and was very well writen. this book was fantasy and was fun to read. this book was on my top five of greatest books read.
3,"Wonderful Description, Plot, and Setting","This book was a wonderful story of a family who become immortal. This had magnificent decription, and the setting really came alive in the book."
4,"A Fantastic Story For Some, A Bore For Others.","This was a intresting and perplexing story. And I think it could only be told by the ingenious mind of Nattile Babbit. My 6th grade class read the book for our last project of the year. It took a while to read the first 13 chapters, but we flew by the last chapters. At some points the book was exciting, but some chapters seemed to drag on. I thought there wasn't enough action in the story. The pond chapters were the best in the whole story. The book made you think who was the villian was, The mystrious and evil man in the yellow suit or the cursed water that has tormented the Tucks for 87 years. Unless you allow yourself to be sucked into the vast world of the story, to fell Miles' pain and Winnie's triumph. You won't lighten up to enjoy this touching and exciting story."
5,A good book worth reading again,Tuck Everlasting is a book i read in 5th grade and have read several times since. It asks questions about what people's priorities are and the choices they make in life in a very insightful but subtle way.I would recommend it to readers of all ages.
3,"This book was interesting, but not my favorite.","I read this book in school. It is about a family who is eternal- they can live forever, and no one can kill them. Interesting, this book has your attention. Those of you fifth or sixth grade literature teachers reading this review, here is a book that you might want to consider a long-term assignment, or a good book to read aloud to your class. Katie Brown, age 11 :-)"
5,Tuck Everlasting,"This is the story of Winnie Foster, a lonely only child. She longs to be independent and do something that makes a difference in the world. She wants desperately to run away to show her independence. She chickens out and instead goes to the woods that her family owns. While there she sees a boy leaned up against a tree in a clearing. He takes a drink from a spring in the ground. She introduces herself and asks for a drink. Jesse won't let her. He tells her it would be a terrible mistake. It is then that Mae and Miles Tuck show up and in order to keep her from drinking from the spring they kidnap her! They promise to take her back once they explain things to her and make her understand why she can't take a drink. During her time with them Winnie grows to love the Tucks and does extrodinary things to help save them."
4,Descriptive Book,"The book was very descriptive from the beggining to the end. Especially when the text says, ""And all at once the sun was uncomfortably hot, the dust oppressive, and the meager grass along it's edges somewhat ragged and forlorn."""
4,A review of Tuck Everlasting,This is such a good book. I would recommend this book to a lot of people. It would be so cool to live forever. This book is about the Tucks who own a wood and find a spring and take a sip from it and find out that the spring makes you live forever. Then a stranger comes along and kidnaps Winnie. Then the stranger tries to get the Tucks to sell the wood so he can make moeny selling the spring water. Then Mae hits the stranger with a shotgun and he dies. Then Mae goes to jail and brave Winnie gets her out. This book has a lot of excitement and adventure. This is a very good book.
3,Tuck Everlasting,"I thought this book was a good book.This book is about a girl who finds this boy drinking out of at spring first she wants to drink out of the spring to but they hold her back and take her t their house there she learned tht they were evelasting, Thats were the adventure begins there is a man in a yellow suit following them and they finnaly meet I wont tell you the rest all I can say is read it."
2,A book for people who like fairy tales.......,"Not one of MY favorite books but some people will like it at first the beginning is a bit ssssss lllllllllllll oooooooooo wwwwwwwand they leave you hanging in the end it's a different book to read if you on a bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb boooo rrrrrrrrrrrrr iiiiiiiiiiii nnnnnn ggggggggggg car ride but all in all I recommend it to people who like fairy tales. I don't care if this was your favorite because it certainly wasn't mine. I recommend ""The Series of Unfortunate Events"" or ""Lyddie""."
3,This Book Is OK!,"Tuck Everlasting is a very creative story. To write this story, Natalie Babbit had to use a lot of creativity!I think the best part of the book is when Mae and Winnie switch places in the jail cell!Sam6th Grade"
4,Still Great!,"Read it as a child and loved it, so I had to read it again as an adult and still fully injoyed it"
3,Tuck Everlasting,"The book Tuck Everlasting was a great book. I thought the story was creative how the author had them as if they were blessed or curssed, they didn't know what to think of it, with living forever, and how in the begining winnie meets Jeese in an enchanted clearing in the forest as he is drinking from the hidden spring that contains the water that keeps them alive forever. I also didn't expect the plot to come so late in the book and be like it was. I recomend this book to just about everybody but especialy to people who have a large imagination."
4,What if they made a movie. . .,"Note to the California reviewer: Actually, TUCK was made into a film about 15 years ago. I ordered it about 5 years ago through a local video store, but I was so disappointed. The quality of the film is very poor (or at least my print was) and except for some nice hammer dulcimer music by Malcolm Dawglish for the soundtrack, the movie version is not well done. Let the book play its own movie in your head until you decide to write the screenplay."
2,Not so good,The book just wan't good. The time period was about a three days. The had good points about about living forever but that is it. If I could I would rate it a 2.5 but I can't.
2,boring yet ok,I didn't really like this book it was way to slow. There are a couple of exciting parts but not much. It did keep you reading by hooking you into something big and going slow towards it and you want to keep reading until you find out what happens. If you like books with some adventure and keeps you hooked through the whole thing you will really like this book.
5,Tuck Everlasting,"By now I have read the book and I am going to see the movie.I give it 5 stars. If you haven't read the book yet, I advise you to read it.I have now read other reports and they all said the same thing: it was great,excellent,I loved it,it was pretty good.I advise you to read the book."
3,The Ok Book Tuck Everlasting,"I read the book Tuck Everlasting by Natlie Babbitt. At first I thought this book would be fun to read. When I started readingit,it was so boring. The reason I don't like it is because the girl lied to her parents. In the story some people take her away and changes her live for ever. I recomend this book to ok people."
3,The Never Ending Book,"The book i read was "" Tuck Everlasting "" By Natile Babbit. I would sugjest this book to kids under 10. I rated this book under 10 because it is easeyer for yonger kids to under stand. I rated this book 3 stars because in most parts it did not keep my intrest.This book is about a girl named Winifred who runs away one day and sees a boy drinkind out of the ground. She asks him what he is doing he tells her a secret and runs off. I can't tell you the secret but you can read the book to find out."
2,from [...] point of view,this book was not that interesting and they detaled it to much it got tiering after a while it is worth reading maybe once . but it was most boring beacse i had to read it in school.
3,Tuck Everlasting,"The book Tuck Everlasting was a good book. I think that Winnie was a curious girl. She was not aloud to leave her yard. She met the Tucks, and they had a secret to tell her. They took her to their house.Everyone thought they kidnapped her. The tucks really didn't though. She wanted to go. To find out what happens then read it. It's a good book."
3,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck EverlastingA book review by Tyler TrosperTuck Everlasting is a good book. It&#65533;s a book about a family, the Tucks&#65533;, who drink some water from a spring which makes them, live forever. They live a peaceful life until a young girl named Winnie Foster, finds out the Tuck&#65533;s secret. Now they have to tell Winnie why she shouldn&#65533;t tell. It&#65533;s a great book with a lot of twists and turns.I really enjoyed Tuck Everlasting. It wasn&#65533;t my favorite book, but I enjoyed it. I think Natalie Babbit did a great on Tuck Everlasting. Well, I think she should&#65533;ve given the man in the yellow suit a name. It is a great book."
4,Tuck Everlasting,Tuck EverlastingBy: Natalie BabbittThe story takes place in TreeGap. Winnie is an only child and she is going to run away. At dusk a man in a yellow suit wanted to talk to the Fosters. But the Tucks who live forever and they have looked the same for 87 years. They come home every ten years. When they were coming home Jesse took a drink from the spring and Winnie saw him and she wanted a drink of it and she couldn't because she would live forever. The Tucks kidnapped Winnie and took her to their house. Their horse got stolen.This story was really good. This was my favorite book. The first part of the book was really boring. But it got better after that. Don't stop reading after the middle of the book.
3,Moving cliffhanger,We love this book because it's different than any other book that we read in bookclub. It definently was a great book. We reccomend it to anyone.
5,Wonderful,this book was awesome!!!!! loved it cant put it down she liged !lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
4,Death and Life,"The wonderful and enchanted book Tuck Everlasting has romance, action, and a great mystery behind it. This book teaches the qualities of life and death. The question behind this book, is would you want to live forever? If so, would you think it's a gift or a curse? This wonderful book starts off with 10 year old girl Winnie Foster who lives in a town called Treegap. Winnie Foster meets a mistereous family called the Tucks. The Tucks have an unknown secret that Winnie Foster discovers. Now that Winnie knows the secret, it is even harder for the Tucks to hide. I think Natalie Babbit did a great job writing this book. I would recomend this book to any young reader and even any adult."
2,What's The Secret?,"A young girl named Winnie Foster is walking in the woods when she meets a ""young"" man about 17. she asks him how old he is and he says 104. Winnie is shocked. The boy Jesse explains everything as soon as he makes sure no one is listening. He says that many years ago, his family and his horse drank water from the oak spring causing them to live FOREVER! the dad says they are like rocks, they just are! they never get any older or age at all! everyone would want to have that kind of power, that is why it must be kept secret. To find out if they are kept secret, i think you should checkout the book! i totally reccomend it!"
4,One You Won't Want to Put Down,"I really enjoyed this book and I will probably read it again. It took a couple of chapters to really grab my attention but once it did I could not put it down.This story, which is filled with adventure and suspense, makes you think about what it would be like to live forever. It is about the adventures of a girl named Winnie whose father has the key to eternal life.As you read about Winnie's adventures, you start thinking about whether you would want to live forever. It's really exciting and you're constantly wondering what will happen next.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a story about adventure and suspense."
4,A Tuck Everlasting Reveiw,I thougth Tuck Everlasting was a fairly good book. It had a lot of words that told you what a place looks like. It also explained a lot about how the characters personality was. It had words that made you think of your own picture in your head. When you read the first few pages of the book you will think it is going to be boring but it gets pretty exciting after the first few pages. I would recommend this book to others.
3,Tuck Everlasting,"I thought this book was okay! It was very adventourous and exciting. I really did not understand the book or the point of having a puddle with water that will make you always be young. I mean I do not think I would want to be young forever! I do like Winne who gets into some mischeif and meets an unusal family. Then she finds out who they really are, and when she finds her true love and a chance to stay young forever!"
2,Not my type of book.,"The words were vivid, but that was about the only thing good about this book. The plot was way too boring and overdone. The whole first chapter was describing a road. If the author really wanted us to know what it looked like she should have illustrated it. This book maybe suited for a 10 year old girl, but as for me, I could barely stay awake."
5,"Tuck Everlasting, a wonderful book","Tuck Evelasting is a magical book about a magical experience that a little girl stumbles upon during her ""run away."" The little girl, Winnie, finds an unusual family, the Tucks, who have a secret about life,how long life lasts, and the joys and downfalls of never dying. Winnie has the chance to stay on the earth forever, but will she after she finds out about the Tucks and befriends them? But not every thing is so easy going. There is a man who wants to sell the secret to people. In the long run, what will happen if he does? This book is a one of a kind, enchanting book. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages!"
4,Tuck Everlasting,TUCK EVERLASTINGIf you love adventure and excitement you will love TUCK EVERLASTING it is about a lonely girl that has no fun at all but then she finds the secret water of the tucks that there is water that gave everlasting life and there is a mysterious person that wants the water of the tucks. Then Winnie runs away from her house and she met a boy named Jesse and that is where the adventure and secret of the everlasting Tucks. There are always twist and turns that make this book interesting. The secret water shall never be revealed for the Tucks are in jeopardy.
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck EverlastingTuck Everlasting is definitely an inspiring story. It revolves around a ten-year-old girl named Winnie Foster living in Treegap in 1880 whose life is turned upside-down when she decides to go outside of the gate surrounding her life and into the forest her family owns.There she meets Jesse Tuck, drinking from the very spring that changed him and his family's life. Eighty years before, the Tucks were traveling through Treegap when they stumbled upon the spring in the forest. After they and the horse drank from it, they learned it can grant eternal life.Although Winnie promises to keep this important secret, there is a mysterious stranger threatening the Tucks' secrecy. Will he discover the Tucks' immortality? Will Winnie keep their secret? Can the Tucks really never die? Read Tuck Everlasting and find out."
3,Tuck Everlasting,"I think this book was well-written. I liked the plot and the Theme, but the author could of made it longer and make something happen that was more disasterous. Like maybe Winnie would have taken the water of life and had to find out a way to change her back into a normal, growing child."
4,tuck everlasting reveiws,If you want a good fantasy book to read I recomend this book.I think It was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read and it is very exciting.It is about a girl who doesn't have a very good life so one day she runs deep into her woods and she gets kidnaped but she is glad she got kidnapped because the people who get her are very nice and they have a better life.And they do not want her to tell anybody about the water they drink every ten years.whoever reads this should go get the book and read it it is very good.
4,a great book,this book was [really] good i think the people that dont think this book is good and give it a one or two stars are very [uneducated]. they dont know what a good book is when they read it this book was overall a great book i gave this book a 4 stars because some parts were boring and other parts were very intersting
3,Jonathan Fowler's Review For Miss Jensen's Class,"When I read the book at the first few chapters, I thought it would be about friendship. The more I read the more I understood about the book. The book was about people who are immortal and someone discovers them. They kidnapped a girl and bring her to their home. The girl and the family became friends. Someone else found out about them and tries to get them to help him sell the water that makes you immortal."
4,"Appreciating Mortality, an Instant Classic","An outstanding fantasy book; unexpectedly tickles its readers with the possibility of immortality. The main character stumbles upon a friendly group of people who she eventually finds out are immortal. Dangerously, she is ultimately given the opportunity to join them in living forever. Why this is dangerous or simply not very smart ends up becoming an important lesson this book tries to instill upon its readers.I've enjoyed this tale twice. The first time was in the sixth grade many, many years ago. I dare say that this might've been the first novel of this length that I ever read at that time. I remember it getting me motivated to read more. Teachers, parents...hint, hint!The book is definitely much better than the movie.Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"
3,All Right,"This book was all right and a good read starting at around the middle. I read this book at school in Clermont as a class. The opinions in my class varied from person to person. Most people including I, were creeped out when 104 year old Jesse Tuck was showing off for Winnie Foster and proposed to her. People also said it was a bit more interesting in the end. Most people finished it before time. In conclusion the book was not to bad but all right."
4,The emotional and adventurous movie,I am writing about an emotional dramatic movie called Tuck Everlasting. First off all I Liked the actors and how they acted out their scenes. Like when Miles and Jessie acted in the jail break that was really funny.Secondly I liked how the movie was so emotional especially when Miles tells Winnie about the secret of the spring. This movie is very interesting if I liked it you should.
5,What an intense book,"Tuck Everlasting was a lovely book containing adventure mystery and a little bit of romance I loved how Babbit could focus so much on little things like the toud. The plot of the story makkes me think very hard and it makes me appreciate all of the apects of life including death. It was very interesting how she left out perticular parts of the book, like the name of Winnies gaurdians and especially the man in the yellow suit. the book is a must read for everyone and I think that there should be a sequel because the ending was the only disapointing part(I wanted to have the tucks find a way to die or Winnie could have ran away with Jesse. I really cant understand why people could rate it under a four. Another question I have is Why can you rate only to 5 it should go up to 100 for Tuck Everlasting."
4,"""Tuck Everlasting Book Review""","""Tuck Everlasting"" Is a thrilling, epic, story of ten year old Winnie Foster and her amazing adventures and discoveries. Stepping out of an old rusty gate into a world that you never knew existed, is what you'd imagine when you read the tale.Natalie Babbitt's (The Author's)clear, vivid tale basically has to deal with matters of ""Life and Death"". Evey tiny moment in the story waiting to be revealed will shock you. The author describes everything so perfectly, It's like you're in the story over looking everything.I would recommend Tuck Everlasting to any reader who loves spine chilling events. The last thing I have to say, maybe the most important thing in the book concerning every adjective and simile you can think of, but only described in six, small, simple, words are....What if you could live forever?-Jenna M. Grade 6"
3,A Excellent Book,This is an great story it really explains the true meaning of life to me. You catch a glimse of life from another point of view and that makes it exciting. Sometimes when you feel scared this book can show you that it's just part of your life. Nobody can really explain how life really is but this book does a great job of explaining lifes adventures.
4,Tuck Everlasting,"The idea of living forever isn't new or original. But I just love the way Natalie Babbit portrays it in Tuck Everlasting. Tuck Everlasting is about Winnie Foster, who stumbles upon the Tuck family, blessed/cursed with immortality because of the water they drank. She is not the only one to know their secret--a man wants to sell their secret for profit.I liked this book because of the descriptions and details in the chapters. Natalie Babbit describes scenes beautifully, and I actually feel like I'm in the book with Winnie and the Tuck family. Another thing I appreciate about this book is that although it can be considered fantasy, Tuck Everlasting does not go overboard with fantasy. Winnie's life is normal for her, and the immortality is the only touch of fantasy in her world. The Tucks' immortality is presented with both its good and bad sides, and the question that the book left me to think about was ""Is living forever really better than being mortal?"""
3,Not a Fan of This Book,"I'm a fan of Natalie Babbitt, but not a fan of this book. Mainly I found the theme or ""meaning"" of the story in-your-face, and I didn't enjoy that at all. I thought the setting (1880s) was very well created. In fact, the setting was my favorite part of the story. I realize that's an odd ""favorite,"" but I liked the setting more than the characters and more than the plot. The author's intent -- to make one think about whether one should want to live forever, or what one would do to live forever -- is noteworthy, but the actual story is slow and heavy-handed."
1,TUCK EVERLASTING,"TuckEverlastingBYNatalieBabbittYou should Never read Tuck Everlasting . First of all,it is a super boring book. In this story a frog lives forever,and that's boring cause why should a frog live forever? If you lived forever,wouldn`t that be boring? You would also run out of things to do.In this book a girl named Winnie meets a boy named Jesse .Jesse is a very boring character, because he never does anything funny. If your reading this book and are not bored, when you get to the part where they meet in the woods you will most likely get bored"
1,this book is confusing yo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,wuz up!! Tuck Everlasting has so many twists and turns that I could not figure out what was happening in the book from the beginning.I recomend this book to people who like fariy tales but not to people who like action book.p.s. peace out yo!!!!!!!!!
2,hehe,this book is kinda weird... it confuses me. its about a girl named winnie who gets kidnapped by the tucks because she knew their secret. later theres a man in a yellow suit who knows their secret too and comes to take winnie back for a ransom of getting winnies' parent's woods. Mae (the wife of Angus tuck) kills him by whacking a shotgun on his skull. she gets sentenced to death. read to find out. i dont recommend this book to anyone who gets confused as much as i do
1,"Not That Bad, But...","Overrated. This is a book about having the chance to live forever. Shouldn't there be some soul-searching going on? Babbitt skips right over Winnie's soul searching, and barely touches the Tucks' soul searching. The immortal frog was touching, but was merely sentimental.The business man situation was far too easily resolved. There was just so much more that I wanted from this premise, and I didn't get it. Thankfully it only took me about an hour to read it, so I didn't waste too much time."
4,Nice on your eyes,"I really liked this DVD. It's a given that not every girl there kept my attention - tastes differ (that's why there is the ""next"" button on a remote). But several of them was a pleasure to watch. Do not expect any hard action. But if you like this kind of soft eye-candy I would definitely recommend it. Kay Sivilay, Angelica Pamintuan, Sunisa Kim - Asian beauties at their best... I would like to see more of them."
3,Want to see some SIZZLING Thai chicks?,"OK, so if you guys have read my reviews, you can tell by now that I have a thing for Asian hotties. In ""East Meets West"" you get a collection of girls from all over Asia, and some of them are pretty cute. But, if you want to see a movie shot right on the beaches of Thailand, get my new favorite DVD: ""Wild Girls Thailand"". A couple of American guys handpicked the chicks and the location is awesome."
5,Good shoe for daily use.,I have used it daily for about a year and it's holding up good and very comfortable.
4,"Good shoe, great price","purchased these shoes for under 30.00. at first, i thought they would be a little uncomfortable. most new shoes require a breaking-in period. these shoes did not fit that mold. i wore them to work and they felt more comfortable then the shoes i ditched for them."
2,How do I navigate this book without seeing title of each work WITH the work,I bought this and the Ankele Christmas book. I am thoroughly enjoying the images and thumbprint gallery. Problem is I don't see a title next to each image and I can't figure out how to navigate between title page and image. Is there help? THANKS
3,"Flawed, but not a total loss","While Don Giovanni is not an easy opera to master, the performance on this set does have its ups and downs. Karajan takes a lot of the sparkle from this opera and adds a certain teutonic charm (albeit a sluggish charm). Ramey, Furlannetto, and Battle are really in their elements in these roles, but Baltsa, and Tomowa-Sintow truly do not have what it takes to be Mozart heroines. If you are a fan of Ramey, then this is not a bad choice. If you want a balanced set, then don't even bother."
4,A Coloured Don Giovanni version,"I don't understand why this recording doesn`t appear inthe Don Giovanni rating between the first twelve. I believe i found the reasons, but i don't think of a better Don Giovanni than Ramey (I listened by ex. to Shimell, Wachter or Fischer Dieskau and i still prefer Ramey, a orchestration than the Karajan's one, a better Leporello (except the same Ramey in the 1990 Muti version, but he is not too comic), and etc. The only reason i found, repeat, is perhaps the A. Baltsa's Elvira, who doesnt reach the excellency of Schwarzkopf or Vaness or Winbergh who isn't too convincent as a Dermota, Araiza or Lopardo. But is the more coloured and better performed (as actors) i ever heard, for this reason, i recommend you to buy the video version with the same cast (except Baltsa) and buy the Giulini 1959 version in CD, which is the best recording, after the most distinguished critics."
4,My second Choice recording,"This excellent Don Giovanni,good as it is has it's falts. Karajan seems a little wooden in his conducting, despite years of expirience and a great orchestra. even so, he gives a servicaable reading of the work. Ramey is a great Don, with only one notable flaw: his scream as he is dragged off to hell. Luckily those are the records only two major falts."
1,One of the worst studio recordings of the piece,"This is Karajan at his worst : out of contact with the style and with the music, with a absurd cast (some of it looks interesting on paper, but none of the participants is even close to his/her best). A heavy, clumsy reading, even more clumsily edited (a lot of little mistakes and imperfections due to haste, as bad as in Karajan's Magic Flute). Karajan has at least two great 'live' Giovannis in his output (the 1960 Vienna with Leontyne Price, and the 1968 Salzburg with Ghiaurov and Talvela). This one's for nothing."
5,great masterpiece,"I don't understand the review done by Amazon (I doubt if he/she ever listened this work). Without doubt, this Don Giovanni is full of power as well as beauty. I have listened almost all Don Giovanni currently available in market and convinced myself this is the best one. Unless you are the particular fan of some conductor or hating Karajan because of his name value, you should try this. You will see the perfect combination of the Classis and the Romanticism from this work."
1,seems to be dead after 1 use and 6 months of storage,"bought, used, worked ok, stored in garage for a while I need it again today wont even get hot enough to cut warm butter 0__o ive gone thru a whole bunch of the cheap ones make sure you buy a nicer iron"
1,don't waste your money,I used this product twice and stored it for about 2 months. Then i had a small wire to solderand it would not heat up enough to slice thru butter. Total garbage. i paid too much money for this junk
1,Junk,"I had the same problem with my Weller 7200 as the previous reviewers. It worked for a short time and now won't heat up, even with new tips. I wonder what foreign country it's made in? The reviews on the 8200 seem much better."
1,Same here - dead after a couple of uses,I had mine for a year. Used it twice. Went back to use it a 3rd time after a year... completely dead. How can a product survive after so many dead products on the market?
1,Useless,This iron won't even heat up enough to melt solder. You can literally put your hand around it and use it as a hand warmer. Cheap.
1,Weller Junk,I found this piece of equipment to be a piece of junk. I think it worked ok for me once and now will not heat up to a temp to even melt the solder. Try another brand.
2,Mediocre celtic music,I've heard John Whelan's music before and liked it very much.....this CD kind of disappoints you......too many songs sound the same....there is no variety in his style this time....or change up of the rhythms he uses....
5,Captivating Exploration,"John Whelan and his fellow musicians have achieved a beautiful collaboration on this recording. This is music that feels and sounds unconstrained by, yet rooted firmly in, tradition. The diverse musical cultures and instruments represented here (Irish button accordion, Flamenco guitar, African djembe and thumb piano) synergize to create a captivating listening experience that goes beyond the boundaries of traditional Irish music, while remaining true to its heart. Across the shifting moods and tempos of these tunes, Whelan and his friends sound as if they are inspired to be playing this music, putting a lot of heart- not just serious chops -into it. An all-around excellent set, for sure."
5,A gem...,"This is clearly another brilliant and daring exploration of what is bleak and beautiful among us. Rarely do lyrics, production and vocals coincide with such grace and power. Patty Griffin has done her Blood on the Tracks with this and maybe even moves us forward from Dylan's masterpiece as well. As with many great albums, Children Running Through exceeds the sum of its parts and reminds us it is possible for a soul to cut through all that is poised to dilute, re-direct, re-package it and triumphantly move others with its labors. Patty Griffin has once again brought us to the campfire of human experience. This album offers up our commonality in a way that makes one a better person for the accepting. Goddamn great record."
5,SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT,"I have only recently discovered Patty Griffin but what a magnificent discovery it has been. I was fortunate enough to be at her concert in Melbourne last week and can only say that I was moved to tears. Many of the songs from this album featured in the concert. Now I have most of her albums and her DVD and have started to immerse myself. At this stage, I find I just love this album particularly - the diversity of song styles, the poetic and heartfelt lyrics and wonderful vocal delivery leave me breathless."
5,Patti album,I love Patti Griffin. This is a fun album with sometimes odd lyrics. Her voice is great.
5,My Best Friend,"I wish I could square the 5 star rating. I was familiar with Patty Griffin's songs long before I heard her beautiful voice. She is a marvel. I normally need to warm up to new music before I start to enjoy it. This lovely collection was my current favorite the first time I heard it. Heavenly Day is now my ""happy place"" when I need one. I'd give Patty a hug if I could reach far enough. Thanks for the good times!"
5,Just in time for the summer driving season,"I do a lot of driving for my job. Let me paint a picture for you. It is 80+ degrees, it is Ohio so it is muggy, and I am in my zoomy little Toyota Corolla (Silver), on a state route in the middle of no where because I am too fussy for the highway these days, eyes open for antique stores and junk shops, window cranked down (that's right, no power windows) and this CD is cranked up. This CD with it's down and dirty blues inspired songs, playful and sassy alt-country songs, and soulful simple folk songs.And of course there is rocking out.Even if you hate music, even if you are curmudgeonly and grumpy, buy this CD anyway, just for the song Heavenly Day. It will melt your fool heart. Patty Griffin said in concert that she wrote this track for her dog and that's just fine by me."
5,Amazing musical variety and lyrics,"This is my first Patty Griffin CD, but it won't be my last. When friends hear it they immediately ask, ""Who is this? She's incredible."" Patty Griffin draws us in with her magical stories, haunting personas and melodic voice."
3,not my preferred music genre,"i wasnt sure what to expect hwne i purchased this album, but i wasnt very impressed, the music and lyrics seemed somewhat immature, more country western than i usually like, and the sound in most of the songs was the same , not a great variety of musical talent"
1,Too Bad There Isn't A Zero Star Rating,"You really have to wonder how some of these people get their work published, or recorded. Basic, boring country overlaid with a thin veil of singer-songwriter angst. Nothing to recommend it musically (none at all), and precious little lyrically. And unfortunately, there isn't even a great or even all that good singer to deliver the pap. If this is what they call alternative country, then Nashville isn't looking quite so heinous. Nah...Nashville's still the worst America has to offer."
2,Disappointing - stop the warbling!,"I have been a Patty Griffin fan for a few years now. I LOVE her slow, lyrical ballads... her voice is just beautiful. BUT... when she picks up the pace and starts with the guitar banging and endless warbling, I just stop listening and skip to the next track. Unfortunately, with her last 2 CDs, I find myself skipping more tracks than I listen to."
2,Critically over rated,"I was disappointed in this album after the local press that it had received. It was getting featured play locally on one of the University stations. I had bought the ""Red "" Album some time back and loved it. I'm not sure what genre she's working on here... Country? Rockabilly?There just doesn't seem to be a flow to the music selection"
2,Beautiful artwork outside....,"I've long been a Patty afficionado....from Ghosts to Impossible Dream, but this isn't up to her usual flair for words nor melody writing. Trapeze is the best song on this CD. The other songs music and lyrics aren't as intersting, nor as connected as with her previous works. Although this CD is good, the edge just isn't as sharp. This is a small bump in her road..."
3,Disappointed,"More layered, produced, but ultimately thinner with less to say. Prefer PG to Bonnie Rait and this, at times, sounds more like the latter. Bar's been set awfully high and this time PG reaches, falls, reaches, falls - a cd with standout tracks that, compared with her others, doesn't stand out."
4,Patty Griffin Children Running Through,This is an easy listening cd. I listened 3 times til it grew on me.Nice addition to her work.
5,An eclectric mix of really good music,I am new to Patty Griffin. I have heard bits and pieces of her other four or so albums but this is the first I have bought. I must say that I was really impressed by this CD. It has a range of genres that captivate you from start to finish and Patty's vocal talent is as strong as ever. I find no flaws in this CD to give it any less than 5 stars.
5,Brilliant,"this one is definitely a grower, give it a few spins and you wont regret it, no one writes and sings like patty griffin today, right up there with dylan and lucinda williams.....after a week, i have decided to add to this review and say that this could be the greatest record released in modern times, possibly surpassing blood on the tracks, and at least equal to blue and car wheels.....every track leaves me breathless when its over, in fact i find it hard to have this on shuffle on my ipod because anything else that comes after sounds lacking"
1,Did Not Like,I found this product not to help in any way. Also the smell was strong & lasted to long. I would not reccoment this product & threw away $48.
2,Disappointing,"The concept of the Long Boom is an important one, but this book does not do it justice. The authors attempt to make their point by combining three disparate text threads into one theme, but this combination of non-fiction and parable comes off more like dueling banjos. The first thread is a fairly shallow narrative recounting the familiar causes to which most now attribute our current prosperity - network effects, globalization, info technology etc. The second thread follows a fictional American yuppie's life through his annual Christmas letters to several buddies. This recounts his journey from sensitive college grad to Big Chill Volvo owner. The third text is a ""transcript"" from a fictional news show from 2050 that identifies the Open Source Movement, the downfall of Microsoft and similar developments shortly after the turn of the Millennium as the key turning points that make possible the ensuing 50 year long boom.This book could have been so much better."
2,"An easy read, very upbeat but","The different technology's explored in The Long Boom that will begin to mature as we move into the 21st century are very interesting and, I believe, essentially correct. The biggest shortcoming of the book is the author's constant reference to solving global warming, A PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST. Time and again the author's reference this topic and it distracts from the upbeat, visionary, look into the future."
5,Fantastic Book Offers Optimism and Global Understanding,"The Long Boom is a primer for the 21st century. It provides in-depth overviews of critical emerging technologies and trends, familiarizing the reader with promising developments coming in the future. Furthermore, it espouses a plan of action based on optimism, globalism, and growth. And the optimism is not empty. Rather, optimism about the Long Boom is based on a series of careful arguments about emerging technologies and global cultures. In short, the Long Boom uncovers the strength of global cultures and the positive impact of future technologies. According to Schwartz and Leyden, however, the Long Boom won't just happen, but rather will depend upon our contributions. This normative scenario will require that we all join together to promote openness, globalism, and progress. If you're going to read one book before the new millenium, you should read this one. Because it really matters, and requires us to make it happen."
3,An optimistic view,"I read Peter Schwartz book on the ""The Art of the Long View"". I was expecting sometime like that.What he suggested was to take two of the most important variables and make four world models from them. If so what we have here is the optimistic scenario.Most futuristic models in my experience fail as they attempt to make a long term model on previous short term results. As it was written in 2000 just after the fall of communism in Russia and the Asian meltdown and before 911, it exaggerates the melt down in Asia and ignores the military totally.In this scenario we have only globalism and progress."
1,Buyer beware,"These staples arrived two weeks afer placing the order. All of the staples were smashed, perhaps due to inadequate padding in the shipment. Essentially, the product was unusable when it arived. I would not recommend purchasing this product online from this supplier."

1,Is This Comedy????,"Wow, I had such high expectations for this DVD yet it turned out to be a major letdown! It comes with two DVD's. Many of the better known comedians are included in it.I was looking for a bunch of mini stand up comedy acts. But what it turns out to be is a bunch of mini-round table discussions with each discussion having four comedians. Byron Allen asks a question to someone ""when did you first get into comedy"" and the person answers then someone else jumps in with a funny reply, and so on.So as I was looking more for single comedy acts. This DVD is more like round table discussions. Some people may be looking for this, and if you are, then this DVD is for you.Oh, and one last thing, the Byron Allen laugh and giggle.....I think that is really, really annoying."
1,pass,"when i ordered this product, i suppose that i'd hoped for a steady line-up of comics emitting their greatest material. i was disappointed. two dvds held about 10 episodes of the show. in each, byron comes on for a few minutes and offers maybe a dozen jokes. then, he sits with 4 comics who talk about their lives and shows they'll be in in the near future. occasionally, a comic provides a 3 minute skit. there was as much music and introduction and pauses for ""commercials"" (not shown here) and the ending as there was anything funny. overall, i think that probably half of the comedians were somewhat funny. given that the comedy channel is freely available to most people today, i think that i would recommend it over the purchase of this tape. if you don't receive a comedy channel or you're a fan of byron's, then the purchase of this product, used, might be a laugh..."
3,Comics a weaken effort,"I love good comedy. I love comedians.However Comics Unleashed is a weak effort, Four comics and Byron Allen get together panel style and throw out one liners. I would love each to have a mini stand up. With four comics together most get to say a few things to say, but one or two get the brunt of the spotlight.These shows have intros like after these messages rather than editing these to just the show. It also seems to date itself.On the positive side, Byron Allen does a nice mini standup at the beginning of the showIt is not a great show to put on DVDBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,"Unleased! Well, kind of....ok not really....","Byron Allen. I'll be honest, I had never really heard of him till I got this dvd. And as a comedian I will say he has a couple really funny jokes. And the idea is solid as well, get a bunch of comics together and let them have a round table discussion. Good idea, but unfortunately bad execution.The comedians are funny, but unleased is a wrong word for it. You can tell the show is carefully (and considering some of the comics they have on there ie Dane Cook for one!) edited. The comics all use very PG language and keep their jokes tame.Also the discussion never breaks out into anything even remotely non politically correct. They talk about Bush once. But in general every episode talks about plastic surgery and dating.The show has an excellent premise. But unfortunally it should have been called Comics Leashed....."
3,OK but nothing more,"LIke most others, I have never heard of this show, and it isn't a show of stand up comics. Instead, it's a talk show panel style with 4 comics just shooting the breeze with whatever topics they decide to ramble on about. Some of the shows are a little funny, but more often than not, I found myself paying less and less attention. I can't knock it for what it is, but most of the episodes weren't that funny.I think it might be ok, if watched in spurts of 1-2 episodes, as it's not a stream of comics doing stand up, but as mentioned, comics just chatting. The first episode with Dane Cook was entertaining but the episodes seem to spiral down from there. John Lovitz was a nice surprise, but nothing really happened that was really funny either. Nice idea, but it's not for me."
3,Meh...,"You've got to give it to Byron Allen: with virtually no talent, he's built a business and a name for himself in a city where most people try and fail. This DVD is an example of one of his endeavors and although it's not terrible (he does have some pretty strong talent as guests) it's hard to recommend it. Some bits done by people like Brad Garrett and Cedric the Entertainer are pretty hilarious. One recommendation if you do buy this: keep the clicker handy; you're going to need to do a lot of fast-forwarding when Allen is talking."
4,Very funny,I am a huge fan of stand up comedy and this DVD delivered. I found it very entertaining and funny. Great gift for anyone who enjoys stand up comedy. Great selection of comedians. Great DVD.
2,"Misleading description, and not that funny.","Sure, this DVD features a lot of comedians. However, the DVD description reads as if the comedians are performing. They are not.This is a talk show hosted by D-list celeb host Byron Alen. It features a panel of comedians delivering obviously pre-written lines about uninteresting topics of discussion.I would love to have seen clips of standup from the likes of Howie Mandell and the rest - but alas, it's not here. This is just clips of a (I assume) syndicated late night talk show you're likely to see on basic cable when you have insomnia and don't want to watch another infomercial for Kevin Trudeau's ""Secrets of Ripping-Off Consumers They Don't want You to Know About."""
1,Rupert Pupkin and his hostages,"I love comedy and thought this was maybe an anthology of current comedy acts. Wow, I could not have been more wrong. This seems like a failed pilot or a vanity project for Byron Allen. It is horrible on almost every level. The production values are worse than my 1970's high school AV squad. The ""guest"" comedians look vaguely embarrassed to be on. A couple of them even ask ""Is this going to be on TV?"".... ""What channel will this be on?"".The only way I could even get through this 2 disc set (I watched the entire thing) was to pretend this was a version of ""The King Of Comedy"" and that Byron Allen was a black Rupert Pupkin and the comedians were his hostages. It didn't make it any better but it did occupy my mind for the 176 minutes. I looked in vain for the ""featurette"" but could not find it. I confess I didn't look that hard.Please save your money. Or buy ""The King of Comedy""."
1,Don't give Dogs a Bad Name!,"If this is ""the best of comics unleashed,"" then they should have kept them on the leash, or at least tried to clean up their messes. I like dogs, but this could give dogs a bad name.Seriously, this is an example of why most comedy shows are carefully-written and carefully-scripted. They may have been hoping for spontaneity, but the ugly little secret is that good comedians don't just ad lib. They have carefully planned ""routines."" Yes, there are a few like Robin Williams who appears to ad lib, but in most cases it is material he has carefully thought through, and filed away for an opportunity to use it ""on the spot"" as an apparent ad lib.These comedians are mostly nice people--good when their material has been written and practiced. It must have been as embarrassing for them to see this video as it would be for us to have paid for it. Keep these dogs out of your house."
1,I thought it was supposed to be a COMEDY!,"When I ordered The Best of Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen, I thought I was getting a great comedy DVD - boy was I mistaken! This appears as if an amateur recorded it - with the terrible editing job. Granted, the commercials are gone - but it was painful to think that someone was selling this for money!There was a great list of comedians included, Cedric the Entertainer, Howie Mandel, George Wallace, Brad Garrett, etc. I was excited to load it in the DVD player!! Then, as I realized it wasn't going to get any better, I found myself cleaning house waiting for it to end. (I have 2 young kids - cleaning house is not a fun task for me at all - so for me to WANT to clean vs. watch this says a lot!!)If you are a big Byron Allen fan ... go for it. Everyone else - pass this one up!- 1smileycat :-)"
1,We Are Not Amused,"How can such a funny bunch of folks turn out to be so UN-FUNNY? Watch this DVD, and you'll see how it happens.First, line up a great cast of comics, including Jon Lovitz, Howie Mandel, David Brenner, Margaret Cho. Next, invite them to a ""talk-show-format"" show, and feed them stilted, stale one-liners. They respond with the same.Second, add in a live audience that is as stiff as the comics, reacting to the ""hilarious"" jokes as if they (the audience) were a canned laugh track.Third, allow just a minute or two between segments, before blacking out to commercial (no commercials on the DVD, just the blackouts).B-O-R-I-N-G! Seriously folks, as they say, you won't miss a thing by passing this up, except perhaps a few yawns."
1,not even slightly funny,"There are some good people involved with this project so I expected it to be good. Was I ever wrong.This is the most painfully lame program of ""comedy"" I have ever seen. It is not funny. Lame..lame...lame. Everything about it. I cannot think of even one good aspect. A total waste. Straight to DVD."
2,If this is the best I would hate to see the worst,"This DVD is billed as the 'Best' of Comics Unleashed. First off, the description of this is a little off. If you are looking at this in the hopes of seeing stand-up routines by the comics listed look some where else. This is more like a sit-down group where there are a few funny moments.In terms of new material I was really disappointed that not much seemed new. In fact much of it has been repeated time and time again and has, for the most part, lost its luster of being funny.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy comedy and enjoy stand-up comedy. But the ratio of funny stuff to mind numbingly boring stuff is skewed more towards the boring. For a rental this may be ok. But, I don't think I can recommend purchasing it."
3,"Slow at times, but fun!","Got this as a birthday present for a friend who enjoys comedy routines (as do I for that matter).Slow at times, but very funny overall. 3 and a half stars."
3,Stand up alone would have been better,"As others have pointed out, I too thought this would feature stand up comedy, not 4 comics conversing with each other as the host throws out topics for discussion. Sure, every now and then some funny comments are made but, for the most part, I'd say it's a miss. I'd rather have a comedian doing his/her own 30 minute or hour special where they've prepared stories/jokes/rants or what have you instead of having to ad lib (which at times can work quite well, but here it seems too forced). There are talented comedians here but their talent is just not being used as most of us are used to seeing it. My advice would be to skip this and move on."
2,A Lot of Setup With No Payoff,"I didn't know that this show existed until I saw the DVD. After watching the first few episodes, I thought maybe it never made it to air and went straight to DVD. But it looks like it actually aired on Comedy Central. The guests sit around with Byron Allen and he throws out a topic and they each say a little something. Not a bad premise, but it just doesn't work. There are a ton of breaks for commercials and no one ever really gets going. ""Unleashed"" really doesn't fit at all. No one knows when to talk. They all seem a little uncomfortable and then relieved when the episode is done.Bottom Line: This isn't all that funny. It was a chore to get through the entire two disc set."
4,Good eyepiece for the price,"This eyepiece is good for wide field, initial looks at messier objects and star parties. Views are decent in my 8"" f7 Discovery dobsonian but in my Stellarvue nighthawk7, the design flaws really come out. That being said, I paid 40 for this eyepiece, so I am not expecting it to hang with my Pentaxes, but it does help keep them out of my scope at star parties."
5,Quality Wrench,Purchased as a gift for son who needed a large wrench for his tool set. Item shipped on time and is of good quality.
5,1999 Yamaha Kodiak 400,These are great lookin hand guards for my atv. I have a 1999 Yamaha kodiak 400 4x4 and they look great on it. They block the wind and brush when trail riding. A must have in Ohio in the winter. The picture shows green and yellow but they are black molded to your 4 wheeler. Fit was perfect. The only thing I would like to have had better was the instructions. They arnt bad but they are hand drawn and need to be better. Thanks and happy trailing
3,What's the purpose of a re-recording?,"The majority of these songs sound very similar to the originals or have been produced in a manner so that they do not sound as good as the originals. Although the sound quality has improved on this CD for their older work, the songs lack the impact and originality of the originals. I just don't particularly like the production of this new album although I still love the songs. I definitely recommend purchasing select songs (the new ones) instead of the entire album."
2,SUCH a bad idea,"I'm going to try to keep this short, there's not much to really say about this CD. Unwritten Law has been on approximately 500 million labels through the years. Thus a true ""greatest hits"" is nearly impossible. So what we're left with is new recordings of songs that are almost 15 years old in some cases. I have heard CPK many, many times in my life, I've seen them perform it live many, many times in my life, but even Scott Russo, completely drunk on stage, is still better than this version. All of these new versions have lost their edge (seriously, what is with the ""ooh oohs"" in CPK?). Maybe I'm just old, and seeing these kinds of CDs makes me remember how much I once enjoyed a band, but at the same time, makes me remember why I gave up on their music in the first place. Enjoy the CD, but please listen to the originals to see how they were meant to be."
2,THE POTTERS' PALETTE,A GRUPE OF FRIENDS WE DISCUSS THIS BOOK AND WE WERE AGREE: WE DID NOT LIKED. WE HAVE IT IN SPANISH.
1,Useless Pretty Book,"I had to return this book because it is so poorly done. Many of the example glaze tiles didn't even tell whether they were fired in oxidation or reduction. It was so frustrating to see a glaze I wanted to use, but have no idea how to make it . Poorly organized. Nice color pictures, though."
4,Seeing IS believing,"Caroline's workbook was incredibly enlightening and helped me to gain clarity not only on my life goals but the values that drive my life. When the principles she suggests are applied -- they are manifested in your life in short order.Caroline's insight, wisdom and depth of experience as a coach are readily apparent in this work. It has been catalyst to deepen my current life journey towards authenticity."
4,Great Recording,"A very good recording of Bernstein's greatest work. Te Kanawa's glorious lyric soprano voice fits perfectly, and her accent imitation and diction are both perfect.Carreras' obviously struggles with the diction, and his voice is not totally right for the part. However, he still sings his parts reasonably well, and does blend nicely with Kiri Te Kanawa. Tatiana Troyanos sounds pretty terrible. She slurs and slides her way around, and sounds generally half out of whack with the rest of the cast. The entire ensemble, however, do a great job and fit in well. All round, it's a good, value for your money CD."
4,Check It out if You are a Fan,"I really enjoyed this book, for the longest time I have wondered about George Lucas and the kind of man he is. This book reveals where his inspirations come from. I especially enjoyed the section on the screening of American Grafiti where Francis Ford Coppla and the producer got in a shouting match. It also has an interesting prview of sorts for the Prequels as this was written long before Phantom Menace was released."
3,"Errors, errors, everywhere..","Although a great read - filled with factual errors!Matmata is the Tunisan town where Luke's crater home is located- Not Matama. The Homestead dwelling is NOT 30 miles from Nefta-more like 5. The book presents a nice photo of a jerba..whatever that is?!- Dewback is the correct word. Djerba is a real location NOT a creature. Ben Kenobi does NOT reside in a cave! ..And all these errors are appearing in only ONE of the Chapters, so accuracy is not an issue with Mr. Pollack.D Slattery"
5,"Buy this, you must","I first bought this book in 1983 and have read it hundreds of times. I was initially disappointed in the 1990 ""update"" (which contained only a new Foreword) but that changed with the newest version of this book. It's too bad George Lucas dismisses it as being ""as accurate as the National Enquirer"" because for someone who hung out on the set of ""Return of the Jedi"" and conducted interviews with Lucas himself, Pollock delivers a highly interesting account of Lucas' life."
4,I love this book!,"I found this book to be incredibly interesting. I love biographies, but some are much more compelling than others. This one really kept my interest. I think one of the best things about it is that it starts with Lucas's roots, and that gives a much better idea to the reader of why things have happened the way they have. I was also impressed by the inclusion of substantial information on Graffiti, which is sometimes ignored, even though it was great, and an important part of Lucas's development as a filmmaker.I have really enjoyed watching both Graffiti and the Star Wars trilogy since I first read this book, because now I see things that I didn't before, and I notice cuts and editing and story points that didn't seem as significant until I read the book. I think it is great."
5,The House of Elliot,"""The House of Elliot"" is one of the best series I have. The story is in the 20's-30's with all the problems of women getting started in business, with women not being trained for jobs. I loved the acting, the story lines, the settings and the connection of family. I have purchased 3 of these ""complete collections"" for family and friends. I would purchase this collection again in a second. I will watch it over several times I am sure.vjDurkee"
3,Great content apalling packaging,"I'm familiar with the series and it is one of those impeccable BBC productions. Great scriptwriting, historical detail and fashio to die for. But I had an enourmous problem getting the discs out of the brittle packaging. Two of the plastic casings cracked as both my husband and I tried various ways of removing the disc from pushing the button in the middle to gentle gripping it on the sides where there are indentations.Is there something about US disc casing that I'm missing? the set has now devalued due to the damage."
3,It's ok!,"This was a very interesting series, but because it was a series it doesn't have an ending. For the story you do get, the wardrobes were the best part. The sisters alway over reacted to things, but that is how they were told to act. The youngest sister was always choosing the wrong men. She was good at dress design and bad in love. I wouldn't waste my time watching it again."
5,House of Elliott,"The series was most interesting, captivating, and the characters likeable. My only negative concerning the series was the ending left you to believe there was more story coming forth...and there is not......"
4,Order cancelled,"Through nobody's fault, the DVDs purchased at Amazon were shipped to the purchaser but never reached the purchaser. Apparently there was some reason why the post office found it impossible to deliver the package and it was immediately returned to the sender. It is a mystery as to why there was some problem with getting the package delivered; the recipient was never informed that the package had even arrived in Baton Rouge. Since the post office returned the mailing to the sender, the order had to be cancelled. The purchaser will receive full credit for the DVDs in question."
1,Socialism in Britian,"If you are a socialist, communist or Fabianist then you will love this series. I did not. This reminds me of the reasons I don't watch Hollywood's productions because they always have to promote their socialist propaganda. And so it is with The House of Eliott."
4,Just picked these up....,"I did just pick these up so I don't have a worthwhile opinion yet...I'm posting this just to let you know what the cut is on these since I wasn't able to find it online. Since these are Swiss Pattern files, the cut is #2 on a scale of 00,0,1,2,3,4,5,6. With #00 being very coarse, #0 coarse, #2 considered fine and #6 super fine.Initial thoughts are that this hobby set aren't as nicely manufactured as my Nicholson X.F. needle files. The Round file is more blunt and thicker as is the Square on the hobby set. Based on the other reviews, I'm hoping they will last a good long while as they are fine cut and I will just be using them for finish filing and not doing any serious removal of material."
2,Bummer,"I couldn`t understand how domestic files could be so inexpensive. It`s because they aren`t domestic- they`re Chinese. Hopefully the quality ispection is good, but I`m not holding my breath. If they wear out post haste, I guess it`s back to Grobet."
4,4 stars for now...,"Bought these considering Nicholson a quality American made product - Received them and they are made in China. As I will be using these professionally, we'll see how they hold up. Can't give them a bad rating just made in China alone, but if quality falters - I will adjust accordingly!"
3,Pretty Good Quality Tools,"I was looking for a set of needle files with quality somewhere in between very expensive U.S.-made Swiss-pattern files and Chinese junk. This set fits in there, I guess. These are pretty good quality. They may be among the better Chinese needle files I've seen, but they're still just that - Chinese needle files. As such, they're way overpriced. You're probably better off saving up for a set of really nice files or just looking around for a set of cheaper Chinese files of acceptable quality. Additionally, the storage pouch which came with the files bears no resembance to the pouch pictured here, and is absolute junk."
2,Poor quality,"I was disappointed in this product. The construction was cheap and fragile, and it did not diffuse air. It produced only two bubble streams, one at each end of the rod, rather than a wall of bubbles as indicated in the advert. Maybe mine was defective, but I returned it an used a regular air stone instead. It did come with two decent suction cups and an adapter for either straight tubing connection, or ""L"" connection from vertical to horizontal. That was a nice touch - but meaningless if the air stone did not do a good (or even decent) job!"
1,Cheap tie rack falls apart,"Don't buy this tie rack for three reasons: its construction is shoddy, it doesn't spin and it's too bulky so it's cumbersome to use. I bought this tie rack two years ago and it fell apart the other day. Even when it worked it, it was annoying because all the ties fell off it when I tipped it slightly while lifting it out of the closet. Plus, the tie rack is inconvenient because it is not designed to spin (technically it does spin because the metal hook at the top isn't securely lodged in the wood peg below it, but it's not meant to spin)."
3,Tie rack,The first one I got was broken - I called and the company sent a replacement. It may not be very sturdy.
3,Interesting look at suffering's transformative power,"In ""The Gifts of Suffering,"" Jungian psychologist Polly Young-Eisendrath discusses the impact of suffering on both the child and adult psyche, with a special emphasis on resilience and transcending pain to find a deeper meaning.While the concept was very illuminating and interesting, the book suffers from a lack of focus. Part social criticism, part inspirational, part Buddhist history and theory, and part psychological theory, the book never seemed to quite come together. I wanted to hear more about how to develop resilience, what cultivates it. I also felt that Dr. Young-Eisendrath could have expanded the parameters of her research to include more than four individuals, interesting though those were, and perhaps made her language a bit more universal, and watered down some of her more critical opinions, which, in my opinion, detracted from the overall effect of her book."
4,"A great recording, not the best","This is a wonderful recording of Beethoven's only, and GREAT opera. The Vienna Philharmonic shines under Bersteins batton. Janowitz is very nice, as is Popp.However, the definitive Fidelio recording is the EMI/Klemperer set.Christa Ludwig blows any other Leonore away. She sings perfectly with wonderful form and emotion. Berry is a chilling Villan, and Vickers and Frick round out this stellar cast. Klemperer's direction is stunning and the Philharmonia plays with power, grace, and elegance.To miss the Klemperer set is to miss one of the most special opera recordings, by the SECOND greatest composer to ever live. Mozart was the greatest composer to ever live."
2,Lots of Physics...No Philosophy,"This work reads more like a general overview of the history of ideas regarding the physical universe rather than a philosophical treatment of the ideas behind physics. The book merely presents in a linear fashion the major ideas that revolutionized our views of the physical world but goes no further than presenting the theories as matter of fact. There are no discussions into the interplay between the philosophy of ideas and the actual modeling of the physical world using the scientific method. It reads similar to Stephen Hawking's ""On The Shoulders of Giants""(a much more interesting work)."
3,"This is NOT a toy, It's a tip for a solder gun",This works as I expected it to. These tips get VERY hot and tend to fail after use for awhile need replacing.
3,solder tip,"Arrived in 2 days and are the tips i have been looking for.These tips are hard to find, most big box stores carry the small tips.These tips are for the 8200n Weller solder guns.My Weller gun is about 25 years old and is big and sturdy. Not like the crap they make today. Kevin S north Jersey."
1,Standard Tip w/Hex Nut (NOT a Toy),"Worked excellent as a spare part for my Weller. I don't understand the review questions about ""The Toy""... ITS a Standard Tip w/Hex Nut spare part, come on... My review is based on the product, not the ""TOY"" usage..., because if used as a ""toy"" its a complete brain damage...Thats why:Usage: 5 stars || Durable: 4 stars || Overall: 5 stars"
2,Disappointing,"I would venture a guess that the majority of people who would be interested in this book are people looking to retire to Mexico and they are looking for the real life experiences of someone who has done it. While Charlie Montemayor did move to Mexico this book is filled with silly stories, trivia and digressions that often became quite frustrating and tiresome to wade through. They are a compilation of letters sent to friends and relatives living back in the US and it reminds me of those shallow Christmas letters we receive summing up the writer's experiences for the year with cute little attempts at humor. Some interesting insights but very little concrete information....and a good editor should have told him to leave out the lame, liberal political humor. On Mexican Time did a much better job telling, in a personal way, one couples adventure in moving to Mexico."
4,A perspective of one who is there...,"Everyone must realize that not all authors will take the same slant on how to write their memoir book. And that is what Charlie's book is--a memoir of his experiences in Guanajuato--also my adopted Mexican town. Buy his book and get a taste of his perspective of his expat experience.Doug BowerAuthor, THE PLAIN TRUTH ABOUT LIVING IN MEXICO"
5,HEART TO HORSE - THE GIFT OF LOVE,"THIS WAS AN OUTSTANDING FAMILY FILM. THE VALUES OF FAMILY LIFE, TRIUMPH OVER ADVERSITY AND THE BONDING EXPERIENCE BETWEEN HORSE AND RIDER WERE BROUGHT INTO SHARP FOCUS. THIS IS A MOVIE THAT MAKES THE HEART GLAD AND THE SPIRIT SOAR. THE SCENERY, THE RIDING ADVENTURE AND INDEED THE ACTING WERE ALL WAY ABOVE LEVEL. AS A CLERGYMAN I HAVE INDEED ENCOUNTERED THE PAIN AND ANGST BROUGHT ON BY THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE. THIS FILM BRINGS HOPE AND THE GRACE OF HEALING AT EVERY TURN. MY SERMON FOR THE DAY: ""CLOSE TO NATURE CLOSE TO GOD."""
1,Kudos MGM...,Thanks so much for giving us a pan and scan of this film. You just lost a customer. What is it with American media corporations and abridgments? What is it with Americans and pan and scanned versions of films?
3,Not Bad,This book is a good explanation of political battle without the electorate being involved. It reveals some of the more tragic but interesting and lesser known political methods in use today. It is informative but not uplifting.
5,Politics by Other Means,"This book is very provocative, insightful, and even rather disheartening. It does a great job breaking down the ways that political parties and the branches of the American government function and interact. The authors make a very bold claim that America has descended into a state of ""pseudo-"" or ""semi-democracy,"" and they substantiate this claim with very pertinent and convincing evidence. Much of the political literature I've experience has been bogged down with political biases of the respective authors; but this book fortunately supersedes political ideology and simply tells it like it is. In my opinion, this should be read by every American."
4,A fun chick flick,"Wind is for all intensive purposes a romantic comedy. But there's just enough action and adventure to keep it interesting for ""him"" too. Jennifer Grey at her absolute cutest."
3,Wind,"16x9 video excellent, crummy DD 2.0 soundtrack not so much. Oh well, guess this pretty good sailing movie is just too old to have a 5.1 soundtrack. Replaced my VHS with this DVD, definitely an improvement. If you're a sailor, and remember Dennis Conner, you'll like this movie."
4,Great,I have always loved this movie from the time I first saw it. It has taken me a number of years to get the DVD but it was well worth it. The chemistry between Modine and Grey is what adds to the story which is essentially about a boat race.
4,"For sailing, world cup and John Toll fans","This is an older but interesting film for anyone who loves sailing and beautiful cinematography. I bought it for my godson who is learning to sail. It is good for teens and up. My interest was due to it being one of the earlier films of academy-award winning cinematographer John Toll (Braveheart, Thin Red Line).The classic underdog story follows an original path to a World's Cup finale and the film is a good afternoon amusement."
4,Visually dazzling with the muscle of racing,"Watching a sailboat race from the shore is like watching paint dry. But Carroll Ballard (also did The Black Stallion) brings to the screen the dazzling beauty and raw energy of racing, making you feel that you are there, changing sails, getting soaked and holding your breath til the finish line."
4,For those who love to sail...,"This is the story of the wind, a boat, and the people who wanted to win The Americas Cup with her. It is worth watching just for the photography! Their's is a story of determination and hope. If you're a competitor of any sort, plus enjoy sailing or love to watch the ballet of a sloop across the water, don't miss this gem."
4,Love Beats to Windward!,"Please tell them to stop ruining good technical action films with hokey love stories. This film has the best footage of any sailing action I have ever seen, and I have been involved in same for some years now. This movie would have been a cult classic for the ""sailnuts"" if not for that weak plotline of Mathew Modine's and Jennifer Grey's on again, off again love story. No disrespect intended for the the cast, but those responsible for tainting this exciting story with mere human romantic foibles, should be keelhauled, lashed with the ""cat"", or better yet, forced to watch bad romance novels made into ""B"" movies (ala Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange""). Bad love story aside, this is a great flick to watch if you love sailing."
5,I got it in Japan.,"I was able to see this DVD.However, I do not think that the region code has the necessity."
2,"Good footage, poor movie.","Some of the sailing footage is fun to watch. My favorite is the 14's racing in Newport. The love story part of the film is silly and its adaptation to a sailing context is strained, but where the movie very seriously loses it, in my view, is in the weird depiction of ""technical"" aspects of sailing. For the most part, this is downright embarrassing.The funniest is when they come up with the innovative ""whomper"" sail. I have heard non-racers comment on the movie to the effect of ""Why didn't the other racers think of that sail?"" to which the answer is, of course: ""It's against the rules."" But I have to thank ""Wind"" for coming up with my favorite nick-name for asymetrical spinnakers!"
4,DVD? About time!,"It's about time this movie arrives out on DVD, the sad thing is that this movie came out about 1992 (over 10 years ago) and by today's standards, Wind is a bit hoakey. The storyline is unbelievable and the fact that 12 meter yachts are being raced in the America's Cup is a bit antiquated. On the plus side, the soundtrack is excellent, and the cinematography <sp> is some of the best that I've ever seen. The aerial shots are especially mouthwatering. The movie puts you right in with the yachts; on a big t.v. with DVD quality picture and sound, it should be breathtaking."
5,"sailing techies, rejoice!","Wind is a great film... anyone who's ever spent time on a racing boat can watch for technicalities, but the thrill of sailing is a rush for everyone. I've waited a long time for this dvd!"
4,not a sailor but I too am waiting for the DVD,"I first saw this movie in the early 90s, on a plane ride from New York to San Fransicso. I happened to look up and fell in love with this movie. I've given my copy away to friends, twice but found I missed having this movie too much. So, I logged onto Amazon hoping to find a DVD version, but alas. I am not sailor, but I love this movie, the cinematography, the story, the inspiration. Watch this movie!"
4,Wind,"As a sailor I have not seen a better depiction of what it ""feels"" like to sail. I agree with the others.....WHERE is the DVD version...and WHERE is the soundtrack"
5,One of the best films ever and still not on DVD?,"Still one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a shame that the studio hasn't moved it to DVD format yet. Maybe the second time around in DVD it will get the acclaim it deserves."
4,spectacular sailing footages but poor romantic story.,I agreed with every reader 's comment on this movie. It is the most spetacular sailing movie I ever see. But the love story was not directed with any meanings. Also I agree with others is: When will they release a DVD version of this movie?
5,"Good, exciting and nostalgic fun","I purchased this vid for my mother, who was a big Liz Taylor fan at the time when Taylor (and my mother) were young. My mom's 81 now, and still really enjoyed this film. In fact, she wound up viewing it and sending it to her granddaughter (now 13)who is a horse lover. The verdict is not in yet as to whether it'll be too dated for her, but so far it's a big hit for the young and, well, not so young."
5,Great Movie,"National Velvet is my favorite movie. This movie never left me back, kept me interested, and made me love the characters, even with their faults and problems. Mi (played by a young Mickey Rooney)was a jockey when he was young and got into a bad accident during a race. He was scared from the situation and stayed as far away from horses as he could, until he met Velvet. (played by Elizabeth Taylor) Velvet was a young girl who was horse crazy and dreamed of owning her own horse and racing in the Grand National. Mi becomes a better person staying with the Brown family, and overcomes his fear of horses. I really want to find the sequel to this movie. I heard of one, but haven't seemed to find one. anyways, great movie, i recomend it to everyone, young and old. Wonderfully played..."
4,National Velvet,"I thought that I wouldn't like this movie when my grandmother reccomended it. I WAS WRONG! I loved this movie so much! National Velvet is the story of Velvet Brown, a young girl who is obsessed with horses. On the way home from school one afternoon, Velvet runs into a boy named Mi Taylor. He comes home with Velvet, and Mrs. Brown says that he can stay and work with Mr. Brown. Velvet is delighted! One day while delivering meat with Mi, Velvet sees their neighbor's new horse jump the fence. Mi is astonished! The neighbor's horse that Velvet calls 'Pie' has jumped a six foot fence! This is the perfect horse for the Grand National race! Velvet wins the horse and she and Mi train him for the Nationals. This movie is so exciting and I love it! If you like horses, you'll love National Velvet!"
4,Good movie,Oldie but a goodie and the quality is good too. if you like Old movies than this is the one for you.
5,A true classic,"What can I say. I have had a video copy of National Velvet since the age of 10 and have finally upgraded to a DVD copy. The story is timeless, quoting an old advert ""a story about a girl, a boy and a horse"". Totally true, but also so much more, a host of memorable characters and a story that has you cheering every single time. The perfect feel good, genuinely nice family story. Ideal for bringing out when you need a little lift, or a bit of nostalgia. Everyone should own it."
2,Poor treatment of a classic,"""National Velvet"" is a wonderful movie, for all ages. Frankly, I'd consider it one of the best ""sports"" movies ever made.Sadly, Warner Brothers DVD release leaves a lot to be desired. The picture frequently goes out of focus, and the disc is bare-bones....not even the trailer [promised on the DVD jacket] is included.With Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney still around, you would have thought they'd have either interviewed them, or gotten a commentary track from them for this classic. It would be worth the price to get a ""special edition"" release.Until then, I guess we're stuck with this sorry disk."
3,National Velvet DVD,"I actually love this movie classic and own it on video cassette. I wanted to own it on DVD and ordered it. The quality of the DVD I received is not very good. The picture is sometimes fuzzy and the colors tend to fade in and out. The sound seems to be fine. I think my VCR tape gives me a better playback! I am disappointed, but it would not be cost-effective to return."
5,awesome,If you ever want to be a jockie this is the purfect movie to enspire you. it is awesome and amaising!!!!!!!!!!
3,National Velvet,This is a movie that after watching on TCM I decided I would purchase. It is a pity that the version shown on TV is so much better than this version. There are times when the image registration is so bad you feel it's trying to be 3D. This one needs to be restored to it's original glory!!
4,Young Liz Shines,"It's not hard to see how Elizabeth Taylor became such a big star when you see her as Velvet Brown in National Velvet, her first important role. Besides already being very pretty, she is endearing as the young girl who dreams of her horse winning the Grand National Steeplechase, discovering that she herself may have to be the jockey. The rest of the cast are terrific, with special praise for the understated performance by Anne Revere as Velvet's wise and understanding mother. The sequences at the race are well filmed, the Technicolor beautiful, and the story hits all the right notes. Children, especially young girls who love horses, will enjoy the film a lot."
5,Timeless,"This is a real fun movie to introduce to a young person who has no idea who Elizabeth Taylor and Micky Rooney are. This storyline has often been ""copied"" over the years, and for good reason."
1,Read the book and forget the movie,"I see that many people adore this movie and consider it a classic, and I admit I was ready and willing to love it as well. It is one of my all time favorite books, and I have read it so many times that I have lost count. It is a wonderful tale, but the movie hacks it to peices, the dredges the managled corpse of the book in sugar, and serves it to veiwers. I was heartbroken when I watched it, and could not bring myself to finish it. Hopefully someday someone will make a movie that does justice to the complexity of the characters since this movie did not deliver in any way. My advice is save money and aggrivation and forgot that they even made a movie and just read the book."
3,sweet & honest fluff,"the legend is that this movie made elizabeth taylor a star, but in reality nobody knew what to do with the child-woman and it was many more years before she got another role of any importance, all the while remaining a sexual curiosity in a post-ww2 world. the movie itself is a pleasant bit of fluff, highlighted by some spectacular scenery and top-notch supporting work by the likes of anne revere, donald crisp, and (the ACTUAL star of the movie) mickey rooney [omigod! is HE still alive?]. i cant imagine anyone loving this movie, but i cant imagine anyone hating it either."
2,Tough read,I had to get this book for a class... it is a very tough read. Its challenging to figure out what you need to take away from the chapters.
1,Redundant especially if you have another CD in the series,"There are three CD's available in this series, Meditation, Self-Hypnosis and this one. All of them follow the same format: an introduction to whom Edgar Cayce was, a definition of the topic and finally at the very end, a short guided meditation followed by more talking that instructs you on the benefits of using the meditation often. I'm a great fan of Cayce, but this series completely ignores the needs of the listener who in all likelihood knows who Cayce was, wouldn't be considering the CD if they didn't understand the topic and is anxious to hear the meditation they ""thought"" they were buying. Unfortunately the CD is 90% annoying, condescending discussion and 10% meditation. I would recommend Sylvia Browne's Tools for Life over anything in this series. She has some nice meditations on several of her audio books and unlike the narration on this CD, the talk portion is very entertaining."
1,warning,"if you are a lover of the work EDGAR C you will not waste your hard earned money on this rubbish,it begins with a slight mention of him and then goes off on its own course.Edgars work was all about the road to the development of the christ consciousness within, in line with the teachings of Jesus.This however is not the case but if you listen to this and carry out what it say's you may aline yourself up to something not so nice.ps this product does not carry the A.R.E seal."
2,Don't hold your breath,"I suppose I've become jaded in my years, but I had expected ""more"" from this cd. Oh, well, you can't win them all. If you're a novice to the Cayce experience, you might enjoy this more."
4,Biiiig Liiiion!,"I saw this one on tv, and ever since, we've been calling our cat the big lion. The animal guy has a canadian accent, and they way he talks is quite amusing. There are some amazing scenes where he plays with a baby lion and chills out right next to a family of lions."
5,Vibrant!,"My favorite Celtic compilation album of all! I don't think I could describe ""Bravehearts"" any better than its back cover does: ""proud, passionate, provocative--keeping tradition alive by refusing to let it stand still ..."" Full of energy, bounce and spirit, all the numbers on this CD, both lively and driving or poignant and slow, have an intensity about them that just sweeps over you. The artists featured are: Leahy, Capercaillie, Blair Douglas, Mary Jane Lamond, Ashley MacIsaac, Dougie MacLean, Karen Matheson, Old Blind Dogs, Anna Murray, Skyedance and Tannas. It's hard to pick a favorite track or two here--I like every one, though Blair Douglas and Leahy really shine. Come along and celebrate the spirit and mystique of Scotland with these innovative new musicians! If you enjoy ""Bravehearts"", you'll also enjoy the up-tempo music of another compilation CD, Green Linnet's ""Playing With Fire""."
5,Fantastic!! A [happy] clone novel.,"Just finished in two sittings and could not put it down. What a great idea for a book, and the science end of it is fascinating. At times funny others sad it comes to a wonderful conclusion. And you know no one has to die. What a refreshing novel. I would recommend anything by this author."
3,A good read spoiled by poor quality printing.,"A fun book to read, but it's a shame that the printing and reproduction of the illustrations is not up to the quality of the text. The original publication had sharp, clear print and clean, narrow lineweights in the graphics. In this edition, much of the illustration text cannot be deciphered. I recommend finding a used copy of the original edition with multicolor cover."
3,"interesting thoughts, but hard to get through","I bought this book out of my admiration for Muir's Volkswagen Repair Book, and while it is written in the same conversational dialogue as the repair book, it seems to get bogged down in the details of his plans for making a better society. There are many parts of Muir's philosophy in this book that I do like. ""Humankind must learn to progress without Contention"" is one of my favorites. Anyone who tries to make a valiant effort to fix our society is alright in my book and if you want to read a book that will get your brain thinking about alternative rules, you will probably like this book."
4,Inspiring social Utopian treatise,The author carefully lays out a detailed design for utopia & has inspired much of my own thinking about What Could Be. Don't be put off by the 60's-era writing style. The illustrations are also excellent. This book is provocative and well worth reading.
3,"Ok, but it has a few problems","I would say if your child really likes Care Bears then it is a good toy for you. If your child likes checkers you might not want this toy. The Care Bears sit on white and light blue clouds, which are not easy to tell apart. Also the board could be stronger. My 1 year old had the board for 2 or 3 mins and was able to rip it in half."
2,Heifetz or Oistrakh instead.....,"Perlman spends his time in virtuosity, but the issue is more with the orchestra where Levin's direction is totally neutral, lifeless and even boring in some moments... Definitely try the Grumiaux version, Oitrakh (EMI) or Heifetz (Sony). Personnaly i like the power and fantastic sound deployed by Oitrakh's violin in all his records, certainly the most impressive: this man had an incredible force in his arm to play so nicely and he is unique. Heifetz (Sony) is different and in the fourth and fifth concerto, so emotional that you listen the records everyday with the same admiration and emotion. Then you realize why Mozart was unique, and also why he deserves that artists make the effort at least to be lively when playing his music and not monotone. Mozart violin concertos are uncomparable, and I would advise staying away from this record."
4,Good Album,"If you are a Bob fan, you will enjoy this album. Lorena and Chinatown are excellent songs and this album's version of Big Blue Sea is better than Lonelyland's."
5,Not Your Traditional Christmas Classics!,"I just finished spending an entire week listening to this CD in my car. Literally, I found myself sitting in the parking lot for an extra-long amount of time just so that I could hear the end of a song before leaving my car. By far, this album is the most original and modern mix of some of my Christmas favorites.As with any Christmas album, I always expect to be able to sing along to my favorite tunes, but with this one, I just listen because I'm so impressed by the way Offering changed the cords and tempo to make these songs totally fresh. I recommend this CD to anyone, especially people looking for a fun new twist on some of the best Christmas Classics. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!!"
5,A new groove for Christmas Music,"These tracks are familiar to us all, but the sound and style is unique and exciting to listen to. Offering is a large group of diverse musicians, with acoustic violin, flute and cello up to synthesizer, so the sound is cool and eclectic. A great change of pace for the season, even this time of year (May).Check out ""Breath of Heaven"" for an awesome rendition of this emotional song! It was my favorite of the newer songs. For a version I almost danced to, there's ""God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen"", with intense drums. In all the songs, the lazy, bluezy vocals tone down the usual perky seasonal sounds nicely, so it's easy to listen to more than once. Thanks Offering!"
4,'Tis the Season (Amazing Vocals!),"If you want to get in the Christmas spirit, pop in this cd, chill by the fire and get a nice warm cup of coffee. Offering has done an excellent job, capturing the Christmas spirit on this album. The music is well arranged, and the vocals are amazing! Relax and enjoy the rich, refreshing sound of Offering's ""Comfort and Joy"".""Christmas Time is Here"" and ""O Come O Come Emmanuel"" are two of my favorites on this album."
5,A brilliant collection of sustainable architectural works,"Arquitectura del Vacio is an extensive selection of the architectural works designed by Melvin Villarroel. The 239-page book presents twenty-seven of Mr. Villarroel's finest works understood through a wide array of pictures, photographs, drawings, renderings and sketchs, and easily communicated in Spanish and English. This book encapsulates twenty-five years of experience -- no other architectural ""best works"" comes close to its breadth, depth and lasting impact. Every page exhibits the natural elements that exist in perfect harmony with his designs. The descriptions of the golf resorts, luxury hotel resorts and harbor resorts are clear, thoughtful and marked by a strong philosophy that is unshakable and visionary. The book is every bit as ambitious as it is a great value. Mr. Villarroel's book is truly inspired, and I recommend it to any reader looking to understand sustainable architecture in all of its glory."
5,Beethoven Sonatas Rock,I gave it five stars because I didn't find anything wrong. It is my CD of the month and I like it better all the time.
5,Fun Toy,"I love this starfighter. I would have to say that this is my favorite of the three new ones (they're all the same model- just a matter of what your favorite color combination is). For anyone considering purchasing this- the photos are very accurate depictions of the toy. It has two firing missiles that are not revealed until you press the button for the wings to open up, which is a great feature. TO ALL WHO CANNOT FIND A FIGURE TO PLACE IN AS A PILOT- I found the Obi-Wan figure from the Target exclusive drinking cup to be the only figure who will fit comfortably in the cockpit. He may not have the pilot head gear- but, he is an Ep. III figure with the Ep. III look. I tried an Ep. II Obi-Wan in the cockpit and it just didn't look right in this Ep. III vehicle. Go to Target and get the cup for the figure- unless you want to wait until the Obi Wan pilot comes out later this year."
4,Murder and suspicion envelope four young men......,"Val McDermid tells a story of four friends who discover Rosie, a dying young woman, as they are drunkenly making their way home. The young woman dies despite efforts to save her. The young men are suspects in Rosie's murder although the police can find no clear evidence to charge them, there is also no strong evidence to clear their names, and no other suspects seem to exist. The young men's lives are overshadowed by these events and many things turn out quite differently than they had hoped for.The second half of this novel jumps ahead 20 some years. As the anniversary of Rosie's death again approaches, death and suspicion raise their ugly heads again and everyone is again thrown into a nightmare of a spotlight. The confusion, hate and fear wrap themselves around the characters in a dark blanket of hopelessness. The only way out is for the person(s) who murdered Rosie to be revealed. The question is, who will survive the investigation!!!"
4,Far fetched and distant,"This book does not when it comes to story development and characters that are described in it. It keeps the reader interested and guessing but it falls short with respect to the actual culprit. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars."
3,Interesting but flawed book,"As a reader of mysteries who does her best not to figure out who did it, I found this novel disappointing--it was far too easy to guess the murderer. And once I had figured that out, the defects in the characterization of the quartet of witness/suspects become more glaring; the four seemed increasingly to be designed to exemplify contrasting elements rather than to develop as real people. McDermid's Place of Execution was a far more affecting book. For Scottish mysteries, I still prefer Ian Rankin and Denise Mira."
1,A Distant Cry From A Place of Execution,"Really this is two books in one. In the first half the characters are fully drawn and very believable, the plot line is taught, and well written. Unfortunately, the second half of the book where the characters have moved to middle age is disastrous. The characters become card board cut outs and the plot is extremely contrived. If you do not see the ending coming you have not been paying attention. A huge disappointment after enjoying tremendously A Place of Execution. Maybe the title should read A Distant Second."
2,I Must Have Read A Different Book,"While I thought A Place of Execution was terrific, this was a terrific disappointment. You could guess who did it early on and while there was still a surprise or two, the plot was contrived, the characters were one dimensional and the dialog was stilted. As I read the other reviews, I can't help but wonder what I missed."
4,The Distant Echo,"This is the first novel by Val McDermid that I have experienced. I plan on trying others. This is quite an enjoyable read. A few slow spots, but enthralling and captivating for the biggest part. The story is quite believable and could quiet conceivable really have happened. I'm not going to give away anything of the story, you can read the official reviews. I'm just going to tell what I really think of the book.It's a darn good read and worth buying."
3,Wordy Scots mystery,"I've read other McDermid books I've liked better, especially the ""Tony Hill"" series, but this was good - just not great. It might have had more of a chance for greatness if about 200 pages were cut out of it. Beyond wordy.Character development was excellent. I also enjoyed the descriptive passages about Scotland. I guessed who the killer was right at the beginning of the book so it IS a testament to McDermid's writing skill that she kept me entertained enough to finish the entire book and still enjoy it.This is a book to read while curled up in front of a warm fire, snowing outside, drink of choice in hand, with no plans for a few days, drifting off to nap once in a while. Because you do get involved in it and just keep reading along. Good just not great."
3,More of a character study than mystery,"I figured out who the killer was very early in the story, but kept reading since I figured Ms. McDermid would have some great twists and turns thrown in, but that never happened like in other books of hers. Instead, I was treated to an overly long look into the lives of several men who were witnesses in a murder case.This wasn't a bad book per se, but it wasn't what the cover or the author's previous track record suggested. I'd file this one under literary fiction rather than mysteries and thrillers."
3,Good story if a little predictable,I rated 3* simply because I knew from the early chapters who the murderer was. Despite having one or two doubts at various points throughout the book my initial conviction on who was guilty proved to be correct so the read was more an exercise in proving my instincts rather than an edge of the seat thrill.I would recommend this book and the author to those who like an easy tale rather than something to test the brain.
3,The Distant Echo,"Not my favourite McDermid book, I became very frustrated with the story. Four students who stumble upon a barmaid dying and run for help are accused of her murder. Their lives are ruined because they did the right thing, I prefer to believe that as long as we do the right thing everything will work out., this book made you wish they had walked away from the body and left someone else to find it. I read The Distant Echo after reading A Place of Execution which is a brilliant book, I was very disappointed with the book."
3,Not MacDermid's Best,"Distant Echo was a disappointment to me. I figured out who the killer was half way through the book. I checked at the end to see if I was correct, and I was. I lost interest in the book after that. It just dragged on and on so I stopped reading it."
3,"Entertaining, But Just Okay","This novel was entertaining, but not great. Some parts dragged . When the charcters were youger, they were more interesting than when they got older. The story is a little slow at times. I would have never have guessed who committed the crimes. It is a B book."
3,Good but not Great,"Probably no one enjoys a great whodunnit more then I do, since I was raised reading everything Agatha Christie. I am always on the look out for a good old who, how or why dunnit. This book came close to the mark but missed. Don't know why the evil-doer was telegraphed so clearly and early, because surely the author didn't mean for it to be so obvious.The characters and story line were interesting. Totally agree with other reviewers this could have been trimmed by about 150 pages and been a tighter script.Loved the language and sense of place in the beginning chapters. By the finish of the book I was ready for the end to come.3 stars only"
5,An absolute pleasure...,From the early Tony Valentine novels to this one I enjoy them more and more. The characters become clearer. As a gambler the scams are often dead on and there are just enough turns to keep you guessing! A great fun read.
3,"Elmore Leonard, he 'aint. But.....","Florida, colorful criminals and various other supporting cast members, as well as a review on the book jacket that compares him to Elmore Leonard...does not make him so.I hate how more and more fiction writers want us to take huge leaps and suspend our disbelief. [Next line is a spolier] - a keith moon like drummer it turns out never did his drumming...he merely had a midget playing in a hiddens speaker behind him! What!?Now onto the good stuff - decent story otherwise. Love the main character who shares gambling stuff without promoting it, gives the reader the inside feel.If I could, I would give this 2.5 stars...since it was good enough to make me want to read another of his, I gave him a generous 3."
4,A touch of Hiassen,But as entertaining as ever. It's fun to learn while being held captive to the page.
5,Very Very Good,"I just can't see how anyone could give this less than five stars. Everyone did such a good job, and the sound quality is excellent for an old recording. Who cares if it wasn't performed in the ""authentic"" Baroque style?! All I know is that the tempo suits the text for both works. If you like Bach's choral music, you can't go wrong here."
3,Adequate performance of Magnificat,"I bought this CD specifially for the Magnificat. The choir has a mature and well-balanced sound in general, but their pronounciation of the Latin is unconventional-- all the consonants are hard. Also, Richter takes major liberties with the tempi, most noticeably at the end of Fecit Potentiam, where he slows down to (at most) one-fourth of the previous tempo. The rallentando here is over-exaggerated. Also, the soprano singing Et Exultavit is noticeably warbly. However, Quia Fecit Mihi Magna is wonderful, if the tempo is a bit pokey, and the chorus numbers are very satsfying. This recording has its faults, but is not so awful as to wreck such a beautiful work as Bach's Magnificat."
2,Dreadfully slow---not at all like Bach,"This performance is dreadful. It is so slow as to be painful. Yes, you can recognize the familiar melody, etc., but it just doesn't sound like Bach. Also, the soprano soloist (there are two---not sure which one as I write this) is way too operatic."
2,Bach for elephants,"First of all, I admire the late Prof. Richter, who was indeed a great Bachian. I have even had the privilege of attending concerts of him conducting his own Munich Bach Choir. However, to me, this is yesterday's Bach - too slow, too ponderous, too overly reverent. The newer performers of this sort of music (notably Gardiner and Suzuki) have shown the way, and they are better in every department. To me, this is useful as a historical record to show how such music was once performed, but not for real musical pleasure."
3,Didn't seem like traditional Channellock quality,"It looked good, was packaged well, but the edges were sharp and had not been milled cleanly. Seemed like a cheaper version of what I was expecting. Not bad enough to send back, but I will have to spend a few minutes with emery cloth and a fine file to make it feel like it's a quality tool made by a company that cares - can't help but wonder two things: was it made in China or Taiwan or made here by guys who no longer care."
2,math text,This book was not very helpful. Not detailed enough. Can not be used alone to teach someone the subjects that it contains.
1,Dissapointment,"First off, for me the second CD didn't even play at all for me but somehow I didn't seem to mind that much as this is an awful CD with the exception of a couple of good tracks. It consists mostly of former hair metal bands covering other hair metal bands songs. Additionally, some of these cover bands I never heard of. I agree with the reviewer above. This box set is pretty much good for only one thing: a coaster set."
3,Good general history,"Thorough history of the Ottoman involvement in the Great war from the Turkish perspective. Extensive use of Turkish sources strengthens the book. lack of comparative analysis weakens it.Overall, a good local history."
5,Dumbstruck,"Freaky and fabulous. I am awed by this guy's imagination. (I also found it a little uncomfortable to walk home at night after this.) For the few days it took to get through it (it's thick) this thing completely took over my life. Original, powerful and well worth multiple readings. (Read KING RAT before this one, or you won't like KING RAT as much.)"
3,not satisfied,"I agree with the reviewer who said the book was disappointing.I absolutely LOVED 95% of the book, but the last 5% broke my heart. I feel completely cheated.I'm trying hard not to spoil anything here, so if I sound cryptic, I apologize, but the one thing that they tried to acheive throughout the entire book they did not succeed at, nor did they fail at. They simply did not do... and it felt like a cop out. Which makes no sense at all! This book is full of the most fantasic ideas, complete steam-punk fiction with a chunk of fantasy thrown in, and yet the end is as flat as a prime time cop show? Sad."
2,Interesting for 3/4 but not wrapped up well,"This guy's imagination is really something but it fails him for the last 1/4 of the book. Entire interesting plot lines are just dropped (what happened to the city administration anyway?). Conflicts and ambivalence are a big part of the book the whole way through but they lose meaning when they are caused by the author just not knowing where to go with the story.It is an interesting read, but really unfortunate that the brilliant vision fades out so badly when it came time to tie up story lines."
5,"Can't come up with a title for my review, no way.....","Okay, I closed the book and said one word, out loud, to myself: WOW. I also immediately ordered the UK hardcover because this book is definitely for those who keep copies of treasured books. It is so strange, so different, so alien. There's nothing like it that I've ever read. You know, I trust folks' reviews, I order the books they recommend, and more often than not I'm disappointed. NOT THIS TIME. This book will bend your mind."
1,Best doorstop I own.,"One of the worst books I have ever read. The combination of a sloppy plot, which goes everywhere, and Mr Mieville's tendency to ramble on about nothing made reading this book a perverse act of self torture. It takes almost half the book for anything to really start to happen and when it does it is so uninteresting and uninspired you loose interest. It's almost as if he ran out of steam half way through writing it and just slapped anything together to make a deadline. A real disappointment."
2,Impenetrable,"I like to read, I do it almost everyday. I don't think that I'm an especially intelligent person, nor do I think I'm too stupid. I work as a neuroscientist and am generally able to speed my way through novels. That being said, reading through Perdido Street Station was more of a challenge than a pleasure. This is not a quick read, something you can sit down a bit sleepy at the end of a long day and read. Rather, this is a book that requires a bit of focus and a critical vocabulary to understand. The author would never say that something fell out of a window, rather he dedicates almost two pages to how a food basket falls. This adds character to the environment, but makes for an incredibly long, dense read, especially when the vocabulary used to describe these actions is at the least scholarly in caliber.I'll keep reading, but a few chapters in and I'm not impressed."
1,"If this is the future of horrorpunk, I want no part of it...","This book is a mess, and when one reads it, you can almost hear the self-conscious rattling of the author and the genre he's trying to ""expand"" but just fails on almost all levels. Here is a world where all sorts of fantastic technology exist, yet things like a telephone or radio are unheard of. The language and metaphors are cumbersome, and author uses every chance he gets to use ""flesh"" like that makes things more terrifying.Also, I would add that this is more of a Fantasy novel than anything else. If you want something well-written without 1-dimensional characters, try Dan Simmon's ""Hyperion"" series."
1,worst fantasy ? science fiction I have read in 35 years.,"this is not a novel,it is a mishmash of undeveloped ideas and story lines which never find a resting place."
5,The first of Mieville's Excellent Series,"The first in the series, an excellent pseudo horror novel. Full of monsters and a wonderfully well imagined steampunk kinda world. Mieville is an honest to god socialist, and that comes through in this book and the way it imagines the social relations between people in a city gone horribly corrupt. Even the monsters, which feed off people's dreams, can be seen as a n allegory for much else that is going wrong in the city.But, political as this book is on one level, it isn't at all heavy handed, and there is no reason those (like me) who don't share Mieville's world view won't absolutely love this book. This one is really worth getting if you're into this sort of thing. A by ""thing"" I mean excellent sorta steampunky horror fantasy things."
4,Excellent Speculative Fiction,"China's Perdido Station is a great story told in an unbelievably ugly world setting. Cruelty is the norm. Ugliness is the canvass. If you don't mind the descent, this is a story that is well worth the read. Excellent execution on the narrative; the theme(s) are coherent and China pours on the imagination. Buy this book!"
2,"Ponderous, I can't recommend it.","A friend let me borrow this book so I felt obligated to finish it, but I would not have otherwise. The pacing is awful. The plot does not really get going until halfway through, but even so, I actually felt the first half was better. The introduction to the setting and the characterization is excellent in the beginning. The ultimate enemy however, introduced far into the book, is comparatively boring. The spurious details and pointless sidetracks also become extremely tiresome in the second half.The author has a talent for description, world building and social commentary, but story arc, pacing, and action leave a lot to be desired. Maybe he has matured in his later books.Great books are hard for me to put down, this one was hard for me to keep reading."
5,What a Ride!,"This is a superb work. I would rate it as right up there with Lord of the Rings. Somehow, the author has managed to weave magic into a sordid backdrop of a sort of ghetto slum. I would not have believed that would work, until I read this book. What stands out is the attention to detail. At no point are we left wondering about what a certain place would like, smell like and even feel like. So often, SF and Fantasy writers skip over these details in pursuit of a complex plot. But it is these details that make such a story feel so real. The point of novels like these is to transport the reader into another world, a sort of temporary escape from the humdrum. The author does this wonderfully. I cannot put this book down."
3,"Inventive, but Hard to Read","On the plus side, the world of New Crobuzon is incredibly rich and detailed, and the plot was interesting. I'd give it 5-stars for creativity. On the down side, I found the main characters' actions unsympathetic and their mannered speech increasingly annoying. They were probably written that way-- not so much ""heroes"" as people plunked into a situation-- but the book was too long for me to not really like the characters, even if the world they lived in was very cool, and I had to force myself to finish it."
3,Colorized SF,"I had gotten away from SF/Fantasy because of the cliches and banality of the genre, but this one sounded like it wanted to go in new direction, so I gave it a shot. I was impressed with Mieville's prodigious imagination and command of the language, but ultimately this book fell short of its mark. It's still basically genre fiction, ultra-vivid but without anything new to add to that section of the bookstore. Whatever you want to call it - slipstream, goth, etc. - it still creates charicatures rather than characters and plots rather than lives. It's a fun trip - like going to Las Vegas - but leaves you short of a real pilgrimage."
2,Cruel and confused,"Well, to say the least, this is just a very cruel story. It looks like the author have some perverse pleasure to create a narrative only torture his characters. It reaches a point it becomes funny, like a soap-opera. That's the reason for my 2-star rating.On the good side, the background universe is full of original ideas. He also brings some mytical imagery, changing the names just a bit so we can recognize it...very clever."
1,"Horrible, depressing book that lacks an ending","Mieville does create a clear, depressing, opressive world. My main complaint is that the story seemed unfinished. My impression was that part of the ending was the lesson that not all things are possible, but there just seemed to be too many loose ends for such a depressing book."
3,Not bad...,Underneath the weak pseudo-science and the ponderous verbiage lies a reasonably good and highly imaginative story. A good candidate for a Kindle read where it's easier to look up the obscure words that the author has frequently chosen.
4,Wonderfully original and dark,"This is a very long book and probably not for everyone. But if you like original ideas which make you think then I recommend it. I actually loved the book. It is very dark, though and not your usual happy ending type book.I found I needed the dictionary on my kindle quite a lot. But I quite enjoyed that :)"
3,"Good story, but it lost me a few times along the way","The book starts out well, but lost my interest at several points throughout before enthralling me again. It took a little bit of determination to finish it, but it was overall a good story.This definitely gives off a steampunk vibe. It takes the culture of Victorian England, magnifies the darkness inside mankind and transplants that into a fantasy world of its own."
3,"In aggregate, it was just too dark","The writing is strong, though often excessive. Much editing remained undone.The characters are nearly compelling, but despite all the explication of their thoughts and feelings, I never felt close to any of them, which suprised me as the book drew to a close. I expected to be more engaged.I almost liked this book a lot, but it was so unremittingly dark, grim actually, that I was mostly relieved when it was over."
2,"I like how it's written, but not what's written","I'll concur with the reviewers who've opined that Mr. Miéville's overly-descriptive writing style interrupts the novel's flow. No question.But I actually find this style intriguing & engaging -- tho' I'd certainly not want every novel to be written this way.My chief dissatisfactions were that I found the novel too dark, the setting too depressed, and the main characters too unsympathetic to care about.I'll likely investigate other Miéville books that are considered 'lighter', but I chose not to even finish this one."
2,Very disappointing,"China's gift for language is admirable. His descriptions in this book jump right off the page, and the characters are all very well drawn. As well, his powers of imagination are formidable and Perdido Street Station is bursting with originality.However, I strongly disliked this book and put it down--gave it to charity, actually--after reading only 150 pages. Why? Because although I felt like I was really in the world the author created, I detested that world. There is nothing beautiful there, nothing admirable--just filth and misery. When I read a book I want it to be an escape from real life--to someplace better, not to someplace worse.I was also turned off by the scene near the beginning of the main character having sex with the insect-woman. But even though that part was so strange, I kept on reading...and eventually decided that it was just a waste of time.I need something at least a little bit more uplifting and a little less depressing."
3,Long and gruesome,"Te author's imagination and world building here is unique and well constructed. You'll feel like you're there. As mentioned in other reviews here, the setting descriptions are verbose and sometimes take several pages. Much of this could have been trimmed with no adverse effect. The primary conflict doesn't kick in until halfway through the book. Characters pop in and out of the story seemingly at random.The theme of this book could very well be, ""Every action has consequences."" Indeed, every character's action does have consequences and none of them are very pleasant, despite the character's intentions. Some of these consequences are downright gruesome. Once you make it to the halfway point, these and the well-realized, dark and dirty setting make for a very exciting, yet grim read."
5,Both weird and great!,"Being an author, I understand how it can get confusing to write in depth about several different characters that vary in great degree in both appearance and thought but Mieville pulls it off. The character were great and the setting was so off the wall but wrote with such care and skill I felt like I was in this strange alien world he had created. This book is in my top fifty of all time favorites! The only bad thing about this book is you can tell Mieville is a Brit because he loves to use over sized words, many of which he made up, but other than that, it's a great read."
3,Brilliant prose becomes repetitive tripe,"This vivid disturbing world full of interesting peoples, technologies and magic had me hooked for the first half of this book.However it became frustratingly repetitive and the plot went in circles for a good portion of second half of the book."
5,Utter Praise and Mania,"Perdido Street Station is a masterpiece.It had me utterly hooked from the first page. A book bought on a wim for the beautiful cover art, went beyond any possible expectations. In a world as real as the one we live in now, aliens and humans vie for space in a city where the poor and well-to-do stumble side by side. No character is with out its own flaws and problems, even the Aliens are not exempt. Finnaly a novel that steps beyond the safe cookie cutter world of alien human relations. Who said aliens could not be as vile criminal and human as us.If the other books by Mieville are as good as this he has caught a lifetime fan."
5,About Bloody Time!,"It's about bloody time, that a new fantasy novel is just that: new and fantastic. If like me, you love the genre, but like me have got increasingly fed up, nay bored by the constant glut of books in this field that deal with dwarves, elves, albino whatnots on quests for rings, swords, curtain rails etc., by pseudo Tolkein authors; then take a chance on this book, I don't think you'll be disappointed. At last a fantasy book that doesn't assume its readership is 11 and a half years old. Yep! a fantasy book for adult readers. Good plot, good characters, good prose, good grief it's excellent!"
2,What about the Characters?,"This book was very descriptive and paints a great picture of the crazy city. But honestly, I feel like the city was the authors main focus. He takes his time and fleshes it out for pages upon pages. But the characters are completely flat until the end of the book when some character development is thrown in.Honestly I was expecting a fantastic book and got a descriptive piece of junk. I was expecting the Godfather and got Planet earth (discovery channel) instead.Please save yourself and read something else."
2,And now let us save the universe (even as we fornicate with aliens),Many good ideas in here. Except that when all of these are thrown in together with the kitchen sink and anything else that comes handy it turns into kitsch.Mieville might be (or become) a good writer. If he can get out of the SF/fantasy ghetto and get himself a good editor unafraid to ruthlessly prune the author's excesses.
5,Extraordinary!!,This book was absolutely facinating from cover to back! The best book I have read in some time!
5,"purchase this pronto, you won't be sorry","yeah, just try to categorize this amazing book and world! i picked up perdito street station never having heard anything about it or china mieville (someone pronounce his name for me!) my first thought was boy this boy can write....his writing is deliciously tactile: you smell the smells, you feel the substances, you taste the air. he lovingly creates this world nearly as detailed as God made ours. but i also have to admit to being a bit worried that that was all there was to this, just lots of descriptive ambience. oh how wrong i was! what a story! what characters! they leap off the page each one. i gobbled the thing up and then promptly went and purchased all his other works and enjoyed them thoroughly. he needs to be chained to a computer and made to type non-stop...i want more!"
1,Yuck,"I tried my best to ""get into"" this book. But I just couldn't take it. The descriptions were vivid...but I couldn't handle them. I finally closed the book and gave a sigh of relief."
1,Flapdoodle Story/Completely Overhyped BS,"1000 of 99 people found the following review helpful:Apparently I am one of the few detractors of this novel, as I prefer an enrapturing story to tricksy language and weirdness(understatement). Nothing of interest happens in the novel: slake moths break loose to devour the minds of people, a crime boss coming off early as interesting is recharacterized as a complete moron later in the novel, an evil and sentient robot forms out of a junk heap, etc. I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story, good characters, or a good plot.For those in need of a real fantasy series, try outGeorge R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire.This work of genius contains no flowery passages delving into pseudo-philosophical ideas, (Yagharek's point of view), and keeps it real."
1,My first review inspired by the crappiness of this book,"Don't believe the hype. This book is craptastic.What bothered me the most about the book was the weakness of the plot. Things did not develop organically, but major plot events driven by deux ex machina, so that the reader never has any sane ground to stand on.This book is not worth purchasing."
1,Yawn!,"After about 20 pages I couldn't force myself to continue with this FREE Kindle book. It was so dreary, way to much blabbing on and on and on. I have an extensive vocabulary, but the author seems to delight in finding obscure words to obfuscate the text. I looked up the words I didn't know and often found them designated as ""archaic"" in the dictionary. Why use them?"
2,Never met an idea he didn't like,"This book is interesting, at first. There is a strange new world, richly visualized and described. There are unusual characters, about whom the reader learns gradually instead of having everything spelled out. But it soon starts to feel like the author was making it up as he went along. And it could definitely have used a stronger hand in the editing process. It's clear the author never had an idea he didn't like and didn't feel obliged to cram into the story. Every new character is cooler and more outrageous than the last, and they only stay on the stage for a moment before being displaced by whatever new idea struck the writers fancy.By the end, fatigue sets in, and it became a chore to finish the book. And I sort of wish I hadn't, as it had a terrible ending, with the big 'reveal' of one of the main characters making no sense, and the reaction of the protagonist being completely out of character."
2,Ignore the hype,"Whenever I finish reading a book I always ask myself if it was worth the hours I spent reading it. Unfortunately I have to say NO for Perdido Street Station. The book is clearly imaginative but frequently gets muddled in insiginificant dribble that it would be better off without.At the end of the day, the book didn't challenge me, make me think, make me go wow! It only left me with a sense of wonder about why I wasted so much time on it. Mieville is an author with potential but he's not worth the hype he's been getting.On a side note, I did like Mieville's King Rat. Not challenging in any way but at least it was fun and entertaining."
5,An Essential Work of Fantastic Literature,"This is a great novel for anyone interested in contemporary fantasy literature. The writer is very inventive, populating his book with a large, exotic cast of characters--both human and otherwise--and yet none are stereotypical cut-outs; their individuality makes the strangeness of the city come alive. This novel is so good that it will likely be embraced by the mainstream 'literati,' without any acknowledgement of the work's fantastic roots; I see traces of M. Moorcock and the author acknowledges Mervyn Peake as an influence. New Crobuzon is a worthy heir to Gormenghast!"
3,Both amazing and disappointing.,"An increadibly detailed world, and the description of it is captivating. However, at times, this detailed world described with such rich language gets jarred by something being added for the sake of conveniene. It would be more forgivable if it wasn't also saddled with a plodding plot that doesn't start to really start until about 150 pages in, then goes down many dead ends while throwing out red herrings here and there with truely interesting potential.The product of a staggering imagination and a gift for language. But even in the end, I wished it had lost 100 pages or so before getting to me, and I honestly couldn't see me recommending to anyone who hadn't expressed an interest in it already."
5,very well written.,"I prefer his other novel, but very imaginative and interesting. The characters are wonderfully developed. It does get a little slow in places when they almost get the Moths, but then just miss, I really like his mind though. He has a wonderful vocabulary as well. If you like dark, fantasy with a twist you'll like his work."
2,Not Impressed,"I read this book on the recommendation of a couple friends who had said that this is a new, exciting, and different experience. It was definitely different, I'll give them that. However, I found myself not caring about the characters and their motivations. They all seemed flat like cardboard cutouts. There were also several points in the story where events happened that seemed to have on reason for happening, and one of my main sticking points are the few Deus Ex Machina events that happen and pull the characters away from what they were doing. This all led up to an extremely disappointing ending in which a character does a complete 180 from what he had been built up to be throughout the novel.In short, this left me unfulfilled and nonplussed with China Meiville."
4,Great book,"This was my first book to read all the way through on my Kindle...Almost didn't download it after reading the sample. Changed my mind and was very pleased. A great read, in depth characters, great plot that covers a lot of groung. Can't say I would like to live in the city but a great place to read about. A great read for sci-fi and fantasy fans."
4,Just great.,A great novel. At times all the references to streets get a little overwhelming. Yet without the overall description of the city the book could not be complete. Very enjoyable.
3,not for everyone--that's for sure,"Mieville is very fashionable right now, but in general his plotting sucks. What make his stuff readable is he creates great settings, and in this novel the city of New Crubozon is fantastic creation--very well realized. You can almost smell it--he deserves a praise for this."
5,WoW,"I must say to start out , BUY THIS BOOK !!!!I bought this on a hunch , new author , good reviews , and i thought it might be a good read . I was Wrong . I have not been this engrossed in a sci-fi book (i use this term lightly) since Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash . Once you step into China's beautifully rendered world you cannot peel your eyes away.I will not give away the story , but this is one of the best books i have ever read . He makes references to religious figures (khephri , vodyadanoi ) and bends them to suit his willas he shows extreme writing capability in his 2nd and best book so far (in my opinion) . In short this a book not to be missedBuy it now i promise you will not regret it ."
5,Dumbstruck,"Freaky and fabulous. I am awed by this guy's imagination. (I also found it a little uncomfortable to walk home at night after this one.) Original, powerful and well worth multiple readings."
1,Not sure why this book got so many good reviews..,"I really hated this book. It was tedious and overdescritive with really big words that I did not understand. The plot did not make much sence and the characters were jsut an excuse for the author to describe in PAINFULL detail every street every bridge every section of his creation, NEw Crobuzon. By the first hunred pages I wanted to jsut give up and through this book away. You can tell the author is inlove with his creation but it is a horrible place that I care not to visit ever again...I did not feel a connection with any of the characters and did not care if they lived or died...I made myself finish the book, but it was a f-ing chore..."
2,so so read,"just finished reading the book. The story was somewhat interesting.The only thing that almost made me put the book down was the amount of swearing that was used. Considering that this is sci-fi and many words are either spelled oddly (Chymical, elyctrical, etc.) the F-word could have been permuted with something else. It added nothing to the story. I'd rather have seen something ""NEW"" sacre-bleu!"
1,Yuck.,"Ok... I only got 40pages into this one, but it was too much for me. Maybe it's just too dark for me; but I lost interest when the lead charactor has sex with the weird bug lady. Not for me."
1,So deep,If you're a totally hip liberal pseudo-intellectual and like reading about interspecies relationships between human beings and giant red anthropoid bug-things then this is the right book for you!
2,Boring!!,"Perdido street station did have a few good things going for it. Obviously mr. Melville can write beautifully, his descriptions were fantastic. It was very imaginative, his setting and characters are very interesting. Unfortunately those positive qualities alone did nothing for the book since it is extremely boring. Nothing ever happens except that he mentions the words ""cul de sac"" (and a few other words I can't recall) almost every other sentence, I couldn't take it.I don't know how fair this review is since I got about halfway through and could not take it anymore. This is just my personal opinion and I am sure that many other people will love this book. Give it a try for yourself. Final verdict, BORING!!"
2,"Fantastic setup, weak second half","This is my first Mieville book and he had me for the first 300 or so pages. He did a fantastic job making me feel the horror of the city, its drippings and putrid air. The plots were creative and interesting....but these get abandoned for the second half of the book which is basically a monster chase against inter-dimensional moths. I felt like I was reading two books in one, neither of which satisfied the other. As the book wound down I found the reading to be exponentially tiresome, and I didnt bother to finish the last 70 or so pages. It is extremely rare for me to not finish a book.I give Mieville credit for his wicked imagination and for teaching me some new words. There were parts of the book that blew me away, but unfortunately few of these occurred in the last 400 pages."
4,Urban Dystopia,"Perdido Street Station is a great dystopic work of fiction. This is not your typical sci fi/high fantasy blah. I've seen other reviews calling this story linear, like that is a bad thing? There is nothing wrong with a story which although simple in form, actually makes us think about our own society introspectively.The ReMade in this story exemplify cruel and unusual punishment, and it's against this backdrop of corruption you get a sense of urgency felt throughout the story. I have seen a lot of anime and I feel like the world described in this book would make an awesome setting for an anime series. Also, the new Gorillaz album Plastic Beach is a great soundtrack to listen to while reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend to a select few. I also recommend reading We by Yevgeny Zamyatin in congruence with this book."
3,"Imaginative Scenery, Dull Story","The author is very creative, but the story is somewhat lacking and trite. I felt that way halfway through, but finished it just to finish it."
3,Sort of Like Gormenghast,"There were things I liked about this novel; I really enjoyed the world Mieville created, his descriptive writing creates an amazing atmosphere for the story to unfold in. There were things I really didn't like; his characters struck me as flat and at times really annoying. Specifically the main character Isaac, I think he's supposed to be a ""mad scientist"" type but he struck me as a hysterical man baby."
3,DICTIONARY PLEASE,"I was really excited to read this book, until I started to read it....I found that the story was very interesting it was the words I kept having to looking up in the dictionary that slowed me down...If one is going to use Laboratory terms in their BOOK there should be a reference guide in the book....If you read this book get a dictionary and hang on it is going to a bumpy ride....."
3,An astonishinglty complex tale,"Most science fiction creates a universe, a set of operating rules, turns it on and let's the story begin and then travel through to its end. With this story, you are being introduced to new species, new rules of magic and science, in almost every one of the chapters. Which makes the arc of the story completely unpredictable because he's got a whole new thing up his sleeve at every turn. You really have to turn off the part of your brain that keeps asking, how would all these radically different life forms evolve and co-exist? Steam punk weapons and artificial intelligence and magically remolding of people and sentient cactus and creatures that live in multiple dimensions and striking proletarians and drug dealer wars and...?It was a very rich soup, with some beautiful poetic language, particularly in the passages by the bird man who lost his wings for the crime of choice theft."
3,Truly Unusual,"I can honestly say that this book stands alone and is unlike anything else I've ever read.It was a bit tough getting into it--the first chapter, especially--and I found it confusing at first, but I'm so glad I stuck with it and read the whole story.The characters and situations have haunted me since I read the book about two years ago.Truly a memorable read!"
3,gross-out warning,"I'm not actually setting out to review this book - that's been more than adequately covered by my fellow readers. This is more by way of a friendly word of caution; if you are a sensitive person, or have a delicate stomach, this book may be entirely too gross. EVERYTHING is this world is somehow repugnant, decaying, slime-covered, putrescent, maimed . . . you name it. It's really graphic and it's unrelenting, and though I thought this book was well-plotted and it sustained my attention, there are several images I would like to be able to vacuum back out of my head. By the end I felt battered by so much ugliness, and that was after taking several breaks from my reading. If you picked up this book as pleasure-reading, think hard; it may be so offensive to one's aesthetic sense as to undo any enjoyment offered by the story."
1,Wake me when you get original,"I don't remember the last book I read that was as self-conscious as this...and as excited about the cliches it repeats. Mieville lines up ""look at me"" moments one after the other, all presented as new, and all begged, borrowed, and stolen from them who have gone before."
1,Dreadful,Absolutely horrible. Every sentence is packed with as much disgusting imagery as possible. Not my cup of tea.
4,"Whew...the title ""Heated"" did this no justice.","WOW. The title ""Heated"" doesn't do this book justice, it should be ""Inferno."" This book was excellent, it was all that I imagined it would be. There are some steamy but excellent love scenes in this book. On the other hand, at some points the characters (i.e Bianca) actions are not believable. And I also wish the book would've been longer. I would've loved to read more about Karon and Bianca. But nevertheless, this book was a great read! You won't be sorry by reading this one!"
3,Luke warm story - very heated sex,"This book was recommended by a friend from my on-line book club and it is the first that I have read by this author. I loved the cover and the title but the story line was o.k. Bianca King, a very successful Vet, in Atlanta receives a somewhat frantic call from her estranged father. She needs to come home, South Carolina, to help him straighten out affairs before he loses his ranch. Kahron Strong, is the ever so handsome owner of the neighboring ranch, who wants to buy her father out.There is instant Fireworks between Bianca and Kahron. The best part was the chapter long sex scene. (Worth reading twice). Ms. Bryant's story was predictable though a good story to read. I was able to finish it in day. She introduces you to the other Strong brothers which leads to sequals. I will problably check out some of her other titles. All in all, I would rate this book 3.5Peace and blessings!!"
3,TO HOT FOR ME,"HEATED - You can't deny the name doesn't fit the content of the story. Ms. Bryant has once again fascinated most of her readers with her semi-erotica writing in HEATED. I enjoyed Bianca and Kahron's story, but thought the language and some scenes were a bit to heated for my taste. After reading HEATED, I came to the conclusion that there wasn't much to the story after you remove the language and steamy scenes.I have enjoyed all of Ms. Bryant's previous books."
4,Heated..Definitely Hottt!,"This was a very good book which dealt with daughter/father issues as an adult and overcoming hurt from the past of abandonment to help a father save his land. It was full of interest, mystery and most of all romance. It made for a very good read and not boring or not just centering around the budding romance but also incorporated a really good storyline. 4 stars!:)"
2,disappointed,"I felt ripped off. it's a xerox copy of an original text, no paintings come out clearly, no photos come out clearly, everything in black and white."
5,"Exact match, flawless preformance","The A212 blower is commonly used on wood pellet and coal stoves. My old blower gave up the ghost after 10 years of service and neglect. The tiny 10-32 mounting bolts broke over time (a stove design error). The replacement A212 was a perfect match. I increased the bolt size to 1/4-20's and used 314 stainless steel for longevity and the ability to remove the blower for thorough annual cleanings (something that couldn't be done before - snapping the little bolts). The unit is assembled quite well, pushes a good volume of air for its size, and it is nearly silent at normal run speeds. As one may expect, it is a bit noisy at full r.p.m's. The unit arrived within a week and other than the normal electrical connections was ready to go. I highly recommend both the unit and the seller. This unit would also be excellent to cool brake rotors, baked goods, etc. in an industrial applications. It has easily removable grills for cleaning the twin squirrel cage fans."
3,Bad but oh so Good,"This movie lacks all creditability but it's also an old favorite of mine. I've been hoping it will come out on DVD so I can see it again but no luck on that front so far. I really loved this movie in the 80's, when it stood as one of the few 'women kicking butt' films in existence. Movies like this shouldn't be lost to time and disinterest. However, female exploitation movies have a really bad name vs black exploitation films. Perhaps that because women didn't have a hand in shaping exploitation films that showed them out of the normal constraints of the current social mores. I loved this film as a teenager because woman were doing things that the society around me was saying women couldn't do. Today a woman on a motorcycle with a gun as the hero isn't seen as daring, or unheard of, but whne I saw this film, it was shocking. Bring this movie and others like it to DVD. I'd stand in line for a copy."
5,Wonderful,"Mrs. Nietubicz did a wonderful job writing this book. I bought it because she had come to speak to the students I teach at my school, and having heard the three talks she prepared for the three grades I teached, I was interested in reading the book. It's one of the best things I have read in a long time. I think all kids should have to read it, especially those in high school, boys and girls. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Very solid construction, not super high quality","The parts are hefty and it feels like there is no danger of anything breaking loose or failing. The blade holding part is narrow, but secure. I made a kydex sheath for mine and then ordered another in a different color, but the new one(exact same model) is shaped differently enough that the new one does not fit in the sheath the same, otherwise I would give it five stars. Also all of the screws and the pivot seem to be held together with permanent locktite, so dissassembly is not an option(scew heads or threads will strip out), but this also means it will definately not fall apart on you. It folds into more of an oval shape instead of having the blade fully inside the handle like a regular folding knife, so it is not as compact in the pocket as I first expected. The thumb stud is a little far from the pivot so it takes a pretty long reach to get it to open all the way with one hand"
2,Beyond Nuevo Flamenco,"There are great moments on this CD, but to enjoy it you have to have a taste for some world music and some sythesized rythmns. In addition there's a heavy pervading bass that I couldn't get over. These qualities of the arrangement come too close to pop for my tastes. I don't recommend it if you're looking for a kind of nuevo flamenco that sticks to guitar, bass, and light purcussion. This reaches out in many new directions. I sold it back used."
2,Too manufactured for my tastes,"How do I say it? It just lacks soul, and I'm sorry I can't give you a more sophisticated description than that. I'm not a flamenco purist, but I stilld don't care for the artificial sounds of New Age music.I gave this album a good try but couldn't get over the heavy bass and other synthetic sounds in the arrangement that performed more like a computer than a musician. On its own the guitar work was pleasant.However, if your tastes tend toward New Age music and innovative sound mixtures, then this might be for you."
2,Please don't call it flamenco,"It's interesting and pretty music, but it ain't flamenco. Sorry. Neither is Oscar Lopez, Jesse Cook, Armik, etc. I'm not putting them down as guitarists, nor as artists. I'm not putting them down. The trouble is that companies like Narade will put out CD's that juxtapose true flamenco artists like Tomatito, El Viejin, Morente, etc, and mix them with this new age guitar stuff. Unfortunately, the flamenco artists agree to the distribution because they need the money, and these new age guitarists agree to it for probably the same reason. I say save your money and get a Vicente Amigo CD and be prepared to be blown away."
1,Unsure of what he want to be.,"I cannot understand what Jose is trying to do. He is unable to find a style that represents him. He seems talented, but does not represent his talent very well with his selection of weak songs that fail to exude the passion he claims to be trying to communicate."
4,absolutely exotic,This selection will take you to a far way land. I have found myself driving 80 miles an hour down I-95 listening to #5 Asturias XXI. This is my second purchase by Encinas and I am waiting for AURORA to arrive any day. Beauty is said to be in the eye of the beholder......music is no different. You must hear in order to appreciate this album's beauty.
5,Duende is a must-have for Flamenco music,"I personally own this CD along with Heat, Fire and Grace, Obsession and Gypsy Soul. This one is the best."
5,Thank God for Trance!!,"Second installment of the Trip In Trance series. An awesome selection of the hottest trance tracks. What would we do without Trance? Disc one mixed by one of my favorite DJ's, Darren Tate. Wow! is all I can say! This is what Trance is about, music that moves you, hence the word Trance. Euphoric, uplifting, a joyous sound with moving melodies, sweeping strings, very nice mix by DJ Esquille on Disc 2. First time I've heard of him and hope to hear more of him. 5 thumbs up for his mixing as well and his selection of tracks. This is the sound that got me hooked in the beginning, back in 1996-1997 although this sound may have been around a little longer. If you are into uplifting, euphoric, dreamy, beat driven Trance, get this!! You won't regret it!"
2,Half Great,"The Dark Knight Returns is one of my favorite comics, it's certainly my favorite Batman story. It's so well loved by everyone that I doubt any will claim they don't respect it. It's just great, in all aspects, even the ending is perfect.For some reason I never got around to reading the sequel until I bought this edition. Big mistake. The degree to which I love The Dark Knight is in inverse proportion to my hatred of The Dark Knight Strikes Again. These two books don't belong together at all.The style of the sequel is completely different. The artwork is much chunkier and sloppy, the coloring is atrocious and the story didn't matter to me at all. When I got to the end I was actually sorry I had read it.I will sell this and stick with my leather bound copy of The Complete Frank Miller Batman, a superior collection. Absolute editions of comics are well produced and usually worth the money - but skip this one and buy Absolute Watchmen instead."
3,"Half good, half ordinary","I can distinctly remember the pleasure I had reading the original Return of the Dark Knight issues way, way back. A massive, high quality volume like Absolute Dark Knight is fitting for a such body of work. Sadly, the second part is _much_ less interesting in most respects."
1,story botched by art,Big disappointment here. The artwork is so bad i cant believe it - the drawing and the coloring are just ugly. I dont understand why everybody love this book.If you intend to buy it because you read some great reviews be sure to look at the pictures first. you might like it... i did not.
3,"Good, but...","This is a more mellow, very low quality production. But, it's the O.C. Supertones, and if you're a fan you might enjoy this. The cover songs add nothing compared to others who have done those songe (David Crowder, etc) but for Supertones classics redone such as Louder Than The Mob, etc these are more mellower versions than the originals and they're ok. I'm a worship leader and we actually did a version of Louder Than The Mob closer to this version at my church several times as we approached Easter. I love the Supertones so I had to have it, but it's not normal Supertones fair."
3,"Great show, poor disk","I love Shin Chan and I love the episodes but when I buy a DVD, I expect certain things. Like being able to switch from a dub to a sub or vice versa. I didn't see that option! or perhaps a few commentaries or something like that instead of just ... TWO!!! Only two!!I'm happy to support Shin Chan so CN doesn't pull the plug on it like Fox did to another show I loved for 2.5 years!Also for 13 eps and with so little extras, I have to say the disk is also too expensive. Since it plays on CN it's almost a good idea to tape/burn it then it is to buy this dvd.So to recap.The show gets 5 ... no 10 stars. I love this show that muchthe disk gets like 2 or maybe 1 star at most."
5,"I thought if I put the toaster in the freezer, we could make Poptartsicles","This show is so funny! The first time I saw it I was just flipping through the channels and ended up in the middle of the ""To be a man you must have honor..."" chant. I just stared dumbly at the screen trying to figure out what the heck this was. Its a bit odd at times, but that just makes it funnier! A definite must buy for those who aren't easily offended and like wacky humor. Its hard to believe some of the things that come out of these kids mouths, but its tons of fun to watch! This is definitely going to be in our collection!"
5,FUNNY MEST UP COMEDY.,best show i have ever seen about a 5 year old i only saw a few episodes in the past but now going be whole series eventuallyLove how its a story and not all random also
5,it's shin chan...,Excellent adult themed animaic humor. Shin is an obnoxious little boy and it's absolutely hilarious! I highly recommend this if you have an open sense of humor!
5,"Insanely Stupid, But In A Good Way","If you don't mind incredibly rude and raunchy humor and can afford to lose 87% of your brain cells then you may enjoy this as much as I do. I'm excited about all of the episodes coming to DVD but the one I want the most is the ""Star Wars"" episode so if anyone reading this has any authority please release it in a box set!"
2,English Dubbed,"This DVD set from FUNimation will only be in ENGLISH not Japanese with subtitles. Personally I think the Japanese version is better. Why did Funimation re-write the script? Did they think American viewers wouldn't get the jokes? So they could show it on Adult Swim and make it more crude? Lame excuses if you ask me. 99.9% of the Anime you can buy has the option of watching it in English or Japanese. FUNimation, you dropped the ball on this one."
1,Another anime that should be forgotten,"This is by far the most pathetic anime I've seen thus far, and I've seen a lot of anime (over 90 separate TV series). The first thing that tipped me off was the horrendous artwork, as an artist myself I look for quality in the animes I watch and notice when it's lacking. Next is what passes as humor, this is really low-brow stuff, calling it potty humor would be a complement. My advice is when you see this turn and run..... fast, I will not recommend this to anyone for any reason."
3,Amazing Show! Couldn't we have gotten the whole season though?,So I love this show. I am going to buy this DVD and enjoy it completely. My only complaint is the price. Couldn't they have included all 26 episodes for the current price of this DVD? I'm paying $30-plus for 13 episodes. I feel that's a little too much.
2,Skip it!,Skip this item!!! If you are looking for the original Japanese version spend your money elsewhere. The production company changed any and all references to Japanese culture and language - which is one of the best parts of this series as it pokes fun at the anime genre. The original Japanese version is so much better.
1,This dubbing is flippin terrible!,"Funimation should have left this alone. The original was sentimental and nostalgic, as well as crude and disfunctional. Shin Chan was a cute womanizing 5 year old with a severe learning disability. If you are a fan of the original Japanese show, stay clear of this garbage. On the other hand, if you like over the top crassness and cheap American pop culture references every other minute, enjoy.Had a few tapes from the Hawaian TV subbed show, which were brilliant. Hope someone decides to sub the show and release it to DVD."
1,Not what I expected,"I am a huge fan of animé and enjoy a wide variety. My first huge disappointment was the lack of an original language soundtrack w/ English subtitles. What's even worse is that all the jokes and cultural references have been Americanized. Why bother to watch an animated Japanese show when it just sounds like any number of equally lame American shows? And, yes, I do enjoy various animated American shows, too. The final blow was that I just didn't find the jokes to be particularly funny and no, it's not because they're too crude. I do enjoy South Park after all. :)"
4,a good recording,"Mutter plays with great tone, vibrato, and expression. The recording is actually very enjoyable and beautiful to me whenever I listen to it.However, I prefer a slightly faster tempo for Tchaikovsky."
3,not a reference.....,"There are some better versions than this one, Karajan not at his best and sometime too slow. Look after Heifetz or Oistrakh (version with the Moscow orchestra under his conduction)."
5,Absolutely Stunning,"There are not enough stars in the sky to qualify this record. I have heard lots of versions of this op.35, but one has to say that not even Heifetz puts the feeling that Mutter does. Even with Karajan as director (he sets the orchestra too slow in the first movement) Mutter sets the feeling, the passion on the violin part as no other has ever done. If you like this concerto, you HAVE to hear this recording. Simply and absolutely impressive."
1,Never should have been released,"This is a real botch job, from forces you'd expect better of. Karajan is sluggish and tubby and much much too slow and heavy, Mutter is dragged down along with him, and the VPO makes lots of mistakes, and the brass is thin. The audience at the end sounded luke-warm, and so was I, after this labored performance.With recordings by Oistrakh, Stern, Heifetz, Mullova, even Ferras, why this has remained in constant print for over a decade, when the majors are thinning out their classical catalogs, puzzles me. P.S. to you audio guys who bought this recording as some sort of ""reference standard"" for electronics: no wonder guys like you could never fix my speakers."
5,".99 What a deal on ""audience applause""","Only .99 for 20 seconds of audience applause. This is quite a good deal. But I think the audience applause on the Karajan Beethoven was a bit better ($1.12 for 11 seconds) Oh, but what wonderful 11 seconds it was."
2,Unfortunate combo,"Anne-Sophie plays her violin with ultimate fury, the sound is forced and the interpretation forceful. Second movement is beautiful. Karajan is the worse accompanist conductor ever, the orchestra is all over the place. Tempi horribly slow.If you want Anne-Sophie Mutter, get Beethoven Violin Sonatas, just heaven. If you want the concerto, Zukerman with Mehta, perfect in all senses. If Karajan, get Beethoven ninth and all the romantic and german repertoire. But Tchaik, Mutter and Karajan together didn't rock whatsoever. Bah!"
2,Violin Concerto,"Slow, disappointing. It drags I was looking forward to playing it Heard it often on radio, liked it.This recording was not it!"
5,Merci Anne Sophie,Anne Sophie Mutter give such a performance in this record that you want to be on stage! Tchaikovski must have cheered from his grave to this concert. Thank you
3,"Readable, interesting, funny...not necessarily worth a whole book","I enjoyed reading this book. Mr Kimball certainly makes a valid case, and he is appropriately polemical, and scathing. The reason I am giving three stars is that the basic premise is so clear that it doesn't really merit a whole book. The academic nonsense that Kimball skewers is so bad that it is a bit like shooting fish in a barrel, at least if you are sane enough to see garbage for what it is. Perhaps the book would feel more complete is Mr Kimball had elaborated more on his positive approach, the nice, but surprisingly refreshing idea, that we should be content to appreciate the aesthetic quality of great art without politicizing it. Finally, Mr Kimball has the irritating habit of using obscure words that make the text clunky at times, and are downright funny in a book that is critical of academic gobbledy-gook."
4,"If you like Hilton Kramer, you'll love this book.","Aestheticists unite. If you enjoyed reading Hilton Kramer's art reviews in the New York Observer, you are likely to be quite happy with this book. The book is easy to read. Indeed, it's ideal for a flight overseas because it will fit right in your briefcase or purse and won't take more than a few hours to finish. Kimball has clearly done a great deal of work to slim the analysis down to size. If you have been out of school for a decade or more, this short book will bring you quite up to speed in no time on what passes for art criticism. I'd have given it 5-stars if the book had not been dedicated to my Uncle Richard's college roommate. This really should have been dedicated to Sir John P-H, Panofsky or Vasari. Cheers!"
5,BIG FAT LOVELIES THAT EXPLODES IN MY HEAD AND MAKES ME DROOL,I listening to High Scores I found my self lying on the couch drooling on my self. This first track is perhaps one of the best feeling sounds I have yet listen to. The remainder of the 6 track e.p. is enjoyable and well crafted.
4,Still not bored of the Boards of Canada,"I bought Music has the Right to Children over a year ago and have probably listened to it at least 75 times. Although a great CD I was starting to crave something new from BOC. As soon as High Scores was available I had to snap it up. One song is already on MHTRTC, so now I'm down to 5 new songs on this CD. My favorites are track 3 and 5. Unlike MHTRTC you can dance to some of this stuff. I gave the CD 4 stars not because it was lacking quality just that in order get 5 stars I think you need more than 5 new songs. I am waiting patiently for the new full length CD these guys have been planning. I guess the boys are too busy drilling holes in there heads, seriously, or getting freaky at there Scottish bunker. These boys are some weird dudes but they make the best music. If you haven't checked them out Do it. If you haven't heard there style before, the closest thing would be that tune playing in the VW Jetta commercial, very similar genre. ENJOY!"
5,JUST SUPERB,"Everything on this ep tastefully murmurs 'class'. 6 tracks of pure bliss. worth every cent, especially the sublime, final track 'everything you do is a balloon', but there isn't a dud track."
2,Poor dynamics,"I am a great fan of Edvard Grieg. I've even been to his birth place, Bergen, Norway. I was quite dissapointed with this cd. The musicians are very talented but the recording is not the best. The recording is clear but the dynamics are other than they should be. You will find the tension fails to correctly build. The pianisimo sections of the music are so soft that you either can't hear them or if you can, the following section will cause hearing loss."
3,soil with sticks,loaded with sticks and other stuff. lots not ever clean. so i;m using it for my worm farm. it woks well for them.and hold water well
3,great buy but mine had a problem :[,"This toy is very durable and fun to play with.The only problem i had was my ship didnt come with missles. Me and my brother searched in the box, in the bag and on the floor but they were no were to be found.They did not pack them in the box, but other then that this is a great buy i love the little buzz droids that come with it. I also like the little ball thing in the middle of the ship where you store the buzz droids to make sure u dont lose them. I went to toys r us the first day the revenge of the sith line of toys was out (im kinda a star wars geek i got there at like 9:30 in the morning and waited we were first people there) and there was only one of these babys! so buy them before they all dissapear! u should get the arc 170 fighter with this ship"
5,Tri-Fighter : Cool Star Wars Ship,"My son LOVED this ship, which he added to his collection. We had no idea this was even out on the market until we came across it on Amazon/Toys R Us! It is unique, sturdy and full of nooks and crannies for him to store his battle droids. Not to mention that we ordered it on Saturday and it was at our front door by Monday! Thanks for excellent service!"
3,shadowmaker,Katie and her mother move to Kluney for 6 months. Every single night someone comes and tries to break in. Even with the locks they still try to get in. When a carnival worker was killed her best friend turns up missing. The leader of Blitz ask her out. Then they find her friends body and her boyfriend starts wanting her friends journal the soil is btoxic outside of Kluney and her mom investigates that. All Katie wants to do is go home.
5,The Best,"I rate this book five stars because of its great mystery. The book is about a daughter and her mom. The mom was a journalist, she was the one who mostly started the mystery. One night Katie ( the daughter) heard some noises coming fom outside, she got out of bed to see who or what it was. If you want to know who or what it was read the book Shadowmaker. The part I like in the book is when Katie heard the noises because I like the temptation of wanting to know what will happen. What I didn't like is the book moved alone to slow."
5,Wonderful!,This book was great and each chapter left me with a cliffhanger! I couldn't wait to read more of the book. It was awesome! I loved it! Nixon did a great job!
4,Great Product with a Little Temperament!,"This product works as describes. However be careful where you plug in its AC adapter. I plugged it into my Linear Filtering AC sound conditioner and was perplexed that the PowerBlaster would not work on arrival since it was the identical model to that which it was replacing. So I looked at all the variables and realized that the only difference was the electricity supply source. As soon as I plugged its AC adapter directly into dirty wall power, this Powerblaster wagged its functional tail and my wonderful Universal MX-600 Remote went happily back into convenient action!"
5,Works across most of the RF product space,"Included in this kit you get the blaster (the face of the kit) which when viewed with NV goggles shows how much IR light it really dumps out - about 100x what a remote does, plus you get 8 mice to stick over the IR receiver of the products you are controlling, which guarantees they get the signal.Even better, you can put these in multiple rooms and use one remote to operate equipment in various parts of the house."
4,Good CD to unwind to,"The CD consists of quite a bit of thunder. good rain variance, and some animal sounds. The CD is not necessarity a good CD to sleep to. However, it is a good CD to sit in an overstuffed chair and unwind to. Rating 4."
1,thunderstrom raindrops,my husband and i go to sleep by this every night. we love it and so do our cats and dogs
1,Watch out for this one!,"This books gives you a great game-plan to grow a church. Unfortunately, this system has some problems. The primary problem is that there is such a focus on church growth that individual people are left behind. If you're not growing the church, you become part of the problem. The system leaves room for a cultish following of a charismatic leader rather than focusing on individual interpretation of scripture. This system can make you forget too easily that there are some things that are more important than church growth."
1,Wheels had a hard time gripping the track...,Wheels had a hard time gripping the track. It seems that the train needed to weigh a little more. The vender was really great about returning the item. We ended saving up for a O gauge instead.
1,Engine Comes Off the Track,Very disappointed with this set. The engine comes off the track every time it goes around. If the layout was bigger maybe it would not come off but the oval is tight and cannot support the large engine.
1,disappointing train set,"I purchased this train set for my grandson's 4th birthday. Received it in a very timely fashion. Was excited to find a steam engine train set that actually had smoke. Unfortunately, I should have really read the reviews others had posted regarding this train set. The wheels come off constantly and make it very disappointing to play with. It also gets off track very easily. Buyer beware."
3,Frustrating Engine,"I really wanted to get back into model trains. The ""Engine-Tender"".combo is very frustrating. For reality they put extra non-powered wheels on the engine. The kept de-railing. Finally I just took them off to keep the engine on the track. Also, the way the engine and tender connect to each other is, well, frustrating. You have to pick the engine off the tracks to connect the tender. Then get the engine wheels back on the tracks. I know this is standard (I had the same problem with an old Lionel from my childhood, one reason I went to HO), but there has to be a better way. Also, this has ""E-Z track""....should be called ""not-so-EZ track."""
5,Bachmann Trains Overland Limited Ready - To - Run Ho Scale Train Set (Toy),"Not sure why this set gets bad reviews. I received it today, set it up in no time on the kitchen table to test it. it works great. I read the reviews after I bought it and was all worried about the track until it arrived. the cars are fine, some of the wheels had come off during shipping but popped right back in place. out of all the sections, only 2 had to be reset to keep the wheels on track. Would I recommend this? Yes indeed."
4,Interesting Personal Stories about the Lesser known Women in History!,"I gave this book only 4 stars because it jumps around quite a bit, rather than focusing intensively on in-depth personal narratives. That being said, it's very interesting and engaging and I'm learning a lot about the general history of women and their standing in different eras of U.S. history."
1,missing parts,"The audio book was supposed to be unabridged, however there are several sections missing. Including the entire section on the Salem Witch trials."
1,Take my book....please,"I loved this book (note tense). The stories of the women who came early to this country were enthralling. It wasn't until I reached the early 19th century that I realized I was holding in my hand nothing more than the standard, formulaic ""woman as noble victim, heroine, saviour of the race....superior to man in every way....able to leap tall buildings in a single bound,"" etc. ""Lifetime"" for the bibliophile. I thought we were beyond this.In short: one L O N G whine."
5,Don't need to like history to like this book.,"I am not a history buff nor did I take any feminist studies in college, yet I loved reading this book. Gail Collins presents a vivid, albit uneavenly detailed ""panorama"" of women in America over a 400 year span. Much of the material comes from letters, diaries or oral histories, in addition to newspaper reports, so the reader feels like she's actually part of these women's lives rather than just reading about them.What stood out to me was how much more independent and courageous America's women have been from the start of this country compared to their couterparts in the ""old world."" I particularly liked how Collins did not romanticize women or obscure the failings of many of them. Women's impact on American culture is so much more obvious in Collin's account than anything I read in a history class."
3,"Great, except . . .","I wish this book had more complete footnotes. It's informative and so well written -- so wry and funny -- but at times, when I check the chapter notes to see where the author is getting her information, the citation is not there. I found at least one error -- she says that, when a married Puritan woman stepped out on her husband, it was adultery, but when a husband stepped out, it was merely fornication. That is not true -- and my source is a statement by some seventeenth-century Cambridge ministers, as quoted in Morgan's Puritan Family. It makes me wonder: what else in this book is incorrectly stated?"
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"I purchased this book in an act of desperation at an airport bookstore. It turned out to be a great read and one I would recommend to any of my friends or family members. While it can be frustrating to read about how women were treated, there are so many inspirational women in the book. It makes me so thankful for the life I have today. Plus, it read like a good novel - I didn't want it to end."
5,A marvelous book!,"The author worked very hard compiling this fascinating treatise on the history of the American woman. Beginning with the earliest Americans to today, I learned a lot that I hadn't heard before. Interesting details and observations, make you feel like you are really there, living in the century or era described. You can actually feel it, real. Let me tell you! Our foremothers had GUTS and TRUE GRIT.I am a history buff and have been reading up on women's history for at least 20 years. This book is the best compilation I have ever read. Gail Collins deserves a Congressional Medal for this one!"
5,Four Hundred Years of Pop Culture,"I started skimming through this book absentmindedly and soon I was hooked. This is a history that skips all the boring parts. You can start anywhere and find one fascinating fact after another.Mae West got her start on stage in a play that she wrote, featuring male transvestites. She was the Madonna of her day. When Ignac Paderewski, concert pianist, performed in the 19th century, women rushed the stage to throw corsages at him. He was the Tom Jones of his day. American nurses in World War I adapted the absorbent wood pulp bandages used to treat wounds, to create what would become Kotex. I had no idea.The bibliography in America's Women is extensive; you can use it for research, or just to get ideas for more interesting reading."
5,Works great!,"I had a set of Nicholson files (they fit other brands, too), so they work as advertised. They protect your hand and let you exert extra force. I hate to change the handle from file to file, so I bought 4 of these. I use the extra inserts to protect the points of awls, punches and small files. Highly recommended."
2,The worst Textbook I've used,"I have found the editor's notes in this text (the author biographies specifically) to be poorly organized, proofread, and edited. This text has more typos than any other I have read, and the physical construction of the book is also shoddy (the pages fall out).I think the breadth and choice of excerpts is quite nice. It seems that this book had good vision, but is in DIRE need of a good editor, and some logistical re-working.I'm not sure what else is out there on this subject, but I can only assume it is better than this."
3,Letter T necklace,"I wanted a letter T to signify my son's name. Unfortunately it looks more like a cross..not the fault of the company, just the nature of the letter T. It is a nice necklace, no complaints there."
5,A must-have for any HR Practioner,This is a great book for people starting to equipt themselves with the principles of OD. Highly recommended.
5,"different thinking, different book..........","Not only being a student of Rolf's School for Innovators, Thinking Expeditions, as well as a reader of his first edition of The 7 Levels of Change........this 2nd edition is REALLY a significant mindshift and a MUST read for anyone truely wanting to understand the change process......I am a Personal Life Coach and work with individuals in achieving their goals which are always based around SOME change if not RADICAL change and I use the 7 Levels constantly.......I have used them to develop programs that not only explain change but navigate you through the maze that most books get lost in....there are so many examples, so many tools, so many new ideas in the 2nd edtion that I agree with Rolf when he said "" I should have written this book the first time around""....great luck on your journey, you are being guided by the best!!!!!!"
3,Only partial nudity and few young models,"The books contains 54 black and white images. Of those, 19 contain full frontal nudity.The models are for the most part in their late twenties or older. Some are much older.The images themselves are well done for the most part.If you prefer young models and full frontal nudity then skip this book."
4,Neat toy!,"Was a bit leary purchasing this product based on some reviews, but I'm glad I did. My boys LOVE this and it keeps them entertained for hours. The pieces snap together just fine and does not fall apart as easily as some reviews claim. My 4 year old constructed it in the house and carried his contraption down 3 steps into the garage without it falling apart. The connectors do need to be pushed together a bit tighter than a 4 yr old does, just check it before it's moved. As far as bugs getting out? Who'd want it in the house anyway? I teach my kids to release their ""pets"" when they're done playing. I also think that there are a perfect amount of tubes & connectors included, bugs are tiny, any more parts, it'd be way too big & too many pieces to lose or step on. I would recommend this toy, especially for a child who loves to build & connect things."
3,Neat but not enough pieces,"I bought this for my son and we both think it's a cool activity. The only problem is that there aren't enough connecting pieces in the set to use all of the tubes that come with it. This activity would be way better if it had twice as many main parts and enough connecting pieces to use them all. Also- I noticed that the connecting parts slip off pretty easily, so I can foresee bugs escaping in the future if someone bumps it or my youngest child gets at it. Those parts are also a choking hazard and if they slip off completely, that could be bad for my little one (I'll have to find a high place to store it). You'd think they'd have put some sort of locking snaps on them."
3,Crimebroker,"The movie was good, but the plot was not the best. The acting is good, but the production was fuzzy. It's a good movie, but there are others I would prefer to see, again, before I pick this."
2,Not up to par,"I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this CD the ""feel"" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket. It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one."
2,Get Some Rest Boys,"It could have been so much better. Watching the DVD, the band appears exhausted, and almost every song is sung flat. I was looking forward to this concert DVD, since their first live DVD/CD was great (it even aired on the CBC, but I hope this one does not). I have seen them live, and I can tell you that this DVD does not represent how great GBS can be onstage. If you get a chance to see them in concert, don't let the ""Courage & Patience & Grit"" performance keep you from going. I look forward to their future projects and shows, but this one should not have been released. I know that recording live is expensive, and timing it is diffucult, but they should have used a better performance."
4,"Arrr!! This be a hardy bit of the good stuff, matey!","Grab yer sword, pass the jar, stomp yer feet! If ye wurnt a pirate beforehand, ye will be after ye listen to these collecktion of tunes!"
2,Have bought much better,Brushes fell a part. VERY slow shipping. Would not purchase again.Their other brushes seem to be better constructed. Maybe next time I will try another type.
2,not a good book,"I think this book, In a scale from 1-10 is a 5. There wasn&#65533;t any major conflict in the story, and the worst thing the main character does is lose his stepfathers dog, and steel some cupcakes from a drugstore. The story is about a boy who&#65533;s parents have just divorced, so he&#65533;s having trouble in school. The main character, Joey, gets in fights with other school kids. His best friends are D. J.,(Not a good name on the authors part) and Denise. His only other troubles are his teacher Miss Hamlin, whom he hates. She is a new teacher and doesn&#65533;t have a clue about teaching. In total I think this book STINKS!!!!!"
1,Desperately Needs an Update,"Some good fitness advice and a humorous writing style are marred by too many homophobic remarks. After a while, her prejudiced comments made the book unreadable."
1,Didn't Work,"This product was advertised as working on XP but we could never get it to run. Needless to say my 6 year old was quite disappointed. Me too, cuz it looks fun."
2,The story that went up in smoke,"Holy cow. This is the second of the series of books with Martin Beck. This time he spends 2/3 of his time spinning wheels in Budapest with exactly one exciting moment and the rest quite dull and accomplishing nothing. Then he goes back home and figures out what happened in the most anti-climatic ending possible. I thought thiswas a waste of time, I'm back to Wallander."
3,Martin Beck in Budapest,"This is the second book in the Martin Beck series by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo. It's something of an oddity in that much of the book takes place in Budapest, rather than in Sweden where the rest of the series is set.Stockholm homicide detective Martin Beck is looking forward to beginning his long-awaited vacation, but only hours into it he's called back to investigate the disappearance of a Swedish journalist. Beck reluctantly agrees to take up the search which leads him to Budapest and finds him entangled with an international group of bad guys, one of whom is a nymphomaniac who sets her sights on Beck.This is a good read and Beck is a great protagonist. An excellent example of the police procedural."
3,congratulations,"congratulations on stumbling onto one of the best crime/satire series of the 20th century. If you didn't like this one, read some others, especially The Locked Room. Great writing with a moderate slant (they slam liberals and conservatives) makes this a wonderful series."
4,Book,"The book was new and was what I expected. The shipping was quite fast. Although I didn't like this story as much as ""The Laughing Policman"" by the same author (which I found at the library). Thanks."
4,The man who went up in smoke,"Highly readable, well thought out plot, Beck his usual glum self. I always enjoy reading the Beck stories he is so very Swedish."
3,One of their weaker efforts,"The third book in the Martin Beck detective series. This one focuses on the mysterious disappearance of a Swedish tabloid journalism in Eastern Europe. Beck is called off his August family holiday to investigate, but is secretly glad to get away from his overbearing wife.One of the weaker entries in the series. The story never really held my interest. However, I did appeciate the reverse intuition of the plot; though Beck gets involved with criminal underworld and international gun smugglers, things are ultimately much more simple than they first appear.If this one doesn't capture your interst, keep reading; the series steadily improves from here."
3,Stilll waiting...,"Still waiting for this series (and Martin Beck) to keep me interested in the plot and the character. This book, too, felt tedious and flat. Ho hum."
5,great book for internal med rotation,I would highly recommend this book! I felt like it prepared me well for the shelf along with mksap and pretest. It is not too wordy like Blueprints tends to be. Thorough but to the point. Definitely worth it!
4,Good high yield review,"Good high yield review, It lays out the basic knowledge base you should before encountering the problem in a clinical situation, but it by no means inclusive.I would recommend pacing your reading throughout the entire rotation, it is not a good text to use to cram/quick review before the Step/Shelf."
2,So-So... Best for Beginners,"I like the fact that the book is spiral bound, so you can keep it open while you are trying to duplicate a layout. However, 90% of the layouts in the book are very elementary. I was hoping for some more challenging, original ideas. There were a few good, original ideas here and there... but most layouts were things I have seen before. Some of the layouts didn't even look like they were worth publishing because they were so simple and plain and unattractive. I was rather disappointed with this book."
5,Wonderful Idea Book,"Great book. I liked the first book, and I think this book is even better! I like the products listed by each idea, and the different size ideas. It is the best idea book I have seen."
2,A Good Book For The Beginning Scrapbooker,"This is a good book if you are just starting to scrap or if you want basic, very simple ideas. The majority of the book seemed to be geared towards layouts that can be done in 30 minutes or less. There were a few layouts that seemed geared towards the more experienced scrapper, but in general I found the book to be a disappointment. I've been scrapbooking for 4 years and there wasn't much that I saw in this book that I haven't already seen before in either a Creative Memories idea book or one of scrapbook magazines. If you are a beginner than this book might help, otherwise I would say that you can find more interesting and challanging layouts in other publications."
2,Worked splendidly - for a while,"Lighting fixture worked as advertized, until after 6 months it started turning on and off on its own accord. Would like to have been able to disable the timing feature (so it would stay on unless switched off at wall) but could not figure out any way to do this.Is now essentially non-functional."
1,Why it's not available,"I called Lithonia to ask why this product was no longer available. They said that they no longer made it due to a ""patent issue"". I wish I knew what product has the original patent because this is just the type of fixture I'm looking for, for my porch."
3,TFBC,after 2 years of use the battery starts to loose power and doesn't go to full cycles of charge-discharge. No need to say time to chnge it.
2,Dies quickly.,"I bought the second battery to use on long trips, but this isn't a very good choice. I can't remember when I bought it (maybe a year ago?), but it's already dying. It only holds a charge for about 50 pictures before I have to charge it again. My original Cannon battery far outlasts this one. I recommend you get a name brand battery replacement."
2,Didn't work for me,"I had high hopes this would work. The design looked good, it was the correct size for the filter on my engine, the quality of the wrench is good, and other reviews were good. However it simply slipped around the filter and didn't get a grip no matter what I did. The filter was clean and dry. I ended up using a pair of channel locks to remove the filter which proved the filter was not over tightened as it came off easily.Perhaps it is just my fault it didn't work but I'm not a clutz. I'll likely toss it in the trash."
5,Horowitz in Moscow,"The CD, Horowitz in Moscow, was delivered on time, in perfect condition, and for a great price."
5,Bravo!,"This is my favorite CD in the whole wide world! I'm not an expert on the piano, but Horowitz's music has made me appreciate piano music much more than I did before. Get this CD if you haven't, it is a real treasure!"
3,intetesting book on beagle history,This book is 100 years old in the majority if it's content. Curious to see the issues of that day and how similar they were to those today.[...]
4,I love women,"I had been putting off this book for about 4 years and I finally read it. I was putting it off because I read the first chapter and it was dry. I have to tell you that it gets better down the road. Audre is not just talking about lesbianism, she is talking about being a woman and general. You can get good relationship advice by NOT following what she did in her relationships. I was exposed to lesbianism of 20-30 years ago in this book. It's so different now and for women (of all sexualities and colors) this book is for you.The only problem is that the beginning drags but once you are pass...let's say page 40 or the younger years you will be fine. Concerned, scared, hopeful...these are the things I felt for Audre. If you can't deal with the beginning put it down. However, I want you to know...one day I am sure you will pick it up again; or you should."
5,"View of history through black, lesbian eyes","I found this book very well-written and engaging in that it kept my attention. It brought up some historical aspects I had previously been unaware of, and a perspective on an era I had not encountered before. So it was enlightening and absorbing reading. I highly recommend it."
5,Peruvian Pleasure,"Finally, the Incas' leading position within Peruvian ""high culture"" is history. This compilation must be the foreseen return of the gods.However, if the track listing is correct, you ought to do your best to find the LP version of the masterpiece, where the astonishing number of 35 tracks are available for the immense masses of Peruvian undergound fans. As far as I can see on the list here, not only the slightly boring songs are cruelly torn away (for they do exist, yes, but not in annoying proportions), but even the jewel of global rock history; los Saicos' brutal ""Demolición"", where a liking of blowing up train stations is screamingly confessed (in spanish), plus the hilarious ""la Pitita"" by Snacks, and ""Te Amo"" by Los Silvertons. It must be a mistake, made either by Amazon.com or by the record company.Anyway, the 2LP version has all you need for a happy life, and it's distributed by vampisoul."
1,Not surprising,"I had not noticed previously that this author had capitalized on 9/11 to try to sell another book. I've only read the product description, but it's clear that the theme is: ""God is angry with America, therefore 9/11 occurred"". I wonder if the author does any backpedalling on his mid-90's assertions that God is so angry with the world that a major ""chastisement"" would occur prior to the turn of the millenium (year 2000). I am guessing he either ignored his previous claims, or cherry-picked scipture or other previous religious sources to explain why his claims might have been ""misconstrued"", and his new ones should be accepted with certainty. I'm sure it's a fairly lucrative business if you can con the community of believers."
5,Honk Tonk Lives,"Kevin never lets me down and his new cd Loose, Loud & Crazy is right on the money His song are stright to the point with no sappy, sweet or gooey lyrics. With this cd you get a good mix of Honky Tonkin, Drinking etc.The tounge in cheek humor of ""Don't Touch My Willie"" (as in Willie Nelson) should make you grin. Other cuts that shine are his duet with Mark Chesnutt who lends his vocals to ""Political Incorrectness"" To bad Nashville is more intrested just selling hugh numbers with their cookie cutters. Instead of an artist of this calaber."

1,Def jam fighting for new york,"I am Very disappointed with this game!!!!!I got a really bad copy! the game is a greated game but i bought a used copy and the sound was off, the story mode doesn't work.. i dont not trust the seller....i wasted my money when i could of bought one from game stop of something"
1,Def Jam Fight For NY Sucks,"This game sucks, only because the animation is choppy. The idea is great, the fighting styles are great, everythings great about this game accept the animation. This would be the best game, but for instance, they show a lot of video clips in between fights, or after fights or something, and there always choppy. So the pictures will freez, but the words will keep going, so the words wont match the characters. or sometimes the videoclips will just freez for like, 1 minute. Also sometimes the picture will keep going, but the words will stop. Also, keep in mind im playing this game on my new ps2, and the games brand new too. Also it happens with all my friends game also. So i am very dissapointed in the choppy animation. it makes the game not fun to play. So i think you should spend your $ on another game."
5,Best Fighter Ever!,"So much thought went into this game. It covers about everything and then some that you could ever expect out of a fighter. no matter what genre you are into you will have fun with this game. good story, great moves, awsome upgrades for you fighter not to mention the detail in which you can customize your fighter. just buy it, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"
4,One of da best,"Thiz is one of the best games of 2004.Is so original and we can have a lots of fun.Great collaborations of redman,snoop,xzibit,luda.The game iz just hot.I love that thang."
5,Not your grandmother's fighting game,"This game is super cool!!!! I started playing it and could not stop for 4 hours. There is a cool story mode and battle mode. There are fighters to unluck as well as venues. With the money earned you can buy new clothes, shoes, Jewelry, and hats. I recomend this game 100%. There are so many fighters and fighting styles to choose from. The coolest thing is that you get to create your own fighter when playing the story mode. If you are thinking of getting this game, think no more and get it. You will NOT be disappointed."
1,Fun at the! Beguning,"I got this nd played all the way thru until the end it wont let,me finish the game hopefully they send me a good one"
2,A sad testimony to Lenny's post 1970's decline,Absolutely disappointing compared to Lenny's 1960's Copland Symphony #3 recording on Columbia (now Sony). His 1960's Copland recordings are monumental. Avoid all his later Deutsches Gramophone dreck. These are only a sad testimony to Lenny's post 1970's decline. Used copies for sale for $1.79 should tell you something.Interesting album cover photo.
4,The Great and the Good,"Copland's 3rd Symphony contains some of the most beautiful music he ever wrote, but the sum of the work is not equal to its parts. The best movement is the first, particularly the breathtaking introduction. Here, Copland is in full 'Appalachian Spring' mode, writing in a style that now seems so quintessentially American that it is easy to forget that he virtually invented it. But after this movement, I don't feel as if I'm listening to a symphony any more and the growing lack of cohesion between the ideas isn't helped by the intrusion of the 'Fanfare for the Common Man' in the finale.But despite it's qualified success as a symphony, this is still a very rewarding work and the other piece, 'Quiet City', is hauntingly beautiful."
3,Price??,"What is going on here - $17+ for the CD and another $18 ""sourcing"" fee???And for only two of the sonatas, when there is plenty of room on a CD for all three?? And the music industry complains about losing money...It's too bad, since these are interesting performances, if a bit over the top for my taste. But there's plenty of excitement here, and excellent sound. Maybe the price is incorrect...?"
1,Bad Design,"Ist, I had no idea you had to put these together. There were no tips on how to squeeze the wire thru the tiny boot and on a right angle. The grease they provided was no help.TIP: I used dish washing liquid to lube the wire and needle nose pliers to ull it thru the boot.The connector end you crimp on is not secure at all and comes off. It wiill come off when you take off the wire.Very very bad design"
2,Stiff Fabric,"The fabric of the bandanna is very stiff, making it stick up on your head when you tie it. This bandanna is more suited for people who wear bandannas as scarves. Some of the stiffness is mitigated by serial washings."
3,Authentic,"This bag is authentic, however the quality that you would expect from Fendi just isn't there. I left it in the sun, and the fabric faded!!!! Before that, the bag recieved a lot of compliments."
3,Nice Compilation,"It is a very good compilation of short stories about ghosts and hauntings. The book was well written and very well organized. One thing that i didn't like about the book is that, almost all stories came from another century and some stories were doubtful."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to the same version I purchased at my local Wal Mart, these sweat pants did not measure up in the fit, comfort, or price departments. I do not recoommend them. All four pairs will likely be taken to Good Will...."
5,pockets!,"Good sweats, like the pockets. The pant legs taper down very nicely. I do not like the workout pants with floppy pant legs, it is irritating to me."
3,Jerzees Sweatpant,The pants don't fit properly in the seat. Everytime my husband bends over the pants pull down. Seems like they were manufactured backwards. Wouldn't buy again.
3,Too big.,these pants were too big and weren't soft in texture. I like them soft.Don't have anything else to say.....
1,Not sized right,The pants I purchased were 3X and labled 3X. When the waist was stretched out it was 48 inches. I have only a 30 inch inseam but the legs were short. On the package slip there is no return information and no way to contact the seller. Definatly not comfortable pants to lounge in.
1,Wear clean shorts under these !!!!,"I bought two pair of these... Yesterday, as I bent to tighten toilet seat bolts.... THEY RIPPED OPEN at the crotch... Today, I wore the second pair, and as I bent down to pick up a garden hose, this pair ALSO RIPPED WIDE OPEN at the crotch !!! First time worn both days... This has happened twice to very old sweats AFTER they were worn, beat and washed and dried hundreds of times !!! If you do buy these cheaply sewn sweats, make SURE you are wearing clean underwear beneath them !!!I'm sure my two pair were not the usual.... Either the thread was bad, or the seams at the crotch area were just sewn too close to the edge of the fabric.. Since i have OLDER pairs of Jerzees sweats and they never split open, I'm sure most pair will hold up for long wear....Bottom line,.. These sweats should NOT have split open on me.. I was NOT doing anything that unusual. And it was the FRONT that split ! (I'm not that well endowed either) Lol.."
2,Pockets,"No pockets as advertised for these sweatpants, which is one of the things I wanted in my order. Otherwise they are what I expected."
2,"Nice feel, poor fit","I was disappointed in the fit of these sweats after washing. They shrink at least one half size so buying a size larger didn't help. The fit is below waistline especially during exercise, and the inseam is shorter than expected for the size. The pockets are the best feature; I would not recommend these pants and will not buy them again."
1,Do not waste your time and money,These are tight around the ankle and uncomfortable- returns are not friendly and restocking fees are applied. Not the customer service I am used to shopping on amazon.com
1,Cheap Drawstring,"Bought 2pr. in early '10. Drawstring on each pair broke before having them for a month. The pants are comfortable, but useless for me without the waist support. For pennies Jerzee could've made a better product. Customer, beware!"
1,TINY plastic robot,"I ordered some of these for children only to discover they're not suitable for the children I intended. These are tiny plastic wind-up toys about the quality of Happy Meal toys, but not safe for small children. I am kicking myself for being fooled by pictures, again. I'm keeping them for adult stocking stuffers, for a couple of friends who love robots - not their young children. Kids will enjoy watching, but these aren't sturdy enough to withstand rough treatment."
1,It's just the NTSB report for this accident,"The book is just a reprint of the official NTSB Accident Report. If you have that report (which is free for downloading), you don't need this book."
4,WOW!,"WOW! All I can say is WOW! This is a great book. Trust me, get yours now. This writer is going to go places. Wonderful allegorical fiction... very ""C.S. Lewis"", though lighter on the fantasy. Includes wonderful selections of poetry from the author's earlier books."
5,Giro Nine Helmet,"I recently purchased a Giro Nine helmet from Amazon.com. They gave me an option to have free shipping as long as I did not mind waiting 7-14 days. I picked that option and actually received my helmet in only 3 days!!!!The product itself is great. The helmet is comfortable and light. The strap is padded so it does not rub against your chin. The helmet keeps you very warm. There is no ventilation like some other helmets, but that is fine for me (I am always cold, not hot).I have not had any major wipe outs yet, so I cannot comment on that aspect of the quality. The pink, smog, and white color is cute; but it can easily get scratched. I store my helmet in a small case to protect it while traveling."
4,Great brain bucket,"I have 2 of these helmets now. The first one I purchased, I was able to add the Skul Candy earphones with ipod connector (love that set up). Unfortunately I left the first helmet at our 2nd home in Bend, OR. As our primary residence is in Dallas, TX and I sometimes take ski trips to CO or UT, I ended up picking up a second helmet (cause I like the first one). It works ok with regular ipod headphones but I will keep looking for an option like the skul candy I have in the first"
4,real size is smaller than described,"I read one customer review mentioning that the size is smaller than it describes and I did not believe it. So I measured 3 times and made the order. When it arrives, it is nice product however it is so tight on my son's head. So I lost $10 shipping fee from the refund. I will order items with free shipping only for size-sensitive products."
5,Looked like it would not work but it does,"Even though my Nokida model, 6126, was listed as working when this arrived I thought oh-man they shipped the wrong thing. Then I looked at the model number on the cable and it was the one I ordered. Then I thought oh man I ordered the wrong thing.Turns out it works even though all the connections do not seem to match, it is secure, and actually have a very high transfer rate. So if you get it out and it doesn't seem like it would fit, play with it until it snaps in and it probably will work for you if your model is listed."
4,Outstanding Product,This product is excellent. It allows me to take full control of my cell phone and to be able to customize all features.
3,Technical difficulties,"Its works ok, but for some reason when I would connect it to my computer from my phone,on the monitor it would say connected..then a few seconds later disconnected, and switch back and forth and I never even touched it!"
1,Made in China,"China is Still a commie country.Buy Made In USA,the job you save may be Your own.It has been miss labeled on thesite."
3,You get what you pay for,Great for still shots but almost totally unusable for any motion. Blurs even the slowest motion. Software installation was fairly time consuming but straight forward.Cam was $9.99 plus $5.74 shipping
1,"JUNK JUNK JUNK , unacceptably S-L-O-W","Easy setup, but who cares, when the end result is a very slow video. Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie ""The Mask"". When he whips his head from side to side and you see the ""blur"", THAT'S what you see with this webcam! Don't waste your money. I'm sending it back tomorrow!"
2,Incomplete Online Description by Ezonics Made Return Necessary,"This negative review is NOT for the webcam itself -- whose quality I was unable to judge due to its incompatibility with my Windows 7 system. And it is NOT for the seller -- who courteously issued me a full refund upon receiving the returned item from me. It is for the manufacturer, Ezonics, who failed to include system compatibility information in its Amazon description of the item (and, at the date of this review, *still* has not added that information). Had such information been included, I would've known that this webcam is incompatible with Windows 7 and would not have purchased it in the first place, thus avoiding the necessity of shipping it back to the seller. Lesson learned: NEVER purchase an electronics item that doesn't indicate system compatibility in its description."
4,Just Fine,"This was my first webcam, and I thought it was nice. It'll freeze every great once in awhile, but usually ill just shut it off for a sec and then it's fine. It's not bad for $20, and the picture quality isn't bad either. It's not amazing, but it's a good value for the price."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I was rather disappointed in this product, seeing as I'm crazy about their vitamin E skin care cream that comes in the tub. I knew I needed something with SPF so I went for this. I think this might have broken me out. It's always hard to pinpoint what's exactly the cause of your breakouts, but this definitely didn't do anything GOOD for my skin. My skin only improved when I stopped using it. I really wanted to love this and I don't know what I'll do with the rest of it. Also, I would not recommend this for very sensitive skin; I could see it burning. If I get even the smallest amount in my eye (such as from rubbing it later in the day) it burns like crazy.Why can't they just take our trusty Vitamin E Skin Care Cream and add some SPF into it? This is a very different recipe altogether."
4,Smok'n fun!,"I bought one of these from our local Toys r Us and opened it up right away. the #1 feature that might have hindered me from purchasing this is the fact that it takes 6 AA batteries to run, but I think it was worth it. The bubbles can be blown regularly or filled with smoke with some of the liquid smoke and a flick of a switch. It was really neat to watch the bubbles pop with some strange smoky effects. It is comprable to the VAPO-Blaster. The only thing is that the kids got a bit messy with the dipping of the wand in the solution... This is a neat toy! I saw it in Japan, but I'm glad I got to buy one in the states."
3,confusing names,"I believe this is referring to the Bang!Bang!Bakansu! single and contains 2 completely new songs not on the Sample Bang album, despite the similar names. Considering the fact that I didn't care for a number of the songs on the Sample Bang album I can't help but wonder why they didn't replace some of those lackluster songs with these two much catchier ones. Bang!Bang!Bakansu! is an upbeat, jokey song and Yashii Kotoba is a med-slow groove song. Not smap's best but I wasn't disappointed that I had bought the single."
3,So-So CD,"I ordered this CD for my mom thinking that it was another one. I confused it with the ""All the Best from Germany: 20 Hits"" (the one with a picture of the ""Disney"" Castle on it), and was disappointed when I listened to this one. The CD with the 20 hits in the song title is superior to this one because it doesn't have all the background noises that some of the tracks on this one has. But it was still an OK (just OK) CD."
4,Fine Verdi Orchestral Music Courtesy of Karajan and the BPO,"Fans of Giuseppe Verdi's operatic orchestral music should rejoice in this fine two CD collection assembled from Karajan's 1970's recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Karajan leads the Berliners in warm, vibrant performances of Verdi's famous and lesser known orchestral overtures and preludes. The sound quality is fine, thanks to Deutsche Grammophon's state of the art 24 bit digital remastering."
5,Very nice!,"I ordered this charm for my Twilight bracelet. While the description says ""cougar"" I thought it would be a nice representation of a Mountain Lion which is, as we all know, Edward Cullen's favorite vegetarian vampire meal (spoiler alert) and Bella's first vampire meal. The sizing is perfect with all of the charms I ordered from ""Runs with Vampires"". This is a lovely addition to my Twilight charm bracelet."
5,Schoenberg's Short Masterpieces,"I am astonished by the review that gave this only 1 star. Schoenberg, even though he never played the piano, wrote masterfully for the instrument. These pieces advance piano literature by light-years, and one should not be prejudiced against them because none of them are written in his early post-Wagnerian manner. My advice: listen to each piece for 5 times consecutively. Then you will behold the poignant expressionism that many of the pieces convey. Great Works of Music. A Must for anyone interested in 20th Century Music."
4,pay no attention to the new yorker,"the music fan from ny, ny is just being obnoxious. (well, if you don't like modernism or dissonance, you'll probably agree with him, but still--i mean, i wouldn't exactly call strauss an authority on musical taste) some of these, especially opp. 19 and 25, are really great pieces. pollini's performance strikes me as a bit cold, though; i actually like gould's recordings of these pieces, inaccurate though they may be. (his playing of the gigue from op. 25 on the soundtrack to ""32 short films"", although completely wrong in terms of tempo, is some of the most exciting schoenberg i've heard outside of ""pierrot lunaire"")"
3,response to mr. hurwitz,"Mr. Hurwitz was wrong about Glenn Gould being the first great pianist to record all the Schoenberg piano music. Edward Steuermann holds that honor. His traversal was captured on a Columbia Masterworks LP (ML5216). Steuermann was Schoenberg's pupil, and his complete Schoenberg piano music LP is top notch (available used on Amazon when I last looked--but you will need a phonograph). My favorite CD of this music is Paul Jacobs'. It's unmannered, yet deeply interpreted--no small feat. Steuermann rivals Jacobs. He turns in an equally committed performance, which is a little lighter than what Jacobs offers, which in Schoenberg is a good thing, since Schoenberg himself questioned whether everything he composed turned to stone. Pollini and Uchida are less brilliant."
4,I am very glad to have this recording,"It seems odd that Schoenberg's music should still upset people after nearly a century! Heavens, listening to any movie music or popular music nowadays will contain noise much more dissonant than anything that Schoenberg and his circle every did but will lack any of its charm or genius.These piano works are an important part of the repertoire. Each of us will prefer this or that work, I suppose. But they had such tremendous influence that it is hard to even think about them in terms of like or prefer. They just are.Pollini, of course, has the technique to do anything. Sometimes I feel that his technique is a substitute for poetry and wit, but I hate to criticize such an important artist. Believe me, you could do a lot worse than this disk. If you know of better recordings I would be happy to hear about them, please email me with the information."
1,"""Compositional Problems""","The below reviewer writes of ""compositional problems."" Indeed, the problem is that Schoenberg bothered to compose at all after around 1909. As R. Strauss so aptly stated: ""Poor Schoenberg would do better to shovel snow than to scribble on music paper now."" The farts contained on this CD are noisy enough, but as rotten smelling as any silent-but-deadly emission. As Schoenberg's paintings were stinky enough, would that Schoenberg had made no noise but rather released his stench in silence."
4,obamas war,"i really bought this after seeing the special on the internet, because this was filmed with my son's Marine unit- right where he was at. although, we never see him in the documentary, it is something i wanted to have to show his kids someday, of what an important job the Marines did in the summer of 2009. i thought the documentary was put together exceptionally well,the reporters just did a superb job of honest reporting- i only wished they would have shown a little more footage from the field; but it still was just an incredible documentary. this is a big piece of history, and definitely worth seeing/owning."
3,Good band............,"..but I'm not sure about the singer. I took the previous reviewer's advice and picked up this CD but I was disappointed. The band is hot and the tunes are good but Josie's voice lacks a range and passion for rockabilly. Maybe they could turn her voice up on the recording. Anyway, buyer beware, five stars this aint."
2,Rockabilly duck,"Dear God! I picked this up because I always like to check out female rockabilly singers, and admittedly, the cover is quite intriguing. But, yecch! I'm sure Josie's probably a really nice person, but her pathetic attempts to sound like Wanda Jackson end up sounding like, well, a duck. The songs are well-written, and the band is good, but Kreuzer's voice is just plain horrible--nasal, lacking feeling, and ducklike. Go buy some Wanda Jackson, Charline Arthur, Rosie Flores, or Marti Brom instead--get a real voice minus the eye candy!"
2,"Disjointed, Poorly Written, Useless Info","I have no idea what the folks who highly rated this book were reading/thinking. This is not a good book about the 1906 SF earthquake. All over the map with useless info, particularly the post-earthquake SF government graft trials. This last info was pointless, long, boring and was never tied in by the author to either the 1906 earthquake or the direction of SF government since then. Stilted writing. Not an enjoyable read."
3,Good Performance,"A very good performance and an excellent recording. A very lush, lyrical, and passionate reading. Although the orchestra plays very well, sometimes precision and control give way to exorbitant fits of passion. Some may prefer their Brahms a bit drier and more crisp. It's a bit pricey for a disc with only one piece on it. I'd buy it again, but only if it were on sale."
1,Brutal as only Kararjan knows to be,"Karajan never gives you a good surprise: His performances are always bright, but brutal and arrogant. The same is with this wonderful symphony, which Karajan strives to destroy.The opening theme is supposed to create tension, but Karajan only creates fear, with the tribe-drums banging. In the second and 3rd movements the orchestra sounds sharp and well-polished, but Karajan fails to catch the lyrical touch of the 2nd and the danceful temper of the 3rd. He even misses the famous horns in the 4th mvt., again - for lack of sensitivity. He ends up with a violent coda, where he triumphanty crushes you under his boots. As soon as you recover, you'll run back to Solti, Szell, Kertesz or Levine."
3,"Fine lotion, I don't know about firming",The only way you can really firm your skin is to get your butt off the couch and exercise. No amount of firming lotion will change your skin in a dramatic way. It is a good moisurizer though.
5,It really works!,"I am pleasantly surprised! An awesome product for the price.I've been disappointed by so many products' claims that I didn't have any great expectations when I bought the lotion. I've had some cellulite on my thighs since I was in my early 20s, and I thought that this lotion might make a subtle difference. And for the price I paid, it was worth taking the chance. I figured it'd be a good moisturizer even if it did nothing for cellulite.So I started applying the lotion once or twice daily. It has a clean, light scent, and it moisturizes well. Like other Jergens lotions, it's thin and not greasy.I'd only been using the product for about a week when I noticed a VERY obvious improvement. My skin looked smoother and more even. Now that I've been using it for a little over a month, I'm very pleased with the continued smoothing/firming effects.I've since switched to a store brand, and I've maintained my results. Very satisfied!"
2,2 stars because of the quality....,"Other than that, it is very ugly in person. I will be returning this comforter. Try some of the other colors, you will not be disappointed."
2,Ok but not great,Not so sure I really like this course so much because it seems pretty out of touch for a course on colloquial language. It could use a bit of sprucing up in my opinion.
2,Fun but poor quality,"Received this a a gift for my 6 and 10 y.o. They use it frequently. I built a platform for safe launches. Capacity says 250lbs, so I tried it (Dad, 200lbs) and one of the metal turnbuckle stripped it's threads, landing me on my kiester. I bought a better capacity unit at hardware store. Note for Dads to stay off.After about a year, the cable chewed through one of the pulleys. I'm trying to source a new one. The kids like it, but the hardware should be better quality."
2,Fun - yes. Durable - NO!,"Purchased Feb. 9, 2012.Installed Feb. 25, 2012.Load rating up to 250 lbs.Average use on weekends by kids less than 75 lbs.Trolley inoperable - April 28, 2012.During the average course of a ride the rider will swing left and right. Because the trolley is made of plastic, the metal cord will rub/wear the trolley. This will eventually create wear that the trolley isn't designed to withstand. Our rear wheel became so deformed that it wouldn't spin, but the rider could still descend on 3 wheels. This further deformed the rear wheel and created ill wear on the remaining 3 wheels - till it just wouldn't slide.I think if the trolley had somesort of metal guides for the cablepath it would have lasted longer.I just expected more."
1,cheap flimzy..you buy a 1/4 inch wire heavy duty at home depot..could not hold my 110 poud sons weight,flimsy and cheap home depot has heavy duty 1/4 wire ..could not hold sons weight 110 Lbs.. Bought wire at home depot and clamps way lot safer then this cheap thing.. wire 100 ft at home depot 1/4 $35
1,Spring Swings Super Z Fun Ride,"I purchased this Zipline and installed it based on the directions included with the packaging. On the third ride the line slipped out of the bolts and my 15 year old son dropped 12 feet on his chest and head. He is ok, however when I decided to put the line back up I went to HomeDepot to get new parts. What I found was that the U bolts included in the package were not recommended for the size of wire rope included in the package. I bought 100 feet of new wire rope, new U bolts based on the size recommended for the wire rope and saved nearly $100 on the materials. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Poor Quality,"I installed the line in the back yard, and it was used by kids and some adults that weighed less than the rated load capacity. I include that information to let you know that we didn't abuse the product or stress it past what it was supposed to be able to handle according to the manual. Within 3 months of use, one of the cheap plastic wheels in the trolley had failed and the trolly wouldn't run to the end of the line anymore. If you are in the market for a zip line, find a kit with metal wheels. A better trolley may cost 50 dollars more, but having the zip line work for an entire season is worth it."
3,complete set but needs upgrades,"we bought this for our active seven year old. it was easy to set up and assemble, but as other reviewers have stated, the trolley is a bit cheap with plastic wheels. i am assuming it wont last long never mind it does not glide very well. at this moment i am looking for a replacement trolly with metal wheels and ball bearings."
1,"Garbage product - low quality, high injury risk","This product should not be on the market. Based on the assembly directions and product quality, this is not a product that should be approved for children. I would strongly recommend against purchasing. We have returned ours after hours of attempted assembly and eventually realizing the quality / injury risk thru testing. If you are thinking of purchasing, run, don't walk to another product"
1,Watch out,I purchased this set two months ago and didn't find the time to install it until last weekend.The main roller is made put of cheap plastic which was suspicious since it carries all the load. I also notices that even after tightening the bolts it wasn't perfect.Despite the above I was able to assemble the kit. My 6 years old tried it twice and my concerns became reality. The main blue plastic was cracked...I am looking for a way to return the set and get a safer one.
5,Great Birthday Present,"We bought this for our daughter's birthday. It was very easy to install and she loves it. If fact, she wants us to buy another one."
2,Should have believed the reviews,"I'd like to apologize for doubting all the people who tried to warn us about the quality of this product. As others have noted, the instructions are lacking, customer service is poor and most importantly, the trolley is doomed to fail regardless of the rated weight limits. My 11 year old daughter and her friends used this for 3 days before the plastic rollers wore out. I will say that when working my children loved this item. If you choose to purchase this item be prepared to replace the rollers (available at hardware stores) and please inspect often to prevent a serious injury."
2,Broken on First Day,"It took some careful analysis to decipher the instructions but once we knew what we were doing, installation wasn't that bad. Just don't try to do this while your kids are anxious to start zipping!Unfortunately, the trolley only lasted about 15 rounds and now doesn't glide but rather stutters down the line. The final straw was an attempt by my husband to use the line after being begged by the kiddo. He is well below the reported 250 limit!No amount of adjustment has resolved the problem. So now I feel like I paid $144 for a piece of cable. :("
2,Only for small trees and broken hardware,"The first problem I ran into installing this unit was that the cable sling is only long enough to rap around 7"" diameter tree. The second problem I had was that one nuts on one of the turnbuckles was stripped."
2,cheap,"Cheaply made product. I certainly wouldnt put a 250 pound person on this. After 3 days of use, the plastic on the pulley is fraying, and so far everyone that has used it has been under 120 pounds. Also,we had to buy a winch, ($40.00) to keep it tightened. NOT WORTH THE MONEY..."
5,A winner,"This book is bright, vivid, eye-catching, and fun. Our 20-month old is very interested in counting and animals so this book perfectly fits both categories. This is the book that she wants us to read to her, oh, about 20 times a day. She has now begun to ""read"" it to herself and her stuffed animals throughout the day. We highly recommend this book for younger children (because of the bright and interesting illustrations) as well as older ones (the simplicity of the illustrations makes it easy to actually count the animals pictured)."
1,What a shame.,NASCAR FANS SAVE YOUR MONEY! This as well as others i've bought from nascar super store are almost un-watchable. It's almost like some kid with a 8mm camera filmed these races. These are not what was televised. Had any TV station aired these NASCAR would never be where it is today. The cars are white and black most of the time they are on screen. They are just silhouettes from the sun glare. I have been watching NASCAR since 1984 and I know personally this is not what was televised. Even some of the newer races look this bad. How could NASCAR get the money to grow as they did if fans couldn't see the fancy color schemes or even the number on the cars. And the sound is also equally as bad. I can't suggest strongly enough how much of a waste these tapes are.
4,Emotional Intelligence & Leadership,Very interesting. Connects the dots between all of the parts of emotional intelligence and leadership. Each chapter has a one-page story that illustrates a leader applying the competency. You can tell the authors are executive coaches and not academic types.
5,Brilliant!,"Angry melding of Costello, Replacements, Beatles and Big Star make this a true winner. It's bitter but a good pill to swallow. Salim deserves to be the next rock god!"
2,embellishment,"While many facts in this book are true, the author often embellished, and took the phrase, ""poetic license"" to a new level. I know,because I was there during the same period, and served with charlie battery, and 3/3 marines. Would not recommend this book to anyoneseeking the truth about vietnam."
1,I was horrified and disgusted by this book.,"Maybe I didn't read the same book as everyone else, who only comment on the heroine being raped by her lover. She is also forced to have sex with a man she despises to save her lover and is then gang raped. If that's your kind of thing, then you will love this book, but I imagine most people read and hear enough about rape in the news not to feel inclined to pay for it."
5,A classic of the genre,One of the first and best romance novels I ever read. Few writers today can depict the remarkable intensity between the lovers as this author can. Their story lingers with the reader long after the novel ends.
2,Not much of a romance,"Wow totally not what I was expecting. I know as a romance fan I was meant to love this, but I had difficulty finishing it. sPOILER The hero rapes the heroine, the heroine is beaten and raped by other people and the hero doesn't care. I guess it's meant to be powerful, but it wasn't for me. No, not what I was expecting."
2,Sweet and Sour Lust Is More Like It,"You know, I actually had to keep a written tally on who was sleeping with whom. I didn't know French women came with red hair and green eyes. That sounded an Irish cliche to me. Well, read it if you want. If you're THAT bored, maybe you want to look into clipping your toenails"
4,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL,"THIS WAS THE FIRST NOVEL OF IT'S KIND THAT I READ, ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A TEEN, I HAVE KEPT IT (THE WHOLE SERIES)ON MY BOOKSHELVES EVER SINCE! I HAVE READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS POSTED HERE AND I AGREE SOME OF THE STORY IS ""SAVAGE""(HENCE THE TITLE)...IF YOU WANT BUTTERFLIES & FLOWERS LOOK ELSEWHERE,THIS IS DOWN & DIRTY, NEEDFUL & NASTY, SWEET & SAVAGE AND YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS LOVE"
1,Any Spinal Tap Fans out there?,Here goes my review of this um book... shark sandwich... $hit sandwich. That's about it.
3,"A different kind of ""romance"" novel","Like a lot of readers who've read this book, I also think the title is misleading. Perhaps this is the reason that I was taken aback by some of the more lurid plot. This would've been a better book if the author had spared Steve and Ginny, not to mention the readers, just a few of the numerous ghastly events that befall them. It's similar to what soap opera characters go through. So, if you enjoy watching soap operas and are not squeamish, then you would find this book ""a juicy good read."" One thing to be said for the book is that it leaves a strong impression, for better or for worse. After finishing this one, I couldn't wait to read the two sequels mainly because I had a morbid curiosity to see what other tortures the author would inflict upon Steve and Ginny. I was not disappointed! In conclusion, I think the book is certainly ""savage"" enough, but there is barely any ""love""."
5,I love this book!,I read this book about thirty years ago and loved it. During moving I got rid of all my books and now regret it. I am going to buy this book and all the wonderful books that Rosemary Rogers wrote in the past. She is one of the best! Thanks Rosemary!
4,Great Read,"At first I thought I wouldn't like it, but as I got into the story I couldn't put it down. I became so involved with the characters. At times I liked Ginny and other times I could have slapped her. Sometimes I felt the 2 main characters were destine never to be together. They went through some terrible stuff. The book is well worth the read."
2,The perfect couple.,"Sweet Savage Love has all the twisted appeal of one of those R. L. Stein novels for teenagers. The heroine, Virginia Brandon, is such a bubble-headed tease that you want to slap her silly, the way the hero frequently does, which may be why you keep turning the pages. The hero, Steve Morgan, has the morals of an alley cat and little else to recommend him. His one redeeming quality is that he hates Virginia almost as much as you do. Each of them singly is mind-numbingly stupid, and the two of them together are positively Martian. The only sensible thing either one of them does is eat, drink, or sleep -- and even then, they usually screw it up. I think what I love best about this book is that end up married, and never did any couple deserve each other more."

1,"It's not sweet, nor is it love.","Two words : rape myths. I didn't expect a classic, but this was pure rot. Steve, the ""hero"", is lucky he existed a long time ago; in this day and age he'd get a life sentence. Of course, Ginny the ninny would probably send him care packages in jail - women love the men who rape them, according to Ms. Rogers"
1,don't spend your money,"Read it if you can find it at the public library, otherwise, don't waste your money. I borrowed this one from a friend and remembered why I don't read this author. I like to read ROMANCE. That indicates that the main characters fall in love. Maybe not at first, but at some point. For this author the hero and heroine don't have any reason to like each other (and don't!) until the end. Then all of a sudden they have been in love the whole time. Ghee, I wonder where men got the idea that every womans fantasy is to be raped?And don't give me any of that ""she paved the way for other authors"" I was reading romance in the 70's and there is only, maybe, one other writer who puts her characters through such a torturous, unrealistic plots. There were plenty of other writers putting out very steamy *love* stories that you wanted to read over and over. This author is in a class all her own and she can have it."
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"The book description does not aptly describe the entire book. It describes the last 20 or pages. While I thought the story would be about what happens after Kate's stepfather died and Ethan's divorce, it was not to be. Almost the entire story, was about events leading up to that. Not very exciting events I might add. The character were poorly developed and while a lack of communication and misunderstandings might leading to an interesting story, this one did not. Until the very end of the book Kate and Ethan were also jumping to the wrong conclusion. Frankly I don't see how they even got together. Skip this book!"
3,"Dvorak Good, Sibelius Boring","Shlomo Mintz's recordings are usually great, but this pairing of the Dvorak and Sibelius is semi-disappointing. The Sibelius is competent but in a word, it sounds very pinched. Except for the first movement second cadenza, Mintz's usually large, sweet tone is nowhere to be found. Many passages are glossed over and unsavored, particularly in the second and third movements. This concerto is all about abandonment and passion, of which Mintz displays precious little. The Dvorak is better, and there are some pleasing moments. But as in the Sibelius, he makes some some odd choices musically - in particularly, the phrasing in the third movement. The phrasing of the main theme (in the solo part) has to match what the orchestra violins are doing, otherwise it sounds laughably bad.If you want better recordings - for the Sibelius, I'd recommend Cho-Liang Lin or Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg. For the Dvorak, Milstein or Stern."
1,terrible,"i work in the sheet metal industry and wiss snips are known as junk. im constantly tightening the bolts on them to get them to cut right. the blade likes to loosen and turn sideways instead of cutting through the metal and ive only had them for 6 months. they might be okay for harry homeowner, but not for use everyday. if you work in sheet metal dont get wiss snips, they dont last."
2,Flimsier than similar racks,"Compared to similar racks we already own (we have a clothing business) this is far flimsier and less stable due to its greater height. The tubular metal is lighter gauge than true commercial units, and you can easily deform it when tightening the nuts that hold the casters in place. I think the claim that it holds ""well over 200 lbs."" is dubious; it seems in danger of capsizing with half that weight on board."
2,OK for light home use but not heavy duty use.,"We purchased two of these racks to use at our charity rummage sales. Unfortunately, they were not as sturdy and durable as they claimed to be. We barely had 100 lbs of clothes on the racks and one of them broke during the first use. One of the bars broke off completely. We were very disappointed in this purchase."
1,Absolute Junk!!!,"Don't waste your time or your money on this flimsy, unstable and highly likely to collapse Garment Rack. The description says it will hold 250 pounds... mine twisted and collapsed under less than 100 pounds of clothing. It didn't last 15 minutes. Do not buy this Junk. Worst performing item I've ever purchased on Amazon.com"
4,Accepting transparency,This was a good book connecting communication facilitated by the internet to the concept of organizational health. In a nutshell the internet can hurt or help an organization depending on its attitude about transparency. You can't fool all of the people all of the time.
5,Offering Hope and Brilliance,"Only a few of the 650,000 people in the Dean campaignwould deny that Joe Trippi worked his heart out forall of us -- not for his own self-promotion.His brilliance and risk-taking propelled a ragtagband into a real loving community. Now, since thecandidate's loss in his bid for the presidency,some are bitter, but Joe's book is not.His rich story telling and analogies -- the Dean campaignas a little league baseball team on the field with theNew York Yankees -- are inspiring and hopeful. He tellsall who were involved in our campaign that they really didperform like the Miracle Mets.His link back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison,and his look forward toward the promise of communityempowerment is just what the doctor ordered for anyAmerican, cynical, disgusted and disillusioned. Give thisbook to your friends, families and coworkers. And youwill be giving them a reason to believe in democracyagain."
5,Pleased,"Had bought a similar produce from a diferent vender; it was clearly inadequate for the job. Am very pleased with this product. It fits well, doesnt leak air and is well built. price is also very good for the quality"
3,Low quality solution for a useful function,"The unit is full of leaks that need to be plugged with the same type of aluminum foil tape that should be used on the round duct-work. But it's much easier to seal the joints of the round ducts than it is to seal this product. Also, in my case at least, it would worked better if it had extended two inches further. Yet the product does serve a very useful purpose in some installations, if you have the time and the patience.It should be more feasible to make a quality product out of some type of plastic than from this lightweight aluminum, if you can find such a thing.It appears that this product is marketed under many different labels. Anything that looks like this one is very probably made by the same manufacturer with the same quality standards, regardless of the price. My comments would apply to all of them."
3,Vent review,Dryer vent came in extremely bent! Since we were in desperate need we bent it back out and fixed it.
4,"great for Blackberry Pearl 8100, not for Sprint 8130","Speck always has great hard cases for the Blackberry line of phones. I bought a case for my work phone Bberry Curve (ATT) and was very happy with the case, especially the full-coverage screen protection. So, when I got my Bberry Pearl for my personal phone, I immediately bought the Speck clear, smoke colored hard case for the Pearl. As soon as I opened the package I realized that I should've double-shecked the pictures as the hard case would not work with the Sprint version of the Pearl 8130(Pearl2). The problem is that the Speck case does not have the proper openings on the side for the Pearl2, blocking the microSD slot and soft buttons(voice dialing-L, camera-R) on each side. Otherwise the case fit perfectly and without any hassle putting it on.When Speck makes a Sprint Pearl2 version, I will buy one. For right now, I've got another brand."
2,"I see where this was going, but it didn't make it there","I had high hopes for this album after seeing it reviewed well in a magazine. However, I'm disappointed in it. I don't feel the songs were 'tuned up'; there are too many places where I feel let down by sections that feel rushed. Do note that I generally don't take my politics through music. I'm only here to be entertained. This was was a detractor for me as well."
3,ok,"The piano playing is excellent. The soloists and singers are actually good. But compared with the Pokrovsky Ensemble recording, one can tell a lot of edge and musical effects have been lost simply from not being comfortable with Russian. Also the Pokrovsky recording uses a smaller choir which gives it a more transparent and agile sound. Bernstein's recording is definitely not the final word on Les Noces but it is a good one."
4,Good but definitely NOT the best,"I don't agree with the previous reviewer. Though Bernstein's version of ""Les Noces"" is certainly more exciting than his comatose version of ""Symphony of Psalms,"" it is certainly NOT the best version available. Stravinsky's own version is the best, but unfortunately that's only available in the boxed set costing... The next best one I've heard is the 1992 version by Robert Craft on ""Stravinsky the Composer"" volume II. Buy the Bernstein version only if you want your Stravinsky with all the rough edges softened and the rhythmic vitality watered down."
2,Probably good for eventers,I didn't find this book over helpful. I ride hunter/ jumpers and felt it wad pretty directed at eventers.
4,Highly Recommended,"I highly respect Pippa Funnel, and this book is just wonderful. I have a young horse that I'm schooling and it helped me to understand just how important the basics are for a young horse, and how to go about introducing them to certain things. I especially found the jumping section very helpful. This book has big, glossy colour pictures throughout, and very easy to understand instructions which explain how to go about each new schooling exercise. It also shows what not to do, which is why I gave this book 4 stars and not 3. Showing what's wrong and the outcome of what could happen if approached wrong really sold this book to me, because there are many books out there which tell you what to do, but not how to recover when anything goes wrong."
1,Pretty Pictures,"There are a lot of pretty pictures in this book, with the occassional good piece of advice. However, to title the book ""Training the Young Horse,"" you are allowing your readers to expect to get information about how to train a young horse. This book has as much information as a letter to the editor would. It's a joke."
3,A lot of strings...but not so much music,"For me it was a surprise that a label as Narada couldn't issue a better guitar sampler than this, considering all the good material that they have. Probably, they privilege a ""Good Seller Sampler"", as a ""young person guide to Narada Guitarists"", than a sampler for their fans. Sorry about that, but for me the only tracks that worth it are ""Ferry"" (Randy Ross), ""November Winds"" (Friedemann) and ""Finger dance"" (B. Mclaughlin). E.R."
2,Could have been much better,"There are 6 tracks that save the cd's from being drink coasters:""Lover's promise"",""My sky at twilight"",""Ferry"",""Breeze from Saintes Maries"",""Simpatico"" and ""Fingerdance"".The rest of the works are bland and bear no repeated listening.One cd would have been more than sufficient considering the lack of great material.Prepare to do a lot of skipping around on these disks. P.S. Get this set only if you happen across it used."
2,Inadequate at best.,"This is obviously the author's first attempt at a historical romance. The conversations are unsatisfactory. So are the love scenes. At the end of the book, I just didn't find it believable that these two people were in love. It was not explained why he found it necessary to marry her. Nor was it explained how someone as poor as she obtained such an exemplorary education. I didn't like Margaret. She was a prejudiced, judgemental hypocrite."
2,So uncomfortable,I have never been able to wear these more than a few minutes without a lot of pain and blisters. It's too bad because they are so cute!
4,Old video,"This is a weird 'old' hot rod video....it's from the late 40's and 50's, not a lot of real racing footage but a good representiation of the period....I was hoping for more documentary than story line...."
3,50's Muscle Cars & Drag Racing,"The sound track on about half of the DVD is defective. It has lots of noise and cuts out. Fortunately, the part I was most interested in was okay."
5,Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is today's Swing!,Track Listing:1. You & Me & The Bottle Makes Three Tonight (Baby)2. Minnie The Moocher3. Jumpin' Jack
5,Big Bad VooDoo Daddy swings harder than Mark McGwire's bat.,"Big Bad VooDoo Daddy creates a style of jazz that conjures up images of smokey lounges in New Orleans or Chicago. They mix catchy lyrics, the talent and ability that jazz requires, and rythms that swing so hard you might get whiplash. Scotty's mellow vocals provide a solid foundation which allows soloists, such as ""The Kid"" (on trumpet), to weave intricate solos which add a certain punch to the band's already bruising sound. All in all, Big Bad VooDoo Daddy brings back the dancable, firey sound that once made swing the most popular music in the world."
5,WOOT more Dexter,"I can not begin to say how much I enjoy this show. The actors are great and the writers have done an amazing job turning the books into the show. Each episode is better then the next with just enough tease to make you put in the next disc, YOUR GUYS OWE MY SOME SLEEP. This show has almost made me get Showtime, but I prefer to wait and get the box sets every year. Who knows one more show like this and I might fall and get it added to my cable."
5,What a killer series!,"My favorite, all time, TV series has been The West Wing hands down. Well finally there is something to compete with it. Dexter is one of THE BEST SHOWS EVER! Season Two is even better than Season One. Without giving anything away, this season has one of the BEST endings in TV History! Great acting! Great Writing! Great Camera work! GET THIS SEASON!"
3,Ok,"The movie played fine but the case was pretty much destroyed the corners looked like someone bashed it against a wall repeatedly this has happened multiple times now when i order things directly from amazon and i can tell you it is not U.P.S.'s Fault! The movie itself though is incredible, but if your ordering the season you most likely already know this."
5,Best series I've watched in a long time.,My husband and I both love Dexter. We just finished watching the 2nd season and can't wait for the 3rd to come out. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys shows with a twist.
5,Dexter Rocks!!!,"This is the best series on TV and the DVD just enhanced the experience. If you are a fan of the show or have thought about watching it, you should buy both seasons 1 & 2 ASAP and get slicing!"
3,Sadly it's not as compelling as series one.,"Dexter series 1 was a roller coaster ride every episode, with a plot that gave you just enough each week to keep you guessing and desperate for the next show.Season 2 just does not have this feel. You find Dexter becoming quite a bit more human; he's being thrown back and forth through little dramas to keep you interested. It comes off as a season either dedicated to shaping him for something really great, or preparing you for a family drama show to come..I'll wait and see if I buy the 3rd DVD set, kind of regret buying season 2 already."
5,Dexter: The Complete Second Season,"I don't subscribe to Showtime, so I am pleased to be able to see Dexter on DVD. It is an unbelievably entertaining show with lots of surprises. I'm looking forward to getting the 3rd Season when it is released. The DVD arrived very quickly & in superb shape."
5,Great Showtime series.,"Great price and prompt delivery. If you are not yet into ""Dexter"" start now. Watching one episode after another in short period of time is much better than watching one episode weekly."
5,So good,"It's like 10 movies. But its a TV series. Well acted, well scripted, beautiful sets. I look forward to watching this every year, it's going to be a bummer when they stop producing it. I'm in Season 6 now and it has yet to lose the suspense or mystery."
5,Addicted,"Got this for my fiancee for Christmas, and we spend the entire day watching it. The next day we subscribed to Showtime and have fully caught up and are absolutely addicted to the show. Love Dexter!"
5,Great show. Read the books.,Title says it all! The show is fantastic. I love Mr. Hall. The books are a must read as well.
4,Dexter - The Complete Second Season,"I started watching this series during the second season and it seemed so dark and morbid. As I got into it I realized that Dexter was really a good man with a desire for justice and if the law did not take care of the evil doer, then he would. I had to buy the first season to see how it all began. The series is captivating and you almost cheer him on when he brings the demise of those that ""almost"" got away with crime. The fear of getting caught is always there and you wonder if he ever will be. I don't like the fact that his sister has a foul mouth but he needs her as I see that he uses her to his advantage. This is a very good series. If you do not believe in ""eye for and eye"" then don't watch it. Otherwise, I recommend it. The language and the killing may be questionable, but it keeps my interest."
4,It was just what I wanted.,Yes this was just what I wanted. It is a new second season of Dexter. What more can I say anyway??
5,Awesome!,I just discovered the series and I can't stop watching! What does that say about me? I'm on season 4 and wish I had ten more seasons to watch.
4,Fantastic 2nd season,"Having watched the 1st season, I wondered how they could better it, but I thought they did. The story arc they introduced was totally unexpected to me, but it worked brilliantly. This was compulsive viewing, although I thought it was a little darker than the last season. The new characters worked well, and Dexter, as ever was played superbly. I would have given it 5 stars, but for.... ***SPOILER FOLLOWS***As another reviewer has already said, the last 5 minutes should have been cut. When Lila left the country that should have been the end of her. Dexter is not an international assassin and so having him fly half way across the globe on a revenge killing is not his style. They tried to wrap it up too neatly. It didn't work. The thought of her coming back could have added some uncertainty into the next series although they could easily have reported her death some other way if they wanted Dexter to be totally in the clear. Brilliant season, but with a goofed ending, I thought."
4,"Perfect Gift, but not for me","Good price and made a great gift. I don't really care for the show, so I'm not going to give 5 stars.... but otherwise a good value!"
1,streaming was horrible for this episode,The show stopped more than 20 times in an hour. It seriously took almost 90 minutes to watch an hour show. The problem was not the internet connection.
2,Dexter S2,"Maybe I'm just over Dexter at this point, but I found this season to be dreadfully boring. Not only that, but the anxiety I felt episode after episode, awaiting Dexter's capture (or not) was neither fun or healthy. Goodbye sweet Dexter, I will miss you."
5,one of the most impressively series of this decade,"I have seen all episodes within two days, but only from the seasons 1+2. Because in austria we haven't any more seasons. Are on the BluRays the German soundtrack, so I will buy the 3+4 too.please give me an answer."
3,Not for latinos,"Dexter - The Complete Second SeasonEscribiré mi revisión en español, precisamente por el fondo de mi asunto. No tengo objeciones con el contenido de esta formidable serie, pero sí con la edición que he recibido, que es la que se comercializa en la actualidad. Me parece una desconsideración con el mundo latino que no vive en norteamérica no disponer de subtítulos en español, en especial con el mundo latino sordo. A lo anterior cabe agregar que, para quienes podemos oir, el doblaje al español de este producto es de pésima calidad."
1,still have not recieved,I ordered this over a month ago and still have not received it. it was supposed to be here in a few days then I get an email that it wont be here until may fourth. now it is may 13th and I still have not received it.
1,"good stuff, but showtime needs to can the advertisements","My gripe is not with the content; rather it is with the intolerable advertisements Showtime FORCES you to watch before you get to see what you paid for. The normal menu-button and/or FF-key options are useless and you must sit and fume before watching each episode. I am sorry I purchased this title from such a clueless, undeserving studio. I will never again purchase a Showtime title."
1,Bad service,"I order Dexter second season, i waited, I had to e-mail the vendor several times, only to find out I woud not receive my order until 35 days later, I received a refund. I still don't have the DVD's I wanted."
1,This series was never alive,"This probably the worsed season to make things even. Season 5 is gonna be great because hopefully they will end it. This show is so meaningless and lackluster its not even worth talking about. bad acting, weak and kinda of a spin off storyline of dark comic books like Spawn and Nightman. Sorry I had to put those awesome characters in the same paragraph as this freak of a show. If you want to watch something cool, even though I think TV as a whole is a waste of time for the most part watch Rescue Me; Dennis Leary is excellent in it and it deals with real issues real heroes have such as PTS, substance abuse, and depression from working and living in modern society. Also House is a great series. Very witty and suspensful, well the first few seasons were.just avoid this garbage altogether."
5,awesome!,i got mine right on time and the shipping was great there was nothing wrong with the dvd at all oval very happy with this purchase! plus great price u save 20 bucks! and free shipping! WIN WIN
4,Gripping Suspense,Dexter season 2 is dark comedy at its best. You get a chance to delve into Dexter's complex personality (if he can claim to one) to find out what makes him tick. Highly recommend!
4,I'm getting low on trashbags...,"The second season wasn't as focused as the first season - I still loved the show. I don't want to give it away, but the Dexter/Doakes thing should've played out a little longer. I didn't care for the comical juggling act Dexter managed through the last episodes and I would've liked to have seen him dispose of more predators. In any event, I watched the season from start to finish as quickly as possible. I think Michael C. Hall is proving himself to be quite the star. He's still likeable as your friendly neighborhood serial killer. Despite these reservations I recommend the series."
5,Dexter:Season 2,"I absolutely love this show! For anyone already into Dexter, this season was great! Can't wait for the third one to come out on dvd! For anyone interested in crime-type shows, this one is a great one! Highly recommend this product."
2,"Good show, poor DVD quality","I enjoyed this program (although not as much as the first season). The biggest problem is the annoying DVD authoring. Not only are you forced to watch a couple of minutes of advertising and warnings on the insertion of each disc, but you can't even go from episode to episode without starting the disc over and going through the process again. Great if you like frustration, bad for normal people."
3,pretty good,"i dig the show Dexter,but season 2 seems to be missing something and it feels more polished and more is forced on. season one was off the hook to me.i still think this is one of the few shows on any network that i can watch and dig something about it, but this season seems a bit off and the writing seems to be forced to appeal or something. still a compelling drama with twists and turns."
3,Dexter Season 2,"I bought Dexter Season 2 in noted ""NEW"" condition. We received the package in a few days in the plastic wrap as it would be at the store. When watching a few of the discs it would pause and say ""skipping over damaged area"". After the message it would continue in with where it left off. I haven't finished all of the discs to see if there are any more problems. We did get this for a good price. Thanks."
5,Intense Drama.. Highly Entertaining.. I LOVE IT,This show has got me hooked big time. Cant wait for season 3 to come.. This show is so far above the norm for tv drama its not fair to call it that. I am so impressed with the acting I have to say it is comparible to The Sopranos.. REALLY.. If you haven't seen it yet.. do yourself a favor and get season one and then two and sit back and be prepared to enjoy!!
2,Dexter loses focus,"Dexter's first season was pretty decent. His apathy and attitude towards life made the show interesting. In the second season, his personality changes into a regular guy who also happens to kill people. The killing isn't why I watched the first season, so this made the show uninteresting to me. You might call that change ""growth"". I call it de-evolution towards a stock character personality."
5,"Great show, not as good as Season 1","I'm a huge fan of Dexter, and the season is a worthy second installment to the series. Like most of these series (HBO, Showtime, etc), I didn't think the second season was as good as the first season. Obviously, since I'm giving it five stars I still enjoyed it immensely and recommend it without hesitation, but there's just something about season 1 that's lacking here. That doesn't take anything away from the acting/production of the cast and crew; it's still top notch. I think what people may be surprised about is how much further Dexter (the character) seems to push the line between good and evil towards ""evil,"" and how, despite this, we still connect, feel, and pull for him.Bottom line: Season 1 was one of the best seasons for a TV show ever, and while Season 2 isn't quite on par with it, it's still great TV that you should watch."
5,I love video on demand and Dexter,I've had great luck with Video on Demand and I think Dexter is one of the greatest series ever done on television. Can't wait for season 4 to be available. It's a bargain compared with a cable subscription.
5,"Dexter may be loosing his killer touch, but the show sure isn't","Showtime has blown HBO off the map with the these two seasons of Dexter. Now that The Sopranos, Deadwood and Rome no longer around, HBO will need a miracle to compete with the quality of this show.Season two is all about conflict and questions. Lila or Rita? Serial killer or turn himself in? There isn't as much ""Dexter Morgan justice"" this time around, but the suspense and top notch acting are here in bucket loads. Just give Michael C. Hall an award already!If you liked the first season (how could you not?) then the second will take you to a different place. They change things up a bit to add freshness, but they never veer too far off course. I think season one was a bit stronger overall, yet I found this one more interesting. I guess it just means that this show is full of surprises."
1,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM I PAID FOR!!!!!!!!!!!@#%$#^$%&$^,"The seller is a LIAR, a THEIF, a CON!! And AMAZON should not allow this seller on their sight!!!!Hey, AMAZON, YOU are also RESPONSIBLE - buyers continue to get ROBBED by this seller and you ALLOW it!!!NOT ETHICAL, NOT HONEST, -- simply LYING, CHEATING, STEALING!!@#%#$^@$!!"
5,Spectacular,"Season 1 had started off with a disturbing bang and ended with one. Season 2 cranks up the disturbingness and darkness and gives us another killer season yet. While the first one had focused mainly on the ice cream truck killer, this one focuses on his struggle with his own identity and who he is. With a grim and menacing 12 episodes, we have a darker feel to the character, a suspecting Sgt. Doakes suspicious about Dexter, Rita's ex-husband coming back to haunt her, and an all-new copycat killer, all of which his situations will have you on the edge of your seat and biting your nails. Season 2 of Dexter proves that you can carry an all new plot and still have a great show that is menacing and dark in every aspect. Overall, if you loved Season 1, be sure to pick this beauty up. As with the first season, this begins with a disturbing bang and ends with one. If you love the darkness and complexity of the first season, do buy this."
5,Dexter: Season 2,"I got hooked watching this replacement show on CBS, so I bought season one and instantly got more hooked! I pre-ordered season two and pretty much had it all watched in 4 days. There is great story writing in this show. The acting is great. Some of the twists and turns in the plot gave me goosebumps. It is one of the best shows going and once you start to watch you can't stop and ask for more. I agree with other reviewers, give Michael C. Hall an award already, actually the whole show. Best Drama on TV."
2,Strange show,Don't get me wrong. I know this is a very popular show with a very unique premise. I have just tried to get into Dexter two or three times and always get a really sick feeling inside. I don't think I will watch again.
4,"WedWabbit's Review of Dexter, Season Two","Great reprise of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, with a righteous lean toward Vigilanteism! His position within the very police department which is conducting the investigation into the crimes Dexter is committing, adds a heady aroma to the show."
5,dalai lama...365 daily readings,"the dalami lama rocks. if more people sought the teachings of buddism the planet would be a safer, happier and healthy place. the book is quality construction. i especially like the range of issues and topics...something for everyone to relate to and pause to ponder."
1,False advertising!!!,I just purchased this product and am sorry I did. For the $38.00 I paid I could have bought 4 of my favorite lip glosses from my local drug store. I am 37 and have relatively full lips and was inticed by the advertising that this product would give my lips a fuller appearance. This product did nothing..I exfoliated my lips well and applied the gloss as directed I did feel a numbing effect and the color was pretty but did not get the advertised fuller/plumper lips. If Lipfusion was so confident in their product they would offer a money back guarantee! That being said they would probably go out of business.
2,No plumping,"I can't believe this company has the nerve to set a price of $38. Amazon had it for $10.59 and I got it with some other alleged plumpers of about the same price to try it out. The current price is $21 -- just ridiculous. It is a pretty lip gloss with a slightly sweet taste. It licks off easily so it doesn't last long. It has no other effect, but the company includes a long information page in many languages with purportedly scientific details and the fact that you'll get best results when it's used in combination with several of their other products. Incredible. I don't give it one star because I save that for products that actually cause harm or are extraordinarily displeasing."
4,Great!,"Keeps my lips soft and shiny. I think the plumping is working. Like all glosses, it does get sticky, but this one resists it more than others I've tried."
2,wife doesn't like it,Not as good as the XL version. but it is a nice gloss so my wifes says. she gave the rest of it to a friend.
1,Don't bother with this one,Nope. Doesn't work. As a lip gloss it's okay but you can find a better lip gloss at a better price anywhere.
1,Didn't work for me,"Didn't experience any difference in lip texture, plumping, moisture, nothing. Tingly? Yes. Anything beyond that? No. Could not use under lipstick in the morning or it would smear off. Applied it, left it on as long as possible but eventually had to remove what was left before applying lipstick. Applied at night before bedtime. No noticeable difference for me. Disappointed."
1,lipfusion,"I with the lady who said this is a waste of money. If you are looking for a nice color with a shine lipstick go to a store, and get a nice one for a lot less. I was looking for the plumping, and there wasn't any."
2,very little of a great product.,"This product works as promised, stimulating a ""slightly puffy lip"" response within one minute or less... However, it is gone within about 20 minutes. So you will feel great walking out the door or getting a quick photo...but it doesn't last long. In my experience, a reapplication does not give the same response... unless you wait for a few hours or wash off all your lip stain or lip stick and re-apply. And, not much in the .29oz tube...for the cost.But it does exactly what it promises."
3,Not sure if product was brand new...?,"I'm not sure if this was a brand new product. It came in a Fusion Beauty box, but was not sealed, and it felt and looked empty...as in I could see through the tube. The color is pretty, and maybe for the price, you only deserve a quarter of a tube! LOL I won't bother to return, but I won't buy LipFusion from this seller again. Just sayin."
1,Shelf life,This was obviously on sale because it's been on a shelf for awhile. I'd guess a year or two.The color wasn't right and I don't get the same tingle or plumping effect as with the product normally.
1,not as promised,"Doesn't perform as claimed. Good moisterizing lip cream with a tingle, but no better plumping performance for lips than any of several brands already tried, some cheaper and many more expensive. Perhaps a topical can't really do the trick."
1,"So much hype, so little truth","I used this limp plumber for 3 weeks 3 to 4 times a day. Even thought it kept my lips well moisturized and full, it didn't do anything more than the Blistex Ointment I use in the Winter and which costs about 1/30 of the price! It's just a good lip moisturizer. Needless to say, I returned it to Sephora."
2,save your money,Save your money. I only gave this product 2 stars because it does keep my lips from drying out like they usually do by the end of the day. But thats a pretty darn expensive chap stick if thats all it does. I wasnt expecting to look like Angelina Jolie BUT a little bit of change would have been great after spending over 35 bux! So save your money and go buy a few tubes of blistex or chapstick. I wish I had!
4,I think this is a pretty great product-,"LipFusion is an overall good product. For me, it plumps although not as much as I would like. I don't want to end up looking like Meg Ryan but I don't wanna be Reba McIntyre either. Overall though, I really like it and have purchased it several times, and have bought the colored LipFusion as well. The best thing about it over some of the other 'lip plump' products I think, is the smell. It has a nice subtle citrusy smell. I would definitely recommend this to a friend (and have on many occasions.)"
1,"If hot and tingling equals plump, my lips should be obese...","...and yet, they are not. To be fair, I don't really have what would be considered thin lips, but they could use a slight pump. So, I use as directed; I promise. Here's what I get: glossy, wet, mildly burning lips with a sweet taste. Plump? Notsomuch. And the guy I kissed with LipFusion had an allergic reaction. Good thing I only kissed him on the lips..."
5,Love it!!!,"This stuff is ""so"" much better than the too-faced plumper. The trick is to put it on about 5 minutes prior to lipstick application. Consider it a primer...and it really does last and last and last! Hail to LipFusion!"
3,Good Performance...Text mutilated...,"While this is a good performance of this great opera it suffers from the fact that a number of ""liberties"" are taken with the libretto. Abbado's version of Carmen (as is far too often the case in operatic performance) is based on an abridged and mutilated text. It is unfortunate that so many conductors (or record executives?) continue to issue performances of operas in such a historically perverse form."
2,Femme Fatale ... for the music of Bizet,"Berganza isn't a tragic actress. Her bright voice is deprived of true sensuality. No sign of intensity, no ""tears in her eyes"". Only feeling's convincing - the hate: after her furious last ""Tiens!"" I understand that Jose has nothing but kill her.The vocal aspect of this interpretation is also sad: Carmen requires finest musicality and perfect voice control that Berganza can hardly provide. Her tempi are mechanical, accents - primitive, the lack of dynamic shades - fatal. Sometimes she produces beautiful sound, but generally lower register sounds rough, tremolos - not elastic enough, tops - screaming (last ""tra-la-la"" in ""Seguedille"" - just awful).Though Domingo's interpretation is as always excellent vocally, he can't touch me still. Cotrubas's charming, her musicality excites me. Chorus sounds wonderful. Abbado's button is uneven: sometimes - good ( ""A deux cuatros""), most times - not (sleepy ""oiseau rebelle"", too fast final)."
1,don't waste your money,"this piece is a typical case of Abbado's boring work. he sometime does impressive work such but you hardly see it. Carmen would be the ideal opera to start with but do not start with ordinary conductor. the best Carmen shoud be the two versions of Karajan's. if you doubt my word, just try listening both of them from this site."
3,Not That Riotous A Romp After All,"I was dissapointed in this book, written by the keyboard player for one of my favorite bands, the Faces. Like virtually every other book I've ever read by or about a rocker (small 'r', not Rocker, with a big ""r', which a good Mod would still take as an insult, I'm sure), ALL THE RAGE is little more than a litany of boozy gigs, plane trips, dull hangovers, and bad business deals."
2,Unbelievable,"Wonder if he would sit and read a similar story about my life as a dope smoking, beer drinking, coke snorting, rock and roll fan? Somehow I doubt it. Perhaps if he didn't indulge as much as he did, he would have been able to write a better book. With stories I could trust to be true. He made me laugh a couple times, so I gave it a star for each of those laughs. If he sticks to what he's good at, and that would be rocking and rolling on the keyboards, he will become a legend. But no more writing books Ian. Please."
4,"Gee, who would have thought.","Well written and very interesting, a book the CIA and its former employees would like to disappear. One big problem is the author's take on JFK's assassination. Obviouly a coup with the miltary, CIA, FBI, and the mafia being involved, blaming the Cubans and the Soviets is ignoring the facts at hand."
4,"Good Read, But A Lot Of Information","This is a great book, however with the amount of information presented, you may have to do as I did and read it several times to fully grasp what you just read. The only beef that I have with the author is that many of his claims in the book are not supported by facts or rather he does not support the information. But that was with only one or two passages that I came across. All in all, this is a great read and well worth the money."
2,Best taken with a grain of salt,"The good news - this book is full of conspiracy theories and astounding allegations guaranteed to make your hair stand on end. The author loves sensational language, and the book reads in places like a pulp fiction novel. The bad news - the author provides scant evidence to support his more outlandish conclusions, many of which seem to be at odds with the facts as related by distinguished historians."
1,The Dangers Of Awful Research Is More Accurate,"I'm afraid Mr. Pribbenow is right; I wasted my money on this one.According to this book, CIA hasn't done a thing right since 1947, which would be fine, if the book were entitled, ""CIA Hasn't Done A Thing Right Since 1947"" or if the reader decides to make peace with the premise, ok, it's nothing but the bad stuff; plow ahead anyway.But when Mr. Trento attempts to address the assassination of President Kennedy by framing it as a Soviet operation via Cuba, I realized the facts presented here are so contrary to the evidence it became impossible for me to read anything further. It couldn't be worse if his history of CIA included Columbus' arriving in New York aboard a nuclear submarine in 1492.I have a half-read book. Save your money and time, read anything else."
1,Tabloid Journalism Posing as History,"I am a retired CIA careerist, having served 30 years including five in Germany during the mid 60s, including a tour in Berlin. The author writes a one-sided ""tale"" of the agency, full of rumor, innuendo, and distorted history. He projects the purported colorful stories of several former employees and Berlin Base activities onto 20,000 other employees worldwide. I knew and worked with many of the named and respected persons in the book. He shows a lack of unserstanding of the intelligence process, chain of command, Agency mission and successes. He concentrates on tales of failure and penetrations, some of which are true, to the exclusion of the many productive operations. He does severe discredit to the thousands of agency employees who had dedicated careers often at great sacrifice to themselves and their famiies. He should have been working for the KGB who had similar goals during the cold war--destroy the CIA. Don't waste your money."
1,"The ""Secret"" must be Trento's one-sided view of of the CIA!!","I like a good book but NOT when the author does nothing but write about one side of the story without announcing it in the title!! I bought this book thinking i would get a good overall view of the CIA and some of the good and the bad...well so much for the good!Would not recommend this book to anyone unless you are looking for the ""dirt"" on the CIA and even then i would have to question it as it is so lop sided. Sorely disappointed in this book and am irritated i wasted my money on this book."
1,Garbage!!!Don't waste your money!,"I've never wasted so much money and time on reading a fictions book filled with garbage and non-sense.The only finding you will read on this book is that the Author's main goal is bashing the US and its agencies with nativity and utter ignorance.It's not worth spending even $2.44 dollars on this book. Read something better.The book has no substance, narration and facts. It's more like an extract of the communist manifesto, most likely aiming to stain the image of those who sacrificed everything for our great nation!Garbage!!!"
4,A very interesting biographical novel,"Copyright 2003, Peter van Wyk ISBN 1-4120=0901-4This comment relates to the interest and knowledge conveyed to me by the book. An assessment of style and typography would find other points to be at fault to an extent that would relate to the stylist's benchmarks. The biographical novel of the life of Fred Burnham does however show key events of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; in North America, Britain and South Africa, and there is not a boring page in the 500 plus book.The story is of the life of Fred Burnham, a man who was clearly unique. It appears to closely follow the set out of a book by Burnham called ""Scouting on Two Continents""."
3,Amazing,They bring something alot of bands dont bring to the table. Having a live dvd to prove it was a lot of people need. I think this is one band everyone needs to listen to or atleast check out .
5,2 great artists,Performing with an incomparable orchestra. The selections are well chosen and the quality of the music is excellent. I'm very pleased with this and I own the music unlike what I used to buy at ITunes where I almost never shop anymore.
3,Good But Not Great,This is a good book about the Einstein and Bohr debates and doesn'tdelve into complex math but you won't find any great insights intothings.John
1,Real dillema is how to get refund.,"This book is not for scientists or laypeople interested in science. It falls into that field of science history where only the other 3 historians in the field will be forced to read. The most informative part of the book are the figures. (i.e, the data is not tarnished by trite, and insightless garble). Perhaps better entitled ""Writing Quantum Foam."""
3,Extremely Challenging DVD!,I love the 10 Minute Solution series and I think Lara Hudson is a great instructor. But this workout DVD was not for me because I am not at all that flexible to do many of the routines here. I find the 10 Minute Solution Fitness Ball Workouts with Kimberly Spreen and Lara's Pilates For Beginners DVDs much easier for my fitness level.
2,Not too happy,This instructor talks way too fast and it makes the workout very un-relaxing and hard to keep up with her. If you're a beginner in pilates like I am I suggest you not buy this DVD.
4,Good for an extra pilates challenge,"This dvd is great for someone looking for versatility and a bit of an extra challenge from standard pilates. The ten minute sets are great for time constraints, and the ball adds extra intensity. However, I wouldn't recommend this dvd for pilates beginners."
5,10 Minute Solution: Pilates on the Ball,"This is an excellent DVD for stability ball work. The instructor's cues are pithy, and her versions of the various exercises are challenging and rewarding. As a certified Pilates instructor, I've used this DVD to refresh my repertoire of ball exercises as well as motivate me before I teach my ball class. I can recommend this DVD highly--it does exactly what the description on the box says: gives you ""compact and ultra-efficient"" workouts for abs, lower body, upper body, flexibility, and total body."
5,10 Minute Solution - Pilates on the Ball is great,"This is my first of the ""10 Minute Solution"" videos and I'm glad I bought it. There are five different segments on the DVD, so you can just do one for 10 minutes, or if you have a little more time, you can do a few of them. The instructions are good."
2,too hard for beginners,"Although the production of this dvd is excellent, it is not for beginners. A stronger, more advanced student would appreciate it."
2,not incredibly impressed,"This DVD is horribly frustrating. Many of the workouts are made difficult because the ball is hard to control, and slips away. The movements go too fast for me to keep up because I'm trying to get the ball wedged the right way, and by the time I'm in position, she's moved on to something else. I quit this after one week in favor of normal pilates."
3,Not for beginners,"The good bit: I found that the DVD was well structured with 10 min sequences that provide a good workout at an intermediate to advanced level.The not so good bit: I personally found the music and atmosphere of the DVD rather hectic, that is to say not relaxing, and rather lacking the elegance and harmony of what Pilates, in my opinion, is all about.I would not recommend this video for beginners as it is rather lacking in cues for breathing, and seems to assume a prior knowledge of the techniques of employing one's core strength."
4,"A good workout, exept the part with the weights","All in all a good workout. The instructor is pleasant, and the ball add some fun to the workout. But - This is not a beginners exercises. The last part for flexibility and relexation is exellent."
2,Solutions are not very clear. Some problems are not solved.,"Yes, some problems are not solved. Why bother and mention them in a ""problem book"" if they are not solved? I only bought this for solutions.2 stars for containing some good solved problems although the solutions are not very detailed."
3,To all serious students,Getting expertness in Physics may not be achived until one try to solve problems more and more and the best way to obtain such ability is work with these titles.This book with its brief cotents covers many key ideas which is necessary for undergraduate quantum mechnics corse. I find it very useful.
2,Really bad recording quality and waste of time / money :(,"I wondered how bad this could be, great Broadway titles, fun songs... Not so :( very disappointing... I ended up pitching the whole CD"
2,Isaiah,"I was searching for another Isaiah Bible study, having finished the others I found. However, this one is a study I would recommend for beginning Bible students; it's not an in-depth study."
3,Content is fine just extremely hard to use a study guide on Kindle,I think the product is good but the Kindle format doesn't fit the purpose. It does a great job explaining the history so the prophecies are understandable.
2,Not the best,I always think tchiakowsky has pretty songs but these records is not that pretty. They sound rushed and hectic. the horns does not sound like American players do. I think the ruskies must have used steroids.
4,Denon DVD-1910 with 720p/1080i DVI,The Faroudja's FLI-2301 DCDi decoding engine is the best I have seen. I currently use my DVD-1910 to feed my 1080p Samsung DLP (converting the DVI to HDMI). The image is super. One quirk noticed is that the image is even better when the player is outputting 720p rather than 1080i. This is most likely do to the TV rather than the player.The only thing keeping me from awarding 5 stars is the very noticable pause when changing layers. It seems to last quite longer than the other dvd players I have owned.
2,Thundrous Organ!!,This is one of my favorite symphonies. I actually use it to walk on the treadmill and work out on the bike! It is lovely = very full organ!!
3,there's something missing,"Certainly Levine and BPO play magnificently. However, the problem is, it doesn't sound like Saint-Saens. Levine performs this piece like the Bruckner. There's no Gallic charm at all, it sounds just heavy. And BPO betrays too much of its German quality. The Dutoit on Decca has more idiomatic Saint-Saens sound with full of Gallic nuance."
3,Missouri Mayhem,"One has to give credit to the director for a very realistic recreation of the Missouri and Kansas areas during the Civil War. Sadly there are long dry spots in the film where action all but stagnates. Although it could be argued these were necessary for the story line, in the end it does detract significantly from the film's watchability. It's OK, but yet another CW film that crashed straight to the DVD market despite its expense."
5,~Tobey as a Cowboy~,This is an Amazing Film. Not only is Tobey Maguire in it. But the story is very interesting. The battle scenes were really good. Its one of those films that you would watch over and over again.
5,An Inconvenient Truth,"The film's poor box office may have been due to viewers not believing and therefore, not liking the fact that Jeffrey Wright's freed slave character (Holt) chose to fight for the South. We are taught that all slaves and all former slaves hated their masters; they did not. We are taught that all Blacks in the South were slaves; they were not . Why did some Blacks fight for the South? The same reason Whites fought for the South: to defend their homes, their families and their way of life. Had the South freed the slaves and then fired on Fort Sumter, history may have turned out very different for the Confederacy."
4,"Excellent Movie, But NOT Liberal PC Hollywood","... Having read a number of historical accounts of the era, I found the picture for the most part accurate (I agree that the encounter outside of Lawrence never occurred and was probably staged for dramatic effect). What I find most surprising about the picture is Ang Lee's mastery of the subject matter. Clearly he knew what he wanted and got it on film. In my opinion, Lee acquits himself on this film at least as well as he did in ""Sense and Sensibility"".The acting by this ensemble cast is quite good. Skeet Ulrich is very turned in a fine performance and Jewel was, surprisingly, quyite good in her first movie performance. Tobey Maguire shows once again why he is clearly the best young actor in films today. One word of warning-this film is quite violent. If you can handle that, then I highly suggest watching this motion picture."
3,a movie made where i was born in 1946,"i purchased this movie because it was partially filmed in pattonsburg missouri,where igrew up. ilived there till i was 12 years old. the movie was pretty good,but seemed to be very uneven . the filming was very dark ,and the characters were never fully explained. i did visit pattonsburg 10/25/06 but all that was left was rows of corn. they moved the original town 2 miles north,because the entire town was flooded with 10 foot of water in 1993, it took 3 years to move the town."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","I have to admit that Civil War movies are not on the top of my war movie lists, but several factors attracted me to try this one. Toby Mcquire and Skeet Ulrich sounded like a pretty good head line, and actually they did do an admiral job. I am also a huge fan of Jewel and wanted to see how she came across on the big screen.The film seems to get bogged down in the mire at some point and never really takes off. The efforts are valiant enough, but something just didnt click with it.All in all it is worth watching, but it will not stay with you, or make you want to watch it again."
2,anarchy,I found this to be an uninspired dreary and sadistic little movie. Tobey Maguire was OK ... he softened up the content slightly with his soft approach to everything ... you can understand why this film did such poor boxoffice
3,I've definately seen better...,"I'll be honest; I only bought this film because Jonathan Rhys-Meyers had a decent-sized role. I think if it weren't for the eye-candy being displayed on screen I'd have turned it off! First off, the plot was very weak. I was never shown a real reason as to why these young men risked their lives for the Confederacy. Sure, So-and-so shot So-and-so-else's father or whatnot, but please, that was NOT the base of the civil war! Second, the music was pitiful... being from the South myself, I know a synthetic banjo when I hear one. And I tell you, those were some pretty sorry synthetic banjos to boot! Same goes for violins. I'd think even Northerners could play a violin! The last thing I wish to moan about at present are the accents used; I may have heard three good imitations. They either tried too hard or didn't try at all! I can make some better recommendations for eye candy!"
2,Not what I expected,"Plodding in parts and somewhat banal, I didn't enjoy this movie. Perhaps I had higher expectations of it but I thought more could have been done with it. Dialogue was somewhat poor and the pace slow."
4,Good flick,"Of course, I grew up in that part of the country, so take that fwiw.Excellent early effort from Ang Lee and the cast. Even Jewel is mostly watchable. Rhys Meyers is especially good...of course, he's playing the sociopath type character he always does, so...Not sure if acting, or actually sociopath."
5,Ride With the Devil Won Me Over,This movie of one of the darkest periods in our history is very moving and shows the personal tribulation that the average person endured. I have watched over and again. I highly recommend!
