1,Pa-leeze!,"What a joke. Was so looking forward to Gramma's coffee. No.1, the pot arrived dirty, scratched and stinkey. Even had loose grounds floating around. Can't wait to send this baby back! $100.00 ? PA-LEEZE!!!CJ Berg"
2,Great Coffee - Short Lived,"We are great coffee lovers and purchased this coffee maker in Sept, 2001. It made great coffee and was fun to watch. It is a coffee hog, but worth it for the flavor. We began to have trouble (May 2002) with it not completely depositing the coffee back into the bottom chamber. After some research we determined that it might need a filter change. We purchased and installed a replacement filter, that did not solve the problem. We found that if we only lightly placed the top chamber onto the pot that we would have an 80% chance of success.Yesterday, I loaded the pot up to brew our morning coffee and the unit did not work at all! The operating light is on, but no operation happening. I am now shopping for a new coffee maker - it will not be the same one - altho it was nice while it lasted.Another note - the equipment became unattractively stained from the coffee."
1,Stopped Working After ONE pot!,"I bought this coffee maker yesterday...Soon as we got home I read the instruction manual and made a pot of great coffee. My husband was thrilled as the coffee was very hot & he is tired of always having to heat his Capresso made coffee in the microwave.All was well for about 1/2 hour when I noticed the light was off in the bottom of the pot & the on/off display which previously was set with the time was now blank. It just died for no reason.Thought maybe I did something wrong, so I tried to make another pot this morning & the whole unit is dead....back it goes, not getting another one either."
2,Replacement Filter.....,"I too, have purchased a Bodum Santos coffee maker. It makes an excellent cup of coffee with a great show.The problem is the filter. Mine has a slight tear in it, and is now allowing grounds to enter the coffee. Numerous searches ...have not produced a replacement filter.After an initial e-mail from Bodum, they no longer respond. Bodum stated that by the end of September, they would feature this coffee maker on their web site, but to this date, have not. The only other bit of info that they provided was that if you need a filter, you should go to Starbucks, because they also sell them. Well the Starbucks near me does sell the coffee maker, but not the filters.I am sorry to say that for such a great cup of coffee, this product is not worth the aggravation and expense."
4,Great Coffee! Needs some design work!,"This vacuum coffeemaker makes great coffee! However, the plastic parts are too fragile for the kind of use a coffeemaker gets on a daily basis. Because the parts are made of a hard acrylic plastic they crack easily and eventually fail, far sooner than they should.Regarding the cleaning of this machine, it is difficult if you do not have a soft cotton dish mop. The open for the coffeemaker is small to hold the brewing container, therefore making it too small to get your hand in to clean the inside of the pot.I gave the coffeemaker an overall rating of 4 because it does make great coffee but I only use it when I have guest because it is so fragile and I want it to last awhile."
2,Fun in the Beginning; Quickly Loses Charm,"Bought two in the past year-- won't buy another. This coffee maker was great fun to watch at first-- volcanic action right on your countertop. Coffee was also good at first-hot and strong with the taste of the ""oils"" from the coffee beans. But clean up is messy, and the carafe is virtually impossible to clean without getting the electric base wet-- which is what ended up failing on both our machines. Also, the filter has to be changed frequently or the coffee will taste muddy. Too much money for what initially was a fun ""conversation piece""."
1,bad coffee blues,"I recently purchased this unit based on all of the great customer reviews. However, my experience has been quite different. I tried everything, using a less coarse ground, using more coffee, but nothing seems to work, each cup is more distasteful than the last. It tastes like coffee from a gas station."
2,Disappointing,"My unit gave out in about two months. Fortunately, I had kept my Mr Coffee. The Bodum 3000 left coffee dregs at the bottom of the cannister and used more coffee (if I understood the instructions correctly), and I didn't taste much difference, as far as I am concerned, between my French roast as brewed in it and other standard brands of coffee maker I've used. To me, the advertised ""theatrical"" element is not worth the expense, trouble or results. The fact that the heating element stopped working in such a short time requires no comment."
1,Mine broke too,"I got this Bodum Santos coffee maker in Dec 2003 for Christmas. I try to take care of it and use it carefully. My plastic lid to the jug broke in the past month. Guess I got 6 months out of it. I e-mailed Bodum. The e-mail said to call and when I did they tried to tell me the part isn't covered under their two year warranty. They said only the electronics are covered. Finally after 5-6 minutes of conversation, they agreed to send me a new lid. I had a older Braun machine for 9 years, never had a problem and my Dad and Step Mom took it when I got the Bodum to use daily in their store. While I like the looks of the Bodum Santos, I suspect Bodum will not honor their warranty and there will be problems, like so many others indicate. Spend your money on something else."
2,buy something eles,I bought this for my parents as a christmas gift they had it less than a year and it has already broke huge cracks have appeared in the bottom of the pot and one day we walked into a flood of coffee in the kitchen. Not very happy for the price of the machine it is fun to watch and the coffee tastes great but hey it should last longer than 10 months Also it is very picky with the coffee grinds you use sometimes the coffee will not go down it will remail in the pot if not fine enough i say it is to much work for acup of coffe stick to mr coffe or cuisinart!
2,Makes weak coffee,I bought this same coffee maker from Starbucks (Bodum manufactures the coffee maker for Starbucks). It seemed with each use the time the water would spend in the top chamber with the coffee grounds became shorter and shorter. The result was a very weak cup of coffee. I followed the instructions to the letter. I tried experimenting with the size of the coffee grind and the amount of coffee I used. All to no avail. I ended up returning it to Starbucks and reverting back to my Braun drip coffee maker.
3,disappointed in this coffee maker,"after much research on coffee makers, we purchased the Bodum Santos when our 12 year old Braun started to fail. for about the first month, it worked great. then the rubber ring on the bottom of the pot came off, the coffee dripped down & then bubbled up to the top chamber a second time, and then alot of the water didn't drip down into the pot.so we returned it & got another one. after one week, we went to make coffee & nothing happened. so now we'll return this one & we are thinking of getting a different brand.very disappointed in this unit - the coffee is wonderful, but i think there is a serious design flaw here."
4,Can't get replacement filters,I have been more than satisfied with the electric Santos 12-cup coffeemaker but disappointed that replacement filters are unavailable. Have been waiting 6 months and the web site continues to show out-of-stock.
2,"Made great coffee, but fell apart twice in 3 months","I bought the blue model about 6 months ago. Loved it, really made great coffee, but when I changed the filter, it broke. Wrote to bodum, they quickly sent me a new filter, but after a few more weeks, I picked the pot up and the handle fell off! Bodum offered to repair it, but haven't sent it in yet. Pretty disappointed, it seems to be well made...but..."
3,Great Coffee - Bad Electronics,"Owned two and both stopped working due to bad electronics. So sad because it makes the world's best coffee. If Bodum would use a new electronics system and sell them again, I would buy one in a flash. Jim"
2,A great coffee pot with serious safety issues,"This coffee pot made a great cup of coffee. We like our coffee STRONG and traditional basket style filter pots won't allow you to use enough grounds to make good, strong, HOT coffee.Unfortunately, after no time at all, the plastic pot lid broke off. Oh well, we used it anyway, who needs a lid?THEN, the warmer plate went berserk. It now turns itself back to SUPER heat and boils the leftover coffee as tho it is trying to run the brew cycle again. This is clearly a safety issue and is quite dangerous as it results in burnt coffee in the bottom and (without a lid) boiling coffee spewing all over the kitchen. I do not know if the auto-off feature is working but I suspect not.Clearly we've discontinued use, after probably only a year of irregular use.We're back to searching for a maker that will brew a good strong pot of coffee."
1,over rated and over priced,"We take our coffee very seriously so we were thrilled to find the Santos coffemaker ... through Amazon. We had read rave reviews from several sources about this machine and were eager to experience perfect java. The Santos was easy to use and fun to watch, but the coffee that we made was no better than what we routinely make with a drip grind machine and a gold plated filter(Braun, about 20 bucks) or a coffee press. We tried three different kinds of beans (all from Starbucks) and varied the amount (yes, you do need at least 2 scoops per cup, not 1 as suggested). If you do need a simple drip machine, .... Save your money and spend it on beans instead of the Santos contraption."
2,An Easy Bake Mom,"When I purchased this book I was looking for Easy Bake Recipes made from scratch, as the prepackaged Easy Bake Mixes were expensive, and not very tasty. Instead what I got was a book expanding on the use of Easy Bake Mixes. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BAKE IN YOU'RE EASY BAKE OVEN FROM SCRATCH, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK YOUR LOOKING FOR."
4,There's a new singer-songwriter on the block,"The GoodThe title track is laden with rich piano and soft guitar grooves. Nathan Ferraro delivers his vocals in sort of a quick reggae style at first, but soon fits right into a beautiful harmonic tone. ""Change For You"" is rich in emotion and melody. ""Nobody Understands"" is a pure vocal showcase for Ferraro. He eventually gets some instrumental accompaniment, but with such a voice, he doesn't really need it. ""A Million Fireflies"" is a guitar riff oriented track in which Ferraro challenges his range, and delivers quite a punch.The BadOnly 4 songs longThe VerdictThere's a new singer-songwriter on the block and his name is Nathan Ferraro. He can't take all the credit, because with his band The Midway State, they deliver some great pop-rock compositions full of melody and personal experiences. Can't wait to hear what's next. full of muscle and energy, with slight references to the 90s industrial sound."
1,This CD SUCKS!!!,"Wish I knew who the artists were before I spent money on this CD.I've heard auditioning kids on American Idol sound better.Sorry, guess I'm just not a traditionalist folk music fan.Guess I'll keep listening to the old covers I've been hearing thepast 40 years.Bottom line. If you don't want to be disappointed like I was, DON'Twaste your money."
3,Lukewarm,"This movie isn't brilliant. It's creepy. It's disturbing. Which are lusses in my book. But there could have been *so* much more that could have been added to make the storyline plausible. All in all, in my opinion, forgettable. A good one time watch."
4,One of the most enjoyable MOH episodes you'll ever see,"Family, directed by the great John Landis (An American Werewolf in London, Animal House) and written by Brett Hanley (Frailty) stars Cheers veteran George Wendt as a suburban serial killer, who keeps the skeletons of his victims in his home acting as his ""family"". When new neighbors move in (Meredith Monroe, Matt Keeslar), his life gets further complicated, especially when he starts eyeing the wife as a new addition to his family. What it may lack in the blood and gore department, Family more than makes up with the delicious twists and turns that the episode ends up taking. Wendt is great, and the episode as a whole ends up being one of the best things John Landis has committed to celluloid in quite a while. All in all, Family is one of the most enjoyable Masters of Horror episodes you'll ever see, and is also one of the best as well."
3,Funny,"This could be an episode of Alfred Hitchkock presents, a nice funny story with a wicked ending.The three actors are giving great performances.Not much gore, some blood and melting bodies, but that's John Landis and it's better than ""Deerwoman""."
4,Disappointed A Little But Still Really Good,"For the most part, I really liked the Family. CGI takes me out of films a lot of the time and it was no exception this time. To the fake looking CGI blood when a woman gets her head smashed by a hammer (don't want to spoil, so I won't say who) to an old man having chemicals that deteriorate his body as it is poured on his lifeless self. It looked a fake and cheap. The story itself, on the other hand, is really good. It is basically John Landis' homage to films like Psycho and Last House on the Left. If you have seen those movies, then this film doesn't really hold that many shocks or twists."
4,A good laugh and lots of fun!,"I ordered this product because one of my friends is actually in it, and we had a great time watching the whole season and showing it to our friends. The show is ridiculous and very funny, and watching the expressions on these poor unsuspecting poeple's faces is priceless and definatly worth the watch!"
5,10 Stars!! 10 Stars!!!,"My intentions were to actually get Season One cuz I don't like to start in tha middle but I already knew this was funny. This DVD collection is extremely and I personally think it's better than Punk'd. This is something I can watch over and over and over again for an instant laugh.I recommend you get all three seasons but I have to go back to the store and get Season One because I don't have that yet.Bottomline, the funniest version of Candid camera...well actually, it's in a class all by itself.Thums Way Up!"
3,It was not what I was expecting,I was looking for a falange for my lansinoh breastpump. This one worked but it doesnt replace my broken falange.
3,"Ok, I guess","The flanges that came with my pump were too small so i ordered these which were the next size up and they were a little too big but ok. Even with the handsfree bra, i still had to hold them close because of the extra space. so, it didnt fit me like i needed it to, but may be perfect for the next woman of course. Sturdy and easy to clean."
1,Get Real,"Dr Laura I'm afraid is hopelessly out of touch. Oprah I can understand but you listen to Ms Schlesinger and realize that she really has no idea what life is like without a few tens of millions in the bank. Life is complicated and messy. Religion plays an important role in a world of increasing insecurity. God bless those who can stand on the montaintop and tell people how to live their lives and how they're not measuring up. If you're that type of masochist, Ms. S is the woman for you, to all others I suggest you follow the golden rule, treat yourself right, do good and live the most spiritually rewarding life possible for yourself and your family. Above all, follow the bible and leave jugement to God. It's not your business to caste judgement on others or for that matter allow others to do that to you."
3,Good Book - Even if you are a working parent,"This book provides good advice on parenting and is a good resource. It does ignore important research and statistics on quality, loving child care situations. It also ignores the fact that a large majority of the children with a stay-at-home parent still go to a babysitter or preschool on a regular basis so mom/dad can have some needed ""time off"" - a luxury not had by prior decades stay-at-home moms. I enjoy Dr. Laura's books and radio show - even if there are areas where we disagree. This book is still wonderful and should be read by all parents.(Remember when writing reviews (Judith), if you want to point out how you have to ""brave abuse"" because you are a stay-at-home"" mom, don't do it by bashing working mom's. Perhaps you need to read ""The Girlfriends Guide to Getting Your Groove Back"" to learn respect for others' family plan.)"
1,If no stars were an option...,This is one sad excuse for a self-help book. This woman offers only her opinion and glosses over important research in the area. She doesn't really understand human behavior all that well and has an even more difficult time writing coherently. She seems like such an angry woman and even her advice comfirms it. I'd highly recommend avoiding this book at all costs. It's a waste of time and money.
1,Book is too Black and White,"Dr. Laura puts everything in absolutes. Too bad life is not as black and white as she makes appear. I didn't find her book helpful to my situation. A book I highly recommend for parents/couples is ""Good Parents Bad Parenting."" The author of this book deals in reality and was very helpful to my husband and myself."
3,about to buy this book,"I gave this three stars only because I haven't read it YET. I'm ordering it. I feel I MUST respond to the critics. I listen to Dr. Laura and she is the FURTHEST you can get from ""pop"" Psychology as one reviewer stated. She goes against what is popular today. She makes me uncomfortable sometimes but I know what she's saying is right. I feel the things she says are what God would tell us if we asked - standards we know we should follow but try to rationalize sometimes. Raising kids requires VERY high standards that are hard to meet when something is more important to us, when it's REALLY difficult to put our wants/needs aside and do what's right for our kids. She stands up for children and what is right when it goes against the grain. Thank you Dr. Laura."
1,pompous self righteous drivel,"Sorry, Laura, I refuse to call a pop shrink a doctor, but this book along the rest your ""cataloge"" is worse than useless; it is harmful. Her set of morals are crafted from a hodgepodge of flimsy pop attitudes that ultimately serve only to glorify Larua's ever increasing ego. I find it humorous that people will look everywhere but their own soul for advice on life. People will look to almost any one else. Namely, a woman who professses moral accountability but when life throws her curveball she hides and denies (i.e. her false denial that a set of nude photographs depicted her in very imtimate detail.) Sorry but Laura's monotone harping (on husbands, children et, al,) is neither emotionally helpful nor intellectually beneficial. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Stupid Things Dr. Laura did with her book...,"It started out good but after a few chapters, I lost interest.The outline was sound. However, it tended to be too drawn out to hold my attention.It could have used a few more realistic examples/scenarios in how to handle those types of situations that Dr. Laura is advising the reader to avoid.I would have also enjoyed a little more humor as parenting, requires it."
5,The BEST informative book ever,"Stupid Things Parents Do To Mess Up Their Kids: Don't Have Them If You Won't Raise ThemThis is by far the most make sense information and Dr. Laura has really nailed this topic. She understands the commitment that people need to make to raise their children so they become the intelligent, caring, nurturing future generation we need in order for our world to survive. Thats it in a nut shell. Thank you Dr. Laura.Sincerely,Concerned Committed Parent"
2,A little disappointing,"This was a cute book with some nice illustrations, but really had very little to do with adoption and was a bit expensive for such a quick read. It got a couple of giggles from my four-year old and six-year old, but they've never asked to read it since that first time."
2,"Typical management book: all talk, no action.","It is a must own book if you want to impress people: all the jargons and diagrams can make anyone sounds good. But if you want to have a real impact of the company, you better find another book."
4,Very complex,"And by complex I don't mean a deep thinking, analytical book. There are alot of pictures, drawings, charts, graphs, etc in here and if you don't know much about finance, you will be lost on occasion. It's a pretty decent read if you can find one for a good price.In regards to the person from April 28, 1999, if you can seriously and honestly say that PricewaterhouseCoopers ""...Obviously, the authors' have no background in corporate finance..."" then you need to keep away from any business books."
4,Pretty good.,"Not as bad trilogy at all. I have a fear of spiders too so the details about the scralers got to me. But all in all it was a good read, and it's hard to beat a free book."
4,tarot decoded,This book has taken a comprehensive look at information which is typically just touch upon in other books if addressed at all. What is new is her own method for combining what is usually seen as two separate systems and a more in depth explanation of information which is more often seen in appendixes.One of the most valuable pieces of advice is in the introduction;take from the book that which resonates with you because tarot is more than a system and ultimately the most unique piece of the puzzle is the reader.
5,Try again,"Another tarot book that is broad and superficial in its treatment, a good review for people with G.'.D.'. background looking for a cliff notes type of manual for tarot attributions. But if you're completely new to tarot, this is not a good starter book. I also think this could've been expanded into a more comprehensive manual. There's lots of good ideas, but some could use more exposition. For example, in the Numeric Dignities chapter, she starts with sets and sequences and then briefly stirs in some modality and elemental effects on the topic. That could and should be a whole separate chapter. I blame the editors for that faux pas. I got the feeling that the publishers threw this together as a pastiche of a larger body of work as an effort to getting out of the red rather than putting out a helpful book on the subject. A worthy author and topic that warrant a little more TLC."
4,Nearly Perfect.,"I really want to give 5 stars to this CD... ""Concierto de Aranjuez"" is extremely well played by John Williams, its also my introduction to his guitar; Very skillful. On the CD, If you are familiar with Aranjuez you'll notice that only first three tracks are related to the title; the rest will also satisfy your music aesthetics to some extent. :-) Overall, the album is extremely dominated by Orchestra that over-shadows the guitar and that is the reason i will not give this CD five stars. My recommendation, Rodrigo played by Paco de Lucia, if you really want to appreciate the work of Rodrigo and undeniable skills of Paco de lucia."
2,didn't work so good,didn't work so good wasn't very dark but they replaced the product and the other one didn't work any better so it may be the old printer that we are using
2,"Cannot recommend for Mozart lovers, but for Gould lovers","I do not feel that this CD set deserves a good recommendation because I believe Gould's rendition of Mozart borders on the idiotic.Each note is clear, but the pacing and distinct pauses between phrases seem completely at odds with what Mozart would have intended.I would give this set away except I worry about wrongly influencing someone else with it, that this represents ""good Mozart"".Instead this is technically precise piano playing but still ""bad Mozart"".I would recommend this set if you are more of a Glenn Gould fan, than a fan of Mozart."
2,"Dub out the vocal chords, keep the piano ones","If you're looking for unadulterated Mozart look elsewhere. The credits on this CD forgot to include Glenn Gould's accompanying voice. Every performance includes his simultaneous, very audible hum-alongs -- very annoying. The occasional clap or cough I could take, but this? Thanks, but no thanks! If I want to hear vocals where Mozart didn't add them I'll listen to The Mozart Sessions."
2,Another GREAT bulldog book!!,"This was good, but if you are bulldog lover, you should definitely try ""Stinky the Bulldog"" by Jackie Valent. It's got a wonderful message for children and adults alike and the illustrations are much better than Gloria's book!"
5,The KYB struts for my Celica GT,"The ride of my car improved 150% with these struts. The rears were very hard to put in (no fault of the strut design), but the fronts took less that 15 minutes each. The car corner flat again and with no fear of the rear end lifting as before. The other struts were just wore out providing no feedback or lane change control."
3,sad,"My husband got this for me as a Mothers day gift. I loved how the Hispanic American Cameo lookd so authentic with amazing attention to detail, from the earrings on the mom, to the expression on the baby's face. However, within 3 months the cameo fell off the holder. I called the company, who replaced it for free, but did not have another Hispanic American cameo. I recieved a regular replacement. I still wear it, and love it, but I am sad that it is not what I origionally ordered."
3,inaccurate?,"I have not read the book yet, I just looked at the preview. It bothers me that there is an inaccuracy in the very beginning of the book, in the timeline of events. Because my husband was killed in the first tower to collapse (Tower 2), I know that the collapse occurred at 9:59 AM, not 10:05. Not a terrible mistake, but it makes me wonder if the rest of the information is reliable. I will probably buy it anyway, to hear about the survivors' experiences."
4,Gripping Reading,This book was very gripping. Some of the stories raised the hair on the back of my neck. We should never forget what happened that awful day. More of these books with survivor stories are needed.
4,Wow...explicit!,"OK so, once again, as has been the case in the rest of the volumes of this series that I have seen, these ladies are pretty far away from being Playboy material. But unlike the others that I have seen, these women actually look pretty good, and some of them really good. Homely faces would be the big drawback.And if anything, this volume is the most explicit yet...and they're all explicit. This is essentially hard-core with deft editing. Some of the solo scenes are actually really hot."
2,PG rated,"This has perhaps the single worst photographed and edited GGW segment I've ever seen. Brynn has a very long segment but the camera never gets below the waist. This would pass local standards in any backwater part of the country, if the locals stayed awake long enough to pass judgment. The other segments are a little better, but overall there is no way I'd recommend this DVD."
5,I Don't Commute & Use Every Day,"Although this works well for the car, my primary use of this machine is for when I want 2 large mugs of well insulated coffee that will stay hot as I drink first mug 1 and then mug 2. I keep the lids on them when not drinking and I've never had the coffee grow cold or even lukewarm. Their most frequent situs is right next to me at my computer station at home. All you need to do is plop 2 tablespoons of coffee plus water in the top, put your mugs underneath and a few minutes later you're ready to start drinking. You can make 1 mug of coffee instead of the 2, using less water and less coffee, but I am always in need of a refill so have not done so. I am tempted to put the machine right in my computer room with me in fact."
2,Get a different model or brand,"The biggest problem I have with this machine is the extremely uneven distribution. Only one time when I made the coffee has it come out equally distributed between the cups, I wondered if the end times were near. Usually one is half full, and the other is overflowing.The construction of it is not very sturdy, so much so I have to pin it down just to turn it on. Otherwise the force needed to turn it on will push it off the table.Finally, it often overflows the filter. If I place the appropriate amount of grinds in the filter to make an acceptably dark coffee, the water flow is choked until it overflows the sides of the filter, sending grinds and water down into and around the coffee mugs. VERY messy and VERY annoying."
2,Stick with a regular coffeemaker,"I've tried this coffemaker a few times and I just don't like it; the coffee comes out weak and bitter-tasting. So then I said ""well, I'll just use the travel mugs"". The bad taste comes from the cups ... I take a great cup of coffee and pour it into the travel mug to go ... instantly bad-tasting. I've washed and re-washed the mugs to no avail."
1,Maddening Fault,"No matter what effort I take, the basket gets clogged every third time I use it. Thinking it's a problem with a clog, I'll clean the basket and even bang it on the sink repeatedly. I'll fill it with water over the sink until it seems to stream out nicely from the holes. I grind the coffee and fill the filter up outside of the basket so I do not wind up spilling grinds. NOTHING WORKS. It spills over when it wants to.I like the concept. I used to like the brand. I strongly dislike this product.Apparently you have to spend hundreds to get a good coffee maker. I have been searching for one for a long time. I still have not found it. This is my second and last Cuisinart. I swear the toys you get at fast food joints are of a higher quality than most coffee makers I have seen. Anyone who paid the retail on this one has my pity."
4,Cup Lids Suck,"This coffee maker rocks. However, the cup lids suck, the lip that the coffee comes out of are either too small or defective. Everytime i try to take a sip, a bubble forms on the lip and traps the coffee. So either you have to pop the bubbles that constantly form or try to take a sip and have the bubble pop and have coffee splash all over your face."
3,handy and useful but...,"1)the handle on the coffee filter basket broke within two weeks use and 2)liquid does not dispense evenly between the two cups. however, it is efficient for brewing water for tea and hot chocolate"
4,"Good enough, but not fast enough.","I bought this since I try to drink coffee before I go to work and bring some to work. I don't think paying $5 a mug of coffee everyday will make my IRA account grow, so making my own is the cheapest way to go. I would have given this a 5 star rating if, the mug is made of plastic so I can warm up my already cold coffee after I get to work. I don't think the microwave would like the aluminum casing. Also, the coffee maker is too darn slow. I had to start making it before I get ready to take a shower or else I will be standing in front of it trying to hurry it up. I need my coffee quick and this is not quick enough. A timer would probably help, don't you think? Overall, for less than $30, it beats making coffee and pouring it in a travel mug only to splash it on yourself while doing it. -bleh"
3,ok coffee maker,"I have had the coffee maker for about 2 months now and recently had the same problem as many others...coffee stopped dripping/water overflowing. I tried to run vinegar through it hoping that would clean it and fix the problem. It didn't. I discovered that if you take the basket out and flip it over, there are 2 screws holding the water diverter in place. Unscrew the screws and put the diverter aside. There is a small hole on the bottom of the basket (mine was clogged with a few coffee grounds). I used a toothpick to clean out the hole, then decided to make the hole a little bigger. I put it all back together and it has worked fine ever since. If I have the problem again, I may make the hole even bigger and just leave the diverter off to brew only 1 cup at a time."
4,Very good.,"I've only had it a few days and used it a few times, so far I am very happy with it. Easy to use and makes a good mug of coffee (or two). Unless you want to make a whole lot at once, or you want a timer, it's just the thing."
3,No shut off when done.,Have had for a couple of weeks. Liked the idea of a one or two cup coffee brewer. Makes decent coffee. My biggest gripe is that coffee keeps coming out (dripping) once you remove the cup. It makes a bit of a mess when you are in a hurry.
3,"Great coffee, why did they increase the price from $25?","This maker makes great coffee once you get a gold cup screen. Finding a 2-cup gold mesh filter is very difficult, so add it to your online order. I've had mine for many years. It makes excellent coffee. Why other makers just make hot tasteless liquid, I don't know. The cup lids are a pain to get on and off, but don't leak. The plastic inserts will come out sooner or later, then you're stuck tryng to press them back in every other use or so.I can't believe the price is $85 though. I bought it when they had it as their daily sale. I would not pay $85 for this. The quality is just not there."
1,Horrible Mess,I hated this coffee maker. It made a mess every time I tried to use it--partly filling one cup and over filling the other. I finally chucked it and bought 2 single cup makers from Black & Decker. The only thing I saved from it was the actual travel mugs. Don't buy this.
4,Perfect for those who have a cup of coffee each morning,"I have had this coffee maker for more than 5 years now and love it. I make coffee every morning with it and it's been completly reliable every single day. Don't buy this if you think you want coffee for more than 2 people. However, for one or two people, this can make up to two 16oz cups of coffee.Mostly, I just make a single cup. To make only one cup, simply put your coffee mug right in the center. To make two cups, offset them like shown in the picture for the item. Recommendation: Do not use finely ground coffee grounds, they can stop up the drip tray, set your grinder for just larger than medium grounds.Pros:just the right amount of cofee without wasting groundsfast: It only takes a few minutes for a single cupcomes with two great mugsCould be improved:Sometimes one cup has more coffee than the other due to the bifricated drip trayThere is no timer"
4,"Good but to go mugs are just ""okay.""","We had a unit like this previously. It had two baskets so you could make two cups with two different kinds of coffee. ie, one decaf, one regular. With this one there is one basket. You can still make 2 cups or 1 cup but you must use the same coffee. Not a huge issue. The Cuisinart mugs are just ""okay"" so we use the ones from our previous unit which was not a Cusinart and this works fine. The quality of the coffee that is brewed is good."
4,Two-to-Go Coffeemaker,"Purchased it to replace my old one which started leaking, and this one is a slimmer design which i like, and fits nicely on my kitchen counter. Like the fact that I can take the tumbler with me to work, reasonably priced."
1,Buyer Beware,"I really wish I could give this product no stars. I'm not really the person to freak over just little defect of a product. But this didn't even work! I bought one and brought it home and the on switch didn't work. Tried about 20 different plugs in my house and one of my surge protectors still didn't work. Took it back to the store and bought another one and that one didn't work either, I just went ahead and bought one for a higher price. The on switch is defective and it really is the luck of the draw if it works or not."
5,Two to Go,"I just love the Two-to-go Coffee Maker. It makes coffee quickly and just enough with one container. If I want more, I just use two containers. It is my second of it's kind and hope there will be another, when I wear this one out.Sally SueCuisinart TTG-500 Two-to-Go Coffeemaker"
5,Awesome Coffee Maker,This is the second of these I have purchased. One for my office and one for my home. The first one is still making like a champ. It produces great tasting coffee and is easy to get on the road quickly in the morning. Would highly recommend this item.
5,Love this!,This is a great product for people on the go. Coffee goes staight into your cup and then straigt into the dishwashwer when you are finished.
4,coffee two,The compact style is perfect for countertops. The unit make great hot coffee. I use it for a single cup and it works great. I also like that it shuts off right after the brewing is done.
2,great idea that does not stand the test of time,"I received this as an Xmas gift, and was initially overjoyed. It worked quite well for about 1 month, and was very convenient. After about 1 month of daily use, the on/off switch began to fail. Now, after 1 1/2 months, the machine is unusable, as it may turn itself off during the brewing process, (I may have to hit the on switch 7-10 times to brew a cup of coffee). Now instead of being very convenient, if you don't hover over it, it will shut off. Something as basic as an on/of switch should not fail. What good is that?"
1,Great for six whole months!,"We bought this as a Christmas present to ourselves and loved it except for the occasional overflows (problem stopped when we bought a better coffee grinder). Then, after six months, it stopped working - the start button wouldn't depress. Cuisinart was willing to replace it, if we paid approximately $10 to ship it to them and another $10 for shipping of the replacement to us. Another $20 for a machine that was only 6 months old? Unbelievable..."
2,Fast but messy,"My mother-in-law has this Coffeemaker and hasn't had much luck with it since she got it. It's great if you're only making one cup. But when using both cups the separated drip mechanism doens't do the job it's designed to do at first. Once the coffee begins a steady flow, it works well. But initial flow is not heavy enough for the bead of liquid to separate, thus resulting with a counter top full of coffee. Other than the mess...the coffee is ready in minutes and tastes great."
5,A Great Idea and a Great Coffee Maker!,"This really intrigued me and I was worried that it was just a gadget that would become unused and ignored. I was wrong! What a great idea that really makes great coffee -- and QUICK! The cups clean really well and the handy idea of making it directly into the travel mugs, allows you to put cream and/or sugar in the cup before brewing -- thus allowing for even more time savings! FAB!"
3,"Simple and Cheap, Slow and Messy","Overall this product works as advertised.--Tends to splatter and if you don't have the cup aligned rite it will make a huge mess.--Very slow to make a cup of coffee++It is compact, simple, looks good and is easy to clean.Be sure to ask yourself ""do I really only drink one cup"". I though I did, but then I realized that I often went back for seconds."
1,Not a good experience,"Based on the other high reviews, it seems this may very well be a great coffeemaker. Unfortunately, my experience with two of these machines was not good. Both were defective.I returned the first machine because it would not hold water. It gushed OUT of the bottom of the unit. I returned the replacement machine because it had the opposite problem -- the water stayed IN the unit. I was not inclined to try it a third time so I opted for a different brand & model.I do think this was a fluke. Cuisinart is usually a very reliable brand. My experience, although frustrating (and I really hate re-packaging things and standing in line at the post office to return them), was not terrible. I would not let this sour my opinion or decline to try other products from them in the future."
5,Gets the job done,There really isn't much to say. The cost of the product is more than fair. It brews tea/coffee at the perfect temp. and the mugs that come with it keep the liquid hot for up to two hours! Perfect for single/couples.AdamIowa
5,great buy!,"I think that it is an excellent coffeemaker for the money. The mug is insulated so its keeps the coffee warm long enough. It brews rather quickly. It doesn't dribble contrary to what another reviewer wrote. It is very easy to use and clean. Very compact.. great for small apartments. Best of all, you don't need to wash the carafe for it has none....really convenient!"
5,Great coffee to go!,"Brew your coffee right into the cups. You can even put the lids on, so you just grab it and go!"
3,product ok,"After, what I thought, was a lot of research I decided on the cuisinart two go coffeemaker. It does what it says it does with the exception of the mugs. When the coffee first drips into the mugs they are almost to hot to handle and they are the only mugs that fit under the spouts. I was very disappointed to find this out. But I suppose what do you want for so little money. Just make sure that you don't break them or lose them."
4,Convenient and fast,"I love this coffee maker and have saved loads of money at the espresso stand. The cups do get a bit hot on the outside and the rubber rings are thin and not much good for insulation. The cups fill unevenly with mine, but not as much as someone else said. There's probably about an inch of difference in the amount of coffee in each cup. The basket for the filter is a pretty neat feature, and everything is easy to clean. I'd definitely recommend it for someone who likes to take their coffee to work with them."
1,Doesn't work,"We purchased this item and the idea is great two working people getting ready for work. We kept it in our master bath. It worked great for about the first ten times and then got clogged up, overflowed and ruined a carpet. I cleaned the clogged holes and it worked about three more times before overflowing again. This happened three times and I finally returned it to the store where I purchased it. Could not get my money back but got store credit. It'sa shame because we liked the idea and would have kept it if it worked."
4,Great buy.,"For the price that Amazon is selling this product, this is a great buy. This was a perfect addition to my dorm room because of its compact size, and I love the sleek look.Initially, I was quite disappointed that the lid to the travel mug didn't have an open/close spout, since I had wanted something I could throw in my bag with coffee inside of it. However, I've realized that carrying the mug to class, having a nice cup of coffee or tea that stays warm for a few hours, then throwing it in my bag when I'm done is just as good. (Besides, I've been told that there are very few travel mugs out there that are truly spill-proof, and for that you'd have to shell out a great deal of money.)I've gotten lots of compliments on the travel mug, which does take a little bit of getting used to drinking out of. It seems to me that if you fill it up not too full (maybe 3/4), then it's easier to drink out of. But overall, I've been very satisfied with this product."
1,"If you love coffee, don't buy this one!","This coffeemaker is compact and handy for making fresh single cups of coffee. However, I had one for about a year at work and it always added a very bad plastic taste to the coffee. I cleaned it several times and used my own mug, and the taste got a little better over time. But it still made the coffee ""plastic"". I finally got a basically free brewer from Gevalia and my coffee tastes great again."
1,One big mess,"My husband and I received this coffee maker a little over a week ago. Tried it 4 times. Of the 4 times we used it, it leaked all over the counter and floor twice. A hot mess to clean up. Disaster of a coffee maker. Never seen anything like it, and we've made alot of coffee in our lives, it's not like we're new to making coffee. The travel mugs aren't bad but a bit of a steep price to pay for two travel mugs. Will try to find another brand with a better design. Shocked at how bad this Cuisinart performed. They usually do a much better job than this. I would keep shopping and locate another model. Unless you like hot coffee squirted all over your kitchen first thing in the morning!"
2,"Nice mugs, bad coffee maker","I bought this item because it didn't have an external burner, and I wanted a machine that would be safe for my desk at work. It was on sale for $20 at the time, which is actually a deal for the thermal mugs. As expected, the coffee maker was not very good, but it did the job. Until it broke, three weeks after I bought it. The water no longer moved through the chamber, so I wound up with a lot of noise and steam and very little coffee. I returned it to the store. I think I will have to switch back to a (nearly unbreakable) Bodum french press."
2,Not what we expected,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. It now sits unused, taking up counter space. The pluses are that it makes tolerable coffee, it is fairly easy to use, and the two cups fill up almost equally. The down side, that makes it unusable for us, is that there is no keep warm function (not possible with this design), the plastic coffee mugs (no handles) are clad in stainless sheet metal thus obviating putting them in the microwave to reheat, and lastly, there is a propensity to ""dribble"" when drinking from these mugs."
2,doesnt work,"we purchased this coffee for two at a discount store, no box or instructions. the water gets hot but does not come down to the cups. since i lost the reciept i cant take it back. did anyone else have a problem with theirs not working?"
2,Passing,I bought this coffee maker because I am the only coffee drinker in the home and one cup is normally enough for me. The quality and taste of the coffee is fair at best. I normally have to microwave the water before adding it to the maker to get the coffee hot enough for my enjoyment. The heating element just doesn't get cold water to the proper temperature. All in all this coffee maker is just passing enough to enjoy a blah cup of joe on weekends. I will be in the market for another model soon.
4,"1,2,3",and your ready to have coffee and that works just great for me. I like a fresh cup of coffeee in the morning and didn't want to make a full pot because the rest would go to waste. This is perfect for people on the go.
2,Did Not Meet My Expectations,"The Two-to-Go Coffeemaker worked fine for the first few weeks of heavy use but by the third week, the machine was only making about enough coffee to fill one of the containers. We believe that grounds may have gotten in the drip device which lays right ontop of the grounds and is part and parcel of what I believe to be a bad design. When it was working right, it produced a great cup of coffee, but now it will soon be replaced."
2,ON/OFF Switch goes defective after return period,"Hey, this Cuisinart appeared to be just the ticket for two people who needed coffee at the same time, and on the go. But as someone else noted, the ON/OFF switch went south and would stop brewing. Only after repeatedly hitting the switch approximately 5 times could I get some coffee brewed. I could live with the cup on the right filling up sooner than the left; I ended up transferring the excess coffee from one to the other. At least I got 90 days of use out of it, twice as much as another reviewer."
3,Wait to go...,"I think the one thing that is lacking from this product is an automatic timer. Designed for some one on the go, it would be nice to have the coffee already brewed so that after getting ready in the morning it's there waiting to be grabbed before heading out the door, rather than having to wait for it."
1,Power on switch failed,"After having the unit less than a year the power on button no longer works. Cuisinart will fix it under warrenty for $10 but after you add shipping, you might as well buy something else."
4,"Love this, but no dishwasher","I LOVE this little coffee maker since my husband doesn't drink coffee, I can just make one cup TO GO! However, the mugs/cups don't go in the dishwasher, hate that - but not enough to stop using it! (Update 12/09: STILL using these same two mugs after 3 years!!! I still love this since I am the only coffee drinker, but I have to say that I wish I would've purchased one of the bigger sets that can either house a karafe or travel mugs for when company comes over to the house)"
2,Good only for about 9 months!,"Reecived this as a Christmas present last year, but it took two months of moving before I could actually use it. Once I did, the travel mugs lasted about a week before the bottoms came off and they had to be thrown away due to rough bottom edges. No big deal I thought, I will just use other travel mugs. That lasted for about six months. The coffee it brews is HORRIBLE tasting! I have ran the ""residue cleaners"" through it, like all my past coffeemakers, and it just won't come back to its days of making a decent cup of coffee. Too bad I had a convenient coffeemaker for about 9 months!"
2,Not the greatest,"I bought two of these - one for me, one for my mother. She loves her's but I find mine is a pain in the a**. The filter/cup alignment on this java maker is poor. The cone often james and is difficult to clean."
1,Horrible.,"I received this as a Christmas gift and I have tried my best to make a decent cup of coffee out of this thing. I have tried different brands of coffee, different sweetner, cream, more cream, less cream, any combination - you name it, I've tried it and it always comes out the same: watery and bitter. So, 7 months later I have finally called it quits. I just ordered a Braun KF180-BLK FlavorSelect 12-Cup Coffeemaker through Amazon and I have my fingers crossed. All I ask is for a decent cup of coffee in the morning! Once this new machine comes in I'll rate it and give you my view...hopefully it's positive."
1,Lasted 2 months,"I would've given it 4 stars. 5 had the on button not been really hard to push when I got it. But I bought it April 13th and it was dead June 15th. I'm getting a replacement but I am out shipping the original, shipping it back, and a $5 charge to get the replacement at 7-10 days shipping.Waiting to see if I get a new one."
1,not good!,"I have had this coffee maker for 3 years. It have problem some time, like brew cold coffee, not working and don't drip coffee from filter. I am about to say bye to it."
1,Very disappointing,This looked like a good idea for coffee making. It arrived and did not work at all. The switch-button to turn it on is very flimsy and would not turn the machine on. I had to call Amazon (always very cooperative) and pack it all back up and send it back. I would not order this machine again because of the poor design of the on/off button.
4,Perfect except...... Dishwasher safe?,"I would love to give this product 5 stars, but I am sort of peeved at the lack of truthfulness in the product description here. I specifically searched for a maker such as this that had dishwasher safe mugs as I spend more time cleaning the mugs for use every day than it takes to make the two cups of coffee. When I first got them and read the instructions, I was a little put out. So I searched again and found that none of the ones included dishwasher safe cups. I decided to try the machine and see if it was worth the price and hassle. I was indeed! Also, now that i have read another review here and found that i can use other mugs with this maker, I am more happy than ever! I will run out and buy new travel mugs for every day use so that I don't ever have to hand wash again! I am very picky about my coffee, and this machine brews excellent coffee!"
2,Coffeemaker,I purchased this for my husband and I. It only worked a short while and seemed to be clogged up. I have tried to clean it profusely and have been unable to get it to work any more.
3,Makes good coffee but needs work,I've used this product for some time now. About two months after I bought it the little pivoting plastic handle on the coffee basket broke. I contacted Cuisinart who sent me another basket. After a couple months that one broke too. I ended up tying a piece of mono filament fishing line to the top of the basket which has been working ever since. Cuisinart needs to improve this design. While they are at it...I would prefer a mug with no metal on it so I could put it in the microwave and zap it for a couple seconds after adding cold creamer. It makes pretty good coffee though. The other reviewers are correct; the two cups do not fill equally.
5,Rousing Tale of the Sea,"This seafarer's memoir records with accuracy and great detail a critical period of time in commercial shipping. This decade leading up to and during World War II was filled with nautical adventure as seen through the eyes of a very young man whose voyages take us through the Suez Canal to India to Japan to Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope. His shipmates are, for better or worse, unforgettable characters. This is a great read for those who love the sea!"
5,Gripping Materpiece,I couldn't put the book down. Extremely well written and simply a chilling story. I hope it is adapted for the bigscreen.
3,Decent-but not well organized,"Like the German language, this grammar book is very unorganized. Maybe this is an artistic attempt to capture the essence of the German language, but it is quite unhelpful for reference. Don't expect much vocab either; and that which is included is either obvious or not useful..."
5,Complete grammar review,"For an intermediate German student who needs to revise grammar, this is an easy to follow book with concise explanations and good exercises. Also, each chapter includes new words and, especially helpful, idioms which one would not find in a dictionary. This is not for a beginner, nor for someone fluent in German."
3,2nd Edition Over This Third Edition 3:1,"The reviews printed here (other than this one) appear to refer to the 2nd not 3rd edition. Whenever a ""second author"" pops up on an edition of a successful one-author book, it almost invariably indicates the book had to be ""more user friendly"" or ""more accessible"" and other triple speak phrases. At least in this case the page count went down instead of doubling and the price decreased instead of doubling to tripling (as in calculus books for example). It reflects the drive to make SAT tests easier to bring up the scores, pass every one to avoid complaints and put in more and prettier graphics to ""attract"" the student. The third editon has less depth and fewer real exercises. Shade! It remains however a highly useful book; although my own feeling is that it ranks below a MUCH cheaper Schaums Outline, ""German Grammer"""
5,EXCELLENT,"I was a total biginner of German, who didn't even know what 'Guten Tag' meant. But I learned German grammer by myself with this book literally in two months, and after a year of German self-teaching, I got an internship offer in Germany (of course conducted in German). Now I have no problem conversing with German people. I strongly recommend this book."
3,I prefer the Second Edition,"Although this is a decent intermediate German Grammar book, and in fact one of the best currently available, the penultimate edition was vastly superior, in my opinion. There were more and better exercises, and I felt that the coverage of every point was really thorough--to the point of being German. This version seems by contrast a bit dilute. Nonetheless, I am sure that the lighter weight of this edition will be appreciated by those who have too much stuff to schlepp around in their backpacks."
5,Great Radio,"Bought this deck because of the price and the reviews. I have also had a dual deck before and was happy with it. This deck is LEGIT, and for the price you can't beat it. Great sound, awesome features. Built in Bluetooth?!? Thats usually around $100 extra for decks that are already more expensive. Switches to phone when the phone rings no matter what mode the deck is in, AND, I use my phone as an mp3 player, I have a ton of songs on it, the deck can play music from my phone via bluetooth!!! That's pretty cool. I would recommend this deck to ANYONE looking for a great deck for an AMAZING price..."
1,Do not buy it,"First, the remote control never worked, then after 3 days bluetooth stoped working, and usb mode make some noise when you are listening music from your ipod.Don't waste yor money!!!"
4,Given as a gift to my husband.,Great price but it cost as much to install as I paid for it. My husband needed a new radio for his car to play his MP3's and he picked out this one and I got it for Christmas.
4,Excellent features for the cost.,"Everything on this radio works as should. Bluetooth is flawless. Sound quality is amazing, compared to my stock Harman Kardon BMW radio.There are just a couple cons.1.) To make calls through radio, you have to dial the number directly. The radio will not scroll through your contacts. However, with new phones, voice dialing, or dialing through the phone is just as easy.2.) There are no other display color options, only blue. This is very minor, but the other one I was looking at could.It boils down to I could not justify paying $70 more for another radio that did have the above minor features. Everything else is still there. I would recommend this radio to anyone."
4,Decent Product,"Remote came with weak battery, but unit worked fine till it got really hot outside, which caused the volume knob to not operate correctly. The cold weather seems to allow the knob to work better. I am assuming that the variable resistor of the knob just needs to be soldered better for a better connection. Unit works though. The bluetooth feature is a plus and very clear throught the speakers. The sub woofer inputs are great with an amplifier. Really add bass to the vehicle with great and clear sound."
1,Deeply regret purchasing,"I purchased this with the necessary kit to install for my 2006 Toyota Corolla. I can't seem to get AM stereo channels even when I properly installed all the connections. The face plate keeps popping out on speed bumps. Sometimes it's even difficult to remove the face plate. I get the feeling that all the materials that was used to make this were all flimsy. Sound quality is horrible. I believe there's a reason why the Kenwoods and the Alpine stereos cost as much as they do. My advice, save your money for a higher end stereo. During a long drive, great audio quality is way more valuable than a thrift purchase."
1,Do not buy this POS,We bought this stereo because we wanted something cheap for my convertible. Not 6 months later it was causing my car battery to drain completely. We wrote to Dual asking for information on the warranty and have heard nothing. Now the iPod cable doesn't work and the CD player is going out as well.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! Broken in three months,"I bought this Dual XDMA6415 less than three months ago. At first it worked fine but even after the first couple weeks, I started noticing problems. It became fuzzy sounding and the bluetooth stopped connecting. My iPod stopped charging and I replaced the chord twice with no results. After checking the wiring and the device, there is no connection problems. Now the radio does not function at all, nor does anything else for that matter.I emailed the company about the 1 year limited warranty and after three weeks, never received a response. I called the contact number listed and I can never speak with an actual person. I am really disappointed with amazon, because they should not be selling a product with such a sketchy service warranty. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have spent the extra cash instead of wasting it down the drain with this piece of crap.The warranty info if you are interested:[...]"
1,HORRIBLE product and service!,"This radio is awful. Did not work straight out of the box. I had to keep sending broken parts to the company at my expense, and still didn't work right. Dual would not replace at their expense. I have spent a lot of time on the phone and writing emails. VERY FRUSTRATING. Amazon customer support is great, though, and has resolved my issues. I do not recommend this radio or Dual, however."
1,This worked great!!!!,"For a week and a half. After that, the speakers started cracking and were extremely distorted. On volume level 1..........Plugged the old stock car stereo back in and the speakers were fine.Amazon refunded the money in a timely manner though."
3,Bluetooth is fuzzy - only an okay car stereo.,"Although it's a great price on Amazon, I'd spend the extra $40 and get yourself a decent car stereo.I installed this in my 2000 Toyota 4Runner with stock speakers and a 10"" Kicker sub/200w amp. Althought it does the job, it doesn't do it with any real impact. It creates sound, and it functions, but don't expect amazing sound.The biggest disappointment was the bluetooth performance. Although it's got all the phone gadgets, and includes a microphone, the connection with both my Android, iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 were all fuzzy. Yup - the louder you pumped the volume the louder the bluetooth fuzz was! It was really distracting, almost like using a tape deck aux converter. It's just poor quality.I used it for about 8 months, but finally gave in and purchased a decent Pioneer unit that has crystal clear bluetooth connectivity, and much better control over stock speaker sound.Just spend the extra money. Trust me."
1,I owned this for one year now; do not purchase,"This head unit was great for the first 6 months or so that I owned it. Now it's just a glitching mess. It actually almost killed me. When I turn the volume knob down from say 15 to 10, it will randomly jump up all the way to 40! This is unbearably loud and probably has done damage to my ears as well as my speakers. It also glitches when you press the center button(on the knob) to access the audio controls; it will randomly just start jumping track if using a cd and if not using a cd, it will just switch the mode to radio or aux. I am contacting dual's warranty department as it has been a couple months shy of a year since I've owned it but this is just a cheaply made, not so cheap in cost, terrible product. Do not buy this product. If you do think that maybe you'll be lucky and get one that won't crap out on you in 6 months, be warned that you're taking a huge risk."
4,Not a better bang for the buck,"Installation was pretty straight forward. The overall quality of the deck is as expected, and the bluetooth feature works. I use bluetooth music streaming for short distances as it is a little staticy. Great quality when plugged into Aux. The phone portion of the bluetooth is sketchy but works. People say they can't hear me too well but it gets the job done. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase at the price point given.Rock on Amazon."
4,Good value,This unit has alot of features for the money. Blue tooth works well and the unit was delivered on time. I upgraded my stock system and for sixty dollars I feel I got a great value. Sound is good and the capabilities are great. In am happy and feel this unit matches up with units that cost double this one.
2,Spend the Extra 20 Bucks to get a better brand name. . .,"Unit showed up, installed easily and powered up. Quality is low. Display is cheap, buttons are cheap. Overall appearance is ok. Sound quality for bluetooth streaming is horrible, and overall sound quality. . well my stock suzuki stereo sounded much better.If It wasn't work to take it out I would. When I upgrade to include amplification and possibly a subwoofer, I will throw out this unit, I wouldn't even sell it to someone as I'd feel bad for making them have to use it."
1,"Worked great the first day, not at all the second day.","The title pretty much explains it all, I bought the deck, my brother and I installed it. My brother has put in dozens of these before and this time was no different, we got everything working and the next day it just didn't work, we tried troubleshooting everything we could to fix it. It had some weird glitch where as soon as it was turned on, it would crank up the volume by itself. That went on for a week or so, then it stopped working all together. The few minutes I got to use it, it sounded fine but unfortunately I was unable to return it in time to get a replacement or a refund. My fault completely but still a little bit of a bummer. Now I have a metal brick in where a stereo should be."
5,good bang for the buck,"just installed this today, i gotta say im impressed. now this is no high tech radio but its a radio that has all the necessary functions. comes with ipod cable which i haven't used yet but according to the manual you can control everything from the radio. this unit has Bluetooth which i did use and works great, other end of the call said they heard me just fine, was a breeze to pair my phone. sound quality is great i would definitely recommend this bad boy."
2,Burnt out in 1 week,"Worked right out of the box. Easy installation, and great features! Bluetooth syncing wasn't too bad either. I had a chance to test out just about all the features this stereo had to offer, and it all seemed to work just fine.About a week after installation and moderate use, I caught a whiff of burnt electrical components. I thought it might have someone burning trash as I drove past some houses. The next time I turned on my truck, no sound came out of the speakers. I checked all fuses, connections, and spent a few hours trying to find out anything that was wrong. Just as a sanity check, I plugged my old stereo back into the truck to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with the truck hardware. Sure enough, the old device worked fine. The Dual stereo system was defective. Returning to Amazon for a refund."
3,Bluetooth died,"Bought on April 3, shipped April 7th, received probably a few days after that, so XDMA6415 was installed probably around April 10-14. Everything works / worked great, except Bluetooth died about a month ago, sometime in July (so about 3 months after purchase).Requested a return, sent in the unit and received a XDMA6630 instead. Hopefully it lasts this time around.Additional info:Unit installed in 2003 Nissan Altima.Bluetooth routed underneath steering wheel and through A pillar to visor area.Stereo reception is pretty good, I would recommend this unit if not for the Bluetooth dying."
4,Great functions (but has limitations),"I love the fact that once I put the key into the ignition, I don't have to think about setting my Bluetooth for my phone, it is automatic (especially when the phone rings). Also I love the audio input feature, which lets my android to play the tracks. However, when placing a flash-drive, the radio will read it and play it; however the name of the file will not appear on the radio screen; instead, the tracks will be labeled as ""Track-1, track-2, track-3 and so on. So I guess you will hear the tracks into alphabetical sequence not knowing their names or been able to jump to your favorite file since you cannot read the ""real name."" Many more pluses than minuses, I am really happy overall."
2,alright stereo,"i bought this stereo a lil bit ago because i wanted an aux port and usb port for my ipod in my car. as well as a lil extra power than i already had in my car. it sais that it is 200 watts but thats only max output. it really only puts out 17 watts rms. THATS NOTHING. i hav to turn the volume up to 25 to get any bass outta my speakers wat so ever and i hav some really good speakers. and thats only with my ipod. wen i play the stereo, i hav to turn the volume up to 35 to make it sound even somewat good. deffinately buy an amp cuz this thing just wont do it. good stereo for its features but the power is next to nothing"
2,I would have kept my old one.,"I bought it for the Bluetooth and for the price. Do not expect a lot from it. When I browse through the USB mp3 files, it actually shows the commands like parent directory or folder, like in DOS in Windows OS, which is disappointing. The BT works ok. You must know a qualified person to install the car stereo with mic."
2,Lasted 6 months,"I have had this car stereo for about 6 months and today when I pushed a button to change the radio station, the face popped off. The plastic pieces that grip the face and hold it in place have broken off. I have only taken the face off one time in the six months I have had the stereo, so this could not be from overuse. Until that time everything worked as it should. The sound quality was not as good as my factory stereo had been, but was okay."
1,skips on every LITTLE bump,"Got this little gem installed at car toys 2 days ago. Cd's skip over the smallest bumps in the road. Skips on the highway. Skips pulling in any kind of driveway. Skips non stop....skips, skips, skips....buy something else. For the price of this plus ($130) installation, I could have gotten an alpine with free installation."
1,Awful,"First this radio has a horrible interface and that's the least of the problems with this thing. The faceplate doesn't stay on. Every source has an awful hum in the background that actually will give you a headache and overpowers the actual music. The two promising aspects of this unit the Bluetooth and iPod control were ruined by this hum. Customer service through DualAV is awful they wanted me to mail this to them at my own expense then they would mail another. I just felt this unit had way to many flaws and forked over a little bit of extra money to get a radio with the features this one is suppose to have plus a few more. I am promptly returning this lemon to Amazon,"
1,Do not buy,"I bought this receiver in the spring of 2011. In the Summer of 2012, just after the 1 year warranty expired, the volume knob began going on the fritz. At this point the volume knob is almost completely unusable, often changing the volume level to completely random values, up or down, any time the knob is touched, the faceplate is bumped, a key is pressed or even if I hit a bump in the road. I called tech support and the best they can do is ship me a replacement faceplate for $33.50, which comes with a 3 month warranty. No thanks, I'll buy a different radio once I finally lose patience and put my fist through this one.This is a very cheaply made product and you get even less than what you pay for. Don't expect it to last very long."
2,Do not buy,"I have tried and tried to get Bluetooth to connect, I have tried 3 different phones, no luck. I have done everything the user guide has said to do. I would say I got what I paid for."
1,I hate it really lost money,"Bluetooth not work after 2 week using, I really want return and get my money back, radio bad signal always"
4,NIce deck can not beat features vs price,Great deck for the price. Bluetooth works great and the external mic makes you sound good with hands free. Good buy
3,Cute but Cheaply Made,"This shelf looks adorable, but don't plan on buying it if you wish to actually hang anything on it. I bought everything in Froggy Tales, and this is one of the only things I'm sending back. We all want cute things for our babies, but this is an unnecessary, useless item."
5,"Awesome,meditative, inspirational.",This is the first album by avalon that I have been priviledged to listen to. It is wonderful. '' Can't live a day'' is the best song I've listened to lately. Never knew that gospel music could be this good.
5,I am so thankful for this CD! Anointed by the Lord!,"""Can't Live A Day"" has ministered to me so much! It is the cry of my heart expressed in awesome words and music! ""Speechless"" is profound! All the songs speak to some aspect of my Christian walk today! The Lord has really used the whole CD to bless me and help me to enter into His presence regularly! Thank you Avalon! Thank You Jesus!"
5,It's a AWESOME Cd,"The very first time I bought the cd I thought it wasnt good at all. But now I like all the songs. I think my favorite songs are Take You At Your Word, and In it not of, and of course In A Diffrent Light. I think that they have been a great ministry. Each song has a message. God has blessed them with wonderful talents. So if you just want to talk about the cd e~mail me. You should get the cd. If you dont your loosing out."
4,Avalon,An older album of Avalon's music. Sweet sounds and great to listen to and sing along. It arrived in the exact condition as described.
5,Avalon has done it again,"This album is great from start to finish. I had been looking forward to A Different Light's release and I am not disappointed. This CD is very fast paced and has alot of energy. I just got it today and can't pick a favorite song yet. Buy it, it's great!!!!!!"
5,Avalon is my favorite artist!!,"i love avalons music! My favorite song is Take You At Your Word. they have the greatest songs ever.These are the best songs to me. take you at your word,cant live aday,testify to love,and a lot more."
2,Haven't we heard this before?,"Take Abba, give them a culturally inept producer from the 90s, put them ALL on your favorite version of ""happy pills"" and valium at once. There you go, it's Avalon. Lyrics are shallow, music is -at best- a Christian-keyboard version of pop music, and the picutres make Ned Flanders look dark. The claim to want to be ""in, not of"" while making music ""not in, not of."" Avalon guys and girls, I KNOW you've got talent, when given the chance you can do some good stuff. But please listen to music not written by happy-happy-joy-joy Christians for a little while. It'll stretch your art."
2,Dont waste your money,These are not worth the money. Not close to sounding original and I wish I has spent money on other choices not this set
5,great easyread keyboard,this is the second of these I've bought......first one got 'beyond cleaning' after several years. easy to see and use.
5,easy and fun to knit,"this is a great book for those who have a bit of time to knit and create. It can take more time if you wish, meaning the more stuff you WANT to do and the more time you want to invest, DO IT. For those who just want a fun semi-quick hand made 'lovie"" as my grand daughter says, it's a great project book. If you want to add beads, buttons, flowers, and so much more, it's just the time that you want to put into it. I will be knitting these dolls for years to come."
2,Not my favorite,"I have listened to a lot of music intended to soothe anxious dogs and this is my least favorite CD. The smooth professional full-orchestra sound of the Mozart seems to clash with the nature sounds. Moreover, the nature sounds seem to be tacked on top of the music without any harmony; it just didn't sound 'natural'. Most of the music was too fast-paced to be soothing. The nature sounds consist mostly of birds tweeting, which I found high pitched and stressful, and flowing water, which I thought was static on my stereo the first few times I heard it. My dogs get up and pace around when it plays and my room-mate, who has never complained about my music before, asked me to turn it off. There is a lot of better music available to soothe dogs."
3,Sounds good,I don't know if the music helps my dog or not but it makes me feel better that I am leaving her in a more soothing environment.
2,"Great songs, shoddy collection","What's missing: 'Mama Kin', 'Train Kept A-Rollin', 'Seasons Of Wither', 'Toys In The Attic', 'Chip Away The Stone', 'No Suprise'. What's annoying: some songs, like 'Sweet Emotion', 'Same Old Song And Dance', and a few others, are edited for time. I hate that! So in effect, these aren't even the songs we've come to know and love. Get the recent double-disc Oh Yeah! compilation instead."
1,Rip off - Do Not Buy,"Imagine somebody took your favorite album and cut out parts of the music and altered it, so that it no longer resembled the original. That is what they have done here.I don't know why the band allowed the release of this collection. Maybe they had no control over it.All I can say is buy only the original recordings and don't trust collections like these. If you do you will lose and wind up buying the original recordings."
4,Dreamin On,"One of the few greatest hits CDs I would get. Worth the price for the version of ""Dream On"", where you can hear a marked difference in the quality of Steven Tylers voice."
3,Just didnt have all the songs I was looking for,Audio quality was fantastic but it just didnt have all the songs I was looking for. Thats mostly my fault though for not researching this further before purchase. I havent listened to this album as much do to this.
5,This Rocks!!!,This is a great CD with all of the MUST HAVE hits that Aerosmith has had over the years. I am a big fan and I highly recommend this CD!!
2,Not so great,"Possibly the worst thing ever done to Aerosmith's music. A collection of their radio top forty songs. A lot of good music, but cut to fit on a lp. A lot of the songs are edited, and most tragic of these is Sweet emotion. The unique intro and the awesome outro jam are missing. When I converted my Asmith collection to cd I bought this just to say I have it. But in five years I have not even taken it out of the wrapper yet. If your an 'smith fan, don't waste your time."
2,"Great Songs, but...","Great songs, but, come on! this is a Greatest Hits CD, and theres 37 minutes of music... There should be at least 15 songs on here. Not 10. Yeah, theres classics on here, Dream on, Same Old Song and Dance, Walk This Way, Remember (Walking in the sand), and a good Beatles cover of Come Together. But I'm reviewing the CD. Not enough songs. Look for other Best Of Aerosmith's."
1,Very disappointing for a guy who like Aerosmith,"I have heard Aerosmith on the radio. I have heard Aerosmith on the ""ARMAGEDDON"" soundtrack. But those songs which caused me to actually LIKE Aerosmith have been butchered on this ""Greatest Hits"" CD. I don't know if the band members even approved of this album, because if I were in a band making great music, and somebody edited it to the nth degree, I don't think I'd like it too much. Don't buy it."
5,First In My Collection,"This may not be their first album, but it was the first album of theirs that I bought. I found this one at CVS for ten bucks, alogn with their GET A GRIP album, which I bought a few days later. I all but played mine to pieces - I gotta get a CD repair kit for mine. This is a great album for anyone who is starting their collection of Aerosmith albums, because you get a nice sample of their earlier albums. I would say if you want to get addicted to Aerosmith (and who wouldln't), this would be a good place to start. And if John Lennon was alive today and heard Steven singing ""Come Together"", he'd be proud. These guys definitely stay true to The Beatles' vibe on thsi song, yet somehow add their own bluesy flavor to it. I don't think you'll find a better GREATEST HITS album than this one - buy it, bting it home, and PLAY IT LOUD!!"
5,Aerosmith - my favorite band!!,Love Aerosmith and love these classic hits that never get old!! A really nice collection of some of their very best hits. Love it!!
4,Areosmith is back.,"Remember those hit songs from the 70's you used to listen to? Areosmith is back in there greatest hits cd, big lips and big Rock and Roll. Includes the ubiquitous Walk This Way (with Run DMC) also Come Together a remake of the popular Beatles song. This a great CD for the casual Aroesmith listner."
3,pretty good introduction,"THis greatest hits collections attempts to give aerosmith's greatest hits of the 1970s and includes a lot of their best songs from the time period like sweet walk this way, come toghether, back in the saddle and come on. However, the album contains only ten songs. As big as Aerosmith was during the 1970s, more tracks should have been placed on the album like no surprize and nobody's fault. Credit to the songs the put on, put it should have been more."
3,You Guys Rock!,I really liked this except for the fact that it's a little too 80's sounding. This used to belong to my dad!
4,Aerosmith's Diamonds In The Rough,"This album is a must for total rock fans. It sounds awesome every time I play it. It opens with ""Dream On"" (ooooh the creepy guitar intro, still gives me goosebumps) and continues to rock until the final song is played. The remastered version is AWESOME. Pick it up and rock out, my friends!"
3,Greatest Songs,Here is aerosmith greatest 10 songs from 1973 to 1997.1.Mama Kin.(contains greatest riff in the world)2.Livin On the Edge.(awseome guitar intro)3.Dream On.(greatest power ballad ever)4.Dude Looks Like A Lady.5.Janie's Gotta Gun.6.Eat The Rich.7.Walk On Down.8.Walk This Way.9.Toys In the Attic.10.Crash.And about the greatest hits. Why put a remake from another band on your greatest hits (Come Together). Wheres Mama Kin and Pandoras Box??????
3,Dollars and (common) cents.,"I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).There are $4 worth of really great, classic rock songs on here. The timeless songs Aerosmith wrote while messed up on drugs: Dream On, Sweet Emotion, Walk This Way and Kings And Queens should be in every great music collection. The rest of the songs on here are garbage (album filler).iTunes and Aerosmith hooked up, so it appears at first that all the Aerosmith tunes can be purchased for a dollar a piece. However, as you dig deeper, you'll notice that most of their big hits, like those I just listed, are missing.I'd recommend buying either Aerosmith's ""Devil's Got A New Disguise"" for $11, or the ""Oh, Yeah!"" for $15. You'll be missing out on the song Kings And Queens, but you'll be getting the other three songs I listed, PLUS a lot of their big hits from when the band sobered up.Hope this helps.Darium"
3,Incomplete,"This is one of those releases where the record company is already thinking of a volume 2 before releasing volume 1. On purpose, the greedy executives did not included all greatest hits from the 70's into one CD. They left off classics like mama kin, train kept a rolling, etc. and instead used fillers like Last Child and Kings and Queens. Unfortunately, there is not a definite Greatest Hits CD from the 70's out there yet. This is all we have..."
4,Classic Aerosmith Sound,"Tyler, Perry and the boys have successfully wedded their classic sound with fresh material...great stuff. Put simply, if you like Aersomith, you'll love this."
2,I Could Have Made a Better Best Of,"This isn't there best of. It isn't anywhere near it. WHy did they even make a best of that early in their carrer. This has good songs but it isn't worth the money. Buy ""Oh Yea: Aerosmith's Biggest Hits"" or something with more songs because this isn't veryfullfilling with only 10 songs and some suck. They do a cover for Come Together originally by the beatles and it's terrible.2 best songs: Last Child & Sweet Emotion2 worst Songs: Come Together & Kings and Queens"
3,The way I see it is...,"Get this CD if you don't have ""O Yeah..."", but if you already have ""O yeah..ultimate areosmith hits"", don't get it. Great collection of songs!"
5,Impressed!!,I'm a Queen fan but I was impressed with Aerosmith because the music was great and they had alot of rock
3,Good look back on Aerosmith hits but the CD still lacks,"Aerosmith has definately made their own distinct sound and has churned out many hits. However, perhaps this CD was made too early for a greatest hits album. There are only 10 songs on the album. My personal faves are Come Together and Walk This Way. If you are a total Aerosmith fan than you pretty much need this CD. If not, but you want a Greatest Hits album, buy the Big Ones instead as there are more songs on it. This is still a good album though, and I'm still listening to it years after I bought it."
3,editorial what???,"This is to the editor who wrote the item description.I don't know how you can say that ""Kings and Queens"" is a weak link???? Lets get someone who is an actual knowledgeable fan of the band to write a description. Maybe if the song wasn't shortened it would be more appealing to this obvious aerosmith virgin. Aerosmith rocks, this cd is a good introduction to the bands work. Nothing more."
3,Reasonable collection,"I'm not a HUGE Aerosmith fan. Their best songs are here, but not all of these songs should be on a best-of. A bigger fan would give this a better rating, probably."
4,A good look at the band in the seventies,"As other reviewers, I would say that some songs are missing (a common problem with any greatest hits) Mama Kin is a good example, but one must admit that the essential is there. This is a good introduction to the band in the seventies, if you like it, go and get all their cd's !A pretty good ""greatest hits""PS Why is everybody's review is for the audio cassette and only a few for the cd ? I wrote my review where there were more reviews and that was in the audio cassette category. Am I missing something ?"
1,What a waste of money.,"The subject line says it all. Avoid this CD at all costs, especially if you're an Aerosmith fan.Don't get me wrong - the songs are great, but the album is a ripoff.Why?One simple word: butchering.Here are some examples: ""Kings and Queens"" and ""Back in the Saddle"" are both snipped slightly, while ""Walk this Way"" fades early.The most noticeable of the editing, however, is that the memorable intro and equally outstanding finale of ""Sweet Emotion"" are both gone.Columbia/Sony owes fans a better best of collection of the first Columbia Records tenure of Aerosmith, especially now that the band is back on the label.Again, if you're a fan of Aerosmith, don't get this album. You'll be better off getting the albums from whence these songs came."
2,for completists only,"The original Aerosmith compilation has become nothing more than a relic for completists. Originally released as a single LP record in 1980, there are only 9 songs from their first six records (with two of them, ""Sweet Emotion"" and ""Kings and Queens"", substantially edited) and the Beatles cover, ""Come Together"" (originally featured on the 'Sgt. Pepper's' movie soundtrack - you know, the one with the Bee Gees). For the casual fan, you can get just as many unedited songs from that era on the newest compilation, 'Oh Yeah!"""
3,Don't Start Here,"I'm a huge Aerosmith fan, in fact, they're my favorite band, and I do own this CD. It's absolutely great, besides the two tracks edited down, but it's just not the best place to start for a new fan. If you're a new fan, get ""Rocks"" and/or ""Aerosmith,"" if you want to truly get the Aerosmith experience. If you want to get the greatest hits, I think that ""Oh Yeah!"" would be the best choice. The Geffen Years (sorry for lack of title) would also be a good choice for late 80's, early 90's Aerosmith as well, but as we all know, that's a completely different Aerosmith.Aerosmith is, in my opinion, the greatest Rock & Roll band to ever grace the face of the Earth, so I'd highly recommend you listen to them. Just not with this. It's not worth the money when you could get these tracks and so much more many other ways.I'd only recommend it for collectors."
2,"OK, if you don't mind abridged versions","If you like classic Aerosmith, listening to this cd is a little like reading the Cliff's Notes for--say--Catcher in the Rye, if you like J.D. Salinger. Intros to songs and some of the interludes and guitar riffs are abbreviated or cut out altogether. And they're not even cut out clean, so you can tell where the edits are. It's pretty annoying. Shame on you, Columbia. Buy the cds of the original albums if you really like and respect this band."
4,Greatest Hits too short!,"I am a big fan of Areosmith and the cd Aerosmith's Greatest Hits is very good but in my view too short. Many big hits are on here (Dream On,Walk this way etc...)but it only has 10 tracks they could at least put the full version of Sweet Emotion on the cd! But it is an overall good cd. Recommened if you have never have heard Areosmith before or haven't heard some of their classics."
2,A disappointment as a graduate level resource.,"This book was purchased as a reference work for a research paper in a Master in Social Work program. Information on male prostitution presented is primarily, and heavily anecdotal. Little statistical presentation of data is offered. The author even seems to apologize for this fact early on in the work. Site chosen for exploration also limited to one ethnic group -- limiting the book's usefulness to the student."
1,Terrible,"All tracks contain pops, clicks and hisses, and the overall quality sounds like something out of a 1940's radio. With so many distractions, its hard to focus on the performance. Don't believe me? Listen to the sample and i'm more then positive you will agree."
2,You might want to consider a different collection,"I just received these mineral & rock collections, and I cannot say that I'm impressed. I bought the ""Geosafari"" Mineral Collection ($16), Sedimentary Rock Collection ($16), Igneous Rock Collection ($16) and the Metamorphic Rock collection ($16). The inner trays are a flimsy plastic; not really suitable for displaying. In addition, the rock and mineral samples are soooo tiny, almost like pebbles. That was really disappointing. I would not recommend these for purchase. Amazon should consider finding a more complete selection presented in quality displays with samples that are at least 1 1/2"" to 2"" or larger. Thank you."
2,Geosafari mineral collection review,"Identification of the minerals included depended on pictures on the cover; these were inadequate and did not match the actual items present. A few of the minerals seem to have a different item substituted. There was inadequate explaination of the items and variations that one might encounter. We bought it to test the minerals for a science fair project, so it still did what we needed it to, but we couldn't seem to depend on it as much as we would have liked."
5,Fish Stuff,Great price and love the size of the bottle. Had a hard time finding in a large quantity for the price.
5,A Truly Moving Glimpse Of The Life And Death Of Rachel Scott,"I first saw this video at a youth group outreach and I must say, there was not a dry eye in the house! It moved me deeply and I have not been the same since watching it.In this video, Darrell Scott (Rachel's father) discusses Rachel's life and shows us brief excerpts from her private journals. If you have read the moving book, Rachel's Tears, you will already be familiar with alot of what Darrell discusses on the video.The video also includes excerpts from Rachel's funeral as broadcast on CNN, which are also very moving, yet encouraging as we hear from her family and friends about the brief, yet inspiring life of this young lady who was incredibly passionate about living her life for God.By the end of this video, you will be motivated to take a stand for Jesus and to pick up the torch!"
5,TOUCHING!,"This was a soul touching video. It really shows the pain that not only the Scott family but the entire community had to endure. It also showed how they are dealing with this tragedy and point out that it was also ""A Spiritual Event."" I am a school resource officer and I know the only difference between my school and Columbine is nothing more than a whole bunch of miles, it can happen anywhere. I plan on showing this video to my kids at school so they can see the reailty of school violence. I think ANY parent (especially those with children in school) should watch this video!"
5,Amazing story,Rachel Joy Scott will be my role model ... hero ... This DVD is a DVD of Darell Scott speaking on his daughters stories ... you will definitely be touched by the story.
1,Fraud,This story is a complete and total fabrication. It never happened. There are many independent investigators who looked at the evidence and found that no one who was actually there remembers the killers saying this.
4,Great insights and practical hleps,"The insights and practical helps and recommendations were very good. As a retired special educational, I wish that I had learned this information years ago. The condition of the book was good. The delivery time was impressive."
5,A book that can change your life,"Dr. Zull combines expert knowledge of brain imaging studies and learning theory, enabling a practical understanding of the brain's learning cycle:(1) New information is received by the sensory cortex, then(2) Reflective observation is carried out by the integrative cortex, then(3) Abstract hypotheses are constructed in the frontal cortex, then(4) The new knowledge is subjected to active testing involving the motor cortex(Bringing in new knowledge to perpetuate the cycle)When all steps in the cycle are working well in an emotionally supportive environment, the result is continuous active learning. When any of these steps is inhibited, active learning is not achieved. Dr. Zull gives suggestions for removing these blocks using examples drawn from a long teaching career. The book has been very useful to me for improving communication."
5,WOW!,This is the most romantic music I have ever experienced! I strongly recommend this. Everyone who come to my home asks about the music.
5,The Right Questions,Simple and fantastic. It's an easy but powerful read. Ask yourself the right questions!!!
4,Reluctant to Admit -- Decent Read,"Typically these touchy-feely self-help books aren't my thing. In this case, the author does a good job at using examples to bring the message home. The stories get somewhat repetitive and the material could have been condensed even further; but ultimately, the lessons took root and I find myself quoting from the book."
4,Keep it Simple,"Debbie Ford's ten, simple questions are really all you need to know in order to keep your focus on your personal growth and self-esteem building. They are easy to understand and use and can be used in any situation. Great simple tools to propel you forward, especially if you are stuck. The only catch is you'll need to answer them honestly in order to benefit from their wisdom."
2,Repetitive,"Ford starts with a question, and then within that chapter she says essentially the same thing over and over again, just in different words. I found this boring and tedious. It's like she had ten questions in mind, but she had trouble finding enough to say about them to fill a whole book.On a different note, some Christians may have a problem with Ford's last question, ""Am I choosing from my Divinity or am I choosing from my humanity?"" However, other Christians may interpret ""my Divinity"" to mean the Holy Spirit which resides in followers of Christ, rather than meaning that we are actually God/gods. I don't want to speculate here on what Ford herself believes or what she intended these words to mean. That is not crucial anyway. It is up to readers to interpret these words according to their own beliefs."
4,I love the simplicity and practicality of this book,"The Right Questions is great! It's concise, well-written and easy to read. You can take the wisdom in this book and apply it immediately to your life.The step-by-step nature of the process is especially useful for teaching your brain how to be more disciplined and to increase your own personal integrity.I also recommend you consider visiting the Right Questions site (by the same name) for a video message from Debbie and a newsletter. I appreciate the additional support in my life in asking ""The Right Questions""."
2,Very disappointing read,"Although this book is well written and some people find it effective, these 10 questions did not produce any results for me. Just being truthful."
2,Activation Solution,It is a great product. But the bottling is poor. The product leaked from the lid.
5,A solution for my problem ;),"I read a few reviews about propylene glycol and the use of it in cigar humidors and it truly holds a relative humidity of 70%. This solution saved me time, I'd suggest it."
3,Unsure yet.,This product seems to have a slight variance in the actual humidity. I haven't been able to get a 68-70% humidity yet. It took about five days to hit the 65% mark and has just kind of hovered there. I made sure the hygrometer was accuarate and just kinda left it at that. I probably won't buy it again. And the three stars is a bit of a stretch. I'd give it two and a half if I could.
1,Xikar - Terrible Customer Service,I emailed Xikar to ask them what % of this product is propylene glycol and they said they couldn't tell me because it is part of their patent. ROFL. I guess they don't know what patents are FOR and HOW THEY WORK.
1,Hard to reach,I ordered the wrong HP cartridge. Tried several times to call with no luck. I e-mailed them and they got back after a couple of days. They said they would credit the shipping charge and send me a mailer label to return the item. They did credit the shipping but 2 weeks later I have not received a return label.
5,HP PHOTO VALUE PACK 02,"This is a great product to start with, but with the addition of printing paper and a great price I would recommend this to all."
2,not a terrific value,"I thought I was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks, they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually. But when I later bought a one-off replacement -- not ""custom"" -- tank I noticed the ink level bar on the printer LCD was not only full but also longer than the other bars! If the ""custom"" tanks hold only about half the ink, this isn't the bargin it appears."
2,Beware! *custom* cartridges are not full!,"There is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper. The cartridges are not full! I just got off the phone with HP tech support and they confirmed this. The cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as *custom* cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4X6 photos. In fact, the tech support rep discribed the *custom* cartridges as having ""way less"" than standard cartridges, ""less than 50% full"". On a related note, I asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my new printer were full, and he said they should have been full standard cartridges.So this value pack isn't such a great value now, is it?"
1,Deceptive Marketing!,"As others have noted, these cartridges are not full cartridges, even though HP very cleverly avoids giving you that info. On their website, for a single cartridge purchase, the details list the ML in the cartridge, not so for the Value Pack.I just bought the C6180 which requires that the ""initialization"" cartridges in the box be used first. Mine we're faulty and now I've got to wait for HP to overnight new ones, even though I've got a value pack sitting here.I should have known better. All 5 colors and B&W; for $36 (plus photo paper) when individual cartridges cost $10. When you shop in a grocery store the merchant is required to tell you how much product you are paying for, why shouldn't HP be required to do the same.Shame, shame, HP."
2,Shameful Deceptive Advertising,"Think you're getting HP 02 cartridges at a bargain price? -- Not. HP is deceiving you through lack of appropriate disclosure. The cartridges are not nearly the same ink quantity as standard 02 cartridges. When you see the phrase ""custom cartridge"", it's HP's weasel words for ripping you off."
1,Can you say RIP OFF?,"If it looks to good to be true, it is. What a rip off, you think you are getting a great deal on the ink cartridges only to find out you are paying for very little ink and a whole lot of 4 x 6 that you will never use because you will run out of ink after 20 photos..come on HP print the information on the box."
4,Good,Standard product. Repeat buy. Got free sheets of photo paper to make it a good deal. Would have prefered free printing paper rather than photo paper
2,HP inc.,"the product works fine, but it only had a small amount of ink in the replacement, when reading about the product I thought it to be of the larger ink supply, Five pictures later I ran out of Magenta."
4,HP 02 4x6 Combo Pack,I buy this pack mostly for the 150 sheets of 4x6 paper. The 6 cartridges are a bonus but they contain less ink compared to buying the cartridges seperately.
1,Not full cartidges,"Same as other reviewers - not a bargain, as the ink cartridges are not full. Shame on HP."
2,"hp ""scams"" customers; not full ink tanks","Thought this was an excellent value when I ordered it. BUT . . . nowhere is the information shown that you are NOT getting full ""tanks"" of ink. I purchased two of these packages because of the ""bundle"" price. What one receives is a bit less of a bargain than first imagined: the custom ink cartridges are standard hp units -- but filled to only 60%- 70% of their normal capacity. I.e., will print ~ 150 photos instead of ~240... (Note -- this was confirmed by hp support after an hour-long phone call!) Shame on hp for perpetrating this fraud on its customers! Shame on Amazon for not doing its homework and passing on this fraud w/o warning its customers. CAVEAT EMPTOR (buyer beware) is not the slogan I have associated with Amazon on other products and past purchases!"
1,Read the fine print -- not a good deal,"As others have said, it's not immediately clear that you're buying ink cartridges with less ink in them. I'm returning mine (they are still unopened) for the full-ink ones."
2,Low on Ink!,"Like most people, most of the items I print out use mostly black ink. I have bought this package twice, and have given up on it. Why? The ink cartridges are simply not full. I especially noticed that the black ink runs out much faster than if I were to buy a black cartridge on its own. HP Vivera inks are a total ripoff. They are overpriced and packages like this contain not completely filled cartridges. My first suggestion to you would be to buy another printer."
3,Hp Value Pack,"This item met my need at the time. The saying, you get what you pay for holds true. I brought this item knowing full well that you don't get as much ink in the containers as you do when you buy the non value packs that cost more money. I did the research and it is a fact that these value packs are not completely filled by the manufactures. But I knew what I was getting. Sometime you have to opt for value over quantity. But this is genuine Vivera HP Inks. Just in smaller quantity."
4,Great sound. Definitely a must for your collection.,I listen to this CD about once a week while riding to work so that I can keep my sanity. It was a gift from my daughters that keeps on giving.
2,Nice Backgroud Music,I used this CD for a recent Reniassance meal. It's rich tones gave a mistic air to the meal and set the tone for a truly interesting event.
5,Great book - great condition,The book is currently not in print and was recommended as a read for those who have visited or will visit Ireland. Great book and it arrived in great conndition.
2,Blah,This alarm goes off whenever it feels like it. It also is so light that it falls on the floor very easily. Mine broke from falling too many times. I was relieved because it didn't even work in the first place. I am all for low-fi when I works!! I would not recommend.
3,Small Aiwa clock radio,"I looked in several places for a small bedside clock radio and oreded the Aiwa from Amazon. Trouble is the radio bands are so close it's almost impossible to locate and tune into a radio station, so I moved it to another room and am still looking for a radio. I am disappointed and unfortunately you can't try it out in advance. Woulddn't buy it again. But is cute!Flo Philips"
2,"Looks good, don't like the alarm functions","The snooze is only 5 minutes and you can't reset the alarm after it goes off. For example, when I set it for 5:30, if I want it to go off at 6:00 instead, i can't just spin the dial to 6:00. No matter what I do, it keeps going off every five minutes, unless I actually turn off the alarm. It is not convenient as an alarm unless you never want to change the wake up time and don't mind a five minute snooze button. I use it now only as a small radio."
2,British R&B group,This is a new British R&B group who took their name from Mary J Blige's album - but seem to be more pop than anything else. This single is a nice try but no big hit.
5,Wonderful,"This very readable cookbook contains recipes to please both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Foods are hearty, flavorful and nutritious. The author leads cooks through each step of preparation making this book ideal for beginning vegetarians as well as experienced cooks. Each recipe I have used has turned out beautifully and unique ingredient combinations have produced memorable meals."
3,The New Vegetarian Epicure,"Somewhat of a disappointment, perhaps because the first book is so iconic - I'm on my third copy, and that's getting fairly worn."
1,"Poorly tested recipes, lack creativity.","I'm a long time vegetarian and something of a cook book collector. All cookbooks should be thoroughly tested to avoid frustrating the user. This book consistently failed on that account. Vegetarian cookbooks should also show a level of creativity that may not be as important in more traditional books because they are aimed at creating a new cuisine, not an historical one. This book fails on this account too. Try looking at the Greens book or Ron Picarski's books."
5,"Challenging, yet worthwhile recipes","When we lived in rural Ohio, this book received little use...too many of the ingredients were not available. Now that we live in California, I use this book more frequently. Many of the recipes are complicated...the author takes few shortcuts, yet I have never been disappointed with anything I have cooked from this book. Everything is very flavorful.Yes...in the Thanksgiving menu the author includes her husband's turkey recipe, in the spirit of being inclusive at family feasts. While I do not plan on using it, I see no reason to dismiss the book outright because of one recipe out of several hundred."
1,Disappointing experience,"You would think the author of a vegetarian cookbook would understand the definition of ""vegetarian,"" but Anna Thomas doesn't seem to. I was happily thumbing through my copy, when in the middle I had a rude discovery: a spread on how to carve a turkey. The author explains its presence away by asserting that even vegetarians won't want to pass up a turkey now and then! Um, what?It's pretty off-putting to people who are vegetarian for ethical reasons, myself included, to come across a turkey-carving spread when any reasonable reader would assume we're on on meat-free turf (having been lulled into this belief by the title). Turkey carving instructions have no place in a vegetarian cookbook, and the spread ruined the book for me, turning it into something I never would have wanted had I been afforded full knowledge of its contents before buying it."
4,First rate,"Hadn't seen this cookbook for a while, but got lucky while doing some fall cleaning of the kitchen. Before it disappeared into the ""catchall"" drawer, it was a favorite guide for a wide range of vegetarian dishes. Favorites include the whole mezze chapter; recipes for buckwheat crepes (savory) that can be filled with just about anything; and a range of fall/winter vegetables. ""Queen of the Hop"" here is wild mushroom cobbler (I leave out the oyster mushrooms and substitute cremini).""""Epicure"" doesn't break a lot of new ground, but it does provide a valuable collection of really good recipes that often lean international. You could cook with this guide alone and be completely happy."
5,Wonderful book,Nice book...wonderful recipes...love Anna Thomas.You can always flip the pages containing turkey...they are very few.After all the well known moosewood cook books contain fish recipes which either comes from plant source...but I love those books too and just flip the pages or section dedicated for seafood.
4,Great story + reasons to use Barleygreen,"This tells the very interesting story of how the author went from developing drugs to developing ""the ideal fast food"" which would be full of nutrients, as a way to strengthen the immune system. He describes in detail all that he went through before he finally developed AIM Barleygreen (TM) (aka Green Barley Essence).Also, this is great for anyone who wants to know the scientific details of the all the nutrients in Barleygreen, as well as how it is made. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for ways to imrove their health."
5,About the University of Chicago Editions (Pines and Strauss),"The University of Chicago Edition in trade paperback is in two handsome volumes: a gold and a green trade paperback.Here's blurbage from the back:""This work by Pines and Strauss must be recognized as one of the most important contributions to the study of Maimonides in the present century. The translation is of a quality unequalled in a modern language."" - Journal of the History of Philosophy""Leo Strauss' penetrating essay alone would give high value to this volume.... On the other hand, whithout this essay the new translation would make this an important book that is unlikely to be surpassed for a long time."" - Times Literary Supplement""Competent Reviewers have without exception praised this translation.... As a whole, the book is simply indispensable."" - The Modern Schoolman"
5,Voices of Our Time,"Studs Turkel is a wonderful interviewer, and over the past five decades he has interviewed many of the great thinkers, writers, and doers of our time. The ones he chose for this collection include Aaron Copland, Oliver Sacks, Margaret Mead, Daniel Ellsberg, Maya Angelou, Pete Seeger, John Kenneth Galbraith, and dozens of others. All together, they provide a fascinating portrait of the last half of 20th century. Highly recommended!"
5,Breathtaking!!!,"These interviews do NOT disappoint!!! They are concise, interesting and provide a clear crystal-like glimpse into each person Stud's interviews.I wish there were more. Studs manages to be down to earth yet not fawning.Charlie Rose, take lesson from Studs! When will there be more???"
5,A great collection of a master interviewer,"Studs Terkel is one of the great historians, letting the stories be told by those who actually witnessed the event. Terkel is one of the foremost oral historians, and these interviews are only a mere insight into the amount of work he has done and recorded."
5,Studs Set the Bar,"Celebrity interviews: Studs did it first! Studs may still be the best!The interviews on this collection do not leave the listener wanting more. Studs does it ""just right""! He is the master of the obvious - he asks the questions that we'd ask if the subjects were sitting at our dinner table. On this collection he talks to Gore Vidal, Bertrand Russell, Woody Allen, Dorothy Parker and Pete Seeger, just to name a few.Studs was non-confrontational though he never failed to ask the hard quesions.This is a refreshing collection of interviews with important and interesting subjects conducted by a master. Well worth your time and money.....bg"
1,Bad Text By Department Chair,"I was a student at Cal State Fullerton, where these professors teach. This is the worst textbook I have ever read. The text is poorly written. The book doesn't read well and has many typos. I would have expected more from the Management Science Department Chair."
1,Use this textbook at your own risk!,"If there's a worse textbook out there for this subject (or any for that matter), I've never encountered it. I almost failed the course thanks to this piece of junk. The chapters are about 20% theory/principles on the topics and 80% ""how to use Excel to solve the problems."" The only problem is that the templates supplied have errors in them and are, therefore, USELESS! Also, Excel is slow to solve and the templates are difficult to use. There is plenty of decision support software out there that is easier to use and doesn't cost a fortune.Long story short, if I hadn't dug up my 17-year-old textbook from when I took this course as an undergrad, I would never have survived.If you must use this textbook, you have my sympathies.I would have given this textbook 0 stars, but Amazon won't let me rate that low."
3,Applied Management Science: A Computer-Integrated Approach f,"This is a nobel effort. to try to do a very hard thing. The author however is very hard to follow and at times the explanations drifts into incoherance. Also, I think the author may be too brilliant to write for the average student. He might be better served by having a grad student or military trained person break down the book into coherant steps. This book has some gems of useful info, trapped in some bad explainations. The next version of this may be a truly great textbook. My advice to the author is to simplify and go step by step. Delete text and runon paragraphs where possible. If you take a class based on this book, insist on a lab and a helpful grad student."
1,TOO MUCH STATIC,"I purchased this for school, tested this out at home and I was very disappointed by the static. I was sitting in my living room with my two children and I couldn't even hear my 3 year old talk there was so much static, the sound quality was really bad. TO say the least I am returning this item. Now I will have to purchase one that will be more expensive and hopefully will have better sound and no static."
5,Hang it here,"Loved getting these, finally able to get all the coffee/tea mugs off the counter and out of my small cabinet. Strong enough for some of my pans too and matched the red in my kitchen. Great product and came in a timely fashion. Thank you."
4,Not color shown,"They worked for my purposes, but they are actually a dark red color, not the pink shown in the picture."
5,Easy to install,"The filter was was very easy to install, with very detailed, step-by-step directions. I drive a stock Corolla, so I don't expect any crazy horsepower gains. I do, however, notice that it does seem to have a little more power on take-off, the engine idles much more smoothly, and my idle rate dropped from about 1,100RPM to 600RPM.Pros:slight increase in responsiveness,very easy to install,looks goodCons:when the engine is cold, at idle, you will hear a loud ""sucking"" sound. I was not aware, but apparently this is normal for this type of intake and vehicle."
5,ELECTRIC,"MY BIASED VIEW:I heard this no. 4 on the radio in the car, and it made me see again that LVB was a huge talent - even in his less-played work. Hogwood makes no. 4 sound like pure, supercharged brilliance! A wonderful work. Eerie buildup into those fountain-surging bursts in the first movement. The whole piece is astonishing. Used for about a dollar.... I'd go for it. Or get the big 9 by Hogwood?=\=\="
5,Best book on current firearm models and variations available,"As an avid firearm collecter and a book reading addict I can only say that as everyone knows,this is the best book on the market that can tell you absolutely anything you need to know about all of the models of firearms that are currently available in all of there different caliber and model configurations and suggested retail prices.If you are currently interested in purchasing a firearm or are thinking about buying a gun in the future then you owe it to yourself to first buy this book.You will learn more about the different possible options in this one book than in all the gunshops in the country."
4,neighbours! the perfect blend,"neighbours is a australian soap based on the cahracters of ramsey street.this cd answers many questions to peoples answers who sung that track?. many of the cast have gone off to do there own singing and release there own albums holly valance,delta goodrem and kylie minouge to name just a few.the soap is exellent and the cd is to. only thing i didnt like was the song suddenly by angry anderson was only featured a s a video on the dvd and not a tune. cause it features in an important sceneadam walker england"
1,"I Would Give This Book A ""0"" If I Could","This is really a stupid and dumb book, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.It has questins like:What is your most detested chore?What made you decide to pursue your current occupation?Is there a specific moment when you realized that you were emotionally connected to me?If I suddenly lost interest in sex, would we be able to survive as a couple?In the words of Scrooge, ""Bah, Humbug!"""
4,Rating,I found this book to be very informative and useful and would recommend it without hesitation. Good questions to ask to get to know your partner better.
4,Questions,Many times you know there are questions you want to ask but you don't know what they are. This book is good at supplying them.
3,under 30,If you are over 30 buy another book. If you are under 30 buy this one. It is not a book for those who have been married 30 years or more. My mistake. Very embarrassing questions. maybe for the young who do not care but not for us old folks!
1,a dud,"This would probably appeal to teens beginning new relationships. Reminded me of the teen magazine survey ( i.e. who is your favorite rock star?, What flavor ice cream do you like?)"
2,Not so introspective questions,"I bought this for my husband for our anniversary, thinking it might be a fun conversation piece. Instead, I found a lot of boring questions that most married couples would have to know anyway before getting married. This book would be much more ideal for a high school couple or for just snagging at your bookstore to flip through with a group of friends while you sit at the coffee shop. I was disappointed."
3,Good for Teens,"I felt there were too many questions that were simply irrelevant. There needed to be more questions that really got to the heart and core of relationships like finance, religion and philosophy of life.I'd highly recommend 1000 Questions for Couples instead which I thought covered all the bases very well."
3,Questions,"I was looking for a book to get to know my husband better. This one was okay but I already know a lot of the answers. There needs to be one for couples who have been together for many years and want to learn newer deeper things about their spouses. However, I have pulled some of the questions to use with my pre-maritial counseling clients and I think it is great for them."
5,AWESOME!!,These bricks expand like CRAZY!! I am using for gormet mushroom bulk substrate & a half brck expanded soo much. These things have a lot of nutritional value too. Also make good bedding for reptiles I hear.
4,Great product but slow receiving,This product works great and is ideal for the tarantulas we own. It seem to take quite some time to get here though.
4,""" it's dirt """,What else is there to say about this product? Only difference is the 3-pack is cheaper through amazon than that place where to pets go or those other people.
5,Great for Burrowing animals!,"My tegu loved to dig through this stuff. I recently switched to newspaper due to the large enclosure upgrade. But I may switch back.Odor resistant, holds humidity, doesn't mold easily (only if there is food or waste stuck to it)."
5,works great,This did a great job of replacing our old substrate for our hermit crabs. The bricks rehydrated easily and were very cost effective. The crabs actually have been a lot more active since they got into this substrate. A great deal at this price.
4,just what it says,"After starting to build a terrarium for my crested geckos, I did alot of research before choosing the right substrate. This stuff did the trick. Only I wish I had checked my local pet store first they sell it for a fraction of the cost and they sell loose substrate ( not compressed) which would have been alot easier for the project at hand instead of soaking and allowing to dry prior to use. Great product other than those two factors."
3,"Nice, but more expensive than brick form","I've used this as a substrate for my hermit crabs and really liked it. It's great stuff, but you can buy the exact same thing and get more for your money if you get the compressed bricks. Now that I've tried the bricks, I don't plan to buy this again."
5,Funny and Thought Provoking,"I haven't made it all the way through the book yet, but I have enjoyed the many funny and thought provoking one liner's I have read. This is a book where you can turn to any page and find a line of wisdom that will keep you thinking for the rest of the day. I like to pick up the book and just flip through the pages and read one liner's at random. The book is indexed by subject so it is easy to look up topics such as marraige, education, or religion when you want a one liner on a specific topic - and Joel Randall covers lots of topics with his thoughts and humor. There is definitely something for everyone in this book."
3,ROSA WILL CLEAN UP!,"Rosa is a spirited little dog who looks mostly like an anvil headed English bull terrier. She loves to chew things and will chew and swallow any object left in her path.Her owner loves her dearly and will move mountains for her. When Rosa swallows one of her rubber squeaky toys, her owner has her admitted to a pet hospital where the dog undergoes surgery to remove the rubber toy.Hospitals are frightening places for anybody of any age. To her credit, the author helps keep some of that fear at bay by having a dog patient as opposed to a human patient. Using this distancing technique makes it easier to laugh at the notion of a pet hospital (such places do exist) and cheer for the recovery of the avaricious little dog."
5,One of the best in the biz,I have had the pleasure to not only listen to Lori's music but also see her preform in Ca and New Mexico.It is a treat to see the band live.I would recommend to anyone DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.The band has so much energy that it will leave you wanting for more.What a great time I hope to see them again soon.
5,Rythmic State Choones,"If you ever attended the massive outdoor events like the Rezerection you will know this album is the ultimate in happy Scottish Gabber. F@ck me its good and this is the first place i've seen it. Steep price but well worth it, check the number of tunes. The happy Scottish Gabba scene has gone back underground and is well relived with the storming blessing of a cd. BUY THIS YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO, even if it is only for the one track ""soap on a rope"""
1,What???,Her short stories and poems are soo sweet and heart felt that it seems unrealistic. Maybe it's just me but hey at least I know someone agrees with me. Everyone seems to be in love with this storyteller's book but I beg to differ. My professor had us read it for Asian American 15 and out of all 5 books...it was my least favorite.Kelly Hue
1,Shall we cry for her?,"I'm a little iffy about this book as well. Like the other review said, she's one of many stories. So what makes her stand out? I've read better books about the vietnam war. I'm really into short stories about the vietnam war since my grandfather is a veteran. I apologize to the people that enjoyed this book soo much because I didn't. I'd say you should check it out at the local library if available but not a buyer."
4,Laissez les bon temps rouller!,"Another excellent Alligator Stomp compilation. Great party music, or a wonderful ""first buy"" for those just getting their feet wet with Cajun/Zydeco. I'm not usually a big fan of compilations, but Rhino does a great job putting together some obscure cuts and songs by lesser-known artists. This is some tasty gumbo! To those unfamiliar with the Alligator Stomp series, I recommend this and Volume 2 as the best."
4,Great ep for lovers of acoustic incubus,"One reviewer is wrong, acoustic and orchestral drive are different, the orchestral version has just that, orchestral additions to the original song, acoustic drive is just that, acoustic.All the songs here are great, even the proper bside corwded elevator, with a bit of final production polish it could easily make the album cut.For those interested, there is also another 3 track drive single out there with no new songs between the Aus and EU versions but does contain the drive video."
2,Not a safe workout for pregnant women!,"There are 2 main problems with this video: First, it's difficult to follow the aerobic steps, because the instructor doesn't give you any advance notice of changing the steps, and doesn't explain very clearly. At times on the video, you can even see the two women behind her mess up the steps because they can't follow either! Second, and the bigger problem, is the entire stretching session following the workout, is done on your BACK! All the instructor says is, if you're past you're first trimester, you might not want to do these exercises....but then doesn't give you any alternatives! So basically, this exercise video is a waste of money for anyone in the 2nd or 3rd trimester!"
1,A waste of a workout,"I was very disappointed with this video. The instuctor does a horrible job, not giving proper cueing before each new set of moves. The aerobics did nothing for me, I was never in the target heart rate zone during the checks. The leg work at the end was okay, but the entire stretching section was done on the back, which we all know you should avoid after your first trimester. I may continue to use the tape for VERY low energy days, only because I feel like it was such a waste of my money, I want to try and get something out of it."
5,Loved it!,"I think this video is great! I did it almost every day from my 4th month until my 9th month started(now my feet are too swollen)Although, it is not extremely challenging, you can increase the intensity(bigger movements, etc.)and get your heart rate up. Yeah, I agree with everyone else, the instructor is pretty bad, but since I have done the video every day for several months, I have it memorized. You only really have to do it for a week and you know what youre doing by heart. But I LOVE the video, it was fun, and I could put it in every day and do it. I also bought the Denise Austin one, but I HATED it!!"
1,Uncoordinated workout,"This tape was not worth the money. I gave it away. The directions are poor. The flow feels uncoordinated and choppy. It wasn't interesting, and it wasn't a great workout. Pay a little extra for a better tape. You'll be glad you did."
2,Just OK!,"This video was a disappointment! The steps are not creative or well arranged at all. They go back to the same couple of little steps over and over through all the sections. I would complain that they didn't que the moves, but they were so simplistic and repititious that I really didn't have trouble picking them up. Overall, the video was just bland! The workout itself, the music, and the demeanor of the participants were all boring. I agree with other reviews who said to spend your money on something better, like Kathy Smith's pregnancy workout (it was really good!)."
3,Good book...needs a second edition,"Peter Kuo (of DreamLAN consulting), has done an excellent job of providing an overview and the details necessary to build a successful NetWare 4.11 based Web Server. The majority of the book is ""timeless"" for people just starting to build an Intranet or Internet site.However, I would really like to see a second addtion covering the updated features of NetWare based web sites including Oracle 8 integration and Netscape Fastrack and Enterprise servers."
4,An excellent album,"A really nice example of Eliza's work.Great if you like live albums, and a good example if you've not met Eliza's work before.Highly recommended.Ian"
3,unviewable,"Was keen to see this film, as I was in it. Unhappily the dvd was unplayable on either Pal or NSTC: so dvd as it stood was useless. Luckily I found someone to unravel it....am totally inept with machines....so I have a reasonably OK viewable copy. It seems to me that , if you are to advertise in UK dvds unplayable in UK, that should be made absolutely plain in theadvertisement."
4,Looks good so far,"Checked out from library, read intro... I like the brain-based approach, but would be more complete with a religious angle on contributing to ending hate. Up to date with references to 9-11."
1,Not Impressed,"I started this book with hopes of making a good psychology presentation. This book has some points that are very good, especially the areas with the biology of hate. But the rest of the book is filled with tangents that make little to no connection to the topic of hate. How does cromagnon (sp?) art tell us about hate? I still dont know.Don't read it especially if you are looking for a psychology book."
5,Gorgeous binding,Others can tell you what a good book this is. I have to tell you that it is printed on wonderful-feeling smooth paper with a dull-varnished cover and feels soft and weighty and absolutely delightful to hold.
1,I didn't want to finish it,"It's been a long time since I haven't finished a book, even ones I didn't like. I really enjoyed Goethe's Faust and thought that this book would be a great follow up. I've never read any of Mann's books but I took a shot on this one and wish I didn't.I found the text to be far too complex and verbose. Way too many charachters to keep track of and very and I mean very little action. It takes halfway into the book before the conversation with Adrian and the Devil takes place and I was hoping that this would make the mostly arduous journey of reading (although the discussions of religion in the fraternity was interesting) the book worth it. But the conversation with the Devil was boring and in my estimation difficult to understand why Adrian was lured.I read the next chapter and then I realized I don't like this book, I haven't liked this book and drudging through another 200+ pages just to finish it isn't worth it."
5,Magnificent,"Thomas Mann's tragic rendering of the myth of Faust is an extraordinarily rich work of artistry and beauty. Adrian Leverkuhn is the precocious object of the narrator's affection, as he ascends into brilliance until a calculated bargain with the devil consigns his humanity to damnation. This is a brilliant allegory for Gerany's interior collapse as it degenerates into the Third Reich. There are moments in Doctor Faustus that are as strong as anything Mann has ever written, such as the remarkably detailed descriptions of 20th century musical composition. Truly an aesthetic experience of deep and complex proportions."
4,Major mistakes in the translation,"The work itself has been well-reviewed here. But Woods's translation, at least in the hardcover edition, makes some huge mistakes with musical terminology. The worst is the translation of the German pitch ""B"" as B in English: it should be B-flat, as the German pitch ""H"" is our B. This makes a world of difference in the discussion of musical passages, and in general one finds that Woods is not the most felicitous translater of musical concepts. It's a shame, because musical concepts are absolutely central to the concerns of the novel."
4,Very Interesting social Experiment.,"This documentary was quite chilling and while I might not go as far as to say that the web is creating slavery, some of the points made in the movie from Josh Harris are compelling. Think of this movie as a physical representation of the Internet (Or TV, a little bit of both). People are put in pods (their rooms) where everything they do is on a channel. People had no privacy and in a short time their personalities changed, this aspect of constant surveillance (anybody can watch anybody) creates problems for the human brain and how we deal with our own social problems. If that one aspect of the technology was removed though, would it be slavery? Who knows, it's really up to you. ^_^"
5,Great quality magnet!,"This magnet is big. It is the perfect size for placing on a refrigerator or car. Color quality, sharpness, and clarity are great too. Would recommend to any Fin Fan!"
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"I purchased this based on a recommendation from some one else. It started out in a manner that I thought would make the movie funny, but it got worse and continued on for the remainer of the film. When it was over I was thinking ""there went an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back."""
2,Didn't like the heroine in Indiscreet,"The plot of Indiscreet was interesting, but the heroine was hard to like-- too disagreeable, too petulant, too distrusting, too argumentative. All the while I was reading, I felt so sorry for the hero, thinking that I wish he could find a better mate than this woman, that he could find someone who would be more enjoyable to be around than this heroine was. Yikes, she was terrible. The only time I liked her was at the beginning of the book when she was drunk .At that time she was humorous, witty, clever, easy to get along with--very likeable. Too bad she didn't stay sloshed throughout the book; that way at least then I could understand why the hero would fall in love with her. Sober, she is just too hard to get along with. I enjoyed the heroine in my favorite Candace Camp book, Suddenly, more than this one because even though the heroine in Suddenly is much younger, she is much more mature and much more kindhearted than this one in Indiscreet."
4,Enjoyable,Good book. Enjoyed reading it. Characters and storyline were easy to get attached to. I would certainly recommend this book.
2,Not a beginner book! for novices!!,"I am sorry but this book is not a novice or begiiner book on C#.I purchased this book to learn C# and its Object Oriented features.The first part of the book about branching , looping are great but as soon as you start the chapters about Object Oriented you get some programs as examples who are ""POORLY"" explained so basically you are trying to figure out what the program does on your own.This book is ""NOT"" a book for a ""real"" beginner in programming meaning you have no programming experience. This book was made for ""programmers"" who are beginner in C# programming. Do you guys get the nuance? If you are TOTALLY new in programming trust me this book is not worth at all. A better option will be absolute beginner or C# 2005 for dummies."
3,"Not Bad - but not ""Learning Perl,"" either....","I loved Learning Perl. I hoped that another ""Learning..."" book by this great publisher would be similiar.It is, in some respects. It's well written, easy to read and it has proven a useful tool.However, I can only give it three stars because it lacks exercises at the end of each chapter. I loved that feature in ""Learning Perl"" and miss it dearly.Perhaps O'Reilly is moving away from this technique, a shame if that's the case.As it stands, I'll end up buying another book (MS's Step by Step) to give me some practice exercises."
4,Good Introduction to C#,This is a good introduction to C# but you can't depend only on 1 book. You can read Programming C# it's a good book too. I read some articles for an author called Michael Youssef in www.c-sharpcorner.com he's a great author and write in a very simple way that you can 100% grasp I hope that he publish his book soon.
2,Not the robust book you may be looking for,"One of the great benefits of using C# is the ability to use the many built in methods. This book covers very few of them. It doesn't even cover the common ones like Math and DateTime. If you're looking for a book to cover fundamental C programming, this may work. If you're looking for an introduction to the new features and methods within C# specifically, this ISN'T it."
4,Jesse Liberty and Brian MacDonald pull it together nicely!,"I am a Visual Basic 6 programmer and I have been set it my ways. I figured I could have started at the next level up but something nagged me to start at the begining. I am happy I started with this book and my next book will be by this author.This book is well crafted and has reintroduced topics to me that has bid me a better understanding of complex subjects in a way that just clicked for me. This book has even taught me things about the if statement that I didn't even realize were happening. ""short circuiting""The knowledge of the langauge by the authors is unquestionable. The thoroughness of the lessons is supperior. I recommend this book highly.The complaint I have is the examples in the book are boring. That is the reason for the 4 star review."
4,Sound reminds many who hear it of early R.E.M.,"This band's sound reminds many who have heard it of early R.E.M. As far as I'm concerned, that's pretty high praise! This is particularly evident in song #2 on the disk, ""Me or Him"" but can also be heard on other songs.. The lyrics and sound are catchy, the more you listen to this CD the more you appreciate it. I think that their sound is still developing but it's definately going in the right direction. This type of sound is poised to explode this summer with Wilco and Sun Volt both signed on as opening bands for major tours. Sixty Acres could find themselves gaining quite a bit of exposure in a realitivly short time. I also recommend seeing this band live if you have the chance! They have developed some outstanding songs since this CD was released so you won't simply find yourself listening to a regurgitation of this CD. St. Rose is particularly outsanding among these new new songs."
3,Down Home Goodness,"Sixty Acres' BANJOS AND SUNSHINE starts out with a blast of musicianship that lets you know they mean business. Solid playing, catchy rythyms, down-home vocals and intelligent and witty lyrics make this collection of ""alternate country"" (I suppose that's what this sound is generally known as these days) stand out and make you wanna hear more. There's a lot of unexpected twists in the words that tells me there's a clever mind at work writing this stuff.Right off, my favorite is ""WGFR"", a song about a Gospel station. I expect this will work its way into my own personal ""playlist"" before long.The newly-added bonus tracks are less impressive (perhaps even uncalled-for) but some of them do give you a chance to hear the band perform LIVE!If you like this, other bands I might reccomend are Star City and 34 Satellite. Rock on!"
3,Release the whole ... thing not just bits n pieces,They should have made this one 2cd's. The music on this cd is awesome 5 stars but when ever the Meters start rockin the folks at Rhino decided to fade the end of a few jams out to make it fit on one CD. Please remaster the whole concert on two CD's. Love The One Your With fades out during a really cool vocal jam for example. Hey Pockey way Fades out also. This just screwed up my enjoyment of this cd.

4,RPG with a twist,"this game has most the aspects of typical RPG's, but it also incorporates a card system to fight in battle. I have Played almost every RPG series their is out there and this one is one of the better ones. the thought of a card system first made me neglect to buy it but after i played it for a couple hours the card based system became very interseting and complimented the gameplay. Good solid graphics and sound, very colorful, good voice acting, are just a few reasons to buy this game."
1,Sample Code Missing!!!!,from the very first example. How frustrating is that?? this book cost me 40 bucks and bam!! Wish I would have saved the receipt.
3,"Nice watch, but having difficulty getting it to function!","This is definitely a great watch! However, I was mislead by the picture that is provided. The main reason I bought it was because the picture makes the watch look ""dark grey."" However, it is actually more ""light silver"" of a color. It is still a nice watch though.Additionally, I've read over the instructions multiple times and I still am unable to get the chronograph to function correctly (i.e. reset, start/stop.)The watch is very comfortable and the weight is just right!"
1,Idiots don't include decent instructions,"This belt has a unique fastening system (which I may yet not have mastered correctly). The sellers obviously think it is intuitive, it isn't. The simple instructions are ""Before putting your pants on, fasten this belt around your waist and over your shirt."" Now when you first look at it you think, how the heck does this fasten? Take my word for it, you won't be happy with the instructions. It seems the small ends of the metal pieces get forced through a hole on the opposing ends and both metal pieces should be secured as just one slips off easily. The 2 cents that it would have taken to confirm this by including a brief diagram would have been nice. If you try to stretch the hole over one of the large ends, you will damage the belt. It does work reasonably well but it does feel odd at first.Now lets talk about $7.95 shipping which is a total rip off. Even if this product works, don't buy it here with the outrageous shipping."
5,Great product,Nice accessory. Keeps clothes neat and shirts tucked in. Double fasteners are mandatory to extend the life of the belt.
1,Disappointing,"I was very interested in this story after reading the description and some of the reviews. However, I found the overall experience to be disappointing.The description of the heroine's frustration with her deafness was interesting and very realistic, but the storyline was very patchy--with huge holes in it.The actual ""treasure"" hunts were very episodic, with no details beyond...""the murky water"", etc.....the villains were never fully developed, and after reading the final solution to the suspense, I could only say, ""Duh, What happened?""I have read other of Rachel Lee/Sue Civil-Brown's books and enjoyed them. But I cannot recommend this book."
5,Overview of DVD,"Length:: 5:42 MinsFairwinds Publishing has produced this video to give you a brief overview of what this Book on DVD contains, this way you can make an informed decision regarding the purchase of this DVD. We would like to thank Amazon for this unique opportunity to share our thoughts with you.""The Secrets of Stopping Heart Disease""""The Secrets of Stopping Diabetes""""The Secrets of Curing Your Disease""""The Secrets of What is Hypnosis""""The Secrets of Why Hypnosis Doesn't Work!""""The Secrets of Healing thru Nutrition""""The Secrets of Weight Loss""""The Secrets of the Poisoning of America""""The Secrets of Stopping Allergies""""The Secrets of Stopping Pain"""
5,Wow! What a great read . . .,"Finally, something new on the Zodiac case! Not only new, but different and compelling. There's something here for everyone. If you're new to this unsolved serial murder case, this book will give you the straight facts in a great read. If you already know the case, it will give you a completely different perspective -- one that makes a lot of sense and is compelling.Good job!"
2,"In the end, though interesting, the book doesn't add anything to the literature about the case","A strange book. Starting with an engaging premise - the author worked with the Chair of the Psychology Dept. at Sonoma State University to create a profile based on Zodiac's letters to various newspapers - Michael Kelleher proceeds to swamp his book with potboiler-level prose. The psychologist, David Van Nuys' analyses maintain a degree of detachment that I appreciate with this sort of book, but his conclusions don't aid in understanding of the case or its perpetrator. Most of Van Nuys' conclusions seem facile, on the order of ""He must have had a terrible childhood. Perhaps he was abused. He had great rage toward women and fear of male authority figures"". In the end, though interesting, the book doesn't add anything to the literature about the case."
1,Speculation vs. Insight,"Although this book does a fair job of representing the facts in the case, it is still filled with glaring errors that any real Zodiac investigator can spot in a heartbeat. The only reason I give this book a 1 star rating is because of David Van Nuys contribution. Otherwise, this book is a waste of money. Read Robert Graysmith's seminal classic, ""Zodiac"" instead. Its conclusions are much more insightful and far less speculative than those found in this particular work."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"This book is a great companion to R. Graysmith's classic, ""Zodiac"". Comparing the two, this book is a lot less speculative and their analysis of the killer is shockingly original and rooted in the facts of the case (what few there are). They have breathed new life into this seemingly unsolvable mystery; although there is no excuse for his heinous crimes, one almost has a little sympathy for the Zodiac, who sometimes appears quite pathetic, being probably lost in a tormented hell of mental disease stemming from childhood trauma. A must read!"
5,"""This Is The Zodiac Speaking"": Into The Mind Of A Serial Killer","I enjoyed this book written on one of the most elusive, and enigmatic of serial killers in the annals of American crime history. I felt that the thoughtful and analytical commentaries of Dr. Van Nuys and Michael Kelleher illuminated the mindset of the man known as 'Zodiac'. This is not a sensationalistic read, neither capitalizing or glorifying the cold and calculated murders of the coward-psychopath who sought attention taunting the public through his communiques with the SFPD and media. Each of Zodiac's letters are presented in chronological order, first interpreted by Dr. Van Nuys and then Michael Kelleher. Each offered their own opinion as to what and why they thought the content of the letters meant in relation to Zodiac's mind set, sometimes offering different opinions on the same letters. A very good read for those seeking to gain understanding and insight into the psychopathic mindset of Zodiac."
4,Expensive But Worth It,This is an interesting take on the granddaddy of all true crimes. I was fascinated. I wish I could read it again for the first time.
5,A GREAT READ!,"Canadian resident Paul William Roberts is the equivelant of Joseph Campbell on Dave Barry. His theological background makes him the perfect medium for culture comparisons. He also has a modern day wit, perhaps borrowed from Hunter S. Thompson, but intergated into this tale of tragedy and woe so seamlessly that it kept me reading even through the history lessons that I may have snoozed through ordinarilly. Altogether a very different take on Iraq than the majority of the western world is used to. Buy it."
2,A mixed bag,"A disturbing, vivid and often funny account of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The author labors a little too hard to immitate Hunter S. Thompson's Gonzo Journalism style. I simply don't believe some of his escapades. I was very disturbed by the author's comparison of Israelis to Nazis while he discusses Iraq's raining of scud missles on civilians in Tel Aviv."
2,A mixed bag,"A disturbing, vivid and often funny account of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The author labors a little too hard to immitate Hunter Thompson's Gonzo Journalism style. I simply don't believe some of his escapades. Most disturbing is the author's comparison of Israelis to Nazis while he discusses Iraq's raining of scud missles on civilians in Tel Aviv."
2,Pointless and void of history,"Mr. Roberts, for a man who supposedly spend time in Iraq, seems to be oblivious to historical facts all for the sake of being cynical and cute. I found his writing absolutely on a very low level. His writing ability reminds me of some of the pathetic attempts by some of our great authors of the 60's. They were so engrossed in smashing people in the mouth with their political beliefs and disgust with America that the rest of the sheep on our campuses would embrace such nonsense as being scholarly and thought provoking. Roberts wants to review this very serious situation in Iraq as sort of a ""Catcher in the Rye"" while discussing butchery."
1,A Somewhat Funny Leftist Screed,"This is my second attempt to review this book. The first was never posted. I don't know why because I didn't violate any of Amazon's guidelines.Anyway, the Demonic Comedy is at times a witty book. Unfortunately, it is also a flat out screaming attack against the ""evil"" West with the United States standing above the pack as villain number one.I was very disappointed with this book. I felt the author made excessive fun of the difficulty his Arab friends had with English to the point where it was difficult to read parts of the book. I was also put off by his use of bizarre anti-Gulf War quotations (most by extrremist feminists with a rather peculiar outlook on life).Don't buy this book. I returned my copy."
3,"An engaging, though spotty, account of his Iraqi adventure","Probably the only journalist ever to have interviewed Saddam Hussein while stoned on ecstasy--Roberts, that is, not Hussein!--Roberts paints a chilling portrait of an Iraq thirty or so years into the Hussein regime. The book is very funny in parts, but there's terror behind the canvas that Roberts covers with his amusing anecdotes. I found some of the treatment spotty and some jibes needlessly cruel, but on the whole, an entertaining account."
3,"Funny, interesting, flawed","Funny because Roberts has a strong sense of the absurd.Interesting because he makes up his own mind about the situation in Iraq.Flawed because he insists on spelling out every accent he hears, a device that is both condescending and tiresome. (His editor seems to have told him this, as after a few pages he makes an unconvincing claim to the effect that he is not actually laughing at the fact that non-native speakers of English don't all speak flawless English)."
4,"Funny book , sad situation.","The Demonic Comedy is a series of trips through Iraq with Canadian journalist Paul Roberts. His topic is serious, but the dark humour he finds on his journeys makes this book more accessible to the jaded modern reader. Most of us don't want to read the normal, boring, and self-important [stuff] that ""reporters"" churn out about their days in the Inter-Continental Hotels of the world's hotspots.I'd highly recommend his book.The only bad things I can say is that the US and the UK still want to bomb those poor [people] that hate Saddam as much as anyone. Plus, my copy had a few print setting and typographical errors but nothing horrible.Try to find this book!"
5,Safari Wings of World Bald Eagle Figure,"This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for a senior citizen who collects bald eagles.They absolutely loved it! So, that made me very happy. The package arrived on time andit was exactly like the picture advertized. I would recommend this product and woulddefinitely purchase items from this company again."
1,Fragile!,I bought a pair of these a while back and was disapointed. I had them on for maybe 10 minutes before they developed a run all the way up the leg. Total waste of money.
2,size wrong,"Unless you are slender do not buy these nylons. They are horrible in the upper legs, very tight, no give at all."
4,you can't beat this Hi Def stereo for the price,I finally replace my old Kenwood CD/Stereo. I was looking for something which would allow me to play my Ipod and MP3 player as well as regular CD's and data CDs. I almost overlooked the Hi Def radio. This DUAL has it all and the price is great. I live on my boat so this is it for my music. I was using the FM transmitter that they sell to play MP3s thru the car stereo but it was horrible. The High Def stations are great and I am in an area where there are plenty of them sometimes as many as 3 to a station the clarity is unbelieveable. I am now going to get one for my car.
2,Worked fine and then NOPE!,"The radio worked great for about 8 months, but then it started glitching causing some buttons to do other things if I had a USB plugged in. That wasn't a big deal, but then the AUX port wouldn't work unless you held the cable in a certain way, which it stopped all together one day (I tried more then one cable. The faceplate get extremely wobbly after some time and sometimes when I click the 'Next' button, it will go backwards to the previous song.Overall, it was a good radio while it lasted, but it just has to many problems now and I can't even return it.you have all been warned >_>"
1,"Full of Features, Unfortunately They Don't Work","The Dual XHD7720 seems like a feature rich, high end unit with all the bells and whistles. After using it for two days I'm returning it, however, because it simply DOESN'T WORK correctly. The unit would crash after 20-40 minutes of use and either forget which buttons did what or become unresponsive. Shoddy is the only word I can use to describe this unit. Also, the remote didn't work.I've never been as frustrated at a product as I have about the XHD7720, and I'm never going to buy anything made by Dual again.I also used the BTM60 Bluetooth module with it, it worked well for about 10 minutes before losing connection with my iphone. I don't know if that was a fault of the XHD7720 or the BTM60. I'm not going to buy another Dual radio to try it out with though."
2,Great at first but now it's going downhill,"We loved this radio when we first bought it. Great deal, great quality, and sounded good. Now the buttons don't work. First it was just the mode button but it has moved to the sound control and other buttons.....thank goodness it came with remote but that sucker was so small it's already gone...."
1,stopped working after 1 year 3 months,I had a bad feeling when this unit arrived. Worked ok for a while then after about 9 months various buttons started malfunctioning. Very cheap parts. the most cheap feeling stereo I have ever purchased. I wish I went with my gut and returned this piece of garbage in the beginning. I have since bought a pioneer deh 4300 and it works great. If you have an ipod the pioneer 4300 works great with it. I have an ipod touch. I wish I went with the pioneer in the beginning instead this unit. I wanted hd radio. It works alright but I live in orange county just south of L.A. It cuts out enough to be annoying. Factor that in with the extremely cheap radio its housed in and one year later its done. Not surprising it broke so fast when you see how cheap this thing is made. As far as hd radio goes when its not cutting out it sounds great. I think I will wait until they get hd radio working better before I go this route again. Dual should be ashamed of making radios this bad.
2,great but doent last>>>>>,this stereo cought my eye wt its oening and closeing feacher after like 2 weeks in my car i was driving on the highway and out of no where it started blazing up so i pulled it out and later i rewird it and it worked for like 2 months and now it sends the vollume up and down on my amps >>>>>>>>>> omg thiss thig sucks after like 3 weeks it only opens when it fills like it =( fail ow welll >>>>>>>>>>>>
1,crapppppppppppp,this thing is crap do not buy...........went thru 3 units in 2 years one broke within 6 months one came bad when i replaced it (warranty) just got another one and the front of the unit gets stuck..............
1,Hackneyed and poorly paced,"This was a slow, dragging read with unappealing characters and a molasses-slow plot. I am somewhat amazed so many respectable periodicals are slobbering over it - I recommend that people skip or read earlier Wambaugh, which is indeed fine stuff."
1,A big disappointment,"Normally I love Wambaugh's work, but I found this book very disappointing. I thought the dialog was stilted, the pacing slow and the plot boring. I brought this book on a 12 hour plane ride, and finished it because I had no choice - but it made for a very disappointing read."
2,This was a poorly written book.,I believe that this book was very poorly written. It had a slow moving plot and the ending was dull. It had a good story line but as I said it moved to slow. There is better literature to be reading.
4,Classic Wambaugh,"Perhaps not his very best work but the familiar and welcome style, angsty villains, mixed up, wise-cracking cops. It was nice to be able to read an item which is currently not in print in the UK but i'm sure it should get a UK release."
3,"A FINE, FUN READ.","Snappily written, fast paced and witty. Joseph Wambaugh is funny and ceaselessly inventive."
4,Carroll Rip-Off or Trbute?,"If you've read any of Jeff Noon's other novels, you know that he's maniacally brilliant and quite off-the-wall. Automated Alice doesn't do anything to dissuade readers of that notion.Noon tries, rather successfully in my opinion, to write a third Alice story...one in which she finds herself in present day Manchester, England after climbing through a grandfather clock. Noon uses Carroll's fine use of language and wordplay to create this very entertaining story which does fit into the Manchester he created with Pollen and Vurt.This is a story written as only Noon could write it. Some will say it's a rip-off and a poor imitation of Carroll but I think it's a great tribute and a fun read."
3,Worthwhile for Alice/Carroll fans,"As a fan of Lewis Carroll's Wonderland/Looking-Glass/Under Ground, and as one who has never heard of Jeff Noon before, I found this book funny and clever, and a good & worthwhile addition to my Alice collection. Although it is a fairly light, fast read, it isn't quite a children's book -- more designed for adults who enjoy Alice."
3,"An underground delight, yet doesn't live up to Vurt","Reworked in a fashion only Noon could invent, the beloved Alice finds herself in a place just as unfamiliar as any Wonderland. Noon's ability to create characters with the quirky appeal and intrigue of a children's novel and yet maintain a theme so subtly subversive and controversial has made him a favorite of mine, and this book definitely has its share of quirk. Unfortunately, the book read quickly and was not as absorbing as Vurt was. Some bits of this book were so amazingly clever, while other moments, such as the development of Alice's character in this new world, the feeling of the grimey Manchester Noon wishes to portray, are as lost as Alice in this remake of Carroll's classic. Read with caution... If you're a Noon beginner, start with Vurt. If you're a dedicated fan, read it with an open mind. You just might love it."
3,A nice break from the norm.,"I really liked the story line, although some crucial parts seemed to be thrown together, almost as if there was little planning in the detailed plot. Much word play helped to liven the story, some too subtle to notice at first. Overall, an interesting tale with a famous main character"
2,Not like the original,"I didn't like this book. Though it is undeinably clever,it is so aware of it's own cleverness that it seems bothcontrived and largely unfunny. In addition, unlike Carroll'swork, much of the humor is low, based on various body partsand the secretions thereof. If you like that sort ofthing, you'll undoubtedly find this book funnier than I did."
1,Good bedtime reading...,"Noon is not Carroll, alas, and his language-play is nowhere as delightful and to-the-point. A very basic adventure-game plot is not even disguised by intolerably frequent - and quite poor - puns and jokes, that make the book almost intolerable to read. I can only recommend it as a sleeping aid: you can't stay awake for more than 2 pages."
3,Not bad but thankful it's a quick read.,"I had seen this book at stores many times, thought the cover looked cool but I didn't buy it because, you know, ""never judge a book ..."" Well, I later found it at a discount store for $1 so I got it. It's not bad but it reads real fast--I read it in 2 afternoons. I admit, I found some of the author's intrusions annoying and at times, outright stupid but ... Jeff Noon gets an ""E"" for effort and for thinking of the idea. I would recommend picking this book up on discount or from the library only."
1,Just avoid this book,"You can tell the author is very intelligent, but enough with the made up words. He should have worked harder on making up a plot for this book. I couldn't even make myself finish this boring book."
4,"Good record, great cause","I really enjoyed this record and the proceeds go to a great cause. (Moveon.org is the best thing to happen to politics in a long time.) It's got 22 tracks so its a good value for your money. I particularly enjoyed the David Byrne, Flaming Lips, and Old 97 tracks."
3,I bought it for the R.E.M. song...,"But it's so encouraging to see so many artists lending songs to this collection.""Final Straw"" by R.E.M. ALONE is worth the price of the album in my opinion. One of Michael Stipes most heartfelt songs. I hope it's released as a single and that it receives some air time near Election Day."
3,a question,where is the Iron and Wine song that the reviewer wrote about? mine doesn't have anything by him on it
5,Wonderful Father's Day Gift,"I just heard from my Mom and Dad and my Mom told me that the Lobsters arrived at 11:00 a.m. and they were done eating at 12:15 p.m. She said she had never seen my father so happy to receive a gift. They told me the Lobsters were wonderful, packaged well and arrived safely and on time at their door step. Apparently my father asked my mother ""why don't we spoil ourselves more often?"" I guess it's the children's time to spoil the parents! So, if you want to give someone (including yourself) a very special and fun gift, don't hesitate! Order these lobsters!"
1,Refused to ship despite exorbitant shipping cost,"I order a lobster bake for my parent's anniversary every year. The vendor I normally use closed in the bad economy, so I tried Lobsters Online through Amazon. What a poor experience! I placed my order, putting up with the $44 shipping cost to Hawaii. Days later, I received an email telling me that they couldn't ship to the specified location. Since I do this every year, I know it's not a problem to ship lobsters to Hawaii, and for $44, they can't be taking a loss on the shipping. Nowhere on their page does it say they don't ship to Hawaii - yet they refuse to do so with no explanation. This has caused me to have to scramble to get a new, comparable gift for my parent's 40th anniversary on very short notice. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VENDOR."
4,Seems to be working,"I have chronically chapped lips and most balms (especially ones with sunscreen) cause my lips to peel within hours. I haven't used this long enough to tell whether it will actually heal my lips, but it definitely hasn't caused instant chapping. As others have said, it's kind of thick and white, so only use a little and spread it around well."
1,leaves lips white,"This lip stuff feels good going on, but the stark white color never goes away. Makes one look like Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed--tragedy. I don't even want to wear it when I'm alone. Even just lotion is better, at least the white effect disappears then."
4,Good product.,"This doesn't have any smell nor did it have preservatives that I prefer avoiding. I can't avoid having ""whitening"" effect for having ingredients for sunblock, but other than that, it is fine and this is gentle enough for my toddlers as well."
5,I recommend all Vanicream products.,I recommend all Vanicream products. I have extremly sensitive skin and this is the only really safe product line that I trust
4,Abnormal Psychology in a Changing World,"Cover a little frayed but otherwise good shape, no highlighting or ledger notes.Abnormal Psychology in a Changing World. by Rathus, Greene, Nevid."
3,meh,"Can't say a whole lot; it's an Abnormal Psychology text book that I needed for class. The price was right and shipping was great. I used it for the semester and then offloaded it, the book itself was easy to understand and more of an in-depth, yet entry level look at abnormal behaviours. As far as the class itself... I was disappointed that it was more addiction focused, and threw PTSD into the mix (I have my own opinions as to that topic, namely that it is a NORMAL reaction to ABNORMAL circumstances) but glossed over the ""Psycho"" ""12 Monkeys"" crazies."
1,Item fine seller NOT,After ordering this book I tried multiple times to cancell this order before it was even shipped the seller decided to still ship this book to me and charge me. Not only could i not use this book but i would have lost more money trying to send it back as they state they can take a portion or re-stocking fee. This seller will definetly stick out as one NOT to use
4,Good review,This product was a good find for me and was everything that I hoped it would be. I will definitely make similar purchased in the future.
2,Not what I thought it was,"When I ordered this movie I thought I was ordering a movie my child could sit and dance with nonstop like it said. I was expecting dance songs and dance moves and was ready to boogy. Sadly this is just a DVD with two episodes fom each character in which they may sing a song but it's a regular episode with no dancing and just a chance of song in it. Although she loves to watch it causentheybare here favorite shows, they should have just made it a movie of different episodes and not promote it as a dancing video of nonstop dancing for the little one, there was no dancing at all."
4,Just got it today- big hit,The little ones haven't stopped dancing and singing to this DVD. It is a bunch of episodes of the shows shown on the front cover. It's not all dancing all the way through. Still good but slightly misleading.
3,Not much dance music,"Advertised as dance music - but is really just a collection of Nick, Jr. episodes - and not very musical ones."
2,I did not like it.,I was looking for more of a dance video. This has too much story line and not enough music. If you are looking for short stories you might like this video..
4,great video,love the video but not sure if it got scratched in shipping or when we opened it..they are all great episodes and is great for car rides!
4,dora dora dora,Again I bought this for my granddaughter and she enjoys all of the Dora movies she has so if you have a little girl I would recommend this movie
3,Kids liked it!,"Both my 5 yr. old and 2 yr. old grand-daughters liked this, but just didn't really love it. They watched it once and haven't asked to watch it again. I say it's good- just not great."
2,Caveat to scholars.,"A cross-cultural study should have a bibliography and footnotes/endnotes, so this is a caveat to scholars of East Asian history and the Pacific war in general: this book has neither, nor does it account for its sources, other than to offer ""recommended readings."" Since most of the works cited there are familiar, it's hard to say how much of the material here is original."
2,Not Representative,"Gould is a magnificent pianist and when he nails a work, he brings life and meaning to it in ways other pianists could only dream about. On this CD however, the approach taken on many of these pieces seems to defy the spirit of the youthful Beethoven. Beethoven was a virtuoso in his early days and it is hard to imagine the young fiery pianist taking the pieces of Opus 2 at the extremely slow tempo's Gould selects here. Any other performer (Brendel, Goode, A. Fischer) will give you a better representative performance of these pieces. Too make matters worse, when playing the Moonlight sonata Movement one, Gould decides to rush things! I must state again, I love Gould overall but he does not do these pieces justice here in regards to the composers intentions. Also, there are no liner notes."
3,Not as good as Caballo de Troya I,"Caballo de Troya II is not a bad book, but it has the missfortune to be compared with a masterpiece like Caballo de Troya I. The second book is quite more tedious and it is focused much more in the organization of the second trip rather than the major's new experiences in Israel. I do not blame the author, because as I said before, it is very difficult to surpass such a great book as Caballo de Troya I, but frankly, the second part should have been more imaginative."
1,Cute Idea-Poor Execution,"I ordered the RC Skateboard Flyer as a gift for my son. It's a cute idea with lots of promise. But, when we loaded the batteries into it, it wouldn't work. I finally got it to work by placing a shim under the positive contact on one of the batteries. I also had to resolder the spring on the negative side of the battery, after it fell out.Once we got it going, it still operates oddly. When you turn it on, it immediately goes in one direction, without any input from the remote control. The remote only sends it in reverse. You ""control"" it by toggling back and forth from forward to reverse. So, about the only thing it does is spin around...endlessly. Not too exciting to play with.Stuff like this could give ""Made in China"" a bad reputation."
3,THE BOY AND THE BEANSTALK,Jim and the BeanstalkRay BriggsI'm rating this book with three stars.This book is related to math.The book is related to mathbeacause of the rulers andthe big bright gold coins.I like the book but notthat much.It is a good book butit would be good bookfor three yaer-old.
5,Always,"I've worn this scent since the day it was first available. Love, Love, Love it. It really makes me feel ""beautiful"". I once thought I'd lost it but have always been able to track it down, most currently at Amazon. Thank you."
4,JVC HAE170W Ear Clip Headphones with Retractable Cord (White),"Exactly what I was looking for. The retractable cord makes them great for exercising, and they are small enough to stick in my purse and carry around with me wherever I go."
4,Small yet Powerful,"It is extremely small, but it's a great player. It can be used to transfer data, as well as play music, and it has voice recording and an FM tuner. My one complaint is the lack of playlists; to group songs, they must be in folders on the file system, making putting a song in multiple playlists a pain. Although the screen is small, it can still display all the essential information. It can hold a lot of music if you use the included Creative Audio Converter to convert to a lower bit rate (I use 64 kbps MP3). Oh, and it can't read ID3v2.2 tags (what iTunes uses) so if you use iTunes, your song titles may not display correctly; instead, the filenames will be displayed. Also, the limited file format support is a downside (supports MP3, WAV (not a good idea), and some WMA (not protected)). Overall, a great player, but definately not in the same class as the Apple iPod."
1,If I could give zero stars I would,"I am a long-time listener/viewer/collector of all things jazz. This is, by far , the worst jazz video out there. I am not going to waste my time even giving you the details on this why I think this way. I was suckered in on this video -hoping for the best. Don't make the same mistake that I did. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
1,Alerted Too Late,"Wish I read the customer reviews before I wasted money on this dawg! Boy do I feel ripped off! Stay away, stay away, stay away! I wish someone would play misty for me, because I get misty eyed when I think of the money I wasted on this dvd. Total sham, it may keep me from ever attending the Monterey Jazz Festival."
1,0 stars is just what this movie deserves!,Total rip-off. A promo movie with an endless chatter about howgreat the Monterey Festival is. No great performances and very little music. Pass this one.
3,Dissapointing,Looks and sounds more like a tourist information campaign than a thorough review of the legendary musical material that was presented and performed all those years.
2,Slim on performance,"An interesting history lesson, but just not enough on the performance side, which is really too bad. Unless one is a MJF freak I'd spend my money elsewhere."
1,"A disc for music historians, not music .","If you are expecting some wonderful vintage performances from this disc, you are wasting your time. There are no musical performances on this disc. Just a bunch of people talking about the history of the festival. Instead of getting to watch Mile Davis or Lady Day, we are treated to a discussion with the lady who put the rolls of toilet paper in the johns!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This was a true disappointment."
1,Too much people talking and few people playing,"I purchased that DVD to see and to hear jazz music, instead ofthat I saw and I heard a lot of people saying how good were those 40years."
1,Clint Eastwood should be ashamed!,"Clint Eastwood should be ashamed to have executive produced such a piece of garbage. The other reviews are on the money. I was so disappointed in how falsely the cover art and commentary (mis)represent the actual content of this video that I complained to Warner Home Video and forced Circuit City to let me exchange the DVD for a different one. If you're looking to hear some good Jazz, look elsewhere."
1,I wish it were possible to give this DVD 0 stars,"I echo everyone else's sentiments about this DVD. It's notfor Jazz fans. I don't know who the intended audience is. But ifyou're expecting to see some complete performances from this legendary festival, look elsewhere. If you want informative commentary about the music, look elsewhere."
5,The perfect cutting board,"Seems crazy that anyone would shop around for two months to find just the right cutting board, but that was me! I couldn't go into a grocery store, or any of the local super stores without heading for the cutting boards. I didn't know how particular I was; didn't even know I had a set of ""requirements"" until I kept not liking any of them. When I entered ""cutting boards"" at the Amazon website, it was like someone had read my mind. The Oneida cutting board with two handles looked perfect. Quick delivery, great price & perfect product. An excellent shopping experience."
2,Poor Quality Control,"I bought two of these and they were both warped.Here's why the warp matters...If you lay it warp up, juices run off of it. If you lay it warp down so juices don't run off, the rubber ends don't contact the counter and it just slips and spins.I would say buying one and expecting it to be made right is a gamble."
5,Half Past Autumn - The Life and Works of Gordon Parks,Awesome. Gordon Parks is a quiet and little known American Icon. One that should never be forgotten.
2,Did Not Last,"The car-bra was delivered in a timely manner. It was installed and looked great. However it only lasted 30 days before it started to rip, we repaired the first rip...then within the week we got another rip in another location. You get what you pay for."
3,Nice but get the full album,Loved the CD. Played it over and over again the night I received it. Very nice take on the Wall and well thought out and executed. Would be a 4 or 5 instead of a 3. . .BUT there is another out CD there by Luther Wright & The Wrongs that contains 13 more songs from the Wall and includes all of the material on this one. It is called Rebuild the Wall as opposed to Rebuild the Wall Part 1. Don't end up like me and have to buy the other album as well!
5,Spenco Rx Ball of Foot,"Bought a pair of Spenco Rx Ball of Foot Medium pads - they're OK and seem to work better when you insert them in your tennis shoes.. not as comfortable when wearing high heels pumps,a little high, perhaps I should have bought the size small."
2,Feels like walking on a stone,After wearing these in my shoes for about 45min it goes from feeling good to feeling like you have a rocks in your shoes. They are just to thick and hard to be able to wear them for any lenght of time. Price was right but product hurts.
5,Immediate releaf!,"I ALSO HAVE Morton's Neuroma and purchased these based upon Amazon reviews. Yes, there are no instructions but if you study them it becomes obvious when you try to put them in a shoe. My Morton's Neuroma was so bad that every step felt like an electric shock on my foot. I put the pads in my shoes and tried them. It felt really strange at first but as I walked, I had no pain or electric shocks!I'm very pleased with the result and plan on purchasing several more for all my shoes.\"
3,Not For Me,"These are my first pair of insoles so maybe I am naive when it comes to this but so far I have not been able to wear them. Sometimes they are too big to put into sandals and they show. Other times they take up too much space inside my shoe to wear I can't hardly get my feet into them. Also they are only cushy in a circle area in the middle which is also too high compared to the rest of it which makes it uncomfortable for me. I need something a little smaller, and flatter, and more contoured (or evenly spread out). These just put too much pressue in one small area of my foot and the cushion is almost too firm for me. Only good thing I can say is they seem to stay in place, when I try them on around the house. Maybe these weren't made for women?"
4,Liked item but order was incorrect,Just received my order of Spenco Rx Ball of Foot supports. I think they are what I was looking for but I was charged for the two pairs that I ordered and only received one pr. The computer system makes it difficult to find the correct link to get assistance in this matter.
2,was not pleased with the Spenco pads,"I wasn't real pleased with these pads. There were no instructions as to how they were to be inserted in the shoe and in fact I felt the pain in my foot was worse. When I took my 4 mile walk, I had to stop twice, once to adjust the pad and after about 3 miles, had to finally remove the pad. Very disappointed, especially after reading other reviews from people that loved them. As for me, I would never buy them again."
3,"Confusing, but comfortable","This item did not come with instructions on how to place these in your shoes. The shape is somewhat awkward and positioning is difficult, but once in place they serve their purpose. They are a little thick, so these do not work well in snug shoes! Overall, they did help with the ache in the ball-of-foot area."
5,Spenco Rx ball of foot,"I recently started a job that requires me to be on my feet for 8 -10 hours a day on a concrete floor. At 49 my feet were killing me especially the balls of my feet.I tried everything I could buy at stores but could not find anything that would help much, untill I tried these Spenco's.Wow, what a difference. These things are a godsend. They are well built, they stay in my Red Wing boots without moving and you can tell they will last a long time. I no longer have the ball of foot pain that I had, now its just my back pain I have to deal with :).I am getting a second pair for my tennis shoes for the long walks in the mall. They fit im my boots and tennis shoes.I wear a size 9 mens, and got the medium insert, its the right size for me."
3,simply Painting Across the US Vol 2,"I gave this item 3 stars, not because of the DVD, but because the packaging is so misleading. It shows paint brushes. I called Amazon prior to purchasing this item to make sure that the brushes in the DVD were going to be got-hair like Frank Clark uses. The lady was extremely helpful and told me that they were got-hair so I placed my order. Imagine my surprise when the DVD arrived and I did not get any brushes. So I called back to Amazon and another CS representative informed me that the brushes were not in the package. Told me I can return the DVD. I am still deciding as I really like the DVD but shame on Frank Clark for using packaging that shows brushes beside the DVD as if they are included. And I guess shame on CS with Amazon that told me they were included and were made of got-hair."
1,poor quality with a ridicoulsely big battery,I bought 8 months ago and now it has 2 or 3 problems that I need to send back to SONY for repair. Not a good product to buy
1,"Terrible battery life, non existant support","Also had a problem with the battery only running about 45 minutes at best, now it only lasts about 30 minutes. Tried to resolve the issue with support and they would not address the problem. Technical support knows less about PC than I do. Do not pay for this laptop at any price, and think twice if someone is giving it to you."
5,Excellent Tie Dyed Sock,"When we have to lifeguard on cold days in sweats, we need socks to keep our feet warm while still being able to make a rescue in them. Wanting a fun sock to wear with our uniforms, we chose the Red Lion Revolution in red and navy. That was a decade ago, and we are still buying them for guards. The sock dye is very colorfast and does not run. The large size 10-12.5 is nice and wide to fit over thicker calves comfortably. They also tend to go over the knee for added warmth. And they do last many season of walking around in sand and getting wet. The guards often wear them without their sweatpants just for fun and comfort. We've tried other types of tie dye kneesocks, but they were too short and too tight around the calf, and we always ended up going back to the Red Lion Revolutions."
1,Nothing says you love your family like artificially flavoring their baked goods,A giant bottle of murky liquid that tastes (kinda) like vanilla and lemon and possibly other unspecified flavors. What could possibly go wrong? You may want to consider using vanilla and lemons instead.
2,It might be helping but it's not preventing or killing,"It doesn't seem to be stopping new red slime growth or killing any that exists. I have used the Ultralife Reef Red Slime Remover with success though. - However, the Ultralife Reef Red Slime Remover claims to be enough for 300 gallons but it's only enough for 250 if you measure it according to their specifications.The underlying problem of red slime comes from too much food, silicates or other pollution. Keep this in mind when you are treating for Red slime. - eliminate it's food source, then treat."
5,old school is still just fine!,25 yrs of competitive mtb...I race both shimano and sram cassettes - for the life of me I can't tell the difference in terms of function and wear. I ride big ring 95% of the time and I'll replace my 44t 3 times for every one of these which I seem to replace about every 2500 mtb miles. Even though its old school @ 9s these days I still think it's pretty!
4,Too bad they didn't get another reader,"The story and writing in this book are very well done. Unfortunately, they picked the wrong person to read it. Ms. Dickinson's reading is monotone and lifeless, which detracts from the actual story. I would recommend the book itself, but perhaps you'd prefer reading it on your own."
5,great show,"Great show, this is far better than man vs wild i am glad Les Stroud is back this show shows you how to survive in the wild, love it!"
3,good show a bit pixlated at times,I really enjoy the Survivor Man series and own the original show on DVD. This new show is just as good and Les continues on his great work by applying his knowledge and skills in a way you can feel like that could be you. There is no drama and careless behavior like running down hillsides and jumping off clifts like in other shows only to add drama and danger.My only complaint would be with the quality of the video as sometimes it gets pixelated and I don't have that with other downloaded shows or movies on my kindle.
5,still the best,"Realistic, fun and educational. He's still the best 'survivor man'. I really like how spends 10 days in each place and it's spread over 2 episodes. You get a better feel for the land, it's beauty and how to survive there."
2,Cheap but gets the job done,"I knew going into this that it wasnt the best, but i expected it to at least work with out issues. I had a dual stereo before and figured i would buy another one to replace my stolen one but once it was connected i realized dial to turn up the volume only would turn it down. if it wasnt for the remote it comes with then i would have just returned it and gone with a jvc or pioneer."
5,LOVE THIS !,"Works great ! bought this for my boyfriend,as the first player I got him from Dual, died...so I got thim this and he was so excited, he couldnt wait to install it, so he installed at at 2am ! That's to tell u how happy he was...For the price, u cant go wrong at all !"
4,great for price,"This radio is absolutely great! I have had it for a couple weeks now and no probs! There is only one down side, which is i wish the the front would go down further to where the screen is more visible! But overall, good radio!"
5,Great Head Unit!,Ive had this head unit for 2 months now and it works great in my accord. It matches with my interior led glow i got installed on the floor board. Brings a lot of attention also you can take off the face plate so no one can steal your radio which is a must. It really brings out the sound quality in your speakers and i got 6.5 and 6x9 kenwood kfcs. I also have 2 12inch kenwood subwoofers pushing 2000 watts in total. The sound settings on this head unit make it crisp and clear and brings out that base you want. Its a great buy especially for the value of this head unit
2,you get what you pay for,instruction came in French I believe Specs. look good but that it lasted a couple days and it died not worth the time and money to get warranty to cover it
5,Netter's Anatomy Flash Cards,"An excellent learning aid. These are good quality cards, easy to view, good graphic images well identified. Also they are very useful as a reference source."
4,Netter anatomy flash cards,I think this is a great resource for anatomy. Excellent buy and I would recommend it to all anatomy students both in medical school and other health professions
4,Almost perfect condition...,Im starting my pre-reqs for my RN this fall and. These are going to be great for studying with some of the other students in my Anatomy and Physiology classes.
2,Kaplans are better,"I just got these and they are so confusing. Our Anatomy class book's chapters are broken down by system. These cards are broken down by location, i.e. head, neck, etc. Even The Anatomy Coloring book is better since it's also broken down by system, i.e. muscles, nerves, etc. The Netter flash cards don't even have anything on anatomical planes, sections or directions. That stuff is the most basic stuff that is taught in every beginning anatomy class!"
3,Netter's Anatomy Flash Cards,I am a mathematics Lecturer in a Delhi College. I purchased these Flash cards as gift Item for my daughter who has recently joined a medical college in India. Today she recieved this gift.So I am just giving her comments:1. Good for quick Review2. Figures are good not great3. Text is in small prints bigger ones must have been made some difference4. Card size must be a little bigger5. But I have already Netter's Atlas so I can consult itAbove all not a bad puchase.
4,Good investment,"If you have a gross anatomy lab where you are identifying prosected cadavers there is no better way to study than sight recognition. The cards were however slightly incomplete with some of the more specific structures mentioned in the text, not specifically mentioned in the note cards. Nothing a little ball point editing can't fix! Sufficient for first year of medical/graduate school anatomy but probably not beyond.Blessings!Joshua"
4,Good but missing some pieces,Good for visual breakdown of regions and layers. Studying for PT a little more challenging as muscles get grouped and can be difficult to decipher origins and insertion in large block of text. A few muscles not included.
2,This is obselete if you have the CD,The flash card for anatomy are a little old school with the new products that are out there. The Netter people have come up with a CD that allows you to create your own test images and that is way more valuable than this cards. At first I though the cards would be helpful and they were but once I switched to the digital media this product became dead weight.
5,Anatomy flash cards,Awesome! Service great arrived in timely fashion. This product is more than advertised. Very pleased.
5,great information & graphics,Great graphics and information. I love the ring that comes with the flash cards- it makes them very portable.
4,Anatomy Flash Cards,These are very good cards to have for human physiology as well as anatomy. Very detailed though. Maybe more detail than needed but still a very handy thing to have for memorization.
3,A good starting point,"I just finished my first year in medical school, and I thought these cards were a good starting point for studying. Often it's hard to motivate yourself to learn all the mundane details required in gross anatomy, and these flash cards were great to carry around on the bus and review during my commute.However, these cards do not have all the information that is in the Netter's atlas or textbooks like Moore's Clinically Oriented Anatomy. These cards only review some bony landmarks, muscles, nerves, etc., but not all of them! So if you know these flash cards, don't fool yourself into thinking you know everything for your exam!"
3,Almost there,Cards are nice and portable. Great pictures. Two faults: #1 The cards only show anterior and posterior views of muscles and their insertions/origins. Some of the muscles require lateral views to see the proper insertions. #2 The online product is EXACTLY the same as the cards. There are NO three dimensional views here. You spend $35 and you think they could at least provide that on the website.
5,Gross Review,"These are great for review in Gross Anatomy. The back of the cards describe origins, insertions, actions, and innervation of muscles. The only problem is that they don't include blood supplies, but that's easy to write in. This is a great resource! I can throw them in my purse and study anytime I have a few extra minutes (yeah, I know, pretty dorky, but helpful)."
3,It's ok,"so, after all the reviews i thought this would be my best option. However, i find it quite mediocre. The illustrations are beautiful and the information is good, however the cards don't quite put it all together. I can't see how muscles work together as whole and how they influence each other. Especially muscles which are going over major joints, like the hips and the elbows. I was hoping for a resource where I could see exactly how muscles would interact with each other.my advice, think about you really want from an anatomy resource and then go from there"
2,Anatomy cards,I didn't think this set was very informative. I got them when I was studying for my CNOR and really didn't use them. An Anatomy book was more helpful for surgery.
4,Sad Story of Child Soldiers,"This is a powerful film, shot mostly with handheld cameras. It can be faulted for less than sterling sound quality and camera work. Still, the subject matter is so powerful and so important that the content of the film lifts it above its technical production quality. Although filmed in 1998, the sad story of child soldiers in Uganda continues today with the same key players still pretending they seriously want to end the confict into which these children are drawn. The story in Uganda is a tragic one and if I have a fault with the substance of the story it is the absence of a larger context in which the viewer is made aware that Uganda is just one of many countries where the practice takes place. Those looking for that larger perspective will find P.W. Singer's book ""Children At War"" an excellent treatise on the subject."
4,Best brush ever!,I am a groomer and I love this brush. It is the only brush I will buy. My work allows us to order brushes but I prefer to spend my own money and get the MF brush. It gets the knots/tangles out but gently. It is ergonomical as well. The only probelm is the handle of the brush can eventually break from being dropped repeatedly.
5,Works well.,Does what it's supposed too. The two settings need improvement. Suggest buying a lamp dimmer to go along with it.
1,Did I get factory reject?,"When I received this and opened the oversized shipping box, the box that the unit came in had one side open. The plastic seemed as though it had been opened and then put back on, and the cord was not tied like something one would see in a new unit. The unit itself did not looked use, so I am going to try it, but otherwise I feel like I received maybe what was a defective unit sent back for repair which is now being passed on to me. Dissapointed."
5,Made our lives much easier!,"I bought this for my fiance and I'm very happy I did. I will shamelessly admit that this has made me very lazy but it's okay because now I have a lot more energy. it's stronger than anythign else we've tried and it's very comfortable to hold. it's got a solid grip and surprisingly, isn't very heavy. we never use the high setting tho. the low is just fine."
4,Too powerful,This works great on sore muscles and aches. Not to mention tickling your fancy. Only problem is that it can be too much stimulation for sensitive parts. But overall this has given me the most intense climaxes of my life. I highly recommend buying a lamp dimmer outlet that will allow you to control the intensity.
5,Awesome,"This was amazing. Worth every penny that I spent on it. I recommend this for anyone that needs a little more ""attention"" and relaxation!!"
5,Power is pleasure,This can be used for somany things and makes you fel great while using it. Two settings makes life good.
5,Works great!,"Product works great! It has definitely worked as designed. No problems with the massager, takes out the kinks in back and neck."
5,Owned this product for over 10 years,"I've owned this for over 10 years and still works like brand new! It is used almost daily on many different muscles (neck, shoulders, temple, and you know the other)! Very powerful! 100% recommend. It has way outlasted the rabbit which died in a matter of months and cost twice as much."
3,"Good, doesn't quite live up to the hype","The magic wand, while very nice, doesn't really live up to the hype. I'd prefer the head of the wand to be hard plastic, not the soft material that dulls the vibrations. I've spent less money than this and had better results with other products. The benefit of buying the magic wand, though, is that you don't have to worry about it running out of charge because it plugs into the wall."
4,HELPS AVOID BEDSORES,I sit all day long because currently i am unable to walk. This massage wand is able to provide some relief if i sit on it sometimes through the day. i know that bedsores are caused by the blood not moving through your tissues. This device helps the blood move some and provides a little instant relief while doing so. This is the most rugged device i have found for this purpose in my research. In the past year I have purchased 3 of them. It really helps and I'm writing this review at the outside chance someone else has the same application.
1,Not as good as our original one,"We purchased this same brand 4 years ago and really liked it. This one is the same thing but does not have the power it used to. Wanted to send it back but can't. Keep your money, if you are wanting something like the original magic wands this is not it. They don't make them like they used to. It's all talk and no action."
5,Great Massager!,"Very powerful, use with caution but you'll have the best results EVERYTIME!!! Love this new massager, easy to pack and travel with too!"
5,excellent product,"I bought this for my mom who is very old and doesn't go to massage spas or anything like that. So this product was perfect for her needs. She uses it for her sore muscles and body aches. She is very happy with it. I also tried it and it seems to work very well not to mention, the product is very sturdy material. It will last for a long time."
2,"Hmm, minor hiccup here","I love my hitachi and I am now on my second one, since we wore out the first. These attachments were wonderful at first, but actually broke during our first usage. The screws that old the attachments in place pulled through the plastic base. We will likely be able to put it back together, but it is not as ""sturdy"" as one might think."
1,Dont buy!,You can not return this item if you are not happy with it. The vibration is very low and actually made my skin numb and itchy. Looking at advertisements and based on reviews I thought this would be and excellent product and was so excited to get it...but I ended up being HUGELY disappointed. It is not worth the money and I would not recommend this product to anyone!
2,"Item was whole, but did not operate.","I received the product quickly, which was a huge plus.I excitedly tested it out, but found that it did not work.After several mishaps in trying to fix it, I gave up after I realized that several components of the circuit board were broken or defective. One capacitor was completely melted.I understand that I've likely voided any and all warranty/guarantee by disassembling it and soldering its components back together after inspecting them but it still hurts that I paid a lot for this device to have it not work upon arrival."
2,Magic? Not so much.,"The Magic Wand was recommended by a OBGYN, he said everybody has one. We odered it, got it, and laughed. There is nothing about this massager that is even remotely erotic. I'm sure it can work for the massaging it was designed for, but as a bedroom toy, it's way to heavy and bulky. We'll keep it, because we can use for neck massages."
5,Vibe-a-licious!,"No, this won't be a video review! Ha! I don't think amazon would post that, right? well, this is an awesome vibrator -- strong and fantastic, and it plugs in, so you'll never have to go running for batteries while working on your 13th consecutive O. It's got 2 speeds, both very powerful, just at different frequencies. I HIGHLY recommend it. An excellent birthday or Kwanzaa gift for that special lady in your life. Might work on your rim, too, for that special guy in your life."
5,buy this now!,"No matter what, you'll get a lot of use out of the wand. It works wonders on sore shoulders and backs, and it's rather effective (albeit PAINFUL) at getting rid of bruises. And, of course, in the bedroom, there's nothing like it. Team it with Danni`s E-glass G Spot Lover for an experience that quite possibly transcends reality. It is a bit loud, so if you have a roommate or live in a building with thin walls, be wary or lose your inhibitions."
4,Tried and true,This product has been around for over 20 years for good reason. Powerful product and well worth the money. No complaints.
4,Great Vib,"I got this a few months back, quickly delivered. Came in perfact condition brand-new, and the shipping was extremly swift, only a few days wait, and I didn't even expedite the order.Although it only has two setting, the first one is so powerful that you probably will never use the second. I like the rubber head and the style of the wand, but it would have been nice if it was a latex of some kind. Also, I got this thing wet slightly already, dropped it in some water, but luckly it still works, so it's nice to know it's got some qaulity to the hardware.This was my first order for a vib, but it's just a fantastic purchase. I would recommand this to anyone, who has no experiance with wands, great for noobies."
1,NOT A REAL HITACHI,"I bought this item from Amazon a few months ago and after it died in an unfortunate accident, I bought a new one from InfernalRestraints.com, a site run by the Kink.com network.My new Hitachi arrived today, and it is NOTHING like my old one from Amazon! The packaging is a little different, the massager looks a little different, and as far as results--let me just say, the old one worked, but the new one WORKS WONDERS! It feels so much better, especially on the high setting. The high setting on Amazon's vibrator was just this teeth-rattling, annoying buzz. The high setting on my new one is this very smooth but intense hum, like the engine of a high-end sports car.Healthy and Active was selling these on Amazon when I bought mine. I have no clue who Vibratex is, but my suggestion would be, if you're going to pay this much for a vibrator, pay the extra 10, 15 bucks and get the real thing. It makes a difference![...]"
3,Not a Hitachi,"I just received this in the mail and I don't believe it is a authentic Hitachi. No where on the packaging does it state where it is from or who manufactures it and the switch is not a rocker. It's all the way one way off and then low, high. It seems to work but I have nothing to compare it to. I will provide feedback if it fails to be durable. Not sure how to rate yet."
1,Piece Of Junk !!!!,"I've had around 4 of theses Hitachi Magic Wands over the years ! The 2 I purchased around five years ago lasted a long time !But the last 2 I've only had around 8 months,the first one's gears went bad after only using for about 4 months and the second one's gears went bad around 4 months after that !All you hear now is grinding gears,and the vibration is gone !This is ridiculous ! It appears Hitachi has done a ""bate and switch"" on us !!!!Same model but with inferior parts !What a RIP OFF !!!! Please don't support companies that do things like this !They now want $54 for this piece of junk, they are barely worth 54 cents, OK maybe they are worth 54 cent if you buy like 10 of them,so as they wear out very quickly, you will have plenty of spears ! Believe me you will need them !"
1,"REALLY intense vibes; NO low settings. ONLY good for NON-romantic use. Also, CAN'T RETURN.","LIKED:- Materials used- Durable designDISLIKED:- Extremely intense vibrator with NO lower settings, so it's only good for non-romantic use- I don't even have the OPTION of returning this item even though we never used it after seeing it doesn't have lower settings"
2,Broke in 2 days...,"Hello I bought this Hitachi set not long ago, however on the second use the screw came un-done easily and there was no way i could stick it back, because it would keep popping out. Quality wise it was not at all the best-well because it broke so easily. And now I have to buy another set. Thank youuuu :)"
3,So-So,"Bought this wand to use to enhance sexual pleasure, but was awkward had a larger head than expected. The cord was an added obsticle. Do not use anymore, may be good for backrubs, tho."
2,weak retreat,"Sorry, but not the massager I thought it was going to be. This is only my second one in 20 years and maybe I'm just a one massager girl. Seems weak. It is comfortable to hold but not to love."
1,Terrible!!,"I bought this and the only thing I can say positive about itis that it is powerful, if it hadn't broken the third time I used it. The seal of the head part broke away from the rest of it and it just wobbles and heats up. I spent too much money for this! I had a cheaper one i'd bought from a department store ( a different brand) that lasted for many years. It broke just after the deadline to send it back to Amazon. I won't buy another one."
5,i am a guy,i dont think women should have all the fun so i got this for both purposes as a sex toy and a massager i climaxed the most intense climax ever in my life with this wand now i know why you women like it so much and why its so intense to you in your vaginal region because this thing is intense
1,Disappointing. A huge let down,"Was expecting great things with this particular model, but was sorely (no pun intended) let down. A cordless unit that we've had for 2+ years from Sharper Image is more powerful, feels better and doesn't make as much of a racket. Avoid this one. The reviews are overblown. I wish this was something I could get money back on because it's truly horrid."
1,NOT pleasurable!,"This thing is VERY large and heavy, VERY loud, and produces VERY strong vibrations. I guess I didn't really pay attention to the dimensions when I read the product description, but this ""Magic Wand"" is like a small kitchen appliance (think immersion blender)....not sexy at all, and **way** unwieldy. I can only think that all the positive reviews are from folks who haven't used a ""massager"" that is designed for intimate use... Sure wish I could return it, because this was a waste of money."
3,Hitachi Magic Wand Massager,it served it's purpose this product would have been better if it had a long cord. i would not buy this product again..
5,feeling good,This product has a nice head shape that provides a sensual touch when massaging. The versatility and flexibility of the product has allowed me to get into my lower back of my shoulders and maximize the pleasure and free me from muscle tensions. I strongly recommend it and experience the massage to feel rejuvinated. Enjoy
5,Best Purchase Ever,Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas. Message to all fellow men: BUY THIS ASAP!
5,Fantabulous,It's a very good massager. Gets me off every single time. Just wish it could be cordless or lighter. So I can take it anywhere I go.
5,Super,"Just a note to all..guys and gals that this Hitachi is the best thing invented! Your body will love you for it !! Works great for the whole body, muscles, etc. Great for helping one loosen up before exercise and after exercise. Perfect for the private and sensitive spots as well !! You don't have to worry about batteries...just plug it in and it keep the perfect power for as long as you want. I don't think it's that loud, like some have said before me. Just hums right along."
5,"A classic, well worth it.","In a word: Intense.Anything further I can say about this product is too personal, even for a review of a ""personal massager"". But let me say this: buy it and you won't be sorry. In fact, you probably won't be feeling anything but happy for quite a while."
5,You've gotta try this!,"Wife tried it out, and fell in love with it. That said, anyone gotta a place for me to live now. Looks like she dosn't need me hanging around."
5,Best I've ever had,"I've tried every kind of toy I could get my hands on, but this one is by far the best.I bought my first magic wand for about $70, and it was well worth it at that price. It survived two or three years of almost daily use before quietly stopping one day.I also like that I don't have to worry about keeping it somewhere it won't be unintentionally discovered.The only people I wouldn't suggest this to are those who don't want a toy that needs to be plugged in, prefer something waterproof, or like light or very adjustable stimulation (there are only two settings on this, and both are intense). Also, the extensions made for this really did nothing for me. They're made of a weird, almost sticky feeling rubber, and not firm enough to be satisfying. You're much better off just using another toy with it.It's great for a sore neck, too."
5,Absolutely incredible!,"The Hitachi Magic Wand model #HV-250-R is an incredible massager, a two speed power boat motor with a power cord to fabulously relax your tired aching muscles totally! Kudos Hitachi, and thank you for bring back an all time favorite, you've done it again! Magnificent..."
5,"Powerful, pleasurable vibrations","Powerful, pleasurable vibrations. I don't doubt it has been popular for 30 years. It looks conservative, you don't have to worry about leaving it in plain sight, and it makes our bedroom activities much more productive! Although most people probably use it for sexual stimulation, it also does work wonders for sore muscles or an achy back. We try to keep ourselves in shape and are big yoga believers... with the right inspiration, it all goes together!Intimate Yoga For Couples with 270 Color Photos & Free DVD"
5,Just what I always wanted,"I love that this plugs in, so no worries about battery strength, or using up tons of them. The rubber is comfortable, the two speeds are awesome. If you're looking for something stronger this is great, and the lower setting works just as well.It also soothes sore back muscles and knots!"
5,INTENSE,"I love it! It is larger than what would be ideal HOWEVER it makes up for it with performance. I have not ordered any attachments yet. Let's just say it works really fast by itself and I am not sure I would get my money out of ""extras"". I would imagine it works fine for sore muscles too. 8)"
3,magic wand,its very stronge.It would be nice if the cord was longer.i do feel like this massager is made to last longer than most at this price range.
2,"Defective Product, Full Refund and Re-order","I bought this product after much research and indecision. I finally decided to take the plunge a couple of days ago. It was delivered to my business address and waited breathless for close of business and a chance to enjoy a slow and nice ""massage"".However, immediately I plugged it in, all I heard was a slow humming sound and definitely NO VIBRATION.I am bitterly disappointed. I didnt even get to try out the attachments. Unfortunately the product is not eligible for a return but I""d better be getting a refund. Still waiting for my ""massage"".UPDATEGot a full refund from Amazon for this product. I'm hoping I was just unlucky and will re-order same product. Giving this product a two star based on excellent Amazon Customer Service and will do a proper product review once I get an operational ""equipment"".I want to know what all the fuss is all about."
1,Noisy,Why the heck is mine so freakin loud? I understand it's not suppose to be silent but WOW... it rattles and makes odd sounds. It only gets louder the longer it is on. Defective? No return. What do I do? This is not relaxing at all. As a matter of fact the whole house can hear it. HELP???
5,Excellent Product for your tired muscles,I use this massager for my aching back and leg muscles...what relief this gives me. The two speeds are so adequate and the design in reaching those particular spots are great.
3,Yikes,"I was excited about this vibrator, but it is SO strong and pretty loud. I attack my boyfriend with it as a joke because the vibrations are so intense that it's comical. I'm sure it's a great product but make certain that you want extreme vibrations. The low setting is ridiculous and high setting was body-numbing. Yikes. It goes back in the box until I an afford an adapter to lower the vibrations."
1,VERY disappointed!,"The Hitachi Magic Wand Massager is advertised as having 2 speeds. The massager I received has one speed even though there is a choice of high and low on the handle. Whether I choose high or low, the speed is the same. Possibly, I have a dud. I am not going to risk my money on another one."
3,Hitachi massager,"Item fits into the small of your back and works OK. Only problem, item struggles when you apply too much pressure."
1,"Itchy, Itchy, Itchy","I bought this because it had so many reviews. I thought I couldn't go wrong with this, but it just made me itch. I so wanted to enjoy this. If you want something like a jack hammer, this is for you."
2,It looked slightly used--gross!,"This is not an item you want to buy used, so I obviously didn't do that. But there were mysterious scratches on it and it looked a little worn. Thus, I have not tried it yet, although I wish it didn't look used b/c I'm sure it would be helpful otherwise. I have just been too busy to return it."
2,Hand-held massager,I was disapointed in this massager. It lacks enough power to really be felt at all. It did not relieve the sore muscles.
3,"good, but too strong","We got this for my wife. Weve had it 2 weeks, she used it once, then went shopping for something else. The quality of the product is excellent, it's just too strong for her taste. We also got an attachment we will try to see if that might help. Who knew jackhammers could be used in the home?"
1,NOT A REAL HITACHI,"I've owned a hitachi before, it's amazing because it's powerful.This thing isn't a real Hitachi, didn't come in a hitachi box, doesn't look anything like one and is about half the power. A cheap knock off - nothing more.I noticed another reviewer mention a similiar issue, but since they were the only one, I wrote it off. Sadly, I am now the proud owner of a plastic piece of crap.Since it came from China, the return shipping would cost more than the item itself. Buy from someone else - this seller is a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Immitation by ""Vibratex""","This is not a Hitachi. It's about half the weight (333 grams instead of 615) and the high setting uses less than half the power (6 watts for the imitation compared to 14 watts for a real Hitachi). Based on what I read in another review, it probably burns out quickly. A real Hitachi lasts a long time and works well for massaging a body."
5,OMG why did i wait so long,my boyfriend and i have this unbelievable bond and have the most incredible relationship. this product took us to a place you only read about in penthouse forum that you think people are always making up. the orgasms are so intense you almost pass out. this has taken our relationship to a place that is epic legit and almost leaves me in a coma when we are done. one time i almost ended up in traction it was so intense. i could not endorse a product with any more vigor than this one.
5,Amazing Device that YOU NEED,"I am a 43 year old woman, happily married. I discovered this vibrator in my youth and have gone through 3 of these in the last 25 years (heavy use).Nothing like it. Tried other types, but keep coming back for more. It's amazing.It is loud, so not good if you have limited privacy. I could not use it in my college dorm room. That was a very tough year.Enjoy!"
5,Bought 32 years ago,"I have had 5 rear-end collisions/whiplashes, with the resultant series of back problems. I bought this Hibachi vibrator and used it quite a bit. Having good chiropractic care, I don't have to use it constantly any more, so it has sat in my closet. Recently I began having a problem called peripheral neuropathy. My chiropractor suggested I could use a vibrator to keep the blood circulation in my feet, so I dug out my vibrator. It still works as good as new, and, with the aid of Methylcobalamin lozenges, I no longer feel any of the neuropathy in my left foot, and only about 1/3 as much as before in the right foot. I use the vibrator on both feet for about a total of 5 minutes every night, and I am SO thankful for a vibrator as good as this."
3,I've had better...,"This thing is frustrating... Yes, it is strong and for some that will be good. For me even the low setting is too much. Not to mention that this thing is loud... I mean LOUD! It is by far the loudest vibrator I have ever owned. It is louder than the box fan next to my bed. The worst part about this thing is it is huge and fairly heavy. It is hard to maneuver making it not much fun to use. The cord could also be longer too... So I don't know... I've had this thing for a few weeks now, and I'm just not that impressed. The only reason it gets 3 stars is that I know a lot of people like a lot of power in their vibe, and this one has that."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"Within the past few years, three friends recommended this to me b/c I'm always looking for something more powerful than what I've got. I finally decided to pay a little extra for something that was supposed to be AMAZING! I saw how many 5-star reviews it got on Amazon, and I thought I couldn't go wrong. Wrong. I bought it almost 10 months ago, but found that it was numbing me b/c it was so powerful, so I stashed it away after a couple uses and went back to other toys. I decided to give it another go a couple months ago, and it didn't take too long 'til I figured out how to make it work for me. I enjoyed it, except that it would get hot. Eventually, it started to get really hot after just a few minutes of use. Yesterday, I turned it on after using it the day before, and it makes noise, but it doesn't vibrate. It's not worth it, and I'm not going to recommend it to anyone."
5,Amazing!!!,"This is the greatest thing, it makes my girlfriend cuming and cumimng and cuming!Her girlfiedns borrow it all the time, I bought it without a problem in Kiev (Ukraine) on [...] on New Year's Eve, and here is a bunch of attachments) It is better not to use very often, because she gets used heavily to this vibration, and for the love of the game is very suitable"
1,Piece of Junk!,"This item broke after about 20 uses,but never worked good..If your wanting something for sore muscles, this isn't the one to buy!"
3,Get the job done :-),It is a little noiser and bulkier than my other toys however it does get the job done and I do like it.
5,Welcome to the big O show!,Just like alot of other women out there I had never had an orgasm although I enjoyed the intimacy of sex or masturbating I was lacking that final explosion. Well ladies and gentlemen at the age of 32 and with the help of my Hitachi Magic Wand I finally joined the BIG O SHOW! However there is one small draw back... it's addicting!! Not only do I love it but so does hubby... it's certainly brought back the passion and playfulness to our 21 year marriage!
1,Great at first but cord will fail,"I have used this massager extensively, and while it is high powered and works well the plastic around the cord always seems to break down, exposing the wires, which either leads to a blown circuit or small shocks to the skin. I have bought this product three times and have just thrown away the third after it smoked and shocked me rather intensely despite my use of electrical tape."
5,great for muscles,"I first used this in a rehab unit for muscle pain. It works well especially on low. It isn't too heavy which helps for weak grip. I also found it most relaxing when used on the scalp, sinuses, and forehead."
5,This is the best personal massager on the market,"I had high expectations when I bought this massager for myself. I can say with no hesitation that the Hitachi Magic Wand exceeded my expectations. Time after time, this thing really delivers. In fact, I can use it three or four times in a row in times of need and it will still rock my world!I recommend using this with KY Warming Sensation Lubricant. Also, sometimes I use a handtowel over my skin (because the vibrations are really intense) to make clean up really easy.:) Definitely buy one... I know that when the motor finally gives up on this that I will buy another one, no doubt about it. Hitachi makes a GREAT product."
3,JB,"I have to say this was a replacement and this one that I received this time has problems with sounding like an air plane taking off. It not quiet at all and my last one was. So, I am very disappointed by this."
4,Almost too powerful,"Girlfriend really loves it as both a massager and more. She does complain that it can get too intense if the unit is not moved from one location to another frequently enough.Otherwise, great! Will be purchasing some attachments for it soon I hope!"
1,garbage,This broke in 3 weeks. The motor runs but it doesn't vibrate. It was used as a body massager. I followed all the instructions on its use. If you purchase this please keep all the packaging and receipts so you can mail it back when it breaks.
3,magic wand,This is a very powerful vibrator. It is excellent for the typical muscle relaxation but may be too much for delicate areas. Applying it through clothing helps.
5,i use this for other reasons,the reason i brought the magic wand was because my boy friend told me how much power it has. since we live in diferent states we do a lot of self loving to ourselves an he said i would have TONS of FUN using this massager well guess what NO COMPLAINTS WHAT SO EVER .Thanks Baby;)
5,Clunky but effective,"On the positive side, this is an incredibly effective tool - as other reviewers have attested, it will get you there, guaranteed. For my it's usually 5 minutes tops. Amazing.However, it's frustrating that it's not more convenient in terms of design. It's big and clunky, and requires to be plugged in to an outlet. As a result, it can only be used in certain places in the home (near an outlet), it's bulky and not convenient for travel (although much needed for those long nights on the road), and it is quite large in size similar to a big microphone (so it doesn't hide very well in your bedside drawer!)I took one look at this and balked at the size/visual appearance and wanted to return it. My husband coaxed me to just try it once... so I did... and it was instantly my best friend (despite being an ugly, clunky best friend). So despite its visual flaws I would highly recommend it - it gets the job done!"
1,Dissapointed,Very dissapointed. Same model # as the one we have but half the weight and intensity. To bad you cant return an Item like this. The old one still works better than this one.
3,Wand,My Wife likes it. It is good for massaging and anything your imagination can think of. I like it for back massages.
3,Heavy and Loud,The wand arrived and was operative for about 3 days when it simply stopped working. The second one I purchased lasted longer but became louder with time. There is a piece on the handle that is poorly constructed toward the top is thin and can be pushed in when the wand is in use. If the user has issues with arthritis this might simply be too heavy a device to use comfortably. The vibrations are extremely powerful on high and the wand can be used as a muscle massager as well as for more intimate purposes. The maximum recommended time for use should not be exceeded due to the wand overheating and ceasing to work.While it does come with a warranty who wants to go through the hassle of boxing it up and sending it to an authorized repair station? The wand is due for an aesthetic makeover looking more like a kitchen appliance than a sexy toy.
5,this makes me want to scream things that i didn't know i could.,"I know that there are a lot of reviews that pretty much sound like mine, but I had to comment. I just got this and all I can say is O M G. I don't have quick easy orgasms... and unfortunately it's basically impossible for me to come through intercourse. I have been reading about this forever, and I have owned many battery operated toys in the past. I finally bought the magic wand and let me just say - those other toys are going in the trash. It's definitely on the loud side, but if you're alone, who cares. The low setting isn't ""low"" by any means. The high setting is incredible. I recommend this for anyone looking for a vibrator - new or experienced.Oh and - it's pretty good on the achey muscles too ;)"
5,Oh. My. Gosh!!!,"Wonderful, intense vibration. Puts me right to sleep after use. And boy do I sleep well!!!! Highly recommended for all women."
5,One critical thing every other review has left out....,"It is every bit as good for your lady as all the other reviews state.....BUT!It is equally as good for the male half too, lube it up and push a good amount of pressure under the head of your man 'wand' and you'll see why i never use my fleshlight! Finally a toy my gf can be jealous about! And i was the one who bought it for her!"
2,not very strong,"I heard great reviews on this massager. My personal opinion is that it is not strong enough for me. I may not be sensitive enough or the massager might be defective, I don't know. I have used a massager from Brookstone that looks similar and loved it. I just ordered it from their website. Has anyone else felt it is not strong enough?"
3,typical electric wand massager,"No better, no worse than any other that I've used. Prefer the ones with no cord, but this works. Now looking for a good cordless."
3,not a body massager,An excellent massager if used only as a very personal intimant feminine massager.This will break if used as a body massager.I have gone through two of these used as a body massager.
2,It kinda makes me itch like crazy,My girl friend bought this cause she loves it. She let me try it but I don't have anything good to say about it. I really love strong vibrating toys and I can usually orgasm within a couple minutes with a strong vibrating toy. But this just doesn't do the trick because it does nothing but make my legs jitter and I constantly have to stop to itch my legs. I don't like how its so heavy and it's awkwardly shaped. I'd rather just use this on my neck.
1,Didn't work.,It would have been helpful to know that this item would not work using a standard plug inverter for Australia.
1,broke,"Good as long as it worked - nice vibes, powerful - BUT died on me 15 days after purchase. If you don' t believe me, well, inside there' s an inner shaft made of metal spring that connects the motor to the metal head of this thing. Way complicated thing inside. I tried to fix it but couldn' t. The metal spring just out of the blue just snaps out of place and no longer the motor causes the head to vibrate. It' s not even worth send back to manufscturer after opening it inside and saw how it worked. It' s a miracle the way it is designed causes the vibrations. It' s not even the least serviceable inside. Just for throwing away as soon as it breaks."
5,Just right,Great for sore backs and necks. Also very good for giving your mate a relaxing massage. Has lots of power.
4,High RPM Vibrations,"Works great for sore muscles, can be too intense for her. If you don't have it, you need it."
5,Totally Awesome!!!,"This book is among the best Sweet Valley Twins I've ever read.It was right of Jess and the others to stand up for what they wanted.It served Bruce,Aaron and the other obnoxious boys right when they had to wear those skirts."
3,Girla Are Just As Good As Boys.,It shows that teamwork is needed in every way to play any sport and also it teaches boys not to have such snotty attitudes.
5,cooking with fire and smoke,"Very well written,,Describes with great detail, the process of how to smoke and cure varoius foods .It is indepth, with very easy to understand , down to earth language.Also includes many great recipies..Recommended highly for the novice person, seeking information about smoking foods,"
3,Not bad.,"This was my first Coffin book. I just found it pretty ordinary and slow.Didn't feel I got to know John Coffin - perhaps I need to start earlier in the series, which I plan to do."
3,Not good for beginners,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. We have now used the filters several times, and I don't feel it has enhanced our viewing experience. We used it on an Orion XT8. Maybe I just don't know what I am doing (a likely option) but I just wasn't impressed."
4,"works great, easy to trim","This is the 2nd of these pads I've purchased and it's great. Inexpensive and easy to trim to fit your rug. The larger ones are a bit difficult to lay out, but otherwise there are no problems with this. They are very thin, so you won't get any extra padding from them."
5,Keeps the rug right where it belongs.,It was too long so I cut it into two pieces and what able to use both of the pieces to stabilize rugs on my hardwood floors. Can't beat that deal.
2,NOT AS EXPECTED,"i HAVE USED GRIP-TYPE RUG PADS OVER MANY YEARS. THIS PARTICULAR ONE DOES NOT HOLD THE GRIP AND IS REALLY NOT ANY BETTER THAN THE WORN ONE I THREW AWAY. I WOULD NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. ALSO, THE 2 X 5 MEASUREMENTS WERE NOT EXACT."
3,"works well but BEWARE, the 6' square is not a square, its' a circle that's for a 6' area (unless they shipped me the wrong part)","I used this to put under my foam squares in my cement basement i use for a work out area and it holds very well. only issue (as mentioned in the description) is that the ""6' square"" size is actually a circle, not a square.I did not use this with a rug so I can't speak to how well it works under a rug or on hardwood. for a painted concrete floor it works well under my workout padded squares (also avail on amazon)"
4,works well,"I use this between my box-spring and mattress to keep the mattress from moving around at night. Before I bought this my mattress would move about six inches in a week (I must move around a lot in my sleep...) Since adding this between my mattress and boxspring I have not had to move my mattress back into place. So I'd say it works pretty well. My only issue with it was there was a pretty strong odor, so I had reservations about having it in my bedroom, so I aired it out for a couple of days before using it."
2,No luck with product,I recently had new carpet installed and so I bought a runner for the hallway. It crept to one side constantly so I purchased this non-slip rug pad. It doesn't help my problem at all. I tried it under 3 different runners so I don't fault the runners. It seems to be well made and well intended...just didn't work for me.
4,Rug Pad,Ok for the price. Easy to cut. Not perfectly rectangle so had to cut in a straight line. Would be nice if it had lines.
2,Rip-off at the price,"This flimsy rug pad was the right size, but was never worth the price (over $25) for a thin piece of rubber matting. I should have gotten a clue when a 6' round pad arrived in an envelope. It does hold the rug in place against the hardwood floor."
1,don't expect miracles,This did little to keep my floor mats in one place. I still have to fix them every day. I think they cut them with an ax - they were so uneven a 2 year old with a toy scissor could have done a better job. I don't recommend these pads.
3,"Basic, decent for cost","There is very little ""stick"" to this pad, but it does provide a bit of anchoring and cushion for a rug. Easy to cut to fit to your rug."
1,Worthless isn't a strong enough word,"I usually only do these reviews when a product makes a strong impact, either positive or negative. In this case, this rug pad made almost no difference with the trouble I was having, where my chair in front of my computer will cause the carpet to bunch up when it rolls over it. Maybe I'm using it for the wrong purpose, but it says no slip, so I thought that meant no slip. My mistake."
1,"Lee Michaels fan , but .","The main issue I have with this CD is the version of "" Heighty hi "" is a short one which ruins the song . I bought this CD just for that piece , very disappointed . If a CD has a neutered version of a classic song at least put the playing time in the advertisement . I can't imagine Michaels allowing that song in particular to be so butchered ."
1,Worse than a blade grinder,"Yeah, it's a bit quieter than most burr grinders, but like other users I'm using it at its ""finest"" grind, and the pieces are random in size, ranging up to an enormous 1/4"". If you looked at the ragged output you wouldn't think of this as a burr grinder. I've cleaned it out and it makes no difference. Avoid unless you need a course grind."
1,Shame on you Capresso,"Dear fellow consumers, please don't be fooled. Conical burr grinders are high performing grinders for true coffee connoisseurs. A burr grinder that is not conical, technically a burr wheel grinder, is an overpriced fake that performs marginally and CLOGS every few grinds! My favorite part is the nice tan I get from the coffee dust from cleaning this thing with compressed air for 50 minutes!"
1,Junk,"We replaced a Cuisinart burr grinder with a faulty switch with this machine. We have had the Capresso for only about six months. It began jamming and failing to complete a grind cycle after two months. This was at middle grind settings. We have diassembled the Capresso numerous times for cleaning but the jamming has progressively become worse. Also, from the beginning it produced excess static which results in a cloud of coffee dust being ejected from the bin when the bin is removed after grinding. The Cuisinart worked much better for years."
2,"Not worth the price, horrible customer service!","We bought this grinder on recommendations of the Capresso brand. Our grinder worked great for the first 9 months we had it and we regularly cleaned it. One day, it completely died. Because we were under the 1 year limited warranty, they sent us a new one, we just had to pay to ship our old one back to them. The ""new"" one worked for a little longer (14 months) and the same problem happened, it just up and died. Customer service was extremely rude and said because we were out of the warranty period, there was nothing they could do. I was told that many people have their grinders for years and never have a problem, but not being one of those people, this tidbit of information did me NO GOOD! Would not recommend this grinder to anyone, will not buy a Capresso grinder again due to lack of quality customer service and failure to stand behind their product."
1,Clean Your Kitchen After Every Use,"While it grinds coffee decently, this is the messiest appliance in history, requiring me to pull out the vacuum every time I use it. Coffee particles literally spray across your counter as the grinder operates. After grinding, removal of the receptacle canister sets off a static explosion where grindings fly to every region of your kitchen. Seriously, it is almost like a bad joke every time I use this thing. Grinds go EVERYWHERE. I got this as a gift and it pains me to think that my friend spent so much on this thing. The company should be ashamed of the design flaws that cause it to operate the way it does. Oh yes, it will grind coffee... but the instant, substantial mess makes this thing unusable."
1,It only looks good,"IT only looks good! this thing has never worked right! On the first grind, the motor sounded like it was going into high gear, had to stand there and adjust the grinder switch so the beans would go into the grind wheel. Then, a couple weeks later, had to stand and hold the the lid as well as turn the grind switch back and forth. after the third week, it stopped working because the shoot clogged. found the little cleaning brush was a joke, I couldn't even get it in to the jamb-packed, clogged shoot. after 20 min of unsuccessful attempt I used my air compressor. Have to unclog it with my air compressor every three weeks. So if you don't mind blowing coffee all over you from you air compressor - buy it."
1,cannot grind espresso to save it's life,"worked great on french press and drip coffee...but where the grind actually counts, on espresso, it sucked."
2,Sad...I returned it immediately,"This grinder is really nice looking and the price was right, so I was looking forward to incorporating it into my life. But it kept turning itself off until my husband figured out that you could stand over it, pushing the cover down to keep it going. It wasn't because we had not put the top on properly--it needed the extra pressure. I don't know if it was a defect in our unit or in the design but I suspect the design.And the grind settings were way off. We had to use the finest setting all the time and even then, the grind was a mix of crumbs and flakes. Sad! You might as well have a $19 blade grinder.After dropping it off at the post office we went to Starbucks and bought their burr grinder for $88. Much as I dislike supporting any chain store, we are relieved to have a grinder that simply works."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This Company has the worst customer service that I have ever encountered. I was astounded at the rudeness of the Reps and the Supervisors. Buyers Beware, if you have a problem, you will be sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Stainless or Straight-Through,"I bought this grinder for my wife who likes extra fine grind and she was tired of holding the button on our current burr grinder and wanted an automatic shutoff. The straight-through sounded good as our current Salton grinder would accumulate grinds on the side shoot and had to be cleaned regularly. Stainless sounded even better.When I received the grinder I looked at the parts and it looked like any other grinder. The stainless part is the BACK COVER and has nothing to do with performance. Then I pulled out the grind container and found that not only is it not straight through but has an extra bent tube that routes the grinds out the side of the grinder and down into the the container. If the direct side outlet clogs, this will clog even more.I never even tried it, but sent it back. Total misrepresentation by Capresso!"
1,really bad grinder,"This is a badly designed machine. It clogs up and there is nothing more fun than spending 30 minutes first thing in the morning struggling to get it unclogged before I can make coffee. The design is such that I end up with coffee all over the place. The grind was uneven and bad. This machine finally stopped working at all, not that I really cared anymore at that point. I threw it away and got my old little grinder back out. Do not buy this - it is trash!"
4,Capresso Grinder,"Had this Capresso Grinder for a few weeks; been using a blade grinder forever and decided to upgrade; very easy to use, just push a button and the coffee is perfectly ground; a little static, but nothing a little tapping won't take care of; will make coarse grounds for french press and fine for espresso; have used all settings and they all work as advertised; very happy with this product so far"
5,wonderful camera!,"This is a great little camera for just about anything. It fits anywhere and takes pretty good pictures. I loved that this camera could go anywhere I noticed a slight problem with the flash also, but it only happened every once in a while and in general didn't affect the quality of my pictures. This is one of the best cameras I've ever had."
5,Hilarious! What an authentic documentary,"This is a great movie! If it weren't for a small snippet about pumpkin ""procreation"" (wrapping the flowers in pantyhose to prevent fertilization), I would show this to my class because we are studying giant pumpkins. I watched it on TV last week and had to own it. My mom watched it with me last night and she just loved it too. It is funny, tender and genuine Americana. You will love it, too!"
4,Great quality and so cute!!,"This little deer came very well packaged and very quickly. I was surprised by its size, quality, and durability. Even the antlers seem like they would withstand a good deal of force. This would make a great addition to any child's animal collection."
2,The AcomData PDVD7 portable DVD player (revisited),"Okay... in a previous review, I gave it a 4 star rating & sung many praises. Well, I guess I spoke too early. Soon after writing the review, a problem showed up. I could watch movies in widescreen mode, but when I changed it to 4:3, there were vertical green lines all over the screen. Tried adjusting all settings, but no change. I could still watch movies in widescreen with no problems, but this unit wasn't worth keeping if it wasn't fully functioning. I tried e-mailing & calling AcomData... talk about customer service, or the lack of that is. And when they finally did respond, via e-mail, they said that they have never had such happen and they couldn't duplicate the problem. Oh well, I returned the unit anyways... I like it for it's tablet style design, size, and feel. Too bad this product has flaws which seem to show up after you've owned it for a while. FYI... this same portable DVD player is also being sold under the name Coby."
3,"Looks nice, however did not work","Thats a beautiful design. I got mine for the thanksgiving. But had to return it because it would work for sometime and then stop. The video was not very smooth either. There were lot of jerks while playing. Images like blasts, fire storm were not very smooth either to watch.Probably, my player was a bad model. I wasnt that lucky.I called customer service, It took them almost 5 days to respond. A product so new, I would expect them to turnaround in one hour....Wish them all the best in the market place.Over all a sleek design...too bad it did not work for me.K"
1,Rebadged RCA failed product,THis was dumped units from RCA after the failed project DRC618N. RCAs latest generation and much better unit DRC620N can be had for under $200. This is a first generation unit at an inflated cost. You be the judge if you should buy it.
2,to big for my bobbins,"I liked the idea to keep the bobbin with the thread, but these were to large for my bobbins, I have a Bernina & Brother & couldn't use them for either one."
2,Really didn't work well,"While a good idea, I had to whittle them down so the bobbin would fit, so hence the two stars."
1,They Changed the Product,"I own a ton of Bobbin Mates but find this latest batch is a different style (same name, same maker, different product). The end where you put the bobbins is much fatter than before and it is impossible to get the bobbins on the pin. I needed them so I have started filing down the pin with a coarse nail file to get it small enough that bobbins fit on it. They really need to go back to the smaller pin and they need to test their new style on several different bobbin types (I use a very common size) to be sure they work correctly."
2,Do not fit into my thread spools or bobbines,I was disappointed when I tried using these as they are too large for both my thread spools and bobbins.
3,Through My Eyes,"This album, Through the Mind's Eyes, is a beautiful album but it has its ups and downs. Carr brings the listeners through a painting that he captivates in an image that is beautiful and mysterious. But his songs have so much potential to me and they could be much better. I think on Fogland, he really takes a step up and improves many steps up. I would recommend Through the Mind's Eye to all listeners but Fogland is more professional and beautiful."
5,~~An Incredible Journey~~,"In ""Through The Mind's Eye"" Richard Carr takes the listener through a full range of personal emotion. The artist composes and performs his own music, and translates his thoughts and life experiences into amazing sound from his keyboard.From the light, carefree ""Northern California Walking Music"" to the deep intensity and uncertainty of a new romance interpreted in ""Heartstrings"", the wistful reflection of ""Winter of my Soul"" to the sweetness of ""Lauren's Lullaby"", the music keeps the listener wondering what surprise is around the next corner. Each piece is a different style from the one before, but pulling them all together are several variations on the title track, resulting in an incredible journey ......."
3,A good concept ruined by errors,"The idea is a good one; teach the user the basics of C++ and object-oriented programming by building a text editor step by step. Unfortunately, there are just far too many errors in the code listings which will become an exercise in frustration for the uninitiated. Is the program not compiling because of my errors or his? Should that line really say what it does in the book, or is it another typo? The text does a decent job of explaining the concepts involved. I did have questions that weren't answered in the book, but there is no way to avoid that -- nobody can anticipate every possible question. I have reached the half-way point of this book, and though I no longer have enough faith in the code as it is being presented to continue, I now feel that I have enough of a grounding in the subject to tackle a more comprehensive (and more accurate) volume. If that is what you are looking for, then I can recommend this book to you."
4,Wonderful selection of great singing.,"Even if you don't like ""Opera Highlights"", you probably will love this. Some great artists recorded at their best. Everyone I play it for, goes out and buys the CD."
3,Dog Bites,Good read. Characters and plot interesting and hold attention. Main character a bit over the top on dog training but has some valid points just too much on his hobby horse evwen for long time dog person.
4,"Short on Theory, Long on Practice","David Goddard provides the reader of the book with a basic introduction to the Qabalah in a way that is oriented to the Western Mystery Tradition. Combining a dash of theory with a heavy dose of practical ""magickal"" application, Goddard introduces the reader to the Qabalah through guided meditation, references to the Tarot, practical exercises and approachable text.His lineage and approach is through the Western Esoteric or Mystery Traditions, so you will get a bit of Freemasonry, a hint of magick, references to chakras and theosophical elements with your Qabalah. So, this isn't hardcore Lurianic Kabbalah - this is Western Mystery Qabalah. As such, Goddard does a pretty fine job of making it accessable to the practitioner looking to understand it better."
3,Different than the Tower,"Whereas the Tower of Alchemy was innovative in revealing the links between Alchemy, Yoga, Dzogchen, the Arthurian Mytheme and self development, the Tree of Sapphires does not do as much for Qabalah. This book is a collection of practices to expand the perspective. It is not enlightening but interactive!"
5,Fits perfect! Easy to install,I was very happy with this purchase for my 2003 Chevy Express 2500 Van. IT was VERY easy to install and fits perfectly. Couldn't ask for more.
4,Hillbilly Comedy Collection,"If you are a country music fan from the early Sixties you will appreciate seeing some of the country music stars performing from that time. The Hillbilly Collection is just a good 'ol time of entertainment. The set includes: Hillbilly's in Las Vegas and Hillbilly's in a Haunted House plus Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren!! The other two features is the first Lil'Abner movie in black & white and Snuffy Smith in the Army which is really very funny, also in black & white. Pure Hillbilly with lots of laughs."
5,A Most Pleasant Surprise,"I was given this book as a gift. Now to tell the truth, I don't do well with water. Even thinking about ships makes me queasy. After reading this book I am absolutely hooked and fascinated. I want more stories. I wish the author to keep telling me tales. If there is still time for you to get this book as a gift for anyone on your list, I highly recommend it. Anyone would enjoy this read. And, if by chance you know someone with a Navy history or who already loves the sea, this book is a must. I surely hope there is a sequel. Thanks to the author for much enjoyment."
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!,This product worked sometimes and stopped working completely after two weeks. It is poorly made and drained batteries. I was totally disappointed.
3,"When it works, it's great.","These have always been a stand-by for us for travel, or for when the Mighty Hitachi won't do (places where a quieter vibe is needed, etc.) but they can be very, very finicky about batteries.This one, for instance, will work with a battery one package of Duracells, but not those from three other packs of Duracells. And mind you, all of these batteries work in anything else we put them in - but only the batteries from one particular package will work with this thing.Annoying, no? And when these run out, how do we know if the next pack of batteries will be palatable to Her Highness the Water Dancer?But other than that, it's a good little vibe if you're looking for a very localized, intense, ""buzzy"" vibration in an ""outie"" toy.For the full-on thrum and hum, there's nothing like the Hitachi Magic Wand.But you knew that."
1,not satisified,I am very upset that I did not receive what I ordered. The product that I did receive wasn't even close. First of all it was pink and not purple. If I order something from THE PURPLE STORE my product should have been purple. What was pictured on the site was a vibrator with the rabbit detached from the controller. What I received was a vibrator with the rabbit attached. Needless to say I wrapped it up and gave it as a bachelorette party gift.
2,Wrapped In Ruffles Panty,"I actually bought these for my sister. She wasn't that happy with them not because they didn't look great, but because they ran a little small to be plus size. She has a rounder bottom and they didn't fit well for her. The plus size and the regular size was just about the same in my opinon...I bought the reg one size fits all for me and when I saw hers you couldn't really tell the difference if it wasn't for the tag. If you have a very round tooshie then these may not be for you...Just keep in mind it is One Size Fits Some."
5,Amazing story,"This story spans the generations from WWII to the modern day. It's scary and believable, a well thought out thriller."
2,It was okay.,"My sister picked up this paperback the other day. She thought that because of the lead, Shep, that I'd like to read it. Well, I read it. It was full of action and had a lot of weapons information, which sort of reminded me of Commando. That was pretty intense. Now the romance side, well, I am a guy, but even I could see that the action between the two protagonists got a litte too mushy a bit too fast, especially considering their past relationship. Sooo, I say it's an okay read, but not one of the best. Sorry sis (she loved it)."
1,Leaked profusely,"Length:: 1:04 MinsI bought this hose hooked it up to three different faucets and it leaked profusely from around the fitting that attaches to the faucet.I returned the hose for and received a replacement and it does the same thing. Another thing that was wrong with both of them was the strain relief spring that is supposed to be attached to the fitting was just sliding back and forth on the hose. My guess is that there were a bad lot of these hoses produced and I was ""lucky"" enough to get two of them. I contacted Gilmour and they said there policy was for me to cut the ends of the hose off and send them back and they would send me a new hose. My comment was I'm not spending my money to send back parts of a brand new hose when I can return it to Amazon for free and buy your competitors product that doesn't leak. It's a shame it looked like a very nice hose and from the reviews I would imagine that ones produced correctly are."
2,Kinky. And not in a good way.,"I know the kink-free hose is a myth, but I expected this ""kink resistant,"" relatively expensive hose to be better than the cheapos I've bought in the past. Instead, it's one of the kinkiest hoses I've ever had. And it's very heavy, which would be acceptable if that kept the kinks out, but it doesn't. Very disappointing."
5,Great hose. Leak free.,"This is a hose so there isn't too much to say about it. It is a bit heavier than my older hose, but then again it is leak free and feels like a high quality hose. It's over-sized end made it easy to screw on to the outside faucet without incident. It is very sturdy and even with a bit of weight on it I didn't find any major interruption in water flow. You get what you pay for so even though this isn't the cheapest hose, I would definitely recommend it to avoid the hassle of leaky hoses later."
5,"Most informative,interesting,humorous book on poet.","First hand account, pictures, letters and poems of poet and his wife make this one of the best on the subject. Warmth, humor and association with press people, military, etc. make the author of ""Trees"" and other works come alive. Apparently, J. Kilmer an early Women's Rights Advocate and ecologist. The author and eldest son of the poet is fair, witty and without the ""sugary"" prose of admiring child. Never before seen NY TIMES articles of the poet, documents, personal letters, pictures and family writings add to the uniqueness. Easy Reading."
3,Early version of a recent work,"This is an early work of the author written as a requirement for a 1983 college course in Creative Writing. While it does contain a good story about a rarely addressed era of history, it was never edited or professionally published. I would only buy it after reading G.G. Stokes, Jr.'s Colonial Southeast Series. That said, if you like colonial stories, and if you can find one of the only ten or fifteen copies of this work floating around the marketplace, you'll enjoy the book. Compare it to The Road to Bloody Marsh, the rewritten, edited, and professionally published version of this story that came out in August 2009. Warning! You'll see enough similarities between these two works to recognize them as kin folk, but, like twins, they both have their own unique personalities and stories.The Road to Bloody Marsh"
3,Liberals v. Conservatives,"I'm a big fan of the Supreme Court; I love reading about the Court, its Justices, and the workings behind the most important Court in the world. True, this book was a rather good book when it came to describing the inner turmoil of the Court, the conservative Chief Justice against the liberal Justice Marshall, Justice Scalia vs. Justice Blackmun. But it seemed as though too much was placed on the fighting, and not enough on his own experience. It seems as though his experience is all turmoil. I doubt that this was the only ""good"" thing that came about the experience. If anyone wants to read a good book that is fantasically written, read ""The Brethren."" If you've already read it, then maybe this book is worth a look/see."
4,No surprise - it's not just a court!,"This book is extremely helpful for someone who wants to understand how the US Supreme Court reaches its decisions. Since it became the final arbiter in (too hot to handle) political questions it was inevitable that it became a political rather than a judicial institution. This is rather perplexing, especially to a European reader where courts a (relatively) non-political. Having read this book one understands the Court and its inner workings, the competing staffs and all that, so much better. So decisions like the one over the Florida vote are no suprise at all!"
4,A nice insider look at the Court.,"Lazarus breaks with tradition at substantial risk to his reputation to divuldge important insights about his time at the Court as a clerk to Justice Blackmun. The stories are well told and understandable, even for a non-lawyer, but the detail and seeming embellishment of some of the accounts leaves one wondering just how genuine Lazarus's insights might be."
2,Where's the substance?,I was really surprised by the tone this book took after the first three chapters. I'm not a lawyer. Therefore I was not captivated by the tedious legalisms that the author got into. It's a shame. The first three chapters were very interesting and informative. I don't understand why Mr. Lazarus turned the theme of the book from his experiences as a clerk into an advocay piece. Too bad it missed the mark.
1,"All hype, no content","It was a good thing I didn't pay for my own copy. I would have felt a fool. This book fails to deliver any substance of the nature or causes of the compromises and/or non-compromises made by the Justices. The only thing this book does well is the one thing that it should not do, and that is to reveal the confidences to which the author was privy. The author seems to have forgotten that he received the confidences in his capacity as a lawyer. It is just as well that the author is now a prosecutor. No private corporation or individual would want to hire a lawyer who divulges information communicated in confidence."
2,Fails to deliver,"Over the course of Lazarus's 500 page tome, I'd guess that, at most, 50 pages are dedicated to the ostensible subject: the behind the scenes workings of the Court. Lazarus describes an extensive Supreme Court history of three divisive issues: capital punishment, race-based remedies, and abortion (the first and last issues covered more completely than race). While he does a fine job with this material, it was not what I expected to find in ""Closed Chambers."" Those looking for the ""inside scoop"" are advised to stick with ""The Brethren,"" a book that actually delivers what was promised."
3,Could use some heavy editing,"Mr. Lazarus' editor clearly did not have the backbone to redact much of the tedium from this book. The text is at its strongest when Lazarus describes what he witnessed during his days as a clerk for Blackmun. In addition, much of his description of the Rehnquist Court helps contribute to his overall thesis, which is that an increasingly fractured Court is detrimental to the health of the judiciary. Although the author clearly falls on the left end of the spectrum, he does a decent job of compensating for this bias by examining issues from many different sides.Unfortunately, much of the text does little to contribute to Lazarus' point. The windy history of capital punishment and the Court could have been told in at least fifty fewer pages; the same is true of the account on the Court and abortion. Wading through this history may be worthwhile for aficionados of Court history (like me) but others will probably find it tedious."
5,Money well spent,Do not just take Irwin Schiff at his word. Go to any large library and refer to the codes that he specifies. One must draw the same conclusions as Irwin. People to lazy to read and ignorant liars will of disagree with the black and white truth. Read and decide for yourself.
5,The Government [and the] Income Tax ... How to fight back,This is the book that the government is trying to ban. It contains the ammo you need to fight back. This revealing book shows you that there is no law that requires you to pay the income tax. I love it!!! Thank you Irwin Schiff!
5,Ignorance Leads To Slavery!,"When people are ignorant, it's easy for the culprits to take control over them, strip them of their rights, control them via fear and may make them say ""thnak you for not hurting me more!"" Mr Irwin Schiff, a tax expert of the first class, through his painfull experience with the Federal Mafia will lead you through the maze of "" tax laws"", prove to any reasonable person (logic...) that America has lost the title ""Land of the free, Home of the brave"". If you want to live as a free person, and you need to know why you are not, this book is a must for you!"
4,Gallileo was put in jail too...so what's the point?,"For anyone wanting to learn more about the way the Gov't illegaly collects the ""income"" tax, and exactly what authority the IRS has or doesn't have, this book is a must read.And to those using the ...well he was put in jail..argument. Stop trying to scare people. Many great men and women throughout history have been jailed by corrupt governments who wanted to shut them up. So what's your point?Read. Learn. Get mad. Then do something to stop the insanity."
4,This book will wake you. A must read,I found this book as a great help with the fight that I'm having with the IRS. It easy to read. you can follow this book step by step. Yet I suggest you read Irwin's other books too
3,Free PDF Download of this book,"Here is a link to download a copy of Irwins book for FREE. The thing that people don't get is that we pay some of the fewest taxes of any country in the world. Look at Europe. My Point is WE HAVE TO PAY SOMETHING. All the ""PAY NO INCOME TAX"" people.....The roads, military, infrastructure and education for your children is NOT FREE so what arrogant sense of FALSE ENTITLEMENT Gives you the right to PLAY GOD....HE SAID TO RENDER UNTO CAESAR WHAT IS CAESARS. Get a Life, quit bitchin and being a victim and spend some time WORKING LIKE THE REST OF US. YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE PARASITES WHO LIVE OFF WELFARE....[...]"
5,Are you willing to lose your citizenship?,There is only one true legal way to not pay income taxes and request a refund of previous years. One must be willing to become a citizen of another country and lose their US Citizen Status.
2,"LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL,EXCEPT IRWIN SHIFF","Another referenced and documented book by Irwin Schiff on our present day government and its ""judiciary"" and the IRS by printing and disecting the actual laws in USC 26 (the internal revenue code). Illustrated with excerpts from his actual trial transcripts. Where Mr. Schiff goes to jail twice. I do not recomend first reading any of his material. Once you have read his books you too can go to jail. These books are full of confusion and delusionary manifestations of a misguided person. You see the revenue law relate to taxpayers not to non-taxlpayers."
5,Wonderful story,This is a really sweet story about a woman who has to choose between love or doing the job she loves. It is a story that everyone should read.
4,"You've Cheered for the Wizard, Now Cheer for the Sorceress","The U.K. may have J.K.Rowling and Harry, but the U.S. have Mark Goodman and Ariana. In this first book, of the 4 part Montgomery Legacy collection, Goodman transports us to Crestine Township, where the sense of forboding is palpable, right down to the creepy mansion on the hill.Goodman's palette of words brings us to our first confrontation with evil with our senses fully activated. Although Ariana, like a young Harry, has just made the decision to use her newfound powers to protect her family and friends from the forces of evil, it's quite clear it's not going to be easy.With well thought out characters and scene descriptions, you feel like your standing with Ariana and her friends as they see, hear, feel, and smell the world of evil their journey has taken them to. It's no surprise that Goodman already has us primed for book two of the Montgomery Legacy!"
3,Burn the Floor: The New Show 'Floor Play'/ Jason Gilkison,"I've watched this DVD once, whereas I've watched the original ""Burn the Floor"" several times. One should not compare, I'm sure - but the second one does suffer by comparison - that is, for my taste. There was no spectacular number in the second one, such as ""Carmen"" in the first one. Soooo, if you haven't seen the first one, you will enjoy this one. Or even if you have. I will watch it again soon."
4,"Great performance, magnificent dancers, great show!","A great show, with magnificent dancers, recommended for those who love dancing, my daughter watched several times, and start dancing too!"
5,Important work,"Fabulous, accessible writing! Deft use of theory makes for sensible critique. A book I go back to time and time again."
4,A feminist reading of seven of Hitchcock's films.,"A fascinating though dense read for people interested in women's studies or Hitchcock. It ain't easy reading, but Modleski's perspectives of some of Hitch's best work (as seen through the lens of feminist criticism) is worth the struggle."
1,Not a good analysis,"This is a horrendous book. The author's feminist agenda completely distorts her interpretation of Hitchcock's films, and the conclusions she comes to are ridiculous.Not recommended."
4,My Fiancee loved them,I gave these to my fiancee for Valentines day this year and she loves them. She may even end up wearing them for the wedding.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This item came in two boxes and 354 pieces. I takes over 8 hours to put together. It is poorly designed, and was missing pieces. When you attach the rear stabalizers, the third and bottom drawers do not have room to close. The middle screw hole of the T-spacers does not fit the screws, and the drawers are difficult to open and close. When you call for assistance/replacement parts, you get a machine asking you to leave a message."
5,Italk is cool,"The italk lets you talk on it, and its cool! i love those features. It can also be a like a mini speaker. It's a great gadget. What would be better is a lapel mike (14.99) it make a great microphone"
2,hallmark trash,"As a longtime collector of Jo Stafford, I am capable of identifying a poor cash-in ""effort"". Hallmark's record in bringing out of print lp's back to the marketplace would be laudable if the transfers had any semblance of real quality to them. This is one of the worst ever. One listen to the 1st track will prove that. Between her ""Broadway Revisited"" album, and ""Portrait"" 3 cd set, you can get almost all of these in far better fidelity.There is even a better sounding rip of this on youtube for free. Jo deserves FAR better than this."
5,Russian soul,I have been looking for this recording after wearing out a tape that I had and played constantly while driving. What impressed me about this oft recorded piece was the marriage of a Russian conductor and a Russian pianist; the brilliance and the pathos and the soul of this piano concerto were brought to life by these Russian artists interpreting a most Russian composer. I am looking forward to hearing this incredible recording again...and again...and again.
1,Save some money,Low quality plastic and quite useless. The wand in the other hand is sublime. This is just a silly piece of plastic.
4,Does what its supposed to,If you're buying this then you know what it's for and it works well. I'd recommend it. Get one today!
4,A pretty good electroclash album - has three great songs on it - you'll probably like it. - 4.5 stars,"The Cyanide Valentine's ""Let It Rot"" is a pretty good album with three great electroclash songs on it. The rest are good too, but these are obvious standouts. These songs are - ""Natural Born Liar"", ""You Don't Really Love Me"" and ""You Are The Focus"" (and possibly ""Freaks"" and ""Desipicable Whore""). I don't know who the singer is, but he definitely fits the style well. I suppose a good way to describe it is that it's rough but sounds like it's electronic at the same time. The musicianship is basically garage rock with some electronic bits thrown in, and the instrumentation is pretty good. The production could use a bit of work, though. Overall I think a lot of people would like it, but it's mainly for genre fans. Recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"
2,Overrated,"This is the first GPS system that I have used and I can only find 2 positives about it. The price is right and it is fast to recalculate a new route when you take a different turn.However, the database must be old as a 2 year old entrance on the Ohio turnpike is not recognized. It also failed to pick up US30 between Mansfield and Bucyrus whcih has been constructed for at least 4 years. It will also not recognize certain streets if you don't call them the same as they are labelled in the system. A case in point was using a postal address the NV-U70 couldn't find it, but when I arrived it had it shown as a county road #!Don't leave home without having a very good idea of the route you are taking. I use Microsoft Streets and Maps which is far more accurate than the NV-U70.I regret my purchase and am considering a Garmin product, which effectively says the price is not really right.ACAmherst, OH"
2,don't waste your money,"I am very disappointed with my unit, you can't get any software to update the unit. it tells you to go to the sony website and it's not even available. I took this unit on my trip to Vegas and programmed my hotel into the unit,the unit told me that I reached my destination, I was no where near my hotel, I was more than a mile from my hotel. I going to buy a Magellan"
1,Do not buy it,"I just bought one last week. Over the weekend I tried it from Middletown,NJ to Philadelphia Zoo. I expected it should guide me to Zoo using Major Highway. Instand, it guided me to destination through center of Philadelphia city(I do set option using interstate high way option). When I came back from Zoo, it guided me a very strange route to home. Although I did not get lost, I looked the map, it went with a traingle to bright me back.At that night, I read the manual again. I tried the route plan option. It can not show what route it is supposed to go. You can not review the route plan. I think any one can grap a map and points the much better route than this navigator. So, If you want to buy this navigator, I do not know it can really help you."
4,Noir kicks butt,Great Amine at it's best. When I first saw this movie I knew I had to have it. It's like Mezzo but deadlier.
4,Solid Anime,"I just finished watching this series. I found it to initially be slow moving, and the hidden parts of the tale started really becoming clear towards the later half episodes. I disagree with the Amazon.Com review stating that the 'amnesiac' characters weren't all that interesting. In fact, I very much came to like the protagonists, despite the somewhat played-out theme of killer without memory. And I found them interesting, their tales gripping, and the dialogue well thought out (there is not a large amount of dialogue in this series, but what is spoken is not wasted). Chemistry between them seemed real as the series played out. If anything surprised me the most, it was the bloodless nature of the extreme violence from a graphic viewpoint. The music, outstanding. I've put all three soundtracks on my IPOD.I plan on watching the entire series again very soon, at least one more time."
3,Eh,"Noir isn't great, nor is it really that bad. It's just: Eh. I've tried to get into it, but it's just not pulling me in. I've watched 2 of the 7 disks and I've come to the conclusion that there's a lot better anime out there that I should watch before finishing this series.The story isn't very compelling. The art isn't that great. There's no amazing movement that makes up for the so-so art in many anime series. The music is pretty good, and it certainly makes up for some the poor animation during the action sequences.My suggestion is to not watch this unless you've seen all of the good anime series and you're bored and now working through the the second tier series."
3,Shoot 'Em Up,"This is something of a strange anime. On the one hand it is a constant cold blooded murder theme and for that reason alone should not be allowed in the hands of young children or teenagers. There are more people killed per minute than in many video games.Buried deeply in there somewhere was a philosophical question - Can evil beget good? That's hardly a question to pose to the ordinary anime crowd. What's more it smacks of a phoney plant to give the anime some ""production value"" while being marketable to impressionable young people.The quality of the production is first rate. The animation is pretty good. But I'm growing weary of ""beautiful girl heros"" and this is likely to burn out anime if anything does."
1,Avoid this girly anime ... RETCH BARF !,"I got this based on a referral.I'm used to Appleseed, GOTS, Vexille, Afro Samaurai.I didn't even watch one whole scene.The animation was lame, the story more so.2 buns down ...My toilet is more interesting.:("
1,Needless re-release,"I was extremely dissapointed in the fact that ADV films decided to re-release the series in a new ""complete collection"" in a box. What about the rest of the fans who actually bought the original releases? The people who, because of their support, made the series successful. Have some damn respect, ADV. Shame on you. But all this is expected as they like to include a ""clean opening and ""clean closing"" in EVERY volume of every series they release and call it an ""extra feature"" and also include as little as 3 episodes in a disc and sell it at regular price--Noir is no exception. Pioneer, FUNimation, etc. sometimes include upwards of 5 episodes in every single disc of a particular series, but never 3, that's absurd!This edition was completely unnecessary--just another attempt by the infamoous ADV films to make a few bucks. For that reason THIS particular re-release gets zero stars and the original 5 stars."
2,Good til it broke,"Has easy to use volume & song selection controls which makes it great to use while jogging. Drag & drog song transfer is easy but annoying not to be able to have playlists & needing to name songs in the order you want to play them (ie, alphabetically). Nevertheless was great and lightweight. But just died on me after about 6 months. Have taken apart and all the connection look ok so must be the software. Unfortunely, another MP3 player for the landfill."
2,great but stupid head phones,"i am tired of this garbage. i had 4 of these things already 4 different new ones from j and r , i bought first one from j and r from amazon BRAND NEW and it worked for 1 week then headphone jack started to screw. then i bought another one and the same thing happened then i went to jandr bought a new one returned old one so i didnt have to pay for third one and SAME THING! and 4th one same thing so i just threw it away and said forget it im gonna try to RHOMBA cuz my friends used it for a year and no issues. otherwise this is GREAT great features radio is kinda low on recieving many places u cant recieve a high radio station."
2,Buy Up or Buy a CD Player,"I tried the iPod Shuffle - terrible sound quality and service to match. So I buy the MuVo TX FM. Better sound quality but you can't determine the order of the playlist and the software is awful. Neither the owner's manual nor the website give much guidance on using the software to transfer music. And, matching my experience with Apple on the iPod, the first 3 Tech Support - using that term loosely - people never told me I couldn't determine the playlist order and none of them could walk me through how to get the software to work on my computer running XP. I could have continued to hassle it but life is too short - I went out and purchased a Panasonic Shockwave CD player that plays MP3 files and the sound is shockingly excellent!"
4,"Solid, functional, light, good quality","Great Item. Compact, functional, with radio, light and solid at the same time. Quality/cost ratio higher compared to other mp3 players of the same category. Just one small defect: the AAA battery gets exhausted very fast even if the player is off."
3,okay but outmoded,This is a nice device but it's completely overshadowed by the iPod. One reason is that the iPod holds so much more. Another is that the iPod's battery really lasts a long time whereas with this device the battery has to be frequently changed. A third is the superior interface and controls on the iPod. The original advantage of the MuVo was lost when iPod introduced the solid state Nano.
1,I wish Amazon had negative stars,"A waste of time and money. The player stopped working after less than a month. Creative sent me instructions to download new software, which I did (wasted an afternoon), and it still did not work. I e-mailed them, but with little hope, given the reviews I just saw on Amazon. It seems like they intentionally put defective products on the market with no concern for their reputation, which used to be good and is now going downhill. Do not buy this product. Save yourself a headache. There must be a better use for your money than throwing it down the drain, which is what you'd be doing if you purchased this MP3 player."
2,What you read is not what you get,"from the description:What's in the BoxThis package includes the 512 MB MuVo TX FM digital audio player, earbuds, 15-inch velcro armband, carrying case with beltclip, and CD-ROM with Creative MediaSource music management software. MediaSource is an easy-to-use application for ripping CDs, organizing entire digital music collections, and easily transferring MP3 and WMA files.I got a lanyard - no armband, no carrying case. I need the armband to run!"
4,Nice for the price,"Any kid could figure out how to use this, which dosen't say much for us adults. I did manage after some playing around to see how easy it really is. It will do folders so you can drop whole albums straight from your PC or single songs if you like. It will show up as an external drive even without the software which I have not even loaded. While the WMA files I am using save space even at the highest quality they still sound slightly compressed, this tells me the unit will give you all the detail in the music you need. It seems durable as I have droped it and it still works fine. The battery life is slightly less if you play it at high volume, If you run it into a sound board you will need the extra drive, also if your headphones are less efficent. Overall the best feature is it plugs straight into your USB with no cables. This is a good unit I fit seven complete albums on the 512 I think I need a 1g now. Have fun!Ray"
3,Unimpressed,"I received this mp3 player as a gift, and thankfully I hadn't spent any money on it. I use it when I run, and I love the design, it nicely clips to my belt, and even came with an armband I could clip it to. For some reason, no more than 6 months after I got it, it would randomly turn off, and go through bouts of rebellion where it would work for 5 seconds, then stop, then go again. Very frustrating, indeed. I still use it, because when it decides to work, I'm satisfied with it. I noticed other people have problems with it turning off...has Creative become aware of this?? Also, the headphones are completely unremarkable, and the volume does not go high enough for me! Kind of expensive for being crappy!"
2,Lasted 8 months,"A good product once you figure out how the shuffle key works. Good versitility allowing both MP3 data, Flash drive data and FM sound. Volume seemed low but I tried other headsets and it seemed to work okay.After 8 months of normal use the LCD panel no longer displayed and the buttons did not work. Contacted Creative tech support and they said I should send the unit in. However, I must also send in a $25.00 Non-refundable check to test the unit. If the unit was bad they would replace it but keep my $25.00. The"
3,OK for the 1st month,"I just got the thing a month ago and now one line for the lcd display has died on me. It still plays music, but that one line missing is very annoying."
5,"Sounds Excellent, but not well built","I had gotten this little piece for my dad. He throughly seems to enjoy the quality of sound. Easy to use, easy to add files, just drag n drop. Decent battery life. I noticed that battery cover keeps falling off and he had to tape it into place. I would have loved it if they had incorporated a SD expansion slot."
4,Good product; poor instructions,"It took me a long time to get this device going. Even after downloading the detailed instructions, I found the directions inadequate. An error message I got was not explanatory. I admit I am a novice with MP3 players, but I have used computers in my work for over a decade and I have an advanced degree. Finally, it was a little annoying to see the price had dropped significantly from the time I ordered it until now."
2,Cheap and without even the slightest hint as to how to calibrate it,"I bought this but have absolutely no faith in it. Maybe it is such common knowledge no comment is required, but really one of the virtues of analog hygrometers is that they can be periodically readjusted or calibrated--but not a peep about how to.Looking at the so called screw used for calibration, I'd be afraid to. I'm open minded enough to amend this review should it turn out to be reliable, but for now 2 stars seems generous.Update: Still not sure how reliable it is--but after calibration, not with salt water, but with damp cloth wrapped around the instrument for 30 min, used the screw to set at 99-100%, seems to be tracking reasonably well and agrees with online weather reports +/- 5% when placed outside. So maybe a bit better than I first thought."
1,No quality control,"I just received this item. I was excited about finally being able to measure the humidity in my apt. However, I will be returning this item for the following reasons: 1. It came with NO instructions. 2. The front ""glass"" has imprinted (probably from some very old wrapping) lettering across it, obscuring the needle. 3. It is uncalibrated (it's currently reading 95%, not even close). With no instructions it's basically useless."
2,Low Quality,Mine came with the plastic part of liner that holds the outer glass stuck inside of it. Would not recommend due to quality issues.
4,Good BARGAIN,"This hygrometer is a good bargain.Plus or minus 2% accuracy is, at this price, OKAY with me."
1,Worthless,"The one they sent doesn't look like the picture, they refunded my money and let me keep the hygrometer. The hygrometer they sent me (which looks similar but not the same) isn't accurate at all. I put it in the Boveda Humidipak and it read 53% (should have read 75%). I got another digital hygrometer for about $8 more (with thermometer) and it was within 2%. I'm looking at the accurate one right now and it's reading 59%, this one is reading 21%. It's a complete piece of junk but at least I'm not out any money and have a new magnet."
1,"Bought two, what a disappointment","Bought two to monitor inside and outside a safe. Left both of them side-by-side to see if they would read the same, not. One read 45 the other 70. Don't waste your money."
2,"Not ""Western Digital"" brand","Amazon is seriously going down. This is listed as ""Western Digital"" hygrometer but there is no sign of ""Western Digital"" on the meter or the box (which is just a blank white paper box). This kind of mis-leading labeling is not acceptable to me.I'm very disappointed at Amazon. I've been buying from Amazon since 2001 and Amazon used to be my trusted shopping site. But I don't trust Amazon any more. It's time to say bye-bye."
1,DOA,"Tried the saltwater test, tried wrapping it in a damp towel - the needle never budged. On the plus side you can manually adjust the needle so if you're good at guessing relative humidity then you've got yourself a nice looking, functioning hygrometer."
4,So far so good,"First thing I did was put it in a freezer bag with a cap full of salt with some water to test it. After 8 hours I checked it and it read about 74.5% humidity, so it was pretty accurate right out of the box. I'm using it in my guitar case to keep my guitar from drying out, and so far it's perfect."
5,Great product but vendor...meh,"So this hygro is awesome for the price, calibrated once use the damp towel method and it's worked great ever since. extremely accurate.However, on the other hand, the vendor I purchased it from was located just a simple 6hour drive from my town, and yet the item took something like 17 days to arrive which was a bit offputting to say the very lest."
2,A toy Hygrometer and not even a semi professional.,"This Analog Hygrometer was a part of Frame and hygrometer set and now they sell it as an individual item. No problem so far. But Measuring humidity is other thing, this unit is of 12-14% and it show more humidity than actually is. I measured it with several digital Hygrometer and all of them within 1 to 2% were the same except for this one. You can adjust it a little bit but if it's too much out of range, then you can not even ajust it. Botton line is, if you are picky about exact measurement(or within +- 2% then this is not for you. Yes it show humidity exist but not percisely. For 8 bucks you decide."
1,Wasted money,"I purchased this as my first hygrometer to go in my new humidor. I put it in a plastic bag with a small dish of the moist salt mixture to get the humidity in the bag to 75%. When I put the screwdriver in the back to turn the reading from 60% to 75%, it stopped around 68% and wouldn't adjust any higher. My screwdriver actually bent the flimsy metal a bit before I decided a moment later that this hygrometer is total junk. I wasted my money trying this product because most of the reviews say it's a pretty good hygrometer. Taking the cap off the top and removing the face reminds me of a 6th grade science project on humidity. To replace this one which I got yesterday, I'll go to the cigar shop here in town to get a good hygrometer. Had I found this in a store and picked it up, I would not have bought it because the metal feels like reinforced aluminum foil."
3,Very basic,Just got this today. Didnt realize from the picture how tiny this thing was. Not much bigger than a silver dollar. In order to read this you have to be pretty close. Bought it to use in the basement. Better suited to a humidor. Adding the size of this in the description would have been nice. Not a great bargain IMO.
2,Not very accurate,"I purchased three of these hygrometers to use with three different dehumidifiers in different rooms of my house. Immediately after receiving them, I performed the salt test on each to determine their accuracy. One was spot on, one a little high, and the other a little low. That was a bit discouraging, but since they didn't cost much, I kept didn't return the inaccurate ones. After about a year of use, two of them suddenly became highly dysfunctional, giving wildly inaccurate readings, making them essentially useless.I would not buy this brand of hygrometer again."
2,Faulty products,"I ordered two hygrometers by Western Humidors. The first package was obviously a ""return"" that had been put back into circulation, the mounting device was missing and the plastic shipping bag was torn . The second package was intact with sufficient materials but the glass faceplate was cracked. The only thing that keeps me from a one star rating was the ease of refund by Amazon."
1,Junk,Ordered two to place in guitar cases. One didn't work at all and the other is suspect but seems to be working. At this price its hit or miss.
3,Not very accurate,"It has a nice presentation but I have had a hard time calibrating it, and I am not sure it is precise enough."
2,Not very good.,I have other hygrometers and this one is all over the place. Attempts to calibrate it has not been successful. It seems that it keeps changing even thought the other hygrometers are reading the same at the same location.
3,Not the most accurate out of the box,"This is a nice looking hygrometer, which I bought for monitoring humidity in my basement to minimize operation of my dehumidifier to the required level. Out of the box, it read low. Now, it is an analog gauge, probably made in China, definitely not NIST-traceable like the $195 ones are. But it was bad. I recently calibrated it using the saltwater method, and it was off by over 20%. Another super-cheap, much older holmes plastic meter I put in the bag read exactly perfect.So beware of calibration of this unit. I also get the feeling that the needle sticks sometimes, so watch for that."
3,Lives up and down to expectations,"I bought 6 of these to use in a compost lab with Environmental science students. They disagree by as much as 10%, but do seem to remain consistent. They are working for our purposes, but I certainly wouldn't recommend them to someone who needs a highly accurate, highly precise measurement. I'll be thrilled if they all survive for use again next year."
4,"Analog Hygrometer 2.25"" by Western Humidors",Received item in perfect condition. Shipping time was excellent. After calibrating the unit it has been working fine. I'm currently using it in gun safe to monitor humidity level.
2,Bad magnet mount and Fragile glass,"I bought this and calibrated it using the salt method and it was way off initially (read around 50% instead of 75%). After getting it calibrated and installing inside the lid of my humidor, I was happy with the product. Then after about a month, I opened the humidor to find that the hygrometer had fallen off of the place I mounted it. The metal disk that that was attached to the back of the hygrometer and holds it to the magnet mount (which I attached to the lid of the humidor) had detached from the hygrometer. When I tried to press it back on to the rear of hygrometer to secure it again, the *evidently very thin* glass on the front shattered.The item would have been fine if the metal disk that holds it to the magnet wouldn't have fallen off so easily. Mounting a hygrometer inside the lid of the humidor is a pretty standard thing to do, so for that use I can't recommend this product."
5,Simple,"I did the salt test to find out how much the meter was off, only 3 points so not too bad, but i'm sure every unit will be different. Small and simple, just what I was looking for."
1,Misidentified Item,"The picture is of a ""Western Digital"" hygrometer. Than isn't what you will receive if you order it.Sent mine back and they gave me credit with no problem.Wish Amazon would change image and name when they change vendors."
1,Low price for low quality,"This analog hydrometer looks cute, but it was very cheaply made. I bought three at one time, and even when calibrated, they couldn't agree on the humidity one day later. Even more, on one of my purchases, the dial just spun freely and could not be tightened down. I returned all for a refund. I suppose I will purchase a more expensive hygrometer that actually works next time."
3,Amazon,I am yet to receive my one order placed a month before. Placed on 07 October 2010 and not received yet. I was to come latest by 9 November 2010.
1,Inaccurate,"I have 2 other hygrometers, 1 is on a dehumidifier and another digital one. Both of the other hygrometers agree on the humidity, and disagree with this one. Even if I adjust the set screw so that the current humidity is accurate, it does not adjust properly when the humidity changes. It regularly says that the humidity is 10 - 20 percent higher than it really is."
1,Humidity reading was way off. Broke when calibrated.,"This thing was terrible. It was reading a whole 10% too high. I though the slot in the back was so you could calibrate it, but I screwed up the whole thing when I tried to turn it. Another piece of absolute worthless garbage. Keep looking."
1,Piece of Junk,This product did nothing as far as I could tell. I compared it to my known good hygrometer and this thing was way off and barely changed its display when the humidity changed. Amazon should discontinue selling it.
3,Just fine,I ordered two pieces and had different readings. Had to confirm using the salt test. One was down by 6 while the other by 9. But its normal. I guess you rarely get an accurate reading.
1,DOA - broke and not working,"This dial will not move in any direction on it's own. With the salt test, after 8 hours still hung at 40% -- moved dial to around 69% after turning the screw around and around. Now sitting in salt test at 69% for over 8 hours.. will not move at all. - One star but should be less than one star. just lost money on this one."
1,not that good,"This product does not seem to keep the right reading at all, it was stuck at about 85 and never seems to move while my other meters fluctuate all the time when the humidity changes in the humidors"
5,Works as Intended,"I had to calibrate these using a salt test, were only off by 5% RH but besides that couldn't be better."
1,Wildly Inaccurate,I bought two since they were cheap. Actually they turned out to be very expensive paper weights (they're no good at that either). I compared them to a pair of (accurate) digital hygrometers I use to monitor my guitar room and they both over-report humidity by as much as 20 percent. The digitals would indicate ~50 percent and the dials would be anywhere from 60 percent to 75 percent. That makes them worthless in my book.
1,Not worth the money.,"Bought three of those. One was halfway accurate, two really out there. Spare yourself the hassle and get a decent one. Might be forced to pay real money."
3,t.keough,This is a very small item. The diameter is about three inches and makes it difficult to read the dial. I can not rate its accuracy as I lack a comparison. It is not what I expected and should be advertised in a more accurate manner.
2,Broke after one week,"Worked great for a week, very accurate. Then stopped displaying humidity accurately. I was not rough with it and tried to tune it with screw on back, but it was already maxed out in the direction I needed."
2,Wrong Technical Description/Specs,"I ordered one as a gift, to replace a defective hygrometer in the front panel of a humidor. Although it states clearly it is 2.25 inches in diameter, it is not. It is 1.75 inches. I decided to keep it anyway, to use inside the humidor (it is too small to replace the broken one), but it is very disappointing to go through a selection process and have the product so clearly mislabeled. Otherwise, appears to be an accurate hygrometer."
3,Difficult,"This item did not come with any instructions. I know that the calibration of it is off and do not know how to calibrate it. I ended up just getting a digital one that works amazing - and this one goes up and down approximately the correct percentages - just at the wrong number. If I were to go back a few months, I would just get the digital one to begin with."
1,absolute rubbish,The one I received was completely non-functional (even tried putting it in a steamy bathroom but the needle never moded) and the company never responded to my email requesting a return.
1,"looks nice, not accurate","I've had mine for years - has a great classic vintage look - but it's not that accurate, I have to keep setting it - it will go out as much as 10-20 over the course of a few weeks - it looks nice but I'm not sure what to do with it since it's that far out. I recommend an adjustable digital one."
5,"Attractive, functional and inexpensive!","Delivery was prompt,reasonably charged and the two instruments I received work flawlessly. They are being placed in cases with expensive musical instruments and cost a mere fraction of the electronic version of the hygrometer."
1,"Item not as pictured - small at 1.75"" diameter","Received an item that is not as advertised. The hygrometer I received is 1.75"", not 2.25"". Also the dial is very different and difficult to read as the numbers are very small. Packaging was minimal, no type of stand provided for the meter. I'd give it less than one star if I could. I'll likely attempt to return this item."
1,Misidentified Item,"The one they sent doesn't look like the picture. The picture is of a ""Western Digital"" hygrometer. The hygrometer they sent me (which looks similar but not the same) isn't accurate at all. Is aBrass Analog Hygrometerby Cheaphumidors. The hygrometer feels very flimsy and cheap. I put it in the Boveda Humidipak and it read 48% (should have read 75%). When you calibrate it the entire face of the hygrometer will move along with the needle.Wish Amazon would change image and name when they change vendors."
3,needs improvement,"the hygrometer i received was not exactly the same as the one pictured or advertised but it still is elegant looking. the magnet it came with was detached from the back as it was only glued. not too good quality i might say about the glue. the needle also was a little bit wobbly. i calibrated it using the instructions on its website but when i picked it up to calibrate it from behind, the needle was moving around making it hard for me to pinpoint exactly where and how much i should move the needle based on the reading from the salt/water calibration. so now, i'm still not sure if it's properly calibrated or not."
2,Absolutely not satisfied,"While the product itself is fine, the advertising for this item is completely UNPROFESSIONAL and NOT upfront!!! You dont even know what it is that you are paying for!I normally buy this product from Kodak directly and there, they TELL you and you SEE what you are getting....What I mean is, you normally get to chose which kit you want, 25 page kit, 50 page kit, glossy, matt, etc. The norm is the 50 pg kit. That is what I assumed I was purchasing because Amazon's and Adorama Camera's ads do NOT state how many pages are included w/ your kit. I was very upset to know that I paid this amount for a 25 page kit. IT IS VERY MISLEADING AND NOT HONEST at all in my opinion. It simply states the following:Product FeaturesUnsurpassed photographic quality printsMatte and gloss finishesDurable, water-resistant printsLong-lasting, fade-resistant outputTotally dry... no waiting, no post-laminatingTechnical DetailsModel: 8172041Item Package Quantity: 1Hardware Platform: PC"
5,As expected...,I used this power strip for a MAME cabinet I was building. I needed to control 4 individual power sources. As you can see by my review it worked perfect.p.s. To install this I had to take it apart and run it through the hole I cut then put it back together.
4,"Works well after a replacement, good customer service","The only thing that's stopping this from 5 stars is that one port was dead when I got the first one. I called up American DJ and they had a new one out, which works perfectly, in 2 days. I was even able to keep the old one, so I have both in use, just don't use the 3rd port on the first one. Really solid and easy to use customer service. They were very helpful and easy to deal with."
3,Strange outlet location,"I also have two of the eight outlet/switch models and like them a lot. I needed to control power to two laser printers, outside of the UPS and selected this four outlet model. The outlets are located on top of the box instead of the normal rear position on most any other switch control boxs, including the eight outlet models. This design will even interfere with rack mounting, if one is so inclined. I just can't imagine why the company placed the outlets in this manner."
4,Good switch panel for what I'm using it for.,"This is a quality product at an excellent price. It is apparently designed for use with a portable sound/band system. I use it to easily turn on/off my router, modem, speakers, etc. The outlets on top, as mentioned in other reviews, make for a more cluttered look on a shelf. In our case this is not a big issue."
3,Flimsy Switches,"The rocker switches are very flimsy. I bought one of these 18 months ago and two of the four switches broke after 14 months of use (a couple of cycles a day on each switch for speakers and lamp). I really only used two of the plugs so I swapped to the still working pair and today one of those broke. I checked a couple of online parts dealers to see if I could just buy some replacement switches but by the time I buy three switches at $3 a piece and then spend $10 on shipping I'm better off just repurchasing the whole device through Amazon. I will, however, pull the last unbroken switch from my existing unit to keep as a spare."
4,Good for djs,"I am a mobile dj and use it for controlling lights. It is very good and I use it with the 8 channel switcher. This one has 4 channels and is very well built with metal, and the switches are good and are led lit so you can see them well. The switcher can Handle 500 watts per channel and has a 15 amp resettable breaker. I would recommend purchasing this for any uses that you need a switch for."
4,Good Switch System,"You know how you have to reboot your modem and router at times? If you are tired of having to unplug and replug in these devices, just get one of these. Lights show when they are powered up. We are getting these to install at our school in Haiti [...]so our staff can easily power cycle the computer gear when they need to."
4,Good read for both teens and adults,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book because I was told it was written for teens. I found that the plot kept me interested till the very end, and the subject matter was just as applicable to older readers. Aren't we all search for meaning in our life? We follow Peter, the main character, in his search and in turn do a bit of searching ourselves... I hope there is a sequel! Recommended."
2,Too top heavy!,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews but figured that my experience with this item might be helpful to someone who was having a hard time deciding between a few products. I bought this to replace a mismatched set that I'd had. It came quickly and look very nice in my kitchen. I ran into problems when I went to use the soup ladel, the pasta spoon and well ok, almost all of them. The problem? They are WAY too top-heavy. If I didn't it position exactly right against the side of the pot, the spoon/fork/whatever would tip right out, and usually fall to the floor to create a huge mess. I can't tell you how many times my husband has sworn and asked me why I replaced the old ones, before proceeding to tell me I HAD to get rid of the Oneida's. There is no reason to make the handle so heavy (I don't think anyway) I wouldn't recommend it unless the looks of it outweights the potential for a messy diaster."
3,DO NOT BELIEVE AMAZON'S REVIEW! NOT SUPER HERO HIGH!,"This tape is all animation of the DC Superheroes Captain Marvel, Cap. Marvel Jr. and Mary Marvel and has absolutely NO footage of the old ""Super Hero High"" live-action series from the 70's. Amazon's review of this item is wrong; NONE of the actors mentioned appear on this short (25 minutes) tape. The animation is great and the plot is actually good (rare for Filmation's attempts with DC heroes), so if you are a fan of Shazam (Captain Marvel) then buy a copy. However, please notice that this tape is recorded in SLP mode and the playback may not be very good on your VCR. If you are not a fan of the Big Red Cheese, save your money."
4,A useful book for NT Greek student,"for students of Ancient Greek, there's another choice focusing on Accentuation, Probert'sA New Short Guide to the Accentuation of Ancient Greek (BCP Advanced Greek & Latin Language) (BCP Advanced Greek & Latin Language). While Carson focus on NT Greek, Probert focus on a wider period, from Classical to Koine.Probert has some advantage:(1) Chapter I gives some info about the background and historical knowledge about Greek Accent, which is very interesting; (2) Chapter V give rules about the base form of noun words. (3) while it is a workbook as the author asserts, it can still be used as a referrence book.Carson's advantage is (1) list patterns of accents for every declention and conjugation, and even give lists of words fitting that pattern. (2) divided by lessons, and one can follow step by step.these two books can be read together to get a better understanding of the Greek accent."
5,Excellent book for learning principles of NT Greek accents,"This book is perfect for students of New Testament Greek who, like myself, want to know ""everything"" including accents which seem to be virtually ignored in most textbooks, particularly the more recently published ones."
3,Less expensive kits available,"I don't know why I didn't notice this before when I was shopping, but be advised that a 2-bottle kit is available elsewhere for $4.00 and under, or you can buy 4 bottles for about $12.00, etc. Also, the bottles shipped are not the ones pictured; they are the slightly opaque polypropylene bottles that don't have lids that could accomodate a nipple."
3,Only two bottles,Somehow I got the idea that there would be six bottles. There were only two. $!0.50 seems insanely expensive for only two bottles.
2,Animals do not fit well,"Difficult to put the animal pieces on the circus. She likes the toy, but it is difficult to play with."
2,It's so cute - but why don't they play with it?,"My five year old was a HUGE fan of all things Little People, so when daughter number two came along, I thought, ""How can I go wrong with more Little People stuff?"" Well, apparently Little People aren't her bag. Bummer deal, because this is really cute, but doesn't have much for the kids to do with it. Even my five year old who loves her Little People never really took to this. She's all about her imaginative play, but this for some reason seemed to be lacking something. I just never felt there was much that the kids could really DO with it that would keep them entertained... There are other Little People pieces that were so much more well received, like the house, the farm/barn, the carnival stuff with ferris wheel, the playground... those all have gotten hours of play. This particular item though seems to leave the kids baffled when it comes to stories. ?"
2,Don't buy this,"I am telling people not to buy this toy. Like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this toy causes injuries. My Daughter has scratched herself on it several times, and so have I. She also never played with it. Also, It is a VERY boring toy. With the money I paid for it, I expected more. I just try to sell it at a Garage Sale for $1, and I couldn't get rid of it. I ended up throwing it away, instead of donating it to Salvation Army with the other stuff I donated. You're better pff purchasing something else a little safer, and a little more fun."
4,this is great if you've never heard the quartets before,"if you are a shopper on the amazon scene you know that there are PLENTY of versions of the haydn quartets available; yet, they are contained within monstrous collections of wonderful yet expensive music -- and Mozart's quartets are very different from the piano concertos or the late symphonies which seem to be the apples of the eyes of the intelligent public. personally, i love all of Mozart's music -- it is practically all i listen to; if you are a crazed fan such as myself, you definitely need to become acquainted with the ""haydn"" quartets. But, if you are also poor like me you need to buy this CD. it's not the best available -- i personally like quartetto italiano. oh well! they are too expensive for my blood. one day i will bite my last bullet and buy their version; but for now, this collection is great! thanks for reading this arduous quasi-review, i hope it was helpful to you."
2,"Amazon says ""1990,"" but they are 1974 recordings","I was very disappointed. While Amazon's web page refers to ""1990"" in describing these CD's, they were in fact recorded 25 years ago in 1974. I do not consider that recordings that dated can produce quality of the kind we expect on a CD that says ""1990"" in its description.Only when the CD boxes arrive does one find out these dates."
3,Buy the right one,Make sure you measure the depth properly or else the product will break. I do not know how long they would last if I got the correct size. But they will not hold up with lock washers under them.
5,Essential Even For the Gettysburg Expert,"It is rare to find an informative, entertaining, and concise travelogue on any destination, much less one as important as Gettysburg. But, Hallowed Ground is a welcome exception to that situation. McPherson uses his experiences and research to provide the reader with a comprehensive look at both the battlefield and the battle. The anecdotes he offers add a depth to the text that is surprising given its brevity. That he provides this depth with a dash of humor only enhances satisfaction with the book. In fact, my only regret is that I didn't have this book when I toured Gettysburg. Consequently, it is easy for me to say that Hallowed Ground is a worthy addition to any Civil War buff's library, and a necessary companion for any Gettysburg visitor."
2,Disappointed,"Disappoined. While the author says he could walk the battlefield blind folded, he must have been blindfolded when it was written. The Irish Brigade monument is on Sickles Ave. not Ayres. And it's obvious he does not like the park officials. The author comes off as an elitist. He talks about how there is so much more to the field than what was covered in a 'novel' and movie (which i agree) but he then goes over all the same points found in this 'novel'. Nothing new here, and with no maps inside and back tracking and going forward with no reference point, not a great book to use if you're walking the battlefield. Luckily i only borrowerd the copy i read."
3,Mcpherson forgot his GPS,the author speaks as if you know where he is standing. in the next revision please take gps locations. the map is too small to be usable in the kindle version which for some reason cannot be zoomed.
1,Give it a few months and then it will die on you,"I bought mine in February of 2009, it is now June 2009 and it is dead. Won't hold charge. Avoid this cheap imitation at all costs!"
1,Battery died in two months company does not respond,All I bought this battery as replacement for my dell laptop. The battery held zero charge after two months. I contacted the company via amazon they never contacted me back.Buyer Beware
1,Battery,this was labeled that it works for Inspiron 9300... well i have one. and it doesn't work AT ALL.
4,Amazing collection by Mina,"I love this compilation of Mina's song. I grew up in Italy and I remember some of her greatest hits, especially in the 60's."
2,Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb,"I didn't realize it was just a book for tourists, with very little historical information on the presidents."
4,Nice compact camera,"I bought one of these last September, and really like it, as do my friends. It's very small and compact, and takes decent photos, enough for most snap happy people. I agree about the night time stuff. I dark light, the camera has to be a certain distance away. Too close and everything is white, too far away, and there's little to be seen, but you soon get used to it.Very good in sunlight, although it does put a hue on the picture that some people might find annoying, but I kinda like it. Works very well with Mac OS X and iPhoto, and also compatible with XP without drivers but don't know what software is like."
1,A waste of money,"I got this camera as a gift and while I first was very excited about having a camera which is so small you can take everywhere, I am now deeply disapointed. I guess I was very stupid to expect a Dimage Xg-like performance from a cheapo camera. The only condition where the camera seems to make somewhat decent photos is in cloudy daylight.Don't even dream about making photos with the flash. Either under- or overexposed. Generally I am ""throwing"" 9 out of 10 photos away. The camera has serious exposure problems, the pictures always come out fuzzy and always a little ""blue-ish"". Recycling time is decent if the flash is off, if the flash is on (even if you did not use the flash - flash set to automatic) it takes *forever* to take the next shot.If you look for a snapshot camera which you can take anywhere, buy a disposable film camera, you will make much better pictures with it."
5,Truly an intellectual and historical adventure,"Kudos to the author for this amazing work. Follows the story of Aristotle's ideas and actual manuscripts from ancient Greece through the renaissance. At many junctures these pivotal works of philosophy which are at the very core of Western civilization could have easily been lost/destroyed, but for the efforts of a few select scholars and monks in Europe and the Middle East, most of whom are listed and named specifically, which must have taken an amazing amount of research. Both philosophically and historically fascinating for anyone interested in either."
2,The more we listen to foreign recordings...,"The more we listen to foreign recordings, the more we understand, that the Bolshoi is was and always will be the one and only home of Russian opera. The history of Khovanstchina and the Shostakovich instrumentation of it is on my review of the Gergiev acount of the opera (under the name Moskvich). Since I recomend only the Rimskiy-Korsakov version, you should choose one of the three Bolshoi recordings made by Nebolsin, with Reizen, Krivchenia, Maksakova, Bolshakov and Khanayev (1952); Khaikin, with Ognivtsev, Krivchenia, Arkhipova, Piavko and Maslennikov (1974) or Ermler, Nesterenko, Eisen, Obraztsova, Lomonosov and Raikov (1988). If you still need the Shostakovich version, you should choose the soviet film (conductor Svetlanov)."
5,A perfect match!,Bose makes high quality products with both style and acoustics in mind. These stands look great and elevate the speakers to a hight that is optimal for listening without becoming a tip hazard. The large footprint on the bottom of the stand provides the stability while the rubber feet on the top prohibit vibrations. I am completely satisfied with this product. High quality speakers deserve a premium pedastal and these are it.
2,Would be a bargain at half the price,"I love my Bose speakers and was hoping for a good stand that would allow me to place them properly in the room, but these stands look and feel cheap to me. From 20 feet away they look fine, but up close they look cheap."
4,Any (oxy)moron could assemble these,"While the description of this item is oxymoronic (""speaker floor stands"" are noted as being ""Bookshelf"" stands), they do, in fact, simply stand on the floor. Given the direct-reflecting characteristics of the Bose 301 speakers they allow you to maneuver and position the stands for the best audio location/optimal Bose performance. They are heavy duty. The holes in the top and bottom plates are countersunk so it is easy to identify and determine which way to install these plates (i.e., the head of the machine screws fits flush with the plate and into the countersunk portion of the plate). Being able to run speaker wire through the stand is nice as well."
3,Wobbles,Easy to assemble. Blends in with decor. The base and top plates are anchored with two screws each so there is a side to side wobble.
5,Bose FS-1,Stands are stylish yet simple in design. The only thing that could improve them would be a way to permanently mount the speaker to the stand.
1,Be Careful,I have been looking for a collection of videos by Depeche Mode. I purchased this cause I liked the songs listed. When I got it the region was wrong. It looks like all the ones available are not able to be played in the USA so BE CAREFUL. I'm currently trying to get a refund on a return of the dvd. Not fun!

5,Works great!,"We ordered two of these for our 4 year old daughter who refused pull ups but still wet the bed several times a week. They are nice and soft, so she likes that. Our old ones were scratchy. They are so nice and large and stay in place pretty well, she sometimes kicks it down toward the end of her bed in her sleep. I am thinking of sewing Velcro on the edges of the pads and matching Velcro on her sheet so that it never slips. It doesn't leak at all, we have been using them for 2 weeks now. I would recommend them very highly!"
5,perfect for potty training toddlers!,I bought two for my DD for bed-time training. They are perfect to avoid complete sheet/blanket changes in the middle of the night! They wash great too.
4,good bedpad,"I recently purchased 3 of this item and then purchased another 3 of them. My husband has physical problems and these bedpads have helped me keep him dry and comfortable, which is so important. They are a good size to wash easily and so far are holding up well."
4,Good for toddlers,I bought this for my son who wanted to sleep without a diaper but wasn't quite waking up dry yet. I bought two so that it would cover the whole bed. They work well- no urine gets through to the sheets below. A couple of complaints though- first the size doesn't really cover the whole bed. I wish it were wider so that I could tuck it in so it wouldn't move around. My son also doesn't like sleeping on it. It is a little rough and stiff. He always complains. So what we do now is I put it under his sheets to protect the mattress. Not really what I purchased it for but otherwise he just complains too much about it.
5,Great product!,These work great! I bought a few 3 or 4 years ago. They have held up well and are still being used. I just need to add more to the rotation. Fast shipping and a great value!
1,liquid goes right through this!!!!,I purchased this for my 3 pound Maltese in case she cannot go outside for over 6 hours and the one area that she urinated on went right through! I surely could not count on this a bed! It was went on both sides!Don't buy it!!!
4,Great price for this product,I work in Assisted Living and these pads meet all the expectations of the best I've seen. They are a little stiff until washed a few times.
3,"Absorbent, but don't stay put","I bought this product to use for my potty training 3-year-old who is having problems at night again. The pads are a good size and absorbent enough, but they don't stay put. He wiggles around a lot before sleeping and while he's sleeping and they slide around and bunch up. I don't know if there is a better solution, though."
5,Bed Pads,"Found this reusable bedpad product to be excellent.Sturdy, waterproof, comfortable to rest on,and easy wash and dry.Economical and environmentally better thanthe disposable bed 'chucks;."
4,Very Nice Bed Pads,"I've now had them for well over a year. They are washed every 2 to 4 days (not sure exactly since I purchased 4 of them, and all four are used.I just now measured them and they measure 47and 3/4 inch by 32 and 1/4 inch.So that's how much shrinkage can be expected with a fair amount of washings.* They have only been washed in cold water, I have the hot water valve to my washer turned off."
5,very good product,"I ordered this product to be used as protection for dog pee pads. They protect the floor from any urine that might spill off of the doggie pad. They have been washed often and hold up very nicely. Great product, worth every penny!"
5,Great product,Critical to use in tandem with a bed wetting alarm product such as the malem. Highly recommend getting one or two.
4,bedpads,"These work very good until they have been washed several times and then it seems they are less water prof, but over all I think this is a good product and I would purchase again"
5,Excellent product,The product was just as they had written. It is high quality and will last for many years. Thank you
5,Excellent item at a great price!,"These bed pads are excellent quality, washable in hot water with bleach, and are very comfortable to sleep on. The alternative, disposable kind tend to bunch up and slide, are noisy and are bulky when disposed of (not environmentally friendly), although they can be handy. These are very economical if bed pads are needed often, and are handy to have on hand when picking up kids after they've been swimming, or to put down when a guest needs to change a baby's diaper. These are an extra measure of protection (chair, bed or carseat) for urinary incontinence. I recommend buying two or three so you always have a nice fresh one available, and checking out the different sizes available to meet your needs. The price is very competitive, as they sell for much more elsewhere. Compared to disposables, these are an excellent value for the money, and are a real time saver considering the effort it takes to completely change bedding."
5,Great for pets too!,"I use these for my geriatric dogs. When my dog had a UTI, she soaked the pad and it absorbed everything and kept her bedding dry. They wash up nice and are a ""must have"" in the house."
2,Reusable Bedpads.,The bedpad I purchased was not waterproof.The add state it absorbs 1000cc.But it did not.I would not buy this product again.
5,Does the job at a great price,"We needed bed pads for our 4-year-old foster daughter, but we hesitated about buying these; they were considerably cheaper than the others we looked at, and we were afraid it might be ""you get what you pay for."" But we decided to give them a try and are very glad we did - they are a great value. They are comfortable and soft, stay in place all night, and absorb the nighttime pee of a 31-pound child with no problem. Our only possible objection involves what is basically a good feature: they seem to wick the moisture away, so that the pad still feels semi-dry to her. The behavioral therapist she works with says it's better if she feels wet, so this feature might be a minus for us, but since her pajamas are wet, we figure it's okay. Laundering is easy and you can either air-dry or use the dryer (I've done both). We bought three and I am back for more so I can supply some for parent visits."
2,not enough absorbant material,"I ordered these as they looked similar to some others I had ordered before. The first night I used it was not good at all, and it was a very good thing I had full mattress protector under the sheet or the bed would have bed stained with urine. I returned these and found the ones I like (soff quilt-Fiber links, more money, but they have more inner material that works. I have had these and washed them many times and they are holding up well. I use them for a almost four year old that still has ""accidents"" at night."
4,It does a great job on our twin bed,"My daughter is 4 and still has an occasionaly accident, I use this as a back-up while the other matress covered is being washed and put it UNDER the fitted sheet, no problems at all."
2,not the same as the last one,"I've ordered this same product twice now. The first was exactly as described, with a quilted soft blue cover. This second one is not the same pad. It has a rather coarse white cotton cover and is not quilted together so the front and back layers shift separately into an odd shape. I was disappointed but needed the pad so I kept it . . . it is still waterproof and washable, which are the most important features I was looking for."
3,GREAT until they melted,"I was just about to order more of these because they worked really well for us, but i put them in a dryer with a mattress bad and somehow the backs melted so that they're not able to lay flat. I was really surprised by this. So if you do buy them, they work well, but be careful about drying them. They need low heat and they need to be in a relatively empty dryer (e.g. able to be tossed around). I wish I'd known..."
2,Not what I expected,"I was choosing something with cotton with the hope it will be a little soft, ..or more plush..or something that you cannot feel too much under..Not the case..waist of money, I would have returned if I didn't have to pay for that too..so..disappointing."
2,created diaper rash,"Not very protective for children, created diaper rash. I'd keep away from this brand. Yes the pads are very absorbent and prevent any urine from getting into the dog bed stuffing but what about the diaper rash."
3,bedpads,"They work ok, not the most absorbent ones out there. Wash well, dry well, but like I said, it's not the best one."
5,Reuseable Bedpads,"Purchased 2 of these pads for a special needs child (4 year old) that I work for to be ""greener"" and for comfort over using the disposable plastic pads. These pads are great, they are soft and cool. I was so happy with these pads that I purchased 6 more pads! I do not know how well they absorb liquid since we use them to keep the sheets free from sweat but would assume they are good at asorbing liquids."
2,One major flaw,"These pads stop the wetness but after you wash them the corners turn up and you can't get them to lay flat so it leaves a bump under the sheet. I would recommend buying round cornered pad, they work much better."
4,So far so good,So far this product has worked pretty well with my daughter but for my son who is a heavy bed wetter this didn't quite get it. The pad is thin and soft. It doesn't make noise and stays in place even with wild sleeping children. It seems better than a lot of other pads I've used so far. I especially like the fact the back is not vinyl which eventually tears up after washing. I would have rated it 5 stars but I just wish that it was thicker or absorb more for heavy soakers.
5,Bedpads,Works great. My mom needed them for the nursing home and was totally pleased with them. Great buy for the price!
3,Does Not Stay in Place,"I bought this for my son until we get over nighttime wetting issues but I was disappointed to see that it doesn't stay in place. I can't comment on how absorbant it is because every morning I find it either on the floor or at the foot of the bed. In different circumstances I guess it would be better, but I don't recommend it for anyone who moves around in their sleep."
4,"Works really well, but ...","Some reviews promise it won't slide around on the bed. It does, for me. A lot. I admit I move around a lot in bed at night. I've doubled up on the Tranquility booster inserts (I drink ALOT of water during the day to avoid dehydration and feel great.) Tonight, I'll use some large safety pins, strategically and CAREFULLY placed to avoid tearing, to keep it stable, just where I need it most, then cover it with a large towel. I haven't washed it yet but I have air dried it in the dryer. That works fine. Then I spray it with odor control. Maybe I'll wash it every third time so it doesn't fall apart in the washer from over washing. Maybe I'll buy another one. Or two.The truth is, there is NO system I've yet found yet that addresses my typical old guy problem of ""REALLY gotta go, gotta go, gotta go"" five and six times a night. Medication (Flowmax) expensive and makes me so dizzy I run into things in my power chair.I'm homing in on the system that works best for ME. Yee ha!"
5,Great for a Queen mattress,"I purchased this bed pad to protect my fitted sheet and mattress from possible spills, water, blood, and other damaging or staining products. Its 52 inches cover the width of my queen mattress almost entirely, and it seems to stay in place during bedtime. The blue part makes it somewhat rigid, but the upper soft part is made of cotton (I guess) and is gentle to touch. Although summer time, I don't find it to have any warming properties, so it's like this bed pad is not even there. The fact that it's advertised as being waterproof and washable is a great feature, also. Very fast service, and good quality overall."
5,reusable bedbads,Satisfied with quality. Washes well. Comfortable to skin. Absorbs according to specifications. Would certainly order again. The underside of pad seems to assist with transfers.
5,These really do the job!,"After 19 years of dealing with our disabled daughter's incontinence, we decided to look for a product like this to save us stripping her bed and washing sheets and a matress pad every day. We bought six of the 1000 cc (1 Liter) size because she wears a disposable diaper and before she leaks on the bed a lot of of the leakage is absorbed into the diaper. We've had these for two months and wonder why we waited so long. They are great! They absorb all the excess urine, have been washed multiple times already and are holding up great. They are also soft and comfortable. We now put them on furniture she sits on in the house and on our leather car seats when she rides in the car. Great product, I'll buy them again when these wear out."
3,"Absorbant pad, but slides around on the bed","I bought two of these pads for my son who is learning to make it through the night without bedwetting. The pads are absorbant enough, however he is an active sleeper which often causes the pad to bunch up or move around quite a bit. For him I wish I had gotten one with ""tucks"" that tuck under the mattress."
5,Great product,This is a great product. It holds a lot of liquid. I just put it in the washing machine and dryer and back on the bed.
4,really liked this product,I am happy about this product and bought another one. I would really recommend it to anyone to use for kids especially. very nice and thoughtful design. Thank you
4,"perfect, well almost","The pad is great; good quality. I knew before I got it that it would not stay put, but I was so sick of changing my sons sheets from night training I had to figure out a way to use them. They do sell ones with straps and flaps, but to me that's the same amount of work as putting on new sheets. So, I got an area rug gripper and put it under the pad. It works pretty well. I still have to straighten it before bedtime, but it solved the problem of moving to the bottom of the bed each night. I also bought a more expensive pad, but it is pretty much the same as this cheaper one. I haven't needed to wash it yet, so I'll update if it falls apart :)*update* An easier way of keeping pad from slipping down is to put a large beach towel over it. The rug gripper was ok, but still did get kicked around and messed up. Gone through many washes and dry cycles and is just fine."
5,"Works well, but could be longer","My two-year-old milk-lover's diaper often leaks overnight, so I tried this Blue Max waterproof bed pad, and also the Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector. I put them under the sheet, and wash & dry them with the sheets. Both have been washed and dried about half a dozen times, and still look new. The only drawback I've noticed is that they don't stay perfectly flat against the mattress, but they're pretty close. I wanted a couple more, and I chose the Priva instead of the Blue Max, because of it's longer length. The longer pad comes to within a foot of the head and foot of the bed. The Blue Max pad is roughly square, and a little narrower than a twin bed. If I were buying this for an adult, I probably wouldn't care about the length difference; even all of my toddler's wet spots have been within the area covered by the Blue Max pad. And the Blue Max is less bulky, if you want to bring it with you for travel."
5,I'm glad i ordered these,"I bought two of these for my 6 yr old who still wets the bed almost every night. I was impressed the very first night i used these. She had wet the bed, but when i got her out of bed the mat was dry. It was absorbed all the mositure, but it didn't stay on the surface. I bleach these regulary, but i haven't seen any wear and tear on them. I'm very impressed."
1,Horrible,"First of all the description says ""bed pads"" plural! There is 1 bed PAD. Non plural. It came in the mail package with no wrapping or anything, almost as if it was used. My son used it one night and pee went right through it onto the bed and sheets. This item is CRAP!"
3,Good product...but it doesn't really stay in place !,"Love the size, quality and product. But the only downfall, is that it won't stay in position on the mattress, there is no grip, so it tends to shuffle around out of place more often, which becomes annoying."
2,"Slides and bunches up, won't stay put","I don't know how this stays in place for others, but it sure doesn't for me. The plastic or whatever on the back is very slick and it goes everywhere, bunches up all over the place.I ordered 2 and so far have only opened one in case I decide to send that one back. Intend to try sewing something to the back of this one to help it get a grip on the sheet. Unsure how that'll work. And I'm not very happy at having to go to the trouble and expense of trying to fix it."
4,It just might be the thing...,"It's a LOT more comfortable than the disposable pads: when it's dry, the fabric next to your skin is pleasantly soft and not scratchy. It stays put where it's needed, and won't slide around on the bed. It's a lot less likely to feel clammy in warm weather. And it doesn't make that tell-tale crinkly pastic noise. When it's damp, the fabric helps to wick the moisture away from your skin. Plus, it's eco-friendly, if that's your deal: fewer pads in the landfill is good, right? Just take care to wash it well: make sure it's not crowded into a load with a dozen pairs of jeans, or it's not gonna get clean. Yecchh, especially if you put it away even the slightest bit damp. I've got four."
5,Excellent item at great price!,"These bed pads are excellent quality, washable in hot water with bleach, and are very comfortable to sleep on. The alternative, disposable kind tend to bunch up and slide, are noisy and are bulky when disposed of (not environmentally friendly), although they can be handy. These are very economical if bed pads are needed often, and are handy to have on hand when picking up kids after they've been swimming, or to put down when a guest needs to change a baby's diaper. These are an extra measure of protection (chair, bed or carseat) for mild urinary incontinence. I recommend buying two or three so you always have a nice fresh one available, and checking out the different sizes available to meet your needs. The price is very competitive, as they sell for much more elsewhere. Compared to disposables, these are an excellent value for the money, and are a real time saver considering the effort it takes to completely change bedding."
2,Won't stay put...,"The product is not non-slip and it is not very thick or heavy. It bunches up with every movement. After one night, I bundled up my purchase and returned them all. Never got to test the washability or durability of the product."
5,Great bedpads!,"Love these pads! My daughter is 3 years old and is tube fed through the night so she is constantly going through her diapers if I don't get to her in time during the night. The pad is soft, doesn't move around and is absorbent. It does not leak through to the underside. I love that it's not plastic on the underside so it avoids the plastic crinkling sound others make. They wash super well without shrinking and maintains its shape. Thanks for less bed sheet washings!"
4,Reusable Bedpads,"Very nice product - I do however find that they do slip & become uneven under you & wish that were not so. otherwise, seems to be quality product."
5,great value,These are a great price and work well for potty training. Similar products were almost 3 times as much! The only down side is that they are not big enough to tuck into the sides of the mattress. This has worked out fine though because they do stay put in the bed.
1,Sent the wrong product AND has warning on back,"As with another reviewer I ordered the Blue Max pad and instead was sent the Invacare pad. Not only is this the wrong pad but there is also a warning on the back saying ""Not suitable for use by children under the age of 12."" I do not know why this is the case and can only hope that others with children see this warning and do not buy this pad!"
1,not effective bed pad,"Based on my success with 4 other pads made by this company, I purchased this pad to take with us on vacation in case my husband indicated he wanted it on the bed. I am grateful that I took another one and put it under the sheet, because this specific pad being reviewed was not effective. My husband, who had bladder surgery, had consumed too much water, was cold during the night, and became incontinent. The sheet was soaking wet in the morning. After I washed it, I checked the stitching and LO ! It looks like the needle used for the stitching was too large for the fabric. There are indeed spaces around the stitching which allowed fluid to pass through. I am clearly disappointed with this purchase; it is useless."
2,Could not get rid of plastic smell after numerous washes.,The odor of this product really made it too yucky to use. May work better under sheets; we tried it above and the pad kept bunching -- it's not stiff. I'd keep looking for a better product.
3,Good and Not So,"I bought a 34"" x 36"" for under my husband but, even though it absorbs great, it does not stay in place. Instead of the wet being caught by the pad, the pad ends up somewhere else and the bed gets wet, anyway. I will use it elsewhere but, it is useless on the bed."
2,comfortable but not very absorbent,"It's very comfortable, and washes well. However, it is not all that absorbent. Every night, it leaks through the pad onto the sheet."
4,Does the job.,Did the job in one small accident by my daughter. But the pad doesn't stay in place as well as described - it moves a bit.
3,"good product, but one pad doesn't quite cut it","I am taking care of an elderly relative with confusion and incontinence issues.I like the size of the pad, compared to the other pads that are out there, and it seems to absorb a lot of fluid, but with my relative one pad wasn't enough.I switched to a extra-fluid absorbing night-time adult diapers and put two of these pads underneath. That worked much better, but it generated a lot of laundry. (And there were nights when there were multiple incidents of incontinence, where I was short of pads, because I only had 4.)With the frequent washing, the pads have started to become ""pilly"" and rough against his skin, so I have started putting a softer pad designed for use with babies as the over pad - with these pads underneath.Next I will be trying vinyl pants over his night diapers to see if that works better."
3,Not that absorbent,"Not as absorbent as hoped, leaves the occupant lying in a soppy puddle, but serves its purpose to keep matress dry and not change so many sheets."
5,get several!!,"these take all the hassle of 'accidents' out of the equation! just throw into the wash & use another while it's being cleaned... in fact, get several if accidents occur frequently-- i've used them for over a year with alot of bleaching, washing, drying and they're still in really good shape!"
4,"Good price, small pad","I use these for my son who still wets the bed. They are absorbent and usually the underside stays dry so there's little transfer to the bed. I wish they weren't square, but rather rectangular so they can be placed higher on the bed, Sometimes he will piddle a LOT and it will extend past the margins of the pad."
5,pleased,These were a great size and of good quality..I would definetely buy more. I would recommend these for anyone who needs them.
3,Pretty good read.,"I have tried very hard to get into this series. I like them enough that I keep reading them as the come out, but not so much as some of the other current authors. I really wish there were more Barbara Jaye Wilson books available. She writes a good humorous book."
2,not comfortable,"I didn't find these comfortable for extended periods (I was unable to wear them for more than 30 minutes or so), and they don't attenuate sound as well as several similar products. I'm going back to the classic yellow ear plugs."
1,Pathetic,"I haven't seen this movie but I've been wanting to for a very long time.After trying numerous times to get a copy, free or purchasable, but found nothing until I saw it on Amazon.Amazon, unfortunately, is only entertaining credit cards and billing addresses of the US. This is pathetic. Simply pathetic."
1,Afrasiabi: An IRI agent,The book opines Khamenei's position as well as the buffoon himself could have done! Kaveh Afrasiabi's book does not come close to the stature of the Mein Kampf but of the author tries harder the second edition may come as a close second.
1,Iran's Nuclear Program: : Debating Facts Versus Fiction,"This book is written by Kaveh L. Afrasiabi, an advisor of past president of Islamic Republic, MULLAH Khatami. It provides interviews with the past key nuclear decision-makers in Islamic Republic, Europe, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The history of Iran's nuclear program is old and goes back to Pahlavi Dynasty, which could be completed by now. Afrasiabi presents a marketing case for the current so-called Islamic Regime in Iran , drawing on his first-hand knowledge of the system. Thanks."
5,A/C Filter,It was hotter than **** mid-summer when the air conditioner went out. Got the correct filter X6675 Lennox 20x25x5 MERV 16 the next day at the best price available (had called some Air Conditioning companies around town). Didn't have to risk some employee on commission coming out to sell me something I didn't need. Very happy.
1,"False advertising, price and picture","The item Lennox HCC-16 air fiter is Lennox Healthy Carbon Clean 16. This includes a carbon filter to absorb odors. THe one filter that I recieved was a generic replacement that was clear, white, that does not have the carbon to filter out odors. Aso, note that the picture shown and the Lennox item correspond to the carbon coated media filter (not the one that I received). This is false advertising, and the price that was charged is 3 times the price of a similar generic version, without the carbon, and not for the branded Lennox Carbon Clean 16."
4,great filter,Cheapest I can find for this particular filter on Amazon. Was a fast delivery! It has been almost a year and will need to reorder it again soon.
5,Amazing Filter,This filter arrived early and was in excellent shape. The filter is great for anyone with allergies. We have noticed a big difference in the house. I would highly recommend this filter.
1,Anyone ever heard of 'trademark searches'?,"For those looking for Kerry Leimer's brilliant ambient/jazz/fusion group of the 1980s, look elsewhere. This is most definitely not what this is, and _these_ people needed to do a bit more checking before having settled on this name, given that _that_ group had three records out before these guys were likely out of Jr. High. Boo...hiss!"
2,"Please, Get on the band wagon like everyone else!","This band plays metal music. They're good, but hey face it. They should get on the band wagon, and play like Limp Bizkit, Korn. I had to give them two stars cause they are good musicians. But c'mon guys, metal,like Elvis...IS DEAD!"
4,One of the best new bands i've heard,"Savant has alot of varity!! Heavy one minute, slow and melodic the next. Not noise!! Just good metal music!"
3,who's chris nixon?,"this cd is very good. if you dig metallica and iron maiden then it's for you. if not then don't bother. but i'm curious because the drummer on the cd is listed as jason bibber,yet someone named chris nixon is credited. the drumming is good as is the rest of the musicianship. but give credit where credit is due."
4,This CD truly is The Dawning..For the rebirth of good METAL!,"It is about time something good has come form the states. When I heard of this band on-line I didn't beleave what I read. But I was wrong! If this band catches fame they will raise good metal music from the ashs. They arn't the rap/metal genre, that has become boring with metal bands from the US.And most people my age(20) want to hear bands like savant instead of Korn. They are great, plane and simple. They can never replace Metallica, but they are the first band I've heard come close. I urge any metal fan to ad this CD to there collection."
4,GLAD TO SEE HEAVY BANDS CAN STILL PLAY GOOD!!!!!!,"This band is great. The songs aren't that fast, but they are tight and well written. SAVANT seems to have very powerful musicianship as well as intelectual lyrics. They show a varity of styles in their songs. They're songs have an emotional quality thats great. You can tell this band puts a piece of themselves into thier music. If you're into heavy music that isn't afraid to be melodic and soft at times I'd recommend buying this CD. This band definatly should be more popular. I can't wait to see them live!"
4,Great Kids Cam,"I bought this camera because the price was right. Obviously you're not getting a quality camera, but what you will get is a great camera for kids to begin learning about photography.Some of the pros:*Size*You never have to replace the battery...just plug it into the USB port and it recharges.Cons:*Size of pics are small (great for emailing, but horrible for printing)*It doesn't fit enough hi-res pictures on the camera"
2,tiny but low quality,It really is very small. But the pictures are poor and the framing is very difficult. The software is good.
2,ineffective for me,"This product did not remove cat urine smell from my carpet. I followed instructions exactly. I can""t afford wasting money, is there a guarantee for reimbursement?"
4,glad I went back for this one,"I thought the most recent albums must be the best, but this is just as good. Excellent addition of fiddle/clarinet - gives the songs a whole extra dimension. Every album of Eilen's that I've heard has been enjoyable from start to finish."
5,Jewel - Letters from Sinners & Strangers,"Truly enjoy this album. It runs in my car CD player every day in my work commute. Though the lyrics is supposed to be on the downside the music is not, it has a nice beat."
2,I just don't like it,"I am a prog music fan, I like old Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd, The Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Neil Morse as a solo artist, Peter Gabriel and so on. I am sorry to tell that I just don't like this cd. Sorry, but I have to leave a rating reflecting my idea. Don't take it too personnal, it is just a matter of taste."
3,OK...Not To Be Conceited About,"To be honest I was expecting more from Remy with her debut with all her buzz on the hit records ""Lean Back"", ""Yeah,Yeah,Yeah"", you would think she would have better marketing and sales. If she would've did a video with Neyo for ""So Good"" she would've at least hit Gold status. Terror Squad fail to do their job with promoting Remy Ma. Good luck next go-round."
3,This is a good album.,"There's something about remy is released today on the 6th anniversary of the death of her mentor Big Pun.This is a very good album with remy doing her work with some good songs on there.Conceited is a very good one, the album follows every step of the way to the end.This is very decent and nice albumSo Thumbs Up for Me."
3,The Bronx CAN do it better than this,"Remy is not bad at all; however, she lacks the depth and maturity of a true Hip Hop icon like NAS or RAKIM. Maybe this is because she is being controlled by Fat Joe, who was my hero back in the day but has since let flakes like 50 Cent put huge holes in his street rep. She raps about dealing drugs and being this gangsta' bitch but for some reason I'm not buying it. She has potential but needs to grow up, especially if she is representing the place where Hip Hop began. Even then, she is better than most of the wack female talent out right now."
5,REMY MA,"Remy album is really good I really love it but I feel she needs to be more Lady like because in her album she always talking smoking but her album is really based on a ture story you really have to listen to the last two songs.I really like her album because you can listen to the whole album and not turn to the next song and with the help of Big Pun, Neo, and Keyshia Cole it made her album even better. I feel that she is the next Lil Kim and you can tell that she really worked hard on this album and didnt throw anything together."
1,Just a fake Lil Kim,I had the diaster of seeing Remy Ma perform. She is trying to be a fake Lil Kim. She was cool when she wasnt free style but when she raps its all about sleeping with somebody else man. Lil Kim does that but in such a better way. Remy Ma is not going to be around for long. I couldnt stomach the rest of her performance it was way to much vuglar. I mean she cuss more than the guys. I think that she will not be around for long since Lil Kim is out!!!
5,Remy Ma,"This CD is fire, she's a hot lyricist.Her words speak nothing but truth, I really wish her continued success in everything she does.Dont sleep on her!"
5,FIRE!!!,"Yo we have been hurtin for a lil while and needed something like this to come out. Fo Sho, this ALBUM IS LIQUID CRACK YO!Seriously if you like GOOD MUSIC you are gonna love this album yo. She has tight beats, diverse range of songs, and an ILL FLOW GAME. I promise its like one of my favorite albums to date.Maybe i was so hungry for some good music that I am exaggerating, but the album is definetly FIRE!!!!GO GET IT YO!!!!!"
1,All the dead guest rappers in the world won't make this an enjoyable cd.,"I got this on the strength of ""Conceited"" because I think that's a really cool, fresh-sounding song. Plus, I thought Remy's rhymes on ""Lean Back"" were the best part of that song. What a boring disappointment. Maybe I didn't listen to this album enough times, but each song sounded pretty much the same to me. Boring, noisy, monotonous describes this album well. It exemplifies what is wrong with most rap records: only one good song, a ton of filler and skits.Download the single and save yourself the cash."
2,females suck!!,"Really don't care for female emcees I give her respect for shoutin bx all day and for not talkin about d!ck or how good she sucks it like trina, kim & fox or use a tom boy imagine for attention like brat or claim she spitting the hardest and use girly production like eve.Remy is the rawest after rah digga on the mainstream but there nothing creative or different here. love song, street joints, ballad joint, even a south joint and mainstream attention type songs.2.5/5 for raw ill true lyricism without the happy days feel and rawness of the old days when hip-hop was fresh, buy rah-digga and underground female emcee jean grae."
4,really 3.7 stars out of 5 but i'll give it a 4,"I like remy, this female can rap, but the beats aren't all that, i've never been a fan of Terror Squad's (the group she with) beats, they all sound the same (lean back) and don't have any character, but other than that, she has some bangers.i believe she needs to sign somewhere else enable to do a better album with better beats, and get recognized a little more than she is"
4,1 OF THE BEST FEMALE MC'S,"THIS MY GIRL, WHEN SHE FIRST CAME OUT, ITHOUGHT SHE WAS TRY-N TO BE LIEK LIL KIM...IM SORRY LYRICALLY SHE GOT KIM....THE BEST MC'S OF THE 90'S THROUGH NOW ARE/......ANDIM JUST NAME-N THEM NOT PUTTING THEM IN ORDERGANGSTA BOOREMY MACHARLI B-MORELIL KIMTRINATHESE 5 GIRLS ARE BAD.. LYRICS.. BUT NOW IMMA SAY THE BEST.. GANGSTA BOO GOT THE REST....... SHE MADE 3 6 MAFIA..."
2,Disappointed Buyer,"I purchased and have been studying the Kaplan book and have become quite disouraged. Who was the one who was supposed to edit this book? I have several areas where the questions asked and the available answers do not match the answers said to be correct in the answer key. For example, a question asking the correct spelling of a word was already correct so I chose that as my answer to the question. When I turned to the answer key, the word in the question should have been misspelled. This type of thing did not only happened in the grammar section, but also in Math and Social Studies. Now I wonder if I have spent the whole summer studying for a test that I will fail because the book I used to study from was poorly written. I am also wondering if the material that I don't know is correct or if there are other mistakes."
2,Not satisfy,"I really like the leather material of this bag, the design and the size of the bag is perfect for me. However, the shoulder strap was broken only after 3 uses. The metal clip holding the strap together came loose and now I can't even use it because of the broken shoulder strap. I have to ship it back to Italy and have to pay for the shipping to get it repair. I received the bag less than one month from the seller, and used it only 3 times, the strap was broken already. I am very disappointed at the quality of the product. According to the seller's website, they only sell and produce high quality products. Unfortunately, I don't feel the bag is high quality product; especially the bag is not cheap. Don't buy it."
4,great product....untill i took it off!,"i used this cover for about 3 months and it worked amazing. i droped it soo many times and it didn't damage my nano at all!...but when ever i took it off my nano was soo dirty inside! i'm not sure if it was bc i had a clear protective skin on it or what but i messed it up pretty good!i do suggest you buy this product, just clean it often if you don't want it to mess your ipod up!"
4,Item fine - shipping slow.,"The first occasion I can recall Amazon letting me down! I had a definite deadline for receiving the product, and the streamlined system let me down. No complaints about the product, though - it is nice to be able to find more colors than the local Mac store carries in stock."
2,Past their brief peak,"Audience, at their best, have a hypnotic mid-tempo sound made almost opiate through Keith Gemmell's restrained saxophone. It found full bloom on their third album, House On The Hill. Lunch, their fourth, goes for a bigger sound with more musicians in the studio. The extra horns and backup singers don't make a better album, though and singer Howard Werth doesn't duplicate the full-throat commitment his singing had on previous songs such as Jackdaw. By this album, according to Wikipedia, the band was pretty much exhausted by non-stop touring and in the process of breaking up; this, their swan song, does indeed sound like a group at the end of their creative rope. Some of the old Audience musical tropes are there, but the album is a letdown."
4,Mostly plus,Everything works very well except just one item. The gas cylinder does not last very long. Five uses only.
5,Soo cool,Bought the Baby Q for my Dad and he LOVES it!! He uses it all of the time for camping and just for cooking the little stuff at home. It's small but not too small!! Also it is easy to clean. Dad recommends the attachment for the bigger tank. AWESOME
2,parts fit poorly,"I received the Q100 yesterday and immediately found a part fit problem. The holes in the cover and base for the hinge pins did not line up. This resulted in the cover remaining open by about 2 inches. I had to use a rat tail file to elongate the holes in the cover so it would completely close. I was also disappointed that the propane bottle normally used on portable gas grills (short and fat) would not fit. I had to make a special trip to a hardware store to purchase a tall thin one that is normally used for torches. The problem here is availability; the short fat ones are readily available at camping, sporting good and discount department stores where the tall skinny ones are not. The short fat ones are also considerably less expensive"
4,Empty Nester's Delight,Just the right size for a couple (or two.) Preheats quickly and cooks as well as the large one we used when all the kids were at home.
5,Great little grill,The baby Q heats up quickly and sears food fast. It is roomy enough for 8 pieces of chicken. Clean up is fairly easy. It's easy tote around and great for travel.
4,December 2007 - Still Works! Great!,"December, 2007. Still works GREAT. Love this grill, love Weber!I feel like writing an ode to Weber. Their products just last and last...3 years later, this little baby Q is still terrific. I'm going to follow other's advice and remove the tank adaptor and just use the larger ""camping"" style propane tanks. I have a 'big' Weber grill out back and it's still working too. Wish Weber made everything.....what a great company.(older review below....)Bought this primarily for our Cub Scout pack and has worked out very well. Sturdily made, easy to operate. As with all Weber products I've purchased in the past, quality is very high. Had for 4 months, not a problem yet. Yay, Weber!"
3,Weber Baby Q,"This is a good little grill, however it's occasionally difficult to start. Another problem is that it doesn't allow for larger (16 oz.) propane bottles. The smaller bottles are hard to find. I had to fabricate a new bracket out of a cloths hanger to accommodate the larger bottles. It was easy to do and works satisfactorily."
1,A Dangerous Occurance,"I purchased the Q 100 about eighteen months ago and have probably used it a total of 10 cooking hours. I use it only for outdoors picnics on land I own. I do like its size and many design features. However, and this is a big HOWEVER, this past weekend, after using the grill to prepare two meals, I unscrewed a Coleman propane cartridge from the grill, and brass regulator nozzle parts remained in the cartridge, sticking the cartridge valve open, and thus causing propane to violently spew from the cartridge. This was a dangerous situation because the brass parts could have then acted as a projectile, or the propane could have ignited and become a fire hazard."
2,Not good!,"Not good! It never heated above warm right out of the box. After three new 16.4 oz bottles and a couple of customer service snafus, turns out it needs a new regulator. Apparently the ""bad"" ones that ""were"" in circulation still are."
3,A pain to maintain,"I bought two of these babies based on all the favorable comments here, one for the RV and one for home. They seemed to be well built, and with a respected name like Weber I expected them to hold up better than the cheapies.Well, over time both of them develop uneven burner flame to the point that the flame peters out completely by the time it reaches 2/3 of the way around the burner tube, while burning extra hot near the front end. The problem is that the holes in the burner tube on the back side tend to rust partly closed and I have to ream them out with a bulletin-board push pin. Not fun and has to be done often.Keeping the grill clean is also more of a chore than with the cheapo chrome wire type."
4,Fine Grill,"I have had this grill several years now. I use it for camping. At the time I bought it, competitors either did not have open flame design (they were griddles masquerading as a bbq) or were significant larger and even heavier (e.g. they often include fold up legs).It is well made, and I have not had any problems whatsoever, and I am completely satisfied. I graded at 4 stars instead of 5 because of the relatively low heat level. Steaks can be seared after several minutes of initial warm up. I can not remember using any heat setting other than ""high.""One common complaint is that it uses 14 oz. propane cylinders. These are readily available in hardware stores in the section with soldering torches and supplies. (This was true even in a Ace Hardware store in Bishop, CA that sells the Baby Q!)"
5,Perfect!!,This grill is perfect to grill things for three of us. It is light enough that I can move it anywhere and it is a breeze to clean! I had the larger one and gave it to my brother's family as there are more of them! An excellent choice!
3,Solid Performer,"Took a bit of time to read the reviews on this grill, and it rated strongly across most consumers. The only conflict would be the smaller attachment for the mini lp tank. Most camping fuel uses a wider based canister. Easily replaced with a bent coat hanger... Not meant to be too portable though as it is quite heavy.Overall - starts easy, consistant heat and easy to clean. Quality construction you would expect from Weber."
1,Cannot use 16.4 oz bottles,"After reading here that newer versions of this grill can take both 14 and 16oz bottles, I bought a brand new one from Walmart yesterday. There is no way a 16oz bottle can fit without permanent modifications. Called Weber customer service, and all they could say was it should fit and I should push harder. Well with a 16oz bottle it's a good inch out of alignment, and if I forced it it would break. Even the user's manual says both bottle sizes should fit. It's a shame because it's an otherwise good quality looking grill. For $150 it should work as advertised without me forcing or modifying anything. Will be returning it."
1,Worthless,"I brought this grill last summer, based on the outstanding reviews. I've found it to be worthless. When it didn't work I went first to my local propane refill station to be sure the tank was OK. When it still didn't work I called the Weber customer service line and received outstanding response.. they sent me a complete replacement for the gas control. Got that and installed the new parts. Still doesn't work. I'm just going to write this off as a lost cause, set it out on the street for some hopeful pickup and go buy something else. Trust me.. it will NOT be another one of this loser.p.s I attempted to rate this piece of junk with zero stars but was obligated to give it one. Doesn't even deserve that."
5,Outstanding,I have owned a Baby Q for two years. Outstanding. We travel in our camper all over the US and it serves up great steaks wherever we are. Bought this one as a gift for my son who has always envied my grill.
4,Nothing beats a Weber!,"product arrived within a short span and is easy to use, operate and clean.Great for tail-gate parties. I did not get the optional ""table"" which may have made it easier to operate at a higher level and keep the grilling process(smoke) away from the vehicle. This unit has much more quality than other portable grills but the flip side of this quality is weight. Most men would not be bothered by this but less masculine types might find a heavy grill difficult to deal with."
5,Great grill,"Originally bought this as a temporary grill until I decided on a larger one. The results with this little grill were fantastic; easily kept food going for 8 people including burgers, kebabs, veggies, etc.Only drawback is the small tanks that everyone has mentioned already; don't want to use the 20lb tank but will see if I can bend the ring which only allows the 14 ounce tanks.BTW: liked the results so much and the portability factor that I have since decided not to get the bigger grill; this one does it all and the best part is that I can store it away once I'm done"
5,Portable Grill Like No Other,I purchased this grill about a week ago and am totally impressed. High enough heat to leave attractive grill marks on your meat. The cast iron cooking surface is easy to clean using the optional brass bristle brush. I plan on running it off of a 20# propane cylinder but so far have been using the 16 oz. cylinders. Like others I removed the bottom screw and enlarged the ring that holds the gas cylinders so that I could use the 16 oz. cylinders.Edit (10/26/08): My opinion of this grill has not changed. I liked it so much that I bought a larger one last year.
5,Oh! Baby,"I am a bbq failure and have been for years. I had given up. I've bought more bbqs than I can count. I thought I was too stupid to bbq.Tonight I used the Baby Q for the first time and it made me look like Bobby Flay on my first try out. It made the most perfectly cooked, grill marked, juicy hamburgers I ever tasted anywhere. And, it came off of my grill. I am blown away.The smokey flavor, the searing, the speed and ease of use is the best. Easy assembly and obvious quality construction. Yes, you can fit a lot of food on it and it all cooks perfectly no matter where it is on the grill. The flame comes up when the juices drip off but does not set the whole thing on fire. What a brilliant piece of engineering. I've waited my whole life for this one. Thanks Webber. You rock and rule the bbq kingdom. My hat is off to you."
2,Disappointed with my Baby Q,While this grill is well made and cooks fast it has thus far been impossible for me to figure out how to flame char the food I cook on it. Because of the design the fat drips down and vaporizes and the fumes from the vapors is supposed to flavor the meat. In practice this is not sufficient to get the flavor I like as I want to be able to flame char the meat for a short time and due to the inherent design of this BBQ it has thus far proven impossible to do.
1,Weber does not warranty their grills!,"I have always held Weber to a certain standard that included their product and customer service until the first and last time I had to deal with their customer service.Here is my story:I had a party the other day where I grilled up eight amazing rib eyes. Unfortunately the fat from the steaks left a lot of residue onWeber 386002 Q-100 Portable Gas Grillthe grill and in the grease pan. When I was done grilling I turned off the propane and allowed the grease to burn off the grill when it continued to burn and then before i knew it the grill was on fire. Never experiencing this before, I called up Weber and said that 3 years after my purchase the grill does not warranty grease fire damage (strange for a bbq?). Their best solution was for me to buy a grill from them at cost, which is roughly the cost at amazon.Needless to say I will never buy a Q bbq again and I have regrets on buying my other Weber genesis. Maybe this is the time to go to charcoal exclusively."
5,Best little grill!,"This grill is amazing. There is so much surface space on this little thing. The grill itself is well constructed and made of very solid, sturdy parts. It heats really well and keeps heat well since the metal is so thick. Definitely the best bang for your buck."
5,Weber,Weber grill was received in a timely manner. Comparing it to the same grill available in the community great value. Performing exactly as expected. Well constructed. Quality product.
5,Perfect Grill,"Odd - there used to be hundreds of excellent reviews for this product, which are gone. For those looking for more reviews, just look at the Weber Q 200, which is a larger version of this grill.Well, here's my short review: this is a fantastic grill. I live in a New York City apartment with a small balcony, so I needed something small that didn't heat the surroundings too much, yet was hassle free and grilled a great meal. This produces enough heat to cook steaks perfectly yet remains cool so you're not broiling your table, windows, etc. There's nothing this grill lacks, and I can't say I miss having a larger, non-portable grill. The surface area is enough to grill for 2-3 people at a time. This is also incomparable to the cheap portable grills, which are smaller, flimsy, require an external lighter, unstable, and heat massively (while providing little cooking heat). If you're considering one of those grills, definitely get this instead."
1,Did not work - Manf Defect,"How hard is it to make a toilet lever? Must be hard. This handle has a defect where it sticks after flushing, if you don't push it up the toilet will run for hours. I won't buy another Danco product. Wife bought this online, did not return it in time so this thing has to go in the trash, good bye $15. Also wasted 2 months messing with this dumb thing. No more Danco products for my house. Note - Defect is in the handle itself, gets stuck, not a rod or chain issue."
4,I'm flushed now!,"This product is proof that cheap plastic levers are not worth your time - solid, easy to assemble and aesthetically pleasing. And it is not likely to collapse due to low quality engineering & materials in <1year... why buy 5 krappy plastic ones when this is available. You have to ask yourself this - what would Thomas Krapper have used on his design... a Danco style lever for sure!!"
3,Well made but IT DOES NOT WORK FOR SIDE MOUNT,Nice solid material and lots of adjustments but after an hour I cannot get it to work on my side mount application.
3,Okay but...,"This lever was supposed to be ""Universal."" I bought it for a side mount toilet, but could not get it to operate properly. I also had a plumber take a look at it when he was in on another project and he couldn't get it to work either. I ended up using it on another toilet. It is solidly built and works fine on a front mount tank."
4,"High quality, but some ""fit"" problems","This is a well-made & sturdy product. I've installed them in different finishes on 3 of my 4 toilets at home & they look & function great! Why not all four, you ask? For the same reason some other reviewers have been frustrated...difficult if not impossible to adapt to side flush lever toilets. That about says it all. Other than that problem, I'd give it 5 stars plus! BTW, if you're not sure about this lever & want to see it in person, my Home Depot carries it in a wide variety of finishes for about the same price."
1,too frustrating,"This item came to my 4 year old who is quite developed in terms of hand manipulation. The screws and tools however, did not screw easily. He understood the directions but could not get the parts together. Not even I could use the screws and tools.He became very frustrated and it was no fun at all."
4,My Son Loves this Toy,My 4 year old son loves this toy. The tools and screws are easy for him (and me) to use but he needs help following the directions since the images can be a little confusing for him to follow. The bucket it comes in is nice and big... no trouble fitting everything in which is great for clean up.
2,Bad tools,"Could have been really great, except the screwdriver is terribly difficult to use, which means my 4-year-old son can't really work on it by himself."
1,Was it A Waste of Time?,"I have been a Trekker since the beginning. I have always liked Star Trek in all it's incarnations. I have read everything I could about the stars, the shows, and the creator -- Gene Roddenberry. I am about half way through this book by Joel Engel. I have read other Roddenberry biographies. This one I could have done without. It appears to be biased and sort of a witch hunt. In an effort to make sales, the author appears to look and find everything bad he can about Roddenberry. I can only assume that this approach seemed to have some merit with Mr. Engel. I can not with good conscience reccomend this book to other Star Trek fans. It would tarnish the Great Bird of the Galaxy's reputation too much."
4,Worked for me!,"I used this book in conjunction with Exam Cram and found it more thorough, as well as more understandable. I got an excellent score on the test and purchased more books in this series."
3,"Great toy, but no instructions.","My boys are very excited to try this out. Their uncles were pleased to see that this is very much like the erector sets of the 60's, with actual bolts, metal parts, etc. However, the lack of instructions will make this a challenging project, requiring more adult assistance than we had hoped."
4,Effective Teaching Tool,"Any teacher may find this book useful for teaching early American history because of the actual historical maps available. The book may work to integrate math and social studies. For English Language Learners, practice in the native language--if Spanish--may facilitate the process of helping students learn the principles that may be assessed. For example, the teacher may select a page from the book and ask questions such as: What is a word that has more than one meaning? Is there a word that you do not know in the selected segment, and if so, can you guess at the meaning based on the sentence or paragraph? Find a word on the page and give a synonym. Find another word and give an antonym. This book may be a good book to practice understanding directions."
2,not as good as the book,"You are better off spending your money on the book, which is excellent. The DVD is too short for the money. In addition it gives only a cursory introduction to the material. In the book, the author goes into much greater detail and outlines the methods to work his principles into your daily life."
2,ksa,"HelloCompany CloverVery impressive and already bought a lot of the products I'm a fan of this companyUnfortunately, this product My hope is disappointedColors does not look clear on the Fabric"
2,What's the fuss?,"I have used these pens for a year now, and frankly, they are quite worthless. Here's a quick sum up:Pros- work relatively well on regular cotton fabricCons- break easily when sharpened- they wear very quickly when marking fabric; expect to sharpen them every few pattern pieces that you trace/mark- because of the softness of the tip, they don't stay sharp for long, thus making VERY broad lines- they are not ideal to use with a ruler, see previous point- do not work on stretch fabric as you have to push down fairly hard to mark the fabric, which in turn stretches/distorts the fabricWhile the idea is great, I get much better results using a regular pencil on non-stretch fabric and a pencil costs 1/10 of these."
1,Too hard,The chalk in the pencils is very hard. It doesn't mark well enough to see. I wasn't happy with the product and will not purchase more in the future.
3,"Mostly happy, but...","I'd hoped that the blue would have been a little darker, or that in a combo pack there would be a darker color to provide more contrast on lighter fabrics.I found they work best when used on fabric that is warmed from ironing, but using a little pressure on room temperature fabrics works. While the marks are visible, sometimes they 'disappear' under the presser foot and the light of the sewing machine.Overall, they do what they are intended to do, but it would be nice to have a little tip sharpener in the caps."
1,Crap,"If I could, I would have given these pencils a score of 0. Despite of negative reviews, I decided to try these out. Boy oh boy, do these do not work. In order to mark something, you would have to press hard to see some lines, but the led will break!"
1,Terrible quality,"Other reviewers had good luck with these, but I unfortunately did not. I found it far inferior to another water-soluble pencil I had. These are extremely soft and impossible to get a point on. You end up drawing a fat line, which is not very helpful. But worse than that was the sharpening; every time I did, no matter how carefully or how fat I left the point, it snapped. I marked 40 or so 4x4 squares and used up an entire pencil just because the tips kept snapping off. I didn't think the marks left were clear either. On the whole, I much prefer other brands I've tried."
3,Just ok,"The marks don't really last, I would not use them for marking detailed designs or for anything that you need the markings to last for any length of time. On red fabric none of the colors showed up real well. I do think for smaller projects and markings that aren't needed to be exact they would suffice."
1,Useless,"As with all other John Patrick books, this one is useless garbage. He tells you how to lose less, which you MIGHT do if you follow his methods---but you'll still lose. Couldn't you lose without reading this poorly written junk?"
1,Terrible product. Do not buy,"I bought this product for my car thinking it would be a cool deck and would be different from any other ordinary deck and i was right. I thought it was really cool and so did my friends, the display graphics where a little old but I could deal with that.It worked great for about 3 or so months and then the display started to flicker and eventually the display went out completely and my music would stop playing when I opened up the screen. I sent it in and they sent me back a refurbished one and it worked fine so i was happy again. then about a month or 2 later the same exact thing happened. Display went to black and music shut off and I was unable to use the touch screen. (the whole reason I bought the stupid thing..)My advice is to find something better, perhaps a double din. Not worth the $230 some dollars I paid for it. really unsatisfied with this product."
3,Dual Stereo Screen Quit Working in 5 days,"I purchased this Dual stereo with screen from Amazon and had Best Buy's Geek Squad install it for me. Because of the screen, it cost $100 to install. 5 days later the screen wouldn't open/close. I called Dual who suggested I send back the unit. Amazon was great to work with and re-sent a new stereo out right away. The problem is that I'm out the $100 installation cost because the stereo malfunctioned. I called Dual to ask about the cost of installation and he wouldn't even discuss with me, just said that it's not covered under warranty. I suppose I should have used the stereo for a year before I installed it in my car just to be sure that their product actually works. Now I have to sit at Best Buy for another whole day and wait, and then pay for the installation again. Dual was not easy to work with and would not recommend buying a stereo from them unless you can install it for free."
2,"Cheap, broke","This lasted me for a week. Then it broke. Cheap product, very thin. I wanted a thicker ring that will hold my keys but this was very flimsy."
4,Good,"Good keyholder for small, thin keys .. I purchased this for my spare car key... too small ... perfect for my house key when I'm on the go :)"
5,Organization Plus for Keys,"This item is the best for organizing keys - easy to assemble and set up name tab for the keys. Compared to the hanging boxes, this is economical, space saver and easy access to obtain keys."
5,A great CD,I have loved Robson and Jerome ever since I lived in the UK back in the early 90s. They were one of the most popular recording artists in the UK and Europe then. Robson went on to become one of Britian's most accomplished Actors in film and TV. Terrific duo and the music wonderful Buy it!!
5,As much evidence as you ca find,"If you liked the ""Voice of Evidence"" IEEE Software articles, then you will love the entire book.This book should really be the SWEBok. This is, it tells the reader in a very succinct way how much do we know about software engineering.The references are also incredibly good, although sometimes a bit old :)"
3,Fluffy/padded,"Alas, despite the great reviews, I didn't find this book useful or inspiring. It seemed fluffy/padded. It was hard to plod to the end of it.Read a sample chapter before you buy."
5,Maybe the most important book you will ever read,"Once again, Glass has proven that he belongs in the software engineering pantheon along with Tom DeMarco, Gerry Weinberg, and Steve McConnell.This book will open your eyes. If you work in the field, you'll never think about your livelihood the same way again.If you take only one thing away from this book, remember this: don't blindly trust what the advocates of the latest methodology are saying, whether it be OO, XP, RUP, or UML, without some substantive evaluative research backing them up. Glass makes compelling arguments as to why the software industry has fallen easy prey to the hucksters and snake-oil salesmen."
4,Much Better with a glass of wine,"Well, I sort of like this movie. Especially the last segment with Margot Kidder. Sure it is a little hoky at times, but it is still as good or better than 97% of what you will see on TV tonight. It's not a big budget project, despite the big names. Don't expect ALIENS or GHOST BUSTERS, delight in the thought, ""Hey I could have done that if I'd just get away from E-Bay and Amazon all the time!"" Compared to what I've seen on American Idol this season, this is an A+++ effort!"
1,got only 5 when ordered 6 . 2 boxes leaking and appears to be filled with something else.,odered 6 got 5. Two boxes leaking and appears to be filled with some other kind of cocoa. Would not use this vendor again. No packing slip.
4,REAL Holland,The Droste cocoa Product was shipped promptly and promptly gave me a surprise. It was Droste - Direct from Holland!With Dutch printing and all of the European signs of an imported item.None of the website info. or photos gave any indication of this reality.I have NOT used the product yet.
1,I wanted to love it based on the hype ...,"... unfortunately, I was totally disappointed when using Droste. I looked high and low for it too, and paid $8/box thinking I would have an outstanding product. The finished 14"" square X 4"" high layer cake was very moist, but lacked the darker and richer chocolate expectations both in color and taste. In addition, it also allowed for the cinnamon taste to lean forward - which under the previous chocolate used, was considerably the faint surprise that flavor was meant to be. Droste may be wonderful for making devil's food, but did not hold up for the darker, richer chocolate that I was hoping for. I was very disappointed considering all the hype. But, I truly appreciate these posts. They are a source of helpful input, inspiration, and the kindliness of sharing one's experience. I appreciate all the information especially the comparisons to other cocoa powders."
3,Good and Bad,"I recall using Droste's cocoa powder for making easy and delicious hot chocolate as far back as 1956. I dearly loved it then. After not using it for several decades I recently purchased several boxes on Amazon.com, mainly for nostalgic reasons.It's quality still seemed excellent. It was delicous and easy to make.But I was appalled--just now my wife brought me a large mug of Droste's hot chocolate--[A LONG DELICIOUS PAUSE] I was appalled that the powder came in a poorly sealed box, and not in a sealed bag or in a sealed container. The powder seeps through the cracks in the box, and it is a mess to handle or to store. I gave one box as a gift and had to enclose the box in a sealed plastic bag before gift-wrapping it! The Droste factory could do better.Product is a 5. Packaging is a 1. Therefore I rate the experience as a 3."
2,Chalky Taste,"I keep wishing I could love this cocoa, but I'm overwhelmed by it's chalky taste. I know others here feel very strongly for this cocoa and will disagree with me, but, following a hot cocoa recipe almost to the ""T,"" I have consistently made the worst cups of hot chocolate of my life! I'm about to throw this cocoa out. My only hope is that it tastes better in baking, and perhaps my sister, the baker in the family can use it."
3,NOT SO CREAMY,I found this a little bitter and a little thin. I guess I have a childhood memory of cocoa I'm trying to recreate. This isn't it.
4,"Great product, poor shipping","I love to use this is my baking and this is the best price that I've found for it. The quality is vastly superior to any supermarket brand. The only complain that I have is that when it was sent to me, the box was smashed open. The plastic bag containing the cocoa was still intact but I was very disappointed to see that it was damaged and I was surprised that it was only sent to me in a padded envelope, not a box."
1,Disappointed! I got the Jelly even though it clearly states whole granules. The packaging is also different.,"I got the Jelly; even though, it clearly states whole granules. The packaging is also different. Can't send it back since I opened the item. Very disappointed!"
4,Short and interesting,"In this short work, Feiler reviews the Biblical story of Abraham and then describes how the myth of Abraham has changed over time and between the Abrahamic religions. It is well-written and interesting, and its length is well-suited for the amount of information Feiler wishes to convey. (There were no lengthy speculations in order to add bulk!) I enjoyed it and learned a little bit, too!"
5,Fits perfect on 2002 s10,Fits perfect on 2002 s10 and easy to install. Looks great and will help with fading. Colors match fabric in Truck.
2,Not as good as they use to be.,"I have bitten these dash covers in the past and the quality has gone downhill, I could of gotten one else where that would of been better."
1,Princeton Review - Inside the SAT/ACT 2002 Deluxe Software,"The Princeton Review ""Inside the the SAT & ACT 2002 Deluxe"" CD software damaged my computer's operating system (Windows 95) and required more than 6 hrs of repair time by a highly qualified PC technician. A complete re-imaging of my hard drive was required to restore full operation. This is the worst software I have ever encountered. Technical support from the manufacturer -The Learning Company was completely lacking and I never received a reply to a long distance toll call I made at my expense to their support center."
2,Windows 2000 users beware!,The SAT CD works but the ACT program will not load if you are using Windows 2000.
3,Not Portable,"The pictures in this tabletop book are nice, but I was looking for something to take with me on a trip to Scotland."
1,DEAD after a couple days,"I used this thumbdrive w/ my desktop, no poblem. Pluged it into my laptop nothing other than suggestions to format. I checked it back on my desktop still ok. Both are running xp SP2, long story shortened, I finaly hit ok on the format option as Imation says is no problem, it nevers complete the format, on ether machine nor can it be read."
1,"DON'T BUY - low quality, incompatible with other Melissa & Doug sets","Poorly built and disappointing, a waste of money. The screws chip and erode very easily during use, due to the low quality of the wood. Some of the screw lengths are insufficeint for buiding the toys shown in the diagrams. The set is INCOMPATIBLE with other Melissa & Doug wooden constructino sets (e.g. the Wood Take-Alonmg 24 Piece Tool Kit). Worse yet, the set is a let-down for kids of any age: young ones (5+) won't touch it, older ones (9+) will try to use it, only to give up in frustration."
2,"Good idea, bad paint job.",I bought this toy becase the idea is excellent for educational value and the child I got it for was excited to build the helecoptor and the crane shown in the instruction sheet included; BUT the toy is POORLY CONSTRUCTED!!! The paint is inside the threading of the nuts and prevents the bolts from screwing into them and damages the bolts. I had a previous version of the Melissa & Doug construction set which came with a box that folded out to a workbench stand and the nuts were not painted inside the threading and the bolts screwed in just fine. That version couldn't made three-dimentional objects. This version has blocks with holes in all sides to allow three-dimeintional building - that is great. The wooden bolts for my earlier version are fairly durable but the edges will chip easily. The two versions are not compatible. The makers just have to get the pain job right and the toy would be good.
1,Screws have too much manufacturing variability and are too short.,"The screws are sometimes not quite long enough to construct the desired projects. 3 of my 16 screws have manufacturing defects (length, taper) that make them unusable. It's very hard to distinguish blue and green screws on the enclosed diagram. The wooden screws are very hard to turn and the screwdriver (only 1/3 the width of the screw head) is impossible to use. Aligning 3 or 4 items and then inserting a difficult-to-turn screw is challenging for me even as an adult. This is far more difficult to assemble than Ikea furniture.Melissa and Doug has some good toy concepts, but this one is a failure, due to poor manufacturing execution."
2,Incompatible and hard to use,"My son got this as a gift. Many of the pieces are chipped, one is full on cracked and i am considering containing the company about it. The screws are hard to turn. The screws are a bit thinner than the ones in the M&D toolbox so not compatible. Bummer."
3,mixed bag,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitnessOverall, I think the negative outweighed the positive for me but I would recommend this to beginning exercisers.pros: Worked up a mild sweat with chapter 4 which was tough.cons: The rest of the routines were just a little too easy for me. The standing routine didn't even make me break a sweat. Overall, though, I am guessing these would be great low impact routines for beginners. The deciding factor that made me not want to keep this video was the constant, closeup stomach shots of the instructor --- I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was to make you focus on squeezing your own ab muscles but instead I just found it really annoying."
5,I am seeing results!,"I love this dvd! It is very convenient and a time saver. There are 5 workouts that you can choose from. I save a lot of time in the mornings by putting this dvd on and doing a quick workout.I have been doing this dvd every morning for a month. I am already starting to see results. My clothes are fitting looser and I am losing inches around my waist.The fact that these workouts are 10 minutes is great. I can do one or two in the morning and one or two at night. Even though the workouts are 10 minutes, you will definitely feel the burn!! These are great workouts."
4,Nice addition to my routine,"I have three 10 Minute Solution DVDs and this one is the best. It is my favorite because I really feel like I have worked my abs after completing just one workout. With the other DVDs, I have to complete several of the workouts to feel like I have really worked out. However, on this DVD each ab workout is very effective. The instructor cues well and paces the routine so that you get the most out of your 10 minutes. There are some new ab moves here that are excellent for ""shocking"" your muscles. If you are like me and have been working out for many years, you know how important variety is for maintaining definition, especially as we age. Overall, these workouts are quite effective and a nice addition to a toning workout routine or as a follow up to a cardio routine. They can also be used as a workout ""snack"" when you are pressed for time. I use them when I travel as well."
2,EXPECTED BETTER,"I love the 10 minute DVD exercise series. So I bought this one with a few others to get into shape. This was a good exercise, but the DVD consisted of mainly different kinds of general exercise moves (sit ups, leg raises, etc.) that we have all done and tired. I re-sold it as I know how to do sit ups and such."
4,It is an excellent workout,"I've been taking karate classes (I'm 39 years old) for a couple of years. I also do cardio/ kickboxing classes. This DVD is so helpful to strengthen my core. When your core is stronger - it's easier to practice martial arts because you feel balanced. I fall over less when kicking high and dashing forward to punch or spinning around and kicking behind me. Also, when your core is stronger - you have less back problems! Love it. Thank you 10 minute solution: Blast Off Belly Fat!"
3,OK,This video wasn't really what I was looking for. I personally couldn't really get into it. I may be more of a cardio person (turbo jam abs).
2,Disappointed,I'm in fairly decent shape and found these exercises to be too advanced. The instructor only occasionally offers alternative positions for beginners. My back hurt after 3 minutes. There should be alternates for all levels.
3,"10 minute solutions, blast off belly fat","I like that you can combine 10 minute segments to create your own workout. I was hoping this would be to upbeat music, but not so much."
2,Good for beginners only,The video was not at all challenging for someone who works out on a regular basis. Waste of money for anyone other than someone just starting out.
2,Fun but does it work?,"I have to agree with one other reviewer, this instructor does have an ironically huge belly, especially apparent when she is doing exercises on all fours.This makes me question whether the flab is there because of her workout or in spite of it.Sure some of the moves are great. But I can't get my eyes off of the flab."
5,A different way to blast abs,"I love this DVD it hits my abs from a totally different way than convention exercises, and it is fun!!!"
3,great for beginner-intermediate level,"There are several 10 minute ab routines. Some are easy, others more challenging. If you are at an advanced level of fitness, this will likely not be hard enough unless you do the whole video."
2,Annoying,I bought this because of the great reviews. The instructor is annoying and too fast. I could watch her past the first ten minutes.
1,Disappointed,This is mere rubbish. I decided to try this out because i needed to work on my abs. The moves are too fast and the Instructor is boring. I regret buying this cd.
2,too difficult for injured body,"I'm 48, had neck surgery in 2007, have a bad back and bursitis in my right hip. Even with my disabilities, I'm in fairly decent shape but this DVD is too difficult for me to use. This DVD is better suited for people with no injuries or inflammation in their hip and neck."
5,Good Video with Variety,"After reading several reviews I selected this video and have been quite pleased with it. First, there's 5 seperate segments. You can do just one or you can arrange the segments into any order to create a customized workout. Second, the exercizes are challenging and can be modified from beginer to advanced. Next, the instructor is pleasant without being annoying. There's only 1 person to watch, not a bunch of others in the background. I've been using the video for a month now and I have not gotten bored, which is usally what happens."
4,It's hard to do!,"I am fairly fit but found this DVD to be a real challenge. I think it's amazing, however! If you have never done any ab work (or fairly limited ab work), then you should look for something easier to do."
4,Good,"These are awesome if you only have a few minutes a day to workout. For the most part you can just do these workouts in your living room even if its kind of small. Some things could use a little more room, though, and its nice that you don't have to have a whole bunch of props."
1,Don't waste your money!,I own five workout DVDs and most of them are easy to follow. This workout DVD is not created for the beginners or people like me who have been working out everyday for the past years! Just working through the whole tape I thought that I was in the army training section!
3,wrong dvd,"I ordered this dvd but recieved a different dvd in the mail, the one i received is a pilates workout but not the one i ordered."
1,poor poor poor video,"not worth a dime!!! dont even bother buying this video, waste of time! i donated it after using it once."
3,Video and Shipment,"The video is ok, I thought it would have more abs exercises on the ground. They shipped me the video twice and charged me twice."
1,Why should I watch her?,"I'm sure the exercises on this video are every bit as good as other customers say they are. I couldn't get past the mound of flesh hanging from the instructor's stomach when she was demonstrating in the push-up position. How in the world is she going to show me how to flatten my abs when she can't even flatten her own? This video reminded of something a friend of mine once said: You don't ask a homeless person how to obtain and maintain wealth. Granted, I didn't finish the video once I noticed her belly fat. I just don't allow people who aren't doing for themselves to attempt to show me what to do. In my mind, it obviously doesn't work because it hasn't worked for her."
1,ONLY FOR ADVANCED PEOPLE,"I asumed that the instuctor would explain all the moves, and do a play by play on all the exercises, but instead she talks very fast, and moves very fast, as if you are an expert already yourself, so you get lost pretty quickly, this DVD is for advaced people that already have all the moves down, if yuor a beginer, starting out, she talks and moves so fast your just lost"
5,great video,"I used to have the 8 minutes abs etc. type of tapes. This one is just the best out of all of them. Easy to follow, great choices. Just love it !!!"
2,I felt nothing with this DVD,"Either I have incredibly strong abs or this video isn't that great. I did all of the segments in a row, finally stopping about 5 minutes before the end of the last segment in disgust at the lack of any burn I felt. I did feel some burn doing the endless bicycle repetitions, but upon completing these workouts, I don't have any soreness and felt next to nothing during the workout and feel absolutely nothing afterward.If you are at an intermediate or advanced level, I really don't recommend this."
4,Great Variety!,"I have been very pleased with this workout. there are 5, 10 minute sections and each is a different type of routine so its very hard to get bored of any section! Some days I will do a cardio routine and then just one 10 minute section afterwards, and on toning days i'll do 2 sections and other exercises! You will see results, just remember complement the workouts with cardio and a balanced diet (sure I sound like a broken record but many people just look for a miracle cure and there just isn't one!) I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do!"
5,She kicked by bum!,"Every woman worries about her abs. When I saw this video I was like ""10 minutes? yeah right!"" Well, I was correct! You can't just do one 10 minute ab workout and expect to see results! Luckily there are five 10 minute work outs on this DVD! They get increasingly more challenging and are never boring! The lady in the video is very pretty and keeps you motivated! She tells you how to do each exercise and makes it easy to follow. I did the entire DVD as soon as it arrived in the mail. My abs were so swore I couldn't work out again for three days! Which I was glad of because that tells me its working. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,Excellent,Very good and effective abs routines to make in short time. I use it to complement my cardio routine and has been very effective.
5,fast and efficient,These are great ab workouts. I workout regularly but I still get a great ab burn in just 10 minutes. I put it in alone or after a workout for extra ab toning. Love it!
2,A formulaic attempt at capturing the magic of the original,"I eagerly anticipated this sequel. Unfortunately it is merely a formulaic attempt to duplicate the original in a different setting. Roy Bash is to goes through the same ups and downs, corrupting cynical attitudes, and, finally, redemtion. The ""mentor"" figure is a duplicate of the HOG's ""fatman"". It is as if Roy didn't learn anything at the HOG, thus we are sentenced to watch him live through the exact same story again. When will the cycle end? I stopped reading this book when it became clear that it was going to harm my relationship with the original. Good-twin vs bad-twin syndrome?"
2,Mt. Misery-miserable!,"As an R.N. who spent 3 months in a Siate Psychiatric Hospital (not as a Patient), I have one word for this book-- miserable!"
2,This guy can't write characters,"Aside from not being all that funny, the big problem with this book is that -- except for the narrator -- the characters are uniformly unidimensional and not particularly believable. This is death for a novel, and this one obliges by dying early on. The main character is interesting enough to keep you interested for maybe the first 250 pages, but no more."
4,"So accurate, it's scary!!!","I am a Psychiatric R.N. at a county hospital. The situations and profiles of the M.D.'s and other staff in this book are very real. The only difference is the book is set in a private hospital. The county hospital setting is even MORE dysfunctional!!!! I loved the book, and am going to read House of God again, too."
3,Not very original...,"After reading ""House of God"", I've decided to try the sequel, and was VERY disappointed - it seemed to have the same jokes, the same struggles, etc. On top of that I felt that even though the book was set a little over a year after ""House of God"", was written about an Era quite a whle later..."
5,loved it!,"I am a counselor and I appreciated the honesty, grit, and peek into the psychiatric world. I found a lot of truth in the book and got a great deal out of reading it."
1,Thoughtless drivel,"The House of God was a thoughtful, inspired cutting and usually dark satire of the medical world.Mount Misery is a good description of trying to read this book. It has the feel of one of those [inexpensive] knock-off movies or television shows where one person comes up with a brilliant concept and someone tries to duplicate it, fails and ultimately makes it much much worse.It scares me that such a misanthropic person is a psychiatrist and that he can see the world so myopically as to think that a book like this would create anything but fodder for bad reviews.... if you are interested in writing about psychiatry read Kay Redfield Jameson or patient perspective books--Sylvia Plath, even Kaysen. ..."
5,provocative yet accurate,"Samuel Shem's sequel to his best selling novel ""The House of God"" provides the raw reality of today's training of psychiatry residents which for those not in the healthcare business does indeed read like a novel but to those who have undergone psychiatric training it reads more like a documentary. One concern I had was that although the sequel is supposed to be taking place two years after the original novel, in reality the difference in historical timing is close to twenty because the original novel took place during Nixon's second term and the sequel makes references to president clinton and other healthcare issues which simply were not issues two years after the original novel took place. Other than that, fans of the first book will not be disappointed"
1,IF YOU LOVED HOUSE OF GOD....READ IT AGAIN!,"Yikes, I just can't believe anyone liked this book. First, I absolutely loved the House of God! It was an excellent book, and I really couldn't wait to run out and read the sequel. Unfortunately, Mount Misery is absolutely nothing like the HOG. It was actually a struggle to get through the book, and I had to suffer just to finish it. I know this will be hard to believe if you just finished HOG, but MM is really nothing like it! It is slow, dark, and lacks all the humor/morbid satire and huge issues HOG dealt with. Shem should have never wrote this book, it really disappoints as some of the other reviewers pointed out. Just plain don't waste your time on this one, instead reread HOG! I'm sure you won't believe me, but you will see if you try to read this one."
3,I've read worse and I've read better in the genre.,"... This novel is not nearly as funny as the first book and raises very few questions other than the trite ""Who would want to be a Resident?"" question answered much better in Shem's first book.This book also concentrates almost solely on esoteric abnormal psychology and is hard to relate to. I'm a family practice physician who did quite a few psych rotations in school and residency and I still don't quite relate to this book and its content.However, Shem still is the master of describing medical malcontents masquerading as compassionate physicians. And the book was worth reading for that reason even though it wasn't as entertaining as House of God."
3,Shark Toy,"When I received the package, I was surprised how small the toy was. I should have paid more attention to the measurements. The pictures make the shark look so big. My son still plays with this shark, but he loves the larger one I bought him."
2,Printmaster Greeting Cards,Thought the cards would be like Broderbund's American Gretings Creatacard Platinum 8 software but it was not and I did not like what I got.
3,"Days of our Lives"" in Print","This is a wild weekend book. It is a great spicy read that is easy to pick up and you'll hate to put down.The book set in Hawaii, will remind you of the Islands,if you have ever known them, and make you want to go there if you have not been.The characters will spin you into their steamy web. You may think you know some of them or be convinced that nobody lives this kind of life. Either way there are some tittleating moments and at the same time nothing too serious going on."
2,Packaging Obviously Lacking,"This was a replacement item for a broken one also received from an Amazon vendor. This one was also broken when received. I don't know if it was broken in handling or shipping but I did not bother to try a third time. I had an identical light that was dropped and broken and I was buying this to replace it. The light is cool looking when it works, but obviously very fragile. It needs better packaging in addition to the manufacturer's packaging than was provided by Amazon fulfillment. The lights were never even removed from the box. I opened the box and there was broken glass all insided.I guess this is an item I will need to find locally so I can inspect it before leaving the store and at least start with one that is all in one piece."
5,A KNIGHT FOREVER!,I loved this book. I thought it wouldn't end happily. I was worried there for a minute. It was a great romance novel. I truly enjoyed this read and you will to.
4,A great writer in the making,"First, let me start off by saying that I loved the concept of this book. Aaliyah's writings remind me of my own and I couldn't put the book down.But, I do wish that mrs. burke had sprung for a good editor. The fluidity could have givien this book the extra edge that it needed. however, she did keep the action coming and the love between kit and marcus hot.And may I just say that Kit unnerved me for a large portion of the book. i didn't see her as strong, I saw her as overbearing. If it was midevil times, Marcus would have killed her after the first night. I wish that she could have been a lot softer. if only for marcus's sake.Either way, I gave this book 4 stars. With editing and an attitude adjustment for kit, it could have been 5."
2,Too Much of a Good Thing,"I don't want to beat a dead horse, but the grammatical errors and odd point-of-view shifts were so abundant in this book I almost put it down more than once. But since its an IR romance I pulled through.Unfortunately the book really doesn't get any better. The author made the heroine darn near perfect (multilingual, martial arts expert, blah blah blah). So much so why did she even need the hero? And why did I need to care about her?But then we were left hanging by the hero. His attraction to the heroine didn't seem all that defined. Of course she was different than anything he'd ever seen before but I didn't understand why he fell in love with her other than the fact that she was perfect.Considered how thick this book was there wasn't really any plot or conflict. And I felt left hanging on how the hero came forward in time."
5,Exceptional Read,After seeing this book on a few BW/WM sites I decided to track down a copy to see if it lived up to the hype of a good read. I have to admit that I was not at all disappointed. Unlike some stories where I am left often hating the heroine and questioning why the two lead characters got together...........I was so enthralled with both Kit and Marcus from page 1.....So much so I read the whole book in one day. It was so nice to get to read a strong woman and a strong man in the story that recognize what they had was special.
3,Good Idea but......,"Good Idea and the concept is great but it was executed horribly. First, who ever edited this book should get a new job because there were way too many errors and inconsistencies. As an avid reader these errors take away from the story and makes it harder to read. I also believe it would have been more appealing if the characters spoke in old English while in England, also the plots time line was not consistent. Overall, there are a lot more problems with the book but I do commend the writer for having the courage to write her first book. I would suggest this book to anyone who just wants to read a book but it is lacking lots of substance that would make it a good book."
5,WHAT A RARE TREAT!!,"Hold on to your hats folks--there's a new historical voice that's come to town. It's an interracial time travel. A rarity indeed! I was completely enthralled by this book and enjoyed it immensely. The time travel aspect and the time periods covered (from 21st century to the 12th century England) was something new and daring. A most definite plus IMO! I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the heroine is a very strong, intelligent black woman, who is more than a match for the strong Alpha male hero. The heroine's color, manner of dress and demeanor were all issues, in particular, that obviously had to be addressed in the book. These issues and others that were specifically relevant to 12 century England were skillfully dealt without ever overwhelming the story or bogging it down never-ending minutia.I want to see much, much more from this very promising writer. Much deserved Congrats on your debut!!!!"
1,This book was very very bad,"This book was a complete waste of time. The writing and editing are horrible. I could barely stand to finish it, but I did because I paid good money for this book. The writing and characters speech was inconsistent and very unbelievable. She had the characters from hundreds of years ago talking like they would today, but originally they didn't speak like that. If I could go back in time I would have never read this book."
2,what time was she writing about?,A black woman somehow finds herself in 11th century.she is strong will and stands up for herself so much so that men of the days of knights and servant fall at her feet and obey her orders.Marcus nick named the devil for being one of the kings fierces warrior is struck dumb and allow this strange woman to rule over his home.walking around in skin tight pants and doing as she pleases.the lack of proper dialog shocks you out of sloppy writen story.The failuar to really make a promising story come to life. Charators come in an fade out with the failure to let their story play righ along .The pathic close of the story wraped in the last 20 pages left many unanswered questions. The fact that the writer could not keep her time lines together sad.This was like watching that harrible child musical that you are force to sit thru is wath case me to read the whole book when i should have just burned it so no one would be force to sit thur the deaf tone writing.
3,Okay,This book was an okay read it had potential to be much better. There was a lot of grammatical errors and I noticed some of the words Marcus used were not that of someone speaking in the 12th century. I also didn't like that there were no numbers telling you what chapter you were reading. My book marker fell out and I had a heck of a time locating the page. I liked Kit's character for the most part but I think the author went overboard with what this women could do. I thought I was reading about Wonder Woman and Marcus stayed in a jealous state throughout the entire book. Not the best book I've ever read but certainly no the worst.
3,Pretty Coffee Table Book,"I have read Charlotte's book, ""Creating A Room"", and prefer it while re-decorating. ""A Passion for Detail"" is a ""look book"" and sometimes a little too precious for the average household. But it is nice escapism"
1,Marshal Zhukov,"A facinating subject for a biography, I bought it with enthusiasm and dived straight in the day it arrived. Sadly this book was a considerable disappointment. Thin and lacking in detail, but surely most surprisingly discussion of Zukovs greatest battles and tactics are almost completely absent.For example the 'chapter' dedicated to the tank battle at Kursk, the most important tank battle of WWII, totals a mere 7 pages, five discuss the set up for the battle, and two discuss the aftermath. Details about the actual battle are completely ommitted. The battles for Stalingrad and Berlin are likewise passed over in cursory fashion. The author Axell may argue that his book is a biography not a military history, but Zhukov was a general, if his actions and decisions on the battlefield aren't relevant then what is?I would have loved this to be a great book, regretably it is a very poor attempt."
1,Marshall Zhukov,"Disjointed, incoherent, rarely deals with the subject at hand; namely Marshall Zhukov himself. This book lacks any sense of structure or direction. In short, one of the worst biographies that I have ever read."
4,role and impact of zhukov,"i do not agree with the views of dermot doyle . the interpretation is amateurish and somewhat infantile. the book gives a fairly good idea of a man who played a very very critical role in holding of the nazis in the period before america entered the war .the impact of zhukov on world war 2. ,the world and the general fate of mankind ."
2,Looks Ok,"The paper is not poster quality, closer to a photo paper (fairly thick). The white border makes it obvious that this is not an authentic poster, and cropping is off as well. Mine also came with some scratches that show the white paper underneath, so shipping may be an issue."
3,Decent book.,"This books presents an unique way of looking at India as a whole. It does include biases, but the piece is not drenched in such informations. The Aryans DID come into India from Central Asia, despite what these other [people] who state otherwise. There is a strong amount of evidence. I suggest Hinduism books by David R. Kinsley and Indian Historical books by John Keay. They are highly UNBIASED."
1,Not a Good Read,"The book is written in a 2nd grade manner. It is very simplistic with numerous errors in grammar. The story really never goes anywhere. It drags with numerous repetitions and seems to be scattered in frame and development. While the characters are sincere, you never really buy into what is happening. The main character, Anna Grace, seems to be taken with herself and puts herself on a pedestal. The story is simple and unappealing, cannot recommend as a read for any level."
2,Intresting Parts...If you can find them.,"I am no marine biologist, but after reading many of these books, it gets drilled into my head that sharks aren't the eating machines 'everyone' claims them to believe. I think everyone interested in buying this book should already know that. The description of unique mating patters intrigued me, however. found that downplayed in the book."
4,Great Cd from 1980,"Tracklisting:1 Blondie Call Me (3:34)2 Irene Cara Fame (3:51)3 Linda Clifford Shoot Your Best Shot (3:51)4 Kano It's A War (3:41)5 Dan Hartman Vertigo/Relight My Fire (9:42)6 Brothers Johnson Stomp!

1,Negative reaction,"These lace up boots have caused severe blisters and bruises. i am trying to return them after having worn them for one day. They're worthless, make my feet sweat (faux-leather upper), and are absolutely the worst pair of shoes i have ever purchased. Please, if value your feet, do not buy shoes online and do not buy kenneth cole reaction."
1,worked only 5 months,I purchased this tiny lightweight mp3 player in march. This line- in recorder was just about everything i looked for in such a teeny size player plus radio to hear what's going on. Then on the fifth month of use it could not turn on. I looked for any reviews about this similar problem and tried to e-mail Creative but cannot get through at all. The phone service is for only 60 days and mine broke in 150 days. I tried to download the firmware and it still didn't work. They should include an address to ship for repairs in their booklet.
4,Mu Vo N200 MP3 Player,"I selected this MP3 based on a lot of other reviewers' opinion. 1 GB is actually not big enough for me, probably 2 GB would be sufficient. The features are okay: FM radio, voice recorder. Voice recording quality is not good enough for music applications, but sufficient for lectures, ...Sound quality is good, small size and light is very good. The menu (humand system interface (HSI)) structure can use a lot of improvements. Otherwise, I like it even more. I shop on the web a lot, merchandise came as promised, but could be quicker like other sites that I am used to."
2,Shuts-down Unexpectedly,"I loved this thing when I first got it, but after about a week, it started shutting-off in the middle of songs. I returned it for a new one, but that one had the same problem. If you search around, you'll find people saying that upgrading the software fixes this. Don't believe it - I applied the latest firmware and mass storage drivers, but the problem persists and the player is unusable. Creative support has been responsive, but won't acknowledge the problem. I got so frustrated, I established a buyer beware page dedicated to this device at mikehicks.googlepages.com. My advice: save your money and get an iPod Nano or something similar instead."
1,Product broke after 3 weeks,"This would be a great product, if it worked right. I used this product for 3 weeks (and I was very careful in handling it) but now, when I turn it on, it will produce an enormous amount of static noise and automatically shut down after 3 seconds. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Starts off great -- starts failing shortly after,"This is the second MuVo I have bought. The first one was the 256M storage capacity and after 3 months it started turning itself off during a song all the time. I used it at the gym and figured I must have dropped it or something and assumed it was my fault it wasn't working well. So, like an idiot, I buy the 1GB MuVo and within 3 months, it starts turning itself off in the middle of songs all the time. I tried contacting the company for warranty info and they have NEVER responded. Money down the drain. Don't waste your time with these tinker toys. Spend a little extra and get something good."
4,Magnificent MuVo !!,"This is one of the best little device that I have ever purchaced. It is so tiny it can fit in a pocket out of site without any problems. I use it to listen to books as well as music. Put in combination with a pair of Hi quality Sony ear buds and I have an almost invisible entertainment source.My wife has a 40Gig Nomad but she is envious of the MuVo Mini's tiny size, and our son has asked for one for Christmas.I'd give it 5 stars except for the power source. To small, but for the features provided it's a good trade off."
5,Perfect. That's the best way to describe this...,"I can't say enough good things about this device. It was a great buy. It (a) plays MP3/WMA songs, (b) allows you to convert all of your old records, tapes & CDs to MP3 format very easily using the built in line-in encoding/recording [in other words, no PC is required to convert your files], (c) you can listen to and RECORD live FM radio like a DVR device, (d) you can drag & drop MP3 files using Windows Explorer directly to the device - as it adds a drive letter to your PC when you plug it in, (e) it has a superb battery life, (f) it has a huge storage capacity - 1 gibabyte worth of space, (g) it's teeny tiny and (h) it functions as a voice memo/recorder with it's built in microphone, (i) and there are too many more good features to list. This a MUST HAVE DEVICE for anyone who enjoys music and/or audiobooks. It's cool, sleek and very functional."
2,Best Flash player IMO,"Best solid state player. Only 1GB but that's plenty. Excellent navigation lets you jump from playlist to playlist (sorted easily by creating directories, so no playlist creation necessary). Replaced by the Zen Nano this year."
1,Worthless product,"Based on some positive online reviews, I bought this player a few months ago. At the moment, the player won't boot up. And when it does boot up, it shuts down in the middle of a song after which, you guessed it, the player won't boot up. There's only one sensible advice to give about this player: DO NOT BUY IT, DON'T EVEN ACCEPT IT AS A GIFT!"
1,Aviod this item,"i bought this item and after exactly 3 days it started shutting down in the middle of songs, dont buy this item unless u wanna feel really disappointed, its completely new and dont work, i wasted my money, and to return it u have to call the store to get a return authorization number to be able to send it back to them until they review its status, WHATS THAT?!!!! anyway, avoid this item even with all the good reviews, its a trick from the store, maybe the ones who wrote are people working there or something, keep your money in your pocket, its made in china too, so expect."
1,Tiny buttons and controls break,"Nice features are not enough, if the player stops working properlyI''ve bought two of those on amazon.com. After 2-4 weeks each had a similar problem it started turning itself off. In the first case, the problem was with the play/pause button, in the second the problem is with the navigation button. When I navigate to previous or next, the device usually turns itself off after a few button presses.The device was not dropped and the buttons were not overused.Conclusion: Avoid this product!"
2,Keep Your Receipt,"The player has been a constant fight with failures and fixes. You will need to load it with the latest firmware version (1.15.01 as of this writing). This will avoid a stream of inevitable problems that are in the prior loads (1.11.01 and 1.12.01).This is not a guarantee that you will not have playback problems. I have owned mine 4 weeks and now at firmware version 1.15.01 as of this writing and am still having intermittent problems loading contentto the player. It frequently says that i have a compatibility problem while loading a file. From that point forward, no content will load. The fix is to reformat and reload everything. This takes at least 30 min to an hour.The size and funtionality are otherwise great. Too bad about the reliability."
4,Super small -- We like it!!,"I got the Zen Muvo TX 1GB for my wife. She uses it as FLASH driver and MP3 player.Since it is 1GB and it works as an USB Mass-Storage device, she uses it to transfer architecture drawings between office and home. The USB 2.0 connection is pretty fast, but we did not measure the speed so we don't know if it is actually maxing out the USB link.One reason why we picked the Muvo is because of its size. It is super small. My wife uses it when she jogs. 1GB carries more songs that she can run. :) The song quality is very good thru the headphone. We did not connect to any Receiver or AMPs, so we don't know the actually. Is the SNR 90dB or 120dB? We don't know and we did not care. It is good enough.-- Mike"
1,"Great, while it worked","I bought this ""gem"" in July with a promo deal through [...]. The player worked great for a few months but I can't get the darn thing to work now. I'm having the same issues as the other reviewers, it won't boot anymore. I'm seriously considering a different brand. I have a Creative Nomad IIe that's worked for years. Ughh!"
3,ok but,The box arrived damaged. One of the handles was broken off. The other design problems were gaps between the steel and one side somewhat loose. I used some fire rated caulk I had to seal the gaps. If you are serious about fire protection of your documents or items I would look at buying a little better product. Still the size is what I like about it. It is large and the price is reasonable.
1,Second one sent to me that has a small dent in it. Not happy at all,First box that Amaons ent to me i had to send back. Second one still had a damage spot. I domt feel there should be any dents at all.
4,Safe within a safe,I found this size box fits my letter-size documents without a problem. I primarily use this fire retardant box as a box within a big safe as added protection for important original documents.
4,Box is fine,"This box is a little larger than I really wanted, but it is the size of documents so you don't need to fold them. I bought it because it is fire-retardant which I hope I never need to test and not as heavy as the fire-proof boxes. What I don't like about the box is that it doesn't stay closed without locking it. I wish it had a latch or something to keep it closed when it doesn't need to be locked."
5,"Sturdy, Good value","I don't need to repeat the positive comments about this box. The handles are very convenient.It's roomy and serves my needs. I have another, slightly smaller box which has a clip on the inside of the lid which is convenience for keeping car titles or birth certificates handy, which this doesn't have, but no big deal."
4,good document security bpx,"This box is well made and just the right size to store our important documents (passports, titles, insurance policies, most recent tax returns) without having to fold them. It is easy to carry and store. We live in a hurricane area and need to be able to grab our most important stuff and run if a big storm comes our way. The price was fair and it was delivered promptly."
3,Nice flexible neck and functional,But I am not sure about the battery life. I hardly used it for a few hours and the light has been dim since then.
3,Not Bright enough,"I wanted something to illuminate my pc laptop keyboard,but not quite bright enough for me..May be better for a book..Rotti699"
4,It's a vent register and it's brown...,"These registers were purchased to replace some less than eye pleasing (deteriorating) registers in our house. The fit was exactly what I was looking for and it certainly ""brightened"" up the place.You can't go wrong with new registers..."
3,Gets the Job Done,"Let's face it, it's a dirt cheap cassette player with little or no bells and whistles. The ""bass"" button does close to nothing, the overall sound quality is slightly less than ""OK,"" and there are only wires for front speakers and not for rear. That being said, I'm not complaining. I actually love this thing. It was easy to fix the rear speaker problem by splicing a few wires together on the wiring harness. Don't forget, if you are looking for sound quality, you shouldn't be looking at a $30 cassette player.The perks are as follows:-There is almost nothing to break or go bad.-It was super easy to install.-No one is going to steal a cassette player from your car unless they are clinically insane or terribly stupid.-The 1/8"" stereo jack is perfect for use with an iPod or MP3 player.-It's dirt cheap."
3,DUAL XC4100,This unit is worth the money so far. I did not expect a top of the line deck. When you have an early 1970's vehicle and dont want to butcher the dash you dont have much choice anymore. I am running this unit without amplification as it is just in one of my work vehicles. Drives two good 4 inch speakers just fine without distortion. Has a RCA type sub outlet for those needing to jack things up. Came with all necessary mounting items and good installation instructions. The only 2 negatives I have is the radio station tuning seems to be a bit weak (I live ruraly)and there is NO treble/bass adjustment other than a bass boost button that does increase lower levels.
5,Good item,Good basic radio with a mini plug input. Plug your MP3 or CD player and it plays directly on your car stereo...nice!
4,So far so good...,"Fast shipping, arrived as advertised, installed easily. The shafts are not adjustable, so some slight dash modification was required. Of course it looks and feels cheap...because it is!!!!!!"
4,Very high tech!!!!,This is about as high tech as you can get when it comes to car stereos.The only thing wrong that i noticed was that the slot for the cds was too small and i could not fit a cd inside. Also the navigation part was a little tricky to use. I guess I'll have to read the directions a little bit to familiarize myself with this product.
2,Do not expect a fit.,"Let me first state that I knew going in that this was a very low end unit. That being said, buyer beware. I bought this for my 69 Cutlass because 1) I do not drive it that much and 2)I was not going to spend 200+ for a USA-1 radio for the car and 3)I just wanted some noise. The volume control and tuning controls do not have adjustable shafts, so the unit will not match up to the original radio plate holes. Additionally, the shaft opening for this particular car is 2-3 MM smaller that the the width of the unit, so even if the shafts were adjustable, the radio would not fit through the shaft hole in the radio plate."
5,A great little stereo,I have purchase this stereo about three weeks ago and atached the speakers and it worked wonderfully. I attached a antenia to the radio and this boost the radio signal. The sound quality is very good. It plays my MP3 with such clearity it is unbelieveably.
1,not as advertised,"This unit was advertised as a replacement for older dual shaft units. This is not the case. It is in fact a DIN unit masquerading as a dual shaft product, that is incompatible with original shaft-mounted units."
2,Cheap product not worth it,sound quality is really badmodel is onlyit can only connect to the two front audios of my car
1,DONT BUY!!!,"I received this item was exited it was perfect for my application, to bad the first one was defective and my replacement had another defect. two out of two were defective not looking good for the craftsmanship of their products a Dual"
1,Junk,"It sounds okay, but the volume control is so poorly made that the unit is just about unuseable. Don't buy this if you have a temper, because someone could get hurt. Not worth five dollars."
4,If you need knobs...,I needed a knob deck for my log loader and this was the only one I could find with an aux jack for my iPhone. The price is right and it does what it claims. Also a nice touch it has a set of preamps in case you want to add an amp.
2,Needs Treble,"Cheap is good and basic is fine, but who makes a radio with notreble? To muddy, remove the cassette and leave the radio andinput for ipods and sattelite XM and it may actaully be cheaper,but no treble is unforgivable"
1,Not what I was expecting,"I thought that this would be made of a much sturdier material. It is really chintzy, and I doubt it would keep anyone out. Not sure what it would be useful for! I thought the price was way too high for what this product is. I guess the only good thing is its size. Oh, and I couldn't even get my hand under the handle to carry it comfortably...I had to have my friend work on it by adding a metal link.Had I bought it locally, I would have returned it."
2,Arrived improperly packaged and damaged,"The product arrived dented with a broken lock. It had been packaged in a box that was slightly too shallow and evidently rather than getting a bigger box, the person packing just slapped some tape on and hoped for the best. I think the box itself would be fine for its purpose but unfortunately it was unusable when I received it."
5,Power Drive V2,I ordered this to replace a 17 year old TURBO PRO 812 (42lb thrust) that finally died (parts no longer available). Noticed two things: 1) bolted up to my existing mount and 2) has significantly more power than my old motor. Would recommend this trolling motor to anyone looking to upgrade.
3,Nice set!,Our 2 1/2 year old grandson loves this set. He plays with it just about every time he comes over. It is wood and well made and offers something a little different than plastic.
5,good quality,I have always been happy with all my purhcases of Melissa & Doug products. They are made of high quality materials.
2,Nothing Special,My kids prefer to use the plastic tools better than these wood ones. It doesn't really keep their attention as well and not as much for them to do. I was disappointed because I generally prefer wood toys.
3,go with playdoh,not a fan of this playdough. its stiff and the wooden piece really dont do much. i love wooden toys but this one was a bust.
5,This was a gift.,My Granddaughter loves this set. She has just started playing with play-doh. She loves the all the different designs she can make.
1,"Wonderful idea, terrible peeling paint","This is a wonderful idea and my 2 1/2 year old loved playing with it -- for about three days. Then the paint started coming off the molds. Even though my son is past the stage of putting everything in his mouth, this seemed like a health hazard and I returned it."
2,Not up to par.,"The rollers are too small and don't move smoothly. One washing of the stamps and they fell apart, wooden pieces, unusable after that. I don't recommend this Melissa and Doug toy although I do love many others they make."
2,Not as great as it looks,"i thought the toy was better in the photo than what we received. the pieces were a lot smaller than i thought they'd be and not as well made as they appeared. the 4 press in round stamp toys were cheap plastic with sharp edges on the back where the kids would hold them to push them into the play-doh - not comfy or safe for little hands or big hands either! i thought they were going to be solid round wood stamps. the square shape stamps were made of wood and were ok, but very very small. the rollers were also very small. i was honestly pretty disappointed and didn't think it was worth $[...]."
