2,Sloppy and full of typos,"Love the concept because I am definitely in the ""Second Acts"" demographic. However, it is very discouraging to find so many typos in a published book. Especially a book that is meant to inspire and build confidence. If it's executed sloppily, why should I believe the content is any better? I am returning my copy for a refund."
4,A Real Key To A Better Life?,"Self-help book junkies like this reviewer probably like the genre for its own sake. For the most part, we do not expect such books to help us make significant changes in our own lives. The number of us who actually work with them to see if they can upgrade our existence must be very small. Our skepticism runs very deep--yet perhaps one reason we are skeptical is that we have not been ready to try the techniques the books offer. Personal experience suggests that sometimes outstadning results can be achieved through some of these techniques.Stephen Pollan and Mark Levine's ""Second Acts"" looks like agood book, one worth both reading and testing. The bookpurports to offer a map to the life of the reader's dreams.It is not an easy or painless or miraculous road. That isexactly why, in this reviewer's opinion, it has an above-average chance to work.But only if we work it. Life is like that."
2,I agree with the above sentiments::::::::,As a 50+ woman..I'm searching for the book that chronicles ordinary women like myself that have done spectacular things by taking chances..risks..regardless of age..and have succeeded in second or third etc careers and by doing so have become financially independent...I'm seeking inspiration!
2,Second Acts Are Easier When Your First Act Was Great,"The authors draw upon Hillary Rodham Clinton, George Foreman and former junk bond king Michael Milken as examples of great second acts. How hard can it be if your first act was First Lady, boxing champ or Wall Street insider? These books always lose credibility when they draw upon celebrities as examples, simplistically implying that stardom is within your reach. Even using J.K. Rowling as an example is poor, since that kind of publishing success is a one-in-twenty-million phenom.If it makes you happy, buy it."
3,Not his best Work,"I am a saxophone player myself, and I find Mr. Redman to be one of the most elite contemporary sax players, yet ""Passage of Time"" is, in my opinion, not of his standered caliber. While it is very introspective and the muscicianship of the quartet is astounding, I feel that it lacks the emotion and the energy of his other cd's. ""Wish,"" ""Timeless Tales for Changing Times,"" and ""Moodswing"" are all superb cd's with much more intensity than that of ""Passage of Time."" I do believe this cd will play an integral part in the development of Mr. Redman, but quite frankly, i do not particularly enjoy listening to this cd."
3,A Good Straight Ahead Date...That's All,"A Love Supreme? Get Real & be honest with yourself (instead of thinking what makes you feel good). This is good jazz, don't get me wrong. Josh Redman has developed into a good player/leader, and ""Passage of Time"" is an interesting and enjoyable listen. But the album is lacking in energy with comparison to ""A Love Supreme"" or anything Trane put his chops to, for that matter.The mainstream media has given him too much attention while flat out neglecting numerous musicians of similiar or greater caliber."
3,"Phenomenal player, but not his best work","This album appears to have been recorded entirely in one LONG take, each tune seamlessly flowing into the next. That takes guts! However, I strongly prefer his more recentElasticorFreedom in the Groove, as well asSpirit Of The Moment: Live At The Village Vanguard."
2,Not a recommended book,"If you want to know what features Macromedia Studio MX 2004 has, this book has that information for you. But, if you want to learn ""using"" this tool, it's not a good choice. In many sections, it just mentions that the tool has so and so features and it doesn't instruct you how to use them. The materials that can be free downloaded from Macromedia website are much more helpful than this commercial book. I gave it up by reselling it for much cheaper - I'm still happy with it. Thanks!"
1,Scorpion King,"Do not waste your money seeing this movie, it is terribly bad, poorly made, bad actors .. cheap ... twenty people running to one side another ten dying for the other ,major players no one .... I want my money back"
2,One liner central.,Overhyped B rate movie. Please bring back the Rock if there's ever a part 4. Could have been much better.
2,Price comment only,This DVD is in pre-order status and is priced like our fuel. A DVD at $25.49 (blu-ray is $.50 cheaper) will certainly stop me from purchasing it. May I suggest no one pre-order this movie until the studio (Universal) drops the price? Avatar (20th Century Fox) got away with a blu-ray release in a bare bones edition which included NO special features. A first for blu-ray that I have noticed. Take a stand or this will continue.
3,OK movie,"OK movie, but....where's The Rock?? Better special effects, but could use a bit more direction towards the original move and ending."
2,The Scorpion King,Movie was not as good as the first two really disapointedbut you win some and you loose some but received on time.
3,Scorpion King 3,Number 1 was very good. Number 2 was good. Number 3 is okay. Number 3 completes the trio. I am not sure a fourth would help the saga. All good things eventually come to and end...
2,This movie sucked,I did not like this movie. Too many actor changes. I bought it before watching it and I regret it.
2,"Three, I think not!","One of the dumbest flicks going. And how on earth did it follow up on the original movie? The graphics were poorly done. It appeared that even the animals were sedated. Not worth ten cents, let alone the price charged."
3,Not that good.,It was corny actually. Not that good of a movie. I wouldn't even sell it at a yard sell. Sorry to say but that's what I think about it.The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption
1,Shakey Camera Throughout - Very Poorly Done,"This movie was VERY POORLY DONE - bad set design & creation, poor script, mediocre acting (Ron Pearlman was especially bad), one main character seems to have gotten his part due to his ability to constantly burp, and the camera work is especially bad. They did invest in some good action sequences, unfortunately you're forced to watch them thru what appears to be a camera mounted on the shoulder of someone who just can't manage to hold still for a moment.With this type of movie you should not have high expectations, and I did not - even so, I was hugely disappointed and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE."
3,Scorpion king 3,The movie arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It was good enough for me to keep in my collection.
3,King,"The movie was ok but not having the Rock in it took something away from it. I was disappointed in the acting of some of the characters, and plot of the story."
2,A movie for fans of the series only. I couldn't get into it. Makes original look like Oscar winner. I say D+,"""Your mission is to defeat my brother."" Mathayus's (Webster) kingdom has fallen and his wife has died. He is now an assassin that is hired by King Horus (Perlman) to stop the rise of his brother and the army of ghost warriors. I have to start off by saying that I didn't really like the original. To me it was very cheesy and over the top and more of a comedy then an action movie. After watching 2 & 3 the first one looks like an Oscar winner. This review will be short because it was a struggle to make it through and I did end up falling asleep a few times and I think I missed some important stuff, but I didn't care enough to rewind it. If you like the others you will like this one. If you didn't then I would avoid it. Overall, a movie for fans of the series only. I give it a D+."
1,scorpion king 3,"I was expecting a pretty good movie as I enjoyed 1&2.Wow was I disappointed no plot rambling story line.Lots of action but it sucked,poorly done.Billy Zane could have phoned in a better performance I think he ""under the influence"" or just brain dead."
1,do not order,no good do not order dvd only needed to watch about 10 min i sent the dvd back very good return policy
1,Scorpion King 3,"I thought I should get the word out and warn any would be Amazon buyers here that this movie has got to be the worst film ever made! Wife and I seen it through Netflix the other week and I told her that I was glad that we didn't drive some 50 plus miles to see this turkey when it was playing in the theaters. I wouldn't have it in my DVD collection if Amazon or Wal-mart was giving it away free, I kid you not it was that bad. One star is too high a rating for this bomb. If you feel that you must watch it than I highly suggest you do it through Netflix or Red Box you will be saving yourself some money."
1,What a let down,"I thought it would be similar to the original 'Scorpion King', but alas, not so. They really did a bad job on this one and it only goes to prove that not ALL sequels are good. Skip any 4th sequel, for sure."
2,Big Disappointment for the 3rd Scorpian,"Though an avid fan of fantasy/action films, and having loved the first two Scorpian King movies, this third one was a real disappointment. The acting was flat, the plot jumped around more than fleas on a dog, and the villainous characters were so....well - fakey! Action scenes reminded me more of a cheaply made kung-foo movie, and the character were flat and not very interesting. I did not develop even the least interest or empathy for any of them. About half-way through the movie, I was so tempted to just fast forward it or jump right to the end. If you have liked the previous Scorpian King movies, please don't waste your time or money on this poor imitation, masquerading as of part of the previous series. I give this movie a 5 thumbs down!"
3,its not all that great...,"we ordered this and wasnt really very happy with the movie itself. one and number two were definetly better. its not that the movie is terrible, but it is only average i would say. i cant say it is the type of movie to watch a second time just because its that good. and we too still miss the rock in it. but all in all the movie could had been better and thought it would be, but its not. just our thoughts on it. have a good day."
1,"""Direct to video"" or ""direct to trash can"" release?","I have a soft spot for the Mummy's sequels and spin offs. But this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong,the director and cast tried their best with an obviously low budget to make a decent movie. But they failed.Therefore we ended up with a movie full of crappy acting, crappy story, low budget and sadly no redeeming point whatsoever. Let be put it this way, I would rather be stung three times by a deadly scorpion than to have to see this movie ever again."
3,Tongue in cheek,This is not a part 3 installment of THE SCORPION KING movies. But a parody. Its not great or good. But not horrible either. Rent at your peril! lol. But don't buy it.
3,Not as good...but still delivers !,"Ok, its not as good as the original, and you dont have monsters and too manyspecial effects, but you do have pretty good acting on all parts, ninjas andgood enough battles, but what takes the cake in this one is the gorgeous sceneryof on location filming in Thailand, and not all shot on bluescreen as most moviesdo these days. So yes, i was entertained by this attempt."
2,Good idea bad product,"The idea is good even beyond your imagination. Very easy to set up. You will have more fun if you set it up with internet.The major disappointment is that I find ONE dead red pixel on the monitor. Call Sony for the resolution and my answer is that the moniter is not defect base on their guide line. No exchange, however, I can send it back to repair on MY OWN COST (not cover by the 90 days warranty!!!!!!). They even say the price will be double up to make it 100% dead pixel free. And the statemnet inprinted on the owner menu, you can download it from Sony's website.This is very disappointed. A dead pixel on the monitor is defect. I can buy a 17"" LCD monitor with less money and 100% no dead pixel. If you plan to buy one of this. My advice is checking the monitor before you pick it up if you can. Good luck, because will cost you same amount as buy a new one."
5,Scholarly translation from the original Arabic,"Noted scholar Menachem Mansoor makes an extremely valuable addition to the wealth of literature on Bachya ben Yosef ibn Pakuda's extensively-studied treatise on spirituality and ethical behavior. Whereas most extant popular translations are taken from Ibn Tibbon's definitive Hebrew translation, Mansoor works from the recovered Arabic version -- the language in which Bachya wrote. The result is a deeper and richer understanding of the subtleties of this already remarkable work."
4,First class piece of film criticism,"Schickel is not a great film writer, although he is very influential. He gives an excellent introduction to the Wilder classic Double Indemnity and gives a good background to the film.Schickel could have done more and looked at the various interpretations of the film, but he is content to keep it focussed on its history."
4,"A mystical, adventurous journey into Scotland's past.",This book has it all--from the feuding clans in the highlands to the forbidden love of Lorna and Ian to the battlefields of WW1 and the ghosts of Scotland's past. I found this book to be a very enjoyable read.
4,not Quite truth in advertising,"sent check for full price fairly promptly, but not including tax, which ads say they will do"
1,Terrible customer service!!,"I purchased this plan for a camera that I purchased from amazon and was not successful in reaching them. I called, emailed, called, emailed and nothing x2months!! I ended up asking for a refund and that took forever with several emails and phone calls!"
1,Think about your credit card protection first!,"Most credit cards (Amex, Visa) offer loss and damage protection, and extended warranty protection. Amex, for example, doubles the manufacturer's warranty up to and for at least 1 year.Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25% of the product cost in extended warranty protection. I think it's worthless."
2,Read the terms and conditions!,"First, I have called them, and the person I spoke to was very friendly and personable. Which is why I'm not giving the service two stars.HOWEVER, before purchasing this, I suggest that you carefully read the terms and conditions. Very few things are covered. From what I can tell, the only thing that would be for the $150-175 range would be a glitch in the actual hardware of the item. It does NOT cover normal wear and tear, theft, or acts of God, for instance.Things are only covered after the manufacturer's warranty ends.Also, it doesn't say that the 1-year replacement plan begins after the manufacturer's warranty ends, so I would wager that it doesn't... I could be wrong, though."
3,1-Year Replacement Plan for Electronics Products $150 to $174.99 (Purchased on 12/15/2006),N/A it has not had to be used at this point
4,A much needed survey of a neglected topic,"The problems of rural America were one of the driving forces behind the New Deal. The pragmatic approach to policy making which characterised the implementation of the New Deal is often over looked in current discussion, largely because people think of what worked as the only possible solutions.Prof Grey's book is an invaluable addition to the bookshelf of anyone studying public policy or the sociology of rural areas."
2,Delicate Wings,I bought this remote Dragonfly as a Christmas gift for my grandson. The first time we took it out we were having great fun. Then while it was flying it took a nose dive and when we retrieved it both wings had a tear in them. They should come with an extra set of wings or at least you should be able to buy extra wings as they are very delicate.
5,Greatest board game to ever exist on planet Earth.,"one of the most impressive board games to have existed. it's simple, fun, and addictive. will forever change one's life."
5,Best board game,Most fun I ever had with a game. The art is it's primary attribute followed by the story lines. There are expansion packs and even a website with a few more adventures.
3,"Wow, it was a great game. Not worth 300+ though",We bought this back in 1989 for 20 bucks at Toy's R Us. We used to play AD&D; 2nd edition and thought it would be a great way to get a ton of miniatures for a cheap price.We ended up playing Hero Quest a dozen or so times but found it wasn't as good as playing D&D; so we shelved it and used the miniatures instead for RPG goodness.I was looking for it and couldn't believe the insane price.
4,Captures the Culinary Spirit of France,Robert Freeman's stunning photographs are the meat & potatoes of this beautiful coffee-table book -- the descriptive writing and recipes from authorities like Richard Olney & Anne Willan put it right over the top. This book is a classic that truly captures the culinary spirit of France.
3,Corals are cool,This is more of a history lesson and an accolade to Darwin than a book on corals. But it is interesting to get different opinions.
2,Very Basic,There is not much information past name and lighting. Very very basic. Needs more meat to make this worth reading!
3,How well I liked my purchase,"It was waaaayyy old. The pages were really yellow and if I tried to ""dog ear"" them, they ripped and fell off the page because it was so withered and decrepit."
1,Really people?? I wish I could give it less than a star...,"*spoiler alert* (for all the haters)This book is overwrought and painful to read. The first page or so is spent just describing the horizon, really, who cares?? The plot of the story would have been somewhat interesting if it had not been written by Thomas Hardy. Like The Scarlet Letter, the story is good but the delivery of the writing is dreadful. I'm glad something BAD happens to Eustacia Vye, she's selfish and ungrateful. And people actually like this book? Whyyyyy??"
4,Return of the native,Much verbiage but that is consistent with Hardy. Its his style - very very descriptive. It's a classic. I enjoyed the story very much but was glad when I finished it.It is a novel that I should have read in high school but I didn't. Now that I have retired I had the time to spare.
5,"Beautiful, enthralling and universal","""The Return of the Native"" is perhaps my favorite novel. The passionate Eustacia Vye is perhaps my favorite female character in literature: not because she's ethically flawless but because she's painted by Hardy in such a stunningly beautiful way. Her passions and longings seem very real to me. The descriptions of Egdon Heath do not get overbearing and Hardy perfectly places his conflict of humanity in this unforgettable environment. Unlike Hardy's ""Jude the Obscure"", I rather think this book has a positive ending and I do not view it as a completely dreary tragedy. It's a classic piece of literature and one of my favorite novels. Highly recommended! Also, you need to hear Alan Rickman read this. His performance enhances the already memorable novel."
1,Waste of time and money.,The game took only 29 minutes to play and only if you know the punch lines of Jeff's jokes do you do well.We played it once and then it gathered dust until it went to Goodwill.
4,whole family can play!,"it's not easy to find this type of game. it is very fun and everyone can play. not difficult to understand, easy set up."
1,Too complex and not very fun,After 90 minutes of play and no sight of an end we gave up. Got old very fast. I am a huge Jeff Foxworthy fan but this game was way to complex for a redneck like me.. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,Got boring fast,"I love Jeff Foxworthy, but unless you worship the guy, this game got boring fast. There was really no strategy to it, and many of the questions seemed like they could have multiple answers. It really is just an excuse to sit and tell Jeff Foxworthy jokes."
1,Manufacturer doesn't stand behind product,"I bought one of these directly from mojoplay.com in late February, 2006. The unit quit working in late May, 2006. It still has audio but the video is dead. I started noticing problems about 2 weeks before it died, the picture was turning very reddish when I first turned the unit on. Then the day before it quit there was a bunch of static in the picture. I realize I may have gotten a defective monitor to start with, but since the manufacturer wouldn't honor the ""1 year warranty"" I will be buying another brand from now on. They will not answer their E-Mails, will not answer the phone, and they apparently have their fax machine turned off so there is no way to get in touch with them."
4,Good educational game,A parent bought this game for my kindergarten class. What a great classroom present. The children have really enjoyed playing it. Think of making a donation to your child's school to commenorate a birthday or a when a child looses a tooth. END
4,Rotten Dinner,"Conrad Redman gets a call from his ex-girlfriend Lily Irish. On very short notice she wants to meet him at the ?Le Corbusier? restaurant. He can not resist and there the two of them sit, having supper. Enters a strange figure in the disguise of a bycicle messenger, pulls out a gun, kills Lily and sends Conrad to the hospital for six months. They catch the killer, but he will not talk. Conrad wants to find out who gave the orders for the shooting spree. Lily?s parents - Josephine and Robert ?The Mistake? - are of little help. Anne Marie, Conrad?s new girl friend, energetically marches along, but he soon tires of her.While it is a fun story, the ending is less than satisfying. Some of the red herrings tend to be barracudas."
4,great,deliver on time great deal if you do not have time to stop at a hardware store and pick it up yourself
3,Not what I expected,WWII documentaries usually fascinate me but this one did not hole my interest. Not sure why but it wasn't what I expected. Perhaps it was too 'clinical.'
5,The last hours of Hiltler's life revealed,"This is an amazing story of the man who lived in Hitler's court, working as his telephone operator and bodyguard, tells a Jewish woman from Israel about the final years of Hitler's life, about his last hours. Thrilling untold story."
4,Beauty but not quite a beast,"I recently orderedthis system. Right out of box it is super easy to assemble (a big plus for me). It is truly a handsome system with more than acceptable sound reporduction quality for a system of its size and price. The directions were actually comprehensible.I hope the quality is maintained since other Philips's systems have been a disappointment, but so far (2 days) this is a recommended system either for a desktop or to be well hung on a wall."
3,"looks great, sounds average","This was a refurbished version, but it works well all the same, although the right cd tray now sticks, and needs to be given a nudge before it will open/close. the sound is a little tweety, not as full as i'd like, but thats to be expected from many flat systems w/o subs, i really like the looks and lights, and the functions are plenty"
2,Close but no cigar,Not the best bang for your buck. This stylish system is lacking in sound quality. Not to be used in a large room. It's cute..........
4,Kids enjoyed,Got this as a pre-Christmas activity while the cousins were all together for the holidays. The four cousins really enjoyed it (ages 4 - 10). It was worth the money. The kit is very small though. Each child was able to make about two pieces of chocolate (with some left over). So there's definitely plenty enough for the experience of making the chocolate but it would have been hard to enjoy with more than four children.
4,Very Rich Chocolate,Bought this as a Christmas present for a 8yo. Requires ALOT of adult help but does teach the process of making chocolate. This is not your high end milk chocolate but has a very rich chocolate flavor. VERY SWEET!!!!
3,Missing Items,"My daughter was thoroughly excited to receive this, but when it was opened, there were MISSING ITEMS: The temperature indicator and the cacao beans. We were able to proceed by buying the temperature indicator (candy thermometer) at a local store, but were none the less DISAPPOINTED due to the missing beans."
2,Very tiny and poorly packaged,"This arrived in a badly dented, thin cardboard box. The kit is much smaller than I expected-- you can make a taste of chocolate for a few people, but not a significant quantity. It is overpriced for what you get."
4,Interesting,My kids enjoyed making their own chocolate and I found it interesting to see the whole process of making chocolate. It was edible and the kids had fun but it's a one time only thing.
1,Box Came flattened,When I opened the Package from amazon I found the chocolate Kit smashed. The box was flattened with items coming out both sides. It was a huge let down. It was to be a christmas gift for my daughter.....very dissapointing when it arrived :( Im sure it could be a nice kit But not When shipped like that!!
3,Not much for the Price,"Although the kit looks like it will be fun, I was shocked by how small the box was and how little materials you received. Not really worth it if you have more than 2 kids doing it. The Make Your Own Soda Pop kit gives you much more for the money, and you can buy refills anywhere."
4,2nd yr. in a row this has been requested.,Our kids love making this chocolate. It's a fun project to do together. I suggest to use a double boiler or make your own. We made it in the microwave the first yr and this yr. on the stove top. Way more fun on the stove and it smells amazing!
2,packaging destroyed upon arrival,I have yet to try this product but the packaging was a mess when I received it. This item is an intended Christmas present so already I'm not pleased.
4,"Loved the item, but displeased with packaging","I bought three of these as gifts for various chocolate lovers in my family; it is such a neat gift set (especially for kids), but I was unhappy with the flimsy packaging it came in. Two of the boxes arrived in good condition, but one had a crushed side. The contents of the box were okay so I did not return it, but I hated giving this as a gift in its damaged condition. Luckily, the damaged one went to my sweet nephew who didn't care as much about presentation as he did about the contents."
1,Horrible.,"This kit came in a torn up box, and it was missing THREE items! I'm so disappointed. This was going to be a fun activity for my daughter and I on Christmas but now it's just a waste of money. I'll be sending this back and hoping for a refund."
5,Absolute Must Have Little League Resource!,It's not who you pick in the draft or if you have the best pitcher.It is all in the practices. This simple book has it.Use it over the course of one season andI guarantee you'll see positive results. We did!PERFECT FOR YOUTH BASEBALL COACHES & PARENTS!
4,Baseball Drills That Score Big!,"A clear, concise, book thatLittle League coaches and parents will findvery useful. Baseball drills are the key to teachingyouth players the game and this book will put anynew or experienced youth coach on the right track tosucceed. Highly Recommended!Baseball Coaching:Schupak's Baseball Super 8 DVD SetLittle League coach or parent? Consider this popular DVD set on Amazon."
2,Not so erotic,"Erotic if you like somewhat overweight girls being screwed by a post-op transgendered wearing a strap on. This is a good piece of film work and visual ideas are interesting compared to many items in this genre, but I feel it would only be shocking or new to someone who had only seen R rated films before. As usual acting skills are completely absent, but at least it is a very good quality strap-on (wonder where you could buy one like it...?)"
2,Personally didn't like this,"Personally didn't really like this movie. The story line is OK. I liked the idea of the story. The acting is horrible. Low budget. Basically a softcore porn with a story. A lot of the sex scenes are not very attractive, unless you like a chick that obviously used 2 be a dude raping another girl, and girls crying. All the sex scenes are lesbian. The other girls are attractive though, just the one is a transexual, and kinda works with the story cuz shes a demon."
2,very disapointing !,This is a tipical lesbian boring movie the kind you can rent anywhere. I can assure you there is absolutely nothing special in this movie that you did not see in any other lesbian movie.If you find something exciting in this movie it's because your at your fist xxx movie.
1,So bad it is criminal...,"I bought this out of curiosity. What I got was a surprise home video sex tape. It is sooo bad in so many different ways I don't know where to begin. And to add insult to injury, the sex sucked. Lesbians or not if you want porn this ain't it. If you want a film, like one that you can actually watch, this ain't it. But if you are a film student and want to see how bad, bad film making can get, then use this as a guide for what not to do."
5,A lovely little book,"This latest in the ""Mark Twain Mysteries"" series may well be the best. Like the others, the mystery itself is secondary to the charm of the characters and the travelogue, but those are positive things and a recommendation.This book is a must-read for fans of the real Mark Twain and for historical-mystery fans. Heck has done his homework."
2,Hard to hear,I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter. I could not hear it. I turned it to the highest setting and had to put my ear right up to it. I tried changing the batteries and that did not help either. I ended up returning it. I wanted to try another one but they did not have any on the shelf. I ordered this one from Amazon and when I got it the batteries were already dead. Good thing I got a good deal on it and I was able to return it and get my money back. It would of been great if you could hear the songs.
3,Good toy,"This toy is fun enough to keep my 20-month old occupied for a few minutes because of the music. It's not outstanding for it's fun value or educational value, but worth the money as it was pretty inexpensive."
4,Great guitar! Except...,"This little guitar is great. I purchased it with the intention of maximizing my practice time. I am a professional fingerstyle guitarist and I wanted a little guitar that I could have strapped to me 24/7 to always be honing my skills. This is basically exactly what I wanted. I would have given the guitar 5 stars, but my only problem with it is changing the strings. I just changed the factory light strings to Elixir mediums and the whole process was a major pain! But, on a purely functional basis, the guitar gets 5 stars, even if it takes some adjustment because of the small body size.."
5,I feel it!,My family and I love this cd! We have share this cd with others. This is one of the best investment we have made in gospel music. We feel that if others hear Kyra they would buy her music too. Were waiting for more of God's music from this beautiful young lady.
5,"A ""Must Reading"" for students in Mysticism","Very helpful reading for students in mysticism, specially members of the Rosicrucian Order or Traditional Martinist Order, who want to deepen their study of Jewish mysticism. It is the basis for understanding the Kabbalah, but is of little use for the profane reader."
4,Great Buy for Students on the Path,This is a great book for anyone interested in the ancient writings of the past. Maybe you want to try and i stress try to solve its riddles or maybe your like the review says just a student on the path to enlightenment. This is a must have book for said student.
3,not for everyone,not as clear on what it it is trying to present for someone not already aware of some of the concepts
2,Complicated read,I bought this to read because my roommate suggetsed I read it to better understand things he was talking about. This was a very complicated read and I am not sure what I took away from it. I have never considered religion to be so mathematically based. Everything in this was numbers numbers numbers! I am sure I am goign ot have to re-read this a few times.
5,American politics and spirituality revisited,"This book overall is an excellent recap of what has happened in the world to bring us to our current place in time; in regards to religion, government, and commerce. I think it would be an excellent reading exercise for any learning institution, in Economics, or Political Science. I found it very informative and yet concise, with plenty of meat in it for discussion or debate; and backed up with foot notes. It really got me thinking and changed my mind too on some issues... and that is saying a lot!"
5,The BEST Group Ever,I've been listening to 911 for years. They are the best! I've been waiting a long time for a CD that I could share with the entire world. You haven't heard the best unless you've listened to 911. Drews vocals are magnificent. The guitars and drums get you moving. Rock will never be the same. Enjoy... Now I'm anxiously waiting for the second CD!!
5,Awesome,"Excellent CD! I love the rock and roll tunes, but truly enjoy Simple Life and Romeo and Juliet. I look forward to hearing 911 live one day soon. Until then, the CD will continue to play..and play..and play!"
2,Cat's Out of the Bag,"One of the most tedious books ever written, the only secret I'd like to know is what Mr. Olson subjected himself to in order to get the thing published. The book does get two points 1) for having been written and 2) for being profoundly odd. I also look forward to his next book. Not because I expect it to make a quantum leap in readability, but because the hero of Secrets is described as being lanky and handsome, with muscles he's made hard as walnuts from hours at the gym, and I have a hunch that this is what Mr. Olson looks like. No one but an egomaniac could write something like the Secrets of Mabel Eastlake and he must have a starring role in there somewhere. His picture on the back cover may be enough to induce me to pick the thing out of a remainder bin."
1,"Help, help, help, or give my money back!!!","I tried to install the software several times, but was always given the message that ""you cannot access this key"". I need to use this soon!!!This is so frustrating!!!"
4,"An excellent story, not so excellent publishing","I found this book enchanting and captivating. The characters of Curdie, the Princess, and the King are well developed, and likeable. Also, the plot is interesting and suspensful in many places. As a whole, this book is a bit more mature than the Princess and the Goblins, and I appreciate that maturity. It lends a more serious, but still just as fantastic, air to the book.But while the storytelling may have been first-rate, I cannot say the same of the publishing. While I like the idea of Print On Demand, the quality is diminished compared to a book published by a larger publisher. I found numerous typos, most notably incorrect capitalization. Many of the initial words of sentences were left uncapitalized. And although this may not make the book any less readable in the long run, it was annoying.I would recommend this book, but would recommend you find a copy of the Puffin edition, which (I hope) has been more carefully edited."
4,20 tea bags not 24!!!,"Please amend the quantity of tea bags in the box to reflect what you actually deliver, otherwise it is either a slight of hand when making the entry or fraud. There are only 20 tea bags delivered in each box."
3,Dissapointingly weak,"Although this tea has a very nice blend of flavors with terragon and lemongrass, it is simply too weak to use normally. I cannot use this with my regular 10 oz oversized teacup because the tea is simply too weak! There is half as much tea in these bags as there is in higher end teas such as Harney and Sons (my favorite peppermint)!"
1,What a joke!,"This book was a joke. How incredibly disappointing! It was focused on trying to prove that Islam is a valid religion and the Koran directly the work of God from him. The explanations made me more skeptical and wary of the entire Islam religion. According to the logic in this book, Nostradamous is a prophet of equal stature to Mohammed and should be revered. Nostradamous' quatraines were written in a similar style and can be interpreted to say he is predicting history and scientific principles that he could never have known in his time period. I am not against Islam, but this book really gave me a negative attitude, since it was trying to prove itself more than just expounding on what the beliefs are and what Islam is all about...."
5,A good introduction to Islam,"Very concise, illustrated and simple booklet for those who are curious to know about Islam. Of course it only scratches the surface and it is supposed to be only a door opener to read THE book of God: The Quran."
2,bought it for my library.,"Personally, I don't like it at all. I'm sure the materials it's made out of are standard and fine but my personal openion of Islam is extreamly low."
4,A lot of love has gone into this book,"I totally agree with the other reviews about this book - it is magnificent. The author has put so much into such a small book, you come away from reading it wondering how he managed to do it. There is even a note that you may pass this book on to others, or tell them about the website where the text is available.My only comment is about the structure of the book. While I agree with the scientific statements at the beginning of the book, I felt they should have come after the main introduction - which pretty much takes up the second half of the book.That is my only criticism, and a small one at that. If you are new to the subject, you will be enthralled and amazed by the facts stated - the prophet was illiterate yet he changed the face of history.A wonderful book, and an inspiration to all."
4,Waiting for the CD...,This girl has a great soothing voice and i can't wait until her full-length CD.
4,Hey DM was it the size remark in the song that bugged ya?,The music is different - her voice is different and her lyrics are fun and catchy - I highly suggest a listen - you might just like the whole album. Certainly an unusual thing to hear now a days.
4,Anyway...,I have White Turns Blue and it's absolutely great! Those who said that she can't sing sucks. You don't know what you're talkin' about. You just ear one song and then you say that she can't sing. This song only mean that she can be verstile. You're the only one is a very good song. The lyrics are funny and Maria's voice is really cool on most of her songs. So please if you ear only one song and then you judge on an hole career please just keep that for you.
4,Great educational toy,"I purchased this toy for my [...] old to educate her on where her Daddy travels each week. Initially, she played with the pieces and watched me put them back together. A month later, she is able to put all of the pieces together with a little help from me. Each piece do slide away a little bit, if you do not have the top, bottom, left or right piece to anchor it. (thus it is a puzzle). But, for a two year old, it could be a little difficult. What a great learning tool! She can say most of the states. I love how she says ""Mis-pi"" for Mississippi. She looks forward to playing with this map everyday."
3,mine didn't have an insert,"I agree with other posters - my 4 year old son loves putting this together and is quickly learning all the states. It is durable and fun. BUT, I am very disappointed that my order, from KiddielandToys, didn't come with the insert mentioned in other reviews. It would make it a lot easier for my son to do the puzzle without help."
5,Respectable and Collectible,"Although some of the recipes in this book may seem bit dated by todays standards, they are delivered in the style of the times which give this glossy, high fashion coffee table must-have it's period-piece charm. The photos are stunning and stories spellbinding. I just enjoy having this eye-catching book lying around. If you're looking for a more well rounded and informative book about bartending and mixology in general, you'll want to check outMiss Charmings Guide for Hip Bartenders and Wayout Wannabes"
4,WOW knocks 'em dead!,"HORTICULTURAL VINEGAR GALLONThis stuff works great! I used it in the heat of last summer & my weeds disintegrated within hours, especially affective on Canadian Thistle. I am waiting to see what if anything returns this spring. One note of caution, 20% acetic acid is pretty harsh on the skin, so don't spill it on you & avoid inhaling too deeply. :)Not exactly the cheapest weed killer out there, as the description suggests, since you don't dilute it. Definitely environmentally friendly though.thanks Bradfield!p.s. i had a strange desire for fish-n-chips during application!!!"
1,Lots of limitations,"The video shows an experienced welder using stick arc welding to weld plates together. No coverage of stick selection by size or type, no information on how to insure a strong weld with good penetration, no mention of how best to weld materials of different thicknesses, and no information on using wire arc welding equipment.One would be better off watching a couple of Youtube videos than buying this video on DVD or even buying a book with photos."
3,useful dvd,This tutorial is a bit rough on the edges but for the price still gives some good information.
4,"A Wild Ride of a Horror Film--Silly, but Occasionally Scary","_The Johnsons_ is a very well-made film. I tried to imagine how this material might look in a low-budget American film--we're just lucky that a Dutch film company and crew put this together. The plot is a very strange one, and ultimately a bit silly, but there are many very effectively horrific moments. To be honest, the basic story reminded me quite a bit of _The Relic_, with primitive jungle tribes and superstitions manifesting themselves in a modern, urban setting. The DVD has informative commentary tracks by the director and the co-writers and you can choose to watch it in Dutch or English (I'd recommend Dutch with English subtitles). This really is a pretty fun film and if you watch with the right frame of mind, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
4,A HORROR MOVIE WITH BRAINS!!!,"THE JOHNSONS is a horror flick that has a lot to offer viewers. For one thing it actually has a story-line, unlike most horror flicks. Also, the story-line is quite complicated, which is good because it makes you think. The acting is reasonalbe and the dialogue is not your typical horror dialogue. Teenagers may not like like it for all the above reasons, but the older horror buffs will be delighted. But beware: If you are annoyed by foriegn accents, in particular the Australian accent, you may want to think twice before buying this movie."
2,Let's go Dutch....on 2nd thought let's not,"The only good thing about this Dutch [movie] is the cover.Well Mommy and daughter are cute. That is the only thing this movie has going for it. I was so dissapointed with this film, I'll conclude quickly. There's no creatures (except a brief glimpse at the end). Big deal..the acting is ok, The Dutch location takes the cake though.. During a GARBAGE STRIKE! ... cares?? a dirty looking alley or something would have sufficed.They should have tossed this flick right in with it. Don't waste your money unless you like ... flix like this one that fell short of the trash can!..."
5,Simply awesome!,"This little book helped me review for a teacher certification test. Easy to follow, and allowed me to practice. I highly recommend this book to anybody wanting to review basic math and pre-algebra."
5,All Graduate Students Should Own this Book,"A large number of students (and postdocs?) within the sciences are not overly happy with research as a career, but say wistfully; ""What else could I do?""Well, there are TWENTY THREE 'alternative' careers in here, written by people who have made the transition. Each job is described in terms of information about how to make the transition, what a typical day is like, and honest assessments of positives and negatives of each career. There's also recommendations for how to position yourself for the transition.You may not find your 'dream job' in here, but even then you will learn about the wide possibilites which are available to you. You may decide not to switch careers, in which case you'll have learned enough to be more sure in your decision."
4,Pretty good stuff except for the smell...,"This product works well and fills a need, as there seems to be nothing like it in retail stores. However the smell is very strong, so beware if you are sensitive to chemical type odors."
2,CD to DVD,"It doesn't say if it is a machine, software or what. If software or a machine what brand? NO picture I bet you don't sell many."
1,If they're not smart enough to describe their product....,"If they're not smart enough to describe their product in a way that lets people get some idea of what they're actually buying (a book? a set of instructions? a service? an electronic device??), are they really smart enough to make a good product, whatever that might be??"
1,Please tell EXACTLY what this product does!!,"I am looking for software that can be used to convert analog audio to a file format that is compatible with car CD music players,i.e., software that produces multiple tracks on a CD that can be read by older car CD audio players. Does this instructional CD identify such software? I can't tell from the description. Please, someone, write a concise explanation of what is and is not included in this instructional DVD!"
2,Instructional DVD,I read the description with great interest -- but I am not familiar with conversion software. I decided not to buy because I do not know whether my PC has any DVD capability. Does this DVD play on a PC?
3,"If I didn't have to read it, I wouldn't.","Our monthly women's book group decided to read this book for February, 2001. While I thought the mini stories were entertaining they were at times difficult to follow. Feynman would be in the middle of telling one story, totally switch to an unrelated story, and then tell the ending of the first. The book would have appealed to me more if the writer had used a time line, and keep his thoughts in the order that they happened. Feynman's writing style left something to be desired."
1,What an egotist,"I read this book with the hope of gaining more insight into Dr. Feynman. While it is indisputable that the man was a physics genius and that he was a phenominal help during the Manhattan project, I grew tired of his incessant contempt for anything or anyone that he didn't approve of. Much of the book is spent with him trying to outmatch and outwhit those in fields that he considers inferior to physics, such as pure mathematics and philosophy. It grows tiresome reading this after a while and the book left me with no better understanding of this distinguished scholar."
3,Typeracer Hell,"The use of the word ""Portuguese"" in one of his anecdotes drops my speed by a good 10 wpm everytime I play Typeracer, dammit."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT FEYNMAN'S BEST","Feynman is of course one of the greatest physicists and pop science writers of all time, one of the originators of the genre. This book starts by recounting much of his childhood and early years through anecdotes (3-4 pages long usually, some funny, some not so much) about his relationship to science, starting with his initiation, to the ways he found to make money through it, and so on. The book continues on with many of these short stories, including his period in the Manhattan Project.Through written in short anecdotes that make it easily readable, I believe this is not Feynman's most interesting book. I would highly recommend ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"" as a much more thought provoking book. In it, Feynman not only tells stories, but also searches for meaning in life and physics and takes the reader along. In this title, it seems he only recounts stories, trying to be funny but never making the reader reflect deeply."
4,An inspiring and fun book,"Feinerman was an amazing man in so many ways. His life is a real lesson in doing all that you can, and enjoying every minute of your life. Loved this book."
5,"A genius of physics, common sense, and entertainment","I have read the Czech translation of Feynman's book 3 times, and the original 3 times as well. It was always a very entertaining experience, and the book was among the things that influenced me a lot.Richard Feynman has been one of the greatest and most original and unusual physicists of the 20th century. At the same moment, he was an ordinary, curious, emotional, straightforward man whose thinking was deeply rooted in common sense.However, this book is primarily a great portion of fun. Feynman's stories involving locks in Los Alamos, doctors who considered him insane, girls in the pub, paintings with naked women, physics, rabis, magicians, maps of a cat, and other things are simply irresistable.There may be other physicists whose life is (or was) equally entertaining and interesting as Feynman's life. But this book will make you sure that Feynman deserves your time."
5,Interesting view of life from an interesting man,"I really loved this book. Feynman's observations and look at his life. The two most important that stuck with me is his childish curiosity which he cultivated contributed to much of success. This childish curiosity is something I lost, and I am trying to recover."
5,Amazing.,"One of the most interesting characters in recent scientific history, if not all of scientific history. I love me some Feynman."
5,Smart Weirdo(which makes him so wonderful!),The presence of the greatest teacher (both in life and physics) can be felt intensely through this book. Filled with humour(which makes u think that he's god at times) and Feynman's funny style of finding out things just make you keep searching for more. The quest for understanding and knowing never stops.
3,"aaaaaaaahh, fair.","Okay, I admired and respected Richard Feynman alot and this book was a good read. But I agree with some of the other reviewers that he might have come across as being arrogant and that some of the anecdotes were gleefully condescending. I had the unconfortable feeling that I might have been one of the hopeless luddites he was lampooning! If you can get past this feeling, however, you will enjoy the book. It does reveal how a truly great mind works, warts and all."
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"Feynman the comedian is in this book. Feynman is well-liked because he was a womanizer, a performer, and an American Nobel Laureate which represent the good life."
3,Physics Is No Laughing Matter,"Whie I understand that this Nobel Laureate may have made some significant contributions to the study a physics, I find it tremendously inappropirate to make a mockery of it.Where woud we be without gravity or even string theory? I don't know, but I certainly do not want to go there. The honorable physician should take his job seriously, not all hokey jokey. Treat physics with the grace and dignity that it affords the universe."
5,"Absolutely Brilliant! (Entertaining, too!)","This book is so entertaining, so wonderfully written, and so full of inspiration that I read all 300-odd pages of it in two sittings. Each story has a character of its own, and has at least two GREAT, truly memorable lines.The most redeeming quality (and there are many!) of this book is Feynman's humility. Not once does he come off as arrogant, full of himself, or even really aware of his own genius.An absolutely fantastic book. I'll be reading it again."
5,This book simply changed my way of looking at things...,"It is without doubt one of the best books I've ever read. Besides being amusing and easy to read, it teaches you a lot about science and the way it should be approached. His life is an example to follow, and his autobiography is the best I've seen so far. I strongly recomend it to everybody, you don't have to be a scientist to read it!"
5,Excellent read!,Dr. Feynman's book is the most interesting memoir I've ever read! He's not just a scientist: he's an adventurer! This book includes his account of everything from the technical to the off-the-wall. Great read about one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.
5,Great book!!,"I read this when I was in school. I have bought it for my daughter now!! Its a well written book, intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable. If you are a parent looking for something to present your kids with, this is a wonderful one!!"
4,Funny 'Scientific' Biographies,I enjoyed this book. If you enjoy this kind of thing then I reccommend these 2 books: The man who loved only numbers - Paul Hoffman and Dancing naked in the mindfield - Kary Mullis
5,"A hero of our times, Richard Feynman","I first read this book in 1988 and have, since then, been a Feynman admirer. Once you read this book you will see why, of all the members, he was the indispenable man on the Challenger investagory commitee. Perhaps not as productive as Da Vinci, he had the same keen inquisitive mind and he also had the good sense to not become overly impressed with himself. Read it, you'll love it. Then you'll change the password on your computer."
2,Chilling Lack of Empathy.,"One of our times' most well known physicists tells some supposedly amusing anecdotes from his life in 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!', but in many cases I fail to see the humor. The writing is rather pedestrian, but the author does not purport to create great literature, only to amuse. Some of these anecdotes can be described as funny, but in many of the stories Feynman shows a glaring lack of empathy with his fellow man, and seems to be completely unaware of his shortcoming in this respect. Feynman was among other things involved in the Manhattan project, and if this is what passed for humor among the people who created the bomb, their moral stance (or lack thereof) becomes more tangible. It is a very chilling realization."
2,Unimpressive,"This book chronicles a few incidents in the peculiar life of Noble award winning physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman was a brilliant scientist and an inspiring teacher who led an eccentric lifestyle. Although most readers have loved this book, I found it to be boring and dull. A few of Feynman's so called adventures were pretty interesting and had a sparkle to them (like how he learned to open safes), but I thought most of his stories were boring, especially his adventures with ladies in bars. I was pretty disappointed with this one."
2,"The book was passable, Feynman's a prat","Are you all blind? This Feynman character is nothing more than a conceited, pretentious, stuck-up, high-and-mighty, pseudo-funny-guy. He has no respect for anyone with a single brain-cell less than him. ""Haha the dumb waitress poured water on the floor"" or ""Haha the dumb Captain forgot to set his safe"", he might have been a fantastic physicist but he obviously had the personality of a worm. Don't bother reading this book. He was one of a kind and now he's gone. Thank God."
2,"A better title ""I am so great!""","Clearly Mr. Feynman is brilliant, but he comes off as a self-aggrandizing jerk; always having to show that he's smarter than anyone else and playing 'jokes' on people that they probably didn't find so funny. Would I want to hang out with someone like that? Nope! Then why waste my time reading all of his clever anectodes?"
4,"A nice walk in the past or a true scientist, driven by curiosity","The book chapters are very uneven in terms of content and the writing is not that of a litterary scholar.Yeat, each chapter offers an experiement with a situatino of the lofe of Feynman and the author describes his search for new feelings and the ability to learn from them in a very eloquent manner."
5,Awesome Book!!!!,"Great book halfway through it right now!!!! Feynman is amazing, funny and brilliant. You will get a good laugh from this book."
2,"Poorly Structured, Kind of a Jerk",Not only was this book not structured in an meaningful way - it was just an extended series of anecdotes - it also portrayed a not pompous and at sometimes flat-out rude man.
4,This is Mr. Feynman,"Usually auto biographies (altough this book is written by a friend, its contents are taken directly from the mouth of Dick Feynman) are apologetic and with the objective of gathering sympathy from the readers, right? wrong! Richard Feynman is a brave man, and is not afraid to show is weaknesses and failures alongside with is triumphs (sometimes those simple things that made him happy like learning how to play bongo or samba in brazil).It's very interesting to discover that genius worry with the same things as we common mortals. Like how to get a date from a pretty lady (altough I don't agree with is way, but it worked for him...).This is a very good book that makes interesting reading, buy it."
5,One of the great minds of the 20th century,"A regular guy, a genius, a mischievous prankster, a true problem-solver, and out-of-the-box thinker, and ultimately a great role model for distrusting ALL authorities and proving things to yourself.His life reveals how many scientists these days are pretenders."
5,Delightful,"I don't think I have ever in my life used the word ""delightful"" to describe anything -- until now.This book is delightful. Feynman is a unique human being, and lived life in a way that we should all try to emulate. I wish I could have met the man, and even better taken a physics class from him.Buy this book, read it, and learn what you can from it."
5,One of the most comical autobiographies ever,"This book is extraordinarily funny, and not in a subtle or literary way. Quite simply it will have you rolling on the floor as the Nobel-laureate tells of his stint playing the frigideira (a sort of inverted metal pot) in a Brazilian school of Samba, of the time he was declared mentally unfit to serve in the army because he insisted he could sometimes hear voices in his head, or the time he serendipitoulsy pointed out a fatal flaw in the design of an uranium enriching facility even though he couldn't tell whether the symbols in the blueprints were valves or windows. Whether the stories he tells are all true or not, you have to admire Prof. Feynman's sheer inventiveness and his unmatched talent as a narrator and a humorist. A word of caution, however: a faithful movie adaptation of these memoirs would not be rated PG."
3,"Funny, but a little bit off-putting","Truth is sometimes funnier than fiction. This book proves it.Unfortunately there are a few parts this book could have done without. One chapter that starts out trying to sound anecdotal ends up making the point that women will only sleep with you if you treat them poorly. Other parts of the book make him sound incredibly pompus. For example, after taking an art class he complains about not being taken seriously as an artist because of his physics background. He brags about the fact that he brainstorms in seedy strip joints, apparently he thinks this makes him cool.It was too bad really, because there are a lot of funny things in this book."
4,The best Math teacher!,a little disjointed but very entertaining... Points well made about education in science and math. I have experienced them in this country and was aghast to see how impractical and not related to the real world the teaching was compared to the education in those subjects I received in Europe
3,Good in small doses,"It's just not as funny nor as interesting as the jacket blurbs led me to believe.Yes, there are some interesting stories, and he is a curious character, but I started scanning instead of reading after the halfway point. It is by no means a poor book, but a lot of his so called-adventures may leave you feeling ""so what?"""
4,Melissa Robbins' Review,"The novel, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"", by Richard Feynman was very interesting I must say. The numerous stories of events during his life were very comical and entertaining. Feynman's humorous tales of his ideas and experiences made it hard to put down. Although the book is written by a physicist, it is not your typical science book. It tells about the things Mr. Feynman did from his childhood all the way up to his life as an adult. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an enjoyable biography about a wonderfully successful physicist."
5,Bad boy Feynman,"The theoretical physicist and Nobel price winner Richard Feynman wrote thisbook in a bad boyish diary style, each chapter is independent and someinclude repeats of earlier descriped events from a slightly different viewpoint. Not only wasRichard a brilliant scientist, he was also a self-taught lockpicker(practicing this art in the time he worked for the Los Alamos project, opening ""top secret"" cabinets and safes,thereby upsetting the military commander), a prankster, a public admirer offemale beauty and a bongo player. In short, he loved live."
5,Excellent,I ordered two of these and they arrived quickly in great condition. This book was fun to read and it had many truths that I appreciated.
4,"""Funny, brilliant, bawdy""","Be prepared to meet Richard Feynman, learn about his drumming in a steel band, his cracking of safes, his portrait painting, and his very wise, and very humorous look at what goes into his life. Feynman pretty much excels at everything from radio-repair to philosophy. The book is an insight into his days as a child, at school, at MIT, at Los Alamos research center, at the nuclear research center during world war two, his non-existent social life and how he goes on to learn the tricks and become a social animal. It's really amazing how one man can play so many roles in one life. But one also admires that Feynman was absolutely committed to his subject with a no-nonsense attitude."
2,Bully,"Feynman was undeniably brilliant but he was also a bully and a supreme egotist. He recounts story after story of how he humiliated people, usually with cruel ""jokes."" I did not find him appealing at all."
3,In his own words,"Although I'd heard of Feynman for years now--people I know were excited by the Feynman Lectures volumes--I didn't really know who he was. Oh, I could probably have given you the fact that he was a physicist, and maybe that he had won the Nobel prize, and just recently Jill told me about a Feynman anecdote that she had read by Stephen Jay Gould. After Surely You're Joking, I know much more about Feynman, and why he interests people. As far from the stereotype of the scientist that you can get, yet still having some geeky characteristics that he wasn't afraid to admit to, Surely You're Joking is a portrait of the man in his own words. In fact, the best way to approach this book is as if you had stumbled on to it in a dimly-lit bar, sat down next to it, exchanging turns buying drinks and talking about each other. Just like a conversation, some things are funny, some things don't make sense, and--as a one-sided conversation--they all revolve around a singe subject."
2,Did'nt get it!,"While I have no doubt the author and his fans are enjoying themselves immensely, I simply didn't get it. No harm there. I wish them continued happiness and joy on all fronts!"
3,"I admire Feynman and liked the book, but...","While the first four or five CDs are engaging and (as Feynman would say) very interesting, I found the second half somewhat tedious. His comments on physics decrease steadily throughout the book and the last half is taken up with his adventures in nightclubs and playing music in Brazil.The voice talent is great -- he may not sound like Feynman but he reads the words like a highly intelligent 12-year-old boy, which captures Feynman perfectly."
5,a curious and exploring mind,"brings you into the mind of a genius, a man unimpressed with his given talents, but wanting to know the world around him..the art world the scientific world and the world of women and socitey"
5,Feynman at his Finest,"This book is by far the best non-technical science book. Period. You don't have to be a scientist to love the spirit of Richard Feynman. From discovering the behaviors of ants with sugar to his stints as an artist and musician, Feynman reminds us all that the world is still our playground, waiting to be discovered."
5,Just a Regular Guy,"Feynman had no desire for fame and fortune and was just interested in finding things out. That's what makes this book so entertaining. It shows that there is no value in pretending to be an expert or in holding a high position in your field of endeavor without just having fun learning and experiencing life. While Feynman was truely a great mathmatician and physicist and co-developer of the atomic bomb during WWII, this book shows some of his more human reactions and vulnerabilities we all share."
4,Quirky autobiographical account,"I liked this book so much that I bought a copy for my son. The book provides an insight into the workings of our scientific community as well as this particular scientist. Mr. Feynman's curiousity, persistence and intelligence demonstrated in his choices were inspiring. It's a great read."
5,This is a good book for anyone.,"I really love this book. It's a bunch of short stories about Richard Feynman's life. While he is best known for his work in physics, this book deals with the man and not the science. If you ever wanted to know how a genius thinks read this book. I never know a genius could be so average."
3,Very easy-to-follow introduction book to S-PLUS,"As advertised in the title, the book introduces thebasics of S-PLUS statistics software. The pace isgentle and very easy to follow. I particularly likethe chapter 2, Graphical User Interface, which iswritten in almost step-by-step manner and includesmore than 50 screen dumps. For R users the book doesinclude a chapter to discuss the differences."
4,Great for S-Plus novices!,"Just the right material to get started. Faithfully plod thru the exercises to get the necessary foundations, then move on to more detailed books like Carmona's, Venable's, etc."
1,Misrepresentation,"The product was mispresented. Mentions it is a 5000-sheet carton, but is only actually advertising one ream of paper for $17.45 plus shipping. Rip off!Needs to correct their ad."
1,Howdy Doody,"This doll was advertised as in good condition when in fact it was in poor condition. My lesson, just because it's cheaper doesn't mean it's worth it"
3,Cute,"Typical Doll. Plastic, not a great body or cloths but what you would expect for a starter Ventriloquist doll for a kid."
4,jet kit for V&H exhaust,"Made a huge difference for the better ran much better, still needs a little tweeking. Could use better detailed instructions."
5,Best Cookie sheet ever!,"Purchased the Doughmakers pizza pan years ago at a craft show...then regretted that I didn't purchase more. To my surprise, I was thrilled that I found them on the internet. Just wish I would have purchased more. No need for grease sprays as nothing sticks to it. No need to scour the pan as it washes off easily. Great pans."
5,Excellant product.,I wanted something small for my convection oven. Fits perfect. Cookies baked great.
3,I'm Still Looking,"This pan is nothing special. I baked some biscuits on it, and they didn't stick, but that's about all. A long time ago I found a pan, about this size, at Target, and it had both the pebbled texture AND the insulation. I went back to get another one...but there weren't any, and I've never found another one anywhere. That is the best pan I've ever used. Nothing sticks, and nothing burns. It might get very crisp if you leave it in too long, but it doesn't burn. I even looked up the patent # on the back (there isn't a brand name), but all it tells me is that it's a pebbled-textured, insulated cookie sheet."
1,its ok,i really dint like this product you can tell that you are wearing extensions the cap is too big ... i think it will be good for people that have alot of hair. i have thin hair :(
5,"22"" Straight Clip-In Hair Extensions by Jessica Simpson hairdo - R4","I love this product, it looks so natural and adds to my length when I just want to go out. Its easy to use and I highly recommend this item."
1,Could not even wear it once!!!!,"Never ever buy synthetic hair!!! I learned my lesson, the hair feels fake looks fake and its no surprise bc it is FAKE! I guess it's my fault for expecting it to live up to real hair. It tangles easily, its very heavy to wear, you cant even brush it without ruining it and it does not blend in at all!!! DO not buy do not waste your money, i went to the youtube reviews and they talk wonders about this hair but later i realized that all those people were being paid by the company to promote it so dont buy into that. If you need extensions spend on good quality remy hair not this crap!"
3,"Very thin, tangles alot",i purchased before this one the 16 inch layered and it has much more hair than this one. This one tangles very easily.
4,Great customer service,"I ordered the wrong color by mistake and they were great about returning them. While I was waiting for the new ones to ship, I was second guessing my color choice again. I contacted the seller and they let me change to a different. I was a huge pain and they were more than understanding. The em tensions are okay. Nothing too great but worth the amount I paid."
1,Don't buy it!,"I have bought numerous things on Amazon and this product is so bad I felt compelled enough to write a review. I bought the long piece in Sandy Blonde. I have long thin hair. You can clip it in ok, but the cap is so large it was hard for my hair to hide completely. And the length of extensions that is exposed was very phony and costumey looking. I think this piece might work if you have a large head and thick hair--but if you have thick hair who needs an extension? I am VERY DISAPPOINTED it is not returnable, a total waste of money."
2,@vmax man,And that's Amazon's fault how? Maybe she should have done her research and found the best price before ordering. Just saying.
5,Elegant and comfortable,"Lovely, comfortable, good for walking, with very flexible rubber soles, which are hard to find in classy shoes. I think they run big -- long and wide - so if you're thinking about ordering the narrow (I wasn't sure) go ahead and do it."
3,NOT TOO MUCH NEW HERE,"Anyone who is familiar with Pink Floyd knows their story. It's been printed often enough, so there is nothing new here in that regard.Having said that, I would recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen any of this info and for the interviews contained within, especially the ones from David Gilmour as you get areal sense of who he is as a person."
3,A Beginners' Guide,"A lot of material in this was banal for me as I have been a collector for years. If you are just starting out with your interest in Native American jewelry, I would suggest this book. It is easy to understand and the pix are good."
2,indian guide to jewlry,nothen like i expected tiniest book ever few pages with 1 pic on each very disappointed and waste of money
2,A Guide To Indian Jewelry of the Southwest,"The information provided in this book just gave a taste of the Indian jewelry art form. It was a quick learn into understanding various art techniques. However, the book should have expanded on the basics and explored the art form in more depth."
3,Early writings of Tozer,"I found this book awkward to read as Tozer was just learning his writing skills. If you have read much Tozer you will automatically see how Tozer has advanced in writing skills through the years. I am a huge Tozer fan. I have, at least I think I do, all of Tozer's books; his complete library. I gave it 3 Stars because of the over emphasis he used while trying to tell the story of A. B. Simpson. It's a good book, but it was written in1943 before Tozer gained his great literary skills. If you read the book, I think you will agree."
4,Great Little Bio of A.B. Simpson,Does it get any better than this? One solid Bible preacher writing about another. This is an oldie but goodie - written about 1948 I think. Interesting insight into the challenges facing Simpson approx. 100 years ago; also laced through with that unspoken reminder that God never changes regardless of what year it is.
3,Not the Best Dead Calendar,"This calendar is disappointing from several standpoints. The photos are older and less clear than previous calendars, and the graphics tend to obscure the actual days and dates on the calendar. On the plus side, their are some interesting quotes."
1,"Poorly written, potentially dangerous","The author of ""How to Get Wealthy Writing Informational Books for the Internet"", also the author of this book, should be stopped. The information presented was only minimally specfic for epilepsy and included recommendations for relaxation, self-improvement, diet, exercise, etc. that one suspects will come out from the same author for a multitude of other diagnoses. One of the first recommendations for relaxation was to take a warm bath. Most neurologists warn against taking a bath alone because of the risk of drowning if a seizure occurs. The many grammar and spelling mistakes leads me to believe no editors or spellcheckers ever got near this manuscript. There are many books on the topic that are better than this one."
2,may have clogged my printer,"I can't say how most of the inks work, because when I used the black and cyan cartridges my printer stopped working! I can't say for sure that it was this product that clogged my printer, but it stopped working shortly after I changed to these cartridges. I had used these inks before and the only problem was they didn't last as long as the Canon cartridges, and diminished the photo quality a bit. This time I couldn't get the clog out, so it was cheaper to get a new printer than to have my Pixma fixed. I'm sticking with the brand name inks in my new printer."
2,Poor print quality,The photo prints with these inks are horrible. The prints using the original Canon ink were of excellent quality. Will not be purchasing these inks again.
4,Great way to protect clothes.,"I loved these bibs. Over 3 years of toddlers, I have bought the denim pattern, 2 pink ones and 2 blue ones.The only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of the 5 is the cleaning of them. After about 8 months of almost daily use it gets smelly. No amount of soaking in bleach will clean it. The bacteria, mold, mildew OR whatever it was got into the seams. That is why I bought so many. After 8-10 months of use I would throw away and buy another. Usually by that time the velcro wasn't adhering either.I found this a much better choice for total coverage than anything else I could find."
1,Sold a dud!,"I'd love to rate this and having recently played the course was looking forward to being reminded of the events that unfolded there. But it appears a ""Universal"" region won't play on my DVD player and I have yet to resolve this either with the vendor or with the DVD player. If indeed a Universal DVD won't play in the US that is deeply frustrating and I particular as I should have been warned by the vendor (many items do show this but I am not sure if this did)."
2,Should have been better..,"This was actually a disappointing CD, Lito is a pretty good lyricist and so Polaco is better then he is, but there just was no quality to the production on the project. And the rhymes were surprisingly week. There are two worth while tracks and I literally mean worth while."
3,Seriously over rated here,"Just taking the Opus 131 as an example, this is a good transfer, with adequate playing if on the lush side, but it hardly scratches, let alone plumbs the intellectual depths of this piece. Compare the sul ponticello work with the Julliard's for an obvious example of the shallow depth of the interpretation.This kind of reviewing, coupled with the price asked, calls for some serious caveat, both with respect to this recording and the reliability of the reviews here."
5,Thanks god that amazon had this in stock,"I had a special install that needed a 3/8 OD by 3/8 OD and for the life of me, no local store has it in stock. Not Homedepot, Lowes, Ace, no one. Good price and super easy to install and operate. Thanks."
5,"Wakker, wakes you up!","Volumia, is a dutch group which excist out of 9 people. Their lead singer is called Xander. The album has 12 songs and I was looking out for the CD a long time. My favourite song on the album is ""Hoe lang heb ik te leven"" which is dedicated to a friend of the group (on of the members) who suffered from cancer. It makes you realize that you have to enjoy life every day. The big hit here in Holland is ""Blijf bij mij"", which has a great ritme. Wakker is a mix of ballads and songs with ritme. A great song if you are into Nederpop and Dutch music!"
5,Customer Service,"I ordered from The Wok Shop and made a mistake while ordering. I was very worried about the problem. I received the kindest e-mail from the company and all was solved. I have not recieved my Wok since I ordered it yesterday, but am looking forward to it. This company truly understands GREAT customer service."
4,Que Saboroso!,"This is a fantastic cookbook for people with an interest in Latin cooking. There are also more modern takes on traditional recipes, which makes it easier, as well, to eat healthier (avoiding some of the fats, etc.). I lived in Latin America for many years, and this is the gift that I give to friends who are heading out to the Spanish speaking world. I guarantee them that they, and their friends, will use it over and over again."
1,Pèsimo !,"Un recetario que quiere ser dos cosas ( español e inglès ) y no es ninguna de las dos...ni recetario,. tampoco"
1,painful as a root canal,"well, it's informative but horrible. it is written in a disgusting fashion. liora a. cohen should be ashamed. i was a fool to even open it. i regret that day like i regret the day i lost my puppy dog. i miss my puppy dog just like i miss being able to cook in english and spanish without thinking about ms. cohen and her work of terror."
4,Very nice kayak,"I have always wanted to have my own kayak but did not want to take up all that space in my garage. Bought the convertible this week and spent the day on it with my family at the lake today. Loved it. I didnt put the back bone in correct so the kayak leaned to one side but we still had a great time on it. It didnt take much to fill it up with air and setup was a breeze. The kayak is comfortable and extremely stable. The material is tough and stood up to the elements well. After a day on the water, I deflated the kayak and cleaned it before packing it away...no problems at all. A couple of recommendations. 1. Get a backbone, its worth the money and adds stiffness to the kayak. 2. Unpack your new kayak and set it up at your home and get familiar with the process. 3. Bring a tarp to set underneath your new kayak for setup so not to cause unnecessary damage. Enjoy!"
5,Incredible Kayak,"This is a very strong and well made kayak. Doesn't require a trailer or roof rack to transport so can be taken just about anywhere. Sets up and packs up quickly. Fits two adults and two children if needed but also works well when converted to one person. It is fast, and can keep up with or beat hard shell kayaks too. I'd definitely buy it again and recommend this purchase to others."
4,AE Kayak,"Worked exactly as promoted. Easy to fill. Fills nice and tight. The bulk of the fill can be done with a 12 volt air pump (use a cheap, weak pump so as not to over inflate), but you will need a foot pump to tighten things up. The air pump speeds up the fill process. I was worried that once it hit cool water it might lose pressure. Not the case, stayed tight in the water, and maintained its shape when loaded with weight (people). It is not a fast kayak, but it is surprisingly comfortable and easy to maneuver. The supplied seats work well with sufficient back support. It is heavier than I thought it would be. Not a problem for two people, but difficult to launch for one person."
3,disappointed,"My first mistake was not checking the date...I would've like a more recently published version better. Also, I just don't like the way it is set up. I expected ""lists"" to be easier to read through and make decisions from, but, it's actually a little confusing. Disappointed."
4,Travel Pro - Very Happy,"I'm very happy with this little guitar. I chose it to learn how to play. I wanted something that would be easy to pick up and play anytime and wouldn't be any trouble taking it with me on trips. This guitar has met all of my requirements. It trully is very quiet when you strum the guitar but not if you pick it. I haven't been able to use the stethophone as my guitar did not include it and I'm working with the vendor to get one. The stethophone should be included. Tuning is very easy and the tuners work smoothly. Overall workmanship is very good. I'm only rating this as four stars because this is a Chinese made guitar. I couldn't locate the country of manufacturing in any production information before I purchased, and I took a chance. I felt for $349 dollars I wouldn't get a Chinese made guitar, but I guess these days even at that price your still going to get one. This is just a peeve of mine, does everything have to be made in China these days? UGH!"
1,Very Dissappointed,"From the first time we used this cartridge it left a large noticeable gray stripe in the center of each page. The large stripe didn't go away with cleaning unless you count one copy and then by the second one it was back. The cartridge is well use with nicks and other cosmetic flaws that also might be affecting its performance. We didn't start using this cartridge until the return date had expired. It was the cheapest one we found, but totally unusable so money thrown away. Proceed with caution."
2,HP Laser JET Cartdridge C3903A,"Product came on time but if I didn't know that this cartdrige was just purchased, I would say it is running out of ink. It is very light and I consider this product as unsatisfactory.Leo L"
3,First time user of this product,"Overall I'm pretty pleased with this cartridge. This is the first time I've used something other than the HP cartridges -- at $100 a pop! Have not really had a big job to do yet to put it through its paces, but it seems to be working just fine except for one little issue: For the first printing of a document every day, I notice a light smudge that runs the length of the paper on the left 1/3 of the sheet. It's not enough to really create a problem, or for me to even trash the page, and it disappears after a couple of pages have gone through, but I have not had that problem with the HP cartridges I've used in the past. I'm willing to continue to use this and am curious to see if I will be able to get 4000 copies off of it."
5,subhumans all gone live dvd,this as been one of my favorite band my whole life. i saw them live in the 80's and on their reunion. i love this dvd and this band. they thought me a lot of good things to have in my life. i highly recomend (spelling?) them. if you do like subhumans already please check out citizen fish. this is dicks second band. dick is the singer for subhumans and citizen fish. they were making punk music in england before it was on the radio.
2,Suffering the Loss?,"I would definatly say we're suffering a loss. A loss in change of sound. Each song is very very very similar to the last. Talented maybe, but not too good with varying sounds."
1,"Looks good for the price, but its not quality","I beg to differ on this blind. Immediately when I took it out of the box it looked fine. I set it up and two seams broke make the blind totally unfunctional. Also there was patches inside the blind like it had been torn and patched. It would look like a nice blind if it didn't break. Also, take down was horrible and broke a couple more things. Waste of my money. I now know to actually buy quality and spend and extra dollar for a double bull or high quality ameristep."
5,Hunter's View Blind Sniper Camo,"Great quality product at a fair price! Set's up in minutes and comfortably seats me and my son. Ideal for turkey and deer hunting. Camo pattern looks great, blind disappears!"
2,Dullish melancholia,"2 1/2This is a little too flimsy, lacking the degree of subtle flux needed to keep me engaged throughout Glass and his sometimes tedious excursions into repetition. The result is classy boredom."
1,Repetition,"This is a repetition of published work. If your Glass collection is serious, check out the titles of the songs before you order this cd"
2,Music for the gym?,"With its minimalistic, repetitive chords and rhythms, the music in these pieces contains little in the way of traditional ""development."" This music progresses by flowing along rather than by forming an elaborate structure. As I listen, I feel as if I'm on a treadmill, sometimes walking faster, sometimes slower, but not really getting anywhere. My mind wanders, and I find myself thinking about other things rather than about the music. Perhaps this is how Glass wanted it to be. He has written a lot of film music, and much of his music does, indeed, seem like accompaniment.This is not unpleasant music. But I find it something less than totally rewarding--seems more like the composition of a amateur."
5,marvelous composer,"It makes me happy that I can hear what Phillip Glass heared when he composed the music, there are feelings of mystery and nostalgy."
4,"music from ""Thin Blue LIne""","I bought the soundtrack to Errol Morris' film assuming it was Philip Glass'@memorable score, but unfortunately there was alot of dialog from the film. Solo Piano, however, is simply Glass with a piano playing compositions from his film score. A wonderful surprise and a must- have for any errol morris fan."
5,Excellent Introduction to OffBeat Poetry,"I picked this book up for the second time recently and am looking forward to rereading the personalized biographies of the poets whom I have since gotten to know such as Bob Kaufman and William Everson. Aside the big names like Ginsberg and Bukowski are lesser known but very reputable poets like James Broughton and Phillip Lamantia. Cherkovski introduces them each with personal stories, poetry excerpts, biographical accounts and his own take on why they are direct descendents of Whitman. Highly recommended for those who want to know more poets that generally speaking belonged to the Beat Canon. Cherkovski's work is accessible, intelligent and humorous. Support local bookstores if you can."
5,I LOVE THIS SET,This cd set is one of the most stylistically diverse I have EVER seen. CD 1 is fantastic Euro dance music that'll make you wanna shake your arse. CD 2 will take you on a trance-hypnotic journey to rival Oaky and PVD. The flow is a perfect mesh of peaks and valleys that will have you doing the raver kick step for hours. CD 3 is a bonus cd by Graeme Park (hadn't heard of him) and he has a unique style of mixing Euro dance that is unlike anyone else I've heard.
5,Pure Quality,The first CD has to be one of my all time favourites. All of the songs blend together perfectly with outstanding tracks being Big Love and (You got me) Burning up. Although the first CD is superior from a complete CD perspective the second CD although not having the same fluency still contains some great songs. Greece 2000 and Crazy simply jump out at you and scream for the stereo to be turned up. The addition of the bonus CD should sway any undecided minds and you should get out there and buy this NOW!
4,Great Green Tea,Dragonwell green tea tastes differently depending on who produces it. The aroma of Foojoy's green tea is mouth watering. The flavor is full but not bitter.
3,Great Tea but over priced,"I purchase this tea at a local Vietnamese grocery store for $5.99 a box (100 bags). It is one of my favorite teas with a wonderful flavor, but this price of over $10 a box is excessive."
1,May Be Better Used As Activated Carbon Bags,"For those who sincerely want to try some Chinese tea or Oriental green tea, I personally recommend you to avoid this product or indeed any kinds of tea bags of green tea.I thought this might be a product containing 100 individual bags of loose leaf but it turned out to be 100 bags of tea ashes.The taste is so weird that you cannot even believe it could ever be dragonwell tea: it tastes like the worst kind of faked Chinese tea being mixed with Korean barley tea.Oops, after suffering from this terrible cup of tea for no more than 10 minutes, I decided to use all those tea bags as individually wrapped bags of activated carbon: something used to absorb the dirty and nasty air in your room, and fortunately, they really work...as bags of activated carbon, but not tea!!!"
2,"FOOJOY LUNGCHING...I MISSED THE ""JOY"" PART","I thought that I would try out this product, since i've tried a number of green teas, and after trying this I was not at all impressed with it by any means. I don't recommend this product...there was no kind of ""flavor"" to this to me, and i've been all over the orients. Just my opinion, but hope someone else enjoys it better than I did."
1,sewer seal,would not recommend it is to hard a stiff to seal around your hose in a RV should be a softer sponge material
1,costs way too much !,This same sewer hose seal sells for $2.95 at Wallmart. Why does it cost $7.95 online?? why the big jump in price ? Someone is making WAY too much money on this item.
4,I liked this book...,"Good book. It tells you alot about how Hitler got to power and his defeat and his craziness is unsurpassed. If you like books about WW2 and the Holocaust, you will love this one. It makes me sympathize all the more with the Jews, and makes me dislike the Germans because of their indifference to the Jews deaths and tortures. Shame on them....I know there were good Germans that tried to help, and I can understand fear can keep people from helping those that are helpless, but they worshiped this man and that is why Ive always been angry toward the people of this Era, why did they let it happen, they could have stopped it in the beginning before he got to power. ...Well do read the book as i highly recommend it."
5,Another great Hopla DVD for older toddlers,"Hopla is terrific. It's my little niece and nephew's favorite new series. They are 3 and 4, and they just LOVE these DVDs. They get so excited about all of the matching games and their favorite is the ""predicting"" parts. (An object slowly starts to form and gives the kids ""clues."" My kiddos go crazy yelling out guesses while the object materializes. So fun!)I wish there were more of them!!"
5,One of the best,"I would say this is Mr. Glass' best work. The songs are simply beautiful. The orchestration is rich and complex, yet gives a tranquil quality. I highly recommend this album."
5,Great introduction to the music,ArckivMusic shows 146 recordings of the music of Phillip Glass available on its site. (Not that you shouldn't shop here).This is a great place to start. The music from Akhnaten is just beautiful -- especially the Hymn to the Sun.
1,"Horrible ""documentry""",I'd say less than 5 minutes of northern lights footage. Few details of the cause of the lights provided. Movie seemed low budget with no purpose.
4,Well done,"The documentary was well done overall. The first few minutes would have been better placed elsewhere in the film - the train ride north voiceover would have been great. That is what caught me, and held my attention throughout the movie to the close."
5,I LOVE LESTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love my lester doll I got him for christmas he is an awesome companian he is very easy to operate you will just fall in love with lester he is awesome he looks scary in the picture but when you get him you will notice that he has a very friendly face overall I give this doll 5 stars he is fun and you will love your lester doll very much you will start to notice that he will become part of your family you will forget about your homework and focus on ventriloquism [trust me it happened to me]I encourage you to ask your mom and dad for lester he is one of my very best friends infact some of my friends are getting a little jealous because when they call me on the phone they ask what i am doing I say oh nothing just hangin with lester it about drives my friends crazy
1,JUST FOR INEXPERIENCE CHILDREN TO LOOK AT,"I had one as a child and I don't remember the string being this tight. You got to practically wrap one hand around it's throat and pull with the other. I also don't like the way the eyes are painted on. They'd be ok, if they didn't look up and left. I've watched a lot of ventriloquist work and it's much more entertaining when it looks like the dummy is engaging the audience. So, the eyes should be painted looking in that direction. Painting them left also assumes that the user is right handed"
5,"Two superb but underexposed albums from ""The Iceman"".","Perhaps because they were both released at a time when disco ruled the charts these two albums' sales figures were dismal--the material on both, however, was nothing short of glorious and superb. Jerry Butler's reunion with Gamble and Huff resulted in some great Philly Soul with gorgeous numbers like ""Let's Make Love"", ""Angel Face"", ""Would You Mind?"", ""Don't Be An Island"" and both the disco and slow-tempo versions of ""Nothing Says I Love You Like I Love You"" being key cuts."
1,Say what??!!,"I flat out do not understand the reviews that have been submitted so far. I purchased this double album on the basis of them, and I'm mad. I'm just a few years younger than Jerry Butler, and I've been a fan all my life. (From Chicago, too.) I have never before listened to an album of his that had nothing--zip, nada--on it that I came even close to liking. This is a practical joke of an album: there's that beautiful voice, singing two collections of songs without any redeeming features. There are boring melodies, dragging tempos, limp rhythms. Was Jerry in the midst of a contract dispute? You wouldn't even use these songs to pad out an LP in the old-fashioned way. If there are samples you can hear, listen to them before buying this album, then step away and look for some of the out-of-print collections from this period of his career. You'll be glad you did."
5,fun!,"My 6 yr. olds loves this game and does as well as his Dad. It is compact and easy to take places where we might have to wait for a long time, such as doctors or dentist waiting rooms. I love games that make you think."
4,L.A. Road Rage without the guns,This is an addictive (and frustrating!) little game. It's a favorite in our household and has many different cards so all ages and all levels can play it. Also a great educational toy that will make your child logically think out solutions while having a great time. I highly recommend this game!!
5,Satisfied Customer,This product is being used by a homeschooling mom to stimulate my childs thought process prior to starting our academics for the day. It is also used as a game because my children love it so much. I must take it from my husband sometimes so the kids can play. We have loaned it and recommended it to many of our friends.
5,Loved it!,"I bought this for my 5th grade son and he loved it so much, he went through all the levels in one night! His college graduate sister loved it too, they were taking turns playing this game. He can't wait for me to buy him more cards (if they're available). I will definitely buy the other rush hour games.This game is good practice for spacial reasoning too!"
4,awesome fun--for all ages,"this item rocks!!! it is fun and you can play it forever! its also addictive! if you get board with your parents driving through a traffic jam--play you own. i dont own this biut i played it froever at my cousins house. you can play tis at any age because there are easy and hard stuff! im 11, my cousin is 9 and her brother is 7 and we all had a great time playing!"
5,ThinkFun Rush Hour,I have purchased this game many times in the past as a gift for young friends and relatives. It always is received happily and enjoyed by the children and adults as well. I realize I now have a slight gap in the age of youngsters and will have to pause a year or two before presenting this as a gift again. This comes as good news for me as the extra game I have kept on hand for an available gift can now be mine. I will put it out for visitors to pick up and enjoy in my home. That is the way I originally discovered this treasure!
5,Great For Kids and Adults,"This game ranks high on my gift list both for birthdays and holidays. It is engaging for children AND adults. It works well at home as well as road and plane trips. It keeps older minds sharp and agile as well as helping develop the minds of children. While targeted towards being played solo, it can easily be adapted for play with two or more individuals in a kind of group-solving format.For a variation from using the cards, our family creates traffic jam scenarios of our own, and we take turns solving them. I really like doing this as our grandchildren have to add extra analytical skills by reversing their logic and problem solving.Kudos to those who created this game!"
5,Educational - fun - interactive,This is a wonderful toy for a child to play alone or with others. Stimulating to the intellect and fun at the same time. I gave it to my stepdaughter when she was 5 and 2 years later she's still excited with it. Great gift!
5,Good for old and young,"I got this for my 9-year-old son for Christmas...and have been ""playing"" with it myself. It's a great short-term solitaire puzzle, that has the potential to keep my mind sharpened and thinking ahead. Oh yeah, he seems to like it, too, as does my 16-year-old!"
4,"Superb Game, But With One Problem!","I really want to give this four an a half stars. This game is one of the best one player games I have evry played. It's a mind bending, heart pounding, fun but hard game. The only problem is you have to save the box that it came in if you don't want to lose your cars and trucks. Still this is a really really cool, fun, challenging game to play. END"
4,Xmas gift....enjoyed,This was a Christmas gift and when talking with the family they said they (the kids) were enjoying it very much.
5,When a traffic jam on the expressway isn't enough...,"This is a fun game for all ages. The early levels are simple enough for even younger children to play and win. The later levels can be quite a challenge for adults! The object of the game is to get the red car out of traffic and into the clear. Each scenario is different and there are additional packs of cards available from the manufacturer (when you finish the expert level). For those of us who get frustrated easily, the answer key is on the back of each card. This is a game that can be played alone or in a group (try using a timer to see who finishes a card first). It helps to teach how to think in a logical fashion."
4,In a jam,"You're in a parking lot,trying to reach the lone exit.You see it,race up,and there comes a big truck.A giant hand,your hand,moves it and you're outta there.Seems unreal,unless you're playing Rush Hour.The red car,you,must get out of the parking lot filled with vehicles.You slide them around until you can get the red car out.The you start over with another card.It is a little bit hard,so I think you should be at least 7 or 8 to try this stratigic,mini road rage of a game"
4,Educational and fun,"My grandson played this game at school and thought it was really great. He said he would like one of his own, so we ordered it to be included in his Easter basket. He was thrilled. It creates imagination and thinking to perform this game."
1,The worst game ever!,"Although this game appears fun to the naked eye, that is just a gimmic. This game has no educational value whatsoever! It is a waste of money and useful plastic."
5,Great fun and awesome game!!!,"My husband and I gave this game to our daughter for Christmas. When she first unwrapped the present she looked uninterested. Later that day she pulled it out and asked what it was about. We got it out and tried it out. Instantly she was hooked as was I. This game is really a great game, but it is also a wonderful educational product. It truly teaches thinking skills and as a homeschool parent I can truly appreciate that. I highly recommend this for anyone regardless of where or how your children are schooled!!!!"
5,Amazing! Simply amazing!,"The only thing I can think to improve this toy is to make the cars and trucks a little heavier so they don't thither easily. But what an amazing thinking toy! It is not just a toy that you buy, play for a while, and store forever. It has a great repeat playability. Toys that don't encourage you to think is a waste of money; not this.The puzzles are very challenging; even with the beginner cards, I got stuck for a while on number 7 or 8 before passing to the next level. Both of my sons are enjoying this, especially my 7-year-old son who has mild autism. He is now tackling the advance levels.Worth the money.Just be careful not to lose a piece."
5,one person challenging puzzle game,A one person puzzle game which is continually more challenging the deeper into the levels you go.
5,Mind Absorbing Traffic Chaos!,"I got the chance to try out this fabulous game during the Christmas holidays and it was actually given to me by my Canadian mother-in-law. Not being able to resist the challanges of the different card categories I started off with the top-level, but soon had to give up and step level by level down. Solving the cards one by one gave a real kick to continue up-wards in the card categories. Playing the game during my in-laws Christmas dinner, I stole the show from my mother-in-law's great Christmas food. Everyone invited could hardly wait for their turn to try to get the litlle red car out of the parking lot, giving me tips and advice and completly forgetting the food! That goes also for my mother-in-law! END"
4,Rush Hour Review,We really like the game. Our son's Occupational Therapist recommended it. It makes the kids think and they all love it.
5,Rushhour instead of video games!,"Hours of entertainment! It was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old, and on Christmas night, he passed up Bakugan and Bey Blade toys,video games, and even his laptop just to play Rushhour! As he showed us what to do and how to play, we all wanted to play more and more (ages 8, 31, and 62). It really encourages critical thinking in a simple, but oh-so-clever way!"
5,BUY IT NOW!,"I am a homeschool mom. I am fussy about what my kids spend time on. Railroad Rush Hour is FUN and it makes the mind think sequentially, logically, spacially, creatively and more. I have four kids. My only warning is that one of these games in the household is not enough. I paid twice this price in a retail shop. Now I can order another from Amazon. By the way, I have to disagree with the age recommendation. My 3 and 5 year olds did all ten ""Junior Traffic Jams"" in one day! They are up to the #12 card now. Meanwhile, my 9 and 10 years olds are still challenged on the upper cards and I enjoy the 30's. It's for all ages. Never under estimate what small children can do. Their brains are actually superior in their ability to learn than the rest of us over age 7. BUY THIS GAME NOW!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST!,"I got this for my son two Christmas' ago. Boy, does he LOVE it. He has mastered all the cards, but still goes back to the game. It will really keep your child busy. He was 6 when I purchased it and now at 8 years old it is one of his favorites. My 6 year old is next to get it. Absolute loved game. A must have for a childs collection. You can't go wrong with this one."
5,Glad I Discovered This,"I came across this toy by accident and found out it is an award winner made in 2005. It is so much fun. Not only does my grandson enjoy it but I love it as well. I have since ordered the extra 3 card packs which are progressively more difficult. I have also ordered an extra game so my grandson can have his own personal game. It is a single player game so with him having his own we can play against each other, who finishes first. I also ordered Rush Hour Jr. for my grandaughter. This game is challenging for adults and children and I must admit my 9 year old grandson is better at it than I am. I see that it can travel well because it has its own pouch and an edge around it so it cannot easily tip over. I really love playing this game and am not sure who enjoys it more--my grandson or me!"
3,Not the best game...,"I got this game as more of a Novelty, it is very glitchy in my opinion and if you don't know how to duck then you woln't get far... Have Fun!"
3,Average,"I'm a big fan of Daikatana on the PC and I never played the N64 version. I pop it in and off the bat you can notice that the levels are set in the same places but laid entirely different. The game is okay and is some good, short fun for your N64 (I completed the game in under 5 hours and I'm not very good at games on consoles).Daikatana 64 has some quirks though: The framerate can come to a crawl during the cutscenes, during the cutsceens the sidekicks show up but the game makes no mention of them elsewhere, you keep your weapons between episodes, the Daikatana is not a playable weapon, the wizard boss on episode 3 is a little too hard and the rest are too easy and the music continuously loops per episode which can become annoying.Despite these flaws, the game is only worth a few measly bucks so you might as well add it to your collection and finish it in an afternoon. The controls are smooth and the game doesn't have many unfair moments with cheap shots."
3,So-so game,"This game is hard to use. If you want pencil marks, it just puts all of them in. This basically gives you the answer as all you have to do is look for a square with only one number in it. I'm also disappointed that you have to insert the CD to play the game. This means that I will not be using it much. The only thing that saved the rating is the Mahjong, which is the main reason I bought it. Valusoft's earlier versions of Mahjong were better and easier to use in my opinion. There has to be better versions of Sudoku and Mahjong available."
3,"Easy to install, but not as effective as I'd hoped","I've had this installed for about 3 weeks now, and although it was very easy to install, I am not too impressed with how it's working. I'm still getting the same brownish buildup inside the toilet bowl itself, albeit a little less than before installation. I'm also disappointed that I can still smell the product, even though the Bromine is supposed to be near odorless. I'm giving it three stars because of the reduction in buildup in the bowl, and because of how easy it was to install. However, if given the choice, I would not buy this again."
2,Not 'Never Scrub',"Here at home,hard water leaves yellow rings around the toilet bowls. This product did not remove or even reduce the rings, even with scrubbing. Tile Away was the product that actually worked - Not NeverScrub Automatic Toilet Cleaning System. It was ineffective and a waste of money.Your AMAZON advertising made it sound as if this NeverScrub System was the perfect solution to automatically cleaning the toilet bowls. It never hapened.I ordered two systems along with refills from AMAZON. I am now stuck with the product plus the refills."
5,Awesome,"We live on a well with lots of iron. This thing is incredible! It keeps the toilets so clean. It cuts down tremendously on scrubbing. There is no ring in the bowl, now. We tried one as a experiment. Now we are hooked, and put them in all the toilets! Love it!!!!!"
3,"It works, it smells","The system works as expected, however the chlorine smell is overpowering. Not only is there a pretty strong odor in the bathroom, but if you so much as leave the door to the bathroom ajar the entire area nearby will smell of chlorine. Personally after trying it in one of my bathrooms I chose to switch over to Kaboom's version."
5,Outstanding Learning Program; Quick shipment~,"I knew exactly what I was ordering as far as the ""Bass Lesson Set"" by RoyV. If you are here and thinking about ordering this then you are serious about your musical path. Believe me when I say that this is a minor investment for what you are getting and the best thing is you can always go back to the lessons later down the road. Not that using instructors are a bad thing but like anything else it is a roll of the dice, this is the sure thing. I actually paid three times as much as this investment on instructors in the past six months! By no measure this is more organized and flows the best of any program of its sort. Life is short, get off the bench and join the game!Oh yeah, btw the product was shipped and arrived super fast!"
5,Great DVD learning tool,This is a fantastic set of DVD's for learning the bass guitar. The instruction is very clear and the lessons are well organized. Highly recommend for someone wanting to learn the bass on their own.
5,Ben lee this is all class!,"Cigarettes will kill you, the single, makes for a brilliant listening. A beautiful take of Bob Dylan's ""youre gonna make me lonsome when you go"" which was produced by Ben and Danny Mardorsky, is perfect for those quiet evenings alone.This song rates up there with ""Birthday song"" , its not quite as good , but is close. ""Girls talk"" also is a ""borrowed"" song from Ben , taken from Elvis Costello.Also a good song. If you are a true Ben Lee Fan you will by this single."
4,Wonder world of telecommunication around you,"The book, in my opinion, will be useful to the people not having a technical education and working in sphere of telecommunications and allied industries; for the beginners, wishing to expand the knowledge; for the employees responsible for administration of telecommunication services of the organizations; for managers on sales, marketing, management of projects, and also telecommunication managers and managers of a high level."
4,Excellent Telecom Overview,"As an industry outsider with limited technical experience, I found this book informative, easy-to-follow, and entertaining. My compliments to the author for a job well done."
5,WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF ALL 38 RAGS,"This is a wonderful collection of Scott Joplin's rags. It includes all the sheet music covers in black and white, and the music itself is a copy from the original publishers' edition for all 38 of Joplin's rags, plus the School of Ragtime. Any ragtime fan should have this book! Here's a complete list of the pieces in this book: Original Rags, Maple Leaf Rag, Swipesy, Sunflower Slow Drag, Peacherine Rag, The Easy Winners, The Strenuous Life, The Ragtime Dance, A Breeze From Alabama,Elite Syncopations, The Entertainer, Something Doing, Weeping Willow, Palm Leaf Rag, The Favorite, The Sycamore, The Cascades, Leola, Eugenia, Gladiolus Rag, Searchlight Rag, The Nonpareil, Rose Leaf Rag, Heliotrope Bouquet, School of Ragtime, Fig Leaf Rag, Sugar Cane, Wall Street Rag, Pine Apple Rag, Country Club, Paragon Rag, Stoptime Rag, Euphonic Sounds, Felicity Rag, Kismet Rag, Scott Joplin's New Rag, Magnetic Rag, Reflection Rag,and Silver Swan Rag."
1,Hijacked Title!! Get the original copy instead!,"Copy and paste (at the Amazon search box) these ISBNs for the original books: 0871042762 ""Complete Works"" or 0871042428 ""Collected Works"". You get twice as many Joplin pieces plus loads of biographical and other information!! They were first published by the New York Public Library by Vera Brodsky Lawrence. ""Complete Works"" is the later edition having 3 additional Joplin rags discovered since ""Collected Works"" was published."
5,Complete Piano Rags by Scott Joplin,This is excellent and well written music of Scott's Rag's. It contains all the good rags. It does not contain some of the waltz's and marches such as the Rose Bud March that is in the other book I highly recommend: (Scott Joplin Best or Ragtime Piano Solos). It can be ordered through Amazon. Excellent! Check out the Sedalia Missouri ragtime festivel around the first of June each year. It is wonderful.
5,Should be the 2nd Book on your Marijuana Book List,"This book is a very deep marijuana learning experience.It is exactly right for anyone who wants to know everything about the marijuana plant. This is a scientific book but not so hard to understand. I would think this book is not just for growers but for anyone interested in the plant.It has advanced growing information and some really interesting facts and seed banks, cloning and maybe things not really talked about much outside of private circles. I have seen stuff in this book that I have not elsewhere. It is a gem if you really want a unique understanding of marijuana.I say it is the 2nd Book on your list because like the other reviewer said you should get his other book first if you want to grow. But I see many owning this one also. It is well worth the price for the amount of information."
5,Beautiful and Powerful!,"""I'll start off by saying that I am in awe. You are so amazingly talented and gifted, it brings tears to my eyes. Your voice is gorgeous... I consider myself to be extremely fortunate to have stumbled upon your music. I am constantly searching for music that inspires me and at last I have found it. I think the song 'Roses' belongs on the radio! ...I am deeply moved by your music. I can't really explain why, there is just something about it that touches me. Thank you."" -Laura Moore"
5,John Barleycorn Must Die,The arrangement of John Barleycorn Must Die on this CD is fantastic! I highly recommend it.
2,Out of Stock and Please do not reorder,There are much better shaver's than this one. It was painful to use and does a poor job of shaving. One big benefit of an electric shaver is that it gives a fast shave. Not this one. It required going over the same locations several times and it really hurt because it tended to pull hair out rather than cut them. Charging is about 5 minutes. An OK shaver for your office if you are planning on meeting people after work.The Panasonic for a little more money is worlds apart in performance and comfort from this fellow.
3,"Good, but Red Flag if you have a beard","The razor charges quickly, is powerful, and shaves close - all good things it does well.The flaw is the pop-up trimmer that runs all the time, including in the down position where it's still exposed. If you have a beard, and the same is true for sideburns, and you want to shave close to it, you have to be very careful that the trimmer is on the away side or you'll do an unplanned cut on your beard/sideburns. That means you're constantly rolling the razor. It can be done, but first thing in the morning that's asking for a lot of thought for a task that shouldn't require any concentration.If you don't have a beard, or it and your sideburns are close cropped, this shouldn't be an issue and you'll probably be happy with the shaver."
1,no,this is the worst electric shaver i have ever used. the blade is just terrible and makes shaving a hassle. it is also very loud and vibrates hard.
4,My review,"This shaver shaves close and very quickly, probably about half the time that my previous Norelco took to shave. The cons are that it is loud, has noticeable vibration, and is harder to use around my neck area."
2,THIS IS NOT WHITE,"The hat fits nicely but I wanted white hats. These hats are NOT WHITE, they are off-white, almost beige. Not at all what I needed or wanted. I really need to send them back."
4,Works like expected,This clamp has been installed since this past summer and is still going strong. It was just what I needed to repair a sprinkler pipe with a hole in it the size of an eraser head. Cutting the pipe and repairing the traditional way was going to be a pain as the lines for all four zones run together in that area. I couldn't find this size clamp at any of the local home improvement stores so to Amazon I came. Delivered timely.
4,Valuable resource for family history search Czech ancestors,"I was contacted by the author around the time of publication. I purchased one copy for my family history research. This book contains information about some of my Czech ancestors and their descendents. The book was published privately, and had a limited number of copies printed. There are no new editions being printed of this book."
4,Thoughtful,"This is a thoughtful collection of stories of a progression through life from childhood, teenage, young adult and finally back from the terrifying empty spaces of old age, to extreme youth. Each story has a plot, a moral and interesting people but my favourite was ""Entities"" which gave me a few laughs to break up the seriousness of the whole book. This part in particular deals with the lives of novices to living in the country on a small holding, and dealing with animals for the first time and is full of good humour and all of the kinds of ridiculous situations which occur to people who find themselves being outsmarted by animals. It's a very ""different"" kind of book and was a change from the normal type of novel."
2,Not Atwood's Best Work,"""Moral Disorder"" was our book club selection, and I was happy to see the usually reliable Margaret Atwood as its author. As a short story fan, I was eagerly anticipating reading this book. Unfortunately, ""Moral Disorder"" seemed like a jumble of half-finished ideas for other books that never quite jelled. The characters are allowed to show random-seeming pieces of their lives, but little happens in terms of an actual plot to link these people into a cohesive, satisfying story. Overall, it was a disappointing read. Would strongly recommended ""The Robber Bride"" or ""A Handmaid's Tale"", which are much better examples of Atwood's abilities as a story teller."
4,Eras relived,"Ms. Atwood has a wonderful feel for writing about what it was like living in the 40's and 50's. She seems to have regarded that as, while perhaps not the happiest of her time, at least the most influential on the person she eventually becomes. How much of her own experience is revealed here is unclear, except that like CAT'S EYE, the reader can read between the lines and imagine revelations are being made."
3,"cute, fast and funny series romance...",this is a good book if you want to kill a few hours with a fun romance. I liked that the characters were all working class folks who actually had to work for a living and not the usual executive or millionaire in most series romances.The last 40 pages were a bit cheesy but the book has some actual laugh out loud moments as well.I'd recommend this book for anyone wanting a lighthearted romance.3 stars.
4,cat food,"the only food my cat will actually eat, he needs urinary tract all the time and refuses to eat the other precription brands"
2,Dawn Rochelle Series,"I loved the first 4 novels by LM in the Dawn Rochelle Series. I thought that they were original and awesome! But in the 5th DR series novel, ""To Live Again"" I was highly dissapointed. Since the DR series was at first just 4 books, and the 5th was written years later, you find yourself thinking ""This isn't the Dawn we know!!!"" Dawn seems to have a different attitude, like a different person, and a less likable one at that. The different obstacles Dawn go through are boring, and rather stupid. I found the book to put a damper on the whole series. In my opinion, if you read the DR series, just stop at the 4th one, and skip the 5th."
4,dawn thinks maybe the universe has given up tortuing her...,"this book is really good, exept you have to wonder, will dawn's life ever be normal? i mean, she gets lukemia, sandy dies, she gets a bone marrow transplant, marlee dies, she almost has a rejection to the bone marrow transplant, then, just when you think the universe has given dawn a break, she has a stroke. i know these books are about things that you can't change, but reading about dawns stroke was as bad as when mark died in 'till death do us part'. but, desptie dawns new unlucky change of events, she doesn't give up and the book gives a new meaning to the phrase 'how much can you handle?'. i look forward to future books."
4,To Live Again by Lurlene Mc Daniel,"This is a great fiction book that I just couldn't put down. I loved it and I hope you will to!To Live Again by Lurlene Mc Daniel is a very sad book. It is about a young girl around thirteen who is diagnosed with leukemia. Almost three years later, she is doing great. She is living a great life cancer free. But then she has stroke. It leaves her partly paralyzed. Her best friend Rhonda is filling her in on all that is happening at school, since she has been at the hospital. She has to go to therapy all of the time. But will she survive? This book is a great book for girls ages 8 and up."
3,"A look at ""Paradise for Sale""","This book wasn't too bad. It has a good point, but the author does a lot of extrapolating and does not give a really good solution to the problem of resource overuse. Also, the author insults much of modern industrial society, but when he descibes his trip to Nauru, he mentions that he wants ice cream at one point and describes the food served there (beef, chicken, jello, and more) as good. Notice that these good foods and the availability of them are products of Western industrial society. Perhaps he is just another professor type who thinks he is above the common man because of his Ph.D and that people will not see the hypocrisy in his ideas and actions."
2,Re-recordings,None of the songs on this album are the original hit versions. They are all re-recordings.
2,Covers,"The original Pat Boone material was OK but the covers (""Rip It Up"", ""Mr. Blue"", ""Ain't That A Shame"", and ""Tutti Frutti"") were totally lacking in soul and heart."
2,Boring!!!,Well i bought this DVD thinking my girls were going to like it because they loved seeing it on the tv. Well when i got and played it they got bored really fast and annoyed. would have returned it if my 3 year old didnt break the case. i wasted $10.
5,Great if you don't mind your kid picking up a funny accent,"This movie is obviously good because my kid won't put it down. He picked up on the series probably through PBS Kids (or maybe it was online, who knows?) and it became an obsession (he has autism, you just never know when something is going to ""click"" with him). Let's say he went ballistic when the DVD arrived."
3,Spanish not from Spain,"Bummer! We fell in love with Pocoyo in Spain, where my husband is from and where Pocoyo was created. My toddler son loves watching Pocoyo clips on Youtube and we wanted a full-length DVD for him to watch to reinforce his Spanish language. Really bummed to discover that this is dubbed for a Latin American audience, so both the voices and much of the vocabulary differ from what we are used to (e.g. the call the radio ""el radio,"" which is totally incorrect in Spain -- should be ""la radio."")Disappointed, since the main reason we bought the DVD was for my son to practice his language, accent, and listening skills in Spanish."
3,Adorable but boring for a kid,"I personally love Pocoyo, I think he and his friends are some of the cutest characters I have ever seen. This video is adorable and charming, and the images are age-appropriate for my almost-one-year-old. However, my baby was bored stiff by the videos. I'm hoping she gets into it as she gets older when she can understand the words, so for now it's going on the shelf. Sorry Pocoyo, see you later!"
2,Superficial Soap,"The characters make no sense, nor do their circumstances, nor do the way they resolve their dilemmas, and it takes much too long to cover any narrative territory. If the woman who had the abortion was so upset about having to take that decision, why did she do it, and what claim does she have on our sympathies given that she lies to her husband regularly? That bad a marriage is a problem rather than a drama, and given how awful the woman is, why doesn't her best friend run off with the husband? The idea that dividing a grammer school into competing groups as a way to improve education is laughable. These students are not interested in learning no matter how much they are begged to do so. Why bother? It might have played better as a farce about trying to improve schools rather than as a soap trying to come to grips with a social problem."
1,It Has Holes!!,"Bought this item for my trike to use on a trip this summer. I especially liked the fact that it came with a rain cover. HOWEVER, it also came with holes designed in the bottom for the bungees to pass through to hold it on. So what good is a rain cover if you put holes in the bottom to allow water to come in? I opened the package as I was packing, after the 30 day return limit so I had to pay return postage. Never expected the bag to have holes designed into it. Why not sew an additional piece on the outside bottom to secure the bag and bungees?"
5,Great product for a fair price.,Fits and looks good. A great way to add additional storage. Very durable and attaches easily. Would definitely buy this again.
4,convenient and quick,"The product arrived quickly and in pretty good shape. The boxes were just a little bit bent, no biggee. It wasn't any cheaper that at the store but I don't drive so it was more convenient."
3,Cheaper at Walmart,My mother's doctor prescribed this for her. I buy the 42 count at Walmart for $16.79. BJ's wholesale sells it for $19.47.
5,A Lifesaver!,"As my acid reflux worsened over the years, I made the usual progression from antacid tablets, to Pepcid AC, and eventually to prescription medications like Prevacid and Nexium. Prevacid works great but it still requires a prescription and Nexium caused side effects in me. Once Prilosec was offered over the counter I gave it a try and was very impressed. After a week or two of taking it every day, I was able to decrease the dosage to the point where I only take it as needed now. Once I feel heartburn starting, or I eat something guaranteed to give me heartburn, I just take one of these and its gone in about 30 minutes...and when I say gone I mean gone for 10-12 hours.I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers acid reflux or chronic heartburn."
5,Can't beat this Product,"if you have heart burn, this stuff really works. Pricing is good, product is good, that's about it. Buy again if needed."
4,packaging is a hassle,"Prylosec is a good product and does what it's supposed to do. But it doesn't come in large sizes. Most people who need this acid reducer need to take at least one a day, sometimes two. However, it only comes in boxes of 14 tablets. You cannot buy a large supply in a standard pill jar. If you purchase a 3 month supply, you get many boxes of 14 tablets. And it doesn't stop there. The tablets are encased in plastic and alminum so securely that you need to free them with a pair of scissors. It should not be so difficult."
5,Prilosec OTC,This product helps me with my heartburn and it works great! I would be in so much pain without it.
4,As good as Nexium?,"My husband was taken off Nexium from the insurance co(too expensive, nexium) and so he has been on this for five years and seems to work as well.We receive this automatically through 'subscription amazon savings'..Love this deal!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good product, but overpriced","This medication works fine, but it is outrageously overpriced. Omeprazole is off patent, the materials cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of the packaging, and it is produced by reputable makers of generic drugs overseas, like India and Israel. Their product is sold in the US at a multiple of the price you can get if you find a way to order directly from the maker, such as PurpleOutlet.Amazon used to sell omeprazole much cheaper, but no longer does. That product, in capsule form, was just as effective, but in much simpler packaging."
4,I wish I didn't need this stuff,"As an OTC, my pharmacist said this was the best ""acid reducer"" available. I am thrilled to find this product available online for a much more reasonable price than I can find even at Walmart! I highly recommend prilosec to anyone with GERD: taken regularly (I have to take two tablets each day when I am treating my arthritis), I am symtom free. Outstanding! I would give this product five stars if the manufacturer would stop wasting so many resources packaging it!"
5,Alternate Prilosec and Prevacid to ameliorate your GERD,I have GERD and take an acid reducer daily. I alternate bi-weekly between Prilosec and Prevacid to avoid developing a resistance to one or the other of the two medicine and to minimize each of the medicine's negative effects (such as interference with vitamin absorption). These medicines have been a life saver for me.
5,yes,I'm on my second one and feel great and I've been suffering from heart burn and chest pain for about 2 months and its no great feeling
3,Other options are available for less money,Prilosec OTC works fine but is still pricey. There are other generic products available that do the same thing for a lot less money. I not longer use this product. Do your research. Check your local Sams Club or Costco for products that do the same thing for much less money.
1,Omeprzole not for me,"This product contains Omeprazole and the side effects were awful. I had terrible stomach pain, headaches and abdominal pain. After stopping this product all those symptoms went away."
1,I found it difficult to find simple definitions.,I found it difficult to find simple definitions.I found it difficult to find simple definitions.I found it difficult to find simple definitions.
1,no bargain,how do you people feel this is a bargain? its the same price in walmart. the generic is a much better buy and its exactly the same thing..don't waste your money.
3,"Heatburn Relief GREAT, Acid Reflux so-so!","This product works most of the time, however if you have acid reflux be careful as I have been taking this product and still have had some minor reflux issues...if you are lucky enough to have prescription coverage, I would get that, if not, get this."
5,Prilosec,The Prilosec is very effective in controling heart burn.You cannot beat the price even with the coupons that you would usein the store. I use this product on a daily basis and it is veryeffective.
5,Using Prilosce since 1997 (14 yrs) .,"As the title says, I have been using the prilosec for 14 years now. And I haven't had any issues or side effects in all these years. This is really the only antacid that helps my heartburn. Dr put me on it in 1997 and I have been taking 1 pill a day since."
1,Not what is advertised.,"I would not recommend ordering this product from Choice One. I ordered this and did not receive the box with 42 Tablets as advertised. Nor was it the New Easier to Open. It was one box with 2 - 14 count panels and a separate box with 1 - 14 count panel. This did total 42 Tablets but not as described or pictured. One of the panels expires in one year. Why order this product from Choice One when you can go to Wal-Mart and get them with a coupon for the same money? Also, the last I bought from Wal-Mart had 3 years before they expired. This is the first time I've ordered from Amazon online and was not totally satisfied with my order. Very very disappointed."
5,Great price,I love this product. I suffer from GERD. I do the treatment every 4 -5 months. during those 14 days i don't experience any heartburn. Use according to what your Dr. tells you.GREAT GREAT PRODUCT
5,Acid reducer,"This is a quite good acid reducer, most of the time, however, I have to take it twice a day as opposed to once a day that is recommended and I have been taking it every day for several years now and must but on the package it says to take it for only a certain length of time. That just doesn't work for me."
4,It does the job,"Prilosec OTC reduces my acid reflux to almost zero. I occasionally have some discomfort late at night if I eat too much of the wrong food. I do experience an unwanted side effect, but I will continue to use Prilosec OTC until I find something that controls my acid reflux as well as it does without the side effects. Prevacid is not the answer."
1,Works great but found something better,"Pepcid Complete Acid Reducer + Antacid with Dual Action, Cool Mint, Chewable Tablets , 50 chewable tabletsI started using Prilosec because nothing else would work, but had to take it all the time against the recommended dosage. Without Prilosec, I could not have functioned without always being in pain, but I needed to take it 365 days a year. By experimenting with other anti-acids, I found that I could substitute Pepcid Complete, one tablet a day, and never went back to Prilosec. Tons less expensive, and safer to use all the time."
1,Side Effects,"I took this for three days, but had to stop due to the extreme stomach cramping, gas, bloating, and diarrhea. I think anyone with a sensitive digestive system will have difficulty with Prilosec. Here is what happened to me:Day 1 - no problemsDay 2 - woke up to bloating and extreme urge to move bowels. Later in the day moved bowels more often.Day 3 - diarrhea throughout the day with bloating and crampsDay 4 - did not take medicine, diarrhea during the dayDay 5 - did not take medicine, loose stools throughout the day, bloating, crampsDay 6 - returning to more normal functions, but still some discomfort"
5,Does the job,I had been facing heartburn and heavy duty belching for some weeks when I ordered this after my doctor recommended it. It works!
5,Great product / price / service,Found the best price and service here at Amazon. Arrived within a few days of ordering and with the automatic shipment program got an extra discount and never have to worry about running out again. Great deal!
2,Prilosec OTC packaged 42,The package arrived very heavily damaged. All the pills appeared to be there but some were chipped.
1,WORST STORE EVER!!!!!,"I ordered this months ago. First they said that 7 were available, then when I went to purchase them they said that there are only 2 left. I ordered them anyway. (BIG mistake) No shipment ... first letter; no shipment ... second letter; no shipment ... third letter; no shipment ... final letter ... COMPANY HAS NOT REPLIED IN ANY WAY TO ANY OF THE LETTERS!!!!!"
1,Pricey,Prlosec is a great product and I use it every day. However watch what you pay. Even before shipping costs you can find the 42-tablet package for under $25 -- at Target for instance.
5,Good stuff,"After losing my prescription benefits when I changed jobs due to pre-existing condition rules, I could not afford to purchase Protonix, a very effective acid reflux reducer. Not being able to imagine more days of painful regurgitation, I ran to the store to see what they had to offer. I tried a few over the counters, had a few bad acid days and finally tried Prilosec OTC. It relieved my symptoms as well as Protonix.The only bummer is that I have to take it every day - not just for 14 days at a time. My doctor tells me this is alright and will have no long term ill effects."
4,Works for me!,"This medication works well for my type acid reflux. Different medications are offered over the counter and as a prescription. I have been taking this for at least three years now. It practically eliminates my condition which is a blessing. If I don't take it, I suffer. I am on automatic delivery with Amazon at a reasonable price lower than retail stores with free shipping."
4,It works but,"while this is significantly less cost than pharmacy or any other market, it still does the same thing as its generic--and the generic is cheaper. I buy it simply because my wife will use it--no doubt for the box and never tried the generic that I take."
4,saves a doctor visit,For a lot of people with heartburn due to perscription medications or over the counter pain relievers this product might help avoid a visit to the doctor.I frequently take Advil for pain relief.Prilosec takes care of my stomach problems.
5,A profound and recommended addition to Buddhist studies,"Compiled and edited by Jeremy D. Safran, Psychoanalysis And Buddhism: An Unfolding Dialogue brings together dialogues from a group of nineteen talented writers who focus on concerns respecting the intersection of Buddhism and the science of psychoanalysis. Contemplating the complexities of the human mind, will, and spirit, these informed and informative writings meditate upon the depths of transformation possible in the individual. A profound and recommended addition to Buddhist studies shelves, Psychoanalysis And Buddhism will prove of immense interest and value to students of Eastern Philosophy and Western Psychology."
1,Dissapointed Mom,"I was so excited purchasing Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends ""Figure 8 Set Expansion Pack"" for my three year old son, but upon receiving it in the mail I was dissapointed.Many you all know how expensive these toys are and I thought I was getting a good deal on what the picture showed, but all I got was the ""Expansion Tracks"". All the accessories shown in the illustration, that look to be included with the set are shown on back of the box as additional pieces to purchase."
3,Another one fooled!,Add me to the list of people who thought they were purchasing a full train set. I sent the toy to my nephew. When it was opened no one knew what to do with a bunch of train tracks pieces. My brother called me to ask why I had sent such a gift! He had to go purchase the figure 8 set so they had something to work with. I am really steamed!
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"The same thing happened to me. When I placed my order in the beginning of November, this set was NOT suppose to be the expansion set. It was the starter set. Then there were problems with the manufacturer. I received it a short time ago and just now realized I received the expansion set. This is a big disappointment and a HUGE mistake."
1,WARNING-MISLEADING!,"This set contains ONLY: 16 pieces of track. It has no bridge, building, trees, Sir Topham Hatt, Thomas The Tank Engine or cars."
1,Beware!,"Better beware - you don't get what is illustrated on the screen (i.e. a full set) - the name is the giveaway - it is an expansion pack and you need to buy the ""figure of 8 set"" first (dollar amount) before you get what you see on screen - a swiz, no? - by the way, that is why I give 1 star -otherwise 5 stars if you pay for the extras ..."
4,Terrific Thomas and Friends!,"These trains, and movies are our kids favorites. They have played with them for the past 3 years, and still play with them every day. They have learned numbers and colors from the various engines in the Thomas family.The durability is unmatched, and we envision them giving the trains to their children some day."
4,Interesting revelations,This very interesting book exists thanks to inadequate means of communication and also to Molotov himself.He gave the original letters to the authorities long after Stalin's death.The letters are of great importance as they go beyond the formal language used in correspondences.The problems facing the new Soviet republic are mentioned in letters in everyday language.The book has to be read with other books related with the period as there are several broken links between letters.Could be read as a preliminary for studying the Soviet Union in 1930s.
5,An excellent read,"I really enjoyed this book. It highlighted many of the concerns and feelings I've had for quite some time. This book is an honest, reflective look at the problems in America's Muslim community. What I like most is while he offers a critique of our community's problems he also offers solutions."
5,Quite a thrill ride!,"This was the first of the Carrier series books that I read, and I have read two since and spoken with the author. I must say that Nuke Zone was perhaps the best in the series. It starts off excitingly, and continue's that way throughout its entirety. There is more than just air-to-air combat going on as one might expect. There is even a hired assassin that sneaks aboard the carrier USS Jefferson and plants a bomb to take out one of the catapults, which is a slight twist to what would seem normal for a book like this. The aerial battles are quite intense, and it is impossible to stop reading until the battle is over. The characters are pretty realistic, but it helps to read more than one book in the series to get a feel for them. I strongly suggest that anyone that likes severe action read this."
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book. The author appears to make quite a few errors, both in the definitions and in the examples, enough so that I could not be sure what was intended. I cannot recommend this as a tutorial in abstract algebra. However, the confusion did force me to think about the subject."
1,Not much help,This book did not help me with my Abstract Algebra class. The chapters in Schaum's did not align with the chapters in my assigned textbook.
1,not helpful,"This book did not help me at all. It covers a tremendous amount of material. So the outlines are very thin. One has to know the material very well to read this book.I would have liked to see a lot more detail for Groups, Rings, Fields and Modules, with a lot of worked out problems. And none of the Vector space, Lin Algebra, Matrix and Boolean Algebra stuff. In that way it would help undergrad abstract algebra students. The way this book is written, I can't see who the target audience is right now."
2,Full of errors,"~I usually gave books I bought not bad reviews. But this one, I hate to put it in this way, is full of wrong concept, unclear definition, misleading explanation, incomplete proof, ... A mathmactics book like this is a real shame!The reason I did not give it one star was I like Schaum book's style: definition, then example, then exercise, then answer at the end (this one doesn't have).In sum, you can't use this book for any purpose, except as one reviewer pointed out, the errors really~~ make you think about the concept. But before you can do that, you should already know some basic abstract algebra and have a logic mind.~"
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is full of wrong concepts, wrong definitions, misleading explanation, wrong proofs, ... A math book like this is a real shame! I have thrown this book to the garbage!As it is possible that nobody has corrected this book before putting it in the sale?"
2,The boy next door,"When good-looking Scott moves in next to Crystal, she desperately wants to get his attention. And she gets it.This one really disappointed me.It was so obvious what happened (I won't give anything away here, though) all through the book, leaving no surprises at all. Very unlike Stine."
3,"This book was...pretty good,but not like some of the others!","I think this book was good,but compared to the other Fear Street books he has written,this one stunk! The deaths were hardly exiting,at least I thought so.I mean,smothering a person,fine,but not as exiting as bathing washclothes in gasoline and locking the doors and setting the place on fire! (Halloween Party) I still think it was..pretty good."
5,I THINK IT'S GREAT!!!,"WHEN I FIRSTBOUGHT THIS BOOK,(BY THE WAY THIS IS MY FIRST BOOK BUT KNOW I HAVE LOTS OF THEM),I THOUGHT THIS WAS BORING BUT WHEN I FINISH READING IT I WAS WRONG.IT WAS AWESOME ESPECIALLY WHEN SCOTT WANTS TO KILL CRYSTAL BUT MELINDA HELPED HER.I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.!!!!!"
2,It wasnt that great,This book had a really stupid plot. Nothing about it waz realistic. The dog part was Horrible. I didnt like it at all.
4,kiss of death,"This book is brilliant in the sense that it has you completely hooked, and you can read it more than once comfortably, though that applies to many of R.L. Stine's books. From the first chapter you know who the bad guy is, though the insight to his POV is pretty cool. Once you you really get into the story, you don't expect the ending entirely. A nicely written book and all around good read."
2,"Poor production quality, hard to watch","My son wants nothing more than to watch trucks and tractors in action. I was so excited to see this video at the toy store -- but was soooooo disappointed when I viewed it. As another reviewer suggested, the production quality makes this video almost impossible to watch. It also seems the producers tried to intersperse the video images with goofy, ""stimulating"" or ""educational"" content -- very lame. Leave that to Baby Einstein. All my kid wants is to see the trucks at work -- with maybe a little background music. Keep it simple, please."
1,Love the big machines - hate the video,"I was talking with another father recently and he suggested I look into a video for my son that features large construction machines. A quick trip to Toys-R-Us had me purchasing ""I Love Big Machines - Vol. 1"" on VHS. My son wasn't as interested as I would have hoped, but I can attribute it to him being 15 months old and perhaps too young for it. However, as a video professional, I can tell you that the production level of this video is poor. There is a kid on the video that has no business narrating anything beyond a school project. The microphone used couldn't have been anything better than something found on the discount rack at Radio Shack. And the editing was similar to what you might find on your local cable public access station. It may be cute to use your son on your video projects (I have to think it was the producer's son used as a narrator), but not for a professionally marketed tape. For the price paid ..., I expected much more."
2,"Uh, what is this we've bought?","Includes some items that are not big machies (a wind-up duck toy, bridges, hot air balloons), annoying diversions from the theme, and an adbsurdly sexist comment. A lot of the footage is repeated, some of it a few times. Overall the production is amateurish, bad sound quality, creepy music, and the narration by a pre-teen is sometimmes unclear. Not recommended."
3,Good but not enough.,Good guide to buying foreclosed properties but to much generalities. No one seems to share the real secrets in buying foreclosed properties. Need a good book on researching liens.
1,Too General to be of much use,"I read the book and it was very general. If you knew a lot already you might pick up a few tips, but the book does not have the content needed to teach you how to do this business. Skip this one."
1,empty vhs,"Unfortunately I brought this product last year, took it as a present to my father and found out it was empty. It was imposible to return it. How can I make sure it doesn't happen again"
1,poor mounting hardware,"I bought two blades for my car. The adapter for one blade would not fit, the adapter for the other was missing from the package. In my almost 50 years of driving, during which I've always replaced my wiper blades myself, I have never seen such poor hardware. However the blades themselves seem adequate--if you can get them on. I had to reuse the adapters from my old Bosch blades, which with a very slight alteration fit fine."
3,Regular,"Novela es interesante , una copia de la novela Tu o nadie con Lucia mendez ,, La actuacion de LA Monterola es regular , la novela es un poco irreal algunas partes ,como donde esta embarazada pero nunca se le ve la barriga del embarazo, o cuando la chica es atacada pero nunca se despeina y se le bien vestida y cuidada despues de una escena de violencia .Uhmm es una novela regular ,, entretenida"
3,Hef's little black book gives short and sassy glimpse of Hef.,"You have to hand it to Hef. Well into his twilight years he manages to surround himself with beautiful, nubile young women who cater to his every whim.In ""Hef's Little Black Book"" little glimpses of Hef's life are shared. We learn that Millie (his first wife) cheated on him, thus opening the door for his dalliances. We discover that the gorgeous Barbie Benton broke up with him when she discovered he was double dipping with another. That movie night is a big time in Hef's life. That black silk pj's make for good outerwear etc.If you are a diehard Hef fan you may enjoy this book. On the other hand if you want to learn more about the playmates with shocking insights into Hef such as the awful reality that he does NOT use protection read Jill Ann Spaulding's book, ""Upstairs"".Overall ""Hef's Little Black Book"" is indeed all about Hef, and only for those who want nitty gritty details shared by Mr. Hefner about himself."
2,Disappointing,"This little black book is quite disappointing, it was not written very well, was jumpy, erratic and difficult to follow at times. Hefner has an amazing life (as evidenced by his very words in this book) and his ""co-writer"" Zehme could have expressed it in a much more eloquent way that would have honored his life, rather than the slipshod smattering of quotes presented in this book."
5,A Treasure Book for Large Living!,"This is a happy surprise of a book--a sensual feast full of great crisp bio writing, smart life advice, and tons of fun, cool retro pix of the Hefworld all us grown boys have always wanted to get inside of! I felt like I was spending one long jazzy night at the Playboy Mansion when I read it! Plus I never expected such well thought-out wisdom from good ol' Hef--everything on how to win over a woman's heart to how to win over her body. And his business acumen is spelled out in a way to inspire the big dreams inside all guys--and women too. (My girlfriend digs it almost as much as I do.) I'm giving it to my dad for Father's Day, and nephew for graduation... Anytime's a good time to share the gift of Hef!!! Long may he swing!"
1,Hefs Little Black Book,Well I so wish I could share my opinion on this book. But I ordered it last January 2008 and have yet to receive it. They keep telling me its out of stock. For almost a year !!!! This is the only book I really really wanted for my collection and can not seem to get it. I want to have Hef sign it as he will always be one of the Greatest Men I have ever met in my life. When you talk about Gentlemen he is at the top of the list. So what ever negative things people write about him its because they don't know him and never met him. I was very very lucky and blessed to have met him years ago and have never been treated so kindly. I wish I could go back in time and be ONE OF THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR. I hope Holly Madison keeps Hef happy always. Please send me this book. Then you will get the best reviews I have to offer.
2,A Kingsley Amis pastiche,"I ordered this book from the library, after it was briefly referred to as ""hilarious"" in a recent review of ""Talk to the Hand: The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the World Today, or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door"". Sadly, I found that it didn't live up to its billing.It's not a dreadful book, and certainly it is better than any first novel that I am likely to write. But neither its characters nor its storyline are very interesting, and I can certainly see why it faded into obscurity when it was originally published."
5,A must have For Big and Small Businesses,"Checkpoint's Firewall provides the best security protection against intrusion from the internet. With low price compare to other inefficient, yet high price product from other companies, this firewall is the solution for big and small businesses. Checkpoint firewall is the best protection available on the market."
2,Easy to break,Do not purchase. Very fragile product. The material used is clearly cheap it's not heavy glass. I was really disappointed.
1,Like drinking from a Ball jar,Very uncomfortable for drinking. The ridges for the screw cap are right where you put your lips. It makes it uncomfortable and sloppy as it is prone to dripping. One of the ridges even has a slight chip making it even more unpleasant. I have a similar product from Tazo and cannot find another anywhere. It has a flat surface above the screw ridges - wish I could find another like it...
3,Beware: This CD is not mixed,"Just got the CD and was surprised to find that it's not evenmixed. I assumed it was a mixed compilation because of the accoladefrom Muzik magazine and the title ""Incredible Sound of..."" It should be titled ""The Incredible Songs that Trevor Nelson likes."" Shame on him for not having the talent to make a mix CD. Now I'm stuck with a [CD] full of single tracks and I'm not going to bust that out at a party."
2,The Motorola V180,"I recently purchased this phone and after only three weeks the LCD screen started acting up, coming on scrambled and at times I would flip the phone open and it would display just a black screen. I figured maybe it was just a bad phone so I exchanged it for another V180. I have this new phone for about a week and a half, and I am seeing similar signs which led to the problems that I had with the first phone. This phone is aesthetically nice looking and has some nice features, but until they work out the bugs its not worth it, I would pass on this one."
1,Is there a way to put a MINUS-SUPER NEGATIVE star?,"I had the same problem other people had with LCD screen. The phone company (T-Mobile, also super negative service) wants to charge me for replacing the phone claiming abuse. I used the phone only for 3 days and it went bad.Get another phone and brand."
1,Don't waste your money,This is easily the worst cell phone I have ever owned. The quality is very poor(cheap plastic...the phone actually creaks when you flip it open). The screen in too small and dark even w/the brightest setting. The menu is non-intuitive and the simple task of using the phone book is a hassle. My 3 year old Samsung was of much higher quality and better in every aspect. With all the choices on the market don't waste your money - Fred B.
2,My tracfone is better!,"I had this phone. I malfunctioned occasionally. I really wasn't impressed with tmobile coverage area:(. I got a tracfone(v60i motorola) And it has worked out much better. Tracfones promos like the referral- authorized person sends you a referral before you activate a new tracfone and you get 100 minutes at no charge! it rocks. I have way better coverage with my tracfone. I am now authorized to give referrals so if you need one, just send a request to sunnyryanj@yahoo, the v60i is cdma and if you like GSM phones tracfone also has those and they work on both cingular/att and tmobile so you get the best gsm coverage there is! and theres free roaming! Tracfone is better. mmhm..."
5,Great phone !!!!,"This phone is very nice. I am not surethis receives bad reviews. Works great for me !I guess, you have be careful when handling nicephones like this !Treat the phone with some respect. You bang it up youget a banged up looking phone. Hence, damage to screen ?!"
1,"Poor reception, a stir of echos","I've had this phone for a year and I'm just about to get rid of it - can't wait. I don't know if it's this particular phone or the model, but reception is poor and I frequently hear my own voice echoed back at me while I'm talking. The other party doesn't hear it so it's not a complete disaster, but it's tough training yourself to ignore that. I do know one other person with the same phone who's had similar problems."
5,I love this Phone,"I have had my phone for a week, it took a little time for me to get used to the features, being a Nokia user but once I got the hang of it, I fell in love. This is a great phone for a reasonable price and I like that i wasn't forced to get a camera, just because I wanted a flip style phone. The design is sleek and very attractive. Its very user friendly and anyone interested in a good economical, but stylish phone will enjoy this one. I do agree that a belt clip would have been nice, but they aren't expensive to buy."
3,Pretty decent phone,"I have had this phone for about six months now and have had no problems. It's small and has pretty decent features like an alarm clock which I constantly use. My reception is pretty great, and I have even used this phone in the elevator where I work with no problems. I like use my t-zones to check out stuff on yahoo like movies and news.My only problems are, I am not able to download games which is a bummer,(i can play online games though through t-mobile), and once in a great while while i am text messaging, the phone screen has gone black. It recovers, but I hope that isn't going to be some big issue."
1,terrible reception,"Horrible phone, every few days you need to shut it off and turn back on to get decent reception, calls dropped all the time. Stay away!"
4,Thorough knowledge for Interior construction and details,"This book should be on the shelves of every interior designer- it's so thorough that it's a little cumbersome at first. It should be used as a reference book, it gives chapter-by-chapter explanations on the specifics for the construction and application of windows, casegoods, partitions, etc. If there is ever any doubt in a designers mind as to how exactly something is constructed or works when it comes to the specifics of interior design, this book's for you."
3,Good reference book but boring,"Has lots of tables and charts, and is adequately explained. The author also writes study guides for standardized architecture tests, and that pretty much sums up the style: no opinions, just facts. Very thorough though. Personally I don't need a whole chapter on locks, but I suppose there are those who do. Presentation and graphics are a bit low-rent for an architecture book."
1,Know the man,"I know Paul Hawker personally. He is a hypocrite, a liar and a cheat. If these are the type of qualities in a person that you are trusting to tell you how to discern Gods voice then this is the book for you."
4,In glossy color too!,"Expected just another erotic manga. The chapters build into one wild story after another. The stories are seperate, but still loosely tied together. A very hard comic to find, and when you do find it, it's sold out! That should tell you that this one erotic manga that you should not pass up!"
4,They worked,"I used these patches when I went on a family vacation with a bunch of non-smokers. I was very surprised at how effective they were in taking away cravings and relieving stress, better than nicotine patches that I have also tried. I stopped without agony for ten days. I started smoking again after returning to the real world - not committed yet. I am ready to stop again, and am ordering these patches for support. If you are quitting, you may find these patches very helpful for a relatively low cost."
1,these suck.,"I feel like these are just skin colored stickers. they did absolutely nothing, even though i really wanted to stop smoking. and if it isnt bad enough that it does nothing, it leaves a sticky mess after you pull it off. dont waste your money."
1,dermmathol patch,"I am thoroughly disappointed with the patch. I do realize that you have to be commited to stop smoing as well, which I was geared up to do, but the patch in no way has helped me to take the edge off. Thumbs down!"
1,don't buy,I've sampled several different quit smoking products all of which I've had at least some success on cutting back or stopping smoking for a period of time...until this product. I currently have 4patches on and don't feel it helping at all. This is the only product that has not helped me at all. Its worthless.
5,An anthology of free- verse poetry dwelling upon reflective human insights and the workings of the mind,"Now in a revised and expanded edition featuring contemporary woman poet Pattiann Rogers' own selection from her work, including poems from her five published books since the first edition of ""Firekeeper"" was released in 1994, Firekeeper: Selected Poems is an anthology of free- verse poetry dwelling upon reflective human insights and the workings of the mind while observing day to day life in both civilization and the wild. The poems are brief yet paint a rich and contemplative canvas awash with imagery of the natural world. Second Witness: The only function of the red-cupped fruit / Hanging from the red stem of the sassafras / Is to reveal the same shiny blue orb of berry / Existing in me. // The only purpose of the row of hemlocks blowing / On the rocky ridge is to give form to the crossed lines / and clicking twigs, the needle- leaf matrix / Of evergreen motion I have always possessed...."
3,fair not great,"This is a two piece protector so it does not give a lot of added strenth that I was looking for. Also, the stainless rust everywhere it gets a scratch."
4,"Well done, Sneaky Pie!!","This ""Mrs. Murphy"" mystery is so well done. It was a page turner to the max! Most of the time I can figure out ""who done it"" before Ms. Brown & Sneaky Pie let the cat out of the bag (no pun intended) but this one had me puzzled right to the end - and what an ending!"
4,These books are a lot of fun!,"This latest in the Mrs. Murphy series is one of the best for awhile. In it we see Harry and her friends planning for a 20th School Reunion. Someone else is planning to make a splash at this reunion. This person hopes to leave a mark by killing off the Class of 1980 one by one. Does this person have a motive for killing certain people, or is it just random acts of violence? There are a large number of deaths in this book, but that adds to the excitement, but if people in Crozet keep getting murdered, there soon won't be anyone left. I love the characters, both animal and human, in this series, and am happy that I still have a few more Mrs.Murphy adventures to read. Murphy, Pewter and Tucker are wonderful (and they're pretty good sleuths too)."
4,Leaves one wanting more...,"I have read all of Rita Mae Brown's fictional works, and I love the way she uses the language. As a cat lover, I couldn't resist the books co-authored by Sneaky Pie. Reading has always been a way to go to other places, and the pictures that RM Brown creates take one there precisely. The animal characters are believable, lovable, wise and sassy. I do think that Harry's ""outsider"" stance in the community where she has lived her whole life is getting tiresome. She is so very much involved with everyone--as the Post Mistress she is at the very center of the action in the town--she should get over the past and move on. The only negative about the book is the illustrations. I much prefer the characterizations of the animals in the illustrations in the first five Mrs. Murphy books."
2,Too bad... it could have been much better,"Against all odds, Legally Blonde made its way to a sequel, which was good enough and didn't let us down. Now the first soundtrack was suprisingly good, I liked almost every track of it. I couldn't wait to have the second soundtrack, and ohh big disappointment. I liked 2 tracks of it. My advice, don't get it. Leann Rimes' ""We Can"" is a very uplifting song and Hope 7's ""Breakthrough"" is rellly nice too... but the soundtrack ends there. Unfortunately the whole CD is just not worth it just for those 2 songs that are great."
4,"This Cd wasn't as good as the movie, but good competition","This cd was really good. I especially enjoyed superchik's song. If you enjoyed the movie then this cd is a good bet. P.S. Whats up with associating Howard Dean with Leann Rimes' song ""WE Can""?"
3,Served only one purpose,"Depending on your taste of music, ""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde"" OST can be either your greatest friend or your worst enemy. In the case of me, while many of these songs weren't exactly my ""cup of tea,"" some were fairly enjoyable but to be frank the only reason I bought this OST was to practice a cheerleading routine with the song ""More Bounce (in California)"". Like I said before, Legally Blonde OST isn't necessarily for everybody...it just depends on your taste. And if you should happen to like every song on here, that's special. And if you don't, that's special too."
4,This cd is cool,"The song ""we can"" by Leann Rimes just tops this cd off. That song is open and free and fun. It makes this cd worth purchasing because it is so light and refreshing. She did a bang up, awesome job on it. The music is the icing on the cake for the movie."
3,"It a good soundtrack, but","It's missing songs. Especially Avril Lavigne's ""Nobody's Fool"" which is played when Elle first walkes into the White House. I think there's more songs missing, but it's still a good soundtrack filled with pretty pink songs."
2,Dry and uninspiring,"I understand that this is supposed to be research and not a RPG fan's writing. To my mind, it fails on both accounts. It is very factual and has limited analytical insights as real research is meant to be. It is also uninspiring for RPG fans or wannabees as it fails to explore what brings and most importantly keeps players around the table. Overall disappointing."
4,Great Workout ...but you need more time,"I bought this book because I have the 12-minute Total Body Workout by Vedral and I wanted to see if she had updated her excercises. I was very pleased with this book, the exercises are easy to learn and they work! However, there is no way you can do it in 8 minutes a day without sacrificing proper movement and form. Plan on spending between 15 and 20 minutes per day for four days, 30-40 minutes per day for two days, or about 1 1/2 hours for one day. In the 12-Minute book, you did 2 body parts, 2 exercises each, for 3 reps. In this book, it's 3 body parts, at least 3 exercises each, 3 reps each plus stretching. How on earth did she think you could do it in 8 minutes?"
5,I really like this book,"I have tried many many books, but this one is the best yet. It is easily started so you can work up to the heavier exercises."
3,Bone Building Body Shaping Workout,"I found this to be a great all-over workout that helped increase strength and was not hard to do. I am, however, disappointed that my Dexa Scans did not improve while doing this plan over a three year period. I went from Osteopenia to Osteoporosis in that three year time frame. I am currently trying interval training along with weight bearing exercising with a Certified Trainer and am looking forward to improvements by my next Dexa Scan."
4,Machine Pistols and Submachine Guns Volume II 1964-1980,"Excellent resource. I did not know about this book until recently.A very good companion to ""the Worlds Submachine Guns Vol I.Information about machine pistols is hard to come by.Also, much information about submachine guns, machine pistols, and cross over projects that never made it into production but are very interesting."
5,Very good book for the enthusiast or collector!,This book is very comprehensive; it has lots of information not found in many other books. This book is a must for any collector of this type of firearms.
2,"Instructions not so ""easy"" to follow","I have a 1999 VW Passat, and I haven't changed my wiper blades myself all that often -- generally the auto parts store employees come out and do it for me (good and bad for obvious reasons). It took me FOREVER to figure out that I didn't need to use the adapter included in their package -- the adapter was needed to install my previous blades, and they fit on the end of the hooks just perfectly, so it was mind-boggling to me that the wiper wouldn't install. Omitting that made wiper installation a ""breeze."" I am STILL steaming. I would have appreciated one tiny statement on the instructions saying that the adapter might not be necessary."
3,Didn't see the movie,"But I could picture it in black and white. Fast, fun read. Has a military depth to the main character that was unexpected. I thought the book was going to be focused on keeping up with the joneses and 50's affluency and materialism but that ended up being a smaller part of the book than I expected. I don't read much fiction but I liked this book as an break from deeper reading."
2,Not worth it.,"I'm sorry. I have tried to read M.C. Beaton's Agatha series, but after three attempts I can honestly say I do not like them. The Potted Gardener I read because of the 5 Star rating but really found it about a 2 if that. Her best series is her Hamish MacBeth books. I have read every single one and have loved them. The Agatha series does not have any of the wonderfully real characters that you find yourself liking and looking forward to visiting again. Agatha's relationship with James is very irritating. Where Hamish and his love for Priscilla just keeps you hoping they will find their way back to each other. The three Agatha books that I have read were flat/boring and I found myself flipping through just to get to the end. For a Hamish Macbeth book I would definitely buy it in hardback. Agatha Raisin - I don't even think I would pick it up at the used bookstore... I'm sorry, Ms. Beaton."
5,Great book with very useful CD,Quite simple and good presentation of all major project management concepts. CD contains set of templates covering most of the aspects of project methodology. Strongly recommended for novices to PM.
4,"""Short"" long on interest.","Matthew's memoir of his Viet Nam Special Forces service is a refreshing variation from the more typical, ""blood/gore/war sucks"" offerings . His insights, especially those related to practical coexistence among the area's numerous indigenous groups shed a fresh and often humorous light on an otherwise dark chapter of national angst.It's a pleasing and informative read."
5,Girls Chasing Cars,Hey - the war sucked and was a farce: a terrible waste of lives. We all know that. But Matthews puts a twist on his experiences that would make anyone smile - from a grizzled combat veteran to a hardcore protester. Forget every other funny book you have read about wars - you will not be able to put this one down. I would love to spend a night throwing a few back with the author and hearing the stories that were left on the cutting room floor! A great find.
2,"Wonderful stories, not much else","This book tells you short and sometimes sentimental stories about amazing people doing the most amazing things. It makes it clear that there really are people out there doing great things, and it also gives you the feeling that you too can and ought to do it.This is of course not bad of a book, but it might not be all that you want. If you are interested in understanding why these people do what they do or why you do what you do (whatever that is), you are not likely to find much help here. What this book gives you is the stories, not the explanations or the understanding. (If you want the latter you are better off reading, e.g., ""The Altruistic Personality"" by Samuel P. Oliner and Pearl M. Oliner.)It should also be mentioned that the book is sprinkled with quotations from thinkers from different times and different parts of the world. Some might find these quotations profound, whereas others might find them stupid and annoying."
2,Not so good for Palmer,"As an avid Diana Palmer fan, I rushed to get this book, and sat down with it as soon as it arrived, only to be a bit disappointed. This is not the easy read as her other titles are. The story seems to drag, and the characters Marc and Josette have so much potential in the beginning, only to fade by the middle of the book. This just didn't capture my attention, and can I please ask Palmer to stop the virgin, who can't physically have sex without an operation, theme because it is getting a little redundant."
2,The Texas Ranger,"I've read most of Diana Palmer's books. I must admit I liked her earlier books better, although Lord Of The Desert was pretty entertaining. But The Texas Rangers isn't worth reading. The book starts slow and gets slower. By the time the heroine and hero meet, the author had lost me. She went into too much explanation at the beginning and then kept repeating herself, turning a book that held promise into something that was slow repetitive and boring."
3,Not The Best,"I love Diana Palmer's books so when I read this book I thought that I would be in for a easy reading book with great character compatibility, but this book fell slightly short. I felt that the heroine in this story was a little too unbelieveable. Especially with the way that Ms. Palmer required her to have surgery before she could be intimate. I thought that it was a little drastic way to keep her from being intimate. I just found some of the situations being unbelievable. If you are looking for a great easy read this is not the book you want as your first choice."
2,Not the best from Diana Palmer,The basic plot of the book surrounds a pseudo murder mystery and the events leading to the capture of the cliche mobster. The romance story between Josette and Marc is NOT endearing. He treats her terribly and if Josette had the sense God gave her she would have left him in the past. He treats her with indifference and cruelty throughout the book up unitl the last chapter. I expected more from the Texas Ranger and will hope that her next book will be better
1,boring and a waste of money,"i am a major diana palmer fan but i am beginning to wonder if someone else is writing under her name. this book and the one previous were both boring, predictable and a waste of money.maybe she has become so popular she doesn't care what she writes about as long as she gets paid. also who is editing these books?? the error ratio is horrendeous. i feel like blue penciling the book myself and mailing it back to publisher!!"
1,Avid Palmer fans beware....this book is a disapointment!,"I am one of many avid Diana Palmer fans. I have all of her books, and do not even read the back of her books when a new one comes out...I just grab!! However, this book was a huge letdown!! I will not give a complete review, because I was unable to finish the book. After several chapters, I just skipped through pages throughout the book and saw more of the same. As a fan, I usually do not mind that many of her books are similar, as she seems to find a way to make each book a keeper. Not this one. Hopefully, her upcoming Silhouette release will be back up to her standards."
3,Same Old Same Old !!!,"Please Please , Please Dianna Palmer , give your fans something new!!!. I am a huge fan but enough is enough of the same old story line.All of her books are running together!!. I keep buying her books hoping to find something new but I am always transported back to the ""older man"" ""younger woman"" theme. With either physical or emotional limitations thrown in.I love Dianna Palmer and have all of her books , but if your looking for something new you will be disappointed."
5,Truly a hopeful book.,"While almost nobody wants to read about political maneuvering, this book is about politics done right.I received this book, read it, and loaned it out - in two days. I plan to buy a few more copies to loan out to friends."
1,Is it conceiveable that aliens have stolen his soul?,"When I read Smith's Tom Paine Maru, it changed my life. In fact, most of his early works are interesting and strange. This on the other hand is didactic and slow. I can't imagine how an even moderately gifted author could possibly write something this bad. Is there any real distinction in writing a scene more wooden than the 70+ page rant from 'Atlas Shrugged?' Is it brain damage? WTF? Also, stop trying to make bizarre jokes using scrambled libertarian party member names. It isn't funny, merely sad."
4,"If Reality TV was like this, I'd watch it","I like the artist's style, so after I'd read the comic online I decided I ought to purchase it. The style is cute and slick, but really is best in black and white, rather than colour."
1,"Boring, cumbersom, and unweildly","This is a poor version of Go to the Head of the Class or Trivial Persuit without ony of the fun. It is difficult to fit the playing pieces on the spaces on the board. No creativity is allowed. Kids already get more than their share of rote memorization and parroting of answers in school. Games should be fun, this game is not."
4,Only for children,"I purchased this product for my granddaughters -age 7. They really like to interact with their parents and play the games with them for guidance and learning strategies. However, with this game they are to play with other children and the parents are to only guide not participate. The twins like the game but would prefer if their parents could provide more interaction. I wish I would have known the limitations before the purchase."
5,Brain Quest,Great game to keep your kids brain working in a fun way. The whole family plays (and I realize how much I forgot from my school days!)
3,Just OK,"I was disappointed in this book. If it's your only book on fossils, it's a decent choice. I have the DK book on fossils and I was looking for another book with more fossil pictures and descriptions. This book has a lot of general background, but it didn't live up to the hype about all those pictures. All in all, I think the DK book is better in that respect."
4,"If you like your music ""safe"" stick to Spears",The bone does what the bone wants. Not since Chim Chim have the bone unleashed mad fury ala bone styley! Do I listen to it everyday? No. Do I listen to it as much as some of my other bone favorites? No. Am I stoked as hell to have it in my collection? OH YEAH!dave
4,WARNING: This Music Not For The Mindless Spoonfed,"Under normal circumstances a 3 song ep might be consideredchicken nuggets but of course we're talking 'bout the red hotmighty FISHBONE here! 'Friendliest...' is like a 5 course mealand a doggy bag to go! Kinda like the human nervous system or is it intestines? After unraveling the many layers of music and poetry I wuz amazed that it reached all tha way to tha moon and back. In addition to Fishbone there is a wonderful familyhood ofartists that contribute to this funky little onion of an ep!If the currently underachieving music industry has left youdisenchanted , give this a try - you will catch on!WARNING: Contains free flowing funky jams,jazzy saxophone,hiphop flava and brain tweekin' spoken word poetry.Has mind expanding capabilities and may causeirreparable satisfaction!!"
1,Forgive,"This book seems to be filled with hatred and vengefulness against the Author's inlaws . While the author talks about finding God, It is my belief that she has not learned the art of forgiveness. She seems to be caught in a Soul Tie and and Stronghold with her husband. She seems to want to control him. I wonder what really drove them to such tragic unfortunate consequences. Are they both missing the message here? What drove her husband to become an adulterer, and what caused him to commit those crimes. I suspect that they were one of those couples that forgot that God was their Source and took matters into their own hands. I encourage everyone to pray for the author to learn the art of forgiveness and to purchase two books by Linda Savage on breaking down strong Holds from Amazon.com. Bothe she and her husband should study this book together (yes from Prison0 and learn how to understnad the true meaning of Breaking soul Ties. This book offers nothing to persons in similiar positions."
1,PURCHASE WITH CAUTION,Buy this board game ONLY if you can answer yes to at least one of the following questions.1. When you were young did you take pleasure in spending hours-- even days -- tinkering with old cars?2. Do you enjoy taking apart and putting together broken items -- that never manage to work again?3. Does frustration bring you happiness?4. Do you have an engineering degree?
1,Do Not Buy For Grandchildren!,"Milton Bradley has decided that quality doesn't matter in children's toys. 2 eight year olds and 2 adults playing this game can't make these poorly made pieces fit together. How frustrating for everyone! I apologized to my Grandchildren, but Milton Bradley should be apologizing to me for taking my money."
2,missing piece,I bought the game and opened it up and found out that a piece was missing..one of the cranks. I only had one. How are you going to play this game with only one crank when you need two.
2,Big Bomb!,"My son begged for this game for 2 years, Grandma finally gave in. My son was thrilled, until we opened it and realized you have to build the mousetrap as part of the game. On top of that our marbles kept getting stuck in 2 places. It might be fun to just build the trap and catch the mice (if you could get it to work), but as a game it bombed! We returned this game the next day!"
5,Hard to set up but fun to play,"This game takes a long time to set up, especially the first few times you play it, before you remember where all the pieces go. The instructions are helpful, don't let your 3-year-old lose them like mine did! The game is very fun to play, my girls play it a lot. They also love playing with the pieces instead of the actual game. My 3-yr-old plays with the diver when she plays with her loving family dollhouse like he's one of the dolls. I've found the game to be very durable, none of our pieces have broken, but our board is cracking and the slots for the pieces are worn."
2,Bought it because of advertisement,I bought this game for Christmas and wish I hadn't. It took me quite a while to set this 'game' up and I don't think my boys even made it thru one game - they became impatient or frustrated that it wasn't staying together (or that our kitties were knocking the parts around). I thought this game came set up and didn't expect such assembly. I would NOT purchase this game again - get your kids something ELSE!!
2,Not your parents Mouse Trap game,"This game is defective, compared to the Mouse Trap I played with 20+ yrs ago.The arm used to push the thing-a-ma jig no longer uses a spring, thus making it useless. 90% of the time the trap doesn't work. VERY frustrating for the kids. Also, the game uses metal balls now, which are too heavy for the hand-arm to push into the bathtub.I don't recommend purchase, unless you have a ton of patience. Your kids will have more fun with other games."
2,Doesn't offer much.,"Mousetrap doesn't offer much in the way of fun, educational value or durabilty. As far as fun goes, it's interesting enough to build the mousetrap on the board, yet it's a slow, tedious game which takes a while to get around the board to finally set the mousetrap off.As far as educational value's concerned, it doesn't really teach anyone anything. All you're doing is moving a plastic mouse around the board and building an oversized mousetrap. Also it's pretty lousy that as you're building the mousetrap, every bump sets it off or makes a piece of it fall over.And durability, well, it's not up to much wear and tear and will easily get ruined if there are kids playing it.So, Mousetrap isn't much of a game and doesn't really offer much in the way of anything and it isn't worth buying."
2,A big boring disappointment,"I have 4 children, age range 7 1/2 years to 22 months, both boys and girls. None of the children were interested in playing by the rules which are not very detailed. We have family game night every Friday night and the kids chose any other game but this one. We won't keep it."
5,MouseTrap,"I am an 11 year old and my dad bought this game for his house. I played it one day with my sister and dad at my dad's house and it was super fun! Now I have read a lot of reviews that think it is a crappy game, especially this lady that said the pieces wouldn't fit. Well, that is not true! The pieces are virtually indistructable!"
3,They just don't make them like they used too.,This game has been fun for our 7 year-old. She has enjoyed building it and playing the game.I'm dissapointed as a parent with the quality. Toys in general just don't seem to be made like they used to. The sections slid around once they were attached to the gameboard which made the end of the game pretty dissapointing because the trap wouldn't always fall. But the kids do like it and it was a fun trip down memory lane for my wife and I.
2,Big Disappointment,"The new Milton Bradley version of this game I have to say is unfortunately a big disappointment. We used to LOVE this game as kids. The new version is not made nearly as well as the one 30 years ago. We think it is VERY boring. Although the kids do think it's quite fun, if we parents can make it through it without pulling out our hair. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this."
3,"Fun for little ones, a pain for parents.","My daughter received this game as a gift this year. She was so excited and wanted to play right away. I found the directions confusing and difficult to follow at times. Once we started putting the trap together, it all came together nicely, until we began playing. We are still having difficulty getting the trap to run smoothly. Either the boot won't reach the bucket or the marble won't set off the helping hands part of the trap. I recommend saving your money on this game."
3,Cheap but not too cheerful,"The commercial makes it look so exciting, and kids WILL have fun with this game. However, be prepared to have an adult to supervise, the construction of the trap, and direct gameplay (which can be frustratingly long for younger children). Sadly, this game won't stand up to too much punishment, many small and often vital pieces are easily broken rendering the whole game useless. Having been around for so long it's getting pretty stale as well, and offers zip in the way of education - except taking turns, and fair play. Not for younger kids, and probably OK for the 7-10 range, but they probably want a computer ! It's probably time the makers of this game visited the year 2000"
3,Mousetrap Review,I was very disappointed with the game MouseTrap. It is difficult to set up for small children. My 5 year old had a hard time putting it together. My 7 year old was pretty good at the setup. The game is not sturdy enough. The basket at the end that catches the mice kept tipping over when it should not have. This frustrated the children. Cute idea for a game but needs to be reconstructed. Great that it does not take batteries.
2,Not the mousetrap game you remember,"I always enjoyed playing Mousetrap as a kid. The game setup is the same, but the pieces and mechanisms are very flimsy, cheap, and low quality. Parts do not fit on the board very well and the mechanism broke after just a couple of times setting it up. This game is a great example of a company totally sacrificing quality for the bottom line. A once fun game now compromised."
3,T O R T U R E,"As a child, I thought this game was SO fun: probably because, my brother and I would just build the trap (or try to) and just play with the pieces like a toy. I don't think we ever played the game for real. My son received this game- unsolicited - for his fifth birthday. He was elated, and I was too, at first. This game -for an adult- is Torture! Very slow moving, very repetitive, very boring and LONG. Your children will probably think it is so fun- but be forewarned- you will not. Unfortunately, young children will need your involvement to play- so you won't be getting off easily. Hopefully, you'll be as lucky as I was. You'll play it a few times, and a piece will break, rendering the game useless because it doesn't all fit together properly anymore! ahhh, what a shame...."
3,Headache in a box,"A major headache for adults, but my 5 year old daughter loves it! My daughter got this game for Christmas and wants to play it again and again. The pieces are very cheap plastic and I doubt it will stand up to very many more games. I'll continue to play it for the sake of my daughter, but I won't be disapointed when it's no longer useable."
1,Don't waste your money and dissapoint your kids!,"I fondly recalled playing with this game as a kid, and so was excited to buy it for my children. And they were very excited to build the mousetrap. But alas, the modern version of this game is a piece of junk. The pieces don't go together well, and the end result simply can't catch the mouse. The kids were very disappointed and I was annoyed to have wasted my money. I couldn't even recycle the plastic! Find the old version of the game on ebay or buy something else!"
1,This Game is Stu-pid!!!,"When I bought this mouse game it came spilling from the box. Now you know that these bosos don't even take the time to package the game properly. Then the instuctions were both in Englih and Spanish. I can read both lanuages but this was no fun playing. Then my cat eats one of the pieces and starts choking on it. This game is now a killer of humans and felines? After recusing the cat I continued playing the game. Once I got to the part were the mouse is captured the whole contraction fell apart and broke. After I was so sick of this......game I threw in the garabage. In the garbage. In the garbage. In the garbage. In the garbage. In the garbage. That is how stu-pid this ""mice of the trapps is""."
3,Limited entertainment value,"I owned this game as a child and loved it. The game itself is not very challenging or entertaining, but the mousetrap contraction was great fun. Admittedly, it did not always work as it was supposed to, but then I didn't always use it as I was supposed to either! Colorful, interesting pieces. Good concept, though poor execution. Game will probably entertain younger (6-9) children for a while, but will not have lasting entertainment value. Older children (10+) will be bored."
1,Waste of Money,"Worst game ever. You have to have the hand of a surgeon to assemble AND I do. But, still the worst game for children. Cheap quality, unstable, and impossible to ever get to the actual game since you are reassembling the board CONSTANTLY. Current status of our game after being out of the box for approximately 4 hours: BROKEN.If you DO purchase this game, buy a bottle of ADVIL as well. You'll need it for the back pain and accompanying headache that comes with the purchase. All for the low price of 18 bucks. Instead, throw your money in the fireplace and you don't even have to wait for the postman to deliver this heap. :)"
1,Not recommended. Doesn't work well. Flimsy and Frustrating.,"A piece broke during assembly (everything made of flimsy plastic). I glued it back together with a little J.B. Weld and tried again. Well, as a game it's completely worthless. But my 5 yr. old and 7 yr. old boys get some amusement out of playing with the assembled contraption, although it's very frustrating to them because it's so flimsy it generally doesn't work. Supposedly the little man is intended to be catapulted into the pool but that never happens, so the mousetrap ""basket"" rarely comes down. There must be better things to spend money on than this."
1,Junk,"Forty-five years ago this toy was made with high quality parts, and worked every time. Now, it cannot work because it no longer includes a necessary spring, and the shoddiness of the parts makes the contraption too loose to function."
4,Can't understand negative comments,"My son had this on his Santa list this year because he saw the TV ad. I had to help set it up the FIRST time and that was it from there. Even my 6 year old daughter has no problems setting the whole thing up now. I don't know how many games we played on Christmas day. Even Grandpa got in on the action.Today's homework is done and my daughter has just put the Mousetrap board together again. Ok, gotta go play now."
5,As fun as ever,I played mousetrap as a kid and now I am playing with my grandchildren. Hard to improve on a classic!
2,It's so cheap!!,"The game is kinda fun and my son loves it, but it's so cheaply built and over priced! The plastic breaks too easily, nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place. If your kids aren't asking for it, get them something else!"
3,Maybe plaster will keep it together,I saw some people playing this at a bar in a movie and it looked pretty cool so i got it for christmas I still have yet to find if its fun or not it takes an hour just to put the thing together and i had to get my friend that is in one of the most fancy engineering schools to come and put it together put even super glue couldn't keep it from toppling over!
4,As expected.,"Classic game, just as expected. The kids enjoy setting it up as much as watching the marbles move through the machine. No one actually plays the board game."
1,mouse trap not good anymore,Integral pieces of this game were missing (not even manufactured by the look of it) The mouse trap does not fit together at all (even the bits that do not rely on the missing parts) so the game cannot be used and was a huge disappointment and a complete waste of time and money (I think the freight over to Australia was more than the toy)
3,Mousetrap,Setting it up was little hard. The plastic hand part does not seem to be doing it's job correctly. I would not buy this game.
4,mousetrap,This is a favorite game of my nephews. I bought the game for his birthday because he plays my daughter's old game when he comes to visit.
1,Piece of you know what,Do not buy this version of the game. The boot does not hit the stop sign which renders the game useless.
1,"Poorly made, pieces don't fit, game doesn't work.","My son really wanted to have this game and it looked really fun on the commercials... However, the pieces don't fit together correctly and the green boot doesn't come close to hitting the yellow bucket no matter how it's manipulated. So, then I manually tip the bucket and the ball doesn't hit the hand thingy hard enough to tip the second ball... Oh, I almost forgot to mention that a few pieces were missing when purchased and we had to order replacement parts (pay for them). If you've played this game, you'd understand. It's a complete waste of time and money."
1,"Hard to put together, impossible to hold together","I sat there with my child to put this together. The instructions are terrible, and it was quite a frustrating ordeal. Everything falls apart easy. Great concept if it worked, but terrible toy."
2,Fun concept but cheap construction,"I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it. The game itself is not worth playing, but the construction part can be fun.However, the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I don't think it is worth anyone's time to play with it. Not only do the parts NOT fit, but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily. My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid, but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set."
2,Mousetrap - Boring,We have family game night every Friday. My 7 year old has been begging for this game. When he got it he was so excited. We played it as a family and was boing and most of the time it never worked properly. The one good thing about this game is that my son plays with it by putting it together and watching the marble roll and fall down. Do yourself a favor and by the traditional board games. This one is a no go.
2,"Terrible Quality, a Downgrade From the Original","Having played the original version of this game and the new one, I can safely say that they have succeeded in making an ok game horrible. The game was never that great, and always seemed to devolve into simply building the trap and running it over and over. However, now the trap doesn't even work.The game now features a small metal ball on top of the pipes instead of a large plastic one. I assume this is to cut costs since now they only have to manufacture one type of ball (two metal balls instead of a metal one and a plastic one). The problem is, the metal ball is too small and frequently missing the diving board, falls outside the poorly aligned bathtub, or is too heavy for the hand to lift.I like the new artwork, but that hardly makes up for its other failures."
4,Good for teaching kids how to follow instructions.,"I had this game when I was probably around 10 and recently bought this game for my 6 year old thinking that perhaps he might be too young for it yet. The first time, I assembled the mousetrap for him but then the next time, I read the instructions for him out loud and helped him put it together himself. He had a great time. The trap doesn't work every time but there's usually an easy fix to the problem. Any adult who knows how to read instructions should have no problem putting the mousetrap together and should be able to help their kids suceed with the game."
1,Disappointing!,"My son received this game for Christmas last year. We assembled and played it once. After that it remained on his bedroom floor - still assembled - for a few weeks. Then, since I was tired of vacuuming around it, and he was not interested in playing it, I disassembled it and put it away. It hasn't been mentioned or thought of since! He was frustrated because none of the parts worked exactly as they should. Mousetrap is a toy that in theory is pretty cool, and could teach kids about cause & effect, but in practice, just doesn't work! Though the makers may have intended for kids to actively take part in the assembly to learn building skills, I don't believe that most kids have the patience or the (extremely)fine motor skills required to set this game up!"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS NEW!,"I purchased this game for $4.00 at a thrift store, and all pieces are present in like new condition. It's certainly not worth any more money than that. The parts do not all fit together well, but the children enjoy working the contraption. I do NOT recommend this game. The plastic parts are flimsy. I see why someone 'donated' this to the thrift shop. It's not fully functional!"
4,fun but not durable,"My son loves this toy, BUT he broke a piece of it within the second day of getting it for a gift as he fell on the board and broke one of the plastic pieces. I doubt this one will last long in our house despite it being one of my favorite kid toys from my childhood."
3,Different than I remember,I had this game as a kid. My kids love it but the pieces are really flimsy and easy to break.
2,VERY CHEAP!,"I ordered this due to memories of the game when I was a kid. There were reviews that I ignored about the quality, so it's my fault. The game is frustrating for the kids to do since the pieces don't go together well. This isn't the games we had as a kid. Don't waste your money."
2,frustration!,"That should be what it is called!It looks like a really cute,fun game but...at least the versions here in Australia--are so hard to use because the Mouse Trap keeps falling apart.It needs to be made better."
2,Almost worthless...,We got this game for our girls last Christmas thinking it would be fun. This is NOTHING like the one from when we were kids. It's not real sturdy and it's way too complicated for younger kids. It's a pain in the patuti to put together and when you get it put together it may work a couple of times before it gets scooted apart and have to be re-adjusted. The kids dont even pay attention to the game part they just like to play with the pieces. My youngest likes to turn the crank and launch the man into the bathtub but it requires a lot of work just to get that to happen. The kids can't play with it unless one of us is right there with them. It stays in the closet on the shelf most of the time.
2,Too flimsy,"I don't know if the construction of this has changed since I was little. The pieces are so cheap and flimsy, one broke while we were removing it (carefully) from the packaging. We tried tape and glue and it won't stay together well. My kids still tried to play it but soon got frustrated at how poorly it works. Looks so fun but isn't."
3,pieces don't link well together,"The idea of this game is good....take turns building the mouse trap and trap a mouse at the end. But, despite the # of years this game has been around, I think it needs to be overhauled! The pieces must link together securely for the ball to follow a path that will eventually capture a mouse. But I had to use some sticky mount to get the pieces to fit into the holes on the board and stay put. My kids had fun after I put it together and just rolled the ball through the contraption."
2,4 COPS AND A FUNERAL,"After a cop is killed, his partners decide the system for convicting criminals doesn't work. They believe if they had ""20 funerals"" that would clean up the town of criminals and just leave bad actors with a terrible cliche filled script. I kept expecting Steven Seagal to pop in. It was that bad. Didn't they do this in ""Magnum Force?"" Filmed in Atlanta.The film drags on even though there is action and killing. Of course things don't go as planned. I would sooner sit through a Seagal or Austin movie than to watch this again.F-bomb, brief sex, brief stripper nudity. 2 stars is generous."
3,Pretty Good little film,"I got a screener copy of this movie. A very violent, very funny movie. It kind of feels like Boondock Saints or Resevoir Dogs. A lot of graphic violence kind of played for laughs. Far more entertaining than i thought it would be. Lots of rappers in it, all of them having a lot of fun with their parts."
1,DO NOT! waste your time or money on this movie.,"I do not know what these people were on, when giving this movie 4 or 5 stars. This movie seems to have been made on a $5 budget and filmed/directed by an 8 year old using a handicam. The ""action"" scenes if you want to call it that are just lame and no special/effects whatsoever (just blobs of ketchup).There is not a single minute in this movie that is worth watching........"
5,Pharmagel Hydra Cleanse Facial cleanser,"Looking for a alternative to Obagi which is overpriced, I noticed this and since it has great reviews I bought it, glad i did it is great cleanser!"
4,Good Improvement!,"Rihanna has really impressed me with this album! First off, ""S.O.S"" is a killer dance song which has already achieved great success on the radio. And her second single, ""Unfaithful"" is a pretty slow song that showcases her voice. What I like a lot more with this album compared to her debut, ""Music Of The Sun"" is that the slow songs work more on this album. On her last album, all I could listen to were the dance tracks but everything else was mediocore. With this album, Rihanna delivers on good R&B; songs like ""(P.S) I'm Still Not Over You"" and ""Final Goodbye.""The reggae songs are really catchy once again on this album. ""Dem Haters"" and ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" show that Rihanna was born and raised in Barbados. Overall, it is a catchy CD. If you didn't like ""Music Of The Sun"" this is definitly a step up!"
4,Good CD!,"I loved Rihanna's last CD Music of the Sun and I just couldn't wait for this one to drop. This album is definitly a step up from Music of the Sun. My favorite songs are We Ride, Kisses Don't Lie, SOS (Rescue Me), Unfaithful, and If It's Lovin' That You Want (Part 2). If you liked, just liked Music of the Sun you will love A Girl Like Me."
4,Miss Thing is gonna be HUGE!,"Girl, you may not be as good as Beyonce or Ashanti, but you have promise and I like your album, okay? This CD has some good beats and great songs. You need to support Miss Girl, because she has MAD TALENT!"
3,a girl like me-rihanna cd,"i bought a cd that was said to be new, and great condition, though the cd, was scratched from tracks 11-13, where one of the songs was my favorite."
2,Rihanna plz help this album,"If i could i would give this album 2.5 stars reason is because for a sophomore album for her, its not very good at all. In this album, Rihanna barely hits the Reggae genre but trys to show that she is also capiable of doing R&B. Some of tracks are somewhat boring and not too many i would really consider being ""Club Bangers"" unlike her debut album ""Music Of The Sun"" which had some nice cuts on it. But she is one to watch, she very pretty and has a somewhat nice voice, given time we will see what happens with Miss. Rihanna!!!"
4,WORTH THE BUY,"Rihanna has shown maturity over her previous album. My fav. songs are SOS, Unfaithful, Kisses Don't Lie, Dem Haters, Break it off, We Ride, Crazy Thing Called Love. There is something on the album for everyone as it does not cover any one genre. I am particular looking for the release of Kisses Don't Lie as it is a fusion of ROCK and REGGAE ( very interesting)."
1,another boring and lame album by rihanna,this album seriously stinks its boring and lame and yes this album is one big epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i hate this album and i hate this artist with a firey passion she brings nothing new to the music industry
1,Not nearly as good as Good Girl Gone Bad. Not even close.,"I really liked Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad CD. Not just the hit single Umbrella but the whole album, so I ordered a copy of her previous release, A Girl Like Me. I was disappointed, as the only good track on this one IS the hit single, SOS. A Girl Like Me has a less-urban feel, and is musically immature compared to her following release. It's not ""bad"" music really, but not what I had hoped for. OK really it is bad music except for SOS. While Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad is a pop masterpiece, A Girl Like Me is lackluster and just plain dull, lacking the hooks the vocals and the lyrical content that made her later album successful."
1,"Fed Up is wrong, Rhianna deserves coconuts not praise!","Blue Racer: Someone tell this *r*ng*t*n named Rhianna that she cannot sing. Japanese Beetle: She is just another pretty face who is all T*ts and *ss and no music talent. Blue Racer: Men buy this album because either they are G*y(like Fed Up) or want to, as Prince aptly put it, ""get off"" looking at the cover, Japanese Beetle: I don't think she is worth the price of tea in Japan, HAASAH(karate chops her head)!!! SAYONARA!"
1,"RORY GALLAGHER just called,he want's his song title back",A girl like me is utter tripe.This woman has desecrated a great rock song A MILLION MILES AWAY from the great Rory Gallagher by turning it in to a crappy dance number.The other songs are awful too.Stay far away from this terrible album.Get any RORY GALLAGHER album instead.
1,New Iron Maiden album coming out soon,"Rihanna is atrocious,bad,horrible,crap,trash and Plain lousy and is as bad as Beyonce,Britney and Ciara.You will lose respect in society by buying this awful album.PLEASE AVOID THIS ALBUM.Please wait for the new IRON MAIDEN album which will be released shortly."
3,"I Like ""SOS"" & I Love ""Unfaithful""...","I don't have this album. But, I do like the hit singles from it. ""SOS"" is pretty decant & I LOVE, LOVE ""Unfaithful"" - it's awesome! Rihanna is such beautiful! And very talented..."
4,"3.5 stars, she's a fresh new artist","when pon de replay came out I thought she would be forgotten after despite having a decent album with cool jams on it. Then out of nowhere came the energetic SOS rescue me single which blew up everywhere and she had a new image as well. Then the beautiful ne yo written ballad unfaithful was released and I had to check out the rest of the CD. It has a lot of r&b/reggae/pop fusion tracks in addition to beautiful ballads containing piano and guitar melodic hooks over carefully sung vocals that contain elements of reggae and soul as well. She's become a very creative musical artist, an amazing feat to accomplish. She reminds me a lot of beyonce vocally but with more energy and more singable melodies than her. Definitely check this out if you want hot summer jams to listen to. You can blast this at a barbecue or picnic or in the car among the sunshine and I can guarantee that ""a girl like her"" will entertain you."
3,Reasonable,"well, I classify as reasonable. Some good music, but for whom is it worth fan.I recommend. This time it arrived well before the estimated time."
3,A Girl Like Me - More Reggae sound than dance sound,"I bought this DVD for the song SOS.. and it is great. I was hoping for more fast beat songs like that, but instead there are a lot of songs with a reggae beat. I do like Reggae too.. so that's not a bad thing.. it's just not what I was expecting. There are a couple of slow songs on there too. Overall.. a decent purchase."
4,Get Used To It After A While,"At first, the only songs I listened to were the singles and Final Goodbye. But after about a 2 weeks, I finally was able to luv the whole album. I don't know why it took so long to grow on me, but that's just the way it is. Now, my favorite songs are definitly Final Goodbye, A Girl Like Me, and If It's Lovin' That You Want, Pt. 2."
5,A solid album from Rihanna,"This album is incredibly solid, and it deserves alot more attention than her debut. Songs like ""Break It Off"" f/ Sean Paul and ""SOS"" have you dancing, while ballads like ""Final Goodbye"" and ""A Million Miles Away"" have you thinking. The production on this album is done very well, and I wish Rihanna success.""SOS"" - 10/10""Kisses Don't Lie"" - 8/10""Unfaithful - 10/10""We Ride"" - 10/10""Dem Haters"" - 7/10""Final Goodbye"" - 9/10""Break It Off"" - 8/10""Crazy Little Thing Called Love - 6/10""Selfish Girl"" - 5/10""P.S (I'm Still Not Over You) - 9/10""A Girl Like Me"" - 6/10""A Million Miles Away"" - 9/10""If It's Lovin' That You Want pt. 2"" - 5/10"
1,delan,"What a bad singer, she only mumbles and more sounds comes out of her nose than her mouth. If someone like her can record on cdit means anybody can do it even if you don't have any voice."
1,omg,This woman has the most annoying voice in the world! it out annoys just about anyone...its like sumone stuck ear plugs up her nose...no effin whinny...she barely has any range and if u listen to her on the AOL sessions she cant even sustain notes for longer than 2 seconds... either that or she goes falsetto which is almost cheating...
1,TRASH,RIHANNA CANNOT SANG'....I DON'T KNOW WHAT JAY-Z TRYING TO DO BUT HER ABILITY TO PUT MUSICAL NOTES WITH HER VOICE NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED AND RE-WORKED. THIS IS SO DAMN LATE!!!!! SOS IS THE ONLY GOOD TRACK AND THAT IN ITSELF IS MEDICORE...I WON'T EVEN BASH THIS ALBUM ANYMORE IT IS HORRIBLE PLEASE LEAVE A GIRL LIKE HER ON THE SHELF.
3,Please Stick to Dancehall...,"This album is pretty wack. Music of the Sun was a much better album and was more directly connected with her roots. This album was more of her trying to crossover in the pop world, but she sucks when it comes to ballads. "" Unfaithful"" was the only decent ballad on the CD. ""We Ride"", S.O.S."", and ""Dem Hatas"" are the best tracks. ""Break it Off"" should have been on Sean Paul's album because its basically his track all she does is sing the bridge and hook. Rihanna, if you want to keep your ""colored"" audience, use the formula for Music of the Sun and stick to it."
4,No sophomore slump here :-),"This is a fairly good cd. I really like her voice and she has a good range. The songs on here are good and probably going to make a few more top 10 hits yet.I like the regae sounds in Crazy Little Thing Called Love, I like the nice ballad Final Goodbye (good vocals in that song), S.O.S (which admittedly is now way overplayed but still an excellent song) and while Unfaithful is a good song, I prefer the remix to it.Hot on the heels of her debut sucess, if she keeps up this kind of pace and makes equally good music like that that is on here, she will be around for a while to come. She shows no signs of the sophomore slump that other artists can sometimes go through. It's no wonder this cd has gone platinum, it really is quite good and people with varied tastes in music will find something in here for them."
2,"Weak album, Weak voice- A step down from Music of the sun","Ok..now she's from my country and I'll be honest. She's not a great singer and her vocal range is not there.Now to the album.This is an uneven album and Rihanna needs to cut her niche and find out what she's better at doing. These albums with 2 hiphop songs along with 2 R&B; tunes and 2 reggae dancehall tracks accompanied by 2-3 remixes only make the listener confused as to what the artiste is trying to say-I certainly was.This is not a standout album, in fact it's average and just like any of the stuff any of these girls push out year in and year out.It's ok to have a well made-up face on the disc cover but it's all about the quality of the material on the disc that gets the buyer going.I'm glad that this young woman has made it unto the big market but it's time she pratices her craft,cultivate her voice and make some memorable music."
4,Great songs,"The CD is full of catchy songs. I especially like Unfaithful. Although not as well written, some lyrics do sound a little off, it is well sung and Rihanna's voice gives it that extra something that makes the song so addictive."
5,love it,I play it all the time. Some of the song I thought was Beyonce after buying this CD I relized it was Rihanna all along. She sounds like Beyonce when she sings.
3,expected more,I like Rhianna as a person i think that she is beautiful on the inside and out. However i did expect more from her album.Maybe i need to listen to it more. I must admit it does take time for me to like a song. However I wish her well.
4,Awesome!,"This is a great cd that just puts you in a good mood. The best songs are SOS, Kisses Don't Lie, Unfaithful, We Ride, Final Goodbye, and Break It Off. We Ride is definitely the best song of them all!! I love it!!! If you like Rihanna you'll love this cd."
5,One of my favorite movies!,It's beautifully shot. The actors are awesome. It's a great story. I think it is one of the best movies ever!
3,Real stories of deadly encounters,"This book tells true stories of cops who have had to use deadly force in their line of duty. Although all of the stories handle encounters where someone is killed, this book does not glorify use of deadly force, or try to over dramatize the situations. The stories have very realistic feel, and most of the stories are not very exciting (but are still interesting). So if you are looking for exciting cop stories and Hollywood-style heroics, you should look elsewhere.There are over 30 stories, most of which are 5-10 pages long. Therefore, you can pick this book up if you have 15 minutes to spare. Sadly, the narration is not of very high quality, but rather reminds of trashy pulp fiction books. Anyway, if you are looking for realistic depictions of police work that does not demand too much effort to read, this book might fill the bill."
4,Interesting...,"I thought this book was written a little differently, but I also found it helpful. It was cool how Sojourner Truth's Book of Life was written inside of it along with a whole separate book. There was a lot of good information in it. I used this book for a school project and it worked out great. The book was useful and interesting to read because there are letters from people she knew that were written to her. I enjoyed reading this also recieved info from it."
5,This as close to live RJ as you can get!,"RJ Mischo puts on an amazing, live blues show and this is the next best thing to being there. Try it, you won't be sorry!"
3,Good book,"Good book and at a great value. Took quite a while to get to me. It was scheduled to arrive in 7 to 14 days, it took it 14 days to arrive."
5,Social Alienation at 8.69.,"Before I bought this soundtrack, I had too many friends. My college social life was far too much of a weight to carry. So, I made full use of this product, by playing it for everyone I know. Now I have no friends, and everybody avoids me. Peace of mind has never been so cheap. Thank you, Tommy Wiseau."
4,This CD Will Tear You Apart!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present. I absolutely love The Room! It's one of the best worst movies ever. This CD has every single song and background music from the movie. I love the main theme, and the awkward love songs like I Will, and You Are My Rose. If you love the movie, you'll love THE ROOM SOUNDTRACK!!!"
2,"A soundtrack?! You must be kiddin' me, aren't you?","So, the cult classic ""The Room"" is distinguishable by the dreamy, strange and ""The Legend of Zelda"" -like theme music, which is featured unabridged on this CD. This album exclusively features the cheesy rhythm and blues songs such as ""You Are My Rose"" and ""I Will,"" which were featured in infamous sex scenes and end credits in the film. Snicker at the silly, simple yet at least comprehensible ""You Are My Rose"" and cringe and laugh at the ridiculous ""I Will,"" which teaches us that love is not defined by care or sweet gestures but standing in the way of bullets and running through wildfires. Scoff all you wish, but you may start dancing to these songs with your future wife and/or future husband."
2,Red color is more pink than red,The quality was good. The size was good. The problem was with the color. I ordered red. It is really pink-red. I did not want a pink collar for my male dog. The bright red shown on the advertised picture is not the actual color.
2,what you see is not what you get here,"I bought a more expensive model that looks exactly like the one in the picture, so I thought this was a good deal for a 6 dollars but as it turns out the toy shown in this picture is not what you will get; instead you will recieve one that does not have posable legs or arms, and that has rather shabby everything having the feel of a Mcdonald's happy meal toy."
4,needs an update,"It is now 8 years since this book came out. China has continued to astonish the world with its rapid growth, which certainly does not exclude its banking system. Under these circumstances, an update of this book would be timely.The issues discussed are still germane. Though today's numbers would be expected to be larger. As I write this, just a few days ago, a major Chinese bank had a very successful IPO. It appears that the key issue of bad loans is being gradually ameliorated by policies of the major banks and, implicitly, by the Chinese government, through repeated capital injections."
2,Good for light trimming,"On the positive side, I liked the design of this groomer as well as the nice storage box. I did not experience any problem with attaching/removing attachments, like other reviewers have.In terms of actually using this groomer for trimming, I'm quite disappointed. I bought this trimmer hoping to trim my beard very short. It seems that the spacers are not meant to be used with a short beard, since they do not trim it. On the other hand, using the trimmer without any spacer, almost shaves my beard completely and that is not what I want.Another major drawback with this groomer is that the battery drains too quickly. More importantly, when the battery is empty, even if the groomer is attached to a wall socket it does not bypass the battery but rather tries to recharge it again which is of course hopeless when using the trimmer."
4,karey,"Great for the price. Everything works well. I really like the foil shaver, After fist trimming my beard low, I use the foil head to get it very close with no bumps (I have a thick curly beard) I've had it six months now and its still going strong. My only complaint is that you can't use it corded if the battery runs low."
2,Nearly useless for beard trimming,"My always faithful Remington MB-40 died after 10 years of weekly use, so I picked up this set as a replacement. The guard wasn't very useful and the beard hair slipped under it, cutting way too close. It felt cheap and wasn't comfortable to hold. It also completely jammed several times and pulling it apart to clear it was difficult.The hair clippers or other attachments might work, but this was unusable for me and I wish I could have my MB-40 working."
3,"Not bad, but...",I too am online looking for a new trimmer because this Titanium is no longer even useful. It has always tended to pull hair even to the point of feeling like it has built in tweezers yanking hairs out. The nose hair and shaver attachments were always worthless. Battery life was decent. As soon as the blades began to dull a bit it went from being marginally ok for the cheap price to unuseable.
1,"Junk, pure and simple","Unlike several other reviewers, I loved this trimmer for 5 months. At that time the rechargeable battery just died completely, would not recharge at all, and the Remington people are useless when filing a complaint"
2,Suitable for occasional use,"I have had this razor for a year, it works well on the face and neck so long as you hold it at a good angle, it hasnt broken in a years time, however it battery life has gone down the tubes, after a full 24 hours charging i get about 10-15 mins use before it starts snagging and pulling hair out, WARNING not at all suited for shaving below the neck line!"
2,Low Quality Trimmer,"Remington's cost cutting went a little too far with this model. My main complaint is that the trimmer is very flimsy and cheaply made. It lasted a few months before the plastic trimmer attachment broke. Once I started using this, I knew it was only a matter of time before it broke. Also, the plastic base/holster is just pointless. If you're looking for a beard trimmer, you should probably keep looking."
4,Remington groomer,"This was a replacement for my old groomer of the same brand. I have been very satisfied with the old groomer, and the new one seems to be equally satisfactory"
3,"Better then others, but","I've owned this shaver, PG250, for some time now. The price was good for all the attachments and I see it in stores all the time now. With that said, I'm finding it very difficult to locate a replacement screen & foil for the little shaver that comes with it. The trimmers are sharp enough but, the length adjustment keeps slipping and thus cuts my hair to short. I like that it's rechargable not a battery you have to replace affter every shave."
1,Keeping Christ in Christmas,"It shocked me to discover many of the facts and phrases in this book lifted verbatim or altered only slightly from The Everything Christmas Book, published 2 years prior to Keeping Christ in Christmas. I wrote to the author in 2000, and he/his publisher said, in essence, this was okay, because the information was in the public domain/commonly known or something to that effect. If it's so commonly known, you don't need this book. If you want a more honest book, I recommend The Everything Christmas Book."
5,The Greatest Band in the world!,"Interesting, and Fun and verry funny but the sad thing its just 30mimutes!"
2,Not tough enough,Bought this because the reviews were raving about this being award winningly tough. We received it this morning and he's already chewed a big piece off in a matter of hours...not impressed!
4,Very Durable,The Planet Dog Obee- Tuff Football seems to hold up very well to my boxers abuse. I can't say this about many products. Most of the so called indestructible toys are gone within a couple of days but not this one. So far after a few weeks the only piece of the football he has managed to destroy have been the glued on laces which took him 15 minutes. So all in all I would recommend this product
4,Sturdy toy,"I bought this toy because I thought that my 2 terrier mix dogs would enjoy fetching and retrieving it. Also, because there is a hole in one end which I thought was to hold treats, therefore they would be more interested in chasing the football. My younger terrier, emptied all the treats out of the ball in less than 10 seconds and lost interest. Maybe that's not what the hole was for. Anyway, this is an extremely tough toy that will last them a long time. It bounces crazily when it hits the ground and the dogs cannot figure out where it will land, so it keeps them moving a little more."
3,Bouncy & Tough,"I bought this toy for my high energy lab and mix terrier. They both weren't so thrilled by it. I think the size of the football makes it difficult for my lab to hold onto with his mouth. However, they do enjoy chasing after it because the ball bounces around quite a bit. The ball is quite sturdy also and floats pretty well in swimming pool."
4,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Football,"My dogs and I really love this ball! It is Orbee-Tuff and can really take a beating. It is the perfect size to fit into my German Shepherds' mouths. However, I only use this ball for playing catch, I don't leave it for them to chew on. I can already tell that they might be able to chew pieces off, if given the opportunity. But if you do not have a destructive chewer, this ball would be a perfect toy to leave with them :)"
4,A Great And Fun Toy For Your Four Legged Half Back,"Planted Orbee has quickley become one of our favorite line of dog toys. The designs are innovative and fun and the toys hold up extremley well. I would say they are on par with other favorites such as Kong and Nylabone. Our oldest Bulldog goes NUTS for sny sports ball. Be it a baseball, soccer ball or basketball. Scaled down to his size in a toy - or full size Harley is crazy for them and this football is no exception.The football is great for throwing around with your pooch and can hold up to a good chew, however agressive chewers with lots of determination will have no problem getting through this thing like a hacksaw and reducing it to shreds. That said for most ""noraml' chewers the football hlds up well an should provide hours of fun for most any pooch. Like all toys of this nature keeping an eye on your best friend while chomping on it is a good idea.5 paws up!"
4,Great toy!,This ball has made it a month in my house with my very mouthy yellow lab (1 year old) the only thing she managed to destroy from it was the white plastic laces- not the best design in my opinion for a dog toy but oh well. I would definetly reccomend this toy for any dog. She just loves to play catch with it and to sit and chew on it. Worth the money in my opinion.
3,Planet dog football,"My 2 yr old golden destroyed the ball in 1 day. She was able to pull it apart at the opening on the tip of the football. She hasn't been able to destroy the Planet Dog snowball, diamond plated ball or glow in the dark orbee. The 5 chomper rating seems to be pretty accurate with these toys. The football was a 4 chomper. The football is a good outdoor retrieving toy, but not good for constant chewing."
3,Lasted 10 minutes,"As my title stated, this lasted about 10 minutes before it was a pile of ""Orbee-Tuff"" rubber. I rated it 3 stars because that is actually pretty average with my pit-bull and she definitely enjoyed it. I have been shopping online for toys that match the durability of the Kong Extreme series. The Amazon site (at least at time of purchase) made no mention of the ""4 out of 5 chompers"" rating or I likely would not have purchased. Luckily it is guaranteed 100%. I will exchange for their ""Orbee-Tuff"" ball, which seems to be stronger. Some other reviews rate this as indestructible, which may be true for dogs with less strength. For those of us with extremely strong-jawed dogs I recommend this only as a fetch toy."
1,28402 Lund Insert,I had to return this insert as it was the wrong one in the box. The product did not fit my vehicle.
2,Ugh... a USED toothbrush?,"It appears this is a great toothbrush, but I won't be using it- Although I paid (a lot) for new merchandise, and although the policy states these items can't be returned, SOMEHOW I received a toothbrush that's already been opened.(The outer wrap is missing, part of the box has been torn away, and the internal contents seem to have been repackaged).Thankfully, Amazon was very good about resolving the issue. I really appreciate that. I do hope to acquire this toothbrush soon and give it a real try."
4,A decent 1st interview,"This was supposedly Wilber's first authorized audio interview. It is of course a very brief intro to his ideas, and great if you are new to him. There are some interesting personal information that he shares as well.If you want more though, then you need to obtain ""Kosmic Consciousness"" (7 CD's) from Sounds True. A much more intense course on his various topics. Great for putting on your iPod for those long road trips.(I swear i am not related to any company, nor am i trying to endorse any of them.)I have been reading Wilber for about 3 years, and hearing him has been interesting, to get to know the man behind the thoughts a little bit better.As part of his Integral Institute, he is now giving lectures (something he said he would never do), in Boulder, CO. I look forward to enrolling.Best of luck on your search and journey...."
2,"Looks cheap, not worth buying","I bought this when Amazon had it on sale for $29.40. Seemed like a nice bag and for the price could be a steal. It reminded me a lot of the B. Makowsky Oxford Satchel (which I happen to already own). When the package arrived and I looked at the bag, I was not impressed. While the design and style looks nice, the fake leather material looks like pleather and doesn't feel good at all. In addition, the color is horrible as well. The bag looks cheaply made and is not worth buying. Sorry Amazon and Rampage, this bag is going back."
3,Inuyasha wall scroll,"I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas 2011. The shipping was great, and in a timely manner. The item its self was in New condition, as promised. The only issue I have with it, is for what I paid it did NOT come complete. There was nothing on the ends of the wall scroll, from which it should hang, nor did it come with the string it was suppose to. Luckly wall scrolls are easy to make it work, just disappointed it didnt come ready to hang. So over all I would rate the product as a ""3"" because anyone that pays for anything expects it to be complete. Especially when I can order it local and if it doesnt come complete I can get it exchanged for what I paid for."
2,Don't buy it for a younger child!,My 4 year old can't play this game and I doubt any 3 year old could play it properly. You have to draw the clues for other players to see and children that age can't draw very well. It is more entertaining for the adults that have to play with the child. And everyone else is right - all those little cards are a hassle.
4,Fun for kids,"This is a good game, though I agree with other reviews that the puzzle cards are a pain. We just keep them in order in a stack secured by a rubber band. Yes, they escape now and then, but my 4 1/2 year old loves this game after a year and a half of owning it. The puzzles are fun to figure out, and he likes doing the actions when he lands on action spaces."
4,Southern Mystery at its Best,A great collection of short stories. Southern mysteries by some of the best mystery short story writers around. Each story is charming and entertaining. A wonderful American take on the English-type mystery. Enjoy!
5,Educational Game worth the time,"My husband teaches sixth grade and they study Egypt. He uses this game in the classroom and the students love it. We have also played this game in our home with our own children. They also loved it. It is not a game that can just be thrown at the children and expect them to understand it. Parents will need to actually spend time with their children and help them learn it. Once they understand it, they will have no problem playing it by themselves. It can be a very fun, competitive game."
3,Mummy Rummy,Got this for a family with a young boy. They like it but aren't as enthused about it as they were with Loot. Play Loot all the time. Seems a little complicated.
5,Fabulosa,"I just finished this wonderful and brilliant novel. The writing was superb, and the story was both original and accessible. But what made it great was the passion, which was laser-like in its clarity and intensity. I did not so much read this book as inhale it. Madrigal has written love scenes that inspire melt-down in the reader without describing a body part or move, just the pure distilled emotion of the encounter. They were beautiful. This book may be more universal than she knows. I couldn't be more other than gay or Mexican, but I sure understand about being an outsider, and about hiding things that made me very happy from my mom...for decades. On that level I got all of it. And love is love. It's the only thing that's real and the only thing that counts, in any form."
3,Red Hot..Jazz not Blues,"I like this album. Alexis Korner is reputed to be the Godfather of English blues but from what I hear on this and other Korner CDs is Jazz. If you are a true believer of English Blues then listen to early John Mayall, Early Chicken Shack and the first few albums by Fleetwood Mac when Peter Green was still the frontman for the group. These are all great blues albums and I play them to death. ""Red Hot from Alex"" is jazz with a bit of blues influence. If you like jazz, and thankfully I do then this is not a bad album to add to your collection. Blues purists may not be so impressed. My only real bone of contention with this CD is that it is mainly instrumental. I think a few more songs would have made this a great album.Charles"
2,Shop Carefully!! (Good for taking a few dolls along.),"This is about 1/2 the size I expected. I did not carefully read the dimensions stated in the description. Don't make the same mistake! My daughter hasn't received it, yet - so I'll review it again after she has.Now that my 6yr old daughter has had this a while, I'll review again. Though is is small, it will hold 1-2 dolls and a few outfits. Because of the carrying handle, it is good for taking along. We have not had the same issues with the lid as others. The swing-out drawers at the bottom are a bit difficult to open, but may loosen up after more use. This little case does make it out fairly often, so I think it was a worthwhile purchase overall. If I could, I'd give it 3 stars for Fun and 3 for Overall."
1,WHY!?!?,"this manga was absolutely horrible.....from the characters to the the over complicated drawings ..the whole story was simply disgraceful. It would of benn alitlle bit better...well maybe a WHOLE lot better if the main character wouldnt say ""SU"" all the time and if her dress wasnt so out of place ..theres a difference between over doing it and being different...also the height differences scared me the characters overreacted way too much at everything the angel was a complete idiot and spacey too much..the plot was...over done...dry..boring..im actually surprised that i took the time to read the whole thing...im just sad now that i wasted ten bucks and to think i could of bought a really good book like fruits baket or my fav hana-kimi ...i wouldnt buy this book called pita-ten unless you have no iq"
1,"No sir, I just don't like it!","Sorry people, but this is definitely NOT the book for me. Not enough Charlie, loads of Phil Duncan whose voice irritates me. Don't like the tunes, absolutely ghastly programming on the backing. So wish I hadn't bought this book. Don't get me wrong, I think you're amazing Charlie, I just wish I'd bought one of your albums instead."
5,we've had one for years and it's great,We have had Simon for years and every one has loved playing it. Great hand/eye cooridnation.
4,Fun for all.,Great toy. I enjoyed a lot when was kid. Now my kids are playing and having fun with it too. Very funny and educational. Some kind of fragile but nice.
5,Hope for the future,"The first part of this book on the art of co-operation interested me the most. Mr. Creme connects two central problems the world faces today: the economic crisis and the question of war and peace. He shows how the unequal distribution of resources in the world creates social tensions with risk of war. This dangerous situation can be overcome by replacing competition by co-operation. This would mean a total transformation of our economic structures. But according to Mr. Creme, in the long run this is possible. This gives hope for a safer and happier future for all humanity."
3,Good Beginning,"This was my first book on JavaScript and found it to be a major help. As other people noted, it was not referenced well. Also, too many examples contained incomplete information that ""would be explained later."" Chapter 7, Operators, was poorly done. Written primarily for Netscape browser preferences."
3,"Good, but not advanced","This was a fairly good beginners to intermediate book. However, a lot of the material was directly copied from the Netscape Developer's Web page, so you don't need to waste your money buying this book. It is primarily for Netscape, and doesn't give much coverage on IE. Overall a good reference book, but not really worth the money."
3,I was expecting new. Start reading descriptions better.,My fault for not reading description better. Seller never advertised item as new. Screwdrivers and knife was rusty. Items looked old. If these items are new they've been sitting around for quite a while. Shipping was very quick ;)
5,Watch Battery Tools,I purchased the tools so my wife could replace watch batteries herself. She has had no issues with the tools and has already replaced 9 batteries in her many watches - big cost savings over batteries plus.
1,battery replacment kit,Do not recommend buying the battery replacment kit. The tools are a cheap and not worth what I paid for them.
4,decent replacement,"I looked long and hard to find replacement plunger assemblies for two pitcher pumps I use on my homestead. The metal part of the original pumps that secures the leather is a light weight alloy and corrodes quickly making disassembly difficult when the piston fails. These assemblies fit well, and are available, and seem solid enough to last a few more years, and that is about all I could hope for."
3,Poor MacMillan,"Mayerling is one of the most intense ballets I have ever seen and Kenneth MacMillans choreography is superb (as allways). This reccording though is very lacking. The cast is excellent (including such stars as Irek Mukhamedov, Viviana Durante and Darcey Bussell, Lesley Collier) and all give wonderfull performances, but the camera angles and the frequent close-ups ruin many of the scenes - especially the dramatic and very high energy pas de deux between Prince Rudolf (Irek Mukhamedov) and his new wife Princess Stephanie (Jane Burn). This pas de deux is quite violent and covers huge areas of the stage. The movement and energy is compleatly lost in shots of faces, hands etc. As the only reccording of the ballet it is still worth having though."
3,"A Must-See, But Not For Beginners","I personally do not own nor have seen this dvd. But don't stop reading because of that! I saw the ballet live a few months ago, and was shock and appalled and enjoyed it immensely. But inbetween scenes, I had to stop and examine the plotline in the program to understand what had just happened, so if you're not terribly familiar with the ballet, I don't recommend seeing it without first doing some research. It's an incredible ballet, but lock up the kids--this is not for innocent eyes, and also probably not a good started for those new to the ballet world. I hear there are many close-ups on this dvd, and this is a tragedy, as ballet is meant to be seen on a full stage. Even sitting in the nose-bleed section, I was still greatly affected by the emotions on-stage, even if I couldn't see the dancers faces clearly. For the sake of culture and education, I hope everyone that sees this dvd to greatly enjoy it, but if you get the chance to see it live, do it!"
1,My last one-click purchase,"I ordered a six-ounce, $5.95 product and was charged $7.15 for shipping and handling. I used one-click purchase because it's so handy, and once I saw the shipping cost, I emailed them to cancel the order. I never heard another word from them -- even the packing slip didn't mention the outrageous shipping charge. It did arrive quickly but I would never buy anything from this company again and I'll stick to Amazon only for one-click purchases."
2,Plastic Bag Hanger,The arms are too short so that the bag isn't held open wide enough to drop trash in.
2,Not what I need,"The item was exactly what was advertised, but is far too narrow when mounted to practically throw trash into. Oh well."
5,A LOOK INTO CHILD PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,"THIS IS A VERY TOUCHING BOOK OF CASE STORIES ABOUT CHILDREN WITH DISORDERS. EACH CHAPTER IS A DIFFERENT CASE STORY DEALING WITH CHILD PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. THE STORIES ARE SOMETIMES SAD BUT REALLY WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TERRIBLE TRAMA MANY OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE TO GO THROUGH GROWING UP. TAKING A LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT THE CHILDREN LIVE IN, THE WAY THEY ARE TALKED TO AND THE OTHERS ARE TALKED TO IN THE HOUSE, MAKES A PERSON REALIZE THAT OFTEN THE PROBLEMS WE SEE IN CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY THE CAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS.EACH CHAPTER HAS A SECTION ON ASSESSMENT, TREATMENT, ETC., FROM THE THERAPIST POINT OF VIEW. IT REFERS TO THE DSM-IV AND LIST THE CRITEREA FOR DIAGNOSIS.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT CHILDREN AND ANYONE WHO HAD SOME TYPE OF TRAUMA GROWING UP. I ALSO RECOMMEND IT TO PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS OR ANYONE INTERESTED IN PSYCHOLOGY."
4,Fast,The book was delivered incredibly fast which I appreciated. Wouldn't mind doing business with them again. Great seller.
4,Be Your Own Emperor,"Michael Gerber does not put much credence in the oodles of management and leadership theory and teachings that fill today's bookstores, seminars, and classrooms - to include those principles embraced by the titans in the field. One of the main ideas put forth in his book is that a manager must be able to treat his organization/department as if it were his own company. While not a new idea, Michael does take it a bit further insisting that it is an absolute requirement that each person's role in the organization must fill his own personal vision. When this is the case, the manager can find true fulfillment in his work and achieve wonderful things in the process. If not, all the theory, training, etc are pure folly. There's lots of good stuff in this one. It's an easy read too. Michael unveils the e-myth philosophy and how it can be implemented by walking through the process with a manager of his own company.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper"
3,Wife of an Entrepreneur,"First of all, the E stands for Entrepreneur, not anything to do with E-commerce. I bought this book and the ""E-Myth Revisited"" to better understand my husband and his approach to business. He took the ""E-Myth Manager"" on a business trip, and immediately ordered a copy for each of his managers. The tools and concepts in this book will be the topic for his next management retreat. What did I get out of the book? A much better understanding of how to work and live with an Entrepreneur."
2,"Ok, but wouldn't buy it again or recommend it",We were actually looking for something quick and easy to help us identify tree bark in the woods. This book seems to be pretty accurate if you go through all of the steps. It's just a pain in the butt!
2,Arguments and Fights: Referee Required,"I purchased this item based on reviews and the rewards that it has won expecting it to be a family hit. What a disapointment! Obviously I am in the minority for not enjoying this game but it has caused more fights and arguments between my kids than it is worth. My family (kids age 9, 7 and 6) plays a lot of board games so it's not like we don't play well together. But this game requires everyone to flip their card over the same way, yell the correct phrase (Stop Thief, Double Decker, or Sandwich) and slap at the right time. It definetly requires a referee, which is not what I want to be doing during family fun time. I've heard more ""that's not fair"" or ""he looked"" complaints while playing this and it's just not worth it. I must be missing something because so many people love it and rave about the laughter it creates. Not in this house!"
4,Slamwich is a HIT at our house!!!,"My kids LOVE this game!! They are ages 6 and 11, and I haven't won a game against them yet! It's a lot of fun, fast paced, and the slapping action keeps you hooked. We have to get on my son's case for peeking at his cards as he flips them onto the pile, but other than that it's a problem-free game. Fun, fun, fun where other card games are normally boring, boring, boring."
1,Awful,I bought it for my 5 year old and he hated it. My 10 year old broke his hand when he was slaping. Never buy it! If I could a would give it an negitive.
5,Great Game,A very nice game and I can even play it with my 4 year old twins. It helps them to recognize patterns as well. It was our first game from this manufacturer. Nice quality. We even decided to try another game from them.
5,My kids love it!,"My kids, ages 5 and 9, both have a blast playing the game. We use the advanced rules for the older child. In very short order, the kids start winning. We even find people like to be spectators when you are playing. I also like the durable well-sized box the cards come in, making it easy for the kids to put away when finished playing. It's right-sized for taking along on a vacation, but probably not to play in the car."
5,Love it!!,"I played Slamwich with my children and it is one of the few that I didn't get sick of. Years later, I am playing it as a teacher with my Kindergartners. It really is valuable for teaching kids to PAY ATTENTION and for hand-eye coordination, as well as turn-taking. When they get a pile of cards it is so rewarding, yet the others don't feel like ""losers"". And who wouldn't love a bacon-egg-peanut butter-jelly-onion-pickle sandwich anyway?"
4,Fun family game,"Even though this is marketed to younger kids, my 13-y-o daughter and her friends have great fun with it. Came in a cute little sandwich box.Not so great for car trips unless you have a level table surface."
1,Self-aggrandising pulp,"I really can't add much more to what was intelligently said by the 2 or 3 people who have already reviewed this book and actually care about history and equal rights serioulsy. Basically, this book is just a slanderous attack on Mr Irving, and has no real substance to write about. If you are interested in this subject, there are far better-written books to spend your money on instead."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!,"The trial transcripts are available on line (for free, which should really appeal to the target audience of this drivel). Read the transcripts and draw your own conclusions instead of being steered by this poorly written rubbish."
3,"Not the best thing in the world, but ok.","In this book, Evans describes the famous Holocaust denier David Irving, and he recalls all of the points trying disclaim Irving's points that the things we have been programed to believe about the Holocaust is not true. A lot of points Irving brings up are very creditable, and cannot be disproven. I don't neccessarily agree with Evans in writing about the first part of the book, because to me this was really hard to read because it bored the hell out of me, but towards the end where he describes the trial's ending is when it gets interesting. I would rather research all of this information on the internet, but for Historians, this is a book worth reading. It really shows how you cannot believe the History that people tell you, you should find out for yourself and judge your own History because technically none of us really knows what happened in certain times in History because we were not there, so listening to somebody lecture is not the way."
1,Havent Rcvd warranty,I have yet to receive warranty. My boyfriend purchased the same camera and same warranty and he received his fine. So I guess its hit or miss.
4,haven't had to use it yet (6 mo after purchase),For the electronics I purchased (a TI calculator) I should not have gotten the replacement plan. TI products have a reliable history of being... reliable. This plan would have been a very good buy if I was buying something that does have a history of producing lemons. it seems a good plan - but not for my purchase.
5,Perfect for Beginners and a Great Refresher for Everyone,"Nobody dances like Sadie. And her DVDs are just wonderful. This is no exception. If you want to get really really good at isolating your belly dance movements, this DVD is perfect. It really is the COMPLETE belly dance guide. I would recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or attempting to really get their isolations down solid. It's also quite the workout, but the burn is always good.If you're new to belly dance this is simply a must have DVD."
4,Not Bad At All,"I really enjoy learning how to dance with this DVD! It seems to go quickly, but since each new element is a different section, it's easy to just go back if you feel like you need more practice. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the basics of bellydancing."
2,Belly Dance BOOTCAMP,"It felt more like a mechanics class on the human body than DANCE. I am not a novice at dancing and have done many forms of social dance, so I was really expecting to have fun with this vid. Unfortunately, I felt like the majority of time was spent doing endless drills and relentless stretches...not very fun at all.If you are looking for a fun workout, this is DEFINITELY not for you. However, if you have your heart set on learning perfect and rigid technique for belly dancing, this could be your thing. There is no denying that Sadie is the reigning queen of bellydance, but I just found this vid too daunting to be very much fun.PROS: (1) Great Attention to Detail in Physical Technique (2) Great attention to flexibility and proper postureCONS: (1) Not exciting or engaging (2) DRILLS, DRILLS, and more DRILLS (3) Can become quickly discouraging, as each drill rapidly builds on the next"
4,Great Look at a Great Band,"This is a great DVD. Despite the fact that it is short, it gives a great look at the band behind the scenes, without the makeup. The guys are all pretty funny (well, maybe not Gurgg, but the other 3 are all lively with great personalities). This is a must have for fans of the band."
4,Very Good ! ! !,"I love Mu Dv Ay Ne. Ever since I heard ""Dig"" I have loved them. But this DVD is not all that I expected. The music video for ""Dig"" (which all in all wasn't that great), multiple angles for the video, and some great behind the scenes footage. Other than that, there is nothing else, no ""Easter Eggs"" (hidden stuff), no bonus features, nothing really else. I really enjoyed the backsage footage. It was very interesting and in some parts very amusing. But that really is not enough. The song is really great, but they could have at least put some extra stuff on here, like an unreleased song, or a remix (of which ""Dig"" has two). Or maybe even some live footage. But all in all, it is a must have for all true Mu Dv Ay Ne fans...-MC"
3,Freehand perspective and Sketching,"Very difficult to read and I'm a college grad!. Written in the early 20th century. Most of the labeling on the illustrations are 'microscopic' in size If I had found it in a bookstore where I could have looked at it prior to purchasing, it would have stayed on the shelf."
2,Not that good,"They trick you with National Lampoon's because it really not funny or even that good.Its really slow to start and it was close to being shut off in the first 15 minutes. Then it gets bearable to watch. It drags on with these guys trying to get dates from a casting call for a fake movie. Boy likes girl, ex boyfriend, they fight, they get together, etc....Plus you are watching the guy from American Pie and the guy from the Drew Carey Show thinking this is where they have fallen.To tell the truth I was expecting a raunchy comedy, like Porkeys, and it was not that at all. If its a Saturday afternoon and everyone has the flu then watch it, if not then watch cheaters or something."
1,Physics of Space Plasmas: An Introduction,"Physics of Space Plasmas: An IntroductionIt turned out to be the 1991 first edition, with lots of typos and incomplete sections. Very disappointing.Seller Information: Powell's Bookstores, Chicago"
5,A New Day Has Come!,"I was very pleased to hear that Celine Dion would release a DVD single of her music video ""A New Day Has Come"" from the album of the same title! It's nice to have Dion's music videos. Her last collection was ""ALL THE WAY...A Collection of Song & Video"" which didn't include all!The bonus features are worth the DVD itself! It includes a biography (similar to the onw on ATW), The Making of The Video, The Making of the Album, and an in-studio look of ""Have You Ever Been In Love"".Celine is at it again ans I have the feeling we will always be in awe of her! You go Celine!"
5,WOW!,"This dvd single is a must for every celine dion fans... It contains unpublished footage, as photo shootings, studio recordings, and interview, and lots of stuff!It great!"
5,Excellent!,"I loved the song A NEW DAY HAS COME and I never actually haven't seen the video for the song in full length, so when I watched the DVD it was for the first time. I loved the behind the scenes, the photo gallery and the remix of the song that was playing in on the background.It's amazing to see how long Céline has come."
4,Toilet Self-Cleaning,We are on our second 6 months of using Neverscrub Self Cleaning Toilet product and it really does work! I think the word NEVER would apply for normal bowel activity; sometimes for unusual splash the water in bowl does not go that high! Nice product! We will continue to use.Neverscrub Self Cleaning Toilet Refill
1,NeverScrub doesn't work,"I have used it for over a month now and it doesn't work at all.Yes, I have it hooked up correctly."
2,Makita carbide beam blade,"This monster of a saw blade looked great coming out of the box, but the the words ""made in China"" appeared. A fine Japanese product now produced its blade in China rather then Japan? I used it to cut SIP's stress skin panels and the old panels on my roof, which needed to be replaced. It cut thru the 4.5 inch panels and partially into 3/4 inch pine and performed well. Cleaning my tools after cutting out three panels I noticed that 13 of the 32 carbide teeth were either chipped or totally missing. I used a milwaukee carbide for the initial cut, American made, and no damage to the blade, but the Chinese made one, totalled. The blade has been sent back for a refund. In the future I will purchase a Frued Diablo blade, made in Italy. I hear they hold up well. The Chinese metal in the blade must be the same garbage they made my trucks rotors out of, 20.000 miles and they disintigrated."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"TOO MUCH MONEY. IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT THIS CHAIR TOGETHER, I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER. HOWEVER, I DID AND HAD PROBLEMS. THE PREDRILLED HOLES DID NOT MATCH UP WITH EACHOTHER AND THEN I RAN OUT OF SCREWS. I HAD TO GLUE THE SLATS ON THE SEAT AS THESE PIECES WERE ATTACHED WITH THIN ""STAPLES"" AND LIFTED RIGHT OFF. I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS CHAIR, HOWEVER, BEING IT WAS SO BIG, I DIDN'T BOTHER. HAD IT BEEN SMALLER, I WOULD HAVE SENT IT RIGHT BACK AND ASKED FOR A REFUND."
5,Live and learn,"I have a really hard feet to fit, and find it nearly impossible to get a pair of shoes on-line to fit me. Since there are no shoes like this in Anchorage, Alaska to try on. I am going to ""America"" this fall and will stop in some large shoes stores in ""big cities"" to get a pair that will fit my ""weird foot"""
1,READ THE FINE PRINT!!!,"VERY UPSET!!!!!!! We purchased a sandisk mp3 player and purchased a replacement plan from this company. I have a cover for it, and the case itself is in excellent condition. One day I noticed that when I turned it on the internal screen is cracked. I contacted the replacement plan company and I was told that the internal screen is cracked from something as simple as carrying it around it your pocket (pressure damage), and it was not covered because it fell under the category of accident or abuse. I said carrying it around in your pocket should be labeled ""normal wear and tear"" but they wouldn't budge. So I would definitely NOT recommend using this company, or make sure you read the contract first and call to see what the deinition of normal wear and tear is."
1,2 - Year Replacement Plan,Thought this would be a good investment but had problems since ordering one (1) 2-Year Plan; was invoiced for two (2) Plans ~ then received seven (7) Plan numbers.Have contacted the Plan provider and have not heard back on any progress and am now wishing I had not ordered a Plan.
1,No Peace of Mind,"I purchased the plan as most do, to protect my investment. When I received confirmation about the plan, it had no indication about what it was covering. No order number, product number, description of what was being protected, nothing. I only hope that it never comes down to me needing to use it. For all I know I bought a plan to protect my shoe laces."
2,Barely worth it.,"I spent $20 to insure a $50 item (Magic Bullet), since I read a lot of people had trouble with the Bullet. Over a year later the Bullet did break. The replacement plan phone rep was very helpful. The problem was I had to pay for my own shipping to the company ($10), so when all was set and done, I had spent $30 to get $50 back. And that was only because the item actually broke. If it hadn't I would have been $20 regardless. I guess if you think there is a really good chance the item you buy may break (like i did) it may be worth. Other wise it is probably not worth it."
1,Be weary,I had this on a GPS sent the thing in three times to get it fixed - never did get it fixed finially just gave the GPS away and bought a new one.
1,bogus offer,I bought this service plan for a refurbished Logitech mouse that has now failed. Upon requesting service I'm told the plan shouldn't have been offered for a refurbished product and my purchase expense will be refunded. So if no claim was made they'd keep the money and when a claim is made they refund. Quite the business plan.
2,this product was not used,I ordered this service plan to complete the order for the DVD player which I have since returned and receivedcredit for from Amazon. I also e-mailed the seller of this product about my return. To date I have not received either an e-mail or credit for this product.Regards.. Duane Matson
5,2 Year Replacement Plan,This sealed the deal for me. I always buy a replacement plan any time I purchase an electronic device. I may not have purchased the digital voice recorder (Olympus VN-2100PC) from Amazon if I did not have the option to purchase a protection plan.
4,Are you blind or am I on drugs? Discuss.,"Surely the film is a comedic and technical triumph. My belief is that if one views the film as a straightforward English period chiller you'll be missing the point even if gaining some enjoyment for all that. Try looking for all the visual gags of perspective, shadow, illusion and cliche and be amazed! They come thick and fast.Best viewed in 'atmospheric' conditions with or without the chemical enhancement of your choice, but even if viewed straight your mind will warp.Or I could be psychotic..."
1,Really... a MOTH?!,Least scary monster in film history - absolutely hilarious! Victorian babe morphs into a killer moth! Hammer really must have been running low on ideas that month... this woulda been perfect for MST3K!
1,This is not a good movie,"This is a very poor film by anyone's standards. In fact it is unusually poor in almost every area of assessment. ... It is a ridiculous plot, poorly paced, badly scripted with no art, no logic, poorly acted and best forgotten. It has to be seen to be believed."
4,Peter Cushing is always brilliant...,"First of all most of the viewing audience does not know who Peter Cushing was...and most of the viewing audience has been saturated with gore and blood...so i could care less if they like this movie or not...I am a Peter Cushing fan...and he makes this movie worth watching....Hammer, Amicus and Tigon film companies are long forgotten for most people and others have never heard of them...well, i have heard of them...Today unless gore is involved the average horror viewer turn up their noses at movies such as this one....too bad...again i don't care....For people who grew up with movies like this i say..""Buy this..you will like it!"".....It is a beautiful film...The Blood Beast Terror is not a brilliant film...but watch it anyway...It is fun...!!"
3,A little Lovecraft is good for you,"This is what happens when the English watch too many Roger Corman movies: a color re-make of THE WASP WOMAN. Enjoyable hocum salvaged by Peter Cushing, who couldn't give a bad performance if he wanted to. A nice color print that you would expect from European craftsmen. Now when they give THE VULTURE hell, it's director won't have to stand the abuse alone. Make room for it on the shelve."
4,Hard to find item,"These blades where ordered for an older american classic, and are hard to find, have not installed them yet, but will in the spring."
1,utterly horrible,"This poorly bound and even more poorly written text isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Despite authors from CMU ECE, the book's problems include: poor organization (table of contents shows it sparceness), insufficient diagrams (and largely unhelpful ones that provide more confusion than clarification, when unfortunately provided to the poor reader), bland formatting (black and white and sheer text make this an even duller read) and problems that both are unrelated to the examples given in the text as well as not having solutions that are clearly given made this book a horror to behold while taking CMU's 18-100 (S00, Sullivan). Unless the 18-100 prof forces you to buy this, avoid this and rate this shoddy text with negative stars."
3,Very dry reading,"I couldn't wait to read this book after it arrived. But I was disappointed. Althought the topic was fascinating, the writing was not. I became bored and at times found it hard to follow which person was doing what. I had to re-read some paragraphs to make sure I knew which person I was reading about. If the writing had been better, it would have been a far more captivating book.Falling Leaves: The Memoir of an Unwanted Chinese Daughterwas much better."
3,"nice story, too redundant","Although I enjoyed reading this book, it seemed to be redundant and unorganized. It's a really nice a compelling story. The live of Ms. Chong's grandmother is interesting and not uncommon for the time and the place. The problem is the book's structure. There are bits and pieces of the story scattered all over. If you are interested in the chinese-american (US/Canada) culture, this is a good book to read. On the other hand, if what you want is a coherent, well structured book, this book is not going to cut it. The pictures are a nice touch:)"
2,"Debby, 31-03-1998","Allthough the story in general is very good, I had to wrestle myselve throught the pages. Too many facts, names, places and dates and not written in a pleasant way. If you're interested in story's about China, I'd rather recommend the writer Amy Tan, or Lulu Wang with her beautifull new book ""Het Lelietheater"". Unfortunately only available in the Netherlands at the moment."
5,A must read,"I read this book in one sitting - could not put it down. It is a delightfully refreshing account of a young woman's journey to being an observant Jewess. It didn't glorify the path, rather illustrated the stumbling blocks and immense courage it took to take each step.I would highly recommend it. The language usage, Ramona's honesty and above all her sharing of this path is magnificent."
4,It's good and bad,The Listening device works good. The device that you look through to look far away isn't very good all I could see was a blur. I sort of reccomend it and sort of don't. If you buy it than the listening thing is what you should use.
4,Really works,"The microphone works suprisingly well, and I didn't encounter any quality problems the other reviewers commented on.In fact, this is the one toy my 8-year-old son played with the most after Christmas."
2,Overpriced for what you get,"I was not pleased this toy, which I bought for my 8 yo son. First off, I can see not including batteries, but was INCREDULOUS that they would have the gall to also require us to purchase the special tiny lightbulb for the penlight. ... Also the ""Listening device"" is not very effective. It is NOT a directional microphone so just provides marginal diffuse amplification. The toy looks slick but is disappointing to use."
3,ok.....,"When i was into spying, I wanted some stuff that would really help me. S I found this set here. And it looked awesme becase it had a listening device and a telescope and a little flashlight. So I bought it. It was kind of a dissapointment. When I put the battery in the listening device, it didn't really work good. And the battery lasted like 2 weeks. The telescope is hard t focus with. It would be really hard for kids to work. The flashlight was the only thing I liked in this set. It was bright, and it lasted about 6 months. I hope tis rewiew helped you"
4,Great fun,Purchase as a gift and it was enjoyed. Allows kids to use their imagination which doesn't hurt today.
3,"Looks cool, but is easily forgotten.","This was a present for my 10 year old son. At first, he played with it eagerly but that enthusiasm lasted only a couple of days. The penlight is rather useless as is the magnifying lens. I will say that the listening device is fun and actually amplifies noise pretty well."
4,Super spy kit,We bought this item for my eleven year old son. He has enjoyed every minute of it. The bulb in the flashlight did not last very long but other than that it has been hours of fun for him
1,"worthless, cheap junk","the positive reviews of this product were probably posted by the manufacturer. The amplifier doesn't amplify, it just distorts. The telescope/microscope does neither, its impossible to focus on anything at all. The lazer pen sort of works. I bought similar items at the dollar store. 1$ for a microscope that focused, another $ for binoculars that actually focused and 2$ for a microphone unit that distorted just like the one in the spy kit. (...) save your money"
4,this toy [stinks]!!!,this toy [stinks]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a week after i got mine one of the earphone went dead an i had 2 hold it a certain way for it to come back in an sometimes it didn come back in.the battery panel can open easily wen dropped. it is not made for children with a younger or baby sibling.DONT BUY THIS TOY IF THE KID YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR HAS A YOUNGER SIBLING.IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
5,The Real Baby-Doll Toy,This is the tightest toy ever. Only real Baby-Dolls play with this toy. If you want to be a real Baby-doll then you have to buy this toy. It is so fun to play with. Be a real Baby-Doll and get this toy.
5,The Incredible 5 Point Scale,A wonderful tool to help individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders recognize emotions within themselves and how those emotions affect their behaviour. Using this tool one can help these individuals to develop strategies to prevent inappropriate behaviors due to intense emotions.
4,Great Game!,"Toy was in great condition based onbeing slightly used before. All the pieces were there. During play, the game was educational and fun! Great Christmas present for my boyfriend who is a geography major :)"
5,"A strong collection from a good poet, translator & critic",Vitiello does this Italian poet justice and is to be commended.
5,We had tons of fun with this game!,"I bought this for my 7-year old son for Christmas. We took it to some friends house and played with kids and adults. Everyone had a great time and it was easy for the kids to learn since it is much like Bingo, but with a funny dog theme."
5,great game,I'm a counselor for children and have found that kids really take to this game. It's challenging enough to be fun. Talking about how the dogs get into trouble starts good conversations. It is short enough to play several times to give everyone more chances to win.
5,"""Wonderfully done--magnificent story!""","Although my favorite Joseph book is 'With Joseph in the University of Adversity: the Mizraim Principles' by Dr. Parks, this one and Swindoll's are right at the top! If you want a simple exposition of the wonderful story--carefully done by a highly-respected author,then you won't go wrong with Getz. If you want sound principles for everyday life that you or a graduate can use--and really well-organized--go with Parks (if you can get your hands on a copy). Dr. Getz shows his skill best in his applications of the story, and we can all learn much from his effort. These are the best three Joseph books around."
4,Class book,"It's good. Sometimes hard to understand, but I needed it for class. If you're into this kind of stuff, you'll enjoy it."
4,Preparing for GMAT,Book is in good condition. I am preparing for GMAT and my weakness is CR and RC. One of the recommendations to improve them is study this book. I read 1st chapter and reading 2nd chapter. these two chapters are excellent. I hope this book would help me to overcome my weakness in CR and RC
1,Confusing book,"The book as nothing to do with philosophy or writing. I have met the Professor who sometimes gets confused about what he has written. It is not easy, its difficult to grasp, and I am sure there are better books out there."
3,Issac Stern is great but...,"It is nice for Issac Stern to publish this CD, but I feel his talent should be better used to do large piece recording. This CD makes me feel like he has run out of money and has to play on the street for some quick spending cash. Ever heard of Joshua Bell's experiment at DC's subway station?"
4,heard taped version of book & enjoyed it; lots of good ideas,"enjoyed the taped version of the book . . . received a lot of good ideas from it, and i think you will too."
2,Please hammer don't hurt them,"You have got to be kidding me, I ordered what I thought might be a half decent porno documentary along the lines of!"" Life after porn"" boy was I disappointed. Well I'm sure there's 1 million other things that can disappoint you in life but I guess it's always more disappointing because we all know the integrity and standards of this industry in general are so high. Respectfully Johnny Irish"
4,Good shoes,These are cool shoes. Look great with jeans.Sometimes they look pink from far away. And they look a little goofy with shorts if you have big feet.
3,Interesting,Wanted more info in capabilities of P-47Like most 1st person WWII books the writing wasn't great but was OK
1,Boycott this book,"This is an OK book, but unfortunately Bentley's predatory practice of reorganizing the same information or renumbering the chapters every year or so keeps students buying the expensive paperback, selling it back for far less to bookstores which then cannot sell it. The contents of the book are indistinguishable from other editions; you don't need the newest one.If you need this book for a class, buy a used one and refuse to support Bentley's intellectual laziness."
3,More theory and disbelief than practice,"It seems the author is on a quest to document statistical models pitfalls and express his frustrations against some of the misconceptions of statistical analysis. Certainly this is the most complete statistics book I have seen in terms of mathematical proofs, but the title ""Theory and Practice"" seemed to imply a text oriented towards applications. There are a number of classic case studies presented, but statistical analysis has evolved since then and I for one knew that an imperfect tool it is, not a mean to predict the future or express causality under every circumstance.In short buy this book if you are in an academic path and want good mathematical foundations on linear regressions and probit models. You will still need assistance though because formula explanations are reduced to a bare minimum."
4,The best I've found so far...,"Pros - Stainless Steel, easy grip for little kids to hold, cleans nicelyCons - Avent adapter leaks when left on it's side, about $5 overpriced, a tad small (wish it was 2 oz bigger. My 4 yr old empties it really quickly)."
5,Wonderful,My little one loves this sippy cup and so do we. Its slightly heavy but it will build their strength in their hands and arms. Its a great option so you do not have to buy plastic.
4,"Great cup, best to get the stainless steel","I purchased a few of the Kleen Kantines & they are great. They tell you not to wash them often in the dishwasher. I wish I had more time in the day but I don't & use the dishwasher for pretty much every cleaning. So, the paint has chipped. The last ones I ordered are stainless & we won't have that issue. The sippy cup is great but my son prefer's my 4 yr old daughter's more & she has the sports cap. So, I ordered him his own sports cap one."
1,Very Frustrating!,"I was SO excited about this product and ordered two. They both leak everywhere. Also, when I pour milk into it from the refrigerator, the kanteen is so cold that my toddler can't hold it. We had to cut up a sock and put it around the kanteen, which was actually fine if that were the only issue. When I first fill it and shake it around it doesn't leak. Then when my son drinks out of it and puts it down, milk spurts out from every possible place whether I tighten or loosen the top. I also bought a stainless steel straw cup by Thermos(which claims no BPAs in the straw parts). With the straw cup you know it will leak if it tips over, but at least it is totally leak proof if the top is closed."
1,Leaks like crazy!,"The Klean Kanteen might be an sufficient water bottle, but should NOT be considered a ""sippy cup""' by any means! I bought the bottle w/ the Advant adaptor spouts and had milk leak all over my house, furniture, carpet, and children's clothing! The adaptor leaks (where it meets the spout), and plus you cannot fill the cup past the half way full mark or it leaks out of the neck of the bottle. What a nightmare! I appreciate the attempt to make a non plastic sippy cup, but I thought the term ""sippy cup"" meant ""no leaking"". As far as this product goes I would wait until the kids need an actual ""water bottle"" and then buy it."
1,messy...,"We bought 6 of these cups to get away from the leaching problems with the plastic cups. While these cups are ok with the sports cap or any of the other lids, they are horrible as a sippy cup. Milk leaks from the vent hole in fairly large quantities, which makes them useless as a sippy cup."
1,Leaky Mess,This sippy cup leaks everywhere. The Aventi spout has a little air hole that allows all types of liquids to leak out and get all over the place. It's unfortunate that this expensive sippy cup doesn't compare with less expensive brands.
1,can't use other types of caps,i was under the impression that i could use a spout with it as well but it doesn't seem to work. very annoying since the life of this very expensive bottle will be very short!
2,leaks,I am giving this item 2 stars because it leaks everywhere...I would give it one star but considering I haven't been able to find any stainless sippy cups that don't leak I will at least give it 2 stars because my child does like it.
4,Like sustainability & customer service,"Just wanted to note how amazing their customer service is. My daughter recently got this Kleen Kanteen sippy cup and after numerous droppings she finally broke the black gasket (the black part you see in the picture above). I called Kleen Kanteen at (800) 767-3173 to ask if they recommend a way to fix it and she just said, ""Give me your name and address and I'll mail you a new one"". Just like that. Very impressive!"
2,"Great idea, but leaks","I have tried BornFree, Sigg, and Klean Kanteen. Klean Kanteen tastes the worst, and leaks everywhere. I've resorted to using it only for water, and still, my daughter is soaked regularly with this sippy. I understand that the problem is with the Avent valve system and not the cup itself, but for a toddler, this cup is unfortunately not the answer. Please note: it's not that she's dumping it upside down or banging it around; it simply leaks when she drinks out of it, and runs down the side."
4,Safe clean product,My two year old loves it. It does get cold to the touch with cold liquids. I bought it because it is safe and I don't have to worry about the cheap plastic sippy cups leaching chemicals.
1,Broke after a Handful of Uses,"After my 12 mo old son used this sippy maybe three times (which I initially though was a great alternative to full-on plastic sippy cups), he dropped it from his booster seat (not even the height of a high chair), the cap cracked and now this product is of no use. I have contacted the seller to inquire about a replacement but needless to say after all the great reviews I've heard coupled with the money I paid, I expected this sippy would be able to withstand the expected use of an up and coming toddler. I also have a sigg ""sippy"" and find it MUCH MORE DURABLE than the KK. UPDATE: I did get a free replacement from KedziEco Bargains (Awesome customer service!) and hope maybe my last cap was a fluke?!"
5,Best Available,"I've tried a few and this one is the best. The Sigg are not steal and can leach, the Foogo have a lot of plastic. The Kleen Kanteen seems to be the best, plus it fits Avent sippy ends, which means you can boil and replace them regularly.The are also drop proof, which, you know, is a plus"
5,Great cup!,Love the cup! Purchased for my 6 month old to practice with and he loves it so far. It is easy to clean and I love that I can switch out the tops with other Avent nipples if need be.
2,It leaks because there is an extra air vent,"I like everything about it, but it has the advent sipper that leaks a spoon ful of liquid after each sip"
3,not dishwasher safe:(,"I ordered two Klean Kanteen sippies, one stainless and one orange. I've returned the orange sippy because it's not dishwasher safe like the stainless ones. If it can't go in the dishwasher it has no place in my house."
2,Why doesn't anyone else have this problem???,"I love this cup and I would love if my son would drink out of it but there are 2 major, non-fixable problems:1~ Even tap water makes the cup absolutely freezing to hold so my son wants nothing to do with holding it. I even hand-made a ""sleeve"" to put on it and it still wasn't good enough =(2~ He has to suck quite hard to get anything out (which we all know can cause ear infections) and he doesn't like doing that either.I wish they made some sort of handles or sleeve and then maybe it would be ok, but for now they are just sitting there taking up space."
5,Better than the rest,I bought the Thermos Foogo and the Kleen Kanteen at the same time.The Foogo leaks and is difficult to put together. The Kleen Kanteen is worlds better because I can use my Avent lids with it. I use my bottle nipples with it for the baby and the sippy tops for the toddler.Only drawback: Their hands get a little chilly when they are drinking cold drinks.
1,Hasbro Has Messed Up This Game,"I purchased this game for my son this Xmas, and was very disappointed that Hasbro has re-numbered,/re-ranked the pieces (the highest ranking player is now a 10 vs. the classic version where the Field Marshall was #1). Hasbro has also cheapened the game by making you put decals on all the pieces. Very disappointing that they unecessarily have mucked up a great game."
2,Better-Constructed Version Is Available,"I nearly bought this until I read that it involves cardboard and stickers. That's shameful.Search Amazon's partners and other major booksellers for the ""Nostalgia"" edition of Stratego. It runs $4 or $5 more. It has plastic pieces with metallic paint.This game is a blast; you and your kids are going to play it a lot."
1,Older is better,The older virsion of this game is by far more fun. MB should offer the older version or do away with the new version all together.Some good things can't be improved upon.....stratego is one of them.I hope this is helpful.
2,Not what I expected,I thought I was getting the original Stratego not one with wizards and dragons. same concept though.
1,Bring your pillow,"This game is (in my opinion) the most boring game I have ever played. This is not strategy, it is luck. I was literally bored to sleep playing this game! I will stick to something that actually causes you to use brain power instead of the ability to move your arm while sleeping! Glad a friend brought this over and I didn't waste money on it. Even my 10 yr old son thought it was boring. We will stick to RISK!"
4,Great game,"I grew up playing this game and I loved it! Now my son is enjoying it as well. It makes them think and learn how to strategize and is also fun, especailly for kids into the military and all that or into history. I like the updated version of the game pieces. The board was split on one side to make it fold into quarters to fit in the box...we'll see how long that lasts. Overall, great buy."
5,Excellent game,"This game is fun, requires a good amount of patience and strategy, and, at least to me, is easily comparable to chess. It never really gets old, as the game almost never starts out the same, and everything is open to the management of the player, from setup to attacks. Some players may be put off by the fact that you can't see the rank of your opponents' pieces, but that rule is, like any other, one that can be accepted. 12 dollars is an absolute steal for this game. Highly recommended."
4,Fun but not in a foreign language,"The board game came very speedily and in excellent condition; however, the instructions were in Spanish, just like Buzz Lightyear's predicament in Toy Story 3 -- how timely. A quick search on-line netted us the instructions, and off my husband and daughter were to strategize against one another. The simplicity of this game from a pieces and parts standpoint, plus the fact it provides wonderful one-on-one fellowship between two people face to face, adding in a little chess expertise and much conversation, it is a perfect game for older children to reconnect with their parents and wives and husbands to have a relaxing at-home date for the evening. My husband loved this game as a child and still does today."
5,Great game for all ages!!!!,"This game gets all of the fun and world conquest feeling as ""Risk"" but it adds a strategic aspect and isn't all luck. This game is easy for all ages to learn. END"
4,"Great game, bad new sell...","I absolutely LOVE this game and bought it assuming that it was the same as what my parents had. While the game and board themselves are exact, the pieces not only have sticker pictures (not imprinted), but you have to stick them on YOURSELF!!! It's not hard of course, but stupid, because one just doesn't think you actually have to put it together. Nor was that mentioned in the selling points. So while the game itself is the same great Stratego, look for an old copy, because it's much more worth while!"
5,Maureen McGovern is the best!,Maureen McGovern is a vocalist extraordinaire. This Christmas cd is hard to find now and should be reissued! Her vocal virtuosity and interpretations are second to none and this collection of well-known and less heard Christmas selections is always part of my Christmas listening! It was great to meet her at her performance at the Oak Room in NYC some years ago and she is just simply a nice lady. Discovering that is the icing on the cake!
5,Fantastic- I've loved it since 1990 & listen to it Nov - Dec,"I originally stumbled over this album in the music story and bought it on a cassette. It was produced by CBS in 1990 - (FMT 45869). Everyone that hears it, loves it. This album really shows off her voice, with crystal clear tones and perfect pitch. I regret that I never bought it as a CD.I especially enjoy the ""Some Children See Him"". It is a beautiful song that is not heard very often.The album provides a good mixture of the traditional songs as well as upbeat songs with some humor.After listening to everyone else in the world who ever thought of recording a Christmas song, it is a true pleasure to listen to this album over and over. I believe that it could be considered a Christmas classic right along side with Streisand and Mathis, if it got the right exposure.Why hasn't someone thought of making a television special with Maureen Mcgovern and the music from this album?If you can find this album on the music shelf, buy it quick!"
2,not too sturdy,this is my 2nd time buying the tips. they just break too easily. other than that they work just fine
5,It works,What can I say? It's a tip for a computer charger. It works fine. It was shipped very fast.
2,"Great print quality, but a significant problem for casual users","The PictureMate is fast and prints great quality 4x6 photos. It's a great printer, IF you print photos frequently or many at a time.The problem with the PictureMate is that its nozzles clog unless the unit is used frequently. I sometimes go weeks without printing any photos, and when I try to use the PictureMate, the nozzles are clogged. It can take quite a few attempts to clean them, and in many cases I get an error message indicating that the cartridge needs to be replaced. And it's not just me--this is a frequent problem for PictureMate users (as I discovered when I started ""googling"" my error messages).I'm having much better results with a Canon Selphy dye-sublimation printer, but will wait a while before posting my review."
1,toy printer,"The Epson picture mate does a good job of printing anything 4 x 6. It is the only size it prints no matter what the size of your image. If you seriously want to print photos, this is not the printer for you. If you want to play with some photos, this will work."
2,Cartridges don't last,"I am happy with this printer as long as the cartridge is new...I'm only getting about 40 good pictures from each cartridge. I have completed all the maintenance, but I cannot use the pictures that are printing. I'm considering a new printer purchase - and it won't be an Epson!"
5,Better than the photo lab,"I've had this printer for almost a year, printed a little over 100 photos. I'm STUNNED at the quality of this little printer. I have been a film user holdover for many years, but my wife got a new 6 megapixel camera and this printer was part of the bargain. Well, I've hung up my 35mm and purchased my own digicam. Combined with this printer, I get photos that are clearly superior to the photo lab. Dynamic range between light and dark, dark and darker, the richness and vibrancy of color, and the detail is nothing short of incredible. I have purchased several photo printers over the years and still used film. Until now. My only complaint with this printer is that the picture paper will cock very slightly when printing, so I get a small white line along part of the long edge. For my purposes, this is not a deal breaker, the prints are that exceptional."
2,Save your money,"When the printer works, it prints very nice pictures, quite sharp with amazing accurate colors and saturation. However, it's an ink jet printer, with all the evils associated with ink jets. Clogged nozzles, missing lines in the print, and a very small ink supply. If you do frequent nozzle cleanings, you'll restore the print quality, but that is a waste of ink. It has a couple improvements in that the ink ostensibly doesn't fade like normal ink does, and there are six jets, so color mixing is more accurate. Furthermore, the prints are waterproof. When printing through Epson's Film Factory, the printer crops the borders of the photos, so you'll lose the edges of your pics. This may happen if you print directly from the card; I haven't checked. This cropping is really an inexcusable bug in the process. My advice is to save your money and let a store print your photos."
2,Is this counterfeit?,"The packaging is not the original packaging, the cellophane was loose, and I could hear the perfume bottle rolling around in the box. This is a christmas gift and I feel bad for giving something that looks cheap and possibly counterfeit. I thought items sold by amazonLLC were authentic. Perhaps not."
1,selling things that are listed not for re-sale,On the bottom of the perfume box it said not for re-sale. I was duked. It was a sample that I bought. By the smell of the fragrance you could tell it was very old. -Rubbing alcohol smell...
1,Never received,"I was looking forward to this CD as many of the songs contained on it were included on a Backstreet Video I own and I wanted to be able to listen to the songs on other venues. However, the company I ordered it from (Odd Banana) sent me the wrong item and then said they did not have the item to send me and would send me a refund. It's been 8 weeks now and I still haven't see the refund or heard from them.If this company I ordered from did not have the item, why did they advertise it and e-mail me that it had been sent! I normaly do not order via the internet because of security concerns and this just makes me more concerned to do business via the internet."
5,Decent quality,Does what it is supposed to do. Very handy tool.I use it on a regular basis and it has not let me down yet.
5,I do not know how I did without,having been doing electronics for some time and only using a regular wire cutters before i do not know how I did without these. When working on larger projects these work great. Even nicer it was a freebe when I bought my Hakko Iron.
3,"Good brand, bad product","Either poor quality, or poor packaging. It arrived in a baggie placed under a heavy box of clamps that I also ordered. The blades only touch at the tip of the shears. They also aren't exactly flush at the flat side. They seem that they could be usable, but not precise."
1,"Fushicho Trading Co, what a sham.","How disappointing to expect a NEW item with glowing reviews to receive something that is so clearly used with nicks and dings to the hardened steel tip and cutting edge, cuts to rubber grip and otherwise look complete used and abused. Item even came in a zip bag with a sticker marked new. Shameless! Can't help but wonder why Amazon says item is sold by B&D Enterprises while my shipping receipt says sold by Fushicho Trading Co. Item is just within that price range of being ""not worth the hassle to return"", and no exchange since it's only ""fulfilled by Amazon"". Small item sure, but important to my work and this kind of experience makes you think twice about fulfillment services and even Amazon, too, especially since Amazon seems to have accumulated more and more reviews about fake items to used items now being sold on Amazon as new and authentic."
5,Nice,Nice quality cutters at a good price. Not much to say about these. They do what they are suppose to.
5,Cutting edge,"What can I say? These are some handy little cutters. Snip through capacitor and resistor leads like butter. These came free with my Hakko FX-888 soldering station, but they are definitely worth buying on their own."
4,second coming,"well i must say that i was rather eager to review this cd. A whole generation has gone by since Joyce has made an album and oh how i have missed her. She has made a formidable return and as she states in the first song that she: ""has been through some changes"". I found the first seven songs flawless esp. I praise his name ,what the world needs now,and a new begining. the updated all in all is great however jeers to the horrible flute ridden trip-hop version of ""come ito my life"". One more note, if you get the import cd you will be blessed with 2 bonus cuts:save the children,and what the world needs now(jsp mix).Welcome back joyce and keep cranking out the great music! 4 1/2 stars."
5,Worked for me,"I have had irritable bowel syndrome for years. It seems to have no cure with conventional medicine, so I bought Alternative Cures. The book recommended peppermint tea, which I found in the health food section of my local grocery store. I bought some and tried it, and my problems are greatly relieved! Sure was worth the cost of the book!"
4,Alternative Cures: The Most Effective Natural Cures,I used this book for advise on how to get pain free from arthritis w/out taking prescription anti-inflamatoids. The advise they gave worked great!!
3,Moderately good overview,"But not compehensive enough. If you use only this book, you will be in trouble. It is somewhat useful as a starting point, but you owe it to yourself to do further research on the cures mentioned in the book before commiting to any of them. Some of the problems listed in the book are of a very serious nature, nobody in their right mind would use this book as their sole source of informtion. Other problems are less severe and for those people this book would confirm a cure they may have heard of. But there really isn't enough to go on- this book is a secondary or tertiary source of reference and only somewhat handy. I am not strongly recommending this one."
5,Great resource. The latest in safe non drug approaches.,Bill Gottlieb is a consumate researcher. A former Rodale Exec with decades of experience and health wisdom. Millions of people will read this book and many will discover life enhancing and life saving information. ...
1,Get Candyland instead,"Don't be fooled by the cover of this game. This is the most boring game for adults to play with your kids. I have four children and Chutes and Ladder is a long game and often give up to do something else. It's infuriating when you hope to finish soon only to slide back down quite frequently. By far, I prefer to play Candyland."
2,takes too long,"I don't know if the board has changed, but as a parent of a 4 year old, I hate playing this. The board is like a big grid and my son gets confused as to which way he's headed. The spaces have numbers on them, but even I have to look at which row I'm in and when he turns a corner he thinks he's supposed to go up. I do like that the slides and ladders have pictures of rewards or punishments. We have more fun talking about the pictures than moving our pieces. My last complaint is how long it takes to finish a game. I feel guilty not playing it more often, but we just don't enjoy it."
5,Chutes and Ladders promotes kindness to cats!,"Last night I had the fun of rediscovering this old favorite, redesigned since I played it in the early 80s, I found it to be as much fun as ever. However, I would have liked to see more children to pick from, four is far too few.Great positive messages of being kind to cats! I lost all three games I played, but was outranked by superior minds (hee hee)."
3,Not for 3 yr olds,I really don't think this game is for 3 yr olds. Mine has a hard time with the idea of counting and has a hard time with the rules. We just let him play the way he wants. This is a game for kids a little bit older or ones that can count.
2,The Newer Version Stinks!,"As other reviewers have said, this version of the game is very poorly designed. It's flaws make me curse this game every time my children ask me to play---if I could only find a simple gameboard from when I was a kid, we'd be fine. The game pieces are actually larger than the squares they travel on, which is very frustrating. The board is cluttered with unnecessarily large graphics, which make it very difficult for young players to see where they need to move. The slides and ladders overlap each other in several places, and obscure the numbered spaces, so often children cannot tell which way on the board to move. Skip this game, and save your sanity!"
2,poor design,The game board for this version of Chutes and Ladders is so busy and cluttered with graphics that it's hard to follow - even for an adult - much less a 3 year old. The direction of play is hard to figure out and all of the little pictures are unnecessary. My advice is to take all kid pics out and clean up the board. Remember this is for TINY KIDS - they are just learning the basics of playing board games. It needs to be clean and easy above all for this age!
4,Chutes and Ladders,I got this game for a toddler who turned three on Dec. 27 ... it was a Christmas gift. The game is too long for him at this time but he is MOST interested in the spinner and the numbers. I think it will be only a matter of weeks before he can sit through the entire game.
2,so so,"The cardboard spinner broke after a few plays, so we had to improvise and use a paper clip. I guess it teaches kids to count, but my kids lost interest in it pretty fast. all they want to do is argue over who gets which character. the gameplay is simple but maybe a little too simple."
2,Sadness crosses Mr.Happy,"To begin the packaging/shipping was perfect. There was no damage and was deliver on time. The game itself as you can see from the picture is not like the original. This to me was no big deal at first until we started playing the game with our 3 year old daughter. The board is riddled with confusion constantly guessing which direction you need to be going do to the lack of indication. The player pieces are extremely large thus causing trouble for players to share a space. If 3 land on the same spot, forget it just put the others in the middle of the board or suffer frustration. The spinner works well enough to get the job done and there really isn't much more to say about this product other than make every effort to find the older version or at least a different one from this. :D Hope this helped!"
3,Oops knocked over again!,"This is not the Chutes & Ladders I remember playing as a child in the 60's. The redesigned version is hard to follow for 3-4 year olds who don't recognize written numbers up to 100 and have a hard time following the arrows for which way to go. So do mom and dad! A path rather than a grid would be much easier. The main problem is the moving pieces...they keep on moving every time the board is slightly bumped - which happens all the time with children. In other words, they tip over WAY too often, thus losing your place on the board. The designers need to do some major changes. It still is a good game for teaching children that sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and for counting how many spaces to move."
4,GOOD CLEAN FUN,"I remember this game when I was a kid. Now my daughter is 4 yrs. old and wants to learn to play the game. I think there is a lot of educational value to the game; there's poetential to teach a child number recognition and maybe even simple adding if they are older. My only gripe is, I wish that the spinner and playing pieces were sturdier than just cardboard. Candy Land had the right idea when they made the playing pieces out of plastic."
3,Disappointed,"The board is so decorated, that it's hard to tell sometimes which direction the piece is supposed to move in. All my kids had problems at the end of a row knowing which direction to go next. The figures that come with it are difficult to handle -- they do not want to stand up. A shorter, one-piece, figure made of plastic, or, dare I say it, wood or metal, that's not so top-heavy would be less frustrating. I also wish the spinner was sturdier. Ours warped after drink got spilled on it, & it catches on one side now unless held down firmly -- difficult for little hands to do without interfering with the spin. This is not a toy the kids get out themselves to play. They only play it if an adult suggests it, & is willing to play also."
3,Could've gotten it cheaper elsewshere,"My kids loved this game, so I bought it for our grandson, but I didn't realize I could've gotten it cheaper at Walmart."
2,Annoying Set Up,"I don't understand why, but this game has changed since I was a kid. The concept and game play is the same, but the board is terribly laid out. My young children cannot figure out which direction to go, and frankly, I have to look very carefully in order to help her. The game takes a long time to play, and often we get confused about direction and such, because the board is so busy and cluttered. I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp. I wish it was easier to play, like the version I remember from my own childhood."
4,Little kids favorite!,"As a kid my younger brother and I loved to play this game! It was a game we could play even though my little brother couldn't read, and it taught us values that we try to live up to to this day! HEE HEE!"
2,"Confusing game, not a favorite","I know this is a ""classic"" but in this version my almost 5 year old son (and myself actually) have trouble following the track. You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again. The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously cannot follow the higher numbers. So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way. It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.The ""water color"" pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be.Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one."
2,Games Should Be Fun,"Games should be fun, but this one just is not. Not for me (no biggie), and not for my 4-yr-old. The numbers are difficult to read, the path is hard to follow, the graphics are too big and the colors are not great. My son can play Candyland and Cooties game after game after game, but he often wants to stop before completing even one, long, tedious round. Too bad - the older versions were more fun!"
3,Classic game but save some money...,"I ordered this game online during the holidays as I wanted to avoid the crowds in the stores. Next time, I will go to the store to buy this as I would have saved 5 dollars! Overall a classic game where beginning number counting/recognistion skills are taught in a fun way."
5,Excellent game for youngsters. You cannot go wrong.,"This is a long time favorite game. It's not an electronic gadget or video game. Board and dice, but it's extremely simple, exicting, and just a lot fun. You'll all definitely have fun with this game."
4,My son and I played this constantly...,"My son got this game for Christmas last year and we played it over and over! I expected him to be more stressed about sliding down the chutes but it was a really good experience for him to learn about ""chance and luck"". He learned that sometimes you get lucky and get to climb a ladder and sometimes you are unlucky and have to slide down the chute. I think it was a valuable lesson for him to learn and am glad we played it so much. He is a much better sport now when we play games!"
2,This toy is visually confusing and very annoying to play,"I bought this for my son as a first game, and I've played it with him, as well as his younger sister, who is now 4 years old. I cringe every time they want to play this game. The board is so busy looking, and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by. It's confusing to kids about which way they're to go on the board (first they go left, then they go up, then they go right, etc.) I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides, et al, tell them which direction to go, etc. This is not one of the best counting games out there. Try Hi Ho Cherry-O. MUCH better game!"
5,Good ol' fashioned fun!,Standard kid's roll/move kid's game with fun pictures. Can start kids roleplaying as they progress up the ladders and try to avoid the perilous chutes.
3,"At $5.00 it's OKAY, a little flimsy, confusing game board","Its chutes and ladders, it should be simple fun. You spin the spinner move your spaces, hit a ladder, go up, hit a chute, come down. There are a lot of fun pictures on the game board, however, it makes it hard to see the numbers, or the directional arrows.As this game is supposed to be for the super young this becomes a big frustration. The standee pieces are cardboard which is fine but after playing a few games the bottoms or our characters are fraying.They made it cheap to be affordable, so you get what you pay for here."
4,Chutes and Ladders,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter. She really enjoys it. I had the same game as a child and had hours of fun with it. I think it is a good game for little ones to learn to take turns, learn consequences and be a good sport."
1,This game isn't fun. Buy it if you don't want to have fun.,"I've played chutes and ladders at various ages in my life, from preschool all the way to adulthood, and the one thing that always stood out to me was how not fun this game was. Even as a four-year-old I didn't understand why other kids liked this game; I only played it because they wanted to. As an adult, I refuse to play this game with my four-year-old. We stick with checkers; it is less boring and better for her brain.I don't know why this game has stuck around for so long and become a ""classic"". Buy this for your kids if you don't want them to have fun."
4,Fun game but child didn't like the chutes part,"This is a nice game to learn counting but whenever my son lands on a chute and slides down, he gets upset. He doesn't like the naughty part where he has to slide down but he likes the part where he lands on the ladder and do a good deed to climb up. This game kind of enforces the concepts of rewards for good deeds and consequences for bad deeds."
3,Security Hasp,"The hasp itself is very sturdy. The problem that I had with it was that the screws used to fasten it are on the short side, being only 1"" long. I would feel much more secure if the screws were in the 1-1/2"" to 2"" inch range."
1,???,"Can't say if this product is good. No instructions included for a klutz like me, so I returned it."
4,Vikings lamp,"The lamp was just as described. It has been durable enough though that hasn't been tested that much, works just fine and i have had no problems with it. The only thing i would say is the swith that turns it on is a little low on the cord so you have to reach for it but other than that it was a great buy."

1,Don't waste your money...because you will.,"I bought 2 of these at the same time, for a catering service. One burnt out within the first couple weeks, at a job site. I had to run to target and buy a cheap 12-cup coffee maker. It made me look unprofessional. A couple months later, the other one burnt out at another job. I had to drive 25 miles round-trip, to pick-up an older urn I had for a replacement. Again, it made me look unprofessional. DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE. YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
1,Burned out,Worked fine just up until the warranty ran out. Pot ran dry and thermostat failed to shut it down. So the heater burned out. Unreliable.
1,"Don't waste your money, UNRELIABLE!!!","We bought this coffee urn for our Church. It gets used once a week and after a few months it no longer perks. It sounds like it's perking, but by the time the ready light comes on, it still looks like stained water and the grounds are still mostly dry. The instruction booklet says to replace the rubber caps at each end of the tube in order for the unit to continue to brew properly. There are no rubber caps and no available parts on-line that I can find! Perhaps we lost the caps??? I don't know, but we can't even replace them! Don't waste your money, this coffee urn is a dud."

4,Still a great toy!,"I grew up playing operation, I liked it when I was a kid and I love playing it with my kids now! It is great for hand-eye coordination and concentration. I wish the pieces were easier to keep track of, but overall this is a fun game for everyone!"
3,Disappointing changes,"Part of the fun when I was the kids was the ""shocking"" buzzer. It has been replaced with a kinder, gentler buzzer. My kids don't the that fun and get easily frustrated cause they cant get out the body parts. It was much funner when not getting the body part out meant you got that ""shocking"" buzzer sound."
4,Operation,The game is nice until I tried to eat the pieces (I was 6 years old). Please do not give to kids under the age of 8 years old.
1,JUNK,"I played this game as a kid and loved it. But now this thing is made so cheap, the top paper isn't even glued down and we've had some parts get stuck under it, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to pick up these pieces, even if you are steady and all that, you can't get the pieces out because they are real slippery and so are the tweezers. There is nothing to grip the pieces, they are both totally smooth. This game sucks!!!!"
2,Cheaply made...,"We bought this game for our kids a year or two ago and they rarely ever play it. The pieces regularly get stuck in between the cardboard and are practically impossible to get out. I had to remove the batteries to get some of the pieces unstuck because there is no on/off switch, and the incredibly annoying buzzer goes off continually while you're trying to dig the pieces out of the cardboard.I have a lot of happy memories of playing this game as a child, but it was probably made better back then. My advice to Milton-Bradley - charge an extra dollar or two and put a little quality in your games."
1,Lousy quality,"I bought this game for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and what a huge dissappointment!!! My husband and I could hardly play. First of all, the ""funotomy parts"" are so small. The cavities are so much bigger that the parts slide all the way to the side and it's virtually impossible to remove the part. The tweezers are cheap and the nose of the tweezer is too big. With some of the parts, you cannot even grab the parts no matter how you try. What a piece of junk. It's going in the trash!!! Don't waiste your money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,Operation looks so good on the TV but dont be fooled...The first day I got it seemed so fun but the pieces soon became lost and they havce no roginality to it the game is very annoying and has no spark to it and for smaller kids very easy to lose the parts do not nuy this gam!!!!
2,Not pleased with the quality,I thought the quality of this game was pretty low. All of the pieces keep shifting quite a bit whenever the tweezers come in contact with the metal sides. It makes it a lot more difficult to remove the parts. Not what I remembered from the original Operation.
1,Operation,"Like most of the classic Milton Bradley games, this one is so cheaply made that it doesn't even work; you can't even play it. I can't believe they are willing to let this be the last generation who will buy these games. Ants in pants doesn't work, Don't Spill the Beans doesn't work, and now Operation doesn't work. The pieces (bones) get lost in between the cardboard and the metal, it doesn't beep, which is just as well since there is no way to get the bones out without touching the sides. A total waste of money."
2,THIS STINKS!!!!!!!!!,"My sister got this for Christmas, and it plain stinks. First of all, the pieces are ridiculasly small, making them hard to get out, even for the point of the game! Second the caddys for the pieces are to big! This causes the pieces to slip under the edges making them impossible to take out! But most of all, the bad thing is, THE BUZZER! It makes noise, because it is an electric motor that causes the board to viabrate. When this happens, the peices to go nuts! So, overall, this is just a waste of money, in my opinian."
1,The 1950s are over,"Is this toy fun? Only if you like hearing an annoying buzzer. Is this toy durable? The pieces get lost as they come out of the box. The fact that they are all tiny and white, very light-weight plastic means they are almost impossible to find once they hit the floor. Educational? If you want to teach your child silly names for the body organs. A modern version would include the real names, and perhaps some explanation of what they do. But this game blows, and my daughter was not entertained by it for very long."
1,Operation - Don't waste your money,"We purchased this game for our granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam. We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game. It sure isn't what it used to be. The plastic ""organs"" and ""bones"" slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the ""surgery"". They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them. Also, the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the ""operative sites"". Coupled with the loud buzz, our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt. Even though we explained that she wouldn't be. She said, ""I don't like this game."" The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed. It's really a shame that they've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing. Sadly, this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it's become junk!"
1,Operation dumb game!,"Terrible game. no one can play it, not even my husband, and he IS a surgeon. Can't get all pieces out without losing. Annoying sound too!!"
3,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!,"This scared me to death when it buzzed! DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE HEART ATTACK EASILY!!!!! WARNING!!!!!Get earplugs before playing! Horrible for children under 5! When I was 5, I cried when I played it! It buzzes way to much and is way to hard. And be very carful! The pieces get stuck under the slots. I am 10 now and I still get scared when I play it!"
2,Even The Box Cover is Scary!,"I don't think it's funny if a child is scared or otherwised offended by this game. By no means is ""fear"" a measure of a child's worth now or when they grow up. Actually, it's plain common sense to dislike a game that has such graphic detail on the box. This game should not be suggested for children under 12. Unless your one of those who enjoy blood, guts, & mayhem!"
2,This can't be the same toy I had as a kid,"Something has changed either the holes got smaller or the parts got smaller but there is no way this game was so hard to play when I was a kid. It is very difficult to get the pieces out without buzzing Sam. Maybe everybody is getting stupider and clutzier but my kids did not enjoy this game an iota and the parts will almost certainly be lost by the time they feel like playing it again. To give you an idea about the size of the parts ;they are about 1/4 to 3/8 of and inch. The basic concept of this game is great and if only they would upgrade the size and quality it could be a real winner but in its present form I would say forget it, go buy them some Tinkertoys instead."
1,If you enjoy electric shocks then this is the toy for you.,"This toy has gone down hill. I remember this being a fun toy when I was a child. I purchased this game for my son for Christmas and after using it a whopping 2 times it has just collected dust. The parts are cheap, small, and difficult to remove. If you keep them in the box w/the gameboard they can easily fall out of the ends. In addition to it being almost impossible for a child to remove the parts, you get this awful shock/vibration up your arm. Where is the fun? I just don't get it."
1,Thumbs down,I bought this game for my 6 year old son for Christmas. It was hard for him to get the tweezers in the slots without making the buzzer go off and then when the buzzer did go off.....which was a lot.....it would vibrate all the other pieces to where you couldn't see them so we had to shake the toy to get them back into sight. We were disappointed in this toy.
3,Hoping for under Christmas Tree Tomorrow!,"Please excuse my poor spelling!!I have read some reveiws on Operation, about the tiny peces geting caught, but i feel i'm going to try it out! I also hear about the buzzer, i hope its not to loud! Ive dreamed of becoming a doctor when i get older, when i play Operation,i will be comparing it with actual operations and body parts.Happy Holidays!!"
4,An Old Favorite...,"My five-year-old daughter enjoys this game as much as I did. It is great for building hand-eye coordination and improving small muscle control.They only complaint I would have is that the game is packaged in one of two boxes. The most common box is not very durable, even though we are extremely careful with our games. If you are lucky enough to get one of the sturdier boxes, you probably won't have a problem."
1,Highly frustrated and disappointed!,"If you view the photo associated with the purchase above, you think you will receive the original version of Hasbro's Operation game. This was not the case for me! I received the newer, revised version of the game with strange sounds and awful parts! I paid more for this product because I thought I would get the orignal. You could easily pay $10 or $15 for the version that I received. I am very frustrated and I will be returning this game."
1,what you see ISNT what you get,"Heads up! I ordered the more expensive ORIGINAL version of this game with real bones and body parts. I did not order the new version with cell phones and boogers. I did not receive the original version that was double the price. I received the new and cheaply revised version but was charged the more expensive price. I should have listened to one of the reviewers that it happened too but I gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt that they would represent stand up companies.....apparently not!!If anybody knows of a place to order the original operation that will actually ship it, please let me know. Thank you. Shame on you, Amazon."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL GAME!,I want a refund! What a rip-off. This is not the original game (as advertised in the picture). None of the pieces are the same. 'New & improved' piece of garbage. Shame on Amazon for false advertising. TAKE DOWN THE PICTURE!!!I WANT MY $30 BACK.
4,a topy with stayng power,"This older version of the Operation game is still lots of fun and not as goofy as the newer versions...honestly, Sponge Bob Squarepants Operation game???? Is nothing sacred!"
5,Truly Nerve Wrecking,This is the most stressful game I ever played. The whole time I was playing all I could think was please don't let that buzzer go off. This is also probably the only game that I love that I always lose. I can't really explain it but the game is just a classic. Something about that bright red nose just makes you love this game. Not to mention the taunting you can get away with when the buzzer goes off when your opponent is trying to pull out a bone.
1,cheap operation!,"I purchased ""Operation"" for my nephew, who loves challenging games,but the parts to be removed are light plastic & so cheap along with close to impossibleto maneuver. I remember the game from years ago and while themanufacturers may have cut costs, it also made itunenjoyable for a child."
3,False Avertising at it's finest.,"This product does not match the picture of the box. It is NOT the original Operation game, but the tacky, new version. Really overpriced for what it is. DO NOT BUY IT!!! It's available much cheaper just about anywhere else."
4,a clasic that's fun and educational,"I had one of these when I was a child. I still play it once in a while. I like it because it teaches children about dexterity, steadiness, a little bit of anatomy ;-), and hand-eye co-ordination. Some of the smaller pieces may prove a little frustrating to pick up at first and even more frustrating to find if they get lost."
5,This is a classic!!,"This is a classic! When I found this on amazon.com, I just had to get it for my children. It is still just as I remembered it when I was a child."
5,Still a good choice...,My children are enjoying this game as much as their parents did in the 70s - Operation is a classic that should be a part of every pre-teen's game collection.
4,Just manipulate the tweezers a bit for more grip.,"My 6 year old received the Operation game for Christmas and at first, she became very frustrated with the tweezers because she could not pick up ANY piece without being buzzed. So we adjusted them just a tad (the tweezers are flimsy and easily bendable) and now they work like a charm! So much better than before. Is easier and allows more control for a childs unsteady hand, but still difficult enough to make the game challenging....even for adults. We have played this game non stop since we ""fixed"" the tweezer issue."
5,Unexpected Journey,One of my favorite books. The visuals are unmatched and the thoroughness of her research really gives you an understanding of Varo both as an artist and a women. Will treasure it always.
5,"A ""must"" for all Redios Varo fans and art students.","A recommended pick, Janet Kaplan's Remedios Varo examines the paintings of Varo, a Spanish avant-garde painter. Black and white and a few color shots accompany a very detailed survey of the artist's life and times."
5,A excellent resource for informtion on Remedios Varo,"Janet A. Kaplan examines the exquisite works of Remedios Varo from childhood until death. Kaplan creates an intelligent discussion on Varo's pieces by thoroughly examining the influences and events in Varo's life that are directly related to her mystical canvases. Not only is Kaplan's writing eloquent, Varo's paintings, sketches, and photographs are seen continually throughout the book. I would highly recommend this book to any individual who is interested in learning more about Remedios Varo or women in the Surrealist movement."
4,Good all-around T,The shirts are pretty well made and the fit is good. They will shrink a bit as they are all cotton.
4,Liked it,"I'm a big fan of Simenon, in fact, he is the only fiction author that I read. First off the title has little to do with the story. The dog is scarcely mentioned and in fact has little to do with the story..at least how I interpret it. The story is about a man who is terminally ill and has recently been released from jail. The first half of the book focuses on his present life and the many regrets he has while the 2nd explains how he has arrived at it. The most interesting part for me WAS his previous life as I would never have guessed it.Although not his best it was still a very good reading"
5,Inspire your daughter to study math,"My eight-year-old daughter and I read this book together, and we loved it. If you are disturbed that Larry Summers of Harvard thinks women can't do math, reading about Grace Hopper will calm you down. Not only was she a math and computer genius, but she was also a high-ranking naval officer who served well past the normal retirement age. ""Grace Hopper: Computer Whiz"" should be an inspiration to both girls and boys, and this book can also inspire parents to read the recent adult biography of Grace Hopper."
3,Mixed Bag,"On the positive side the story and production values were good. I liked the ruthless efficiency of the lead character. This is how I'd expect a CIA assassin to act. The problem with the movie is the somewhat wooden acting and dialog. Still, I expect that if the director keeps making films, the next ones will be good."
2,Armchair Puzzlers,"The book has interesting cryptograms, but the letters are too close together, making it difficult to write in new letters. I became very frustrated and am ready to throw the book away."
2,could be better,"The cryptograms were both witty and held my interest. The letters were far too close together for me. Had the spacing been further apart I would have given it 5 stars. I was not able to do but a few due to that. Thank you, Robbie Poor"
4,Surprised...,"This one surprised me. It started off corny, but as I got into it I found that I really enjoyed it."
3,GOOD STUFF,"Some of the movies in this set were better than others. Forget about the plots, the stories, the background settings, they are absolutely terrible in that regard. But then the awful storylines and dialog are all just a vehicle for delivering some of the best choreographed martial arts combat scenes ever crafted. If you like excellently filmed and pefectly timed fight scenes, this set does not disappoint. Some of the fights are pure fantasy, impossible in the real world, but very entertaining to watch regardless.- Mike S."
4,Shaw Brothers Collection,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment. Another person might have a different opinion. Thats why there is freedom of choice.
2,Disappointed,"Shaw Brothers CollectionI just bough this collection set, I was so happy to watch them but I got disappointed because the language is not English. It is only in Chinese, it has subtitles, but who wants to read while your enjoying the movie.Good movies but wrong language."
4,informative for the average non-financial geniuses,An interesting account of how money is controlled - or not - by government policies through history. Easy to read and informative.
5,Great Book,It's is an excellent insiders view to our money polices. I believe all the members of Congress should read it.
1,Don't bother,Unless you want a repititious boring account of historical info of American currency DON'T buy this book. There is nothing relevent to todays problems.Buy Currency Wars.
3,Shipping,Ordered book that I really wanted to read and by the time I received it I had lost interest and still have not read it.
3,Almost Too Complicated,Milton Friedman is probably one of the greatest economists we have ever had. Money Mischief is too detailed for me making it complicated to grasp Milton's point in most area's of the book. I've found myself re-reading certain sections to get a through understanding.
1,itrms ordered,"mabe tag away hasn't had time to work, to much history and not enough of what yo do,console noy installed yet. money mischeif,tag awaw"
4,Lovin It!,"Talk about DIRTY SOUTH. This is some of the best music+lyrics that the South, especially Atlanta, has produced in a minute.This cat is keeping it real without advocating the random ""thuggery"" so many other rap artists do.Try IT you'll LIKE it!"
4,Dated but charming story continuing the 'Sue Barton' series,"Having first read the series in the seventies ( they were dated back then) I wanted to reread this series. The stories are still charming and hark back to a bygone era. Lovely to read, as the story is well written. Dialogue is dated but alive. Most children would struggle with the old fashioned ideas of nursing, detachable cuffs and collars and standing when a senior enters the room. But for those of a certain generation, they are a mere memory. This series will be a trip down memory lane."
1,Not very good.,"The very title is ment to generate fear, this book is just propaganda. If you don't believe that guns were in use in self defense just go down to the library and read the old books on the militia. I recommend that you start with the Pennsylvania archives. Series 5 Volume 4."
1,Doing my part to represent the true rating of this book,"If you read through the reviews, you will notice that after this books publication the first 15 reviews received one star by unique users. After that, 'anonymous readers' come to the rescue gushing with support and armed (oops, shouldn't use that term) with five star ratings. If that isn't the most shameless attempt by the author and/or his personally known supporters to counteract valid reviews, then I don't know what a review is. This 'review' of mine is really more an effort to get people to see that statistical rigging exists outside of the book as well as within. Don't be fooled. If you get this book and read it, do yourself (and everyone else) a favor and research each and everyone of its claims for accuracy."
1,Debunked research,"Too much of this book is bogged dow in figures that have already been debunked. I made it through the first couple of chapters and was disenchanted with how the book takes a thesis wish and uses nothing solid to prove the point. Read something by John Lott and see what true analysis of facts can reveal. I borrowed Sugarmann's book from someone who told me to keep it. ""Not worth the paper it's printed on,"" he said. True......"
1,Give Me A Break!,"Just another uneducated person skewing the facts on something he knows nothing about. Guns aren't the problem, criminals are! Why Mr. Sugarmann would want to protect criminals instead of law abiding citizens is beyond me. Don't take my word for it. Look at the crime rates in countries where guns have been completely banned. Ask any criminal what he fears most. Ask any law enforcement officer what is the best protection you can have. Ask anyone who's ever had to use a gun in self-defense.Of course the bottom line is that our constitution guarantees us the right to own weapons. The Second Amendment is the one that allows us to keep all our other rights."
1,Total Nonsense!,"This book is an outstanding example of zero intelligence writing. Handguns used by the miliyary, law enforcement, and honest citizens are lumped together with guns used by criminals. The author does not seem to understand that criminals are people who do not obey the law. His idea would result in a disarmed public at the mercy of armed criminals/"
1,Every handgun is aimed at you,"Sugarman should write of the health field where doctor's negligence allows more deaths than guns! Get out of the ""destroy the constitution arena"" and get with the program! We American males are not Palestinians. We will NOT be reduced to stone throwers!"
1,Propogandist manifesto,"Rife with distortions, inaccuracies and downright falsehoods, Sugarmann's book is nothing less than pure propoganda. From its outset, the book exposes nothing other than oft-repeated (and repeatedly debunked) assertions.This book is highly recommended for those who have already committed themselves to the false hope of gun control. But for those in search of truth and guidance, I would recommend a search elsewhere."
1,Facts? Where?,"I hate to admit it, but I finally found a book I couldn't finish. I spent quite a few years in law enforcement, and I honestly couldn't find support for Mr. Sugarmann's facts and numbers from any of my usual sources. I've never appreciated anecdotal evidence, and it does not serve anyone's interest in regard to such a serious topic. It appears that numbers have been twisted to fit an agenda. I can only advise a serious student of crime control to ignore this book as the propoganda it is. Research your own facts. I suggest the National Safety Council and the FBI. Sugarmann's assertions regarding suicide can be contradicted by any serious work on the subject. I tend to trust psychologists over Mr. Sugarmann. Only my opinion, but I'd rather have spent the money on a good dinner."
1,The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms,"The Right of the People To Keep and Bear Arms Shall NOT BE INFRINGED. Guns are arms, plan and simple, and thus may not be limited in any way, shape or form. If you dont believe this, MOVE TO COMMUNIST CHINA!"
1,Don't order,"I thought this would be a great little gift for my sister untill I found a bigger bottle. I even bought one for myself. But after taking the tiny little plug out of the bottle, all the perfume leaked out of both bottles! I didn't get to use it once even. Neither of our bottles were stored laying down so we were both very disapointed."
1,BEWARE! Not the original recordings!,"BEWARE! BEWARE! These are NOT the original recordings! All of the 21 tracks on ""No Milk Today"" are re-makes. You can tell after listening to about 3 seconds of each cut. They are not alternate takes and they are not live takes. They are all re-makes, that appear to have been done much later. Peter Noone is hardly recognizable, and I could swear that on some tracks that he is not even the lead singer.This is a major disappointment. I bought this CD because it had a nice selection of tracks and complemented my other Herman's Hermits CDs. But now it's going in the junk pile. Oh, the songs are nicely done and all, but if you want the original hit recordings, then this is NOT the CD to buy.There are no liner notes. Only track listings. There is no indication that these are not the original recordings. But they are definitely not.BEWARE! BEWARE!"
1,"Worse product, not worth the price",Sound on these speakers are the worse. I return them for a refund... Don't waste your money.
1,Awful Reference and Introduction,"I purchased this book for my client server class. I had to go out and purchase the client server for dummies to explain and illustrate client server technologies. Hard to follow and author loses you in his self-centered tirades. Do not buy this book, it's awful. Save your money and look elsewhere for your needs."
1,You might not get what you ordered.,"You will notice that the description on this page describes this item as a dual disc. Friends recommended this title to me, as supposedly the dual disc contains a nice surround mix. However, I have no way of knowing that, because the label that released this decided to drop the dual disc, release it as a plain CD, and NOT CHANGE THE ISBN NUMBER!!!!!!Would it really have been that difficult to actually create a UNIQUE ISBN NUMBER FOR A UNIQUE PRODUCT?Now how the heck am I supposed to know what I'm going to get when I order this? How many CDs am I going to have to buy to find the dual disc?So, take this as a warning, when ordering this item, there's no telling what kind of disc you will actually get."
2,loud pump,The pump is loud and would not restart after just 4 month of use. Would not recommend as a sump pump.
4,surgery on call,helpful for the intern. A good case based format of the information. Not in depth to help you beyond your first couple of years though
4,"Good classic game for little kids, but colors not so good","This classic game is a must for little kids. But this particular edition the colors are not very good - the red and the orange are very similar, which makes it a bit confusing to little kids. Otherwise it is fun first board game."
2,Ugly Graphics and Made Cheaply,"I played this as a child and loved the game. It was so much fun to look at the pictures because they were so tempting (from the 50's). Sadly the game is cheaply made and the graphics are terrible and extremely ugly. I would pay more for a well made game and would much rather have the vintage graphics than these cheesy looking pictures. Ugly, ugly, ugly!"
5,Classic Game,Every family should have this game in their cabinet if they have young children. I just wish they would make games that didn't have so many pieces too lose!
2,Empty calories,"The new graphics are absolutely hideous. The game now has none of the magic of the version I played with in the '70s. The only positive thing, I suppose, is that the new characters are so grotesque they might put kids off candy. I wish manufacturers would remember the old saw, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"""
2,You don't really HAVE to HAVE Candy Land.,"Of course, everyone had Candy Land, but when our just turned 3 yr olddaughter wanted to play, we wanted to run the other way...Boring...., and it is for her now, when after 2 weeks we purchasedmuch more challanging and interesting games. Also, it isn't made well. The game board isnot the same size as it was when we were kids, so the playing pieces are too big and overlap the spaces. The cards are notlaminated. And, after all the years this game has been around, why are there no children of color on the box/board? I hope they're not counting the brown lump of molasses."
4,Classic Fun,"Candyland has been around forever and you would be hard pressed to find someone who has not actually played it, I know I did when growing up and remember playing it with my younger sister.I now play it with my 3 year old daughter who loves it just as much. The revised game is a bit different than what I recall, but it has been awhile since I had a copy before I got this one.It may not keep attention for all youngsters, but as a general introduction to board games it is still hard to beat."
5,Still fun after all these years,"This was a childhood favorite of mine and I bought it for my son. He was three the last time we tried to play, and he had a bit of a hard time remembering what order to do things, but I think we could try it again and it would be easier now that he's a little older. This is a simple game and easy to throw in case your child is getting upset about repeatedly having to go back to the beginning!"
4,"""I like Candyland""","My 7 year old daughter says, ""It's fun and I'm really good at it so I like to play it a lot. I'm really good at board games."
2,Horribly Ugly Redesign!,"Candy Land is a classic. It's only fun for kids from the ages of about 2 1/2 to 3 1/2. Once they really learn how to play it, they'll quickly realize they are too old for it. That said, it's a great game for teaching toddlers how to follow rules, take turns, recognize colors, and the basics of winning and losing.The downside is that the new redesign is horribly gaudy. The board is so busy, no wonder kids have ADD these days. It's like a still frame from a video game. Because there is so much clutter on the board, it's hard for even adults to follow the path sometimes and pretty much impossible for a 2-year-old.Do yourself a favor and get a vintage 70's or 80's era Candy Land on ebay. It's that bad. Trust me. I would have given this game 4 stars if not for the board redesign. Instead it get's 2."
2,The original is better,I much prefer the original. I use this game for therapy and the pictures and colors are much more distinct in the original version. I am sorry I just grabbed the first one I saw.
3,good for learn,"I loved this game as a kid and I'm glad it's still around! My kids love it as well, and we bought this one for my two nieces and they were so excited! (And so were their parents) It's good for them to learn how to count."
3,Stevey doesn't play well with others,"This product is tons of fun! The only problem is some children aren't that fun. My kid, the one I bought this friend generator for, isn't responding at all. Everytime I set up a play date for Steve and his friends, he ends up forcing at least one of the losers to eat the candyland pieces. There is a limited amount of cardboard, thankfully, so these things will all end once the neighborhood toddler population has consumed the playing field. If your kid is normal, I'd buy this."
4,Candy land,I got this game for my 2.5 year old daughter. She loves playing and it is great at teaching her colors and counting. As she gets older and she understands more we will have even more fun with it. My only complaint is more because the new board is different from when I was a kid but it just seems a bit cluttered to me with all the art over the whole board with very little white space. This is just a personal preference though.
3,"Fun for small kids, but too many small pieces","If you can afford to keep re-buying this because of all the little pieces that go missing, go for it! Every little girl loves this game :)"
1,Just Isn't the Same,"This game was something I was anxious for my little cousin to experience since I had such fond memories of playing it as a child. When it was purchased however I was extremely shocked and disappointed by the changes. The gingerbread men had wider bottoms that overlap the board pieces, and the graphics were horrible. My favorite characters like Jolly and Grandma Nut were completely unrecognizable, and Plumpy was nowhere to be found. Plus there was a beaver, where'd he come from? My cousin enjoyed the game but I felt bummed. The nostalgia is just not there with this version. Why are they ruining all the great games with their ugly changes? Maybe it's just me and I focus too much on the looks of things, but the new version just didn't cut it for me.I suggest buying the retro version from Wal-Mart or an old game board online. My cousin enjoys the older version so much that we rarely use the newer designed board."
2,When was the last time you played this?,"I have fond memories of playing this game as a child, but I don't know why. Have you played it recently with your own kids? You are NEVER going to get to the end. Even the kids can't hang in there on their never ending journey to Candy Land. They grow tired of it after reaching the candycanes. By the time you get to the last stretch of road and your hopes are high, you will inevitably pull a licorice card and be sent back towards the beginning. It never fails.The pros of Candy Land are:A) If your kid is able to hang in there, he/she would be reviewing their colors and countingB) Reaching Candy Land is JOYOUS because the misery has finally endedC) It teaches patience. Be patient, be patient, be patient, and you may eventually find your little plastic person standing in Candy Land."
5,Fun Game for Kids,"I got this for my son for Christmas, just before he turned 5. He loves it! He wants to play it over and over, and it's very easy for him to understand. Also, I got this game for less than $5 when Amazon had it on sale, so I loved the price as well! I recommend this game!"
3,IT's a must have,"Though I don't like the new style of candy land, mainly because I don't like change, the kids love it. Our 4yo has been able to learn his colors from it and it helps with counting as well. It may be a little long for a 4yo though but if you help them along they will do fun. Of course all that candy really keeps them mesmerized."
4,"This game is fun,durable,and teaches kids their colors.","This is a fun game to take along on a babysitting night to entertain the kids with.Its also educational it teaches colors,and teaches them to be fair."
4,made in China,"I had looked around at various other sites and it seemed that this was a made in the US product (like the older game is), but it is made in China. Just in case you are interested in info like that. We made every effort to only get non-Chinese products this last Christmas and this one slipped in despite my efforts.Yes, the 1984 version is better in my opinion, but this game is not for me, it's for my kids. And hopefully they'll have fond memories of the new artwork just like we have fond memories of the artwork from our game.Otherwise, kids will learn the same things, colors, following directions, following a path that changes direction, matching, etc.Still a great game!"
3,Candy Land is what it is. Great starter game but quickly outgrown.,"The good of the Candyland game is that it's simple and my daughter has played since she was two. The bad part is that it doesn't teach anything other than the very basics of board games. There is absolutely no skill used. Once you shuffle the cards the game is decided. You pick cards one by one and move accordingly. The kids cannot learn any real strategy at all.If your child is over 3 or 4 and has the basic understanding of what a game is, then I'd say skip Candyland. There is little point to a game that is decided at the first card. But for the very young it's worth having around so they can learn what game boards look like, pieces, cards, and feel the joy of winning...and losing. But I'm very glad to see my daughter grow past this game. Very."
3,Unhappy with the new graphics,"The game shown in the picture is not the game you get. The graphics have been totally redone. Maybe I just don't like change, but I was very disappointed when I opened the box and set it up. Will toy manufacturers ever understand that when parents purchase a classic like this, that they themselves played as kids, they want it too look similar to what they played with as kids? Even my 9 year old was disappointed when, after sitting down to play with his 3 year old sister, he realized that there was no Peppermint Forest, no Rainbow Trail, no Gramma Nut, no Jolly or Plumpy, and the fairy princess Frostine has been replaced by Moxie Girl wannabee. The new graphics are garish and distract from the classic simplicity of the game. There is really not a bare space on the board.That said, my 3 year old enjoys it and it is helping me teach her to take turns, be a polite winner and a graceful loser."
4,Fun and educational even for a 2 year old.,"I got her this game because older kids were playing it and she wanted to be part of it. However, she didn't know how to play and would just take the pieces and run away with them. My daughter is 2 years old and when I purchased it, I taught her how to play. She is learning to count and play fairly with this game. Also, it teaches you about colors and how to take turns with other kids. Great game even for 2 year olds"
4,A Classic Childhood Game,"What can I say--this is a children's classic. My son, now almost 7, still likes this game and he is ""teaching"" his sister, only 2-1/2 to play. The problems of this game are the usual ones--lost cards, lost markers, etc. But still lots of fun and truly something enjoyable and easy for parents and kids (of any age) to do together!!!"
1,They have RUINED it.,"My husband and I remember Candy Land and were excited to play it with our 3-year-old. What a disappointment. They have ruined the game.- There is no longer any white space on the playing board. The path used to be made of large squares that wandered through a white/pastel candyland. Now, every inch of the board is covered in super-saturated graphics that make it hard to see the path, for us adults. It's like Where's Waldo but instead you are trying to find the path.- They have also made the squares smaller and put more of them on the board. Why, oh why, would they make this game LONGER? It's supposed to be a kid's first game. None of us could hang in there for the ETERNITY it took to get to the end.I am hiding this and going to look at yard sales for an older version."
2,Game has changed for the worse,"I had fond memories of playing this game growing up, so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas. After opening the game, however, I'm not so excited. They have changed the board from the classic version; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls, which I'm not happy about.. Also, after playing the game as an adult, I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance. Not super educational. I'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store."
3,Disappointed,"This board, along with our copy of Chutes and Ladders, is really difficult to play. Our son is a typical 4 year old but he has a hard time staying focused when we play this game. There is way too much stimulus from the bright pictures that fill up the entire board. The spaces are too close together and the gingerbread men don't fit. I hope I can find an older version of the game because while I love the concept of Candyland, this one is just too hard for us to play."
5,Fun First Game,I got this game for my 3 yr old and he just loves it and we play with it all the time. this is a great FIRST game.
4,Disappointment,"To be honest, I bought this game for myself, so this opinion is only for adults who played the game as a child. I was sorely disappointed by the new look of this game. The Candyland I remember and love highlighted savory artwork of cakes, candies, and goodies. The new version seems to be an attempt at creating more marketable Candyland characters at the expense of the look of the magical land itself. The anniversary edition seems to be much closer to the original look, but my memory isn't perfect, is the board artwork the same? For some reason, I only remember the food. I don't remember any of the characters."
4,Candy Land is a simple introduction to the Quest.,"I rated Candyland a low score for durability, since as a game it only maintains a child's interest for a year or two. The concepts of eluding danger, seeking a goal, making a journey and arriving safely however stick with us forever. I played Candyland as a child more than 30 years ago and can still remember being afraid of the forest, and glad my Mom was playing the game with me. A great game for any young child!"
2,older version is better,"I loved the game as a kid. My daughter was given this new version. The board is different - more pop than before; cartoony characters. I found the new board to be distracting. Otherwise, it's about the same game I remember."
3,"Just OK, but washable and made in USA.","Love that this toy is machine washable and made in the USA. My son has severe dust allergies so it was important to find a dressing doll that could be washed on hot. I like that it is a boy doll.The snap is a ittle more dificut then one would expect and the zipper nearly impossible for a toddler, but overall it is an Ok product. My two year old tries to tie his(dolls) shoes and loves pushing him in the shopping cart."
2,WEAK!!!,"Charlie can sing!!! that being said, this is not good material! almost all other recordings by Manson i've heard are superior!!!BUT, as a MANSON buff, essential recordings(THERE ARE not THAT MANY)[2 b honest the worst manson music i've heard but at least i didn't have 2 drop a dime!!!!!"
3,Danger! May not be as much fun as you remember!,"Trouble is basically the same game as Sorry! or for that matter Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders. In any of these games, the game can take an exceptionally long time if you or your pieces keep getting sent back to the beginning. In any of these games, a cheating or difficult child can make a long game feel intolerable. By the time my 4 year old hits the zone when he can play this game without cheating or otherwise driving us crazy...my 7 year old will be 8 or 9, and will she still be interested? Perhaps.Anyway, the point of this review is a warning -- if games in this category (go backwards/forwards based mostly on luck) are not working for your child yet, i.e. and the cheating or not getting it and resulting acting up is driving you nuts, dont buy this one. You might think maybe it will be better, based on your fond memories. Its not better. Its the same basic mechanic, and takes a good while to play."
4,Look For Trouble!,"Trouble is a game that has always made me think,""No I really dont want to play that..its boring.""But then once I start playing it it is so addictive and I realize it isn't boring at all but alot of fun!The strategy is similiar to that of Connect Four.As you move your markers around the circular board,your aim is to get all four ""home' in a row,as you also ""bump off"" other contestants."
4,Classic fun,I loved this game as a kid and my kids love it too. This version seems a bit flimsly and the pop up as a little hard for smaller kids to handle. The paper backing comes off easily.
1,flimsy,"I'm 33. This game is made like crap compared to what I had in the 80s. Why is it so small? I had to assemble the game myself. It's made of extremely light plastic. The bottom is even a poor excuse for cardboard. Its more like a heavy weight paper. I tried to sell it at a consignment shop, and the store didn't even want it. It ended up at the dump and I bought a vintage version off ebay."
4,Elena's Review,It is the classic game as I remember. My kids LOVE it. I did notice that the quality of the game board and the pieces has declined just like everything else. I also don't like the box - The game doesn't store well inside.
3,They sure do make them like they used to.......,"My (6 year old) daughter received this classic for Christmas and we played the game that evening. Suffice it to say, the instuctions are the same and the fun of the game is the same as when I received it as a gift MANY years ago, however the durability has gone down hill big time. I cannot believe how cheap it is now, from the cheesy cardboard used with the graphics under the board, to the cheaper feeling plastic used for the pegs. The popomatic dice keeper even feels cheap and 1/2 the time my daughter pops it, it remains on the same number on the dice. Aren't there any companies out there that take pride in their products anymore? It seems not. I can't wait to open the Connect Four game - hopefully it won't fall apart before we play it."
4,"""Trouble"" board game","This game was recommended by a friend as being a lot of fun and easy to play.It's built of high quality materials and should last a long time with constant use.I am using it as a occupational therapy aid device for a stroke victim with limited verbal communications.At first I thought the ""popper"" would be a problem but it is working out as a great exerciser for the upper body!Easy to set up, easy to follow the rules and a LOT of FUN!!"
5,Jane's Scoop,"This is a great children's board game and lots of family fun! I must confess, we ""bend"" the rules a little when only two of us are playing.....! This way we get to play ""lots"" more games!This board game helps with finger dexterity plus it a great beginner counting game. In addition, it teaches patience. I reccoment this game to parents with children 3 and above.The design of the game board itself could be improved, needs to be sturdier. The plastic bubble that holds the dice is very sturdy."
4,great for young players!,"I bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas. Based on the same strategy as ""Sorry"", this game is easier for the very young to play. The game is intended for ages 5 and up, but I bet most 4's could play and probably even 3's would enjoy it as it could be used for learning to count, number recognition and color recognition. The dice popper is hard to push sometimes, but an older player could assist hand over hand. Overall, great game for family time!"
4,Fun Game,"The game is a fun to play, but my kids (6 and 3 years old) didn't quite get it. The board quality is pretty low (just a sheet of molded plastic over a piece of cardboard), and there is no place to hold the pieces besides the flimsy box the game comes in. I don't expect the pieces to stay with the board very long, and will probably have to use a ziploc or something to keep it all together.The game itself is fun. My 3 year old could push down the popper herself with some effort, and that was her favorite part of the game. I agree with others that younger kids will get frustrated not rolling a 6 to get a piece out of home. I allowed them 2-3 pops to give them a chance to play. The game is more fun with more people, but that also increases the chance of sending someone back to start. We tried to make it fun, but the kids weren't real happy about getting sent back after so much time trying to get out.I'd recommend it to others, but would think it more fun for 7-12 years old or so."
1,Not like the original,"They sure don't make this like they used to. I played this game as a kid and remember it being much more sturdy , with a hard plastic bottom, and the popper not as flimsy. My son recieved this game as a christmas present, and most of the time the popper won't even pop the dice, and the game board it self is very flimsy. It doesn't even come in a hard sided box, just a thinly constructed jacket. Needless to say I'm very dissappointed in the quality."
5,My kids LOVE Trouble!,"What a hit this game is with my kids! We purchased it for my son, age six, and he can play endlessly. Concept is not difficult to grasp, nor are the rules. His four and a half year old brother can also play without difficulty, and they delight in sending others back to the beginning. It teaches my older son strategey, and helps the younger one with his counting. What a blast!"
4,TROUBLE TROUBLE,"Great game, good counting skills, testing patience. Overall fun. My children played trouble starting at 3 yrs old. Would recommend to anyone."
3,Is it over yet?,"I remember liking ""Trouble"" when I was a kid, now that I'm an adult, it is really boring. I played this with my kids recently, and the game started out ""fun"", but eventually started to drag on. There isn't much strategy needed, and doesn't require much thought to play. Pop bubble, move out a piece if you can, or see if you can land on your opponents piece. I started to skip good moves just to try and make the game move along faster! We eventually all decided to end the game and move on with life."
3,Not the same quality,Same fun game just really cheap quality. Thin flimsy plastic board with a paper insert for the boar colors. I suppose the real version would cost a lot more.
4,Excellent fun for learning how to take turns,My 4 and 5 - year olds love this game. Pieces fit in so when they bump it things aren't lost on the floor like other games. Both girls learning a bit better to take turns.Trouble Board Game
5,"Trouble, another classic game","Trouble is another one of those classic games. Easy to play for even young kids, just need to know how to count. Game is durable, just need to keep up with the 4 colored game pieces. My girls like to wear them on their fingers."
3,My kids don't get into Trouble.,"My two boys received this game as a gift a few days ago, and I was rather happy about that because I was thinking of buying this game for them myself.Well, it proved to be too much of a logical leap from the simple board games my young boys have played to date to this beginning level strategy game. Your milage may vary on this point, but two aspects of this game that didn't help were:First, the ""Pop-o-matic"" takes considerable force to operate. My five year old had to put his full 50lb body weight onto it just to get it to work, and it was difficult for my old son to operate too.Second, the ""have to roll a six to get to start"" rule is stupid. You just wait forever to get to even start to play. We changed the rule so you can start with either a six or a one, and that helped a little bit.Sadly, my kids lost interest after about 10 minutes. So, another unloved game in the game pile."
5,Fun Family Game,My son love playing this game. For weeks that all he want to do. It a good game for the whole family.
4,Fun times,"Not the grade of material we had years ago. But still fun, hope that the pop-it holds out with my daughter's thrust."
5,Games,"If you are looking for a good game to play I have been playing this game with my kids from age 5 The kids are 24, 20 and 16 and we still have a blast with this game"
3,Flimsy but works,"The body is clear plastic, seems flimsy but it's durable enough. The base background is just colored cardboard you need to slip in to assemble. It will suffice, although I was expecting a better quality, as they made in the past. The value is inferior for the cost."
3,"Not a strong version of good, old fashioned game","We like this game, despite my daughter's screams when she is send back again and my son's refusal to play the game for a couple of days after he has lost. It teaches essential skills of winning and losing, setbacks and gain. It's just good natured fun and at the end we all have a laugh.What we don't like is the quality: the box is thin, the 'pop-o-matic' has a small crack after 2 plays (it works fine, just doesn't look good), piece of carton with rubber feet covered with plastic as the playing board, unattractive game pieces. Can they please go back and look at how this game was made a 30 years ago when I was a child??"
4,A very good toy for the entire family,Used to play with my grandmother around 25 years back. Am very glad that it is still available and it refreshed my memories of the past. My child loves it when the entire family gathers to play around it.
3,Fun game!,"This game doesn't really have a high educational value, unless you are teaching your child how to count from 1 to 6. It's just a simple game, with simple rules, that is fun for all ages."
4,Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!,"I got this game for Christmas, and I have been playing it with my family on and off since. It's kind of hard to ""pop"" the dice, but I think that's a great idea. You hop from space to space, going around the board. But watch out or you'll get in ""Trouble""!"
2,Cheaply made,Again I am new to internet purchases. I did not review this before I bought. will not make that mistake again. The game was cheaply made. Paper backing with a warp frame.
3,Cheap re-make of my favorite childhood classic,I loved this game when I was younger and ordered it for my children. But... this game is so cheaply made now! A thin cardboard bottom has the graphics (comes seperated not integrated) and rips VERY easily. The popper is of a thin bent metal tension design that doesn't pop reliably. Very frustrating! We ended up buying a vintage game on [auction site] and love it!
5,"He is the most talented singer songwriter,he touches my soul","Richard Marx is my favorite all time singer. He has an ability to reach & touch the heart & soul of a person. His lyrics & music are well written & proformed. He is a huge asset to the music in- dustry & he should be reconized for his abilities. I wish we could see & hear more of him. I had the incredible pleasure to see him in concert several times, all of which left me for wanting more of his music. My favorite is Hold on to the Night I have devised a work out program to his Repeat Offender CD. Great for working out and Cooling down. Originally from New York I now reside in Florida, Any chance of him touring soon. Would greatly appreciate any and all information you could pass on for future tour dates, memrobilia, etc. I enjoy his dedication to his craft and respect his love of family, especially the closeness he shared with his dad. My dad is gone since 1983& he is always with me in my heart every day."
2,"Not good for learning, as the title claims","I tried this without prior knowledge of Japanese besides some very basic words, and I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. Some long phrases are hard to grasp, and they aren't repeated. Furthermore, they're spoken at native (or near-native) speed. The level of Japanese assumed for the listener is uneven, or at least grows at a rate too fast for someone actually learning Japanese. Maybe it'd be useful for someone who already knows some Japanese and wants to consolidate/review that."
4,"Great CD, but Oy Baby original is better","Fun, beautiful tunes, beautiful singing, but the songs are not as familiar as the first Oy Baby CD."
2,Disappointing quality,"Champion products tend to be better made but while inexpensive in price the ""baseball"" jersey is of disappointing quality. I bought my correct size, but the shirt was too small after only one washing and the color faded as well. Also there were several points of loose stitching that quickly became unraveled. Not recommended."
4,Champion Tagless Baseball Raglan T - Small,Shirt was good quality but did not particularly like the fit. Neck area was tight
3,baseball shirt,"I think they could describe it better by stating it weight. It is a little thin for my liking, and the neck is too wide."
5,great shirt,I surprised my boyfriend with this shirt as a gift and he loved it. Great brand and quality of a shirt. I recommend it.
3,Got what I paid for,"Size is good. No issues there. Just with the fabric used. Do not under any circumstances, get this wet. Just from opening it up after delivery, you can tell that it will go see through with rain or sweat. Fit was good for my bf and he wants more but I think I will try another brand. But for the price it will do for now."
2,Outdated Book,"This book is very outdated. The housing market had drastically changed in Spain since this book was written. Even the amounts in the book are in pesetas and not in Euros.I can not agree with the description of the Spaniards in the book, either. I have traveled to Spain many times and I think people and the whole country is much different than it is described in the book. There is too much negativity in this book. This book is written mainly for Brits. Once you finish the book you may want to say Long Live the Queen!"
2,Watch out!,"WArning! In the 5th edition, p117 (may be on different page for other editions) there is an ad for a Spanish Lawyer group by the name ofFernando Scornik Gerstein. Beware, lest you think this is a group especially there to help British/Americans, etc. They are not anymore up-to-date than other lawyers much cheaper. They are extremely expensive and will charge you for every little contact you have with them incl. emails and phone calls and even faxes! Give me a break! And any phone calls they make, you pay for the time they talk even if they are put on hold.I was given no estimate and was shocked by a 2000E bill for an NIE that I needed in 5 weeks and they could not provide in that time. Yes, I had other work done for which I received a 2p report of information that I could have researched myself. Nuff said, too big a group to give very personal service. Look elsewhere or else!"
3,Review of The Dragnet Collection,"The first thing that struck me about this one was that the original Dragnet theme song, ""The Dragnet March (Dum, de dum, dum),""was replaced by a violin every time that the original would have been played."
4,Good Material -,"The shows are interesting, especially because they're based on true stories, and short - thanks to no commercials. These original programs, however, lack Sgt. Friday's eventual partner - Bill Gannon."
2,Formula,"Sandler's plastic mode of pretend white collar/blue collar something-or-another with life/relationship issues is getting old. However, it does improve the monthly bank statement - but little else.Aniston's look cute and say dumb things all-with-naturalness roles also continue to improve her monthly bank statement but little else.The formula of relationships within and outside the office with sex as the fulcrum for humor continues and will for a very long time; also helped the studio's monthly bank statement. Oh, the formula of fake marriage w/kids has been done in many variations before - ho hum.On a positive note the writer's did come up with a few unique funny lines that salvaged the rest of the ship, as did, to some extent, Bailee's performance as well."
5,Hysterically Funny!,"This movie was definitely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time! It's well worth it! I paid to see it twice within a week, once with a friend and once with my daughter. It's that funny!"
3,Worth a watch,"When I first watched this movie I thought it was just alright, but then found myself wanting to rewatch it. Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston bounce well off of one another, as actors."
1,terrible,"fake british and german accents - over the top acting - two dimensional characters and an unbelievably bad story, being a woman jennifer aniston in a bathing suit didnt improve the movie for me, unlike it apparently did for the other 1 star reviewer. I love a chick flick as much as the next girl but this was just bad from start to finish, surprised aniston and kidman agreed to act in the film"
2,"Boring, Tried giving it a chance for Adam Sandler and Anniston but not worth it.","Don't waste your time... I'm a big Adam Sander fan and I tried watching this on an airplane ride and I fell asleep. I suggest you do the same. Or watch another movie. Funny People was way better, and felt genuine compared to this crap."
3,Average Adam Sandler fare,"If you have watched Adam Sandler films before, you know how this one goes. Guy was a loser, changed his life around and now he is rich and desirable, the envy of others. There is always some young love interest, of course. Add some peurile humor, and a ridiculous character that next to anyone would make that person look good (usually Adam Sandler is the one who looks good). . . and there you have it.I won't spoil it for you, but you know from the start how this film will end. It mixes the Adam Sandler formula with the romantic comedy formula . . . you know . . . blossoming relationship, conflict, then resolution/happily-ever-after. If you are in teh mood for cheap laughs, go ahead and rent it. If you want better theatrical fare, make another choice . . . fast!"
1,This movie was just bad....,"This movie is just bad. You would think with Jennifer Anniston and Adam Sandler it would be great! It could have been really funny, sadly it was not even mildly amusing."
1,SO FRIGGING BAD - I WANT MY MONEY BACK.,This was so trite and boring. My box of Corn Flakes is funnier than this movie and more interesting. A doctor who acts like a high school freshman is not funny. This is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. Did you know that now making fun of ugly people is funny according this writer. Bathroom humor generally is not funny and this makes that point perfectly and goes on and on with it - just to make sure you don't miss that point. It was so bad I felt sorry for Hollywood for allowing this piece of crap to be made. It should be minus 5 stars.
1,..Who pays good money to see this DREK..?,...Any woman who drags a MAN to see this garbage (And makes him pay) has issues with her relationship..And any Man who gets dragged along is a WUSS..!.The movie was a FLOP..!..Anniston & Sadler are sooooo OVER..!.BUT YOU HAVE NO STANDARDS ANYWAY..!
4,Just Watch it,"I am not the stupid comedy fan, however, this film is hilarious! Everything makes you laugh, every single scene. Aniston is stunning and fun! Brooklyn Deckler, the young, blond and gorgeous actress, acts beautifully in the girlfriend role. Also, Adam Sandler shows what he does best: being funny and witty. The kids play a very important part, such as the little girl, who forges a fake English accent and speaks like an adult.In addition, Nicole Kidman is at her FUNNIEST role ever! I LOVED her role! She is perfect for comedies! It's a complete different style for what she is used doing! Just for Nicole's acting is worth seeing this movie!Overall, it is a romantic comedy which stands out of the crowd."
2,Another waste of time,We were four adults when the movie started and after 30 minutes I was the only one who kept watching it. The perfect example of a movie that is a waste of time. Adam Sandler plays the SAME role as usual. The type of movie that you just keep checking the time to see how much time has left before it ends. Not good.
1,wow impressively bad,"I got to see this gem in theaters because my girlfriend wanted to see it. Suffice it to say it is predictable garbage that hollywood keeps ramming down our throats. As always Adam Sandler plays the same dumb role he plays in every single one of his movies. You will chuckle a couple of times but the comedy seems to be aimed at 12 year olds. The plot makes no sense at all and the ending is just magically resolved. The only saving grace is that it gives Jennifer Anniston an excuse to be in a bikini in hawaii. The only way this movie would have been watchable is if Jennifer Anniston was actually nude in it. Thanks again hollywood, I have no idea who demanded this movie, for shame..."
1,Awful!,"I'm so disappointed. I absolutely love Jennifer Aniston, and I've always enjoyed her movies, so I assumed I'd like this one, too. Alas, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Ms. Aniston's performance is OK, as is the performance of Brooklyn Decker. However, the other main actors' performances are awful. The script is horrendous. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money. Just really, really bad."
1,Terrible!,"I'm usually a fan of Adam Sandler and his Happy Gilmore productions but I saw absolutely nothing good about this movie, other than just looking at Aniston.The characters were terrible and totally unbelievable. The whole plot was ridiculous. When my girlfriend and I both decided about halfway through we couldn'tfinish it, I knew it was a clunker. We gave it another ten minutes then we had enough. That's just our opinion."
5,perfect,"DVD came in one piece an works great..no probs thus far, the movie is the best and hillarious too 4 sure"
3,Just Ok...,"Neither great or terrible. I enjoyed watching it but I agree with another reviewer that it played on a LOT of sterio type jokes for a laugh. I can say, I could have lived with out seeing this movie. It wasn't life changing nor did I laugh til my side hurt. If you want an ok Chick flick, this is it. Otherwise save your money for something else."
4,Hilarious Sunday Afternoon,"We laughed so hard, it was a complete surprise. this was a typical Adam Sandler film, with just a bit more substance thanks to a great cast. Nicole Kidman was a treat, seeing her in a completely different role. Jennifer Aniston was very funny, as was Dave Matthews. We absolutely loved Bailey Madison, the daughter. She's a great little actress and should go very far in the industry. Dont expect the best comedy of the year, just expect a great rental, no smut, no bad language and just a funny cast of characters."
1,"No charm, few laughs","This had quite a few good reviews and I thought it might be light fun. What a huge disappointment. You have to suspend disbelief about the way Adam Sandler talks with his assistant while there are patients there, about why this string of gorgeous young things would find him charming, why the complex (if predictable) scheme to pretend to have a soon-to-be-ex wife would have seemed plausible to someone who completed med school.Nicole Kidman was creepy and her character to over-the-top to buy into. The kids were very sitcom-cute. The idiot cousin was just annoying."
3,Good Classic RomCom,"The movie was good. It had a nice story, bit of a cliche, but nice nonetheless. Jennifer Aniston is in a movie that is actually watchable this time, which is great to see. This movie was better than I thought: character development, funny moments, and it's set in Hawaii (I always like Hawaii vacation based movie, brings about a good atmosphere). Of course Brooklyn Decker is there, not for her acting, but for her looks. It could have been any other pretty girls in the acting business, but for her debut, Decker actually pulled her part very well. But the pinnacle of this movie, I thought, was Nick Swardson, he is the only character that I laughed at. I think this movie would have been a disaster without him, and I thought he did a better job to enhance the movie than Decker, Sandler, and Aniston; just terrific.So I enjoyed it, and I would recommend people to rent it, and get some good laughs out of it."
3,it was ok,"It was ok. I had high expectations, because it is an Adam Sandler movie. It was ok, you can afford to not watch every scene and go back to the movie when you've been away long. Lol."
1,MOST ANNOYING! - Dont Believe good reviews,STUPID story line with the most trite and cliche scenes followed by a really annoying kid doing an english accent non stop. I had to turn it off - couldnt take any more complete mindless stupidity. Makes the Wedding Singer look like an academy award winner by comparrison.
1,Sandler + Aniston = Bad Cinema,"""Just Go With It"" combines two brain-dead genres for the price of one: the formulaic Adam Sandler shtick and the glorified Jennifer Aniston sitcom. Both stars punch the clock, go through the motions and no longer care about their paying audience. Once again, the Hollywood junk-food machine triumphs over shortchanged moviegoers - who should be watching this ""romantic comedy"" on prime time with a laugh track."
5,AWESOME,"For real, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! The characters are extremely funny and well developed throughout the movie AND... Jen Aniston looks GORGEOUS as always"
2,Waste of money,"Story line was bad. Acting wasn't great, either. Corny and stupid. I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. If you are deciding whether or not to buy it, rent it first. Then you won't waste money on the full price of the movie."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a long time.,"My husband and I tried to watch this movie last night. We made it 20 minutes into the movie and talked about how we were both unimpressed, but after a few more minutes we decided we were done. I can't remember the last time we hated a movie enough to turn it off.For one thing, this movie is about as sleazy as they come--everyone is constantly making crude remarks, but it isn't even interesting or funny. Everyone is sleeping with everyone and cheating on each other, kids are rude and out of control, and I felt embarrassed for the characters a lot.Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Almost a 'chick flick',"A litle Sandler goes a long way, but this movie is just a recycle of his hummor that bores quickly."
2,Horribly cheesy...,A few laughs and some nice bodies... that's all you get. Adam Sandler get's less entertaining with each movie he makes - this one is straight cheese.
3,Not delivered in great shape,"The DVD case was broken so that was very disappointing. However, the movie did work so got our money's worth."
3,"Funny Moments, But....","This movie had some funny scenes. However, I could not get over the fact that within 30min of the movie you know how the plot was going to develop and how the movies was going to end. Its a good romantic comedy and I do not think anyone else other than Adam Sandler could have played the role. I would recommend watching it, but do not think it is funny enough to watch it a second time."
2,"Move on, Aniston","Striko Two for Aniston: After the atrocious THE BOUNTY HUNTER, comes this mess... This movie is, basically, obnoxious. totally unplausible. Just another ""great"" concept fo uniting two star, then writing the script. Well, at least we saw Jennifer in a bathing suit.Why on Earth (other than the big dollars, of course) does she accepts only these kind of roles? She proved she can act in THE GOOD GIRL, she already proved she can do good comedy. Why be stuck in horrible comedies?"
3,Judy says;,I really love Adam Sandler movies. This was very enjoyable and funny. Not one of his best but still liked it.
2,Another Adam Sandler movie.....,"Adam Sandler in another movie, playing exactly the same character as in his other movies. Most of the acting seems like improv, resulting in the lines delivered not being funny or witty.You have to wade through 3/4 of a boring movie to arrive at an agreeable ending. Some scenes did provide good laughs, but most of the movie is just the main actors/actresses having fun with the job, not worrying about making a good movie or not."
3,A very predictable movie.,"Jennifer Aniston & Adam Sandler have great chemistry and his cousin made me laugh out loud a few times. But all together the movie wasn't anything special. It was very formulaic and VERY predictable. It wasn't the worst I've seen, but wasn't the best either."
2,Just Skip It!,"I fast forwarded through some parts of this movie, if that tells you anything! I'm very surprised that Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman would attach themselves to this movie. Not that Adam Sandler is known for Academy Award-winning movies, but this one was an even lower caliber than his other movies that I've seen. Nicole Kidman portrays a particularly annoying character. The only pluses I could mention are the scenery and the soundtrack. I repeat, just skip it!"
2,Just another meciocre by Aniston and Sandler,"Why am I not surprised this is a complete dud and not entertaining in any respect.The two stars are strictly for the Brooklyn Decker bikini scenes. Beyond that it's the same ol romantic comedy crap from Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston.Oh, and the occasional goofiness from Nick Swardson...... and Nicole Kidman played up pretty good as a bitchEdit: Sandler or someone has a love for Sting's music or a contract. All music by Sting and/or Police"
4,Surprisingly good movie,I liked Adam Sandler's early movies when I was younger but I haven't liked much of his recent stuff. I was surprised to see he wasn't so goofy in this movie which is a decent romantic comedy.
2,I was dissappointed in the movie.,"I thought the plot was too contrived. There was too much lying to cover up lies. The movie is 2 hours long. A lot of things could have been edited out. Less is more. There were a few funny moments. There was callback humor that was killed to death.I'm an Adam Sandler fan. Not even Adam can save this movie. Nick Swarzmann is funny, but not in this movie. It was painful watching Dave Matthews and Nicole Kidman's superficial, haughty characters. Not funny.Brooklyn Decker did a decent job considering she had no acting experience. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie."
1,For Simple-Minded idiots.,"This movie sucks in every way. I would give it negative 5 stars if I could. It's just an event for the actors to try to convince everyone and themselves that they are funny, hot, or whatever. It's a total self-promoting pile of vomit. It fails and it is pathetic. It's insulting that they think they made a movie worth watching. I'm not sure if many of the reviews with high ratings are a joke or not, but for those who really think it's funny are quite easily amused and have no sense of real comedy. The script is stupid and characters in this movie are stupid and so is anybody who actually likes it."
2,Let down,"Adam Sandler didn't quite do it right in this movie. He is a great actor, but the plot and lack of humor didn't work."
3,I actually liked it!,"Because of The Wedding Singer and Spanglish, I always have hope that I will enjoy an Adam Sandler movie, but I am often disappointed. So I rented this movie only because I've seen everything else out there and needed something to fill my Saturday night. I was pleasantly surprised. Jennifer Aniston and Sandler have good chemistry and made what could have been an irritating premise very enjoyable. The kids in the movie were great too and very funny. Overall, a few good laughs and a nice surprise. Also made me REALLY want to return to Hawaii."
4,Very Cute!,"Like another reviewer said, the end was pretty obvious. But I still enjoyed it very much. I think Jennifer Aniston 7 Adam sandler had a great chemistry together that I wasn't expecting. I'll admit, it dragged a bit in the middle. It was awkward to watch Adam Sandler's character create lie upon lie. But overall it was quite funny and I truly enjoyed it. :)"
4,Better then some reviewed,"This movie was great. I had low expectations because I had heard bad things about it. But honestly I laughed out loud more then a few times. Nick Swardson (spelling?) was probably the funniest part of the movie. He killed every scene he was in. And the girl that played Sandlers daughter was a riot with her accent. Overall it was a really fun and entertaining movie. In this day and age I am just looking for something to entertain me, not always looking for a movie that makes perfect sense or is a life changer or oscar nominee. Great work Adam!!!!"
2,Typical latter-day Sandler,"A generic, formulaic, latter day Sandler with all the bad connotations all that entail. This one might be ever so slightly better as I laughed a total of 2 times, something I haven't done while watching a mainstream Sandler film for a decade or so, but even of those one was unintentional. What you see is what you get, no surprises, I can admit its a damn sight better than complete trash such as Little Nicky, Zohan, Mr, Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill combined, but still not really recommended for more than background noise as you do something else and certainly nowhere near as good as the wedding singer, happy gillmore or billy Madison."
1,Rubbish,"Seriously, the movie sucked. Period. I like Sandler. He makes me laugh. The Waterboy is still a favorite of mine, just so you know where I'm coming from. No laughs here. There are a couple of scenes in the beginning of this film that are cute, but the thing nose-dives very quickly. The writing and directing are horrible. The plot makes no sense. It's not funny; it's actually very annoying, and so are almost all of the characters. And it just goes on FOREVER. I'm convinced that the 5 star reviews I've read on here are plants. They HAVE to be. No one can honestly feel that this is a good comedy."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.,"If I this were a theater I would have walked out and gotten a refund. It was predictable, dumb and the lowest common denominator of funny. poop jokes, really? And I am a fan of Jennifer. And Adam. But come on!So blondie is the one he thinks he wants but oh wait no! plain jane (yeah, right) Catherine (Jennifer) is the one he comes to realize was what?! Right there under his nose and the one her really loves. BORING. I knew it would be essentially that story anyway but I thought there might be some funny lines or cute parts. NONE. I bet they both drop this title off of their resumes like it never happened."
4,Hilarious yet Sweet Romantic Comedy!,"The stars in this movie shine brighter than I've ever seen them before and we laughed out loud, uncontrollably at times, throughout the entire movie. This movie is definitely one of Adam Sandler's best. Loved it! We watched it through Amazon's On Demand service, which provided excellent quality."
5,Very much worth the wait!,"I kept asking my friend to watch this movie with me. Week after week and every time she would say no. Well I finally conviced her because she saw nothing else and would you know it we loved it. She was asking herself why she kept saying no the movie was so good. I greatly enjoyed it, one of the few really good comedies that has made me laugh in a long time. Very happy I was finally able to see it."
3,Just gO wITIH iT,jUST Go With It was an average movie. Jennifer Aniston does a fair job. I would not watch it twice.
4,Its a RomCom,Its not some intense movie like the Age of Innocence. It is what it is...a romantic comedy. I liked it. I think Nicole Kidman did a great job as Devlin. The second half of the film was better than the first.
1,About as funny as a fart in church,"Funny? Really? This thing? I was fidgeting almost from the get-go as I struggled to get through this flat Adam Sandler-Jennifer Aniston vehicle. You do get to watch singer Dave Matthews make his acting debut and tennis player Andy Roddick has a brief cameo as the new boyfriend of the love interest, who is his wife in real life. But that's about as comedic as this gets. Too much of the cute kids acting like adults. This was almost Disney-esque in its forced sweetness. Bleecchh."
3,"You know what will happen if you saw the trailer, BUT...","...I found it surprisingly funny. It's also a typical Sandler/Dugan collaboration. Not for one minute do you buy the premise or the lengths the characters go to to keep up the subterfuge, but the audience I saw this movie with laughed. And in a comedy, that's always a great thing. So, if you're willing to suspend disbelief and put aside that you've figured out the movie's ending at minute 5, then settle in for some laughs. There's also a pair of surprises in the casting at the half way mark.I should add that a friend did not like this movie and found Aniston's character's two kids to be annoying (and everything is cartoonishly big)and did NOT recommend the movie.I did not see Catus Flower so I can't make a comparison, so those that have may have differing opinions."
1,should have -stars,"This was a stupid movie. . I am not an Adam Sandler fan but I gave this movie a shot to take another glance at his acting. Still not impressed. This was a waste of film. The little girl that play Jennifer Aniston daughter is so annoying-severly overacting. Had to mute it everytime she talked. . She must be related to Adam Sandler. Jennifer Aniston did some overacting also-sorry Jen but you were only good in ""Friends"" (give up the movies) . But then again there are more annoying actors as (vince Vaghn and will Ferrell). Just have to keep watching my old films that don't give me a headache."
3,If Only Someone Else Wrote It !!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I enjoyed it as it is as close to the real Billy as we are likely to get but really lacked the detail I was hoping. What we have here is a harrowing yet inspiring story told by someone who is clearly not a writer. When reading this, I continually felt short-changed as important life-defining moments were skimmed over. There is certainly more to Billy Connolly than this book delivers. I am hoping that someone, someday will write it. Worth the read, but don't expect too much."
4,Interesting,"Some interesting info on entertainment field in this book. Fairly quick read. Some of the info is of a sad nature, but inspiring at the same time. Loved Billy's performance in Mrs. Brown."
2,for billy fans only,"Above all else, a good biography has to make you care about the subject. This one didn't, and that is doubly sad, as it is written by Billy's wife, Pamela. His Dickensian childhood is depressing, and the convoluted cast of family members is confusing. The prose styling is competent, but the sluggish pace of the book causes it to collapse under its own weight. I wound up skimming the last half (thank you Evelyn Wood!) The cover proclaims this to be a best seller, but I assume that was in England. Unless you are a real fan of Billy Connolly, I would skip this one."
2,"Good Subject, Lousy Book","The problem is that the author is the subject's wife. It really ought to be titled, ""My husband is wonderful and we have lots of very famous friends"". The book has neither the insight or observation of a third party biography nor the intimacy of an autobiography. Recounting things that her husband has told her just makes the reader want to push the author out of the way and let Billy tell the story himself. The great shame is that Billy is undoubtedly a fascinating subject and has a great story to tell. Unfortunately, this isn't it. A opportunity squandered."
1,silly about billy,"Never has so little been made of so much. As a psychological profile of a complex man who has reached great heights depsite awful childhood abuse, the book is worthless. As a biography, it is sketchy and hardly to be taken seriously. Moreover, it is not always accurate, which is amazing given his wife being the author; for example, in the film ""The Impostors,"" Billy Connolly played a wrestler on a cruise ship not a tennis player on a train, as stated in the book. That is not even the worst of the book; most grating is the constant, very often unnecessary name dropping -- we are obviously supposed to be impressed with the list of Billy and Pamsy's friends. It's too bad, I have followed and enjoyed Billy Connolly's work since the 1970's and he is a marvellous and unique talent and would make a wonderful subject for a true biographer and someone who could write. What a waste."
5,Billy,"Gutsy story of Billy's early life , how Billy came out the other end as one of the best comedians and raconteurs of this eraPamela Stephenson has done a wonderful job describing a very complex celebrity"
5,it help me understand my pain,"not only it help me understand why im going through what i gone through at that time. at first i did'nt know about healing process if there is such a thing but there is. thank God for this book. as God was doing His beautiful,healing yet painful work in me this book encourage me, help me. plus i love how joyce would include her experience, her story it's very helpful!plus she's so real, honest not faking it. Thank you Lord"
5,Great Purchase!,This transaction was great. The book looks new. This book is great for helping woman who have been sexual abused.
5,excellent,I am through chapter 9 and it is a great book. I would recomend it for anyone that needs emoional healing. [...]
5,"We call it ""The Book"":-)","I found this book in my desk at a new job - and it was exactly what I needed at that exact time. I am Christian, and I liked that Joyce didn't try to force any particular branch of Christianity on the reader.I started passing the book around and it was referred to as ""the book"" (we didn't mean in place of the bible...) There was so much to process, from this little book. Everytime you read it, if you do, it's a completely different book. (at least for me)I recommend it. Highly."
5,Beauty for Ashes,"I had actually purchased this book for my adopted daughter who has had many problems in her life and especially in her relationships to other people, namely men. I read Joyce's book several years ago and thought the book might be good for her. Only time will tell. I thoroughly enjoyed reading her book when I did read it. It is inspirational to know how her life was and what she now has made of it. Joyce is actually a role model for women."
5,Healing,I have read the book twice and found it very refreshing. I got a new copy for a friend that was sexually abused.
5,THERE IS HOPE!,"There is grace and there is mercy. As victims we begin to believe that we worthless and hopeless. Joyce Meyer's own story is a powerful testimony of how God can lift us up from the mirey pit and mold us into his image. And isn't the testimony that much more amazing when we've come from such a dark and wicked place where we had no choice? When you do choose to read this book, the devil will start shaking in his boots. Grab hold of an awesome victorious life. Be delivered and transformed! God has plans to prosper you! Prepare to walk through the fire! God is with you and you will not be burned! AMEN!"
5,This Book has opened me up to feel again when I was numb.,"I must say to the respectful and honorable woman of God. That this book has caused me to open doors that I have been to fearful to open and see what was inside. When, I started reading your story. I cried and was so surprised that experiences of abuse and rape have common response and reaction that I thought was an isolated case because it was happening to me. I am not alone and I can get healed, it is up to me. My body, my choice. Thank you, Joyce Meyers and Amazon.com"
3,Does as good as possible for such a useless language,"This book is fairly good for learning Turbo Pascal, but it's examples aren't too great. It is pretty easy to learn from the book, but it seems incomplete. If you want to learn TP, get it, but I suggest learning something else."
4,I couldn't put it down!,"I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be a better parent, spouse, son/daughter or friend. Reading it helped me to see the errors of my ways, a blessing indeed."
5,Putting into Practice,Thank you so much for your work on this beautiful book. The ideas will definitely be put into practice this summer at home. I'm very excited to implement them!
4,The Blessing,"'Have you ever wondered if your parents gave you their blessing? Are you wondering if your giving your own children or friends your blessing? While reading this book you will understand if you have ever received or given a blessing, and if you haven't the Blessing gives you detailed instructions on how to go about giving it.The Blessing is an eye opening book, its very instructive and encouraging. The book contains many places were you are encouraged to stop reading and think about what you have just read. There are many places in the book were you are given a website address were if you would like more information you are able to obtain it. I would greatly recommend this book to pastors or bible study teachers.BookSneeze has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book for review."
4,The Blessings,"I recently recieved a complimentary copy of the book ""The Blessings: Giving the Gift of Unconditional Love and Acceptance"" by John Trent, Ph.D. and Gary Smalley from Thomas Nelson Publishing as part of the Booksneeze book review team. Little did I realize that this book is actually a reprint of a 25 year old book. The subject matter is as applicable today as it was then. The blessing enlightens the reader into the importance of giving and receiving a blessing. It offers explanations, illustrations, benefits, consequences, advice, and challenges to parents and children of all ages. This concept of giving ""The Blessing"" is easy, but it's missed in today's society. If I could I'd put this on the 'must read' list of every potential parent."
5,Great book everyone should read,"I love this book! Learned so much about myself and parenting in general. Now that I'm a parent I'm definitely going to pass on ""the blessing"" that this book talks about. It gave great examples and simple suggestions that are biblically based."
1,Content great! Condition poor.,"I have always been pleased with everything I have ordered through Amazon...except this. This book is fabulous and a must-read for everyone! However, the seller said the condition of it was ""excellent"" and it definitely was not!...cover was yellowed, dirty and torn; pages yellowed. :("
2,read with care,An okay book. Just pick out the good parts and overlook the preaching (there's lots of that).
5,"A must for parents, leaders, everyone","I am often reminded of how awesome my childhood was, and how the many blessings my parents and family gave me have helped shape how I act, react, and bless others.In this revised and updated version of The Blessing, Trent and Smalley intertwine lessons and Scripture, which guides those that have never received the blessing of others, to those that received half-blessings.Blessings are like oxygen and water. We need both to thrive and survive. Whenever you can, bless someone, and be a blessing to everyone you encounter. You never know when a blessing will impact someone's life, but the risk of blessing someone always is beneficial.From talking about how touching blesses others, to our words that invest in the future of our children, this book is a MUST for every parent, boss, leader.My only regret is that I have not read this book prior to now.Blessings!"
4,I wish I had read this years ago...,It would have helped me be a better father. But it's never to late to learn and improve. Don't pass it up.
4,The Blessing... continues..,"This book has taken me a while to review. I honestly forgot that I was supposed to be reviewing it. I have read it over and over.. Reading bits and pieces at a time, going back to the beginning and starting over. I really enjoyed the concept of the book. I love the fact that they acknowledge that our children are our children even after they leave home and they still need ""blessing"" from their parents. Unconditional love and acceptance are what every adult hopes for and looks back on their life to see if they had it. This book gives us guidance on showing our children ""the blessing"" and making sure they know they are blessed. The book also gives us biblical examples of blessings and lost blessings. I know I will continue to be blessed by this book and I hope that it strengthens the blessings I pass on..I recieved this book courtesy of Booksneeze, in exchange for an honest review.. All opinions are my own."
4,Encouraged to do more as a father,"While I felt there was one or two missteps with the use of Old Testament examples, this book challenged me to speak more into the lives of my children."
2,Not my style,"The book follows the premise (for me) of the Five Love Languages. It does have lots of stories in it, which is helpful and maybe the most interesting part to myself.The overall premise feels a bit stretched to me....of emphasizing Big lessons from Small verses in the Bible. I struggled with that aspect, feeling like it was an okay opinion, but a bit shaky to persist in it's importance.The book deals with ""blessing"" or loving/accepting your children by words, action, touch, and tone. The vaild point of the book is, as children, we want our parents to love us unconditionally and accept us. That I agree with. Yet as far as needing to ""Bless"" our kids, I got a bit lost in the authors jargon.I suppose, overall, I am showing my ""Minnesotaness"" and would rate this book as a bit too ""feely"" or ""froofroo"" for my taste. I learned valuable input from the book, but am not likely to pass this on to any other parent"
2,Pretty but that's about it.,"It's pretty enough, but the holes in the strainer are really big, which makes loose tea, which it seemed to be designed for, kinda iffy. Also, the thick lip makes drinking somewhat difficult."
3,Mixed thoughts,"First, the faults - The infuser is ineffective for the loose-leaf black and herbal teas that I own. It keeps out the largest leaves but lets a lot through. Also, the mug conducts heat more than I would prefer.On the positive side, the smooth curved shape is wonderful to hold in my hands. It was lovely to cradle the mug in both hands during cold winter days.Despite its failings, I did buy another one of these mugs as a gift for a friend."
5,I love my tea mug!,"This is the best tea mug! The lid keeps the tea hot while it's steeping, when the tea is ready the lid becomes the setting place for the infuser -- no mess! The mug itself is sturdy and the color is vibrant. It's so great that I had to buy some for friends."
3,Chantal 15-Ounce Tea Mug with Infuser,"Item is pleasant to look at and the basic idea is good, however, this particular design is a little too tippy to be really safe. Was delivered as promised."
1,Meade doesn't care,"I got this item at Costco as well. Initially it worked ok, not very accurate but I figured I didn't get it level enough or something. Then it stopped working at all, would rotate one way but not the other, never would complete an auto-align. I emailed Meade, they responded right away and sent me a new mechanism to use with the scope. Unfortunately, after my intitial excitement that they had fixed the problem, the replacement item arrived. It was a cheaper unit with less features than the one I had purchased. Meade stopped answering any of my emails, and the 2nd unit stopped working shortly thereafter. I'll not loose any more money on empty promises from Meade; their stuff doesn't work and they don't care. Very disappointing. I'm still using the scope occasionally, but it's not the auto aiming scope I paid for. Shame on them!"
3,Watch the wires!,"Unfortunately,we are looking for a new set of headsets. The wiring in my husbands went on the fritz, so that he can hear me, but I cannot hear him. I teased him saying ""Now you can't talk back!"" but I recanted, because I truely miss our motorcycle conversations."
4,My 5 and 7 yr old love this game.,"You would not think that a wooden board and some rocks would keep them entertained but it does. It does take a few times reading the directions over and over to get all the rules of this game. But my 5 and 7 yr old boys can play this game alone without any help. And is one of the few games they own that they play ""by the rules"".I recommend this game but make sure you spend the time to understand the rules."
1,Actual Product Different from Picture on Back of Box,"The board in this box is not what was pictured on the back of the box. I didn't want ""just"" a mancala board. The University Game board pits (U-9916) have elongated pits to hold many stones. The board in this box had circular pits that could not hold very many stones. The board in this box was in shrink wrap but did not even look like the picture on the back of the box.I'm collecting the mancala boards produced by University Games and Great American Trading Company because they have the best boards for little hands. I'll keep searching to complete a classroom set for a Mancala club. The seller reimbursed my money but I still had to pay for postage. I would NOT have purchased this game if I would have known at the beginning that it wasn't produced by University Games."
3,Doesn't hold enough marbles,"Each ""pocket"" can only hold about 6-7 marbles. My 8 year old daughter and I frequently make piles of 10+. This creates a problem to prevent the marbles from going over to the next place and makes it difficult to remove them to count them.On a positive: The game is a lot of fun and my daughter will almost always win and will play for an hour at a time."
2,Annoyed,Did anyone proofread this book before it was published? The numerous errors are distracting.
4,Good Stories,"I was excited to get this book, but a little disappointed with the content. I was hopping it would be all about Joshua Harris's courtship with Shanon, their difficulties, struggles, how it brought them closer to God, etc. It did have little blips of their story, but it was mostly about other people and how they struggled and eventually survived. So overall it was a great book and I would highly recommend it, but I wish there would have been more of Joshua and Shanon's experience."
5,Boy Meets Girl,"This is an excellent book! I read through it, the same day I got it and I plan on reading it over again :) It is very easy to read, very straight forward. This book complements the first book (I Kissed Dating Goodbye) by showing you tangible means of applying what you learn in the first book... Josh has the same passion as the first book.I would recommend this book to ALL singles young, old, divorced and widowed. Actually the lady that I live with is married and she read the book and just wept... this book has reminded her of God's provision, incomparable grace, unmatchable forgiveness and undying love for us... So married folks, don't be turned off-- this is worth reading!God has used this book as a means of grace for me. By God's Spirit this book has served to renew my mind and give me tremendous hope!Blessings people as you read this! Hope it will challenge you and provoke you!"
3,Dumb,"I read this book and decided I do not like Joshua Harris that much, the book itself wasn't very helpful."
3,"Good book, but not too down to earth...","Okay I bought this book because I was looking for some advice on dating, Harris says that christians shouldn't practice ""dating"" instead he referred to ""courting"". The book is interesting, but it's somehow difficult to comprehend nowadays that everyone you go out with is a potential candidate for marriage, so I think Mr. Harris loses the point there. However the book is a pretty good resource on how to keep a relationship according to christian principles. How to develop a potential bond that could leave to marriage if both parts agreed. It's a good book if you want info on how to develop a christian love relationship with someone, but not good on giving you the inside on actually ""how to date/court"" nowadays."
1,Abolutely Ridiculous,"I can't believe this book has gained the popularity it has. Who ever heard of someone getting ""frisky"" just by lying in a hammock?!?!? That is your first warning that this guy has some major issues. Well, at least he is enjoying all the royalties from the sale of this ridiculous book. I'm sure God is pleased about that."
3,Could be better.,"A great example of a godly romance, but Harris fails to realize that his situation cannot be applied to everyone else. He barely give lip service to the fact that different situations will dictate different approaches."
3,Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship,Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship looks good but bored. I am trying to read it all but I am actually at 1 of less than 150 pages. LOL!!!
2,Not for people older than 14,"I am a university student, age 20, and I read this book recently with my girlfriend. The author had some wonderful ideas and topics, yet, I felt like I was in Junior High again. If I was in 7th or 8th grade and I got this book, I think I would have really liked it. Yet at present it felt like he was talking down to me.A lot of the ideas I already knew and unfortinually I was on the next to last chapter before I made notes of anything in the book (and yes, I like to make notes when I see things that stand out to me or are things I should remember).I can see this man as being a wonderful Junior High Youth Pastor and God will definately bless that. But if you are older than that age I would recommend getting something else."
1,Don't buy this book,"Harris' book is a waste of time. He goes to great lengths to condemn the term dating, then dress it up again as ""courtship"", while claiming that they're different. They're not.He is not an expert, has no real information to back his ideas, and doesn't have Biblical backing for his stance.That said, he is a charming writer, and a good story teller. But his theories on dating are rather silly.This book does at least fix some of the problems from his first book, but it greatly inferior to other material in this area (e.g. ""I Gave Dating a Chance"" by Clark)."
2,Redundancy Alert!,"I've read ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" as well as ""Boy Meets Girl,"" and my conclusion is that they are both the same book. Well, almost. I liked a lot of Josh Harris's first book. He offered some good godly wisdom in ""Dating,"" and he offers some in ""BMG"" as well, but he doesn't really say anything new. So I recommend that you either read one or the other, but don't waste your time reading ""BMG"" if you've already read ""Dating."""
5,Changed my view on Courtship,"I feel this book is a must for anyone -- whether single or currently in a relationship. While somewhat of a ""radical"" view of courtship and Christian relationships, I feel that it gives a very real and Christ-centered alternative to the way that our culture views relationships. It encourages readers to focus on Christ in their love and to remember who brought them together. It also encourages readers to evaluate their relationship and really look at it through the eyes of Christ. What does He want for your love? What does He intend? What are your motives, etc? I found it totally changed my perspective on dating and courtship. I fully intend to implement many of the concepts in my dating relationships in the future. An amazing book."
1,"You thought ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" was bad enough!!","This book is worse. The book is written in the defense mechanism mode to defend his last book which unfortunately in many churches took one man's ideology and turned it into the legalistic ""only way"" theology of all. This may have worked for the harrises but it is not the ""official Christian perspective"" of dating for everyone."
1,"Johs Harris, Hypocrite?",Didn't Mister Harris ask his future wife out on date the first time he met her?
3,Joshua Harris,Some of the principles recommended may not be too practical but as a general guide it should suffice with lots of guidance from a parent/s.
5,Practical and Honest,"I thought I kissed dating goodbye was alright. But, I was still bursting with questions: what happens when I do meet the right person?, do I ever date?,What are my guidelines?In this second installment,questions such as these are answered. But, its not done in a generic, one way for all. Rather Joshua offers practical guidelines on to how to have a honest, pure and God honoring courtship.I really appreciated his candidacy as he shared areas he struggled with pure thoughts and where Shannon(his now wife), struggled sharing her past. I dont have any courting prospects yet, but I know this book would be heavily used when that time comes.Much worth getting in my opinion"
4,SOUND ADVICE,"I must admit I wasn't all impressed by "" Kissed Dating Goodbye"" However this book gives great advice I would recommend it to any Believer who is in a relationship or is wondering how to go about a relationship. It has helped me to put more emphasis on the friendships that I have with women than to pursue romance hastily. I will personally be teaching a bible study on Dating & Courtship this Spring on this book. A must buy"
4,Good read,This was a good book with helpful ideas and instructions to keep dating and courtship biblical. I'd recommend the 1st half for single people and the second for couples.
5,2004 Mercedes E55 AMG,"Used these on my E55, I've had them for 5K miles and no issues so far.Swapped out the pads with these ones and changed rotors at the same time (Centric OEM equivalent). It's a bit hard to judge the braking ability of these as they're on the rear brakes.They've been relatively dust-free so far and no noises."
2,Compare to other sellers claims before deciding,Binoculars appear to be well constructed but at 3-1/4 pounds are heavier than the 2 pounds claimed by Sharper Image. The field of view is very small. When fully zoomed I am unable to hold the binoculars steady without holding them against something because of their weight. The adjustments are not quick or easy to make. If you do buy these you should consider buying the tripod to hold them steady while you look through them. Sharper Image would not respond to my e-mail inquiry about incorrect weight claims by them. Their telephone customer service people did not provide any assisitance either.Won't make this mistake again!
2,dont buy,"On the lower zoom settings these are excellent binoculars...on high..the field of view is reduced to a tiny little circle you cant even see crap though...I thought about returning these for a refund, but even on 20x-50x they are way better than the 7x binoculars I have...they are just not even any where near as great as the 140X ads make it sound...there is a reason the company went bankrupt selling these I guess."
3,"Mixed, but over all pleasing, bag","It takes a lot to ruin a Clash song. I frequently skip the NO DOUBT contribution, and the ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go"" horrorshow. ((shudder)) The Indigo Girls turned CLAMPDOWN into something you'd hear at a folk rock Hootinanie - shockingly, I dig it. Could have done without THIRD EYE BLIND, and SILVERCHAIR. ""Clash City Rockers"" is blistering - love it! ""White Riot"" is hysterical - adding a layer of satirical racist irony. It is impossible to ruin LOST IN THE SUPERMARKET. I go back and forth on STRAIGHT TO HELL."
1,Unbelievable shipping,Had this in cart and ready to buy when after a bit of research (info not readily available) realized the excessive cost of shipping. Such cost make this product less than feasible to try?
2,Not very pleased with this product,"There were good and bad things about this product. I liked that it had easier questions for children, but the questions were a big problem. They asked like 3 questions on blue whales, and missed many other important areas of science and nature. I found the adult questions to be laughably easy (there were a lot of true/false questions), or so obscure or unclear that they were not ""fair"" questions. I think that a game like trivial pursuit while it does not offer easier questions in the standard set for children, has much better thought out questions that are consistent and cover a broad range of topics!"
4,Great family game,"This game is so much like ""Trivial Pursuit"", you could use the questions and categories from any of those editions to handicap the game even further. I played with two young adults (under 18) and some of the questions for younger players were completely unknown to them.The best part is that you can only answer one question a turn (right or wrong) so a ""Ken Jennings"" can't win the game on the first roll of the dice.There aren't enough questions supplied with the game, but as I noted above, any multi-category trivia game questions can be used to keep the game interesting. Overall, an excellent purchase for families that enjoy an evening of trivia."
2,okay..,The game is good but the directions are not. We sat down to play the game but it took us a long time to understand the rules.
5,Really fun puzzle!,"My family always does a puzzle together over the christmas holiday and we thoroughly enjoyed this one. The many musical instruments were fun to find, and all included little names so it was cool to learn about all the instruments too. Highly recommend this puzzle."
4,A bit tight and a bit elfish.,"I have a large head, and this is a bit tight, but still just wearable. Now, even with my large head, unless I have it pulled down really tight it's pointy and makes me look like a Christmas elf. It is toasty warm and I won't hesitate to wear this hat while shoveling my driveway, in a snowstorm, in the dark."
5,BioHacking Bible,"This clear, complete and well illistrated book was designed for labs in developing countries that wish to use PCR technology. It also happens to be the perfect manual for those interested in hacking DNA in their kitchens and basements.If you're interested in actually working with DNA technology and your resources are limited, this is THE book."
3,Too easy for the 9-12 crowd,"I thought the idea of the series was cute so I bought books 1-4 for my 8yo sold (3rd grade). I read the books I buy him first, just so I'm familiar with the content and so I can test his comprehension. I read this one last nite and was disappointed.I try and buy a level above his so that a book will be a challenge for him, but this was definitely not challenging for an 8yo let alone 9-12 as suggested on the site. The concepts were repetitive. The vocabulary was limited. The overall subject was funny and my 8yo will find it amusing, so that's good.The book was cute, and I will keep the four I have as more recreational reading for him, but as part of his nightly reading assignments/reading log, I'll keep searching for more robust chaper books."
5,Fun for the early school set,"The first in a wonderfully entertaining series, Miss Daisy is a second grade teacher who needs her students to help her with things she is supposed to be teaching! Imagine the power Miss Daisy's class feels when they get to ""help"" their nutty teacher.Fun for new readers and for parents to read aloud to pre-schoolers and kindergarten kids just adapting to school, Dan Gutman has a light touch in showing kids that school can be fun. With so much emphasis on standardized test scores it's great to see that there is someone out there reminding our children that reading can make you smile!"
1,don't like the language,"We received this book as a gift for my daughter who is 7. We read some together last night with my 4 year old son, and all of us were not happy with the language. The first chapter is titled ""I hate school"". My kids like school, and I don't want them hearing about kids that ""hate"" school, or anything else! My daughter asked me to say ""don't like"" as a substitute for all of the times the word ""hate"" was used. Also the word ""dumb"" was used often, which is not a word that we like either. My kids seemed to not really like the book because of the language, and I think I will be passing this book on."
1,MAKE SURE TO PREVIEW THESE SONGS!!!,"Most of these are NOT the songs you've heard on the radio, or on regular album releases. Some of these say they were rerecorded, but the ones that don't say it were also. Preview them all before deciding."
4,"You say toy, I say learning tool.","I purchased this product to use as a training tool for adult education. It is great for teaching problem solving, teambuilding and Lean manufacturing princples such as pull systems and cellular manufacturing.The pieces are durable and because they are magnetic, they can be used in a variety of ways. All it takes is a little imagination."
