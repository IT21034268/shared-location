4,Excelente Calzado,"Tengo estos zapatos desde hace más de dos años. Los utilizo para trotar y son fantásticos, muy cómodos y livianos. Como inconveniente puedo señalar que la zuela se despegó en la punta de los zapatos (inconveniente menor, ya que simplemente les eché pegamento y listo) pero no puedo señalar a ciencia cierta si fue por el uso o porque mi esposa los lavó en la lavadora."
3,Fine with lead,"Using a small tip I have never been able to get it hot enough for the new no-lead solder. I may be able to correct this with a bigger tip, but then I have the wrong tip for most other work. Solution, buy a cheap china station with a large tip. I myself like lead, I like the taste and smell and adds real zip to salsa."
5,Unbelievably entertaining,"The Four Seasons are amazing and this proves they always have been. This is such a phenomenal compilation of no less than two dozen beautiful and amazing songs. The Seasons have such a way with zooming harmony and unlimited falsetto, and they don't hold anything back. I'm addicted. This has to be one of the most revealing, versatile and supremely melodramatic examples of their work. Only the REAL Jersey Boys could do these audio acrobatics. Turn off the phone and lock the doors for maximum enjoyment."
4,Two Great Albums in One,"The folk music bug was flying high during the early '60s. It even bit the biggest band of the era, The Four Seasons.The pairing of these two albums shows that the Seasons could handle any style as good as the rest.Folk-Nanny (later re-titled ""Stay and Other Hits"") is a great laid-back album that showcases the Seasons harmonies. Born To Wander was a continuation of that formula. Frankie Valli was the lead vocalist, but these recordings show that Bob Gaudio, Tommy Devito, and Nick Massi could wail right behind him (or out front with him) and hold their own.The entire band was a triple threat with songwriting, singing, and performing. These albums show that The 4 Seasons were much more than a musical group. They were musical geniuses."
3,Not their best,I realize that this is their first album and they were all very young when they made it but even so I really feel like this record isn't even close to as good as their following two albums were. I'm glad I found it but I would only recommend to hardcore fans of the band.
2,I've read better books,"Old Jules is not a bad book, it's just too long for one thing. The characters and their lifestyle are quite unique but their lackluster day to day existence needn't have taken up so many pages. If you want gripping, white-knuckle excitement, look elsewhere. The book is interesting from a historical point of view maybe but it just wasn't my kind of read. (Ho-hum........)"
2,Tough Read,"I would like to write a favorable review of this book, but I honestly can't. You see, I am a Nebraskan and my father knew the Sandoz family growing up in western Nebraska. However, this is a hard book to read and at times, as dull and lifeless as the Nebraska prarie that Ms Sandoz describes. For someone looking to learn more about western Nebraska during the late 1800's to early 1900's I suggest picking up a Willa Cather novel."
1,There is a reason there are only 5 reviews for this book!,"There is no real reason to read this book, it is monotinous life on the old prarie. Only without the excitment of actually living it. You have to sit through and suffer page after page as he describes how flat the prarie is. Go outside and look at your lawn! Wow that was more exciting then hearing Mari describe dirt for five pages! For your own sake don't buy this book. Give the money to some starving children in Rwanda instead."
5,A stellar work of literature as well as historical,"This book is captivating! The imagery is vivid; the language precise and economical. The writing style has a unique rhythm that really brings this story to life. The fact that it is historically accurate adds all the more. This book is a classic of American, particularly Western American, literature. I believe you will thank me for this recommendation if you buy, and read, this book."
5,The Shaping of an Author,"Old Jules was tough, mean, revengeful, yet his daughter went on to become one of the best historical writers of the west. He would get mad when you Mari wrote fiction, or did anything for that matter. Yet he showed her, lived the example of writing, corresponding daily to make his points with politicians, friends and associates. He was tough and mean, but what Mari Sandoz brings to light in this excellent biography are his essential qualities of hard work, perseverience, education and human equality. People with those qualities shaped America, particularily the west. Old Jules open welcome of Native Americans clearly had an impact on Mari Sandoz, showing in her excellent books on the Cheyenne nation and her biography of Crazy Horse. Because Mari is writing about her father, this book helps show not only how a man helped shape his community, but how he helped shape the future of the nation."
4,Buy this book as a reader,"If your kids are following the Eyewitness Readers series, then get this book for that purpose.If you are looking for a kids book on sharks, I would suggest you look elsewhere. This book was designed as a reader book about sharks. This book is excellent for that purpose."
3,What was that,"Rodney Fox had almost run out of time. He needed to find a fish and fast. To win he needed to find a local fish a big one too. He won last year and he wanted to win again. But today something will happen, what will happen? Several other divers were fishing and caught a lot of fish and the smell of blood was around.When you read this book you will see what will happen to Rodney Fox.I liked this book because I love sharks, and I want to study them, and you will to throughout this book.This book was written by Cathy East Durbowski."
2,Shabby Publishing,"This book contains excellent text but desperately needs a better publisher. The maps and reproductions of paintings are in dingy, blurry black and white. They look as if they are 1970's-era photocopies of 1960's-era photocopies. On page 124 there are illustrations of a grenadier and a drummer with the descriptions exactly reversed. In short, this edition of ""Decisive Day"" is not a book that you will be proud to have on your shelf. Do yourself a favor and borrow a copy from a library -- perhaps earlier editions had quality control worthy of the text."
5,Excellent reading,"Richard Ketchum has written a fantastic narrative history of this important early battle of the American Revolution. For years, early American history has been one of my biggest interests and I can honestly say I've never read a book from this period that was as gripping as Ketchum's. It rivals David McCullough's ""Truman"" with its ability to pull the reader in, making him feel as if he's in the midst of the battle. Furthermore, he displays an intimate knowledge of both the particulars of Bunker Hill as well as 18th century warfare in general. Highly recommended."
3,Canon digital Rebel XTI with deluxe accessory kit,"I was excited about the camera, but disappointed in the contents of the accessory kit. The LCD screen protectors were missing and the compact flash card reader was broken. If I had to do it again, I would just buy the camera and get accessories on my own."
2,Disappointing and boring book,"I was very disappointed in this book that came highly recommended by the authors of the ""Nanny Diaries"" and was featured on The Today Show. I found the book to be utterly boring, and extremely repetitive. The author had many opportunities to expand on what could have been interesting characters and storylines, but instead just plodded along. The only positive thing I could say is that I did enjoy the author's writing style. But her storytelling abilities left left something to be desired."
5,Pack this one in your beach bag...,"I just loved this book! You can't help but love Clara, Georg, and even Tamar. The story worked at a great pace with small surprises thrown in when you least expected. One of the ways I know that a book is really great is that it plays out almost like a movie in my head, and that is the vivid manner in which Alison McGhee wrote each scene and dialogue between her characters. There was an equal mixture of funny, thoughtful, heartwarming, (and tear-jerking-is that a word? ) moments to keep a reader both entertained and enlightened. I agree with another one of the reviewers that I would love to learn the next installment of Clara's life! (sequel, sequel! )"
3,The voice was all wrong,"I agree with a few others who felt the girl's voice was annoying and condescending. Written from a 13 year old's point of view, looking back at when she was 11, simply didn't work. Despite her being a reader and ultra smart, the language was that of an adult. For example, To Kill A Mockingbird is told from an adult Scout's pov, looking back, not 6 or 7 year old Scout talking. Clara as an adult would have made the story believable."
2,Shadow Baby,"I was very disappointed in this book I would not recommend it. It was OK, but the excitemnt just wasn't there."
4,"Sweet, sad and redemptive","McGhee's Clara is a precociously strong-voiced character, but I didn't find her unbelievably so. Instead, I quickly developed affection for her, and smiled at her quirks, like inventing book reports. The novel centers around the friendship she develops with an old man in her town. McGhee is a skillful writer and has crafted lovely characters, as she did in her previous novel, Rainlight. There are some terribly sad moments, but they are ultimately redeemed in this complex, beautifully written novel."
4,Strange book,"I am not sure how to rate this book. It was very bizzare. I did like the references to the Utica area. This made it a little more interesting for me. This book comes from a perspective of a young teenage girl and at times is a little hard to follow. Although it was weird, it was a good read."
5,Brings Back Great Memories,"This CD has two great popular Mexican birthday songs (""Las Mananitas"" and ""En Tu Dia"") that bring back great memories. My father used to play these two songs anytime someone had a birthday. I am so glad that Amazon.com provides samples of the songs so that we know what we are buying!"
1,No samples!,"The last reviewer says that there are samples to listen to. Well, if there were, there aren't anymore! What happened to the samples? I agree the samples are crucial so that we know if it's what we want."
1,Cute But Fell Apart,"The latch is easy to use and secure, always important for pacifier chains, but my 6 month old loved to chew on the wooden hearts and the cord broke! When it fell apart we had a close disaster with her almost swallowing small beads!! Not a good thing."
5,"""Blacksheep"" Ballad","This ballad tells the actual life of 1920's outlaw Haney Liddell. In fact, it is a musical narration or ""soundtrack"" that accompanies the book Bah, Bah, Blacksheep. It is reminiscent of the type of story-in-song that Johnny Cash might have embraced. The singer/songwriter displays a hefty dose of the talent and commercial appeal inherent in modern Texas musicians. His clever lyrics and expressive voice capture the essence of Liddell's fall from grace. The book and CD perfectly complement each other."
5,A review,Very good book. Phil Valentine is a very popular radio talk show host.He also knows how to write as well.
5,Silky smooth skin,"It's very thick, so you only need to use a little bit. It doesn't leave your skin oily, but does leave your skin very smooth and healthy-feeling even after just one use. The scent is very faint, so you won't bother your co-workers. A million times better than Eucerin cream. One minor issue about the container: it's kind of triangle-shaped so it's possible to screw the lid on with the base and lid triangle points not matching up."
4,Very enjoyable read,"A very enjoyable second novel by an old friend at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Full of intriging twists and turns centered around the Naval Shipyard at Bremerton in Washington State. This book should be especially entertaining for persons, past or present, who have worked at the Shipyard. Keep up the good work Mike. I can't wait for your next book."
4,Must read,"This book is riveting, however, at times repeats itself. I did not mind this at all. A page turner every time I picked up the book. Enjoy!"
4,fun sequel,I really enjoy the deMarco series. I find the characters engaging and enjoy learning about both their pasts and future adventures.
3,decent iron,"good replacement for the american version of the stanley #4 and #5 bench planes. with a properly set up chip breaker, this does a quite serviceable job in both a smoothing plane or a jack plane depending on the camber that you grind into the edge. (~8"" radius works well for jack plane to a barely noticeable camber for smoothing plane.)the steel appears to take an edge well, and holds it for a reasonable period."
2,Great idea? Warning.,"This looked like a great way to organize the tools in my garage. I set it up and later that night heard a crash. It had fallen over with the top half separating from the bottom. We set it up again, this time putting a brick at the back for weight. It fell over again! A few days later I discovered dents and scratches in my car caused by the longer tools falling into it! Do not use this for many long items or anything heavy. I bought it mainly for snow shovels and rakes, which was the majority of clutter in my garage. It should be mounted to the wall (Rubbermaid does not suggest this in the instructions) or used for smaller lightweight items which, in that case, is more practical to just hang up."
2,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","The design of this is flawed: Once you put items in the front positions, it is a pain in the neck to get to the tools in the back. You end up pulling things out overhead and the handles of those items invariably knock the front items out of their positions. Opt for a wall-mount or bucket system instead."
4,A useful product,"This is the second one of these I have owned. It provides excellent storage, particularly in a corner, with the ability to see your stuff and get the proper tool out without digging around in a jumbled pile of shovels and rakes, etc. It is not heavily built (i.e., a little wiggly when loaded), so if you are going to put heavy things in it (and even if not) I suggest securing it to the fence or wall, preferably in a corner, to give it more stability. My first one held up to Nevada outdoor use for at least two+ years, before I moved, so it is apparently pretty sun-resistant."
4,Helps in small spaces,"Helps organize a small corner in my garage, so it serves its purpose. Wish it bigger holes for the handles, but other than that not too bad."
3,useful but feeble,had to devise a method to prevent tilting by heavy weight broomsI managed to do so but doubt it will be long lasting
4,Wish I purchased this sooner,I would give this five stars but I have one shovel with a large handle that would not fit in the largest slot for this organizer. This makes getting at these type of tools a breeze now. Assembly takes 10 seconds. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,"Decent, but could be better.",I purchased this to keep all of my garden tools in. It was super easy to put together and required no tool. I locaded it with tools and it seemed to hold all 25 of them fine. It's just a little wobbly. For the price it I still think it was a good deal. As long as you don't have a ton of tools I would recommend this product.
3,A little flimsy,"This is ok if you do not plan on moving it. Once you lift the unit, it will fall apart because the base & top are not connected to the leg supports, except for the supports being inserted into the fitted hole/bracket. The base & top seem sturdy, but would be nice if there were screws or something to securely attach the leg supports. And it does not accomodate for large handled tools."
5,nice and compact,great for the corner of your garage to place brooms and shoevels. Need to have it against the wall to stablize it. Looks neat and clean great for organizing and decluttering your garage
4,Organized Garden Tools,"Love this item, now my tool are not up against the wall and all over the yard. Good product."
3,Great concept but durability is an issue,"I originally bought this item @ a local store, after going aha! all my tool storage problems solved. It was easy to put together and use, saving me tons of space. After a years' use the item seems to sag a bit more than usual and the base where the tools sit is breaking through more frequently. I guess what I need for my use is the same design in metal and fastened to the wall stud. Overall its a great design that is limited by the material its made of."
1,Can't handle the weight,"I purchased this item to use in the unused corner of my shop. The rack is not tall enough to be stable, and frequently spilled the tools onto the floor. Could be used for small tools, but not with tools with long handles, like those in the picture. They must have taken the picture in the moments before the unit fell over. It now resides in an unused corner of my dumpster."
4,Good Product,"Easy to assemble, durable Rubermaid construction.The garage and house tools tend to be top heavy, mops and brooms,so either mount it to the wall or put some weight on the base to keep it from tipping."
1,bottoms up,The thing falls over if you don't have the tools properly spaced with weight even out! Pain and my husband doesn's like it! Wasn't a good gift and I think I will drill it to the wall so it doesn't bottom's up again!
5,Just what I needed,"I got this item to organize a garden tool mess. I had it opened and put together in 5 minutes, put it out in the storage building and put 20 or so tools in it from shovels to axes. Wow did it make a better way of doing things than hanging stuff on the wall. A real space saver and you can access your tools easily since the plastic unit keeps them up and separated from each other(unlike a barrel)."
1,Total misguidence!,"I read your book and I cannot help but disagree entirely of how being of a certain faith, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, can cause any mental illness. I was laughing in disbelief. I think you should wright about possitive things and not twist things around so as to make something you personally detest, bad."
1,How dare he!!,"I ran across this book by pure coincidence. What kind of audacity this author must have to assume that just because someone is a Jehovah's Witness that he or she is mentally ill!! Mental illness strikes people of all races, cultural, economical, AND RELIGIOUS backgrounds. As a Jehovah's Witness myself, I can attest to the fact that I AM NOT, REPEAT, AM NOT mentally ill. I am mentally sound and feel confident that I have made the right decision in choosing to become a Witness. The author of this atrocious publication should tuck his tail between his legs and head back to the writing table."
5,"Expat Southerner, now living in New Zealand","I live in New Zealand and only occasionally get back to the South...Pegasus Records, bless their musical taste, of Florence ALA sold me this, and said I might enjoy it...well...it might be the best 35 minutes of Pure rock & blues in my collection of 15,000 cds...I just wish he recorded more! First, he can flat out play...secondly he can sing...thirdly, all the songs have an amazing sense of urgency...My ultimate wish is, one of these days that I am back in Tennessee or north Alabama, to catch Travis and his band at a live gig...I really don't think it could get any better!"
3,That's a really big donut,"I used to see this at Tower Records back in the late 90's. Basically it's a one-disc distillation of Asia's two Archiva albums, which were a collection of demos, outtakes and B-sides spanning 1991-1996. Geoff Downes is the only original member of Asia here, and John Payne is the vocalist on all tracks. Various contributors on guitar and drums are featured (including the gorgeous Steve Howe instrumental ""Ginger"".)Basically, if you're already a dedicated Asia fan who's buying albums of their (mostly rather interesting) outtakes, then you'll want the full two discs. Don't bother with this one."
1,Stop the madness.....,"quit putting out repackaged stuff. What's even worse is the sound quality from the lousy recordings. No, the original line-up isn't coming back, we all know that. Change the name of band, Geoff. Quit hanging on to the name. Anyone who gave this more than 1 star really needs to recognize that the band now stinks. A Buggles reunion would now be in order to put the name Asia out of its misery."
2,Too soft,These are too soft to be used as pillows. They compress to nearly paper thickness when you lay on them.
3,pilla,Is what it is. not the most compact pillow if your are going to take and put it in your back pack but for a camp pillow it does just nice
1,A bunch of nothing,"The book started off promising, as it started off right away with a description of the old man's body being found. However, after a few chapters, the book becomes repetitive and is more concerned with the feelings of Susan, and how she dealt with her childhood. Enough already! And not to spoil the ending for anyone, just let me say, it did not end well. The loose ends were not resolved, and in fact because Bobby was not tried yet in the last case, there is nothing to say. Is he guilty or not? I thought so, but by law we know nothing! What was the point of this book? To write a bunch of questions about a possible killer's motives? The book was prematurely written as Bobby is still awaiting trial in Texas. It seems that St. Martins Press merely wants to make money on a book that is not worth your time! Pass on this book. I am glad I only checked it out at the library as it is not worth paying a cent for."
4,a seminal work on dreams i would give it a 4.5 if i could,"owen flanagan does it once again in a great naturalistic work that sketches a controversial but logical theory in a controversial field. With experience in the philosophic, neuroscientific, and psychological fields owen is more than capable of proving his theory that dreams are not spandrels of sleep, they are fitness enhancing and although a biproduct of evolution are self expressive. He tackles all the neccessary and interesting questions from all his fields and creates an overal complex but clear and illuminating work that is a extreme pleasure to read"
1,Huh?,How can this be the highest rated at 350 ft lbs when the 1/2 drive cordless Milwaukee is rated 450 ft lbs
1,moronic,"This is the most moronic thing I have ever been pressured into buying. New moms will buy almost anything to keep their baby safe, and this is the perfect example. I wish I'd just cut out a big piece of cardboard to fit the crib size and put that under the mattress. There is truthfully ZERO reason to spend more than $2.00 on a piece of wood. I mean...seriously. I blame myself, really. But I warn all of you...this is an absurd purchase."
3,Not as advertised,"This really wasn't as advertised, however I knew that going into the purchase and bought it anyway. It simply made life easier, so I'd say (only because of saved effort) worth the 13.99."
1,This is NOT actually an AngelCare product!!!,"I spoke with Natalie Laffe from Angelcare moments ago (they are in Canada). It turns out this product is made by a former partner of theirs called ""Bebesounds"" which was actually sold to ""Graco."" And Angelcare was not happy with Graco's business. Their business relationship no longer exists. All of these boards are unsold inventory from Graco. They are no longer manufactured. Even Natalie from Angelcare said this board is overpriced and that all you need is a board that is bigger than the sensor to keep the sensor from being bent or damaged by slats or springs. And get this, she said it doesn't have to be made of Masonite! She said that wood would work fine. If you want to know if any product is made by, affiliated with, or endorsed by Angelcare, you need only to look at the Angelcare website and click on ""products."" If it's not there, then they don't make it. Hope this helps!"
3,What it says it is,It's what it says it is. Just a board. You don't really need this particular one. It doesn't even look like the picture. I only got it because I wanted to be SURE I had something that would work right with the monitor.
1,Go to Home Depot instead,"The price for this piece of Masonite is ridiculous. Go to Home Depot and get a piece of 1/4"" plywood or a piece of Masonite for 10x less. The Angelcare monitor, however, is totally worth it--five stars!"
1,Garbage!!!,Looks nothing like the advertised picture. Go to your local Lowe's or Home Depot and get this cut way cheaper.
2,Much smaller than I expected,"This board is small. I mistakenly though it would cover at least part of my son's bassinet, but it doesn't even reach from side to side, much less the length of it. I should have listened to other reviewers and went to home depot and had them cut me a small board."
5,A book that stands the test of time,"It stood the test of time for me anyway, since I used to read this book in bed every night when I was about 14 or 15 and marvelled not only at the world of the Beatles but at the way that Schaffner's words opened up a realm of ideas whose breadth I could only intuit at the time. I just finished rereading the book again, 25 years later, and it still strikes me as elegantly written, passionate, honest, insightful and at times very humorous. (The way he speaks about McCartney's solo career is particularly funny). In 1977, he wrote, ""As usual the wild card of the lot is John Lennon.""I think this is the book about the Beatles we all wish we had written. My copy is in tatters, and has a torn-up dust-jacket with the Rubber Soul fish-eyed lens photograph. I will never part from it!"
4,home town guys,"OK, I'm not a big fan of reggae (especially reggae with a ""Let's all blame the U.S. twist) but I gotta say these guys are really good. They sing in local dialect (Bernalda, Matera, southern Italy) which is cool. (Get your friends to guess what the heck language they are speaking!) Even cooler, my son is getting bass lessons from the guitarist, and the singer's dad is his high school Latin and History teacher! Exciting globalization here in Bernalda! You go guys, great luck on your next release, coming soon."
1,The book is like paying for advertisement,"Well what can I say. The author started talking about his secret thumb therapy and from then on kept repeating cases after cases, without achieving much. It was like reading an ad for a therapy which was never discussed. Even from a general medical interest standpoint the material has little to offer.Buying the book was a waste of money, reading it was a waste of time."
3,"Good for drywall, not so good for wood","I live in an older house and am doing a small remodeling job, including replacing some drywall. As it aged, one of the studs had bowed in a knotty area, pushing out the new drywall unacceptably. I needed to plane the bow out of the wood so that the new drywall would lie flat.I bought this plane after reading the good reviews. I agree with the others that this tool is perfect for trimming the edges of the drywall itself - works much, much better than a utility knife. However, it failed for the main purpose, which is to plane the bow out of the stud.I think this plane would have worked well with a new stud, since pine is so soft nowadays. However, the 60-year old wood is too much for this plane to handle. I'd give this tool one star for planing old wood and five stars for planing the edge of drywall, averaging a score of three stars."
1,Terrible plane...,"this is really not even a plane; it works more like a gouge and scaper. If you plan to use it on wood, don't! Don't make the same mistake I did. All I got was gouges all over my board. The ergonomics of this unit is just horrid. Your hand will get tired after a few strokes. Buy a real planer if you want to work on wood."
1,Very Disappointed,"When I read the description of the movie, I was eager to view it. The description depicted this movie as christian based but it is far from it. I know the concept of trying to make the movies more relevant to todays society, but the language used drastically took away from the movie. Also, since Maya, the main character is suppose to learn about God's grace through the decisions and trials that she endured, I did not see the relevance of praying to her mother. I was truly upset concerning this purchase and view it as a waste of money if you are looking for a good, clean, and informative Christian movie."
5,realistic and redeeming,"I had seen this movie before and wanted it so i went in search of and found it here. this is a great movie about being at the bottom and selfless people lending a helping hand that makes the difference. People who can be nonjudgemental and encouraging, and someone working hard to get back to a 'normal' life."
4,Astronaut Food,"Any of us who grew up during the U.S. space age should use items like this as a way to introduce today's kids to the excitement of the late '60s/early '70s. This is an inexpensive and fun gift (buy several -- they won't go stale! -- including some of this ice cream for yourself to feel young again.) Last Christmas my 9-year-old niece made a face over the freeze-dried strawberries (they were indeed a bit sour) and seemed to turn her nose up at the chicken-and-rice meal. I thought my cool idea had been a bust. This year, however, she reminded me of the astronaut food and requested more. Score!"
3,"Delicious, but you're paying for packaging","I was doing a space unit during camp this year, and thought this would be a fun addition. The kids loved it! However, we had snack afterwards and one of the students had freeze dried apples that were nearly identical only packaged as a regular old snack... his were easier to obtain and cheaper as well."
1,"cheap, does not hold pressure well, valve ends do not fit well or snug to the bulb, for air only.","cheap, does not hold pressure well, valve ends do not fit well or snug to the bulb, for air or gases only. Fluid will not work well."
5,Waking Up In Charleston,"I got hooked on Sherryl Woods with Flamingo Diner and since look for everything she writes this was the conclusion of an older trilogy her most recent was Magnolia series just all about real people real life, one a person can sink into and forget who they are or where they are, for awhile..............."
4,Sweet Book,This was a great book to read while I was visiting South Carolina on vacation. I enjoyed the book and the sweet story
2,Hope I can finish it...30 pages to go...,First let me say I am a big fan of Sherryl Woods. I love the first two books in this series and looked forward to reading this book. But..from the start I have had a real hard time with Amanda. She is so angry and so unwilling to forgive or forget...that she has just about made me put the book down. Caleb isn't much better with the secrets he is keeping. I wish I could have written in this review that I loved this book...just can't say it.
4,Does the job,This little thing does the job and keeps the violin out so that my daughter has no excuses about violin practice. Also looks quite nice.
4,Gardenia scent,This perfume is a touch on the sweet side. Some might prefer that. I like it a little more green or flowery. Seems a good value and will make a nice gift for someone I know who likes sweeter scents.
2,Great Fragrance!,"This might seem like a little bottle to you, but if you like gardenias you'll love the scent! It is concentrated so just a little dab is enough and the contents last a long time this way. I will definately buy it again."
5,It's a specialized tool.,"I use this tool for surfboard construction. The blade is small enough to fit into tight spots, and it works on wood, resin, and fiberglass with equal aplomb. Obviously, you'd want to use an appropriate tool for flat surfaces, but this fits the bill for what it was designed for, i.e., trimming, and tight spots."
1,extremely efficient wood gouge,"Having used the product as shown on the cardboard insert, there is only one positive thing to say. Gouging my wood has never been easier, faster, or safer. It has given me lots to practice to hone my wood filler skills."
3,Good laugh over this one!,I had a good laugh on my older kids telling them I had a Christmas movie they had to watch(they love me too much to say no) and then bringing this one out! My only disappointment was that it was not the original cast.
2,Not the cozy family of munsters I remember,Not what I expected. The other characters are too scary for my little ones to enjoy. But I should have known better.
1,Munster's Christmas,It was okay.But I didn't like the fact that it wasn't the orginal members..I would not recommend for purchase....Was rather boring also...
1,munsters scary little christmas,i was disappointed that the characters were different from the original and not as good
4,A NICE LITTLE MADE FOR TV CHRISTMAS MOVIE,"Faring a little better than Edward Herrmann, but still no Fred Gwynne. Then again who ever could be? Sam MacMurray turns out a heartwarming childlike performance as he tries to bring the meaning and spirit of Christmas to his family. Especially Eddie. I will be picking this one up. And I hope they'll release the predecessor HERE COME THE MUNSTERS also. You know and I know nothing can ever come close to the original series. But at least their hearts are in the right place."
2,very disappointed,"My son loves the origninal Munsters - and I ordered this just for fun. I knew it was not the original cast, but I still had reasonable hopes. This was very disappointing. While the actors did a good job of filling their roles - the story was much edgier than any other Munster show I have seen. Santas elves were portrayed as selfish little horny brats, there were several instances of inappropriate innuendo, and there was foul language. Had I known I would not have bought it for my son. I dont think the original cast would have approved of what was done - I know I didnt."
3,THE MUNSTERS' SCARY LITTLE CHRISTMAS,"I DIDN'T LIKE THIS TOOOOOO MUCH...........I LIKED THE OLD MUNSTERS' THE BEST, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS MOVIE, I WAS VERY DISAPOINTMENT......."
1,Poor recording- no wonder it is so cheap!,"Both movies contain some funny (yet silly) jokes. But if you care at all about the quality--do not purchase this 2-movie set. The picture is fuzzy, and the sound is poor, especially in ""Trinity is Still My Name."" Try to find a different recording of these movies."
2,"FM-eral delight, everlasting disappointment","The low price led me to purchase the Dynex Digital FM Transmitter for use with my MP3 player in my older model car. Unfortunately the mantra that you get what you pay for applies to this device.After roughly a month of use, the power connector began shorting out, eventually refusing to stay powered while connected. I eventually surrendered to using AAA batteries. However, six months later, the audio connector began showing similar shorting issues. It is now a lesson in futility finding a suitable resting position for the device without garbling the signal from the MP3 player.I was fortunate to not witness any issues with interference from competing radio signals, but my issues with the physical quality o"
2,Not a good one,I bought this product not knowing what I was getting into. I saw it was cheep. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! No matter where you where the sound quailty was VERY poor. Had to turn the volume all the way up on both MP3 and radio to hear a very mucical fuzz. Barley heard music over the fuzz.I also tried in the house thinking their was too much interferace outside in cars. I couldn't even hear a faint hint of the music that was playing. Plus all the cables is very iritating.Spend the extra money and pass this one on.
1,Don't Buy,"I'm not sure who these people are in Chicago and New Jersey stating that the thing even has moderate success.I'm about 15 miles south of Nashville TN. This item simply does not work unless, as others have stated, I'm holding it in my hand (using myself as an antennae) or have somehow managed to fix it just next to the car antennae. This is, of course, impossible unless you're using glue, tape, or something in your car as every bump and rattle distorts the sound and loses the signal.I dunno how other FM transmitter's fare but this one isn't worth any amount of money offered."
5,As advertised,Works as advertised. No blemishes and packaged as if it was new. Works and blends great. Only thing I had to do was adjust the mixer height so that the attachments came closer to the bowl which was easy to do. I think this is the best deal out there for a kitchenaid mixer.
1,Has broken 3 times,"My refurbished model broke after a year and has been non-functioning ever since. I paid $100+ to get it fixed and it broke again the first time I used it. I took it back, got it fixed again (the repair is under warranty) and it broke again the first time I tried to use it. The part that breaks is the gear housing and it takes a month to get the part. I would never buy Kitchenaid again. The company is not helpful on the phone and basically, after 18 months, I have an expensive boat anchor."
1,Incomplete Item,"Packaging was all banged, The lat's tower calbe was too short so there was no way of putting it together and the crossover arrived WITHOUT the weight.... A complete mess."
3,A step backwards for Garmin,"From the time you turn this unit you wonder what Garmin was thinking. Its hard to use, has a smaller screen than previous units (GPSMAP172C, for example), and the user manual is virtually useless...it doesn't even explain how to use many of the basic features. Also of note is the reduction in buttons which result in having to use too many sub-menus (by the time you figure out how to use the MOB feature the MOB will be a gonner). Way too complicated....took me hours to try to figure out how to use the features. On the plus side the screen is very bright even if the resolution is not the greatest (block letters are not as easy to read) and a good set of marine charts is standard. Its not all bad and it does do the job reasonably well, just a step backwards and very pricy. Garmin....you can do better!"
5,Garmin 440 GPS,"This GPS is exactly what I expected. It is perfect for a small boat application, simple to operate, clear screen with the features of larger more expensive units. Running my boat in the shallow backwaters is like playing a video game as far as navigation. Just keep the boat icon lined up over the right numbers and you have no worries. Fantastic product. Product arrived on time as stated in ad."
5,"Great Propaganda, Great Music","The reviewer from June 1999 hits it right on the button. For those of us growing up during WW2 EVERYTHING was propaganda. And, it certainly taught us how to look at news from Korea and Vietnam. I rated it 5-stars because it IS just what it was made to be."
4,Where is the DVD?,I have seen the video but refuse to buy it. I want to buy the DVD. When will it be made available? Please.......
2,Hopelessly Old Fashioned,"Once considered one of the greatest TV documentaries ever made, no one under the age of fifty is going to be able to sit through this overblown, hoaky collection of war footage. The narration is so overdramatic it's almost laughable, like the propaganda films made during the war to increase morale. Roger's score is great music, but it's just too prominant and often completely inappropriate (like the cheerfull flute music as Hitler marches into Paris).Skip this dinosaur and go directly to World at War, the great BBC series from the 1970s."
3,Concentrated ``Victory at Sea'' reveals some flaws,"The extravagant praise reaped by ``Victory at Sea'' in the early '50s turns out to have been overdone. But in 1952, it was not possible to watch all 26 episodes together. Now we can, and we see that the same film clips are used over and over -- obviously some of them misrepresenting themselves. Without source documentation, I cannot demonstrate it, but it appears some clips shown as from the early years were actually shot as late as 1945. Furthermore, the series glosses over Allied reverses. The ``Guadalcanal'' section is particularly bad in this respect. The explanation for the Marines' lack of equipment in the early days is simply dishonest. The Battle of Savo Island -- surely a pivotal event in the naval war -- is mentioned, quickly, in a list of other battles; but nothing is said of its significance. Great propaganda. Lousy history. Wonderful Richard Rogers score."
1,Another 5 Star Wow for Qaisra Shahraz,"Qaisra Shahraz, has once again wowed her readers with her second novel Typhoon and has become one of Britain's leading authors. Typhoon, although not a direct sequel to her previous novel: The Holy Woman, tells the gripping story of three women. Once again Qaisra Shahraz has taken some of the fascinating characters from her earlier book and developed them in a truly excellent way. One character in particular is the proud queen of the village Chaudharani Kaniz. She has become one of the most interesting characters in both books. We thought we knew her well in The Holy Woman it is not until Typhoon that we really understand this wonderful complex woman. Once again Qaisra Shahraz takes us on a wonderful exotic journey opening up the world of Pakistan to both the Western and Asian reader. You don't need to travel to that country because its heat and passion both spring out of the pages of these wonderful books."
1,Piece of junk.,"If I could give this no stars I would. Shoddy product construction. Hard to keep it at a consistent angle adjustment level. Just doesn't work well. Bought this to even out the bottom of some doors, it chewed up the wood, wouldn't stay at adjustment level. Don't buy this."
2,Mine didn't work.,"I saw another reviewer got a plane that he had to retool and rework to get good results from. I bought mine for one small project, and after struggling with this plane for a little while, I quickly gave up and used another approach instead. I've used other planes, and never had so much difficulty. I may get it back out and see if I can retool it to work better as the previous reviewer did, but reviewing it as the plane I received rather than one I had to repair after receiving, I can't give it more than two stars."
2,Good if you are a staunch whole language believer,"I picked up this book from a university bookstore because I was interested in background knowledge in linguistics to help guide reading instruction. This book is a typical ""we are right (whole language) and you are wrong (phonics)"" debate. The authors refer to themselves as ""sociopsycholinguists"" which I took to be the new term for whole language teachers. I don't want to waste my time reading about the whole language vs. phonics debate anymore, I just wanted the research and background provided by linguistic study. This book just seemed to be a rehashing of whole language theories; and why they are correct and the phonics approach is wrong with little classroom strategies (which is what I wanted from the book). I wanted different ways I could use to help struggling readers no matter what the theory, I don't feel this was a good book for that."
2,This is a textbook?,"Not really impressed with this book. It was a required text and I've been disappointed in it's content. When discussing the why we use sound to communicate, the best the authors could come up with is ""..to talk in the dark and to talk around corners."" The authors present stronger material in working with ELL students but weak on linguistics. As a textbook, this a bad choice as a teaching source. The up & coming ELL teachers should look for other material."
1,"If you like trivia, this is the book for you!","This was a required text for the graduate course I was taking on Linguistics. It is very poorly written. It is a small book full of trivia. I learned close to zero about a topic that I had a burning desire to learn about. There is a lot of nebulous advice about what not to do, but very little about what to do for students. Now I know the origin of the word ""sandwich."" This kernel of information will be great to talk about during the next happy hour that I attend! If you want to really learn about linguistics I would highly recommend linguistic books by the author Edward Finegan's book instead.Do yourself a favor and walk away...And please college professors, don't dumb down our courses by making graduate students read stuff like this... It's pathetic!"
3,Summary,"I was required to use this book for a class, and while some of the information was useful, parts of it were boring and really had no bearing on the class."
4,great book,"that was really nice trainnig methods once it not only teaches you word repetition but also works on the functional aspects of phonation - great for a Brazilian guy that had a hard time to learn how to ""untie"" his tongue to speak."
4,Great way to lose your accent...it takes a while.,I love the way they this program tries to reduce your accent. Is in a way efficient but requires a lot of tenuity.
5,An Excellent Work,"This is a complete and well rounded work. Eventhough I have been living in the US for over 17 years and earned an AS and a BS, I found myself having difficulties in the pronunciation of the english words. I have gotten a lot of helps from my kids, however after applying the American Accent Guide to my daily routines for a couple months, I have been feeling a lot more confident to express myself. The digital media is professionally prepared and the speakers are pleasant and very well articulated. I used the cds in my car and also ripped them into my mp3 player to listen to when I am excercising and riding with someone.The Accent guide has helped me to be more aware of the subtle nature of the English Language. If you would like to speak the American Idiom better and more fluently this is a great resource to have. It works!!!!"
3,Was not so good as it appears...,"This is a good book, but considering its price, I wouldn't buy it again."
2,you can improve your pronuciaton,I like ! I believe to improve pronunciations you do have to now vowel and how they are changing the pronunciations you see this book teaching for people spiking batter and have little problem with there pronunciations the way I see it. the tattle of this book is it is Pronunciation and Speaking Style of American English for Individuals of All Language .my point is we need the bathes not pronunciation the world will be voles those change every word you speaking ever word you want Wrightthank you
3,torn on this review,"perhaps it was my mistake - but the presentation of this product was misleading to me.i am used to ordering from hobby lobby and kirklands and such - and have ordered plants from amazon before - this was the first time i looked at apicture, loved something like this and hated it when i got it.....i dont know where to find that wood thing to make it look like the picture AND when it says stems - that is what you get - each flower stem thing is individually wrapped - all straight - and in a box - wish i could post a picture -i am just saying they should have posted the picture of what you get - then as an optional picture they should have posted the one with the nice wood thing - as ""what you can do wth this ""i was just dissappointed and to be honest it is all still in the box in a corner..... :("
1,Horrible,"I have less of a problem with the product itself than with orangeonions.com. The frame came to me with broken glass, and although I followed the proper refund procedure, I have now waited about two weeks and have heard nothing from them. I have sent multiple emails with no response and have called many times to only get never-ending ringing on the line. All I want is a refund! Very poor customer service."
2,gawdy gold,"This looked like a cute silver frame online. When I opened it, the frame itself had quite a bit of gold color and some silver coloring in grooves. It wasn't my style so I returned it."
5,"Kind, clear, and brilliant","Respected British psychoanalyst, teacher, writer Coltart would seem to be the best kind of practitioner: brilliant, kind, and utterly humane. She's been practicing since 1972. I love these essays because she is hopeful, helpful, and very wise. Her references are her clinical practice, art, philosophy, and literature. She reads, listens, and describes -- widely and well in these essays. Rarely, she lapses into jargon (rocky reading for the lay person), but usually avoids it. Some of her topics: wordlessness and the unthinkable;the silent patient and the meanings of silence (she isn't at all afraid of it); sin and conscience; the squaring of the practice of psychoanalysis with her chosen practice of Buddhism. Coltart reveals herself to be thoughtful and remarkably humane; open to the world, and at the same time disciplined and clear in her beliefs and goals. Wonderful reading and rereading."
2,Needed Longer Development,"For the budget this film was ok. Director Jimenez did as well as you'd expect with a script that, IMO, should have been re-worked a few more times. Not bad for the budget."
3,Synopsis,"THE STORY OF JOHN F. KENNEDY tells a story that will in a few years become a legend. But in 1964, it recalls vividly events that are still a part of the living memory of all. For John F. Kennedy walks in our thoughts today even though his life and works are now history.THE STORY OF JOHN F. KENNEDY, in relating his boyhood and youth, his schooling, his military and political service before becoming President, and his family life, makes clear why he can so aptly be described as ""the first statesman of the Space Age, symbol of hope for securing peace in a troubled world, and the champion of equal rights for all citizens."" It is a fitting memorial to the life and contributions of our recently martyred president."
3,Tips over too easy,I love RADIO FLYER - they are built to last and they stand behind their products and you never have any issues if you need a spare part... however I was disappointed with this tricycle. It tips over way too easy...we live on a cul de sac and just the part of the side walk that dips a little for the driveways makes it want to tip. Maybe its not a problem with an experienced trike rider but for my child its always a problem. I bought a big wheel instead and found its much easier to peddle... for a whimpy kid like mine :) Plus no problems with tipping.
4,Traditional Trike of yesteryear!,"This trike is great, we have two toddlers, one 3 years of age, one 5 years of age, both just getting into biking, and wearing a helmet. The bike is well made, and all the parts came with it, I did however, have trouble with the handle bar adjustment, and one tire was slightly bent but I took it to my local bike shop and it was a quick fix for $15 for both bikes, no big deal. The bike shop actually commented on how well made the bike was, and even thinking of selling them. the only drawback is the seat, it does drop to a lowest setting but my toddlers still have issues with reaching the pedals, I would say they will more than likely ""grow into these bikes"" for the next few years. Our 5 year old though is special needs and he was able to use the bike by sitting on it, and pushing with his feet. Overall, a great bike, a great find, speedy delivery, outstanding customer service, and no issues. Highly recommend it!"
5,Sturdy trike,"We bought this trike for our son because it was a little bigger than others we looked at. He is tall for his age and we wanted something that would last until he was ready for a two wheel bike. It is very sturdy (heavy) and reminds me of the trikes we had when we were little. My husband had no difficulty assembling it. It did have an odor to it when we opened the box, sort of a plastic or maybe paint smell. It went away quickly and wasn't a problem. Overall, it is sturdy, seems to be easy to pedal and my son loves it."
5,Just like I remember,"The tricycle was just like I remembered as a child. It was made just as well as it was back then. The bell sure brought back memories. This is the best 1st bike for any small child my 2 year old granddaughter loved it. The seat goes all the way down and back up as needed. I am very pleased with the quick shipping service. I couldn't find this in any store around here, but I know I got a great deal with free shipping on Amazon, probably better than at a store."
1,DANGERous Tricycle,I would never buy this trike again for a child. It tips VERY easily when the child's weight leans even the slightest bit forward or to the side. Enough said. Money wasted and damage done.
1,Too tippy for all ages,"This trike is too tall, and the front wheel is too small. The result is that it tips over VERY easily. I won't even let my two year old on it, because it falls over so easily. My 3 1/2 year old can ride it straight on a totally flat surface, but we live on a cul-de-sac that has a slight slant to it, and any time she tries to turn it at all she tips right over. Even the 4 year old boy next door falls down on this. It's so tippy that the neighbors won't let any of their kids ride it! Not only that, but the grippers on the handles come right off. I love Radio Flyer, and I certainly have fond memories of their products from when I was a kid, but I wish I had gotten a lower, wider, safer tricycle instead of this one."
2,Too tall topsy turvy,"This was a gift for our son when he was 2. There was no way he could reach the pedals. Age 3 -- not reaching. Age 4 -- not reaching. Age 4 and 1/2 he can reach, but he doesn't feel safe on it. Now he is almost 5 and is still afraid to ride it. Keep in mind, he is a little bit shorter than the average bear. Now he's afraid to try. It's too tipsy and will not take bumps well. He'd rather stand near it and ring the bell. Now we also have a 2-year-old girl and she wants to ride it, but I'm terrified that she would fall off. The seat is too small and has them perched so high that I'm afraid to even let them ride on it while I push.I think this should be for an older child with smooth sidewalks and no fear -- but that type of child probably would be bored with its lack of flexibility and poor turning capability.Why two stars? The looks, of course. It decorates the garage nicely."
4,Nice Trike,"This was a birthday present for my two year old. She was a little short to push the peddles all the way at first, but quickly grew into it. She is now almost three and has gotten a lot of use of this. It is sturdy (a bit heavy if tipped over-which it's hard to do), but does rust easily in humid weather, even when kept in a carport."
5,Fantastic Tricycle for the right size child!,"I recently bought this tricycle for my just-turned 3 year old son. He's a tall kid for his age being 40 inches tall, and the seat in its LOWEST position is a pefect fit for him. I would definately recommend the trike, it's built to last, has a nice retro look, and most importantly my son loves it, but please don't let the recommended age fool you. I'd go more by height than age on this one!!"
2,Not safe!,"This toy was bought by my parents to our 3-year old son. He's likes to look at it and play with the bell and streamers. However, It's not safe at all! Our son can't reach the pedals while turning even with the seat at the lowest setting. Like the other reviews I read we have the same problems with the handle bar. Also, even though my son knows how to ride it, the bike still tips over every once-in-a-while, unlike his playschool plastic trike. I think he has a new room decoration, but not recommended for riding."
4,Have your child try it before buying,"This was a gift to our son when he was only one. We didn't expect him to ride it then! But my husband put it together for his second birthday, with some minor difficulties with the handle bar, and we discovered he won't be riding it until he's about 5! He is short and there's no way he can adapt to the height of this trike. Definitely have your child test drive it first."
2,HORRIBLE!!!,My 3 year old can't reach the petals (she is considered tall for her age). She is also terrified to ride this horrible tricycle because it tips over! Nostaglia is about all it is good for!
3,"Honda Element 1, Tricycle 0","Like the other reviews, this trike is tippy. It is a great looking classic-style trike. Assembly wasn't too bad, but as others have said, you really need to tighten up the handlebars and seat well to keep it aligned. We bought it for our daughter's second birthday, and it really was too big for her. She was almost big enough this year (at 35 months) and would have been able to ride it if it hadn't lost a battle with our Honda Element (hence only one star for durability :p )."
4,cute tricycle,"We bought this tricycle for christmas for our 2.5 year old son. He is very tall for his age, this trike gives him some room to grow. I love how the bike looks, with the streamers, he loves the bell!The only negetive thing I could say is it does seems to tip over easily, I think my son does it on purpose... he loves to crash!I had a radioflyer tricycle when I was his age, I am sure it was my brothers before it was mine. These trikes last forever. I am very happy with the purchase. It is a great value, and a classic tricycle."
1,Beware peeling handlebars!,"My 2 1/2 year-old received this bike for Christmas. We all loved its retro look and it seemed pretty sturdy. He had only had it for a couple of days when we noticed he was peeling off the shiny metallic coating from the handlebars. His grandmother tried to brush away the loose flakes and received several substantial cuts on her fingers and hand. We got rid of the bike immediately! Also, while it says it is appropriate for ages 2 and up, his older brother was barely big enough to pedal it."
1,Tips over and bolts loosen,"I bought two of these for my twin daughters who are 4-1/2 now and they still have trouble riding them.The trike will topple over if the wheels are turned too sharply. The center of gravity is too high for small children. One of my daughters said she's rather just walk in the parade and wave a flag than learn how to ride it for the 4th of July parade. That's when I decided I need to get her a different trike if her experience has been that bad.Also, the bolts come loose and the wheel can turn without turning the steering wheel no matter how tightly the bolts are tightened. Same with the seat - it wiggles.The other daughter fell off the trike and the lever for the bell dug into her skin causing a bad scrape.It's pretty and the bell has a lot of nostalgia but it hasn't been practical at all. Trike riding should feel like a joy but with these, the kids think I'm giving them a chore when I say ""Let's go ride tricycles."""
2,Great named bike but a little dissapointed on the durability,"When purchasing this product, I thought that the brand Radio Flyer was a brand that I could depend on for durability since I was using this item in my preschool. I found that the bicycle that I purchased was not as sturdy as other bicycles that I have purchased in the past and the handle bars could not be tightened enough to keep them from moving, which prevents my 2-4 year olds from riding and turning the bike properly."
5,A good clasic toy.,"I am 57 years old. When I was a child ,I had one of this tricycle. I remember it as one of my best toys ever. I think that my grandson is going to enjoy it. The Red Dual Deck Tricycle is beautiful, I can see that it is strong and durable. I hope my grandson be as happy as I am with his new clasic Trycicle. I have the toy with me, until the Christmas day. I am ready with the camera to keep his face at the moment he receive the ""bike"" from Santa. My overall evaluation of this toy isthat it is "" EXCELLENT'."
1,DANGEROUS,I bought model #33 tricycle and it looks beautiful and is veryeasy to ride - my 2 year old son loves it. Unfortunately after1 hour of riding on it he fell of 3 times - so did my friendskids 3 and 2 year old boys. There is something completelywrong with its weight. When the front wheel is turned even alittle bit in one direction and the child bends forward inanother there are down on their faces.It looks so nice but this model is very dangerous andpractically unusable... Try model #36 - it looks safer with thechain drive.Anna (Mother of 27 month old and 7 month old)
2,Dangerous and poorly made,"I purchased this tricycle for my 2 year old son-he is 4 now. What a mistake! The bike tips over very easily when turning and it's very hard to tell a 2 year old to slow down when he's trying to have fun. Even in slow speed turns you can see the inside back tire start to lift.With a 2 year old, riding the tricycle occasionally, all the tread wore off the front tire in 6 months and I have not found anyone who sells replacement tires.Although I grew up with Radio Flyer's back in the 60's, and they were made very well back then, I have to say I would never buy a Radio Flyer product again."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"We purchased this bike for our two and a half year old son, since it's age reccomendation was for 24 months through 5 years. He could not reach the pedals, let alone the ground (and he is in the 75% for his height) and he was constantly falling over on it. Also, the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire, so it was always turned sideways to make the bike go straight. My neighbor also has this bike and hers does the same thing. Finally, after about five months of my four year old riding it, the front tire has just completely broke off of the frame!! We are very disappointed in the stability and quality of this bike. It looks cute, but don't be fooled. It is very top/front heavy and is always falling over when you make a turn. Don't buy it!!!"
5,grandkids love it,"We bought this for one of grand'son's 2nd birthday and had it shipped directly to his house. it arrived as promised, our son put it together and didn't report any problems. We've been told that both our grandsons (2 & 5 yr olds) have been riding it and loving it.Can't comment on actual quality but it delivers the fun it promised."
5,Sturdy Tricycle,"Kids love it, sturdy, lives outside rain and shine looks great. I stand on the back and push the kids around. Good bike to learn how to peddle."
4,Great Tricycle!,"I bought this Radio Flyer Tricycle for my 3-year-old grandson, and it is durable and sturdy. I purchased it online because I saved a few dollars by doing so. However, when I received the item in the mail, the packaging was torn and re-taped. I think our local UPS delivery people are lax in their delivery methods. The contents weren't damaged or missing, and I would purchase from Amazon again."
1,Terrible to put together,"I ordered this bike as the main present for my four year old's birthday. Imagine the disappointment when we could not sufficiently tighten the bolt that attaches the handlebars to the front wheel, so the handlebars turn independently from the wheel (making the bike unusable). We called the manufacturer and they sent us a new part--we replaced it and it did not solve the problem. Now they are sending us a different part. Meanwhile, my daughter is still without a bike."
3,My daughter loved it from day 1 but...,I have to agree with the previous comments about tipping. My daughter has fallen off a few times. It will tip on quick turns. The only other con is it rusts very easy. We always bring it in the house at night to avoid exposure to the humidity. I purchased it for my daughter when she was 2 1/2 and she had no problem reaching the pedals. My 19 month old also loves to try and ride but she has more difficulty reaching. If you're going to by this trike it will need special care in terms of maintenance but your kids will love it!
2,quality lacking,"I worked in bicycle shops for years and assembled many tricycles. I purchased this one for my 2.5-year-old daughter because she saw one at the hardware store and loved it. The trike has the classic Radio Flyer look, which is great, and its steel construction gives it some heft and the appearance of durability.But there are problems. The pedal/crank/front fork assembly relies on a cheap plastic casing to hold these critical pieces together (every time the child pedals the trike, all of these parts are under stress). The casing fell out on one side almost right away, leaving the crank separated from the fork. Trying to lightly tap it back into place with a hammer proved unsuccessful. Also, the handlebar/headtube assembly relies on a nut-and-bolt configuration that even under repeated tightening was unable to hold the handlebar securely in the headtube. this, of course, is maddening to both adult and child when handlebars are constantly out of alignment.Buy with caution."
2,tips over easily -- very dangerous and frustrating,"We bought this Radio Flyer Tricycle for my now five year old when she was two. It tips over horribly. The front will ""jack-knife"" and then it tips over. She refused to ride it until she was older, even though she could reach the pedals with no problem. She just got tired of tipping over and crashing. When she was three, it seemed to work better for her and not tip quite as much. We kept it because it is so cute and reminiscent of the old days. Now, our 2nd daughter is two and we are going through the tip-overs all over again. It's very unsafe and frustrating for both child and parent. We are going to sell it in a yardsale and buy another brand that has better reviews and is not known to tip so easily. Radio-Flyer, you need to do a little work on this one to make it safer for this era."
5,Great for 3 yr old!,We bought this for our 3 yr old granddaughter and her 2 younger brothers. It is a little hard for her to pedal right now but she does do a good job on a concrete pad. I think the smaller one would have been too small. We bought this knowing it would be able to stand up and last through the 2 boys to follow. It is well made and great looking. We are looking forward to watching all 3 of them enjoy this trike! It was very easy to put together.
4,Very nice,Classic looking trike for our 3 year old; he got on right away and pedaled through the house as soon as he got it. The only downside is getting the handlebars attached so that it turns the front wheel properly. Had to get worlds strongest man to tighten (worried that we were going to strip the bolt).
3,"Nice,but not for 3 year olds.","Despite the fact that the recommended ages is for 2-5 year olds,this bike was too big for my 3 year old daughter.Her feet couldn't reach the pedels.I do like the quality of the bike and I'm sure she'll love it in about a year or so."
3,"parts in box, bent when arrived","Front fender dented, no big deal should still work fine. Then got to rear wheels,pole that goes through wheels was bent causing a squeak, nothing I thought wd40 could not fix, but after allowing grandson to ride for a while I noticed the rear wheels coming out of round and appears to wobble. Grandson does not care but I wonder how long it will still be rideable."
4,EXCELLENT CRAFTMANSHIP,My son is now three going on four and still rides his tricycle. This will be kept in our family for future generations to come.Cons: I did note that the price went down after I bought it.
2,Radio Flyer is not what it used to be,"It's a cute toy and has all the impressions of the classic but built like a Shenzhen knock-off. Even if you didn't see the made in China sticker you can tell these are not made in Chicago any more.So disappointed with the fit and finish of this, I feel like I'd rather make this from scratch for my child than to have purchased it.The kid loves it, and will have a great time but the engineer in me know it could be better and feel that Radio Flyer is phoning it in.I'm honestly ashamed I gave them money for this. Does the product work? Sure. Will the kid have fun? Sure. Could this be built in America at a competitive price? I have to believe it can."
5,My nephew loves his new bike,I bought this for my 2.5 year old nephew. Easy enough to put together and great instructions. Great quality and looks exactly like the picture.
3,Decent bike for the $$,"The handle bars keep coming loose, making it hard to steer. But, overall it's a great bike, and I'm sure it will last through several kids!"
1,HATE THIS BIKE--UNSAFE,"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was about 2. She loved all things red, so it seemed to be the perfect gift. However, when kids try to turn, it flips over! I thought it was just my daughter trying to turn too sharp, but my son has flipped it nearly every time he has tried it as well. THe neighborhood kids have flipped it over as well, resulting in many scraped hands and knees but luckily no heads. I AM THROWING IT AWAY!"
2,Cute But Hazardous,My Mother bought this bike for my 2 year old son as a big brother gift when we had our second child. We had it for a couple of weeks and he drove around in the house fine. But when we took it out on the sidewalk it kept toppling over if he hit an uneven part on the sidewalk. So we took it to the park to a very flat section and he kept falling over. Even a 3 year old friend kept falling over and getting hurt. I took the bike back the next day. Yes the bike is as cute as can be but be careful.. wear a helmet and pads!
2,They don't make them like they used to!,"We were so excited to buy this bike for our 2 year old. We figured Radioflyer is a well known brand which has been around for over 70 years; however, now the bike is not made with quality American standards. It's made in China. The bike has a noxious odor which is so strong that I fear it may be carcinogenic to our kids' precious lungs and bodies. The bike is not very constructed and tips over easily. Now it will be a cumbersome task to return this product that we tediously assembled. More disappointing, this toy purchase was a ""tease"" to our child who was so excited have his first ""real"" bike.I guess, the search will go on. :( Buyers beware when buying ANY products for your kids. Nowadays, company profit supersedes children's well-being."
1,"The bike is great, but too big!!!","We bought these bikes for our 2 y/o son and 3 y/o daughter for Christmas. While they look great and are very sturdy, they are just too darned big for a little toddler. Even now 9 months later they still cannot sit on the seat and reach the pedals. By the time they will be able to reach teh pedals they will be ready for a two wheeler. My kids are not tiny either, my daughter is 50 percentile and my son is 90 percentile. Get a smaller tricycle so your kids can ride it. We have a Planet Kiddo hand me down (made in Germany) that is much smaller and my daughter rides that around.Edited to add: Now, when my kids are 4 and 3, they still cannot reach the pedals. I am going to get coaster bikes for them that can have pedals added later. What a waste of money these tricycles were. It only gets ons start b/c I could not put zero stars..."
4,The tricycles,I bought the tricycles for our grand childern. They were very easy to put together. The childern really like them. I am sure they will get lots of use .
1,Rusts Easily--Watch Out,"My husband bought this for our two year old son... and it was just too big for him to use. So, we thought we'd wait. We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust. Once it started, the rust couldn't stop. So basically, a big waste of money.Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler."
3,"Built like a tank, but for BIG kids","We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down, he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger, he was able to ride more successfully, but I would say still not comfortably. Also, getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike, IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!"
1,Durable but don't turn!,"My son received this bike for his 3rd birthday from his grandparents. We loved it's looks. When the weather broke we took it outside and we were ready for some fun. Well everytime my son turned the bike fell over. When you turn it cuts too sharp and the bike tips over. After three times of getting hurt that was it and he will not ride the bike now. We thought maybe he was too young so we let our neighbors son ride, he is four he also fell twice and will not ride. Last but not least we let a 5 year old try she also fell twice and that was it for her. They look at the bike as if to say, ""I'm not riding that bike."" So now it sits in our garage. I will say though it is a beautiful bike just not made to turn."
1,Heed the warnings--don't buy this trike,"I didn't heed the warnings, because some people gave this trike 5 stars and some gave it 1, with little middle ground. I loved the looks of the tricycle so much I decided to listen to the 5-star people. I wish I hadn't. My son is almost 3, and he's 40 inches tall and weighs 39 pounds, so he's not a tiny guy. He's learned he'd better not turn the handlebar very fast or he'll tip over. He's learned he'd better not pedal very fast or he'll tip over. I've learned I'd better be ready to grab him at any moment or he'll be tangled up on the ground with a tricycle on top of him. The center of gravity in this trike is WAY too high and is dangerous. I suppose it must work better for bigger kids (i.e. 5 and up), but definitely not for its intended users, ages 3 and 4. His little Roadmaster tricycle we bought at a garage sale is way better, because it won't tip over no matter what he does.Trikes should be made to go fast and be stable, and this one does not fit the bill."
5,great all some and then some,"the best trcycle for a small kid,my kids loves it.very well made for the money,which the money was will spent"
3,Not meant for a first trike,"By the time your child can menouver this heavy, tall trike they should have a 2 wheel bike. Not a first trike. It is good quality but I agree with the other users with having to find a way to stablize the handlebars to keep them from turning. The white walled tires weren't painted within the lines very well but it does look nice. Just waiting for my daughter to grow tall enough to enjoy it."
4,All things considered,"I have been wearing CK traditional fit boxers for well over a decade so my review will obviously be somewhat biased. These recently discontinued U1050 boxers are well made and very comfortable. The poplin material is the strongest point to these boxers - smoother feel than the woven and breathes more than adequately. The open fly is always a preference and the tailoring is near perfect. The only less-than-great aspect of these shorts is the gathered waistband. Now, if Calvin Klein could incorporate the poplin boxer with the standard CK waistband, that would be the ultimate. All things considered though, the U1050 are first class."
1,Women hate boxers,"The previous reviewer is right. Women love to see a man in a thong and not in boxers. Afther I first put a thong on my wife has not stopped telling me how sexy I look.It has converted her in a nifomaniac! If you want great sex, get a thong. Your woman will love it."
2,Mad movie,"A lot of movie packed into this; a mix of italian politics, religion and fascism. Misses the eroticism, though. The title is a bit mis-leading."
3,cute excursion into soft porn,Not a record maker but fun to watch and was glad to add to some like films from the 70's and 80;s
3,Dark night of the soul for the Evil Godfather of Britpop.,"This was the Auteurs third album, and was cynical even by their standards. Singer Luke Haines was wheelchair bound at the time, and certainly took no prisoners with his sneering verbal assault on anything and everything.In true nihilistic style, grim subjects such as aircraft disasters and child murders are discussed to the background of a more brittle sound than previous albums. However, this does not have the same songwriting quality of the classic first album 'New Wave', and is probably too dark for many. It's a patchy affair, but 'Light Aircraft on Fire', 'Land Lovers' and 'Unsolved Child Murder' (the latter track sounding like the Beatles if they'd been PURE MALEVOLENT EVIL) are absolutely classic tracks. It's worth checking out Luke Haines' new band 'Black Box Recorder' as well if you're into this."
4,A solid introduction to American history..,This book gives a good basic view of the history of the United States. It is interestingly written and gives a lot of little known detail. It makes a good read.
5,Fascinating history of America!,"Excellent account of the colonists who came to America and subsequent events. Unlike many history texts that focus mostly on ""places and dates"", this book covers the trends and, for lack of a better term, ""the big picture"". It begins with an account of what kind of people emigrated to America and which ""old world"" countries they left and why. While I count myself as an avid reader (and student) of history, especially American; this book has elucidated the background of some developments which I had never before understood as clearly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about American History."
3,Let s you know,"Some very interesting things are listed in here. I did enjoy it reading aloud to my friend. On parts of immigration, it showed how the young America was made up."
1,This book was a terrible dissappointment!,"The author includes hundreds of lame work along type exercises which don't explain how flash works. Also, many very important topics are not fully covered such as how to execute a movie from a button. And some of the examples like how to create a drop down menu don't even work! Every time I was trying to implement a new component of flash, I ended up searching the internet flash resourse directories for the answers because the book just didn't contain any! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,this book was terrible,"I tend to think that the people who have been writing great reviews about this book are friends of the author or maybe the author himself. This is the worst book on Flash I have ever read. The examples are horrible - it seems as though the author does not have much experience himself with Flash so he could not include many good examples. If you want to purchase a great book on Flash get 'Flash 4 Creative Web Animation' or the 'Flash 4 Bible', both excelent books.Steve"
3,"Great for Beginners, not for advanced","I was very excited when I ordered this book. I was disappointed in the end though. It is well written, easy to follow and walks you through exercises that will teach you how to use flash and understand digital image formats. As with all Flash4 books the scripting lessons (what I really wanted ) were basic. I have been using Flash for years and I did pick up some tips, but didn't really learn anything new. I would give this book to anyone just starting to learn Flash."
3,Not for Beginners,"Since I'm new to Flash, this book helped somewhat, but really blew by a lot of steps. It's great if you know a lot about Flash. But it moves so fast. Way too fast for a beginner. I liked the CD and the samples. Overall, it's a good book and merits the reviews so far. But if you are a beginner like I was (and still am) this book leaves you wanting something a bit simpler."
3,"Not too bad, but&#65533;","The main problem with this book is the too much unnecessary blah-blah, therefore I can imagine how difficult could be for Mohler's sutudents at Purdue University to get thru this theoretical jungle. If you really want to learn how Flash works I recommend for begginners the Visual ""Quickstart Guide for Flash"" by Katherine Ullrich, she shows us how we can simply learn Flash without going to Purdue. For intermediates ""Flash Web Design"" by Hillman Curtis. With transparent examples, comprehensive words, Curtis takes you to the point and explains the whats, hows and whys of the action scriptings with a logical approach step by step, nevertheless I wish Curtis would grant us in the future a deeper look inside this subject."
4,Don't judge this book by its cover,"Don't judge this book by its cover, even do it's one of the worst in its kind. I read many Flash books trying to learn more about ActionScripting not just how to edit a color or adding links. For that purpose it became an excellent source of information, with guided examples for the non-expert but neither dummy"
2,Eh...,"To be honest, about half-way through I almost turned it off-I kinda wish I did, but in the end, I'm glad I did not. The movie reminds all of us of a simple truth: how falling in love feels new every time, despite the painful past experiences one may have had with it. If you're an avid movie watcher, you'll be disappointed. I say skip it, and watch others, such as ""Loving Annabelle,"" or ""I can't think straight."" They are so much better."
5,add this gem to your collection,"it could be that the music found within these nine tracks reminded me of several others as have been mentioned such as Lanterna, but I also detected a bit of Do May Say Think, Silver Mount Zion, and Explosions in the Sky (albeit a bit more tranquil, in most respects the skill and talent is nonetheless there). Every track is good, n'uff said."
3,EP masking as full length,"These type of post-rock progressions/repetitions work best when elaborated in intricate melodic flux, or just broken down as purely as possible. The 6P7 knows and begins to work with these former dynamics quite well, though it only comes together seamlessly briefly, as in the title track. Between underdeveloped tracks and dawdling fade-outs the debut misses the mark of becoming a must have even with some gorgeous material."
3,Not What I Hoped For,This is made for couples throughout all the cds. I was hoping there would have been more for dancing alone.
4,Jamaican Jazz Saxophone played by one of its best.,A track from this album featured on Rebirth of Cool 7 (African Elation) lead me into buying this very good album from one of Jamaica's foremost sax players. The guest musicians are excellent and the selection includes Fraser's own compositions and compositions from other Jamaican legends. The sound flows naturally as if all musicians knew each other for a long time. Recommended.
4,Good read,"Continued the stories of recurring characters, I like these type of stories. I have reqd several of Kathryn Shay`s books and enjoy them."
1,Nothing Left to Lose and Nowhere to Go But Up,"This book is a major disaster. I was so disappointed because I have had pretty good luck with Amazon reviews but this was just awful. It is terribly written, the plot is hopeless and and completely silly; what more can I say. I couldn't even finish it and I really tried."
5,Van Morrion songs on movie soundtracks,"I don't know if this will help, but Van Morrison sang ""These are the Days"" on the Nine Months soundtrack. Also, my favorite from a soundtrack is ""Into the Mystic"" (found on Moondance) from the movie Immediate Family."
4,Rare gem,"Well I gotta say, I've been looking for the streetfighter album for the longest time. The quality is really good and if your a huge fan of Frankie Valli like I am, then this will be a nice addition to your collection. Hope & glory was not to bad if you are a fan of the early 90s pop/dance sound, but I mainly got this for streetfighter. Very nice :)"
4,Streetfighter was overlooked,"Well, I decided to go for it, having recently bought the older stuff from the 60's. I can't stop playing the song Streetfighter...and what a song perfect for radio play, surprising that it never made the radio, but hey from what I hear, radio and the decision makers dismissed the 4 seasons in the 80's and not until recent vote by fans have they even noticed. The Streetfighter song was grossely overlooked by radio and Hope and Glory, while most not real radio play, has fantastic vocal arrangements and Even Now is a hit waiting to happen. Why the record company doesn't take some of these and promote some as radio play, even today, maybe add a few beats is beyond me, especially witrh how populare Valli is today. I highly recomend. 4 stars, not 5 because the song material, while vocally superior, the words were not as high quality as expected from the Seasons. Hey they set their own bar and it is very high."
3,Not good Four Season representations,"In the 1960s, the Four Seasons were young with happy, pop music.In the 1970s, the Four Seasons ""grew up"" and recorded more heartfelt music.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Four Seasons experimented with cliche 1980s sounds and couldn't quite come up with something as catchy as they did during their heyday.It is always a treat to have any ""new"" Four Seasons material re-released. I was totally excited to get this product, but learned that the releases were really flawed and not typical Seasons releases.I love their pop sound, but with these albums it seems like are trying too hard to be ""hip"" with the synthesizer crowd and not really coming off like the legends they are. Anyone could have recorded an album during the 80s and released this. That is what is sad. The Seasons were always so unique, but these albums don't really say much for them.Any release by the Seasons must get at least 3 stars, and this one is barely scrapes even that."
1,Paperweight,"This book is filled with photographed portraits of rich and famous people from 50-80 years ago. Most are dead now, and anyone under the age of 45 would barely recall only a few of them. The portrait photos are strangely lit and poorly posed, with an emphasis on presenting the subjects as ugly as possible. Maybe Karsh was attempting to make them seem more realistic and down-to-earth, but I felt this was more of an insult to those who time would soon forget.I received this book by accident when I ordered a different title entirely, so after looking this one over, I decided that it wasn't worth keeping or reselling (the going price for this oversized, overweight, coffee-table crowder is only $4.95 used). I tossed it in the trash, even though I dislike throwing any book away."
4,Another Great Canon,"I purchased this camera in an upgrade to my G1. Main differences are more megapixels, a longer zoom, and longer movie clips. Love both cameras.Pros:I have been totally happy for around 6,000 pictures.Far exceeds my expectations for a point and shoot.Takes far better pics than my brothers Nikon for 1/2 the $$.Colors are true a brilliant.Indoor flash pics are great.Focus is spot-on.Usability is great in most all situations.Manual options are excellent.Articulating viewing LCD is outstanding.Battery life is wonderful.Cons:Video locks up unless I use a smaller high speed CF card.Lens feels a bit 'loose'.Kinda slow between shots."
5,Upgraded from G2 and not looking back!,"The Powershot G3 is a great camera. Why? Because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos! 4 Megapixels is plenty for all but pros, and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera. It's slightly lighter than the G2 and packed with even more features. Make sure you get a big CompactFlash card (it comes with a 32MB) -- the 512MB cards are pretty [inexpensive] here on Amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time!"
4,Haven't had practice but I'm already in love with it,"I have only had this camera for one full day and I have to say that it is wonderful. the photo quality is amazing and i know i'm going to have fun with all the features. I've figured out most of its features on my own already (because i have used digital cameras before, so i know things like symbols). i'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top, but that doesn't stop me from loving this camera. the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can't get an accurate adjustment (for those of you who don't know what a diopter adjustment is, it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight.) I am going to have so much fun with this camera and when I learn more I will post a more accurate review."
5,Canon G3 Review/Response/Recommendation,"The camera's a work of art/science -- that's understood. It takes great pictures, operates quickly, and feels solid.To address two previous somewhat negative reviews:(1) Yes, the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder; however, the LCD viewfinder is rather stunning and I find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder.(2) There are, actually, several differences between the G2 and G3, such as differences in Continuous Shooting, the Optical Lens, the Control Layout, Playback Zoom, Image Processing, and so on. ..."
2,Could have been much better,"Packed with features this camera could have been much,much better. Unfortunately the autofocus is often terribly slow and inaccurate. Low light focus is downright poor. I have cheaper and older digital cameras that perform better in focusing. A manual focus feature would have saved me a lot of shots. Another surprise: you can clearly see a significant portion of the top of the lens cover through the optical viewfinder window."
2,"LOVE THE G2, HATE THE G3",I LOVE MY G2 SO THOUGHT I WOULD UPGRADE. BIG MISTAKE. THE G3 HAD PROBLEMS FOCUSING IN LOW LIGHT AND WOULD NOT TAKE THE PICTURE WHEN THE SHUTTER WAS PRESSED BUT AFTER THE SHUTTER HAD BEEN RELEASED A FEW SECONDS. GOT WAY TOO MANY BLURRY PICTURES. I HAVE RETURNED THE G3 (ACTUALLY I TRIED TWO OF THEM) AND HAVE MY G2!
4,G3 PowerShot Review,Excellent camera. Used in an orthodontic office to take intraoral dental photos as well as facial photos. Easy to use. Good quality images.
5,This is a great camera!,"I bought my G3 in September of 2003 after my SLR took a dump 3 weeks before my baby was due. I have NEVER been disappointed. Granted, if I had the money, I would have gone for something better, but this was the BEST I could have gotten for my money. Some reviewers have commented on the camera not being worth the price - you must not have shopped around! I found mine, brand new, for $460 from a reputable online camera store.My pictures turn out great most of the time. I agree with the slow focus time, but you can't get everything with a prosumer camera. I love the neverending list of options this camera offers (from flash output to f-stops to white balance, etc. etc.).When I have the money saved up I'll be buying the Canon digital rebel, but until then I am very satisfied with my G3."
4,Fabio Fitness Video,At my summer home we are using this video during our weight training three days a week. When I return to my winter home I want to continue with my training so I bought this video so I could keep up with the training. This video is a good work out for the whole body.
4,The World's Sexiest Man,"When Fabio's workout partner, the lovely Brenda Dygraaf, announced that the video would not contain any ""confusing choreographed moves,"" I knew it would be a winner.Fabio keeps it simple - working the back, chest, biceps, triceps,legs and abs with very basic moves.You'd think with Fabio as the host, the cheese factor would be high, but it's not. Fabio does make love to the camera throughout the workout, and he does remind viewers of just how sexy they'll look if they stick to his workout, and the tape is peppered with shots of Fabio working out shirtless on a rooftop, but that's as far as it goes.Fabio is a very likeable host. His extremely chipper workout partner and co-host, Brenda, might become bothersome to those of you who have a low tolerance for happiness, but any friend of Fabio's is a friend of mine!"
4,Premier Collection a hit,"Loved this c.d.Streisand's rendition of MEMORY has always been my favorite version of the song outside of the show...Betty Buckley's is my favorite within the show. I am a Streisand afficiando, and this is my FAVORITE Streisand song period..so it must be good...Michael Ball singing anything is wonderful...It captures the wonderful feeling of being on a cloud when you listen to this album"
3,"Good, but. . . . .","This CD was very good, but I only give it 3. The Collection holds a lot of Webber's Best, but my favourites were: Jellicle Ball Any Dream Will Do MemoryThose highlight the collection, along with Amigos para Siempre.Anyway, get the CD, buy it or get it from the Library, it is well worth listening to!"
2,Sub-par Sound,"Having grown up in NYC and having seem many of Andrew Lloyd Weber's musicals on Broadway, this collection was a happy trip down memory lane. The selection of songs and performers like Sarah Brighman, Michael Ball and Barbara Streisand were great (although I would have preferred the original cast performing them). However, the quality of the sound was terrible. Most of the songs sounded as though they were sung through a tunnel and/or had a tin-like quality. This is a shame and not acceptable in this day of technical and digital advance. The quality of the sound does not do justice to the quality of the works nor the talented singers performing them.If you are an ALW fan or just want to hear some great soundtracks, I would not recommend getting this CD."
2,BU..........,"IF you wanna watch Judas Priest in their ""hair metal"" days, this is the right video for you...."
3,could have been better,"When it comes to concert videos, I'm very picky. I like the ones that show everything as it actually happens. That's not the case with Judas Priest Live. Too much jumping around the show, playing one song, but showing scenes from a different song. It's filmed kind of like Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound Of Thunder video. Too many slow-motion shots. I think concert videos should seem more real. For example: Judas Priest Live In Memphis 1983. If Judas Priest Live was filmed that way, it would be perfect. I'd give it 7 or 8 stars. By the way, does anyone know if they'll ever release a live video for the Irvine Meadows concert from the Painkiller tour? They obviously filmed it."
2,Not worth it!,"Priest Fans, don't bother. It's on the TURBO tour. Nothing new and bad hair. It's the cheesiest Priest footage ever made. Glenn Tipton looks like he's trying to be in Poison. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Dark days,"Being Judas so good and so great, it's almos impossible to give less than three stars. But this video deserved so, because it's the horrible ""TURBO"" tour, the band is dressed like Poison or Dokken or Ratt, the performance is precise but cold, impersonal. The video for the ""SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE"" tour is much better."
3,"Good, but not THAT good","I like Earth Crisis. They got me into the whole Straight-Edge scene. But this CD is lacking something. It is raw and powerful, but at the same time it seems almost too raw, to the point of unmotivated. Their message is powerful and aspirative, and it's very apparent in this release. But the music just leaves something to be desired. Good if you like the message, average if you like the music."
5,Earth Crisis Debut,"This is a must have for any Earth Crisis fan. It is their debut recording, and in the tradition of first release/demos, it has a very simple production and lots of minor mishaps in the recording. More importantly, this delivers, head on and in your face, the Earth Crisis message of fighting for innocent life."
5,the essence of hardcore,"this is a great cd, the first release from a great band. this is what hardcore is about, raw and straight from the heart. there is a lot of energy and emotion here. being their earliest recording available on cd, it isn't over produced and all fancy...it is just straight up hardcore. sXe forever."
3,ALL OUT WAR,"Early earth crisis. Bad sound quality. Good songs. Last track from breed the killers on here, oldstylez"
1,Have any of u heard this cd?,"People worship Earth Crisis for two reasons.1. They're not ""mainstream""2. They promote veganismPeople who worship Earth Crisis have at least these two traits.1. They're rich and in mid teens2. They think it's a sin to be succesful (like mainstream pop bands)People who give these guys five star reviews either have never heard this CD, or they don't care about how awful the music sounds. There is nothing in this CD to appeal to your ears. It's raw and devoid of talent.--Ozzy"
5,Cactus Juice Eco-Safe Spray,"Cactus Juice is a non greasy spray with a non offensive, almost pleasant smell. Most importantly: It works!My husband & I often like to relax outside on our backyard patio with a cool beverage during Summer afternoons and early evenings to take in the garden views, the fresh air, and watch the bird activity around our woodland water feature until the sun goes down. Unfortunately, mosquitoes and other flying insects would become bothersome which detracted from our otherwise enjoyable time so I researched various products & decided upon Cactus Juice as an eco-safe alternative to other insect repellants on the market. We find, to our relief and delight, that a light spray application rubbed onto exposed skin areas is all it takes to keep those pesky critters at bay for hours."
4,works better than other bug spray,"We first purchased Cactus bug spray in the Caribbean, it works better than the normal spray. So glad we were able to find it in US. Smells nice too :)"
1,Very poor shipping - bag full of Cactus Juice,"After a lot of confusion and a changed shipping arrival date by Amazon, the product did arrive within the specified time frame. Five bottles of Cactus Juice were placed in a plastic bag that was put in a box with no material to protect it. When I opened the box the plastic bag was full of Cactus Juice! Not only is this a mess for me to clean up, I will not have five full bottles of this product. I would not order from this vendor again. I have used this product in the past (a friend had some) and it works very well to keep the flies at the Delaware Beaches from stinging."
5,The 3rd time Around,"DJ Garth of Grayhound Recordings makes sort of a guest appearance for Om Records to create this delicious eclectic mix. The third installment of the successful San Francisco Sessions and a great follow-up at that. Garth, co-founder of the Wicked Crew, starts the ""journey"" off with some perfect downtempo reggae and eleganty mixes in some great dub infested house tracks. Although he uses simple fading techniques, the track selection is brilliant. Most are dubbed tracks but that only enhances the great eclectic atmosphere he has set in store for listeners. They work very well together and show a noticable slow change. The house first starts off with some great, jazzy dubbed out tracks and so slowly merges into some great tribal house. Then finishes off with a great work by Santal in ""Past and Future Things"". Overall, this is one trippy dubbed out mix that can only be done by DJ Garth. Put this into your CD player and experience it to the fullest."
4,"West coast House ""in the house""","This is a real funky house CD. The beats are tight and deep enough to boom the speakers in your jeep. This sounds very much like the house sound of the west coast ie: Doc Martin. If you like house music with some kick and a light latin flavor then this will do nicely. ""Burnin"" and ""Dave on Guitar"" are two of my favorites on this CD. The mixing is good and the variety is wide, not just straight house from start to finish. A nice addition to any house music collection."
4,In the spirit,"Great hardcore album, im the spirit of open E based riffage. Some exceptional songs on there also."
3,dissapointed,"i'm really quite dissapointed in this cd. i use to love strife, then stopped listening to them, then got back into hardcore. this cd is more metal than hardcore . . . its not bad, but its not as good as there other stuff. . . music style is similar to pantera now . . . i think thats a bad think, you may think its a good thing though."
5,"It is the original primal essence of ""Tricky""","This is like touching the hand of old friend, it leads you down a road where you slip into some kind of funky-wonderful. The blend is nearly perfect, beacuse it mixes the pungent flavor of old jazz tunes with down right blusey moods and stereophonic bouquets of wonderful artists. I felt a bit '80's nostalgic hearing Neneh Cherry and Allison Moyet, just to name a few. Tricky seems to bring the best out of everyone featured on the CD. I would like to see this expression explored more. I miss the part of him that taps into the endearing nature of primal exotica. It is a CD that is well worth the listen."
5,"moody , contemplative and, of course, trippy","Nearly God is technically a collective of artists, but Tricky is clearly in the driver's seat. Some of these songs are rather gloomy while others are more carefree. I've been told this is a great album to meditate to and I believe it. Especially with the mesmerizing ""Poems."" Also ""Tattoo"" is a deeply atmospheric track and I was thrilled to find out that it was written by one of my favorite groups - Siouxsie and the Banshees. Bjork and Tricky make an intriguing vocal duo, especially on ""Keep Your Mouth Shut"" which sounds like a dungeon until the opiate-haze interlude sung by Bjork. It's quite disconcerting when a brutal segment from a rap song cuts through the song, yet effective. Nearly God contains many strange sounds and great vocal performances. This is essential chill-out Tricky."
4,Nearly heaven,The opening track is a cover of ''Tattoo'' of the band Siouxsie & The Banshees. It's really effective. All the songs are in the same toxic mood.The collaborations with various singers like Bjork add a plus to the album.Maxinquaye was a must : this one is a great part II.
5,Ack....I'M MELTING,"Ok, I'll be honest, I didn't love this cd right away. I had to listen to it a couple of times - but oh baby, when it hits you, watch out! The song ""Poems"" makes me want to cry really hard, but not in a sad way - it's just so cathartic. The whole album gets under your skin and you can't (nor do you want to) get it out! I loved hearing from Allison Moyet and Terry Hall. What a nostalgic trip. This is actually the first Tricky cd I've gotten. Everyone seems to be saying it's a real departure from his other albums. I plan to buy them all now. I only hope they will live up to the genius that is ""Nearly God"". Buy this!!!"
3,dont believe the hype,The most hyped album of the year. The first time I heard this it put me to sleep. Too much dissonance to enjoy. Nice concept but these guys could mix in some harmony or great tunes every now and then.
3,If It Weren't for Bjork...,". . .I probably would've given his album only two stars. Any album that features Bjork, however, automatically gets an extra star. I'm an avowed trip hop fan and have liked Tricky's work before, but this album surprised me with its unapproachability. After multiple listens, the grooves do become smoother and more listenable. Still, the depression remains rough and the pathos rather abstract. It is more ""experimental"" than more traditional trip hop albums, but this doesn't necessarily make for better listening, or even make the album more interesting and intellectually stimulating. If you like trip hop, go for other Tricky albums first-- any of them, in fact. If you're just getting into trip hop, head for Morcheeba, Supreme Beings of Leisure, Groove Armada or Portishead. This is an album that only serious Tricky enthusiasts need to own."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"This is the PERFECT under makeup moisturizer/blemish control!I recommend it, even if you don't have a blemish problems!"
2,Not what I expected,"I wound up giving away all 3 tubes, as there was nothing moisturizing about this product. It was purchased specifically for a dry patch on my face, but unfortunately, dried the area even more. This particular type of Olay product should be used for those who have very oily skin and problems with acne. It's not a bad product, just the wrong product for what I needed."
5,Great Seller & Awesome Product,"Fast delivery and excellent seller.....unfortunately, this product is no longer being sold and I am still trying to use as much as I can out of the bottle before trying to find a new one."
4,An Original Concept of Cinetic Techno.,"He has worked with four of my favorite artists and groups (Bjork, Tricky, U2 and Massive Attack), and that was a good introduction for me. According to my music-expert friends, ""Music for Babies"" was not the greatest thing. But I have listened to ""Turn the Dark Off"", an album that reveals Howard Bernstein in all his creative potential, showing us that he is more than an great productor-remixer. The music makes you evoke mentally kinetic images. Jazz, Jungle, Hip-Hop and Trip-hop influences are present, but always in service of Howie's incredible tallent. Enthusiastically recommended!"
1,"Can you say ""boring""?","A total waste of my book money. This author doesn't catch the Holmes/Waton/Mycroft characters at all. A collector's item, maybe, just for the Holmes name on the book, but the storyline is weak and ho-hum. I don't recommend this book at all. Or any others written by this author. Quoth the Raven..."
3,Somebody remix this amazing album!,"After 19 years I'm still amazed by the intensity of his performance. However, over time, hearing better mixed live JB (on record & TV clips) I have to say the band is too far back - in 2K we want need to hear Griggs up front! I've read that this l.p. utilized about 8 shows - so far only one alternate track has been issued. Although there couldn't be a hotter ""Hot Pants"" out there!"
5,"GREAT, BUT NOT AS GREAT AS THE FIRST TWO","GET THIS ALBUM/CD SIMPLY FOR IT'S HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE. THE FIRST APOLLO IS CHITLIN' CIRCUT BUTANE JAMES (THE GREATEST OF THE THREE) VOL. 2 MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE FUNK AND COMPOSING ON THE SPOT JAMS (FROM LET YOURSELF GO TO THERE WAS A TIME, TO ""I FEEL ALLRIGHT"" TO ""COLD SWEAT""). VOL. 3 IS WHERE BOBBY BYRD PLAYS A GREATER PART IN JAMES' SHOW. THE FIRST LIVE ALBUM FEATURING M.C. DANNY RAY (NOT INCLUDING SMASH'S ""SHOWTIME"" WITH FAKE APPLAUSE, OR ""THE JAMES BROWN SHOW"" WITH VARIOUS ARTISTS). IT'S A NEW DAY, BEWILDERED, SEX MACHINE, ESCAPE-ISM/MAKE IT FUNKY, TRY ME, FAST MEDLEY IS GREAT--ONE MINUTE & FIFTEEN SECONDS (CAN'T STAND IT, MOTHER POPCORN, I GOT THE FEELIN"") GIVE IT UP, SUPERBAD, GET INVOLVED, SOUL POWER, HOT PANTS....THE ENTIRE ALBUM IS GREAT, BUT FIRST, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE FIRST TWO!"
2,"McCormack is the only ""Exception"" to this ""Rule""","In a nutshell, McCormack does a splendid job considering what, and whom, he has to work with. It's hard to tell if Young is acting or merely reading her lines. Cattrall is absolutely hateful as the evil Carla. The plot is largely predictable, the charaters (as written) are shallow, and everyone involved with McCormack's character (his business partner, his shrink, the evil Carla) are suspect from the get-go. McCormack's acting skills are the only ""Exception"" that holds this mess of a ""Rule"" together."
2,Difficult and archaic,"While it is true that there is a shortage of introductory Sanskrit textbooks, one could possibly do better than Perry's book. The language is archaic and the explanations often unclear. Frequently, his attempts to help the student become instead a handicap. The exercises are useful, though, and sometimes amusing (as when, in one lesson, you learn words such as kill, poison, beat, hit, maim....). My suggestion would be to use the first few chapters of the Teach Yourself Sanskrit book and then to go straight into Nala (the Lanman Sanskrit Reader is useful) with Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar as aid."
1,OUTDATED,"This book was written several years ago (I think 1991), and the speech pathology field has changed/improved a LOT since then! The questions and answers were wrong in many cases. This book should not be in circulation! It won't help you with your Praxis studying."
5,Superb,"This is a superb toy. The balls rolling back and forth encourage eye tracking which is great for pre reading visual skills. Also, the colored tubes help children practice matching with colors as they can match the ball color to the tube. Further the pounding and hammering encourages eye hand coordination which is a very important skill to have. On top of all the 'educational' type reasons this is a good toy to have around, it's just plain fun and kids like it.I have a three year old who still likes this toy and an 18 month who pushes the balls in with her hand rather than use the hammer. They both like this toy.To keep my kids from pounding each other, I tied a string around the hammer and the toy. It keeps it on a leash so it's not hard to find (since they don't always connect it like the picture shows) and it keeps it from being easily used to hammer heads and furniture, just balls.I'd buy this one again if I had to. It is a good toy.Enjoy."
4,Great fun for the little one,"My 18-month old son enjoys this toy. He likes to pound the balls through the hole and watch them come down. There are 2 minor problems with the toy though: 1) the ball highest on track will not roll down if there is a ball in the next hole. The track isn't quite at the right height to allow the ball to roll freely. This causes some frustration. 2) If there are 2 balls already at the bottom, the 3rd ball may not roll out of the toy. A quick jiggle by a parent will allow the ball to roll out. Despite these minor items, my son still enjoys the toy. He loves to pound away at the balls."
2,Great in theory,"I sent this to my daughter for my grandson's first birthday. She returned it and emailed me this comment: ""I did return the pound-a-ball. It looked great, but the balls were impossible to pound through. You couldn't do it unless you had the strength of an adult. The hammer was the coolest part, but was useless for getting the balls in, and then when they went down they always took the same track and didn't really move any of the other things inside much."" So live and learn."
4,A slight let-down,"We based our purchase of this toy on the feedback previous listed. The toy appears durable and my son does enjoy it, but there are some things forcing us to reconsider our purchase. The balls really need to be pounded for them to go down the holes - my son can't do it yet and it takes my wife and I an above average hit. The balls have also got stuck en route down on occasion - and we haven't had it a month. Unless you believe your child really wants this, your $20 may be better spent elsewhere."
1,Did Not Work,"Once the balls traveled down the internal slide, they would get stuck at the bottom. You had to pick up the toy and shake it to get the balls out. Not well designed."
4,Fun For Kids,"My nephew enjoyed this toy, However I found the balls a touch bit too difficult to hammer down, thus making it much louder than need be. I think the age group should be set higher because of the strength needed, overall a well built toy. His older brother had no problems playing with it."
4,80s stars dance make over,"A surprisingly good return for the star most famous for singing in shopping malls. This collection of infectious dance will delight long time fans and gain many new ones. Includes a remake of ""I Think Were Alone Now"". welcome back Tiff."
5,Great,I love this cd reminds me of the old days. Tiffany is the best I love music that makes me dance
4,Tiffany still sounds good.,"Tiffany does some dance music in this rather good CD. I like that she's versatile as a songwriter and singer. She can do a variety of different styles, and do them all well. If you're in the mood to dance, this is the CD for you."
3,A good attempt to comeback,"Not one of Tiffany's best work. This disco-ish CD is ok, not the Tiffany that we're all familiar with. It's nice to see she's still recording, but it doesn't measure up to her earlier work. Her last CD ""Color of Silence"" was excellent, the songs were great. Had more feeling in it. If you're a Tiffany fan like me, then add this to your collection."
1,Fatal error,"I purchased this book because I needed to teach myself to use Microsoft Project in a hurry. Unfortunately, there's one big problem. The book indicates that there are ""sample Project files"" and ""solutions to exercises"" that pertain to many of the lessons, and that they are available on a particular website. Unfortunately, the files are no longer available on that website, and I can't find them anywhere else.This makes me furious, because there's no reason that SAMS couldn't make these files easily accessible on their own website, but they don't seem to want to support this book, which is still widely available for purchase. Don't buy this book unless you don't mind that files are unavailable."
1,LIKE A PEN WITHOUT INK,"I bought this book because it had supporting files which you could download from the website to work through the projects. However, the files were created with the beta version of the software and will not open in the full release version of Project 2000. So in other words you will not be able to do the exercises unless you are wanting to do allot of typing which in turn makes this book not able to be done in 24 hours."
5,good brake controller,Installed this brake controller on 2000 Toyota Tundra and it works great. It has 2 adjustments on it to get the braking action just right. Compact and fits very good under the dash. Very easy to hook up the wiring to the truck.
3,an ok controller,this controller is not variable as the harder you apply your brakes the more it does but for the money its not bad. I would by it again it works for what I am doing with a small camper. Just wish things like this could be made here in the usa.
4,Brakeman,"I was looking for a simple brake controller to haul a rented camper with my truck and this fit the bill. To complement this, I also had to buy a wiring kit that plugged into my truck's electronics under the dashboard as to not cut any of the factory wires. Once installed, it worked as advertised. At first I didn't have the sensitivity adjusted correctly and the truck and trailer jerked a bit. Once I had it right, the controller worked like a charm."
1,PURCHASE DIDNT ARRIVE WHEN IT WAS TO BE THERE,I PAID THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE BRAKE CONTROLLER TO GET HERE FAST. IT DIDNT ARRIVE SO I CALLED AND ANOTHER WAS SENT OUT. IT ARRIVED TWO DAYS LATER. THEN THE NEXT WEEK THE FIRST ONE CAME. SO I SENT IT BACK.
4,Brake control,I had to search the internet to find installation instructions for the unit. It would be better if they referenced a website or gave instructions for the wiring connections.
5,Great value,This was my first brake controller I installed so I don't know what the more expensive brake controllers do that this one doesn't but I am very happy with the Reese 74643. I have since bought another for another vehicle. The 74643 has a braking power level control knob and digital indicator and a Synch control slider on the side that controls how fast the brake power ramps up. There is a manual brake slider too if you want to brake the trailer manually but I am not sure when I will need that. Everything works great and was easy to understand how to use.
5,Best of Michelangeli..and Beethoven,"This DVD contains a sensational live registration of the opus 111 sonata of Beethoven and a studio recording of the beautiful opus 2 no. 3. This is as good as it gets!Michelangeli was extreme in the way that he did not care for stardom, maybe did not care for the public, did not really care for recording, however did unconditionally care for MUSIC, and music alone. This does show in these outstanding performances of the Beethoven sonatas.Michelangeli stated that all praise should go to the composer, not the musician. And praise should go to Beethoven: what marvellous pieces these are, what a miracle of creativity!I simply cannot believe that anyone loving Beethoven's piano music would not buy this DVD. It's an absolute must-have. Enjoy!"
3,Innaccurate,"In the interest of full disclosure, I'll admit I haven't read this book yet. I have read Hardt and Negri's work, though. There's a very simple factual inaccuracy in the publisher's blurb here on Amazon: Michael Hardt is said to be a Harvard professor. He's not. He's a professor at Duke University. That's a small detail, but gives me pause if it's indicative of the level of honesty that this book will entail."
3,just ok,"this book is not state specific, so look at your state's trooper website for more info. The book is overall a good source and gives plenty of hints and practice tests.But again this is an ok book, the test is not really something you can study for, personality questions make up half the test, and the book, in my opinion, glosses over this fact."
5,Nazareth's Song,"Another book for a variety of audiences, even those who are born again Christians, as well as those who aren't"
5,Wonderful hand healer,"This product is not greasy, but still works wonders on dry skin in the winter. It is a little pricy for 3 oz, but it is worth it."
3,"it's good, but ""Industrial Strength""?","Had read a great review on Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Healer in a magazine, and with a woodworking, cracked hands husband, it seemed a natural purchase. I bought 2 tubes, so he'd have instant access. Well, he's used it diligently for a few weeks now, and we're not seeing any HEALING, which is exactly what's needed for the cracks in his hands. I'm sorry to say I haven't found a magic potion here."
3,Not the answer to a prayer,"Based on the reviews and the ingredients, I had high hopes for this hand cream.I love the way it smells, and I love the way it feels on my hands--it's absorbed quickly, unlike Neutrogena Norwegian Formula--but it is not up to the job of keeping my hands soft and smooth. Worse, it did nothing for the cracks at my fingertips, except perhaps to make them worse.Still, I suspect for most, this product will work well--which is why I'm giving it three stars, even though it did not work for me--but for dry, cracked hands, O'Keefe's Working Hands cream is the better option."
5,Great Portraits,"This book helps us to see what 9/11 was on the receiving end. Through the stories and illustrations, we learn who the people were, what their lives were, and the people who continue to love them. It helps us come to grips with the value and importance of the lives that were lost that day."
2,Quantity over Quality,"If you had to reduce your life to one paragraph or even someone you loved, it would be difficult. So is the case for the Portraits 9/11/01. Though we get to see a photo and a glimpse into their lives, it doesn't have the space to delve deep enough into each life. Unfortunately, we have this problem because so many passed away that day. It might have been better to do a one-page tribute to each life, even if meant publishing more than one book. I do give credit for the enourmous task the reporters did in assembling such a mass of information when emotions were raw. One thing the editors did was group families and friends together so you could see that some of the tragedies were indeed worse for some than others. Bottom line: would I buy it again? Probably not."
3,Book Buying,"The book is well presented and very thorough.The trouble is I got immediately taken by all the 5 star reviews and I didnt realize that the format,was a profile of lives of those people before they that died. It wasnt what I was looking for. Of course that is in no way intended to hurt any one who reads this text.This is simply a lesson in book buying. Read and understand what you are buying.Its a simple lesson."
5,A glimpse into the lives lost,"I brought this book a few weeks ago and have started to read each and every portrait. In the three weeks that i have read i am only up to the letter C. Its tough to go through these portraits to see what America really lost that day - some amazing people. However, i find it my duty to get to know a little something of everyone who was lost that day. It tugs at the heartstrings but it makes me feel more patriotic with each portrait i read. And i will continue to pull this book out from the bookshelves through the years so that i never forget."
4,Forever Missed,"Just a beautiful profile of all the wonderful people whowere lost in the World Trade Center. Just beautiful everyday working people. They give a small break down on what theyloved to do. And how much they mean to their families.A wonderful book, which I wish was never printed!!"
5,Great tribute,"I bought this book years ago but can still say, without a doubt, what a GREAT book it is. I used to read several pages a night, and really enjoyed reading the personal stories of all the people involved in 9/11. The book allows you to put a face (in most cases there are pictures) with a name and read a short biography about each person (usually written by a family member). It's a good resource that details who these people are, instead of just being numbers. Also, in most cases, the stories tell how and why the particular person was where they were that morning, which is extremely interesting. It's a really great tribute."
5,James - the player,"You'll never hear another pianist break rules like they're shattered by James Brown in this compilation. Somebody stole it from me. If that was you, bring it back. If it wasn't go buy this set. It rocks."
5,This is a must-have,"You gotta be kidding - an 18-piece soul/funk orchestra? Every single soul and funk band that followed aspired to this sound. Listen to these discs, notice how much the music that followed over the next 30 years included its attributes, and you'll realize that not only was James Brown the Hardest Working Man in Showbusiness, he was - by far - one of the most talented. Insofar as being an influence, this set cements his place alongside the Beatles, Ray, and the Dowd/Ertegun/Wexler genius behind Atlantic Records.As important as his hits are, this set is the must-have James Brown recording."
4,Quicksand...shamefully overlooked,"Slip is the album of the 1990's that should only be eclipsed by one other album, nevermind from nirvana. Quicksand have been one step ahead of the game since their inception. Their melodic post-hardcore sound is easily digestible yet complex. This band is certainly never boring. Listen to Dine Alone and curse alternative america for never giving this band their proper chance."
1,This album only serves to remind me...,"how crappy the state of ""Hardcore"" music has gotten over the years."
5,Fantastic!,Great overview. Answers anything you ever wanted to know about Jewish ritual/ceremony/holidays. The author writes very clearly and tries to make all the Hebrew terms very simple to understand.
3,Average,"This book's title purports the book to be ""complete"" guide. This is an impossibility but this is a good ""summary"" guide to Judaism. Good but average."
5,A treasure for the neophyte,"I am not new to Judaism, but I have a lot to learn...actually, that is an understatement...I have mountains to learn! Essential Judaism is the one book that all people interested in Judaism, whether just in passing, as a potential convert, or as an actual Jew, should own. You will learn about all phases of Jewish life...from prayer, festivals, and how to live Jewishly, to Torah, mysticism, and philosophy. The narrative is very in-depth for such short overviews of all the various subjects and there are also sidebars to further elaborate on some things, including a listing of the entire 613 mitvot from the Torah. This book has been a valuable learning tool for me."
1,Disappointed,"The last Ani CD I bought was the Revelling/Reckoning pkg, which I picked up at her concert in Portland, ME (before it's realease date). It took me a while to connect w/ that cd, but I love it now. I was reluctant to pick up her newest cd ""Educated Guess"" after hearing her newest sounds (jazzier, softer, and more polished). I read the reviews on here and decided I should get it, since most people said it was the for die-hard Ani fans (which I am), and that she had gone back to her ""raw"" sounds. I was really disappointed. I've tried listening to it over and over, and I have yet to attatch myself to any of it. I find it sounds punchy- disconnected, almost off-key. This is the first album of hers which I haven't liked AT ALL. I should have picked up the ""SO much Laughter..."" cd pkg instead."
2,definitely not the best,"i've been a fan of Ani since the first albums and have every album. i love her solo stuff and have enjoyed a lot of her music with a band. i listened to this album closely and can't believe how bad it is. there isn't a single song on here that i want to listen to again. her live version of 'swim' is good, but the album version doesn't capture the song. some songs are downright horrible - dissonance in a bad way. the harmonies aren't there either. i saw her perform live solo and was blown away that she still had it. it's unfortunate to hear that she didn't translate that power to a studio album. it's even worse than 'up, up, up, up, up, up ..."""
1,Ugh!!,"This stuff is seriously the pits. As someone else said, if it didn't have the name Ani DiFranco on the cover and you'd heard it beforehand, you'd never have bought it. I understand all the inward reflection on divorce and all that, but where in God's name is the MUSIC?!? Holy moly, this album sucked! If you want to listen to someone sing about pain and the human condition, go buy a Patty Griffin album. Any Patty Griffin album. Patty is very painful to listen to, but in my opinion, it's also fun to listen to because the MUSIC is so incredible. And that is what is so sorely lacking here -- MUSIC. You want to vent your rants, fine. But don't put in on disc and expect us to pay our money to hear your dreck. Wow, I'm angry at this album."
1,My educated Guess,"I think Ani is in an artistic doldrum. I was so excited that she was going to release a solo album, but after hearing it I'm quite disappointed. Who cares if she did it all herself if it sounds this bad. She got carried away on the mixing. Her voice sounds bad. This is coming from a fervent Ani fan. Worst of all her lyrics aren't the beautifully perfect poetry they once were. Every artist of every medium has their less than inspiring moments. This is hers. I recommend Laura Love to all you Ani fans. When in a similar position as Ani Laura simply said ""I'd like to write a song that would just rock your world but I've fallen and I can't get up so I'll just stay down right here on the ground."" (happy little song) ---and that right on satire makes her less than wonderous work ART. I have faith Ani will enlightnen once more. Hopefully it's only an album away! While you wait listen to Laura!!!"
2,disappointing.....,"I only recently started listening to ani difranco- so i guess i'm a little biased cause i've only heard a few of her albums (not a pretty girl, lil plastic castle, clip, evolve, etc) but this album seems pretty lifeless. The songs don't really go anywhere or build any kind of mood. It's not a BAD album (hence the 2 stars) but it dosen't show her amazing songwriting/vocal ability. Not her best...."
4,Well suprise suprise,"I put off buying this album, after hearing others opinions about the quality of it; but I finally bit the bullet. I admit the fact that I really like this album is suprising! The sound is quite abrasive, with dubbed vocal that have dissident harmonies. But I think in context they add to the charm, they're like head voices that seem to add different views to the same song. It's like a bunch of little Anis! The album is really a far departure from any of Ani's older works, but I if you keep the album in context, it sounds pretty good. Bubble, Bodily, Grand Canyon, and Bliss Like This are all really great tunes! And the guitar grooves are strung crazy tight. ;-)"
4,Waiting awhile for this one,"Educated Guess is the CD that older Ani fans have been waiting years for. A back to basics, pouring out of the heart. Unfortunately for goat boy every other song on the album seems to deal with Ani's recent divorce, in more than blunt terms. I love the new CD and would recommend it to all the righteous babes out there"
3,quite a different ani,"ani's latest educated guess is noticeably quite different from her previous work and despite still displaying excellent lyrical skills, i dislike the fact that i find all the actual songs are sang similarly in this sort of weird and different style, droning sound which repeats through the album.- The poem 'grand canyon' would have to be the highlight. I still love ani though! =)"
2,"Artistic, but not listener friendly",I am a big fan of Ani. This CD shows her never ending artistic talent which I can appreciate for just that. But it is not something I am putting in my car to listen to on my way to work.
1,Not a pretty album...,"I purchased this album despite the negative reviews that I have been reading over and over again. YIKES.WHAT can I say about this album? I don't even feel that it should have been pressed, to be honest. The voice layering makes Ani sound out of tune and the music has no real melody. Also, I can't even tell the difference between one song and another. I must say that my liking for Ani has declined steadily since up up up up. It is not exciting. I could have made up better tunes while singing in the shower......Maybe she is smoking too much reefer and has a lack of judgment. Maybe a song sounds ""really cool man"" or she feels ""really inspired"" because her reality is altered. This perception only comes to mind because of the spanning dvd...I don't know. I simply think this album is aweful."
1,Oh...,"Yeah... I think this is the last Ani album i'll ever buy. I don't know, her albums seem to be getting worse every year, but every year we keep buying them, sure, some people like them, god knows why, but hey, taste is taste... But this is the worst one yet, guys."
2,Not Easy Listenning,"Every Ani CD seems to have 1 or 2 absolutely BRILLIANT songs and 1 or 2 songs that are personal favorites... at least. Even if the CD isn't a hit (R/R for example.) So, I cringed and kept listening through this one. Not only is there there nothing, the CD is actually difficult to listen to. For those with a musical ear, I'm sure you will find it takes its unusual melodies and harmonies too far and leaves you with a headache. As for the lyrics, I found them pretentious, especially in some of the spoken word. I'll give it a few more listens to see if I acclimatize to it... but for now, I don't recomend it."
3,Ani newcomer,"As an Ani first timer.. I picked up this album based on the guitar melodies alone. But as I listened in... and as I did, I have really grown to enjoy this album. As most people have said, its for the die hard Ani fans. With that in mind I would have to disagree. Ani did a wonderful job of putting out what she wanted to, and doing it with a certain amount of dignity. As it is about her recent divorce, this is what was on the girls mind and there is no limitations to her writing. Also the finger-picking guitar style that Ani develops is quite unique. Kudos to her for recording it on her own on the good ol' 8-track. Not many go that route anymore, but with her effort it was mixed beautifully. This album has inspired me to go out and purchase more work on Ani. So If you've been considering taking a risk on Ani's music, it's a excellent risk to take."
2,"Ani is an awesome musician, but...","Over the past couple of years, I have become a fan of Ani's music. However, this CD just doesn't have the spark that many of her other releases do. Although there are a few good songs on this album, it is seriously lacking in the lyrics department. Also, the instrumental sequences are not up to par. Many would argue that to be an unjust statement, because Ani did all the vocals, instruments, and mixing for this CD. But what good did all that work do? This album is dismal and lacks the spark that many of Ani's other releases capture. Hopefully she'll bounce back with her next one.If you are looking to buy an Ani album, I would not recommend this one. Try: Not A Pretty Girl, Dilate, Little Plastic Castle, or To the Teeth."
3,Missing Track.,"Frankly, my reason for purchasing the disc was to hear the full version of the track under the Stallone/Rourke fight near the end of the film. However, it wasn't on the disc. I had to go to IMDB and review the tracks to find out the missing track was Mint Royale's "" From Rusholme with Love."" I did subsequently purchase the Mint Royale disc so alls well that ends well."
4,What is that track???,"It to am looking for the track that plays over the finishing titles does anyone know what it is, please mail me. Otherwise great cd"
4,missing song??,"There is a song in Get Carter that I fell in love with immediately, unfortunately its not on the soundtrack. I heard the song when Stallone crashes the rich-nerdy guy's house party in search of revenge. I also heard the same song in Vanilla sky, during his birthday party. Can anyone help me find the name of this song and who's it by??thanks--d"
3,Artist & Name of Song on closing credits,"Just thought I'd help out the author of ""Techno Pop Stuff Worth Hearing"". You were asking about the song played during the closing credits. It's Groove Armada's ""If Everybody Looked The Same"" from their ""Vertigo"" album."
2,Probaly the song that many people are looking for...,"""There is a song in Get Carter that I fell in love with immediately, unfortunately its not on the soundtrack. I heard the song when Stallone crashes the rich-nerdy guy's house party in search of revenge. I also heard the same song in Vanilla sky, during his birthday party.

1,Illogical and just dumb,"I am so sorry I wasted time and money on this book. Fortunately, it wasn't much of either. Time travel romance, by its very nature, requires a stretch of the imagination and suspension of logic. However, this was too much. Her clothes went back in time with her ""soul"" but not her body? Please. It took her well over a day to figure out that she wasn't ""wearing"" her normal body? Again, please. Pathetic book."
4,WELL-RESEARCHED AND VIVIDLY PORTRAYED,"My grandfather served overseas during World War I, and years later died as a result of lung injuries sustained during those terrifying days. Many historians refute the atrocities of the Germans in Belgium; however, since my grandfather served for a time in Belgium, he knew first-hand that these stories of horror did in fact happen. The writing style is slightly dry in parts; however, the author has given a factual account of the events during this time period and has obviously completed much in-depth research. So many accounts of both World War I and II appear to be a duplication of someone else's research, and this is not the case with John Keegan. He has unearthed many facts that other author's failed to do. This is a book history buffs will not want to miss."
4,Gone but hopefully not forgotten...,"To those hardcore purists out there who just aren't into the consistent but still generic style of HC that Victory Records comes out with, you'd be doing yourself a world of good to pick up this INTENSE album. Deadguy broke up several years ago and only had this one album but they sure as hell made the most of their single oppurtunity. At first I could not believe that something so vicious would have actually been released by Victory but weird things do happen. To describe Deadguy is no easy task but they sound a little like the sickening chaos of Dillinger Escape Plan mixed in with a little metal tinged hardcore ala Cave-In. Of course in reality they had a style all their own but really, to anyone who likes hardcore with a bit more intensity then what Earth Crisis serves up, buy this album."
1,"good brand, lousy boot","i really like frye brand shoes, so i ordered these boots. they are sooooo uncomfortable. heavy, clunky, and junky. wore them a couple times and then donated them."
5,One of to best horror stories I ever read.,This has to be the best kept secrets in horror stories. I have read authors such as Anne Rice and I would consider She-Devil above anything Anne Rice has ever written. I couldn't put the book down... but I strongly recommend getting your hands on it any way possible. Thank you Lois Horowitz for several hours of horror.
4,Jimmy Jones Is Hard,"Big ups to Jimmy Jones, he came hard on ""On My Way To Church"" His lyrics forces the reader to marinate on them(as do all Dipset rappers!)The songs that stand out are songs are; ""Capo Status 1"", ""Only One Way Up"",""This is Jim Jones"", ""win Towers""(Bizzy Bone came correct), ""This is Gangster"", and ""Crunk Muzik"". Jim Jones is a decent lyricsist(he's no JR Writer). The production is OUTSTANDING! The only weak point is that Jimmy Jones did not have more solo songs. However the apperances of Juelz, Killa Cam, JR Writer(watch out for him), and Bizzy Bone are a plus. Overall A very good albulm.Shout out to Killa Mari, Hot Rod(stay strong), Ahmed, and my cousin Jonathan(I love you bro!)"
2,"Not very good, generic sounding pretty much..","The beats from the heatmakerz don't come near their earlier stuff first of all, plus this is nowhere near his mixtapes he put out IMO. Jones is not a great lyricist but atleast he had heartfelt music on his mixtapes with dope soul samples (His guest appearances) that got him by and made him enjoyable to listen to, this sound has few of that however. This is a dissapointment pretty much and even Dipset fans have to admit it whether they like to or not. I would skip out on this one and get his mixtapes like Ryder Muzik or cop another LP before looking into this one, this just an average gangsta rap album with generic sounding beats is pretty much a waste, nothing new here."
3,Take It For What It Is,"Jim Jones is no Jay-Z. Don't buy this album if you are expecting lyrical genius. Like I said; take it for what it is. The beats are pretty good, and they suit Jim Jones' style well. If you like straight gangsta-rap, pick up this CD."
2,Dipset have it twisted,jim jones really isnt a talented rapper and the only ok song is 'certified gangsters' feat. game of g unit. all he raps about is dipset drew and his stinking liquer company coming out which may suck as much as this album. the beats are lame awell.
5,Jim Jones>..... Dipset.... BBBBllllaaatttt,"i judge fairly every album i get now... as far as jim jones go... i never looked at him as rapper until i got this album tell u the truth the only reason why i bought the album was because i like the song twin towers... but when i went threw the cd i was amazed at alot of things like... lovely daze/memory lane was like damn y he did not come out with this a single... then u got let's ride, only one way up and a few other songs where he shows his talent to me i think lyrically he is the strongest in dipset because his cd is not talking about hoe's and pushing drugs the whole cd.... aww man he should of made a whole song to memory lane that song with that guitar is so ill"
1,On My Way To The TRASH!!!! BYRD CRAP GANG!,"WAT IS IT WITH JIM JONES THINKN HE CAN RAP? MAN FIRST OF ALL HIS LYRICS SOUND LIKE WILL SMITH IS HIS GHOST WRITER. AND """" CERTIFIED GANGSTA"""" ?? COME ON NOW WAT KINDA STUNT U TRYNA PULL WIT THIS. U KNOW AND I KNOW JIM JONES IS NO GANGSTA ! MAN THIS BYRD JUST SHH*TED ON HIS GANG! FIRST WE GOT A PINK WEARIN HOMO THINKIN HE CAN FLOW BUT ALWAYS SAYS THE SAME OLD BORIN THINGS AND NOW A HAIRY LUDACRIS WANNA BE THAT THINKS EATIN FRUIT LOOPS IN HIS FRONT PORCH IS CERITIED GANGSTA !!!!!

HE STRAIGHT THE JIGGA OF THE SOUTH. AND LIKE I SAID DONT WASTE MONEY ON BYRD SHH*TTT! GO GET (THE CARTER) U GOTTA FEEL ME!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,SEX MACHINE - JAMES BROWN,"THIS CD IS A VERY GOOD CD. I ALREADY HAVE JAMES BROWN LIVE AT THE APOLLO. THIS ONE HERE HAS A LOT MORE ENERGY,AND JAMES BROWN IS AT HIS BEST. THE PRICE FOR THIS CD WAS WELL WORTH IT."
2,Very disappointing live shots,"Only the disc two of the original vinyl album contains real live material, and it's highly disappointing. If you want to hear James Brown at his best, skip this album and buy Live at the Apollo Vol. 2 instead. The studio tracks (6 cuts) were much better, but they are available on many compilations, and you don't really need this album."
2,Cops Caught in the Act,"Its OK, but too many duplicate scenes from the TV show. Thought it was outtakes that couldn't be shown on TV."
3,lovely but...,"I am listening to the Rachmaninov as I write and much as it pains me to say it this performance simply does not catch fire. It has as much to do with Charles Owen, the pianist, as it does with Clein. This is Rachmaninov, after all, and a performance with somnolent piano playing is simply not an acceptable nor appropriate response to this music,. My sense is that Clein can do better this but that remains to be seen. Or rather heard, since the cover photo burns with a visual heat the music making does not match."
5,He IS the Soul Renegade!,"Each song has its own unique feel to it and gives off great vibes. When I listened to only two of the tracks, I immediately bought it. I've been grooving with it from start to finish ever since."
1,"If you like stinky, cold coffee, this is the model/brand for you!","Thankfully I got this coffee maker as a gift...Horrible! The coffee tastes like mold, even though I keep it clean, on top of that, the coffee is always cold! I am never going to buy or gift from Mr. Coffee!"
1,"if you want to replace in 8 months, then buy it, otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY!","I am so disappointed in this product. This is the 3rd one I have been thru. I won't make the mistake of getting this same coffee pot again though! I won't even buy a Mr. Coffee again in the future!Reason I replaced with same make/model is because I had a spare pot on hand from the first time I broke one accidentally and had a hard time finding them. The first one lasted about 1 year. 2nd one broke within the warranty and this one lasted even less at 8 months! Good thing I keep a spare on hand! I need my AM Coffee :-)My grandmother even rec'd the same pot as a gift and hers leaks in the bottom of it.Bottom line, poor quality for your money! Spend a little more and get something that will LAST!"
3,Mr COFFEE 12 CUP Coffee Maker RED,"I do love this coffee maker, it is the 2nd I bought. Although its life span is a short one. My sister went through 3 of these in a 1 year period. It just starts leaking for no apparent reason. It matches my other appliances perfectly (red chrome), so I took a chance, hoping I would get a good one. My first one lasted 8 months. (I remember my parents had a Mr Coffee maker that lasted 15 years!) It has a lot of features I like- for instance, it has the see through glass measuring window, and it dosen't soak the counter when you open the top lid to make the coffee. And you can pour the water on either side which is great since I have a faucet with a hose attachment that I use to fill it instead of pouring water in with the caraffe which can get messy. I keep the coffee maker right next to my sink at all times for this reason. I just wish it had a longer life span. Hopefully with enough complaints & returns, the company will fix the problem."
1,Interesting to look at but poorly made,"I bought this a year ago and recently began having problems with it. It beeps to notify you it is done brewing, but it does not finish brewing. I pour 12 cups of water in and get 8 cups back. If I tap the side of it and leave it for over an hour it will eventually come near to finish brewing - say about 10 cups - but leaving it on the hot plate for over an hour does not make for good tasting coffee. The first time this happened I didn't notice it hadn't made the whole 12 cups until I had already shut it off. The next morning when I poured 12 cups in it leaked all over the counter because the reservoir was full; this was my first indication that it hadn't been done brewing. It is an interesting design, particularly for a retro kitchen, but I recommend buying something else that won't cause problems in a year. I won't purchase Mr. Coffee products in the future."
1,Beware!! Do not buy! Shame on Mr. Coffee,It leaks....it makes bad coffee.....it ruined my counter and burned my hand!!!!! Shame on Mr Coffee for not recalling this diaster!!!!!
3,short life span,"Great coffee maker--however, ours only lasted a little over two years of daily use before it started to leak and the burner plate got a little on the melted side...."
1,mr coffee,"Bad design, the 'pause/brew' valve sticks, causing the pot to overflow. Then the clock gets moisture in it & quits. Tried 2, both same problem!"
5,I am pleased with this thermometer.,Currently my thermometer is on the wall of the freezer. No problems at all. I plan on ordering another one for the refrigerator. Just waiting to find another item in order to take advantage of Amazon's free shipping.
4,Good Product,I purchased this to use in my wine cooler. It's compact and out of the way and gives me an acurate reading.
5,Acurate and Precise,"I purchased one to monitor my refrigererator's temperature almost a year ago and have been so pleased with this product, that I'm buying another to keep my freezer temperature on mark.I have not experienced any problems with the suction cup, and can't think of any complaints I have with this thermometer!Excellent product."
2,"Great thermometer, but failed after (just over) a year","This is a nice fridge/freezer thermometer. However after a few months the LCD started fading, and now it's totally failed. I don't think it's a battery problem since if you wiggle the device some segments of the LCD digits reappear - I think it's some sort of internal connection problem. I've just emailed Taylor to see if they'll replace it even though it's just outside the usual one year warrantee period; will see what they come back with! Other than the failure it's a great thermometer.."
5,Very Cool Thermometer!,We order this Thermometer to give us more control over the temperature inside our refrigerator. This Taylor thermometer works great. Great value and a great product.
3,cheap,The display is difficult to see with the light in the refrigerator. There is no backlight so you need a flashlight to use this. Taylor Digital Stick On Refrigerator Thermometer
3,It's OK,"The thermometer itself works well but as far as the ""stick on"" part....not so well. I ""stuck"" it on the inside of the refrigerator but it keeps falling down. I've resorted to standing it up."
4,Attractive but keep falling down!,"As you can see, it's a nice and attractive digital thermometer, so aesthetics are 5-star. I would whole-heartedly recommend this thermometer *if* it would actually stick to the side of the refigerator (yes, I followed instructions about cleaning and wetting surface). I bought four (for two refrigerators) and each one has the same problem. As a result, they're all resting on shelves - not very neat, which is a little irritating. I've experimented with velcro, but that has trouble sticking to the side of the freezer. Next I may try glues or pastes designed for low-temperature environments (do they exist?)"
2,Falls off window. Lasted about a year.,"We bought two of these. They are a different color (ours are silver) but same brand and design.Three problems:1. It's mounted so it hangs off the side of the suction cup, putting a small amount of torque on the suction cup, which pulls it off the window after a few days. We tried cleaning the window and wetting it (didn't try the trick with vegetable oil). Really poor design. If they'd designed it so the display was BELOW or ABOVE the suction cup it would probably stay stuck.2. Display is transparent and unreadable at night.3. Both of these lasted about a year.I think it was fairly accurate if you keep it out of the sunlight (like any thermometer)"
3,Doesn't stick,"I assume that the thermometer function is working correctly, but the unit doesn't stick to the walls of my refrigerator. Since it keeps falling down, it's not easily visible without getting in the way of other foods on the shelf. They should create a better suction cup or include a 3M double sided sticky tape attachment."
3,Just ok,"The suction cup on this thermometer doesn't work well. Also, the display can be difficult to read if you have it anywhere near the door as it tends to fog up when the door is opened. Not a very good design. So far it appears to be about as accurate as my other refrigerator thermometers that hang or stand up."
2,Suspect Quality,"I purchase two of these at the same time to put in my new refrigerator. One for the freezer and one for the fridge. One of the suction cups would not stick to anything even following the directions for mounting carefully. There was also a 2-3 degree temperature difference between the two thermometers. Directions on where to locate the on/off and the celcius/fahrenheit switches are non existent. On the positive side, both thermometers were easy to read.I am returning both units and asking for replacements."
1,Thermometer,"I bought this item to use in our office as a room thermometer. It was awful!!! I am not sure if it was just a defective one or if it is just that inaccurate, but it was reading at least 10 degrees off!! We were having problems with the heat in the office not working right (it was always too cold) so we thought we would use this to regulate the thermostat. The problem was that when we took this out to use it read that the office was 80 degrees!!! Well being that we are sitting in polar fleeces and mittens, I am fairly confident that it is not a balmy 80 in here! I brought it home to try and it still was off by approximately 5-10 degrees from my home thermostat. I will be returning this item."
1,It will not stick to the inside of the refrigerator!,"This looks like it would be a really useful thermometer. But when you stick it to the inside wall of the frig it stick to the wall for only a few minutes and then falls down. I have tried wetting the suction cup and with the cup dry, neither way works for more than two or three minutes. I forgot about it and now guess it is too late to return It. Wish I had never bought it!"
4,Feeling hot? find out the room temperature.,"For almost no money, you can find out the room temperature with a small portable thermometer. Can't stand the heat in the kitchen? Freezing in the bedroom?Find out why. I don't know why it took me so long to buy this."
1,Not quite ready for prime time fridge thermometer,"The package looks nice - until you drop it and find that the fragile glass LCD display inside is loose, and moves about. In addition it is somewhat slippery and I dropped mine within minutes of starting to use it, breaking the clear plastic part from the white case. So I pulled it apart, only to find that there was a glued gasket holding the two halves together. So now it is in somewhat fragile in its state, as I pushed the two parts together loosely. And the display glass in the middle still moves about.Temperature-wise, it seems plenty accurate from 0F up to 72 F. The time constant is long. It settles over 10's of minutes.Not robust enough, but it looks cute, and is accurate. The suction cup is a wishful artifice. The case would have been more useful if it had a hanging hook somewhere. So I could affix it to the rack or a shelf."
4,good little thermometer,Works so good I ordered more. The only suggestion I have is to have the suction cup mount on the opposite side so you can read the temp without having to open the door.
1,Useless,"This is a waste of money. I wouldn't take one for free. The display is unreadable. It's some see-through digital display. So if your background is not white. You have no chance of reading it. Even with a white background (I put a piece of paper behind it, it was difficult at best. It has a switch for C or F, but they are reversed. The temperature fluctuates so much it's ridiculous. And finally even when you radically change the temperature (as I did between 40F and 70F it took hours to slowly creep up to around 70. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this piece of crap. I would give it no stars but you can't."
3,Cheap and slow thermometer,"This is a cheaply designed thermometer, the LCD screen is see-through, but the background screen color is nearly the same shade of grey as the letters making it difficult to read against a dark background. It takes a reading every 2.5 minutes, and it took 20 minutes to register a change of 3 degrees. The accuracy seems to be +/- 0.5 - 1.0 degree F. Has a power switch and F/C button under a sealed rubber flap."
3,Good meter if it accurate.,"At room termperature, the reading was about 7 degrees higher than a measurment that I took using a Fluke DMM w/temperature probe attached.It was also about 5 degrees higher then the meter on my room termperature control. So I am be bit concerned the accuracy. I've only just received it today but may echange it if it proves to be inaccurate. The thermometer is made in China."
4,Digital refrigerator thermometer,"This works well measuring temperature but as others have observed, it won't stay stuck to the inside of the refridgerator. This is a little annoying, but it does the job."
4,BUY,Excellent product. Works fine. A little olive and/or peanut oil helps it stick to the refrigerator wall. Hard to read from an angle though - but what isn't. Buy.
3,Ok but not spectacular,"I bought this book as a novice chess player hoping to improve my chess game. The book overall was ok but I did not care for the Socrates-approach type of teaching. I did like some of the strategies the author put forth but once again, the explanation method used with a teacher/student dampened the book's usefullness. Ok for the beginner but it would be best to read other books."
1,I have learned,I have spent my money on my last Pandolfini Book - he seems to come out with a new one every few months. I have now learned after buying about 5 of his books that some of them repeat the same things. Why not write a few good books instead of trying to write dozens of books that repeat the same things? I give this book one star because it repeats itself a lot from former things written by the same author.
3,"Not really so ultimate, but a decent book to start someoff","If you want a book to teach you how the pieces move this is not the right one. If you just learned how they move this is not the right one. But, if you have learned how the pieces move and have been playing for awhile, then this book does have its purpose. It move along from expecting you to be a beginner without any or much knowing how to play chess to getting you into more advanced stuff just so fast. Call it a ""steap learning curve"" - bingo, whamo, bongo and you are expected to know how the pieces move and the very basics and then it has you doing more adanced stuff if you get the point. But, if you are well in tune with basics, then there is some stuff to learn from. I like the movement of ""Learn Chess, a complege course"" for adults only and ""Chess foor Juniors"" for anyone, but especially kids as both are better arranged and are much more fun to read, period. This is not a bad book, just could use some rethinking on slowing things down."
4,Yet another great book from Pandolfini,"I assumed that this book would be about 4 of his others squished together. Actually, this is a brand new book.Pandolfini uses the socratic method to show an improving player (but not a complete novice) how to become a decent player.The book is very similar to Best Lessons of a Chess Coach (for which Pandolfini wrote the foreword) but at a lower level. I'd say this one is suited to E and D class players, around 1150-1350 USCF (whereas Best Lessons is for more like 1350+ or so).I think that you would improve quicker with Pandolfini's other, more visual books (and I STILL use those for drilling) but this book is painless and fairly entertaining -- and very inexpensive for its size."
4,"Good, but...",Would be perfect if there were about 2 grams of sugar versus approx 18 per serving. Leaves my teeth gritty and I brush my teeth well after every bowl.
3,Good in yogurt,For a gluten free granola I find this product to be a great price. I don't really like the granola to eat alone but it's really good in yogurt in the morning with some craisins added. If you are looking for something to eat alone I probably wouldn't purchase this product which is why I gave it 3 stars but it's good with yogurt.
3,Pretty good - more crunch than cranapple,"This is pretty good - mostly crunchy stuff with a few dried cranberries, and a little sweet for my taste (which may mean it's just right for others, since I don't normally sweeten my breakfast cereal). I didn't often eat granola even back when I could, so while this was a welcome change for a few days, I've gone back to theBob's Red Mill Gluten Free Quick Cooking Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)I normally eat. I can put as much fruit as I want into it and sweeten it to taste.But for granola, this is okay. A little more variety in the ingredients (more fruit, something else that looks/tastes/crunches differently) would be nice, but then, I've never been a big granola fan"
1,Cereal...Enjoy Life Cranapple Crunch Granola,Don't buy this product...it is very hard to chew...there are also very little cranapples...attempted to return this product to Enjoy Life..but they never responded to my disappointment in their cereal
4,Works for me,"I had only used this product for a few weeks when my best friend looked at me and said ""What are you doing to your face? You look so good."" I told her that the only thing that I had done was to use the Rejuvenique Mask. My husband bought it for me about 10 years ago. When I pluged it in, it worked great and the products still seemed fresh!Another friend of mine had told me many years ago that when her mother had a stoke, the nurse used an ""electrical facial machine"" on her mom and it made her look so much younger. I'm thinking this device might work based on that same techique. Anyway, I followed the directions and have had no unpleasantness and my face looks and feels better. I wish the products were more accessible."
3,The Dealer is a great seller,"It is okay..it zaps your face , but I have seen no results . I would of giving it 1 star but the shipper was so fast..i would deal w this dealer again , but the product is to large for my face , I don't think it works as the company claims"
1,texas chainsaw massacre mask!,this nightmare mask dose'nt look this way just because!it dose'nt burn your face for nothing.this is the official mask from hell. i guess it is great for halloween parties etc. but that's about it. don't use this mask unless you want to have a real life texas chainsaw massacre or micheal meyers experience!
1,Rejuvenique Facial Toning System -Don't Bother,I received a burn on my face from this product. I still have a scar from it two years later. I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone. I think it's dangerous and should be taken off the market.
1,FDA Warns Manufacturer,"People, this thing is pure quackery. There is ZERO objective evidence that it works and the manufacturer has been given a warning by the FDA to prove their claims. See: [...]Like so many junk products like it, people think it works because they WANT it to work so badly they can't be objective about results."
1,awful,"the package of the kit looks too old. it seems like the item has been stored since 2 years in a warehouse. the gel pot was dry. the gel got dry and the kit comes with a vhs, not even a dvd."
5,Success,"I have successfully scared the life out of so many people with this. All I do is walk around my house with it on, and all the little kiddies next door freak out and run away, shouting that there's a phantom in my house. It's great."
1,Makes a great Halloween mask!,"I gotta admit, I bought this facial toning mask in complete good faith.I researched the concept as much as I could, and generally felt that it had some credence.I used it faithfully for a NUMBER OF MONTHS!Hey, it was pretty easy to use: just put it on and watch TV.I finally came to the conclusion that not only was it not making me younger looking,but it was actually making me look older!A pox on you Linda Evans!I stopped using it and just started doing some common sense facial exercises.Lookin' good now.However, it does have a small worth as one heck of a scary looking Halloween Mask!"
4,I didn't know that Scott could be amusing and detailed at the same time,"This book is a nice example of how to make a real life story, entertained and detailed in descriptions at the same time. The first expedition of Scott is vivdly told from the account of the same Robert F. Scott in the first of legendary expeditions going to the south pole 100 ya. If you have been to London anytime, it will make you enjoy more, because Scott describes the first stages of his voyage in London and how the english people helped him to undertake this huge mission.Highly reccomendable for those who enjoy reading about adventures and expeditions..."
2,It's ok ~ but could have been a lot better,"Basically, 90% of the DVD is this guy talking. I guess he loves the camera alot (or himself). I wish they had spent more time with a photograph travel into the history of Goju Ryu versus just watching him stand in front of the camera the majority of the time. It's ""OK"" but could have been soooooo much better. So if you want a DVD that's essentially a speech in front of a camera while he blocks Miyagi's home in the background - get it. I really wish there were photo's of Okinawa, showing the roots of where this fine art was developed, photo's of the area of China where it came from. You know ~ the HISTORY of the darn thing so you can get a better feel for it. Such a waste to have the camera rolling and be in the area and not film any of it."
1,Same as everything else these guys sell,"From the number of historical inaccuracies in this amateur attempt at a karate documentary, it is obvious that the presenter knows absolutely nothing about the subject, and has made no attempt at serious research. He even makes errors with information he has ""borrowed"" from legitimate sources such as ""The History of Karate - Goju Ryu"" by Morio Higaonna and Classical Fighting Arts magazine because his knowledge of Goju Ryu in particular, and karate in general, is virtually non-existent.The ""many little known facts"" alluded to in the product description are ""little known"" because they are not ""facts"" but fiction. All in all, exactly what we have come to expect from this source."
3,natural progression of disk #2,"the comas are a band where one can literally hear the growth of the musicians in terms of creativity and originality from each album to the next. I didn't care for ""wave to make friends"" to much. I love ""conductor"". this album is snugly nestled between the two. it fits there nicely. doesn't blow me away, but there are some really pretty tracks here. i'd say it was worth buying, but i am really looking foward to their next release. the comas keep getting better and better...."
2,A BLUNT NEEDLE,"Oh no, another dreary indie rock record. The Comas should fall farther into their comatose state or snap out of it completely, as this record fails to excite or seduce. Imagine if you will Radiohead crossed with Marcy Playground or barbed wire crossed with cotton candy. The gentle sing-songy vocals are joined by a lot of uninspired blip and bleep sound effects that become annoying and the melodic hooks demand attention like an insect buzzing around your face does."
3,FE deluxe instead,"This was released in order to put together the best of their Fillmore shows not to take the original Fillmore east and eat a peach songs and put them together. The sound is not that great and although the performances are obviously great, it is not the original Fillmore east. The DELUXE EDITION that came out in 2003 is the vital one to own. It has The original Fillmore East plus the Eat A Peach songs. (mountain jam, one way out, and trouble no more) The sound is of phenomenal quality as well. The booklet also has great photos and an essay. This a vital purchase even if you have the original."
4,Waiting for the next re-issue,"I was very excited when I heard that this album was out. I owned the vinyl (a friend borrowed it but never returned it...), cassette (I taped the vinyl so I could play it in the car) and the CD (Live at the FE). So all the hype from the reviews I read made me buy one right away.After I listened to the The Fillmore Concerts a few times, I got mixed impressions. The recording is definitely better (except for the bass which is too weak) but the totality in itself was not 100% gratifying (as compared to the Live at FE). ..."
3,"Well, It's Not Quite In the Grateful Dead's League......","But as far as live albums go if you don't count Dead records this this one is easily among the top five. The Whipping Post>Mountain Jam is pretty impressive but I've got the tape of the Dead's performance from later that night (Allmans were opening up for the Dead) and what they did jamming wise made the Allman's attempt seem feeble.Still, all in all, pretty damn good."
5,Hall of Fame Set,"There are enough detailed reviews here for you to be informed about the content. I'm just adding that I rank this as one of the best rock, blues-rock discs of all time. It also makes the list as one of the very best live performance recordings of all time. Even if you are hardcore fan of another style you will surely appreciate this for it's expression as art. I've been listening to the Fillmore shows since the original release in '71. I keep coming back for more. This expanded edition is the ESSENTIAL now."
5,A CLASSIC FOR THE AGES!,"Sheer musical genius...the communication among the players is astounding. ""Mountain Jam"" is the single greatest piece of live music ever played - a Monument.."
5,The best gets better and better,"Hey, I love ""Live at Fillmore East,"" but here's why this remix is so vital -- for those of us who never got to see Duane and Berry together, we are now able to hear the entire classic Fillmore set in its entirety. Yes, different sets, different nights, but it's the TOTALITY of it that makes it so important.And MOST importantly, to be able to hear Whipping Post and Mountain Jam as they were originally played, one to other, seamlessly...is astounding. That's 55-56 minutes of non-stop playing. How incredible is that by any standards -- then or now?My only complaint, however -- the version of Hot 'Lanta used for this CD. The sax sounds so out of place and so intrusive.Like the ads said when it came out -- the best live album ever just got better!"
4,Duane's Finest Hour,"This collection includes five tracks not on the original ""Fillmore East"" CD. ""Trouble No More"", ""Don't Keep Me Wonderin'"", ""One Way Out"" & ""Drunken Hearted Boy"" are all great additions, & make this collection superior to the original. However, ""Mountain Jam"" could've been omitted. I'm sorry, but no matter how great a band is, no one can keep a song interesting for 33 minutes! Still worth it for the other additions, though."
3,NOT The Best Live Album,"All the people on here falling all over themselves trying to call this the ""best live album ever made"" need to cool off for a little while and try listening to a few other live records before you prematurely call this one the king.It's good. But it's not the best. B.B. King. Miles Davis. Grateful Dead. Albert Collins. Hound Dog Taylor. ALL of these names have cut live albums FAR superior to this one. Hell, I""m no Deadhead, but the Dead alone have a handful of live albums that outclass this one. Go buy yourself an Alber King record. Then you will see what TRUE Blues Guitar is all about. He could match anything the Allmans did. But they couldn't touch most of the stuff he did."
5,Out of the darkness into the Light,"What a revelation. So glad to have read this book. Such a shame that the medical elite have to keep the American public in the dark on the more up to date science on why we are so heart attack prone in this country. I am so glad Dr. McGee is not afaid to tell the truth! People have to be more invovled and take more initiative in their health care and truly do some of their own research and don't just take their doctor's word for it as most doctors just parrot the party line or are too busy to find out the latest science on the why's of bodily manfunctions in their patients.Need more preventative options instead of just masking the real problems with a pill or diet that really doesn't work. Treat the cause not the symptoms. Thanks Dr. McGee for enlightening me on a very important subject! Oh, and this book read like a murder mystery! After the first two chapters, I was hooked and couldn't stop reading it.Sincerely,Dotty B."
3,Fact check?,"Good book, well written...but reading the portion that refers to Charlotte as North Carolina's ""capital city"", kinda ruins some creditibility for the author. Looks like someone would have caught that mistake..."
2,Make it stop! PLEASE make it stop!!!,"This movie sucked! It had dry acting and the monsters looked really stupid. These supposedly ""horrifying"" monsters look more like senile old men on crack. The movie drug on and on and you just wanted ever so badly to hit the stop button but kept youself from doing so (that is, if you rented it). In other words, don't waste your time on this peice-o-trash."
3,Turkey. dear.,"After the sad news of the premature (71) death of actor Jon Finch (Polanksi's Macbeth, Hitchcock's Frenzy, Death on the Nile, Ben Hall (Oz TV miniseries) in early 2013 I ordered in his honour a few of his films that I had not seen for a retrospective. ""Lurking Fear"" is a turkey, dear. Jon Finch has little to do but look handsome and menacing before having his face gouged. This is not his finest hour. It's low budget so he can hardly have done it for the money but perhaps that is all this gig had going for it. He is seen to much better advantage in the aforementioned better known films and in a 90's British TV film ""Unexplained Laughter"" with Diana Rigg."
2,Lovecraft must be spinning in his grave,"I was extremely dissapointed to see how this movie butchered H.P. Lovecraft's original story. The history of the Martense family is only vaguely touched upon, wherein the original story it was the central theme. The FX wasn't half bad, and the acting was okay. If you can totally seperate this movie from the original story, you'll find it's an average movie."
4,I like it,"I wish the size is bigger.I will buy it again,it keeps the hair soft and shining.I am not sure if there a bigger size.If your hair is dry try it."
2,Treatment for dry brittle hair?.,I do not use to oreal product but I was Rey exited with the reviews and I got this.You know what ? My hair was more dryer than before and start breaking just one use. I don't know what to say but I will never use it again. Sorry but it did not work for me
2,blah,wife didn't enjoy this product much. Gave her more dandruff and split ends. She is going with something more natural and effective.
1,Don't turn on,"I have tried just batteries, just ac adapter, batteries and ac adapter. I hold the play button down as it says to do in the instructions....power won't come on. Of course the company is bankrupt so I can't get any help there. I guess I will just have to return them."
4,Very good Steve & Eydie,"I've been a a fan of Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme -- together and individually -- since 1961. I bought this LP in my hometown of Glen Rock, N.J. off the Rock Ridge Pharmacy's record rack in the early 60's. It was a promotional record produced for (""no foolin') Silvikrin Shampoo! But produced by their first and long-time arranger Don Costa, it's one of their best joint efforts. My vinyl was lost over the years, and I was thrilled to find the album here."
5,When Cars Were Cars,"A book of 1940s through 1960's automotive concept art done by mostly-GM designers whose job it was to think ahead. Fun to look at the different media used, as well as to try to identify what then-far-out styling features actually made it onto actual cars.These days, when all an automotive designer has to do is draw a boiled sweet potato and add windows, headlights, taillights and tires, it's great to relive an era of tailfins, chrome, baby moon hubcaps, whitewalls and two-tone paint jobs."
3,"Beautiful pictures, poor provenance","Although the pictures are gorgeous, no dates to speak of are given. Nearly everything is no earlier than about 1800 in style (exhibiting strong Manchu and Tibetan influences, among other things), and hardly anything (with the exception of some trouser patterns and possibly some boots/shoes) is appropriate for Mongol Empire reenactment. Although an interesting book, it is not useful for documentation for reenactment/living history purposes, contrary to the previous reviewer's assertion.The lack of dates and specific provenance is a major flaw for its use as a guide to traditional dress as well.In sum, I would give it the following ratings:*** for its intended purpose (an overview of traditional Mongol dress)* for its common misuse, as documentation for medieval Mongol dress (which it is not)***** stars for the gorgeous photographs"
3,Almost But Not Right,"I bought this book hoping that it would come in handy when I realize that I don't have an ingredient on hand and need to make a switch in a pinch.Though it has lots of substitutions, most are simply switches for ingredients in the same family (yellow onions ---> chives, etc...). Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was hoping that it would cover ingredients substitutions that weren't so obvious.I would have given it a 4 star rating even so but my biggest problem is that the layout is really poor. Trying to find substitutions for red or white wine are either not in their or not in an order that makes sense to me anyway.It is handy but not the end all, be all of books. Maybe the 4th edition will be better."
5,Study to show yourself approved,"In Weighed and Found Wanting, Pastor Bill Randles points out a biblically alarming reality. Spirtual drunkedness is not a blessing from God, but a Judgement! As these signs and wonders continue to sweep through the Church, will we be willing to Study and Show Ourselves Approved??"
1,China JUNK!!!,Seller said it was made and machined in the USA and it came and it's made in CHINA and I cant get my shipping and price paid back NEVER AGAIN will I buy from AMAZON NEVER!!!
2,What happened to the bass?,"I have gone to see the Moody's three times in the last ten years, the first time with the full blown orchestra ala Red Rocks. I've always enjoyed their music and was excited to see the concert come out on CD. Then I listened to the CD and scratched my head, granted they never were a ""heavy"" group but John Lodge's bass lines were a foundation for their songs and it is missing in action. I tried cranking up the bass control but there's nothing there! What a disappointment! Did I just get a bad copy or is everybody else reviewing this album listening on a 2 inch speaker. I didn't think it would bother me too much at first, but I don't listen to it anymore because I find such pansy sonic quality irritating. Tiny Tim on the mixing board!"
3,Live 1992 Concert Mixes Old And New Songs.,"From 1967 onwards The Moody Blues have been the leading light a mixture in classical music and melodic sounding rock.Here are a good array of tracks from the album Days Of Future Passed to, for myself less known songs from the 1980s and very early 1990s.From the former era Tuesday Afternoon and Nights in White Satin lead the way and Ride My See Saw closes this CD.In between good stuff includes I Know You're Out There Somewhere, The Voice and You're Wildest Dreams.Maybe this looses a star for one or two songs that are played with an aparrent lack of conviction, but it's still provides lots to enjoy."
2,disappointed,"I have always enjoyed the Moody Blues having some vinyl and cd's but all have been studio albums. This album cannot be recommended as the recording is weak, very shallow and tinny. The vocals on this album are weak beyond belief. I thought this cd would capture an essence that studio recordings lack, however I wished I had not heard how weak vocally this band has become."
2,Moody Blahs,"What made the Moody Blues unique in concert for years and years prior to going ""orchestral"" was how they would adopt their highly produced and mostly acoustic album tracks to a straight ahead, minimalized rocknroll live version. Try to imagine Justin Hayward madly strumming the opening chords of ""Question"" on electric guitar, for example. Well, unfortunately, you don't get that kind of rowdiness and spontanaeity on this album. All the tracks somewhat weakly mirror the better studio versions. Also, their voices are not ageing well. Justin Hayward is so laughably Briish on ""Tuesday Afternoon"" and Ray Thomas' awful warbling on ""For My Lady"" made my 4-year-old daughter cry when she first heard it."
4,A Return to Veggie Goodness,"I had been disappointed with the most recent Veggie releases, so this one was a pleasant surprise. This was much better than Sumo of the Opera or Duke and the Great Pie War."
1,unknown language,"This item got to me on time and in good condidion. There was even a little note from the seller. My grandson wanted to watch this video, but after a few minutes of watching, I realized that it wasn't in English. I looked over the case and the label, but there was no indication that it wasn't English. I wonder if the seller knew this.""Veggie Tales: Minnesota Cuke - The Search for Samson's Hairbrush - A Lesson in Dealing with Bullies."""
4,Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush,My daughter is 3 and she really enjoys this movie.
1,Waste of money,I didn't like it at all. My three year old son didn't like it either.I really wasted my money.
1,"Bible Quotes, The Rapture, Hell",The Veggie Tales franchise is a bible based group of products that include teaching about such beliefs as The Rapture and such concepts as people Going to Hell. If this is OK with you then enjoy. If you do not wish to expose your children to this programming you will want to skip this franchise of cartoons.
4,Delightful Experience,"This is one of the best of the ""Veggie Tales"" features I've seen. It offers a lesson in dealing with bullies and, equally important, helps protect a child's self-esteem when made to feel he/she is less than others.At one time or another, almost everyone has to contend with a bully or two and this, though not able to offer solutions to every instance, can help a child better understand some of the reasons an individual tries to belittle another and how to cope with it.This is one I highly recommend, especially for young children just entering first grade or starting at a new school when they are in the lower elementary grades.Better yet, buy it for a child who hasn't yet begun school and then watch it with the youngster so he/she and you can be better prepared when it happens."
4,Wonderful and gracious cookbook...,"This cookbook really is incredible. It's not only filled with many wonderful recipes from the famous New Orleans restaurant, but also with stories about the history of the legendary restaurant as well.The recipes are just what you would expect - the best. Everything from appetizers to drinks to mouth watering desserts are included. What I love most though is along with most of the recipes are little stories behind the recipes. Where they came from. How they came to the restaurant. There's also some short tales about the history of the restaurant itself. That's what I love most about the cookbook - the little stories that make the recipes that much more special.Overall the book is incredible and I highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I thought it could have had some more pictures and illustrations."
5,Creole Class Act,"As a longtime fan of Commander's Palace (and creole and cajun cuisine in general), I found the book as much fun to read as the dishes were to prepare. The beautifully presented recipes and well written preparation tips were made all the better by the inclusion of tidbits of New Orleans and Brennan family history. This book is a must have for both veteran and novice cooks interested in preparing great Louisiana style food.Every recipe that we have tried from this book has been a hands down home run with our friends and family. The recipes are scaled for truly generous portions. For Christmas Eve dinner we prepared the Venison Stew and the Jalepeno Corn Bread for family in the upper midwest. They liked the meal so much that we left them the recipe book and I have just ordered another for myself!"
5,AB FAB!,"This signed first edition is in immaculate condition. It arrived well packaged and earlier than expected. Kudos to the vendor!If you've ever eaten in New Orleans, this cookbook will just call out to you to prepare dishes -- Creole Bread Pudding, Shrimp, and so much more. This is a premier go-to book for the incredible food served at Commander's. Heck, just wandering through the pages is a luscious experience...So much so that you'll want to run out to the grocery store and start cooking."
4,Impressive performance for a laptop!,"Have owned a 1525 US since October 15,2002. What a great performer. Lots of Power 2.4 , great display 15"". I travel to job sites and with case and laptop at 7 lbs + its a little heavy, but the power is worth it. Battery time appears to be 2-2 1/2 hrs , easy recharge when plugged in. There was confusion on some 1525 us models having 60 g hard drives , mine has 40 g and thats plenty.Link this up with a 450cbi hp printer and you have a great travel combo."
1,DEFECTIVE,"Defective.They worked partially for the first day or so. They were counted in my bios and XP sp2 operating system, but did not give any boost at all as if they were not even working. Then about the 2nd or 3rd day they prevented my computer from booting or even accessing bios. So I took the sticks out and my pc worked fine. I tested my computer ram slots and they are all good. But when I put the EDGE ram sticks in, both of them or by themselves, my computer ether does the 'bad ram beep' (with first stick) or my screen pixels go crazy (with second stick). Certainly bad ram.I contacted BuyNow and, while they did respond within 24 hours telling me to setup an RMA, they gave no instructions on how to do so. So now I have to waste more time trying to find out how to get the RMA set up.I never used EDGE memory or even heard of it before recently, but I don't recommend buying that brand."
4,Dollar Store!,"My dollar store carries these jetstream uniballs in two-packs. I like the 1.0 line, which is a medium bic point. Works great! The red color is especially nice ... it's a slightly deeper red than I typically see in pens, like a papermate (yuck!).Recommended!"
1,Stopped Working,"When I first used one of these pens, it wrote so nicely that my handwriting was actually more legible. I went ahead and bought a pack from Amazon and in a short amount of time the pens stopped producing ink. It writes as if the ink ran out, but it's nearly full. I didn't abuse the pen, so I don't know why this happened, but I'd expect a little more dependability for the price of these things. Looks like I'm sticking with the freebies I pick up at my local bank. At least they keep working."
1,Can't even fulfill a pen set correctly,"This package arrived with 3 pens, not 4. Both the description and the photo said 4 pens were included. WTH?"
2,Smears easily on glossy paper,"I have been looking for a pen that will dry quickly and not smear when writing on glossy paper. This is not that pen. It writes very smoothly on standard paper, and does dry rather quickly. For most writing tasks, this is a fine pen. But I need a pen that will dry instantly, even on the glossy paper of a photo book. This one disappointed me greatly, as it is possible to smear the text into illegibility with just a quick wipe of the finger for several seconds after writing."
1,Same info on Monroe's website for free!,"This book is a total waste of money. I thought it would present some relevent research on the effects of Hemi Sync or binaural beats or whatever on states of consciousness, but it was mostly anecdotal reports and the little bit of ""scientific research"" it rehashes is already available for free perusal at Monroe-Institute.org.Peace!"
2,"Great Concept, Bad Execution","I was very excited to get this dvd, as an avid practioner of Shorin-Ryu. However, the dvd left a lot to be desired. There is very lot footage of Soken, and the majority of the footage that is shown can be found on youtube for free. I think that this was just a sad attempt of George Alexander attempting to make money again. I would not waste your money, just search for Master Soken on youtube and you will have everything that this dvd has to offer."
4,The real thing,"I discovered this book two or three years ago and find that I keep coming back to it. Esway, a Roman Catholic laywoman, invites the reader into her life of prayer in an accessible and unpretentious way. With section headings like ""Prayer Heals Our Wounded Emotions,"" ""Prayer Helps Us Give Up Control,"" and ""Prayer Helps Slow Time Down"" (I'm still working on that one), she shares her own experiences while at the same time dispensing sound advice about topics such as silence, centering, and spiritual companionship. Whenever I return to this book, I feel like I'm visiting an old friend."
3,Just ok,Although this is not my favourite Catherine Cookson book it still was an enjoyable read. Just a little bit too drawn out. However there were surprising twists and turns that kept me reading to the end.
4,Not one of Cooksons best!,"The main character ""the man who cried"" was just not a great character and as the main character you wanted to like him; I couldn't. He was very weak and unsympathetic. I did like the ending."
5,my opinion,I recieved the Tommy Hilfiger sheets shortly after ordering them and they are wonderful. Well worth the money. Thank you
2,Bad Design-Probably never tested by the designer,"The gaps between the bars are too small so the ash doesn't fall through but just builds up. I doubt that the person who designed this ever tested it or used it. The Sampson 18"" grate with 1"" between the bars is probably better. If I can't cut out half the bars with my reciprocating saw, I may try that. It gets two stars instead of one because you can force the ashes through with the pieces of wood so it is better that the four bar grates which allow large pieces to fall through."
3,Good but a difficult read,"This book has a collaboration of authors and the writing style varies greatly from one chapter to the next. Some are very difficult to read and can turn an interesting topic into a snooze fest.Overall it is a very good book that looks at different points of view (i.e., conservative, liberal, feminist). I couldn't rate it that high though because it was difficult to read."
1,garbabage,I unfortunately bought this item by cash.The contents on this are garbagesI hope you have no interest on this.The title is totally different from contents.I mean you will not get any information if youget this item from being attracted by title.
1,DEFECTIVE,"We have ordered 2 so far and both had holes and bad seams, Amazon replaced it but it is not durable"
5,Great Pictures - Fun Story Line,"Mooney B. Finch (also the subject of another book) has the ability to make his drawings real - or to erase things and make them go away. One afternoon he draws himself a train, and before you know it he's in the middle of a train robbery. He draws and erases the robber's gun, then his pants (leaving only his underwear). There are a few other slapstick moments before the robber is caught,and Mooney B. Finch returns to the peace of his front stoop and his family."
5,owner,"best metal saw on the marketit will cut 1 inch metal without any trouble, if you use it the right way,on thin metal you have to feed it real slow are you will knock the teeth off"
5,Extrication,We bought this saw to use for vehicle extrication. It is great for this use. Cut open a trunk or hood in seconds. Take a top off rapidly. Let it do the work and you could not ask for a better tool.
1,"same ""muddy"" and worn recording of Angel Baby","There are three versions of Angel Baby on this disc...non of them up to the original standards. The mono US version is the same muddy recording that i tunes offers - irritating, like nails on a chalkboard! The re-recorded version is better quality but Rosie's voice lacks the young crackle of the original....almost sounds like a different artist. The UK version is the best of the 3, but still not the US version I am looking for. Geez, you'd think that if the master is shot that they would search for a decent 45rpm version and re-master it. Very dissappointed and feel ripped off."
3,Album shows promise in Coast's musical maturation,"This album graduates from the territory covered by ""Seniors and Juniors,"" Marshmallow Coast's first album, and into the college ranks, leaving a listener hoping for a major-league release from the band in the next year or two. The addition of two Of Montreal members seems to give Marshmallow Coast frontman Andy Gonzales a big boost, pushing the songwriting to new heights. The album as a whole stands up to many other Elephant 6/Kindercore releases, and some individual songs, such as ""Lilypad,"" ""Loneliest Heart in Texas"" and ""Audience is Deaf,"" stand on their own as great tunes. The ""Bizarre Classical"" tunes are entertaining, too. Based on this release, Gonzales should be one or two albums away from creating something outstanding. In the meantime, the fact that his music simply is satisfying makes it better than most stuff out there today."
2,Scratched disk,"Hey guys, I got my Krav Maga dvd even in the package I could hear it rattling around. I got it out, and it was scratched to heck. The tactics that it teaches seem easy enough to employ, the problem was the disk was so mangled I could barely get 5 mintues in."
4,Specific Phrases,"The guitar tone on the demonstration tracks is crystal clear. All of these licks work over the backgrounds at full and half speed which is odd or brilliant depending on your viewpoint. I've found that perhaps half of the licks can be applied to different musical situations and the other half are specific to the groove they enhance. The demonstration CD is essential to this book because you really need to hear these licks. Your technique should improve just by trying to play these licks as the author does. There is a certain repetitiveness in these licks after awhile but whether you are contemplating a purchase for theory or technique, there is something to be derived on both fronts. I like this book enough that I am contemplating another purchase by this author. At the price it's selling for it's a good buy but be sure it comes with the cd."
4,Interesting story.,"Having Our Say by Amy Hill Hearth is a very interesting book to read. It talks about issues that happened after the Civil War. The two sisters Sadie and Bessie Delany tell the story in a way that is easy to understand and I recomend it. I read Sara Plain and Tall by Patricia Maclachlan and it was very confusing but Having Our Say was very easy to understand and the theme of the book is very interesting. I think that Having Our Say is a very good book, If you want to know something about slavery and part of the history of the U.S."
4,Excellent,"This book is one of the most learning and inspiring books I have ever read. I come from Denmark and therfore I am not so familiar with Black history, this book gave me the oppurtunity to learn it from a first person perspective. Thank you for writing this wonderful book."
5,This book is great and very funny.,I have been reading this book for school for awhile now.This is have made me laugh and cry.When I begin laughing I start crying because it is absoutly fuuny.You really think about the days of segration.I highle recommend this for anyone who wants to laugh.
5,A beautiful narrative of the triumph of a family,"The Delaney sisters would have been an asset to any family. Intelligent, wise and warm, their story is one of deep poverty leavened and enlivened by strong family ties, intense moral support, strong religious faith and deep belief in their ability to accomplish their goals. The story is so riveting that it almost seems like fiction. It is a miracle to hear the words of two real women whose lives encompassed nearly the entire 20th Century and a bit of the 19th. Their race is irrelevant: they are astonishing. I have bought six copies of this book so far."
5,"An Amazing Story, it touched my heart!","All I can say is wow! This book was truly an inspiration for me. I learned a piece of my history that I don't often get to hear about from the point of view of people who actually lived it. These women went out there and made a positive contribution to the world and stayed true and honorable to themselves at a time when being black in America was a crime. To know that amid all the turmoil and opression it didn't stop them from getting their degrees and becomming prominant and just plain old good American citizens. My heart is proud...The Delany sisters are truly the ultimate representation of Black America. I suggest anyone interested in American, Women, and Black history (which all coincides anyway)to pick up this book and read it. You'll find pride and strengh in these sister's story."
5,HAVING OUR SAY,"Talking about the Delany Sisters is like talking about history with a tender touch. They are wise, smart,strong and they are an example for minorities to follow. Discrimination, and racism will be around for a long time, I just pray that I have the courage and power to succeed against all odds."
2,Having Our Say,"Having Our Say, a book about two one-hundred year old women, Bessie and Sadie, is overall a good book. The book shows speciic aspects of their lives from each of their perspectives. The book gives you enough detail for you to understand completely and rarely ever goes into excessive detail about one event in their lives. I'm indifferent on this book because I really don't consider it to be a boring book or bad book, although it is not one of the bests bookd i have ever read. I think this is a good book for many people to read because it shows what life was like in the early stages of our century and how things changed through the years in Bessie's and Sadie's life story."
3,BORING!!!!!!,Having Our Say was alright & had it's moments but overall it was boring & took me forever to read & patience not to throw it down & forget about it!!!The history was a bit interesting but this is not my idea of a good book. I didn't realize it was supposed to be a history class.
4,The Best of America,"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years, staring Diahann Carroll and Ruby Dee, was the portrayal of two American women who never married and lived rich full lives. Both women overcame Jim Crow, misogyny, and prejudice and went on to become professional women long before the new Millennium. Carroll and Dee gave wonderful performances, which reminded me of the stellar performance that Cicely Tyson gave in The Autobiography of Ms. Jane Pittman. This film features Mykelti Williamson as Papa Delany, who was a slave and went on to educate himself and raised his girls to be confident, ambitious, and staunchly self-reliant. If you need to be inspired, this film fits the bill. Check it out!"
4,Delany Sisters - A fun and exciting read,"This book starts off slow, but it really is fascinating! It is is such a fun book to read, it is filled with so much information about history but also gives you a glimpse at life in the South during the Reconstruction and through the days of segretation. It really opened my eyes. Great book!"
4,Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters First 100 Years,"It was a wonderful book, well written and easy to read. Very informative. 100 years of african american history that any and everyone can relate to."
4,Having Our Say,I loved this book. Reading about their lives and all the obstacles they overcame showed me a side of life that I didn't know .
3,It's a book,"It's a book, I read it for school, and it has no noticable mistakes in grammer save the quotes."
1,Dreadfully Boring,"This book was absolutely the most boring book I've ever read! The sisters take up about 20 pages just explaining who's who in their family, which was just about the most unbelievably dull experience I've ever had reading. Also, they always manage to sound like they were and are perfect people. It's a great premise for a book, but the story is lost when Bessie and Sadie only speak of what great things they did, and not of what the blacks of that time period did. I love Black History, but this book was an extreme disappointment to me. I'd rather read a school textbook than this book."
4,A Piece of Genuine History,"This is a real look into the history of a black family from the days of slavery until the present. It gives us personal insight into how life was then, the struggle to overcome poverty, and the closeness of a wonderful family. It's hard to put this one down."
4,Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,This was a great book. I love the way the Sisters told history from thier personal experiences. They also showed how even if you live for 100 years or more you learn a little more about your self every day. This books also shows how anyone can achieve anything if they have a strong foundation instilled in them no matter what they incounter or experience. Although I do think at times the sisters were a little condescending and arogant towards other african american who did not have the same upbring as they did. The Delany Sisters were blessed with opportunities many african-americans at that time did not have and were not going to have. I felt they were just a little to judgemental towards them for not having the same quality of life as the Delanys.
4,The ONLY replacement for your NEC LT-30,"This lamp works just fine in my NEC LT30LP Projector! I have had no gribes, minus the cost, but even then I got a bargain from a store called pikespeaklaser. It was something like $330 shipped, if that...Still pricey, but not bad for a 2000 hour lamp"
4,"Good product, but","but I thought it was a complete set (2 of each). My mistake...I had to order a second set to match the first one, so I have a couple of C notes tied up in a set of weights that go up to only 10 lbs. They are of good quality though, and the seller was extremely prompt."
5,Koga Ryu Ninjutsu,"I initially had my doubts but in the end it turned out to be the kind of instructional i could get behind. Juan Hombre of the Banke Shinobinoden school led by Jinichi Kawakami, is head of the Japan Ninjutsu Federation for a reason. The film teaches the important stretches, the kamae, and what the kamae are used for and how to transition. It isn't Bujinkan, because it keeps everything simple and direct, using shadow tactics, a fine quality of Ninjutsu training. Definitely a keeper I say. I wonder if the Iga Ninjutsu DVD he's planning is just as good."
2,Too many errors to be reliable,"This book contains too many errors to consider it as an accurate history of American crime. The corrupt New York City police commissioner, Grover Whalen, is renamed ""Grover Warren"". A picture supposedly showing the murdered gangster Dutch Schultz is really that of one of his henchmen. John Dillinger is shown handcuffed to ""Sheriff Holley"". Unfortunately, the person pictured is a man and the sheriff of Crown Point, Indiana was actually LILLIAN Holley. Those are just a few errors that I caught, and I have no idea how many more are hidden within this book's pages."
3,"Eh...not bad, not good either","I had to see what the fuss was being made about Timo Maas, I must say that I am still scratching my head figuring out why people are making much ado about nothing with this guy. Never in my life have I heard anything more repetitive than this cd. One of the reasons why I don't often buy dj mix cds is because I fear that the music will come up a few cards short of a full deck and will be left disappointed. Disc one is definitely disposable and is considered useless to me. Disc two gets somewhat better but not by much. Definitely not one of my better purchases I've made this year."
3,"Inconsistent, lacked smooth transition","Yet another example of a two disc DJ album where disc 1 leaves you hanging and disc 2 attempts to kiss and make up with you to make the save. Disc 1 moved too quickly from sound to sound. It lacked the smooth transition through sounds that make the greats. There's no feeling in most of disc 1. It brings somewhat of a tacky sound at times. Discs 2 comes back strong to take you for the ride. Yet, not enough to totally rebound from the poor opening act. Peace"
2,Interesting but disappointing,"The DVD contains everything that the editorial review promises but in really poor quality. The DVD disc is a DVD-R that the manufacturer reproduced very cheaply and although the cover says that it is digitally remastered, the quality of the DVD is really quite appalling, being very amateurish and in some parts, simply not watchable. Although the content will make me watch it again, I'm really disappointed that I've had to pay so much for something of such poor quality."
1,Appalling quality,"The quality of this DVD is appalling, and virtually unwatchable. Althought I understand that the footage is old, I had no idea that it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography!It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly, and due to the absence of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breathing cannot be heard.The video is blurry, dark and visually ""noisy"". The funeral scene at the end is so dark, it is difficult to see anything at all.Don't waste your money"
1,Bad Quality,"Although the DVD does show historical footage of Gogen Yamaguchi, the quality is extremely bad. The faces of the practioners cannot be seen and the colour is dark and running."
3,"Rare historic footage, borderline quality","I am a Goju practiotner x 2o years. I believe this video does offer historic footage of Gogen Yamaguchi and you can see him personally perform many of the katas on the Goju Kai curriculum. It is inspiring to see him enter the waterfall too. At the end is footage from the funeral where Sanchin is performed by the group. Also 3 karateka perform Seipai, Suparinpei and Kururunfa simultaneously. The cameraman focuses mostly on the Seipai kata performer. Lastly, Goshi Yamaguchi performs Hakatsuru Kata (I believe this may also be known as the Master's Kata Genkaku). Do not confuse with Shotokan's Gankaku. Unfortunately the quality here is very poor. The narration by Mr Alexander is informative. The content is fantastic. The quality should be a little better. A probably must have for one in the Japanese Goju lineage. There is a paradoxical lack of any published footage from Gogen Yamaguchi after this 1960's reel from one of his training camps. Osu!"
1,poor video quality,"Gogen Yamaguchi video contains only shadows moving in the dark!No resolution, no contrast...looking at the same video on internet is much much better! I bought a DVD!!!!!!!!Completely dissatisfied!!"
5,Very classy,"I totally agree with the other reviewers. This is collection of Christmas favorites is very classy, easy listening. I've had it for many years and still love listening to it."
5,Outstanding,My wife and I LOVE this CD. It's the first Christmas CD we turn on for the season. She picked it up at a grocery store and she says it's the best deal she ever made!
4,Good Book,Very interesting book and very insightful. This is a great book for someone in the social work or any related field.
4,Great Read,This was a book assigned for a social work class and the author known to my professor. The book reads like a autobiographical novel. it follows the life of a young girl caught up in the welfare system and her side of what it is like.
4,A Small Selection of Karpov's Great Games,"This contains 43 games of Karpov, covering 25 years of his career from 1969 to 1994. The games are brilliant, but the book is relatively short. Some of his famous victories, e.g. vs Topalov in Linares 94, are missing. Also notable is that Karpov has White in the vast majority of the selected games."
4,this kicks ass!,"integrity is one of the first bands that really played metalcore. very loud, fast and evil cleveland hardcore.this is a classic album, although it's not their best album (which is 'those who fear tomorrow').the cd contains some cool bonus tracks as well (2 old demos)."
5,Excellent. Long overdue. A must have for Hank fans!,"This one is long overdue to be released. For once, I have an opportunity to compliment Mercury Nashville on a Hank release. You have the complete H & H shows here, folks. This is well worth the buy!"
5,This CD is the bomb!!,Karen really out did herself this time. My favorite song on this CD is God's Will. This CD is for everyone no matter what age category!!
5,simply awesome,"karen's solo project is nothing but the truth, she has really become a great solo artist (TO GOD BE THE GLORY) i relly truly love this project because there is something for everybody who likes different kinds of gospel music may the Lord God continue to Bless Karen real good God Bless tye-wren"
5,"KAREN CLARK-SHEARD,","I would like to say that Karen Clark-Sheard's CD ""Finally Karen"" was a tremendous hit! Listening to her sing reminded me of her late mother,The Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. My favorite song was ""The Will of God"" which features her daughter, Kierra. It was really great hearing her sisters: Elbernita ""Twinkie"", Dorinda, and Jackie singing together. It made me reminence on the old times! I think Karen is the best thing that ever hit the Gospel stage! She has the vocals and the anointing that would save any sinners soul. I know her mother, Mattie Moss Clark is smiling down on her with great dignity! If you have not gotten ""Finally Karen"" I encourage you to do so because If you don't you are missing out on one of the most exilirating performances done by Evangelist Karen Clark-Sheard! I am very proud to have her as a part of the grand ole'CHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST,INC. Emmanuel Institution COGIC you have a jewel as your 1st Lady!"
5,want to do work with you,"this album was unspeakably wonderful. I still play it years later and it brings tears to my eyes. It captured my heart.""God's been Good"" is the song. Karen clarkthat song hit me where I lived. I want to do work with you!"
1,Did not ship!,"My order was placed on 07/23/09. I was notified it shipped on 07/27/09. On 08/12/09 I requested a tracking number as I had not received my order. 08/13/09 I was informed by the shipper it had been shipped but they would ship another and if I received the first one, I was to return it. 09/01/09 I again contacted the shipper for a tracking number and received no response. Finally I requested a full refund and again no response. I ultimately had to contact Amazon to receive the refund which I now have. I would definitely NOT recommend this seller and do not consider them reliable. I am grateful, however, for Amazon's terrific customer service!"
2,Disappointment,"I wanted to like this book. I work in the environmental field and I was thrilled to see a book billed as ""an environmental mystery."" The hero is even an aquatic biologist! And, since I had read a favorable review, I was sure I was in for a good read when I ordered this book.What a disappointment! If there was ever a book desperately in need of a good editor, it is this one. I can only assume that this book must be of the ""self-published"" variety. By the end of the second page, I had an overwhelming urge to whip out my red pen so I could correct the grammar and restructure sentences. I do a lot of writing and editing in my job, so perhaps I'm more sensitive to these things, but after 4 chapters I couldn't take it anymore and I put the book in my ""donate to the library"" pile.Obviously, because this book has received some 5 star reviews, some people aren't bothered by the technical shortcomings of this publication. But, if bad grammar drives you nuts, stay away from this book."
1,A superb book,"I took the analysis and found that McDonald's is a cult. I will no longer eat there as a result. They do not encourage their employees along true Christian lines.Okay, I am kidding. Both the book and some of the reviews look like sniping and backbiting in the world of religious ideological warfare. [...]"
2,Missouri adventures,"I have bought many travel books for Europe. This was my first travel book for somewhere in the midwest. There are lots of good ones for the West Coast but the midwest needs work. This travel book doesn't have enough color pictures, maps, etc. I guess it is a fair starting point. I would not bother. Contact the Missouri Tourism for better guides and maps. They send them to you for free. Much better deal."
4,The Power of Integrity: Building a Life Without Compromise,This falls in line with a teaching received at our church recently. It is always appropriate to remember integrity and follow the leading of The Holy Spirit today when so many people are going awry with self motivation and self inflicted ways of sin that hurt their walk with God and break the heart of Their Only Hope Jesus Christ. God bless the author and all those who take heed and live according to God's Holy ordinances but most of all LOVE Him enough to obey. Pastor Kathy Settles
3,Fair cap,I bought this cap for my MLB collection. The cap was a little larger for my head. This is not adjustable but one size. Thank you.
5,This is a GREAT Cap!,"I have no idea what's wrong with the '1 star' guy. Yeah, it's made in China . . . but so are a lot of other things we purchase in this country. Could the USA make a hat this good? Probably, but right now I am wearing my second LA cap I purchased and it looks and feels great. The first one lasted a little over a year. I do put my baseball caps through a lot of wear and tear. Yes, it's faded and has that 'worn look'. But, that's what we want isn't? You want a great LA Dodger baseball cap or not? Buy it. You want be disappointed."
1,TRASH,"Absolute worst Hat ever.I am a hat collector.This hat is totally flat,totally faded (10 shades lighter than the photo)looks like it came from the bottom of the heap of a grab bag at the salvation army store.It was made in china and, appears to be someone's 10 yr. old pre-owned hat.You will have to line the inside (all the way around) with cardboard to fill it out on your head and to get it to stand up straight when not in use."
2,not happy,"received this product,missing pilot bushing and clutch alignment tool.what good is it without the tool?now my car will be up on jacks till i get the tool,not happy.the picture shows both included, again NOT HAPPY."
1,Out of this world LAMENESS - Avoid this movie,"DVD cover: great and interesting looking artwork. I think 40% of the budget went into making it. Two reviews on the back of DVD case: Lame. One reads, ""It's Alien meets Kramer vs. Kramer"" by Sci-Fi weekly. NO, it is not. Story: Barely interesting, and then the terrible effects kills it. Most of the acting is horrible (which is somewhat entertaining). The story changes gears from the beginning to midpoint, shifting from serious, to some comic relief, then to never ending court scenes. Don't waste your time on this movie. Maybe the book is interesting, but the movie was unveiled out of this world lameness."
2,SCI-FI LAW AND ORDER,"STAR TREK's Walter Koenig penned this movie which plays more like an episode of LAW AND ORDER than a sci-fi/horror flick. Unfortunately, it's as exciting as watching drapes fade.The creature is horribly done and amateurish. Richard Hatch is awful and Koenig is worse! The dialogue and direction are bad and the whole cast is ineffective. Koenig drives his point of ""equal rights"" with a heavy hammer but doesn't entirely pull it off.Better acting and creature effects might have made a better flick, but this misfire doesn't make the grade."
2,"Nice Idea for a movie , but coyuld have done more","This movie isn't bad, alitle longer than it should be. It could have done more with the alien creature than it did. It is slow in parts and is a good idea for movie but i wished it had more action in it than it did. It's worth watching when you can't find anything else to watch."
1,Color enhancing? You've got to be kidding!,"A steady diet of this caused my goldfish to lose color. And I don't mean a little. I mean she went from being a gorgeous red and orange to shock white. Other goldfish in my tank also started losing colors. After inspecting the ingredients, trying to figure out the problem, I discovered it's full of fillers, and more importantly lake colors. A lake color will only disperse in oil, sucrose, or alcohol. It's also the same stuff you find in your makeup. What do you think that does to a poor fish's digestive system? I will never buy this again. Oh, and that color change issue with my goldfish? 1 year later, on a good frozen pure food diet, the white goldfish is still white, and the ones who lost some of their color, never did regain it."
3,Let them eat lobster,"Hmm, my outdoor pond goldfish like it, as well they should as this comes out to $36/lb, more than lobster.So, what to do? Buy and grind up fish and wheat germ and whatever else is on the label? Nothing motivates my fish like mosquito larvae, but living amongst those evil bloodsuckers is more than I want to do.Oh, well, I'll just get whatever seems to be the best deal at the time and maybe the herons and egrets and racoons will live a better life near the top of the food chain. They seem to like fish that have been fed expensive food."
2,Just okay fish food,"With Goldfish food it is important to soak it in water before giving it to them. Otherwise, they can get air bubbles trapped within their bodies. With this band of goldfish food it just laid on top of the water for several minutes. I would not purchase this brand again."
3,Too Educational,"I agree with the other reviews, that the author is very competent in his knowledge of plants. I found the format somewhat like a textbook, with the pictures separate from the plant descriptions a somewhat displeasing feature. Statements are too brief and too technical to be really beneficial to a new gardner. Also use of zones was infrequent and almost nonexistent. I find that a must in choosing plant material."
2,Southern Living Garden Book,"The book was not as advertised. While it was used and still usable, the spine was broken. This is disappointing."
4,Great Resource,"This book was recommended to me by a recently divorced lady who knew that I was preparing to start a ""Divorce Care"" support group at my church -- an independant Christian church. I found it to be an excellent book with many comforting thoughts and practical suggestions for those experiencing the tragedy of divorce. The book is clearly of great value to non-Catholics as well as Catholics. It is sprinkled with useful scriptural references but contains only minimal information which would be useful to Catholics only, i.e., some brief comments on the annulment process as practiced by the Catholic Church and an example of the value of confession as relates to the person's role in a failed marriage. Of particular value are guidelines for consideration when considering remarriage."
5,To be divorced and Catholic this is a good read !,Since becoming divorced I have found so much wonderful helpful books to be available. This book goes right on along with most of them. To find a book that deals with such an overwhelming emotional ride and have that be presented to you at a Catholic approach is great. The book is simple and I considered it an uplifting read.
1,Very disturbed with this book,"This book was a complete waste of money for me. Not only that, but I didn't even feel right about reselling it, so I threw it away. The author picked apart the Old Testament, saying the gospels are the only part of the bible to believe. He also talked about ""Hell"" as being a ""realm"" where the spirits of people who died were full of hate. He did not mention the fact that there is a real hell with fire, anguish and complete separation from God awaiting those who do not accept Jesus as their savior. He also said many other things that were way off. I have heard so many stories of after death experiences that all agreed, making them believable. However, his description wasn't even similar to the others. I was very disappointed."
4,A needed glimpse of reality,"I had read Dr. Ritchie's first book, ""Return from Tomorrow"", many years ago and recently found it again. Then I discovered this second book through Amazon. I recall my Dad, also a physician, telling the big news in 1943 of Dr. Ritchie, then Pvt. Ritchie coming back to life from an adrenaline injection into the heart. He writes from the perspective of a Psychiatrist. This book gives more detail about the total realm of our soul's condition that is discoverable after death. His insight is different from Dr. Eby or Marvin Ford, or Rev. Don Piper's experience in the state beyond this life. It augments our understanding of man's current condition and opens horizons of hope for the restoring redemption of mankind."
2,not recommended,"Although this author's story is fascinating, I feel his conclusions may lead some people astray....or cause them great fear, especially if they have lost a loved one to alcoholism or other addictions. The thought that some people's spirits are in limbo, still craving whatever they were addicted to even after they die, is not Biblical. Some of the Lord's children are addicted, but I believe they are freed after they return to Him, just as are the ones who might have been in great suffering from cancer or other things before their death. At the beginning of the book, I really liked it but by the end, I had a very ""yukky"" feeling about this book and even threw it away, did not want it in my house."
4,A little dissapionting,"earth crisis put this cd out right after thier firestorm and all out war ep's they were great and i really was hoping for this to be an amazing cd. but they tried to sound like all the other bands on victory. after a while the songs grow on you a little, but if you want good cd's get tier new ones or thier old ep's"
1,I'd give it no stars if I could.,"Musically, this is uncompelling, muddy metal. If the kids want to call this ""hardcore,"" fine, but it's metal, straight-up, and not even good metal.Lyrically, this album is a disgrace. Earth Crisis, and a number of other ""hardline"" S.E. bands, have taken a positive idea -- straight edge -- and warped it into negative, hyper-judgemental, violent non-sense. Admittedly, there has always been a hardline element in SE, but these clowns go way overboard. What's the difference between Earth Crisis' ""philosophy"" and that of evangelical zealots who bomb abortion clinics? Very little, as far as I can tell.Straight edge is not about telling other people what to do, and threatening them with violence if they don't acquiesce. It's about thinking for yourself and living by reason, not rules."
1,Think hard.....,"and try to picture that smell that hits your nose when you walk into a public bathroom in say a gas station on the side of the highway, somewhere in new jersey. Now if you could collect that smell, bottle it, bring it to a lab somewhere and transfer it into music.... your result would be none other than, Earth Crisis. not just this album, every one of them. From the annoying guitar tones, to the repeating riffs, to the rediculous preaching, Earth Crisis produces music that only someone with tourette's syndrome would bounce their head to, and thats because they have no choice. The lyrics would make the happiest man want to kill himself, just to get away from that vexatious wretching. Buy this cd at your own risk, though I strongly recommend that you spend an extra few dollars on some really good earplugs, you are going to need them, in fact maybe an icepick so you can just stab your eardrums. you'll thank me later."
4,Militant Vegan Straightedge,"It ain't hardcore, but if you need to know what's happening to our planet or our morality, these guys will tell it to your face."
5,super charger,"great for multiple batteries, don't have to wait on one to charge any more.works for me with 2 14.4 and 1 18 volt drills"
1,Milwaukee Multi-Bay Charger catches fire in home,"I owned this product for only 1 month before it decided to catch FIRE in my basement. Fortunately, the house didn't burn down thanks to the quick response from the fire department. There will be NO MILWAUKEE PRODUCTS (CORDED or CORDLESS) in my home. THANKS FOR NOTHING MILWAUKEE!"
3,Good but not the best,"I received the storage cabinet in a damaged box and some parts were partly damaged or holes not perforated, so I had to make the openings myself. Despite those shortcomings, the cabinet is standing now and holding all the weight I put in (and I mean serious weight...) another disappointment of mine was the fact that the interior is not as wide as you wold expect from the advertised measurements. The tubing takes considerable space inside the cabinet."
3,disappointed,Not very happy with product. Did not fit together well and directions were not very clear. After buying other Rubbermaid products with no problems this purchase was definately inferior to others. Will think twice before buying Rubbermaid again
4,ok rubbermaid cabinet,"This cabinet is an ok cabinet. But not the quality I expected from Rubbermaid. It comes in a huge box. There are no written instructions, only pictures which are printed on the side of that box. (we cut the box open, moved the pieces inside the house, & cut the instructions side of the box off to put it together inside) The instructions definitely could be clearer. The pieces have holes & joints which fit & lock together. (the machine used to cut the holes in the plastic did a sloppy job. They were a little irregular.) Once the cabinet is assembled, it does seem stable & secure. Overall, I am happy with this cabinet. It suits my needs just fine. There is a place where you can place a lock to secure the items inside. A child protection lock would also work there if needed."
5,Great addition to outdoor kitchen project.,"I purchased this cabinet to create an outdoor kitchen for my husband. Prior to this purchase, all of his cookware was stored in storage containers/tubs. He is excited that he doesn't have to bend anymore or guess which container holds his rib racks. It was like having a birthday party as he found stuff he forgot he had available to him. The cabinet is durable as I would expect from Rubber Maid and having the assembly instructions printed on the back is genius."
3,cabinet,"good strong enclosed cabinet with shelving.the only problem was that 1 door lacked the appropriate drill holes in order to assemble....i had to cut holes...not easy....and not acceptable, given the price and rubbermaid reputation."
1,Terrible,Every box was damaged and when opened were used and broken by someone before and just retapped in the box. When you order something new it should be new.
3,Design needs some work.,"I had high hopes for this cabinet, and I bought the 4 door model as well. It went together easily enough, but when it was completely together, (and I followed the instructions to the letter) the doors did not exactly line up. They do close, but it would look much nicer if they were in proper alignment. The four door model did not seem to have this problem. It's just for the garage, but, still, I would have liked to see a better alignment of the doors."
2,Disappointing,"Not the build-quality you would expect from Rubbermaid; definitely spend your money on something else. UPS delivered this package with their usual finesse - smashed, dented, and broken in a couple places. It is easy to build - no tools needed; and no screws, etc. But the doors do not line up, and the unit really does not 'finish' well. The tubes used to hold the unit together have no cover on top - so I suspect it will fill up with garage gook over time. Costco sells a similar-type unit for a third less of the price and the build seems superior. My two cents here!"
5,Met All Expectations; Am Very Happy; Buying Another One,"I am SO happy with this cabinet. I ordered it, it showed up, I put it together and life is good in the garage. While putting it together required some tugging to get the pieces to fit, all I needed was a rubber mallet, a little muscle power, and it came together very nicely. It looks good and holds bottles and other items very nicely. I'm amazed with the amount of room that's available in this cabinet as compared to what I used before. In fact, I am going to buy another one."
2,Disappointed in the quality of this product,"We recently purchased this product and expected to find the kind of quality we have experienced from Rubbermaid in the past. As we began the assembly, it became clear that some pieces still had small, loose pieces rattling around inside them or still attached. Fortunately, we had a rubber mallet because assembly would have been impossible without the use of that tool. There were no printed instructions, only the pictures on the box where no parts were identified by letter. The 15 minute assembly time was not accurate. It took two adults about 45 minutes."
1,disappointed in Rubbermaid storage cabinet,Very sloppily made kit and over priced. To put it together should have been a thirty minute job but took two hours because we had to trim all the holes. Would not recommend to a friend.
1,displeased,"Missing shelves,received 5 grated shelves no soild shelves.Amazon is going to give discount I want missing parts.I would not recommend this product until the manufacture ships/corrects the shelving issue.The shipping box shows two soild shelves and three grated shelves.I ended up with five grated shelves.Not good for outside storage."
2,Disappointed,"When fully assembled,not only did the doors not lineup correctly,but they were difficult to open. It appears that the holes were not drilled correctly and so the doors were misaligned. For almost $200,we expected a better product."
5,Great little shed,"I bought this to use under my carport to store garden supplies. It fits in a corner and is out of the way. The shelves are sturdy. The doors are a bit crooked (as another reviewer noted) and thus a bit too snug. But what do you expect for the price? It is near perfect for me. And for the price, it is perfect. Unfortunately the assembly instructions were all on the outside of the box and the shipping label covered up a vital step. But I guessed correctly and had it together in no time."
4,Rubbermaid Cabinet Review,"Very sturdy and nice looking, only complaint is hinges are noisy and hard to open on some. Would still recommend it though."
5,Great Cabinet,Bought this for my barn to store our horse care products in. It is durable and can lock easily. Very pleased with this product.
5,"storage cabinet, good buy","This cabinet works great and was worth the purchase it was also easy to assemble.I would strongly reccommend this product, we do not have it in a rainy outdoor area it is under a patio area."
5,Just Right,The storage cabinet is just what we wanted. The description was right on. It is sturdy and easy to assemble. Amazon had the best price of all. We are very happy:)
2,The Rubbermaid High Quality Reputation has taken a plummet folks!,"Not impressed. Rubbermaid use to be Tougher than this. The quality seems to be the same as those cheaper brands now. No Differece. I would go to a Lowes Home Improvement, Home Depot or Sears and buy something from them for LESS. The quality is the same! Rubbermaid used to be tougher, but the High Quality is NOT there any more. How sad is that? Very sad for me because I spent extra money for quality that I did not get. The Rubbermaid High Quality Reputation has taken a plummet folks! Oh well. Learn from my advice."
4,"well built , but QC missed something","This is a well built and easy to assemble storage that is actually made in the US!!!!!!! It is very sturdy and will hold oh so many items. The doors are stiff opening and closing but I imagine they will wear in in time and not be so stiff.The only think wrong with this is that their quallity control missed that one of the doors had no holes made in it for the hinge type insertion of the pole. We muddled through and was able to make the holes ourselves but that should not have been missed and made the assembly take so much longer than it should have. There also were no instructions in the box, I had to search online for assembly instructions to print out. Other than that I am ver pleased with this.I want to mention too that the shelving is not solid except for the bottom shelf. The shelving has a grid like in it, maybe for ventilation among the shelves??"
2,"smashed sides and backs in the box, poor, thin, areas","I was quite shocked at the cheapness of the manufacturing. Almost all of the side and back pieces have to slide over the poles and the majority of the openings were smashed, bent and very thin. I have always turned to Rubbermaid but will not in the future. Too late to return it. It is together and I have recycled the box. I will caulk every area I can and hope that it stays together.very disappointed. $260.00 is not the amount I would have paid for that lack of quality!I ordered another rubbermaid tool shed the same day and that one was perfect and much more protected in shipping. No damage at all. I hate writing bad reviews but I would suggest you take it apart and inspect each piece before you begin."
3,Does the job for me but...,"Priced about $100.00 more than it should be. Easy to put together though I agree with the others that the finish could be much better on this product. I was expecting much better at this price point. C+ finish at best. The cut outs were not clean nor straight, however this does not cause an assembly problem and it is hard to notice once unit is assembled. Again agree with many others that the doors don't swing open cleanly, but for my purposes of utilitarian storage, this is not a deal breaker. I will be the only one using this; it will store my pool chemicals under an outdoor overhang. If the durability holds up, I would consider raising to 4 stars, but thats as high as I would go. It could be a solid B, especially if the price drops below $175. Time will tell. The packing was a joke/there was none. Luckily there was no damage. Not sure I could recommend this product given the above review. Would have to review with caveats."
4,Good overview for a 96 page book,"This Osprey book, like so many in the series, provides a good overview of the topic for those who only have an hour or two to spare on reading about it.The book starts off with, and does a fairly good job, at presenting the context of the battle from both the strategic (from perspective of Allied WWII strategy) and operational perspectives, the forces involved, commanders involved, strategies of both sides, the combat history as it unfolded and the consequences of the battle. All done fairly well in only 96 pages.One weakness of the book, however, is that it does not have color plates of typical equipment and troops used in the campaign. This is unlike most other Osprey books in this series. It also does not have a very good descritpion of the equipment and troops involved. Hence four stars instead of five."
5,Essential JW Reading,This is essential reading for all Jehovah's Witnesses. This is the last publication written before Jesus' 1919 decision that the (then) Bible Students would be his chosen people! This book is surely what convinced him. See the Revelation Climax book's references to this book as one of the most important publications in human history!
1,mistaken for the textbook,I purchased this in the belief that it was the textbook.It wasnt.It has nice pictures but are kind of useless.
2,Earth Portrait of a Planet,As I never received the book it would be impossible to review it. I now have a claim in against the seller.
4,Fruit jars,"The book is helpful when identifying the desireable jars, but it is outdated as far as values! It is an acceptable guide to buying though."
4,Shifting Sentiments,"Generations of the Cazalet family plod through the frightening currents of WWII in England. The bombing and war work seem to reach a ""normalcy"" and the (huge!) cast of characters muddle through life as it has now become. Goals necessarily must shift; rationing and grim food is a constant irritation; but love and life experiences do go on. The author realistically, but not unkindly, portrays the muddles in personal relationships. The Reader should be warned: this book ends on quite a cliff hanger. You'll want Book IV handy for uninterrupted enjoyment."
1,Drivel,"This is one of the worst books on this topic that I have ever read. It is not well written, is hard to follow, and is so far out in left field that I couldn't finish it. I'm ashamed to say I even bought the book. The author needs to do some current research on the subject. This is a terrible book and I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,tight Jams by Cameo,"when Cameo first came out they brought some tough funk too the party.jams like ""Rigor Mortis"" are smoking cuts that any party could feel the power of the Groove from start too finish."
4,Energy,The Emergen-C Heart Health Black Cherry really helps to boost your energy levels before a workout or when you need a pick me up when you are feeling sluggish or right after your exercise. I recommend this product to others.
4,Worth it in hindsight,"This book started off a slow and tedious read, but eventually became a page-turner. In the end, though the subject matter seemed dated (or at least small-town), the characters came alive, and the story was worth reading. The book was all the more enjoyable for it lack of violence, sex and profanity."
5,A great story of undying love between a special family,"I just finished this book, wishing it would never end. I found found this story to be sad but extremely moving. I recommend it to everyone! It has now become my favorite book. I fell in love with each and every character. I felt as though they were my mothers' too! I enjoyed the writer's style very much. She has touched my heart in a way I will never forget."
2,The content is very powerful.,"Although the synopsis of the novel was very powerful, Lowell's writing style was lacking. His communication was difficult to understand and follow. He continually jumps from one point in time to another. I enjoyed the ideas of the book immensly, yet I found it a diffcult read."
5,Zip Tie Gun,This gun by far is over the top. It sure beats all the plastic ones I have bought over the years. This is an XLNT must have product for any guy that is a handy man. I love this gunh. I don't leave home without it. Thank you. Well done.
3,Not enough,"This tool worked OK but was not capable of creating enough tension for my purposes. It cuts the tie at about 50 pounds of pressure, I needed close to 100 pounds."
2,Works well but way overpriced for what it does,"Item works as advertised but honestly, you can tighten these things down by hand, cut the extra with a scissor and save yourself $40. Unless you need the cable ties really tight, you don't really need this thing. By the way, if you do tighten down all the way with this tool, when you go to take the cable tie off later, it can be difficult to do without cutting or scraping the material that was bound together (in my case, Cat6 ethernet cables)."
5,Serious Tool,"I own several of the cheaper plastic versions of this tool. All I can say is this is the last stop for this kind of tool. It's well-thought out and well-made. It has an adjustable wheel at the bottom that allows you to adjust the tension at which you want the cable tie to bundle your wires at. I have mine on the ""1"" setting and it bundles the wires very snuggly. Anything more than that would be overkill for me and I like overkill. It grips the tail of the cable tie tightly and it never slips like it does on the cheaper plastic version. Another neat feature is that this tool will cut the tail of the cable tie automatically after the the cable tie has been cinched. This occurrs without having to twist the gun to cut the tail like I have to with the cheaper plastic versions. Highly recommended."
3,"Wonderful content, flawed delivery","I have a strong love/hate relationship with this book. I use it daily, and it holds place of honor on my desk, for it CONTAINS everything you need to know about ColdFusion.But USING it is another matter. This volume would be far more usable had the book design team realized they were publishing a reference book. There are no page headers, so readers must fumble through pages looking for entries, some of the starting a mere 4 lines from the bottom of the page. Buy it, and use it. And weep."
4,a good place to start for Crowbar newcomers,"this is a good Crowbar retrospective that covers their whole career up to their Equilibrium album. the only complaint I have is that it completely skips over their Broken Glass album. a few years ago when all their older albums were re-issued on Spitfire records, I never really understood why the Broken Glass album wasn't included. maybe there were licencing disagreements with the original label. who knows... for the most part it is still a good sampler of all (or most) of their albums from the kings of New Orleans doom-sludge-metal."
1,Might want to avoid this one,"First of all let me say that I have a had good success with MRM products in the past but this pregnenolone product is not one of them. I have had very strange heart palpitations while using it. It frightend me to the point where I quit using it after just one week. Like I a said, MRM is a good company with good products but their pregnenolone is not one of them. A pregnenolone supplement from a different brand may be a better route."
5,Perfectly lovely,"This is one of my favourite Hardy novels. As some others have noted, it's not one of the ""big 5"" but certainly worth reading. Hardy's descriptions of the woodlands are beautiful, and I found the ending to be one of his most unpredictable. I wouldn't recommend reading it if you are feeling down, as the ending is sooooo wonderfully tragic (hehe), or if you're not a fan of Hardy's prose style, but otherwise it's a wonderful read. Very personal as well. I got the feeling it was written just for me :)"
2,"Ooh arr, ooh arr. So that's what simple folk do.","Hardy has unaccountably won classic status by writing arcadian clap trap. The setting is bizarre, and not his own, the time similarly, the characters two dimensional and at times grossly irrational - they done fings differnt then - and the plot wearisome. It's like Monty Python and the Holy Grail meets Neighbours- without the class."
4,The Hidden Image,Dr. Garza-Valdes puts together facts and beliefs and produces an account of what could have happened to a historic painting. It is very interesting to read about the intrigue and history of one work of art. The good Doctor does a nice job of leading the reader through the facts and establishing his theory. I would reccommend it to everyone.
4,Good But Gets Old,This program is good for the non-famous singers or people tryin to have fun with music. I bought this program because I was a music starter but it doesnt have enough sounds to make a whole cd or even a couple songs. So now I am getting a real studio. But if you dont want to spend alot of money but want quality songs get Magix Hip-Hop Maker.
4,"Great Samples, Poor Program","I purchased this program when it first came out. To be honest with you, the program itself [stinks]. It is hard to view the samples that you have used in a composition. The samples themselves are wonderful though. They are of high quality. I have used these samples in other programs that I have and have created a number of tracks that are really good."
2,Accutire Digital Tire Gauge,"I ordered this gauge to replace a defective Roadgear gauge that did not read correctly. This gauge came with two dead batteries. The LED would not light and the display would not register pressure. I removed the batteries and found that one battery was in stalled correctly but the second battery (CR2032) was installed backwards. I checked both batteries with a mete and one battery was +1.66V (instead of 3V) and the other was -0.91 volts. I checked the accuracy of this gauge and it's pretty much right on with three other gauges, one of which has been calibrated recently. I'm still considering returning this one too, I should not have to buy new batteries for a brand new gauge."
2,Not worth the price of admission.,"I like the fit & finish of this tire pressure gauge, and the large backlit display is excellent. The small built-in LED light is nearly useless unless you plan to air up your tires in the pitch black night. If there is a streetlight or a flashlight within 50 yards of your vehicle, the LED light is rendered useless.The rubber cover over the measuring end slides forward every time you press the gauge onto the valvestem, which is about 3 to 4 times per tire because the gauge does not contact the valve stem very well. I tried holding it several different ways and only 1 in 4 pressure checks were successful. The remainder of the time I either got 00.0 psi or about 20 psi, which is 15 to 20 psi below what I know the tires to have.I would not buy this product again. The sheath it came in is fantastic, though, and probably where about 45% of the purchase price went. Oh well. I'll use it for about a year or two then probably throw it into the dumpster in frustration."
2,"The ""Lifetime"" Battery is NOT replaceable","The lithium battery is NOT replaceable.Checking my tires every few months for five years depleted the battery. Somewhat short of a ""lifetime"".This refers to the prior model, ""Accutire MS-4000"" which appears identical to this ""Accutire MS-4004b"".http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AXI4/ref=oss_productIt worked well while it lasted."
4,Very functional,This usint was as advertised and more than meets expectations. Th lighted display makes it so much easier to read at night.
2,Mediocre,"Batteries died after a year, not dependable because 1 year just isn't enough especially when you need it. Batteries were a major pain to replace. Have to hold it just right to create a good seal. Hard to read LCD at night. Going back to old school large dial gauges."
5,LOVE LUKE PERRY!!!,"LOVE THESE MOVIES........LUKE PERRY IS AMAZING AND WE CANNOT WAIT TO BUY THE NEXT, SERIES OF 3 ONE. I HOPE HE MAKES EVEN MORE OF THEM, BECAUSE WE NEED MORE GREAT WESTERNS WITH GREAT ACTORS.....BOUGHT ALL OF THESE FOR MY HUSBAND'S CHRISTMAS......HE WILL BE MORE THAN PLEASED!!!"
2,"Same old, same old","I didn't find anything new or very insightful in regards to children's messages in this book, save your money."
4,I've got some kind of fungus on my feet,"This album makes me want to walk, not run, a marathon. There's nothing jarring about Tourist, but somehow it makes you want to stand up and say, ""Man, I wish I were wearing pants."" The song Tourist is a rousing anthem that, if you don't like it, I don't think we are going to be friends."
5,I'm Wired!!,"`Tourist' is the sophomore set from UK indie rock quartet Athlete. Their sound is somewhat like a blend of Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Keane, and Radiohead.I fell in love with their brilliant single `You got style' from their debut. When I heard the brilliant single `Wires', I knew I had to get this CD. It is a sweeping melancholic ballad featuring an achingly yearning vocal performance from lead singer Joel Pott, surging orchestration, and filled with static effects and distorted sounding guitars against a piano/string backdrop. Reportedly recorded for his sick infant. Definitely one of my top songs of this year!The uptempo `Half light' incorporates electronic bleeps and a catchy Britpop sound. There's the melodic `Tourist', and the stirring, string drenched ballad `Chances' with pensive lyrics about seizing chances while you can.`If I found out' is a sweeping epic and an almost gospel feel from the lyrics, and the backing choir. Moving and great!A great addition to any music collection."
4,"A good listen, but nothing special","This is a decent, well-produced album that is very enjoyable Indie pop. But, while there's nothing exactly wrong with it, it really doesn't have anything new or interesting going for it. I found myself saying ""Wow, this really sounds like _____ or _____"" rather than picking up on anything truly original. Emotionally, there's very little to connect with with, and the musicianship is competent, not brilliant. Buy Snow Patrol first, then this album, and plan to have forgetten about it by 2006."
2,Disappointment,"It's not that I was expecting a great CD, but a worthwhile one (since I'd inspected all samples I could previously). Unfortunately, the seller I bought it from (The Last Cinema) decided to send me a CD which, despite sending a extra jewel case as a replacement to shut me up after the fact, had a section chunk gouged out of a ""new"" CD, fails to let me completely enjoy the album since the seller(s) falsified their advertisements. In short, an okay CD shipped by a company that obviously has zero real integrity. Enjoy! (PS Don't buy stuff from The Last Cinema unless you wanna be ripped off, for obvious reasons.)"
4,Assistant in my desk,"As a young, new manager in the aerospace buisness, I am handed many a book by my wiser, more experienced associates to read and apply. This book has been a wonderful asset to me on both day to day and long term efforts. It is straight forward with excellent, useful tools that can be applied immediatly. I recommend this to other managers just starting out who still have there ""common sense."""
4,Want to win! check this book out.,"If your looking for easy to understand and uncomplicated methods to manage and lead a business this book does a good job. I like the practical application of exercises, checklists, forms that address the day to day issues I face. Why reinvent the wheel when this book makes it possible to apply the authors knowledge and hit the ground running everyday."
2,Not the best of the Pirate's Booty line,"I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here."
4,"Great Fun, Great Taste, and Healthy!","Hey, a fun booty for your pirates! This is a fairly healthy choice in snacks! And the taste is great too! Argh. Get some. Argh."
2,BAD GIRLS (plus one) GONE BADDER!,"A sleeper. One really bad girl, and four of her wantabe bad girl friends, who are held over during Easter week at their Catholic girls school, discover a book of spells in a church renovation and decide to give them a try. Of course, the have to enlist the help of the only good girl to translate it from latin (makes a good case for doing your homework doesn't it?). It's good girl against the baddies as they try to open the gates of hell.After a few sexy scences in the first half, the film mostly lacks action until the last twenty minutes or so. A taught score during the climax (so to speak) and some moments of rather inspired acting/directing are not enough to save it however. Too bad - this could have been a much better film, and the viewer is left wondering at the end just what the heck happened.B"
1,Disappointing rip off of The Craft,"I got out this film, hoping it would be really good! Oh dear - what a huge disappointment! The film just seemed to re-work the whole storyline of The Craft - good versus evil, except it was well-done in The Craft. The lead girl, in Little Witches seemed to be a carbon copy of Nancy from The Craft. The rest of the girls weren't any better. This movie sucked badly - my advice? Rent/buy The Craft instead!"
1,T&A only redeming quality,This movie was incredibly boring and it made no sense. Don't waste your money. It's only slight point of interest were the few short scenes that featured breif nudity.
1,THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!,"If you are looking for a stupid, cheesy movie... you found it! Therrible acting, plot, and overall movie. There is no one you will recognize except maybe for Clea Duvall ( She was in THE FACULTY and GIRL, INTERRUPTED). There are some scenes taht will make you want to throw up with pity for whover has seen and whoever made this god awful movie!"
1,HATED THIS MOVIE!,"This movie was the cheesiest, stupidest film ever to be created. It was terrible acting, a weak plot, and scenes that made you want to throw up, not from gore but from pity. The only person you might recognize in the movie is Clea Duvall, who was in THE FACULTY and GIRL, INTERRUPTED. But other than that, not one single person in the movie is worth metioning. Don't waist your time on this stupid movie!"
1,THE GIRL COULDN'T DANCE,"Well, I must say that this is a terrible film. I only saw it because a friend of mine gave it to me (along with Kids which is actually quite good) as a gag gift for Christmas. He told me that the acting was horrible (and it is), that in a pointless stripping scene the girl couldn't dance (and she can't), but there's a lot of pointless nudity and the bad acting is funny (which is also true). Me and my friend are movie addicts and we don't plan on ever sobering up. I find that this movie is just sorta fun to watch in-between serious movies. And I found something intriguing about an overweight girl in a nude scene...you dont really get to see that much. A cheap rip-off of the Craft and an insult to viewers....but it could be fun to make fun of with some friends in a Mystery Science Theatre vein...this would be MST3K after dark though."
1,Only worth seeing for Clea DuVall's debut.................,"This movie was incredibly bad. I cannot believe that the director was female - there was too much pointless and gratuitous nudity within the film. I mean, did we really want to see Sheeri Rapaport completely naked? Especially if this film was supposed to be a 'chick flick' - an amateur porn film more like! I remember watching this, and thinking that DuVall was the only actress worth watching, and that hopefully she would go on to bigger and better things. Believe me, she has. Check her out in The Faculty, and the upcoming Girl, Interrupted and The Astronaut's Wife."
1,Pointless Nudity,This movie wasbad. i mean bad. I dont understand the nudity in the movie it was pointless. The girl cant dance. I dont understand why they would show a naked fat girl dancing around a ring of fire. Clea what was she thinking.
2,Terrible,This movie was bad. Bad acting and a bad script. The nudity in the movie was pointless. THe whole dancing sceen was a joke. Who coreographed this movie.
1,What on earth was this?,"The beginning was quite sexy and so was the lead girl. I believe her name was Jamie. It was such a silly plot and a really bad, unrealistic story line. And there was this one blonde girl in the group and she wasn't in some scenes but she was always there and she never said anything. That really bothered me Overall, the movie was entertaining in most scenes but some of them you have to fast forward out of pure boredom."
2,Is it real?,"Escada for Men is one of the best colognes I have ever used. And while this one smells very good, I am very suspect as to whether it is real or fake. I have been told that the correct logo for Escada is the back-to-back uppercase ""Es"" on the bottle, and that the smaller curved ""e's"" facing each other on the bottle would indicate the product is not really Escada. That's what I got. I thought perhaps I was wrong, so I called the retail distributor directly just to hear what they had to say. Instead of an explanation, I got a very nasty, curt ""customer service"" rep, who said they sell what their supplier provides to them--but that I could return it for a refund. When I explained that I really didn't want to do that, but did want some reassurance that the product was, indeed, Escada, the customer rep got even nastier and refused to talk anymore. So, what would anyone think by this response?"
2,You get what you pay for,"It took me 3hrs to finally decide on this scent. I purchased one bottle from a store at the mall and loved it.A few days ago I accidentally dropped the bottle and had to order a new one. Decided against going to same retailer to save some $$ and ordered one from Amazon.When the package arrived - the bottle and packaging all seemed original, but was I disappointed when I opened the bottle...The cologne had a vague scent of the one I had previously owned, but greatly overpowered by some cheap additive. The difference in smell was evident from very first time when you open the bottle. And the cheap smell doesn't go away.Lesson learned - if you want a quality product - buy from reputable dealer.Edit: Amazon CS was great and refunded me the money. Thank you, Amazon."
2,Not everything by a long shot,"This book covers more than the basics, but doesn't really cover as much as the title claims. Also, it is categorized in an odd manner which makes it difficult to find information."
4,Jazz Shoes,"Capezio dance shoes are one of the best brands that I would recommend for anyone who is a dancer. If one needs dance shoes of any kind, Capezio makes a large variety to choose from. I have had many types of dance shoes, and I have to say that these are the best that I have ever tried."
1,Did not work,"Im sorry but i had to send it back ,it didnt work,waiting for repayment,will buy the same one and try it again...."
5,Excellent photography! Great book for kids!,This book is one of the nicest books I have found for children on the Titanic. The pictures are beautiful and it's nice to have an early reader book that is non-fiction.
2,Bar hurt going through ear,"I found that the bar on these earrings hurt going through my ear. This seems to be a problem with earrings from this company. Also, the silver seemed dull. They were very good about giving me a prompt credit for the return."
4,Stain Away Is Better,"Better than tablets, but not as good as Stain Away. Half the price, though. Hard to rinse off, but partials do come out clean."
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this product, and its a great value. I use it for my retainers. And, my parents use it for their dental appliances. It works much better than the tablet cleansers or just using toothpaste!"
4,Good Product,This is the only product my husband uses. It is hard to find in our area. that is why I purchase online.
3,Buy with caution!,"I purchased this link along with 4 others. This one is very nice as are the others that match what I actually ordered. The company, however, sent one incorrect link and was completely unwilling to admit the error or to rectify the error. I was only able to get a refund after filing a claim with Amazon. I do not recommend purchasing anything from Pugster, but if you do buy with extreme caution."
5,Pink Floyd at their best,Nothing gets better then playing under the sun. Throught this video a fan can get a good look at the intimate side of Pink Floyd. Watching David Gilmour eyeing Roger Waters for changes and seeing Nick Mason lose a stick and hold the timing is more than any fan could ask for. A must have for the avide collector of Floyd Merch.
5,a lost rock documentary masterpiece,"Note that this review refers to the original, I have not seen director's cut.This movie offers a rare inside glimpse at Pink Floyd in full freakdom. It is particularly poignant because it includes clips of floyd recording dark side of the moon, which was to jettison them to permanent stardom. But here you can see them play older psychedelic masterpieces as well as interviews with the band. As always, the band is contrary to most of their peers with their heavy psychedelic approach (and, based on a few of the interviews -- usage!) and intelligent if eccentric rants. A MUST for fans."
5,Absolute Best Pink Floyd Video!,"This video truely touched me. I absolutely love every minute of it. Even though it is pre-Dark Side, it shows clips of studio sessions for it. It has several clips of them fussing a bit, and shows the ever-so-popular Nick Mason ""crust hating"" thing. If I had to give up all my Floyd videos but one, Live At Pompeii would be the one I would keep!"
3,GOOD VERSION OF EARLY FAVORITES,"THIS EARLY FLOYD VIDEO GRABS THE ESSENCE OF THE BAND BEFORE SOME OF IT'S SKYROCKETING FAME. EXCELLENT VERSIONS OF ECHOES,ONE OF THESE DAYS...,AND SET THE CONTROLS...;HOWEVER,THE EXCERPTS OF DARK SIDE OF THE MOON STUDIO RECORDING SESSIONS ARE TOO BROKEN UP AND MAKE YOU CRAVE FULL- VERSION RECORDINGS! STILL A MUST FOR ANY DIEHARD FLOYD FAN. (THE BAND SHOWN IN IT'S EARLY(YOUNG!)STAGES WITH YOUTHFUL ,LONG-HAIRED MEMBERS GIVES YOU THE THRILL OF FOND MEMORIES OF OUR OWN CRAZED ADOLESCENCE. THANK YOU FLOYD!"
5,Awesom,Gives a good overview of how the band Pink Floyd works without an audience. Shows them in studio conditions recording Dark side of the moon and how they aquired the special effects for the album. Also giving you a brief look into their off time between sessions. This video is definitly for the tripper if you know what I mean.
5,Brutal!,"If you like Floyd...this is THE video to own. The Wall is an awesome experience...Pulse is a great way to get a feel for the band(sans Roger Waters)at a concert later in their career....But this is PINK FLOYD in their early days. The music is awesome, the visuals are amazing. I bought this tape not knowing what to expect, but WOW! This is a monster of a tape...you drift from interviews with the band, to the guys just hanging out, to live performances amongst the ruins of Pompeii. My only regret is that this is not available on DVD."
5,Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii review,"If you're a pre 1972 Floyd fan, this is the best that they have produced, from the trace like Echos to the eary Set the controls for the heart of the Sun.The setting is in Ancient Rome's Pompeii ampitheater which complements the music perfectly. They could have only bettered this if they had played in front of Khufu's Pyramid on the Rosja (Giza) plateau.80 minutes of pure genius - floyd at their best!"
5,Great Tape,I love this film and the quality of the VHS is superb. I collect rare VHS tapes and this was definitely a good buy.
5,Get some buddha!!!!!,"This video is the best thing I have ever watched while having a good time if you know what I mean!!!!!! So if you have not tried it, do it and watch this video."
5,"Great,could not move.",Whatever i say will be nothing.An experience you have to live so that you will be able to understand the genuis of PINK FLOYD.Really a breathtaking video.
5,Not much more to say...,"There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said...At the time of my writing, there are 81 reviews. I just wanted to contribute to the stats.This is an amazing film; not just a rock or music video. It is an amazing piece of art and cinematography. I would have to say it represents all the aspects of rock and roll that The Wall didn't cover; the truly artistic aspects. What could be better than your own show in the arena at Pompeii with no one except the band and a film crew??????"
3,A view into the past,"When watching this, we get to see Pink Floyd just before their success of Dark Side of the Moon. This isn't necessarily like a concert video though because there isn't any crowd. Rather, this was created with the purpose of putting some images to the music. We get to see the band perform, so that's good. There are a few times when the filming would focus on quick cuts, superimposition of images, and dissolves let the music act as the background to the image. Since I've never seen the band in concert (and most likely never will) I would have liked to see the acutal Men more than their electrical equipment during Echoes."
4,Essential For Early Floyd Fans,"Attention fans of early Pink Floyd music: this video is for you! Carrying about nine or ten songs, this video features Pink Floyd live at Pompeii, a place of ancient mystery and imagination. The setting and some of the footage in this video truly adds to the unique characteristics of Pink Floyd's music. This video features songs such as ""Echoes"" and ""A Saucerful of Secrets"". All these songs sound great in this unique live video. This is truly a must for Floyd fans everywhere."
3,Learn to play drums watching this video,"This is a decent video if you are a drummer. Lots and lots of drums throughout. Not much in the way of seeing Gilmore play guitar. You will see his face a lot but not much finger work. I was especially burned with ""One of these days"". The version here is great, but you won't see anything but the drummer. If you are a musician and like to see your heros play this isn't the video to watch unless of course you play drums. The sound quality is very good. I WON'T be buying this one on DVD if it ever comes out."
1,Buy New Tape - Not Used,"This is a review of the tape quality. The film itself is great! I have the DVD. I bought the VHS tape for my VHS hook-up to my stereo system. Unfortunately, I bought the cheap used tape, and the quality of the tape and recording is bad, especially the audio part - the most important! My suggestion is to spend the extra bucks for the brand new, never used tape. I learned the hard way never to buy a cheap used tape. You might luck out and get a good one, but don't count on it."
1,Might be enjoyable if you're high,"I love Pink Floyd's music, and love the ""Delicate Sound of Thunder"" video. So I bought this one. YUCK! It's one of those depressing 1970's art films that somehow manage to accrue a cult following. There's too much pre-concert ""behind the scenes"" footage, the picture quality is poor, the cinematography is horrible, and - well, I have only watched it once. It almost ruined my love for the band. It portrays them as real lowlife scuzzballs."
5,The real thing,"My ears have listenened to a lot of things including saturday afternoon IRIE-FM, the thing the average Jamaican is given. This album represents the class and style that someone (god bless their soul) has the sense to preserve and disseminate to the masses. Listen to Earnest Ranglin. JAH People live. Ken"
5,Performs Well For Budget Memory,Bought this to expand a big-box store's Acer Desktop memory. Installed with no problem at all. Performs as expected and s a good deal for budget memory.
4,No Problems,"This memory was added to my desktop to augment the 2GB that came with the computer. I followed the instructions provided by the pc manufacturer and the installation went without a hitch. Although I have seen an improvement in performance it wasn't as dramatic as I was hoping for...still, it was an expensive upgrade that will extend the useful life of the pc."
4,Nice,I got it popped it in and it worked. No hassle. Just before you buy make sure you get the right type of ram for your computer
5,Durable Memory!,Had it for months and Crucial memory products are durable unlike the ones I bought before for the same computer that never last longer than 8 months but this one's a keeper!
5,Excellent upgrade,This is great ram for a great price. Simple to install and it worked great. I would highly recommend this.
2,One stick died,"After installing in my brand new mac mini, one of the sticks dies so now I only have 8GB RAM installed. Cool. I know its a risk when you buy memory but this was the most expensive option and it still died."
5,very great,Ordered my product within the beginning of the month received it earlier than expectec! Product works very well like brand new. Couldnt expect nothing better!
5,Quick and Reasonable,"The product arrived quickly, within a few days of ordering. The price was very reasonable compared with other companies and OEM."
4,confirmed working in Dell Dimension e521,"this RAM installed easy, and worked fine.the delivery was prompt, and greatly improved the performance of my computer. I would recommend this product to friends."
5,Recognized the memory right away!,I bought this memory with no experience of installing my own memory upgrade. It was an easy install and the memory was recognized right away with no problem at all. My computer is so much faster now than it was before! I have an Acer Aspire by the way.
4,Worth the money,"My computer was moving at a snail's pace, it only had 500 MB of memory. Added the 2 GB of memory and now runs like a champ. It was a good price, cheaper than buying it from the manufacturer when I ordered the computer."
5,Beautiful Designs,"I happened to find this gem at a second hand store, and immediately fell in love with several of the designs. Deborah Kneen talks about the regional folk art of different parts of France and has designed some beautiful pieces for decorative painters to try. The design I painted of the menu board with the cherubs nearly caused fistfights at the auction I donated it too. It went for $300.00! I also painted the pepper mill with the Montpellier roses in traditional blue and yellow. Gorgeous! Beautiful book, as interesting to read as it is to paint with. I disagree with the previous reviewer who thinks these designs are more suited to children. If you love folk art, and are a decorative painter, give this a try. You won't be sorry.Thank you Deborah!"
2,Folk Art of France,"This is a ""how-to"" craft book, rather than a history and description of French folk art. It mainly deals with how to paint stencil designs on pottery, metal and wood. The objects that may be crafted with the instructions in this book tend to be things that children, rather than adult folk art collectors, would appreciate."
2,What's the rave about?,"I was looking forward to this cd huge cause of all the rave and comericails i heard for it. It came down to a big disapointment when i played it. TOO MANY LYRICS, NOT ENOUGH FLOW! That's what it all comes down to. If you bought all the other cd's that you want then go ahead if not i know there is better stuff out there...."
3,"Too much talk, too disco","I was looking forward to this based on the reviews, but be warned that most tracks are lyric-heavy and very disco. Eartha Kitt's ""Where Is My Man"" is pretty cool. ""Sandstorm"" is great, though you're probably sick of it if you listen to grooveradio.com. Should have gone with my gut instinct and not bought an album named ""Party Time""."
5,BUY THIS CD!!,this cd is really tight and has been practically the only cd i've been listening to since i got it. its got songs that club hoppers and ravers will like.. many of the songs are lyrical and will appeal to those that like more club stuff. disk 2 is my favorite and has stuff that me and my girls like to groove to.
4,"Good, but...","This book can be fun for the whole family. Not only does it challenge you to think about how many of these ""basic life skills"" you and your family and friends have, but it provides concise, well-written answers to questions like ""How do I change the oil in my car?"" I do warn you, though, that if, like me, you were expecting to get the answers to questions such as ""Did Puck and Rachel really sleep together?"" or ""Did Ruthie ever get that drinking problem under control?"", this is not the book for you."
3,Valuable information in a fragile package,"This is a great collection of information about maps and charts for almost every purpose, on land or sea or in the air. Many, many kinds of maps are represented here, together with information about places to get them.The book has a so-called ""perfect binding"" (signatures are glued together, not sewn). And, since the pages are very heavy because they are coated with clay in order to be glossy, sections of the book tend to pull loose from the spine. A long-lived reference work such as this one ought to be sewn together, not glued."
3,"Genuine is great. Working my way back, not good","Would never have bought the working my way back part of the cd, except it is bundled together with ""Genuine"".Genuine Imitation Life Gazette is still worth it. One of the best ""parodies"" around, with some interesting music."
5,Buena Vista Reggae Club,This music has the kind of groove that just rises right up out of the Earth.
5,Bruckner 7 Solti Chicago Royal Albert Hall 1978,"This video recording made in 1978 at Royal Albert Hall during the orchestra's European tour lets you SEE and HEAR the fabulous and famous sound of Sir Georg and his heavenly band. Perfectly in tune brass, complete with Wagner Tuba quartet and the incomparable Bud Herseth and Dale Clevenger, sublime strings, ethereal woodwinds. It doesn't get any better than this. We may never hear something so spectacular again. Available only VHS"
2,Cheap looking,Eves Addiction is a very good retailer. I would buy from them again...just not this ring. I bought this for my wife but when she got it she was very dissapointed. The quality of this ring is pretty poor. We returned it.
4,I use these in my office and garage,"These shelves are really great. I use them in both my office and in the garage. They are very sturdy, light weight, easily assembled and I am very glad that I made this choice. The only reason that I gave them a rating of a 4 star, is that for use in the garage, which I use on for storing my oil and paint spray cans, I had to make a floor for each shelf to stop the cans from falling on their sides.In the garage I also use one for the storage of my motorcycle helmets and other cold weather riding equipment. This was a super good use for the cabinet. Unlike other plastic type of shelves, this is very rugged and sturdy. The shelves don't bend even after five years of use. My other plastic shelves were junk. The material and design on these are very well made so I highly recommend them. C. Jeff Dyrek"
5,Deductive theory of scaling,"A cutting edge research on the fabric of space and time with promising applications, rendered in an intelligible form.The singularity in the universe beginning is self-consistently avoided in a way that sets the foundations of a deductive theory of scaling, which allows elegant solutions of physical and mathematical problems.The principle of uncertainty and Einstein's energy and mass equivalence are derived in the terms of Eugene Savov's theory of interaction.This seminal book is a highly descriptive and colorful read. A great buy for scientists and laymen."
4,Acey De Uno In Full Effect,"One of Hip Hop's most under-appreciated emcees makes his presence felt with a great debut album. With a reputation as a gifted wordsmith, Ace plays with the English language without sacrificing subject continuity. Usually, an artist who displays verbal gymnastics will tend to go off topic and not stick with the script in the song. This is not the case with Aceyalone. He puts together some engaging narratives and has a broad vocabulary. I don't think he has been battle tested which doesn't surprise me because with tracks like ""Arhythamaticulas"", who really wants to test him in a game of wits. The album was released in the mid 1990's when the west coast g-funk scene was popping. If you weren't into whiny synthesizers and overly explicative lyrics (not that I see anything wrong with that) then Ace and the rest of the Freestyle Fellowship was the perfect alternative. If this album bounces in your court then fear not because the music is far from falling flat."
4,All Balls Dont Bounce,As one of the members of the Freestyle Fellowship crew Aceyalone stands out with a style like no others in the hip hop scene. His best work is clearly laid out on each track of All Balls Dont Bounce. The way in which Aceyalone switches up his rhyme style keeps the album moving and interesting always leaving the listeners a sense of anticipation for the next song.
2,Q: What do feminists want? A: Whatever they want.,"While surveying the landscape of contemporary feminism, this confused book does little more than reiterate Barbie's ""girls can do anything message"". The book tries to be a mixture of opinion based on survey data and some findings from science, while at the same time critiquing such writers as Faludi and Wolf. Some of it's good, some is horrendous."
3,Kind of large,"As with all Wilton items, this is made of inexpensive clunky plastic, which is very hard to clean. The emblems are each about the size of a quarter, not a nickel as it seems in the picture."
2,not very good,"I'm in the cake decoration business, and I've tried to use it a couple of time, and the past gum get stuck, the form it is suppose to show is not there."
2,Too many omissions...,"What a letdown. Looking through this book you'll notice that all the films that are mention only go back to Batman and Akira up to all these Marvel licenses being used for the big screen (Makes you wonder the intentions of this book.). The only film made prior to those films mentioned in the book is Superman. The editor of this book must of not been doing enough research because there's a smorgasbord of comic book adaptations missing such as Popeye, Flash Gordon, Blondie, Fritz The Cat, Barbarella (!!!), Footrot Flats... Besides that the essays written for each movie is very detailed and contains a lot of general information concerning the production and critical aspect of each film. But, you never quite feel satisfied over the incompleteness of the list."
2,The Overveiw of the Conflict,"I rate this book 3 stars because it portrays the true conflict of the Korean War, but it doesn't really give a lot of detail. When I read a book it should ""paint"" a vivid image but all I see is a blank canvas."
4,Rationalization,"I bought this book for a course in Communications. The research gives different points of views to Ritzer's book. At times it is too technical, but often interesting to any layperson."
4,true to life,"Of course the characters don't look or have the same lives asordinary people, but they behaved like real people would and it seemed to me the movie ended the only way it could.Anthony Perkins is sympathetic as an empty, lost soul trying to be charming and charismatic. Montand's character never pretends to be anything but what he is. Bergman is a consumnate craftswoman. I think alot of women should be so lucky as to have her character's problem, even if she ends up the movie's big loser.It's hard to know whether Bergman's character is really entirelyin love with Montand's character or just to much of a sap to ignore what the people around her are saying. The scene on the staircase would seem to reinforce the latter possibility.The movie illustrates well the outcome of people who can't feel whole or content without other people."
5,One of the best books on the subject of Russian painters!,"I was lucky to purchase this book about 12 years ago when it was still in publication. It has great reproductions with vivid colors. Repin's paintings look fantastic, among others. It is a quality book with a wide range of styles from various artists of the period. This book truly opened my eye with regards to Russian paintings as if looking through a gate to a rarely seen artistic El Dorado. That said, I can not believe how much some vendors are charging for the book unless it is in such high demand among collectors. If you can afford it, grab a copy."
2,A guide on what to paint,"""A Passion for Watercolor: Painting the Inner Experience"" is written by a psychologist who is a watercolor artist. The focus of this book is to encourage the reader to broaden their horizons on the topic of what to paint. Guidance on technique is very thin -- almost nonexistent -- and this is fine, as there are many other books out there on this topic. Rather, the author focuses on the process of creative interpretation: discover what you like to paint, what that means to you, how to express your feelings visually, and so forth. There is a lot in this book on using introspection to develop topics for art. Each chapter begins (about 1/2 content) with the author's thoughts on the topic -- say, what fruit means to her, and how she brings that out in art -- and then suggests approaches & loosely worded projects you might use.If you enjoy self examination, you will probably adore this watercolor book's fresh aproach. For myself, I just didn't get it."
1,"Introspection, not watercolor","The title of this book has put it in the art books category, but it is much more an autobiographical account of using painting for introspection. I bought it because I thought, with the author's qualifications, it would be inspirational both personally and artistically. I was very disappointed - the artwork is far from inspirational and the text seems mostly the author's own artistic journey."
1,Excellent,"I think that Techno is a good music. I like the product. When I listen to the sounds and put them all together, they sound neat. You should buy it. Games I recommend: Worms 6, Delux Baseball 2, Hockey 4.0 for Mack, and the first demo disk on Playstation ever. Buy them."
3,"Mostly Ayn Rand talking over a slideshow of stills, relatively bland","I found my attention wandering often. The film focuses on her life story, told by her voice, usually over simple pictures and with only occasional video in the first half of the film. About 10-15 minutes near the end of the film focus more specifically on her philosophy, including a greater density of interviews, which are consistently more engaging than the earlier component of the film. Overall this film was fine, but certainly not spectacular.As a substitute, I'd recommendAyn Rand - A Sense of Life. That film covers much of the same material but is better composed. However, some may say ""In Her Own Words"" is preferred since it is basically all literally in Ayn's own words and voice."
4,Good to see for those unfamiliar with Ayn Rand,"Usually, when discussing Ayn Rand, I have seen two types of people: those who love and those who hate her. Often, those who are negative haven't actually read her works; their understanding is second-hand, predigested opinions of others. Most of the time, criticism of her is personal (character assassination) and rarely are her actual ideas discussed. This video is a quick way to get an introduction to the real Ayn Rand.The DVD uses clips from the few existing video recordings and isn't structured by philosophical topics or ideas. Therefore, don't expect this DVD to be comprehensive.Hopefully, it will encourage those with pre-conceived, incorrect assumptions to further investigate the ideas of Ayn Rand."
3,Ayn Rand in her own words,"The aplty titled ""Ayn Rand: In her Own Words"" lets Ayn Rand tell her own life's story and explain some of her ideas and how she wrote her novels. All of her narrative is taken from various TV interviews she gave during her life, incluing Mike Wallace and Phil Donahue. Besides Rand, there's no narrator here. The narration is accompanied by still photographs and film clips.Rand fans won't find much new here, but may enjoy it anyway. For those unfamiliar with Rand, it might be a good introduction to learn who she was and what some of her ideas were."
4,More relevant than ever,"I was so pleased this movie was made and available. Long overdue and the result is excellent , I am looking forward to the next one. Hope it is available soon."
2,disappointed,"Ayn Rand lived an amazing life. This film fails to explain how incredible she was, and why she influenced so many people"
2,Ayn Rand Was WRONG!!!!,"This last Great Recession has proven Ayn Rand was totally wrong with her philosophy of government and finance. Her ideas that the financial world should be totally independent from the government, which Alan Greenspan worshiped her btw, was completely WRONG!!! She's a spacecat who lives in another world!! I gave this thing a chance but it is horrible."
1,She sure does love herself!,"Not much about Rand's life to know really. She was rich and thought that she was a genius. She never developed past 13 and was probably a satanist. And somehow, the religious right, and the fiscal conservatives come together to throw Jesus from the train in order to masticate Rand's magical journey through the wretched loathsomeness of wealthiness and atheism. I'm sure there's a Southern Baptist preacher with all her books next to every version of the bible in their study and no clue to the massive hypocrisy of having two masters. All in all, this was overrated."
3,Be Careful!,"Absent of the Scriptures this book has had the most influence on my Life. The Christian Life is to be lived by the Spirit. Chafer provides a good review of the Scriptures regarding the Spiritual Life.The down side is Chafer taught what he called ""True Mysticism"" (not discussed in this book). This resulted from the rejection of Christ's commandments as not applying to the Church. This is likely Chafer's greatest error. There is no mysticism involved in the Christian Life. Yes we are to walk by the Spirit. And the Spirit being God cannot cause us to violate Christ's Commandments.God Bless!"
3,Book Outlines No-Lordship Position,"Dr. Chafer was a well respected man of God. As a teacher, pastor, and theologian, Chafer brought to the Body of Christ a desire to teach God's truth by God's Spirit.This book is not one of my favorite Chafer books. While I have no problem reading books that I disagree with, I did find that this book was quite boring and shallow in its teaching on the holiness of the believer.Chafer outlines in this book his defense of ""no-Lordship"" salvation. That is that one can become a Christian but never move beyond mere mental belief in the facts of the gospel. He proposes that those who are spiritual (that is sold out to Jesus) mustn't judge those who appear to not be. God alone is the judge (Matthew 7:1) so let the Holy Spirit lead them to a deeper relationship with Himself (John 6:44).For a balanced and biblical view of ""Lordship"" salvation please see John MacArthur's book ""The Gospel According To Jesus"" and ""Faith Works."""
4,MUST READ,not easy material to read but you should if you want to understand the socalled mother-sons.
3,80% Great,"Eighty percent of this CD is very, very good. But I found one number on it to be particularly annoying, and another to be just fair. I'm going to copy it and re-burn it with those two tracks missing.Overall, this is a great CD and I am glad I bought it."
3,Not as Good as the Original,"This book is moderately helpful, but not as good as Hogg and Blau's original ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer."" While that book was an invaluable asset and demonstrated Hogg's true expertise with babies, this one seems to emulate its predecessor instead of standing on its own. I found the first one much more helpful and practical than ""What to Expect the First Year,"" but now I find ""What to Expect the Toddler Years"" to be more informative than this toddler book. If you're as big a fan of the first book as I was, you probably are tempted to go right out and buy this one as soon as your baby becomes a toddler. I would encourage you to read it to benefit from some of the more helpful parts (especially good, in my opinion, were the ritual and routine recommendations), but unfortunately, it doesn't pass the test to be your go-to guide to your toddler."
4,Keep Whispering As Your Baby Grows Up.....,"Hogg and Blau use a very workable, applicable style to deal with parenting a toddler: as I am on my fourth toddler, I can attest that the techniques are valuable and easily used in parenting.I especially appreciate the step by step approach and belief in ""conscious"" parenting instead of parenting-by-the-numbers. The suggestions and notes from ""real"" people via email interspersed further give the book a personalized, realistic flavor.The ending chapters about having another baby and valuing relationships are very much a part of parenting the toddler. My only wish is there was a touch more in regards to collaborative-parenting with both parents being consistent Baby Whisperers."
2,Good advice for Passive kids,"I liked the Baby Whisperer book, even though I did not agree with her on everything. This book seemed like a book put out in a hurry without the detailed know how of her first book.I am certain her techniques work well with passive toddlers. If you have a demanding toddler and juggling a demanding life, you will likely find this book frustrating. Much of her advice when tried on a demanding child will get you no where. She does have some good tips, but overall I did not get as much substance as I did fromt he first book."
3,"Good, but not great","This audio book is good, but not as great as I was expecting. It is certainly not worth paying cover price for. The accent in her voice is a little hard to listen it; it is very quiet mono-tone. She has some very good advice, but a lot of it just seems more lime common sense rather than a how-to type thing. I guess I was expecting more how-to type advice like on the tv series, supernanny or nanny 911. For example, your toddler behaves this way because of this and these are your options of how to deal with it to best fit the needs if your toddler. That sort of thing."
2,Contradictory and insulting,"I got this book after multiple people said it was invaluable. I found the tone to be sarcastic and judgmental. I was also confused by some of the contradictory advice: she says she's appalled by how many people let their toddlers dominate the home and call the shots. Then, when apparently asked how to deal with a kid who throws food, she replies, ""He's not hungry, Luv. Let him play for a half hour and then try again."" What are you doing tonight? Clearly, I'm supposed to be catering dinner every 30 minutes until my 2-yr old feels like eating."
2,Common Sence,"I thought this book was a lot of basic information about toddlers that most parents already know. It gave no strategies to try or routines to set up to make life easier. It basically says that to be able to manage your toddler's behavior you need to know what kind of a toddler they are. Ok? So I know my child is a ""textbook"" toddler, now what? I feel like the book doesn't go any further than that! It was a waste of money."
2,Condescending,"If you're into schedules, this book is for you. I found it useless. Her attitudes towards toddler nursing is deplorable. What are her credentials? A ""baby whisperer""? I guess I just don't get it. I didn't read the first book and I'm glad. I read a more attachment parenting friendly book and found its contents much more my style."
1,Love your babies...,"Tracy Hogg sound like a selfish person who only wants to get rid of her kids so she can write more books and make more money. You should pick up, hug, cuddle, and love those little ones and don't ignore them because if you do you will get spoild brats."
2,Glad it worked for ya,"I am an avid reader of baby/toddler rearing books and this one is the worst so far. This seemed to be the gist, ""This is what I did with my children and I am right, so you should do it this way too."" Okay, this is not to say that there weren't a few tidbits of good information. You just have to weed/read through a lot of junk to get to it. Not enough fact/scientific facts to back up opinions and suggestions. Sorry, but overall, THUMBS DOWN."
2,Love the music but not a great,"I love this musical.I saw it live and it was absolutely wonderful,however ,I am seriously dissappointed after listening to this version.Originally I bought the LA cast version with Micheal Damion and returned it because I was not happy with the vocal performances and got this one instead.Donny Osmond is definetly better than Damion,but the rest of the singers really leave something to be desired.The Pharaoh is horrible at his Elvis impression especially compared to the LA cast version,Benjamin Calypso is also terrible, I am not really impressed with the narrator either.I cannot believe they did so bad with the rest of the cast.I am seriously disappointed with all the versions I have heard.They definetely could have done much better.I just saw Monica Patton and Jon Secada in the national tour and they did much better especially Monica Patton."
2,joseph techicolr dream coat,most of the tracks either skipped or didnt play i was very disappointed because i have been looking for this cd for a while its one of my favorites
4,"If you saw the play with this cast, you'll love this CD","While Janet Metz isn't the greatest narrator for ""Joseph"", Donny Osmond is the perfect ""Joseph."" Those who saw this production will thoroughly enjoy re-living it as they listen to the songs on this CD.From the infectious ""Any Dream Will Do"" to the moving ""Close Every Door"", and the humor behind the reggae ""Benjamin Calypso"" and Elvis-like Pharoah's ""Song of the King"" you'll find yourself singing right along.This is fun CD to own. Do yourself a favor and order one."
2,Janet Metz - two thumbs down,"I'm only 14, but I've been around the block of broadway a few times, and I have to say I threw away this CD (well, not <i>literally</i>) after hearing just five seconds of Janet Metz's awful high, squeaky voice. I am also a lead vocalist, and I must say that Metz's babyish, gravelly tone is unattractive and extremely difficult to listen to.My favorite narrator is Maria Freidman, who did the film version of ""Joseph."" Her voice is richer, deeper - definitely better overall."
2,BEFORE it was a musical...,"BEFORE it was a musical it was a cantata with orchestra and children's choir. Slicked, glossed, and cheesy, the broadway versions all fall short of the original, concise masterpiece recorded on the ONE AND ONLY ORIGINAL version alas, out of print and available only on vinyl. As overblown broadway versions go, this 1992 version may be the best. But, for those of us who grew up listening to the original, the broadway versions do nothing but disappoint. The Joseph Consortium version of the original cantata recording included Tim Rice singing the role of Pharoah and was released by Scepter Records. Where the rights may be now for re-release, who knows?"
1,Why oh why......,I also have been searching for the ORIGINAL Joseph for years. Scepter Records number SPS 588X. I have the vinyl album right in front of me - and no way to play it or record it to disc. It is too scratched and old. Doesn't anyone out there have a decent recording of this? Why is it not on CD? I have also heard all the other versions out there...and none can compare to the original recording by the Joseph Consortium.
4,Great.... but some weak points,"overall, this is a good album. ""close every door"" is the best version i've ever heard. there are some weak links though, namely ""those canaan days."" i recently sang this for my cyc's production and, quite frankly, my version was better. and normally i'm not egocentric.... but it's the truth in this case."
1,Bait and Switch,"The advertising was listed the cast of the movie version, while it actually contains only Donny Osmond from the movie everyone else is not from the movie version with Maria Friedman as it states on the website. Sent it back, since this copy was improperly advertised."
4,Almost as good as the show...,"I love this musical and all of the songs in it. This disk lets you sing along with the cast in your car. The drawback is that the female voice fades and is barely audible at times. The King rules...Go, Go, Go Joseph!"
2,Unhappy with sound,"I had bought an original cassette when I saw the show in Chicago. I was very excited to find this CD as I had worn the cassette out. I was however very disappointed with the quality of sound. I could not hear the lead singer over the chorus, no matter how I adjusted my speakers. I do not know if all these CD's are like this, but I would not recommend it due to poor quality of sound."
2,Not recommended,"I wouldn't recommend this production. While the orchestra and some of the signers are great (Christie's direction is usually spot on), the choreography is irritating and stupid, and most of the other visual gimmicks (for example, the video projections of animals and speeding trains) are pointless and distracting. In fact, I became so irritated by the constant visual clutter on stage and the silly acrobatic dancing that I ended up turning off the TV and just listening to the sound track."
1,Wait...isn't this a BAROQUE opera?,"Luckily for this production, Rameau is long dead and therefore unable to sue them for visually destroying such fine music. Buy the CD and save your retinas the damage!"
2,No Good,"I Like ""Rameau - Les Indes Galantes "" better. 18th century opera performed in 20th century custom.....that is not my cup of tea. Music is Good otherwise there will be no star."
3,Zaniest thing!,Saw some of this on television and had to have a copy!Break dancing - some of the best - to madrigal like opera - all stops out staging - crazy!
2,Don't waste your money!,"Do not waste your money on this book. There is plenty of information with useful, downloadable information from the following two sites: Oprah.com...Oprah's debt diet contains vital information provided by three widely known and esteemed financial experts, on how to reduce your debt. You should also (if you haven't already) go to Truecredit.com and purchase all three credit scores. This site also has excellent tools for you to download such as financial spreadsheats/worksheets, and all of the information about how your credit effects you, as well as ways to improve your score. Between truecredit.com, and quicken, and the experts on Oprah's debt diet, I found the superb ways to organize and reduce my debt!"
1,No details,"This book has some good examples, but lacks any detail.It skims over all the complicated topics.Does not do a very good job at demonstrating how to build applications that integrate a web browser and an ip phone.Very introductory."
2,Great potatos - needs more meat,"While I found this book very informative (and it helped clear up many questions I had), I think the authors should be a little clearer on certain issues and not assume that everyone reading the book is a web/HTTP expert. More in-depth coverage of authentication, posting, etc will go a long way to making the book a great reference for anyone wanting to develop XML applications for Cisco IP Phones."
2,not an especially good season,"This might have been the least interesting seasons of TUF. Kos' trash talking skills are pretty weak. He uses the ""bro you're a nurse"", line about 20 times without being able to come up with any remotely original follow-up insults. Yes, he's good at getting people to hate him, but why is that considered a skill these days?GSP is likeable but other than his ""bully"" story on the bonus footage, he doesn't have a lot of interesting things to say either.Most of the house antics we've seen before in previous seasons (smashing stuff, lame ""pranks""). Most of the conflicts amongst the fighters were the drunken ""I'd squash you"" stuff which became stale many seasons ago.In my opinion the highlights of the show were GSP's Thai boxing coach showing up drunk before sparring sessions and Cody's deadly skills with the guillotine."
5,These hoses were a perfect replacement for the original wore out hoses. They installed with no problems. Thank you for a great p,These hoses were a perfect replacement for the original wore out hoses. They installed with no problems. Thank you for a great product
1,Clueless after 13 years in the senate. Still clueless in '04,"The excuses various reviewers give for the embarassing lacunae in this supposedly well informed author's perspective on terrorism are as amusing as the book itself.While Kerry (or his ghost-writer) cut and pasted a rambling collection of ""terror as product of criminal enterprises"" factoids, Yossef Bodansky was gathering available information for his 1999 best seller, ""Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America.""The event to which the title refers was a public manifesto by Osama, released in 1996. The fact that Kerry's 1997 book manages to avoid even a reference to Bin Laden, after his years on a Senate committee specializing in the subject of terrorism suggests a ""guardian of American security"" asleep at his post.""Reporting for duty!"" indeed. Hmmm, let's see your signed Form 180, OK? Soon."
1,Propaganda,"This book is a disgrace to all politicians, especially since the author used this book to describe the current war on terror. I read this book from front to back three times and nothing came up about terrorism. This book is a good book to read if you like a perspective on the history of terrorism, but if you want to read something that has to do with current issues (last 15 years) on terrorism then choose something else, because you will just be reading fiction, which the author was trying to get the reader to believe."
3,Know the true John Kerry,"This book is an excellent example of how out of touch Mr. Kerry is on the serious issues facing America today. Mr. Kerry has been against this country protecting itself for years, and this book shows how seriously misdirected he and his supporters are in the war on terror."
1,Japanese yakuza ?,"When I saw the Bush tv-ad claming that John Kerrys ""Great plan on Terror"" was on the Japanese yakuza ! I was sceptic, so I read the book. The tv-ad was right !!! I recomend you to read this book. It will affect you."
4,Proper Tech-Breaks,"A good compilation by an amazing DJ. If you ever get the chance to see Meat Katie live, I suggest you do it. He is a flawless dj with a serious sound. This collection of hard, tech breaks is enough to please any type of electronic music fan. With tracks by producers like Elite Force, Soul of Man, and of course Meat Katie himself, you know before you listen to it, that it's gonna be good. My only complaint is that I could definitely do without the ""diva"" vocal moments. I feel like this would be a perfect mix cd, if it didn't have that stupid ""they just don't undertand house music"" vocal sample. But that is nowhere near enough to ruin the CD by any means. It's still probably the best mix CD to come out for a a year or longer. I'm glad someone took notice of Meat Katie and gave him a proper 2CD mix on Bedrock. Nice. I hope this is the first of may mixes to come on the Bedrock label."
1,OK. Not really accurate,"First off. This comes as a DVD-R not a pressed DVD, so incompatibility might occur on some DVD Players.That being said, this is DVD rip of a VHS master. It's ok, it's basically the fundamental of Wing Chun. Not very good in the details. No chapter stops. I believe it's only 30 minutes long.I would say that the cost and quality exceeds the value of this DVD."
1,Wing Chun Kung Fu,"The DVD cover looked good online but it is nothing more than a inkjet printed cover. Poor audio. No structure on topics covered. Nothing more than a home video with the Master and his students demonstrating some aspects of wing chun. Could be better but for now really poor show. For the price I paid for it, simply not worth the money."
4,nice mix of surefire hits,"overall, dave ralph's ""love parade"" is a nice mix of some of today's best trance songs. he's got some surefire hits on this record, such as the sasha+digweed approved ""muzak"" by trisco, and a remix of moby's hit ""porcelain."" he also includes ""airtight"" by max graham and ""music"" by jamez presents tatoine, both staples in oakenfold's record box. there are a few tracks that serve as filler, but it's worth it to sit through them to get to the gems. dave's mixing is good, but not as smooth as his live sets, or on his ""tranceport 2."" i wouldn't recommend this album if you're looking for something adventurous from dave ralph. pick up ""tranceport 2"" if you don't have it already, though. it's truer to his live sets. (to clarify, this album was not recorded live at the love parade, just the enhanced portion of the cd)"
3,I'll concur with the masses on this one.,"I have to agree that this isn't Dave Ralph's most amazing set of tracks, but his work is so consistantly excellent that it still outshines most of his peers (and certainly all the punters in the space). I'd recommend this to people who have either a large trance collection already or who are diehard Dave Ralph fans.I fall into both categories, so there's certainly no regrets in my purchase. For the record, if you're looking for really strong work by the same artist, pick up Tranceport 2. A little dated, but still very strong indeed."
3,Going through The Motions,"Unlike his ""Tranceport"" CD, this is not a groundbreaker, it's just another show. The enhenced CD contains a visual piece which attempts to capture the ""excitement"" of the great European Dance party, but instead looks like a hurried rush through a crowded city, with nothing particularly interesting or exciting happening at all (the ""DJ Performance"" is just a short part at the end, and looks like more of an afterthought than the main purpose of the whole video piece).Unfortunatly, except for ""FLASH"" (Tito Maas remix), and Moby's ""PORCELAIN"" (also a remix), this CD seems to be more of an afterthought than a main attraction.While the DJ scene is said to be ""huge"", it won't remain so if the product all starts to sound the same, and becomes bland. Formula mixes such as this may be just what teh promoters wanted, but it makes for rather tepid listening fare, once..."
3,caked in lines,"I have oily/combination skin and have been using Clinique for 15yrs. I'm starting to get fine lines under my eyes, so I tried this thinking it would be better than the regular thicker concealer. I was hoping this would be a gentler cover for the more delicate area under my eyes. Unfortunately, the opposite came true. This concealer sank into my fine lines and made them look caked in. It highlights rather than conceal my lines which is really disappointing. This actually looks bad on wrinkles, no matter how fine. I'm now using it as a regular concealer on my cheeks."
3,Concealer,A life saver when I was overseas. I still don't remember what happened to my other one. I was thankful for amazon.com for selling my color!
5,Great book,Very interesting book.Profesional translation.I am interested in history of christian religon and I am sure it is a milestone in understandig it.worth buying.
3,a book for anyone interested in cuba and espionage,i liked the fact that the author does not waste time. the book is a short and easy read. a good introduction to espionage in the third world. not much information on cuba or on why the author broke from communism. he and his wife just seemed to dislike the austerity of it all was all i could garner from the book. he made vague statements about broken promises and unfulfilled expectations. the book however is not primarily about cuba but about espionage. a pleasant enough read if you have the interest in the two subjects.
5,Palestine or the Holy Land From the Earliest Period to the Present...,"This is an older book, no doubt, but this gives it strength if nothing else. I simply forgot how much work and research authors used to do for their books and you will quickly see Michael Russell really digs into the subject. Today we are used to subjects like this getting covered in bullet format. Not here. The author lays out and defines the subject to such a level you cannot help but learn more about Palestine/Holy Land than most any modern writing is going to give you."
3,history,Some parts are better than others but basically there is a lot of detail that becomes tedious. Tends to put me to sleep!
4,Excellent portrayal of early Norse culture.,"Based on various viking sagas, I think that this movie is very well done in so many respects. The acting is good, and the Icelandic scenery and historical accuracy are quite impressive. Some erotic sequences are very well done and appropriate."
3,Not as bad as some of these reviews indicate,"This movie isn't nearly as bad as some of the reviewers here would have you believe. For those reviewers here who are lamenting the lack of good Viking movies, check out The 13th Warrior, it's very good and the best one out there. Beowulf and Grendel, starring Gerard Butler as Beowulf, is also good."
4,surprisingly good,"The Viking Sagas is rough in places, and has some unevenness to sound, but i wasn't expecting a big stuidio production. However, this movie was delightful in it's casting, in it's details of life during the era of Iceland that it depicted, and in the beautiful photography. The story is a combination and simplified tale taken from various sagas. The little touches from the sagas worked throughout the tale had me smiling from ear to ear despite the solemness of the story. Of course there were some modern reworking of ideals, and the movie is very short, but I'm quite glad that i took the chance and bought it."
2,"Visually beautiful, somewhat interesting but poorly scripted","There is a good film to be made about Vikings and their many sagas, but this production is not it. Visually beautiful, somewhat interesting but poorly scripted, the film was better than I had expected given its negative internet reviews. Actually Iceland seems to be stunningly attractive and superb cinematographer turned first time director Michael Chapman does a good job in showing it and keeping the action moving. But the plot is too convoluted, the narration stultifyingly dull. There are moments that almost work like when a Viking's family wait stoicly for death in a burning hut. Thank goodness for the gore and nudity which makes it bearable, but only just. Musclebound Ralf Moeller (TV's Conan) is not that bad, a low rent Schwarzenegger but he doesn't embarrass himself. Well worth a video rental (once) but not a keeper."
2,Viking Movie,Not to bad but could have been much better. Historicaly it was pretty much on the button though.
4,"Gotta hear the complete 19 minute ""Escapism""!!","Yes, this one is most highly recommended for the bonus track alone--- the full, unedited 19 minute take of the classic ""Escape-ism."" But also well-worth having: ""Blues and Pants"" and the title track, which is a different take than the one found on the greatest hits sets."
5,Way too funky for U,"Question,...Who on the face of God's green earth can deliver a 6 track album and move the crowd like nobodys business?The one, the only, Mr. Dynamite, the 'hardest' workin' man in show business,...The Godfather.James, thats who!Mr. Brown cold 'got down'!!!Tupac once rapped,...""I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto""?If it does, then James is conducting the funkiest block party band up there.:-)I personally challenge any artist old or new to drop a 6 cut CD today.Even though 'Escape-ism' is broken up into 3 parts,...its still technically a 6 track project.Nowadays U R lucky to buy a CD with 15 to 22 songs and have 3 to 5 'good' tracks on them.James Browns 'Hot Pants' is funks finest hour. Classic James Brown funky voice-over backed by funky bass lines and guitars riffs.If U R or were a James Brown fan,...this one better be in ya collection!!!Feel me?Nuff said."
5,Love this one,"Okay, so it's only four songs (Escape-ism being inexplicabily divided into two parts even on the CD reissue), and they're more lengthy vamps with semi-improvised vocals shouted over them than anythinng else. But that's the James Brown sound, y'know? And hey, you can't really go wrong with this one: I Can't Stand It doesn't do much for me, but this is one of the funkiest albums EVER outside of that: the nine-minute Hot Pants is a classic, and justly so: it SMOKES. Escape-ism is pretty much JB getting acquainted with his new band, with occasional anti-alcohol lyrics, but to quote the Godfather himself, Ain't That a Groove? But for me, the lazy, funky, ten-minute Blues and Pants steals the show here, great sax part especially. This is an awesome party record."
2,poorly written,"This book is touted as a chilling account of life on the road with a serial killer, I did not find any of this book to be chilling, nor well written. Sandy Fawkes is listed as a writer, technically speaking she is, although she is/was a fashion writer, specifically I didn't think she related her experiences all that well, the only thing she kept ranting about was how boring she thought Knowles was and how much smarter she was then him. I found that she was more pre-disposed to talking about his clothes and lack of sexual prowess. Do not waste your money buying this, there were no insights into the mind of Knowles, and as a ""investigative journalist"" Fawkes failed at securing an interview with Knowles before his death. For anyone thinking this book would have anything of value in profiling or the thought process of of a socio-path look somewhere else."
4,A good overview of Anglo-Latin American relations,"The book is very easy to read and contains many important information, especially focused in four Latin American countries: Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico, which were the more important for British interests in the region."
5,A hit collection,"I never listened to the first album by Adam Freeland, but I'm impressed by this one. The opening title is a jewel (""We want your soul"", with cuts from Bill Hicks), and then the hits keeps on going: ""Mind Killer"", ""Burn the clock"", ""Big Wednesday"" very Aphex Twin, ""Heel 'n' toe"" with its insane break beats, the soulful ""Supernatural thing"", the dub ""L.I.F.E."", and the quiet extro of ""Nowism"". This album takes you from the intro, and doesn't let you down til the end."
2,16 page booklet for 10.95?,"I failed to read the listing, my fault yes, but dont you bid on this thinking you are getting a book, this is 16 pages, of that 9 (or about 4.5 pages of 8 1/2 x 11 content)are actually content, which does list lots of links and some useful links, but 10.95 for 16 page photo copied booklet?"
4,Spoonful of great music,"From the first track to the last, this is a soulful collection of songs that are very enjoyable and a pleasure to listen to!"
4,Very Happy,"A very nice, cost-effective LCD monitor. After using a CRT of the highest quality, this LCD stuns one with its clarity and color saturation. It appears to have relatively low persistance time, as I have played any number of mpeg2 movies (but you *do* see the slightest noise in the picture that was masked with an analog monitor).It is quite true that the 15.1 in LCD equals a 17 inch CRT - I measured them and they were only fractions of an inch different.I have two reservations: Firstly, as text fonts change, especially to small sizes, the text becomes harder to read. Secondly, and maybe this is an illusion, the the image seems to bend inward (concave) to my eye...if I turn the monitor, I can see it is absolutely straight, but too my eye this flatness looks like it has a slight push inward."
2,caveat emptor,"Note carefully the date of publication: 1994Much has changed in the past decade, especially in Caribbean diving."
1,Sent me a glued-together book!,"Knew it was used, but half the pages glued together (by what?) is beyond used. Ruined the pages trying even very carefully to separate them. Almost useless. Not worth 10 cents. It's a good book, just a sloppy seller."
3,not as good as Eclectic,"Now, i agree with most of the other reviews here, but my own view is that for 'early' Bloodlet ( pre- Seraphim / 3 humid nights)you are better off with Eclectic; it has 3 of the songs off Entheogen anyway.Reason -Eclectic sounds rawer, production suits songs better and the tracklist runs better.You still need Entheogen if you are a completist though!"
5,These guys are damn near perfect-- for what they do anyway,"I grew up listening to bloodlet, and I have to admit that I listened to Entheogen for what amounts to probably 200-300 hours of my life. Sometimes while I did other activities, but still, that's a hell of a lot of time. I've played guitar for nearly 7 years, but I don't think I'll ever be up to the level of these guys. In short, I recommend this to anyone who likes music to be little more than just skin-deep. Oh, and if you don't like the idea of listening to some angry music, then just skip this one."
3,Disappointed.,"Although the turtles are adorable, they really don't walk. The toy vibrates, so if it is on a hard surface it sort of just shimmies along a few inches. Also, this one doesn't go in a straight line but bears left, so you can't even follow it anywhere. It doesn't move at all if it is on carpet. It holds my son's attention for about 10 seconds. Overall, it's not as much fun as I'd hoped it would be."
3,"toy is cute, music is AWFUL","Like previous reviews, it does work best on a hard surface floor. It's soft and nice for a newly mobile baby because it doesn't move very fast.The music, however, is horrid. It's very loud and sounds like the tone of a fire alarm. You can't make the turtle move without the music playing. I couldn't stand it so I opened up the electronic compartment and snipped the wires to the speaker. Problem solved."
4,Wish I could remember titles...,"I liked this book and when I was looking through all of the books stored on my kindle, I remembered this author, but not the name of this book. Thank goodness Amazon tells you when you've already purchased a book. Once I read the description, I recalled it perfectly. This was a good story, it's entertaining and it held my interest throughout."
4,love you to pieces!,"Never had a dream frightened Laura so much, nor felt so real. She could still smell the stench of fish, seaweed on a red tide at dawn. Even awake she still sees the signs of danger, especially that coldness in Scott's eyes ... yet there he is, nuzzling the pillow beside her, sweet as a toddler.Everyone loves Laura & when she disappears the fisherman, the boyfriend, the LAPD detective & the boss are drawn into a strange & dark obsession. When the fisherman finds body parts on the beach, everyone is under suspicion.Rebeccasreads recommends GOOD MORNING, DARKNESS for one hellatiously hair-raising tale. Be prepared to have your guesses turned upside-down & your sense of fair play tweaked to the fullest.Could not put it down, I so wanted to find out ""who dunnit!"""
4,Beenie Man : Near his peak,"Beenie Man A.K.A Moses Davis, the self-proclaimed ""girl dem sugar"", is at the top of his game on this disc, relative to the time it was released. Five (5) of the songs on the album made the top ten on the local charts. Writing most of his own lyrics, Beenie is able to bring forth exactly what he as a singer/deejay wants to say.He does this well on his ""bad man"" tunes and equally well, if not better on his ""girl tunes"" namely 'Slam & Tear Off Mi Garments'. Known for his versatility, Beenie sings, 'Me no believe in the devil, or the mark of the beast, I'd rather dead before I put the triple six (666) inna me head.'To iterate, this is a very good album. If you are a true dancehall fan, go and BUY it."
3,Easy o install...but,"Easy to install with Verizon, worked good until I tried playing Call of Duty. I was being kicked out avery few seconds..... I put back my old Verizon DSL/modem/router and I coulsd play Call of Duty again."
1,"ONLY buy this if you have Verizon, ATT or Quest DSL the ones listed WONT WORK WITH OTHERS!","I was so excited until I followed the instructions and it wouldnt auto-detect my providers settings. Then I was on the phone with Tech for about an hour and they know nothing! The router looks sweet and had alot of features but if you dont have the DSL providers that are on the Box that are NAMED, I would not get it because it doesnt work with all DSL providers. I mean we tried everything know to man to get this to work with my PPPoA connection. I think that the Mode is limited on this one and I will not be purchasing Netgear products no more because the Customer Tech help dont know more than the regular guy. I would stay away from this one."
4,"equipment fine, support not so much","The equipment works fine, but trying to get help from their outsourced customer support was enough to make me pull my hair out. The only thing that saved my sanity was that the phone call mysteriously disconnected and I finished up by muddling through the instructions on my own."
4,Follow directions to set up -- and use all their pieces,"I'm typing this review to make sure you DON'T do what I did. I put everything together and tried to install this, and had a miserable time... until I realized that they included an ADSL splitter for a reason. You see, I didn't want to crawl behind the dresser and install the little splitter thingy -- they were both the same, right? Uh-uh. In my wall I had a DSL splitter. In the box was an ADSL splitter.Once I corrected my bonehead error, I was on my way.Oh, and another thing: you must, must MUST get your NETWORK password from your ISP! You'll need it. Don't start installation without it.Now that I have it going, it's dreamy. I got internet for the Mac, the PC and wireless to the iPhone. Excellent.Customer support is darn good."
5,netgear,"we all know netgear, well this dsl gateway works fine out of the box. using w a MAC didnot allow for easy setup software, :)my problem is still AT & T."
2,Nice form factor but not worth it...,"I bought this so that I'd have one unit to be both the modem and wireless router. I miss my old ""best of breed"" solution. For this Texas based AT&T; DSL user, this Netgear router can not maintain an internet connection. At some point the LEDs will just stard flashing wildly.This is a known problem and if you look at Netgear's own user forums before considering purchase, you will note that many have that problem. I have the DG834Gv4. Netgear customer service suggested lowering the MTU to 1400 from 1450 and going with a fixed IP address. That worked for about a day and then back to failing/rebooting several times a day. This is probably the worst piece of electronic equipment that I have owned.Unfortunately I just went by the glowing reviews here and elsewhere.On the plus side, you do save space and improve aesthetics as there is only 1 unit."
3,Works but..................,"Once you get this set up it works great. Initial set up is fine, but some of the security settings don't let you see the Router Wirelessly, which is the reason I bought it. The first one that was shipped tech support told me that the product was defective after they went through their ""trouble shooting"" process. Second one had the exact same issue, rather than calling customer service, I messed with the settings myself and was able to see the router wirelessly on my computer and iphone, and at that point it works great. It gets good speed, can stream videos, haven't tried NetFlix yet, but it streams South Park Studio just fine. Overall a solid product, tech support sucks really bad, and pretty sure that it was outsourced to India, and the folks working there are only following a script. If you are savy enough to figure out the security settings, then this is a good inexpensive wireless router/modem."
3,Set up was a hassle and customer support was completely useless.,"The installation was a pain because the following the given instructions on the CD was for naught. When I called customer support they were completely useless, they just went down the basic troubleshooting list they are trained to do and then tell you that there is nothing they can do unless you try installing on another computer. I gave up trying to deal with them and figured out the problem on my own. So far it has been working fine with only one random disconnect since installation. It runs extremely hot though so I wouldn't place it anywhere cramped."
1,Unreliable,This product was very unreliable and eventually broke after only four months. Netgear's custom service leaves much to be desired.
3,"hot router, literally","This router is good but runs quite hot. The GUI is not as intuitive or impressive as the actiontec dsl router, but the modem is able to maintain good sync for those with low SNR margins. I haven't bothered with the wireless function since I have other wireless routers connected to the network.You may need to reset the router every few days if you run a SIP client or use it for VOIP. Eventually your SIP client will return 408 Request Timeout, and power cycling the router will fix it. A bit annoying, which is why I give it 3 stars."
1,Which version of the Netgear DG834G is this? beware.,"Which version of the DG834G is Amazon selling? there are 4 versions.The latest is the best but earlier versions cannot be upgraded through firmware as the chip sets are different.Beware of buying the earlier ones, why doesn't Amazon say which version this is. If the version is stated I have not seen it."
1,One month out of warranty,"Router was an acceptable product for just over one year. One and one-half months after the warranty expires, so does this router. I took pains to avoid Netgear in the replacement of the product. Maybe you should too."
2,"Problems with firewall, SIP/VOIP, too many hw versions with same name","This router name actually groups 5 models as of 2009 which are completely different. Mine actually doesn't even have a detachable antenna.Many problems with voip/sip devices, firewall doesn't properly turn off or accept rules, and some other minor annoyances..."
1,Broken and returned,Right out of the box and defective from the start!!! Never worked and had to return. As far as I an concerned Netgear sells junk that I will never buy again.
4,Netgear DG834G DSL Router,"Product was as described, but was made 2 years ego, therefore Netgear tech support refused to support me when I had questions. It was already our of warranty period. Otherwise I have no problems and I made it work."
4,Trina,"At first it was difficult to configure the modem to att network but i got a very helpful lady who took me through all the steps and i finally got it configured. Getting help from netgear customer care can be a pain sometimes since some representatives arent very helpful but thank God i got that lady,hope she gets a promotion.Sometimes the wireless signal gets lost if you go too far from the modem but if you unplug the power code for like 10seconds for it to cool down,it works just fine.I've had this modem for like 7months and it has given me very good service.I recommend buying it."
3,rave reviews but didnt meet my expectations,I signed up for Frontier DSL service in my area. I was having connection issues - very low signal margin on my line. I read many reviews that this device could be the miracle cure for such a problem. My expectations were very high and I was sort of disappointed when I got inside to config this thing. The GUI was VERY limited certainly targeted to novices. It didn't change the reliability / stability of my connection. I'm not sure I can blame the modem for that but if you want higher end options and configuration options this is not the router for you. My Cradlepoint mbr1000 blows this thing away.
5,NETGEAR Wireless-G Router/DSL modem,"Great device. Super simple set up, just make sure you call your DSL provider and get the email and password BEFORE trying to set up as it makes the process take about 5 minutes total. Sleek design, awesome performance, I was up and running in about 7 minutes flat. Thats from opening the box to surfing the net."
3,SoCal AT&T DSL users be warned! MUST downgrade firmware,"As many other users pointed out if you are planning to use it on AT&T; DSL in California you will need to download and install an older North American firmware from Netgear website. Otherwise the unit will either not sense DSL in the line or will fail to reconnect.However, after the firmware downgrade, you get an excellent, reliable modem for a very attractive price."
2,Needs firmware upgrade,"Router was constantly dropping connections and I was about to throw it out with the trash but then I upgraded the firmware and tried it again. Never lost a connection after that, worked great. I would recommend, but you will definitely need to upgrade the firmware."
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed the stories and the lives of the boys, their loves and most of all the feeling of the bondmanship."
4,great stories,Love the Quinns. i just hope a duo with the other stories now comes out so I can read all on my kindle without having to buy the others as singles.
3,Inner Harbour,I liked the four brothers as they banded together in good and bad times. The other characters worked quite well too. I didn't like the language in it. I think if it was not in the book it would have been better to read. I was given this book so I'm glad I didn't buy it. It has plenty of romance too.Lyn
1,Totally in the dark!,"I was ripped off buying this DVD! I was expecting live performances of each piece, instead there were boring interpretations of the music playing while staring at a blank, black TV/monitor screen. Yes, the documentary on how the music was performed was OK, but I purchased this DVD to see the performances!"
1,Don't buy This Fake Perfume,This perfume is impossible to find in the US so I tried this option. It smells terrible! It's the worst perfume copy you can imagine. At the beginning I was wandering if it was me that simply didn't like it anymore but I had a little bit left of the one I had purchased in France and it's a completely different scent. I am extremely disappointed and will never buy perfume form this site again.
2,"I'm not a big X fan, so...","A collection of essays, photos, album covers, and assorted flotsam; Forming doesn't know what it wants to be. For every insightful look at the state of performance art at the dawn of the Punk Rock scene in Los Angeles, there's a glamour shot of Exene Cervenska. The apparent Queen of Punk Rock, Cervenska dominates the book in content. When other writers aren't tossing about her name, pictures of her dominate the page. Meanwhile, she and John Doe basically interview themselves for the fifth and final essay of the book.For those who are unimpressed with X and all things Cervenska, there are still a few fun facts to know and tell provided in this book. However, Forming is not the documentation of this crucial musical/cultural ""scene"" that it pretends to be. (ISBN: 1889195448)"
3,"Well, I thought I'd like her, but...","...I don't. I've been collecting this series - the Diva series - because I loved the ""Gone Platinum"" and ""All that Glitters"" dolls. I definitely thought I wanted to round out my collection with this - ""Red Hot"". But when I saw her in the store, I was very disappointed. I don't know if it's all the red fringe. Normally I would like fringe, but it doesn't work for me here. Maybe is the stark contrast of the white gloves with the red fringe. Maybe it's the way the red of the dress doesn't go well with the doll's skin tone. I don't know, but whatever it is, this doll did not appeal to me, to the extent that I have a series with a missing version."
5,The most played with toy in our house!,"My Mom bought this for Christmas when our son was 14-months old. He plays with it in some form every day. Either the blocks or the people or sometimes he will just carry around the sound panel pushing the buttons on that. He is now 20-months and can sit on it and ride it by himself. It isn't a very good shape sorter because the shapes will fit into any slot. When we first received it the sounds scared him so we had to put that part away for a couple months, but now he loves it. This is easily his favorite toy (second only to books.)"
2,Not the best...,"This is not the best riding toy I could have picked. First the positives- this comes with a bunch of extra toys, people and blocks that fit other Chicco toys, and can be used as a shape sorter. I also found it lots cheaper on another web site. The negatives- The seat is not fit tightly in its hinges, so it falls off easly, but my son is not able to put it back on, so I have to, *every time*. Also, the play station on the handle only has one volume, LOUD, so loud in fact that it scares him and he wont play with it. I would advise to pick a diffrent car."
3,Has issues!,"My 2 year old loved the music, building blocks and general features however there are in my opinion two main flaws with this product. Firstly the seat does not stay attached if it is flipped over to the toy section. Maybe this was an error with the unit we purchased but I was forever having to clip it back into the side attachments. Secondly the seat is not solid and my child cracked it when he jumped on it. I did tape the crack but he still managed to snag a piece of skin leaving a nasty cut. Needless to say I threw it out after this incident. So it only lasted 5 months."
3,It's okay but there's better ones,"We bought this for our daughter when she was about 14 months old. She likes the electronic buttons but it's hard for her to drive by herself, and when we push her the front moves so it goes astray. If given the chance, would not buy this again."
5,IF LOVING WAS A CRIME DID IT...,"As a big reggae fan I was never turned on to to Buju Banton until recently. I never knew who he was. NOW I DO... He has a unique style and I LOVE IT. Can't wait to see him on tour. PLEASE COME TO Phoenix, AZ, USA. ""Make My DAY""One Love, Redsista"
3,"Good album, but a bit soft around the edges","This album is very well produced, with great sound quality and if it suits your musical tastes you will dig it. I guess it is reggae, but some of these songs could easily be in a Disney movie. I am not trying to write a negative review about an album with positive vibes, but if you are on the hunt for raw, roots reggae I would look elsewhere."
3,Nicely written work,"I like this book, well written and just enough to ""wet one's appetite"" and may be good for someone just getting into the subject. I do find it lacking in depth and although some interesting ""Sacred Geometry"" ideas are included, that tended to cloud the purpose (to me) it is no comparison to Goodwin's ""Numerology, The Complete Guide"" which I have been using for years.A fun and informative book, but for serious practitioners it falls short."
5,The Importance of a Personal Blueprint,"Imagine knowing who you were when you were born. This is your soul number, which is easy to determine with Numerology and The Divine Triangle. This book helps you understand life lessons that you are here to learn, and provides details for personal years and months. This is the only book on numerology that I have read, and it is simple and complete. Thank you!"
4,Detailed,A friend introduced me to Astrology and Numerology I this book very unique and I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Pretty Good,I liked most of the book but some of it was a little too much. I love the numerology and tarot combination.
5,Great Book!,"Reading Numerology and the Divine Triangle, has opened portals of wisdom to me like no other book of it's kind! The insights provided, coupled with it's easy to read language, make it a must read for any serious student of Numerology. It's Esoteric applications are the most inspiring and illuminating. My copy has become so dog eared that my friends laugh when they see it! My life, along with the lives of others, has been enriched! I can only hope that software will be available for this dynamic tool soon!"
5,the bible of Numerology (and a companion book),The book Numerology and the Divine Triangle is widely regarded as the bible of numerology. The book Numerology by Ed Peterson is the ultimate companion book.
5,Wonderful!,I'm new to kitting and just started reading the book and working the sample. The book is very well written. I feel as if I'm sitting in a knitting class learning something new with a great teacher. I highly recomend this book to any newby to kitting
5,Great system,"When I first got this book, I thought oh-no, but I went through it step by step and this system for knitting seam free jumpers is fool proof, my whole family has at least one now. I hate sewing together jumper pieces, especially sleeves, but dont do it anymore, with this system i still knit any jumper I want from other patterns but finish with a raglan sleeve (which fits better anyway), it just makes so much more sence, this book lives in my knitting basket. As others have said before my ""if you knit, you need this book""!"
5,MORE THAN JUST A BOOK,"As a new knitter i bought this book to help me knit my first sweater. I learn't much more than that from Jackie! She walks you through the entire process step by step from start to finish. (almost as if she is the room with you). What this book doesn't do is teach you to knit, it works on the presumption that you already have those basic skills!! What this book does though is give you the freedom to create/design your own sweaters from any yarn and in any pattern using the techniques in her book borrowed from Elizabeth Zimmerman but taught patiently and precisely by Jacueline Fee. If this book doesn't have the answer for your current project then you can contact her via her Yahoo group and either Jackie or one of her dedicated supporters in the group will help answer your questions!! So what are you waiting for? your knitting will never be the same!"
2,"Disappointed- Ugly, Uninspired Sweaters","This is the only book that I have sent back after on-line ordering. I am an experienced knitter who will only spend the time knitting a sweater to produce something beautiful and exceptional, usually with set in sleeves. I found the patterns in the book uninspiring, unflattering, and dated so I would not have any desire to knit any of the sweaters in the book, and therefore no desire to benefit from the techniques. It is not simply a question of being out of date, although that does not help, as all of the sweaters are raglans or yoke design- not a flattering or fashionable design for most women."
5,Techniques for knitting sweaters,I've found this old favorite and the sweater sampler that's included a great way to learn/relearn all the techniques needed for knitting a sweater from the simplest garter and stockinette stitches to how to add a pocket and do intricate stitches.
2,I don't get the rave reviews,"Perhaps the rave reviews were from students in her workshop who also bought the book. This book has too many words and no where near enough illustrations. In a sincere desire to be thorough, the book over-complicates many things that are actually quite simple. The actual sweater patterns are really pretty ugly. This is what happens when someone with no real colour or fashion sense designs--the garment is technically very well done but what's the point if it looks awful?I really don't get all the rave reviews.I borrowed this book from my public library and I'm glad I did because I would never buy it!!!"
5,perfect summer perfume!,"After smelling every perfume at sephora one day, I decided to go with Escada's Island Kiss. It's a fruity, young scent that is perfect for a pretty spring/summer day. Everytime I smell it, I immediately think 'yummy.'This smell is more about fruity fun. If you're looking for something that is more professiona, expensive, or mature smelling, you might want to go with something else."
5,Will Downing At His Best!,"Of the 5 CDs by Will Downing, this is the BEST!! I played my first copy so much that I wore it out, and my second copy is not far behind!! This CD is definitely for lovers. It gives you music for celebration of love, to show appreciation for love, and will be a constant reminder of how much you are in love. If I could have, my entire wedding reception would have been dedicated to Will Downing because this is the CD that my fiance and I courted with. If you are a TRUE ""Willy D."" fan, like I am, buy this CD to add to your collection. (Will's #1 fan, YM)"
5,terrific,"another great recording by the singer. Great listening,l a must have for your collection so purchase it and listen to it."
3,Interesting,"Being a black member of the church for twenty years, I felt that the book didn't probe deep enough into its subjects. I have interviewed many blacks that left the church due to discrimination and lack of empathy for the plight of the black memeber in the church. I found myself wondering if the questions were tailered to not grasp the deep emotional feelings of its interviewee. More could have been asked that would have brought about a true insight to the delima of blacks in in the church and demographics could have have been widen to get a clearer picture."
2,"good rails, but...","The rails work great, but they do not come with the rails to hold the mattress up. You need to have the rails to hold the mattress up because this bed does not require of fit a boxspring. My dad had to make these rails to hold the mattress up out of wood. Works great now, but make sure you have these rails handy when converting to the full size bed!"
1,baby gift,"This was a baby shower gift, the parents have not had the opportunity to use this item. I would recommend the item once the parents use it."
5,Appear to be as described,These were purchased to go with our crib. Ordered now in case not available at later date. Once used will update review. They appear solid.
4,Fantastic Transformation!,"One of the bolts was just a touch difficult to get in place, but once that was done, the transformation of the crib into a beautiful bed was complete. Honestly, our son's bed is now nicer than our own bed, no joke. The only reason I did not give 5 starts was the difficulty of putting the one bolt in place, which I read that some other people had similar difficulty."
5,Sturdy and Easy to Assemble,If you liked your DaVinci Crib (and I loved mine) you'll like these bedrails that turn it into a full size bed. They are sturdy and the mattress sits right down onto the rails with no metal in sight. It is also easy to assemble. My husband changed my son's toddler bed into this full sized bed in less than twenty minutes. A very good product overall and the value isn't bad considering you'd pay more than this to buy a whole new bed.
5,Great workmanship,"We haven't actually used this yet, but purchased it for my daughter's crib along with purchasing the crib. Like the crib itself, the kit looks sturdy and well-made. It comes with all the necessary attachments."
1,how exactly are rails helpful without THE SLATS?,"Is it really too much to ask for the company to include the horizontal slats?I read the reviews, but somehow didn't understand why people were talking about the box spring. The answer is: there are no slats. You just end up with the bed frame. As some posters point out a box spring may not cut it. OR you may not want to buy a box spring. It just seems really lazy/perverse/obnoxious to me that the company doesn't include slats?!!!"
3,"Nice look, but holds only a moderate amount of weight!","Bought these rails to convert my sons 3-in-1 bed to a full size bed. I had concerns at first because these rails only have two screws per end to attach to the frame and no underneath middle supports; however, after trying it out with a full-size boxspring and pretty thick mattress it does well. -no jumping on the bed though!! As long as the boxspring fits the frame exactly it will work well for a couple years but will not hold the weight as he gets bigger or I would say 50-75 lbs max, although my mother-in-law used it for about a week with no problems-i would reccommend just watching it."
3,Not as good as the show!,Family Rivalry is one of the best episodes of Avonlea! But something about it doesn't work as a book.....I read the book years ago.......The story is basically about the childhood fued between Alec and His brother....Andrew Alec's nephew has a loyalty to both his father and uncle and try's to stay out of it! Trust me this is one you should just watch on TV!
4,this handsome ken is a must have!!!,This ken doll look's like Pierce Brosnan and handsome too!!! This Ken is great collection both to doll collectors and James Bond 007 collectors. If you like James Bond and Pierce Brosnan..then this doll is definitley worth getting!! PIERCE BROSNAN THE ONE AND ONLY HANDSOME JAMES BOND EVER!!! Looking forward to get this one.
3,Beautiful 007 Set...but smokey smell detracts from its beauty,"I was really excited to receive this set and was thrilled when I got it this afternoon. Ken as James is very handsome and reminds me a lot of the character/actor he is portraying (i.e. James Bond/Pierce Bronson). Barbie is glamorous as a ""Bond Girl"". I'm going to have fun showing these two off in my collection of dolls. However, I am a bit disappointed that the dolls smell like smoke - which tells me the dolls were kept in a house that has a smoker or smokers in, and smoke smell in anything is not good at all. It detracts from the beauty of the product. In the future, I will be very careful about ordering from the vendor whom I bought the dolls from. I'm a non-smoker and suffer from terrible allergies - smoke is not my friend. However, as far as the dolls are concerned, I would buy them again in a heartbeat from a non-smoke environment vendor."
3,007 and Barbie,mY OPINION:*TOO EXPENSIVE*BARBIE'S HAIR GOT MESSED UP QUICKLY*NOT APROPRIATE FOR YOUNGER CHILDEREN
5,Gomorrah's season in the abyss,The album EC matured into one of the heaviest hardcore bands around. Both lyricaly and instrumentaly this record serves as a call to arms for people to consider what they are doing regardless of sXe. In my opinion EC best album.
5,Arrived as seller promised,This tape came in good condition and arrived within the time framed promised by the seller. Someone I would definitely do business with in the future.
5,All about Rocket in Slowwww Going episode...,"Sorry to say I have to find this video. Oh, oh, oh, we have some good and some bad 2 episodes: Slowwww Going and Over The Hill Hero.Never see what it came from Christmas, hehehe, for me!Michael Higham"
4,Best Guide To Identify Fish...,If your trying to find out what is on the end of your line... I would suggest this book. It has good illustrations of many fish and a few other interesting facts about them. It also covers the whole gulf area rather than selecting a state or two. The only draw back is it doesn't include great detail on how to catch each particular fish.
5,Fantastic book,"This book gives you great, concise information about the fish of the Gulf. Now I'm able to target the fish that will be to my liking. It even informs you about the food value of each fish. I'm a fisherman that fishes and loves to have a great meal afterwards. You can't get any better than that. Fantastic!!!!!"
3,Jeff,"I like this book. The descriptions of the fish are good. It is an easy book to use and well laid out. The main thing I would have wanted to be improved upon was the discussion of where the fish could be found. I would have liked a little more specificity here. If I want to fish for a particular species, this book doesn't narrow down where I could expect to find it very well."
4,Fishing is Fun Again,"I love to fish, but most of my experience is on the Great Lakes.Suddenly, I began fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, and became literally ""lost at sea"" when it came to the fish I was pulling out of the water. I didn't recognize them (What IS that???), knew nothing about them. . . and was wary of them because most (ok, all) of them have teeth, if not poisonous spines!Enter this book.After reading through it several times--and despite being a field guide it is wonderfully readable--I now recognize my catches, and even catch fish more often due to the helpful angling tips.The illustrations couldn't be better, and the organization of the information is clear and sensible. I'd recommend this for anybody: an adult fisherman like me or even a child who sits on the end of the dock with a pole."
5,Don't get fined???????,"With so many restrictions and diffrent types of fish in the gulf, the last thing you want is an illegal fish. ""Sport Fish of the Gulf"" is on my vessel when I fish!"
2,Bad book written by a brit,4th edition with lots of errors. British English is awkward. Author assumes everything is clear and understandable while it isn't. Very dry book and not recommended.
5,Nudibranch Behavior,I have learned a lot by reading this book. I have learned to pay more attention to what the nudibranchs are doing having learned what the behaviour means. Who knew that such a seemingly lowly creature would have so much to teach us! I can't wait for my next dive trip to observe more nudi behaviour!
3,Very wordy...,"I bought this book, but ended up not really reading it - it read more like a text book than a quick pick up and look at book (like some of the other reference books about fish)."
4,this CD rocks!,"This CD is awesome, i heard of Shootyz when i got a tape sampler from a local record store, i heard faithfull, that is the song that made me become a fan, since then i have liked their music, and i have every CD, and this one i like the best, Shootyz Groove can rock with the bet of them that is for sure!"
2,Not one of his best,"Generally, I like to read a series of books in sequence. I read McBain's The Last Best Hope last year, not knowing it was part of a series. It really was ""the best"" and I hope it isn't the last. So -- I ran right out and bought as many of the earlier books as I could. This one, Rumpelstiltskin is, well, just OK. I'm almost finished and I'm only reading it until the end because I don't like to start a new one until I've finished what I'm reading. Frankly, the story is not engaging enough to keep me all that interested. The characters and dialogue, like all of McBain's characters and dialogue are interesting, but the story -- this is the first time I've read a murder mystery where I hardly care whodunit."
5,A classic text.,"This is a classic text which presents a study of the structural forms and cultural patterns of the Japanese living in rural areas from the late feudal period to the 1960's. Particular emphasis is placed on agriculture, family life, village life, and the governmental forms of hamlet versus village. The chapter on the unchanging mentality of the Japanese farmer is very enlightening, and can be easily compared to similar attitudes of farmers throughout the world. This is a highly recommended and unfortunately out of print book which should be read by any and all students of Japanese culture and history."
4,Save it for a rainy day..,I was hoping this would come with a liner inside but it doesnt. It repels the rain nicely but if it's cold out make sure to wear a sweatshirt or something warm under it.
2,Roll up hood design is crappy,"I mainly bought this because I wanted something with a roll up hood, packable, cheap and reliable. Main thing was a roll up hood. I wear boonie hats or watch caps so I wont be using the hood unless I lose my hat. Rolling up the hood makes the jacket look like crap, and it feels like crap on your neck. I have water proof jackets without roll up hoods, so this was a waste of money for me. I got it cheap enough so I might as well keep it, but it was very disappointing. This was a feature that I thought would be fairly straight forward, but I will probably stay away from Marmot jackets in the future unless I see it first. The only thing keeping me from giving this a 1 star rating is I have not actually used it in the rain yet, so it may be great in that regard. This is mainly a condemnation of the roll up hood design."
5,Worth it,I'm a tall skinny guy who usually has trouble finding quality clothes that fit. Although I was only able to get this jacket in one color (because only one color comes in medium-tall) I am more than happy with the jacket. It is light enough to fold up and be easily stuffed into a small pocket yet it keeps you dry and doesn't let the wind in at all.
3,"Like this jacket, but tears easily.","I bought this for my boyfriend and within a few months of wear already had several tears. Good company, but this rain jacket is a bit flimsy for the price."
2,Does not work at all,"I have cystic acne, which is usually caused by bacteria and I thought that this would help clear it since it is a bacteria fighting cleansing soap. My face still looks exactly the same. It has no affect and I have been using it for over a month. I am glad I didn't spend much money on it."
2,"Might be a good soap, but it didn't work for me.","I got this soap because I occasionally break on on my chest and back. The reviews of this soap were mostly favorable, so I bought 5 bars. It does remove oil on the skin and leaves your skin feeling dry, so a moisturizer after the fact might be good. As far as it curing my outbreaks, sadly it has not worked, I work up a generous lather and scrub the area really good with a cloth and wash it off with cool water per the directions, still I break out.I have 5 bars of this and will continue to use it. Perhaps it works better the longer you use it."
2,Didn't work,This didn't work to help clear up my acne or reduce any of the oil on my skin. It feels nice when you wash your face with it but thats about it.
2,Baby Powder,"This cologne is not really my thing, it is extremely strong, so make sure you use only a little, otherwise people will think you just powdered your butt...."
3,The obscure world of Laibach,"To the western world, Laibach can seem, and come off as a little neo-millitant. I say,and use this term, only because to someone who has no experience with the group might see them as facists. When in fact they are the EXACT OPPOSITE! Don't let the khaki/officer cloths, or the millitant sounding horns lead you to a negative assumption of what they stand for. As westerners, we have a hard time relating to such pride. We are just over 200 years old in the States! We know nothing of struggles.Laibach puts on an interesting display of their background, and Slovenia in this artsy, and obscure video. Iscem Slovene!"
5,"Excellent guide to low tech, self sufficient living","The book came quite quickly. It is in excellent condition. Straight forward discussion, intruction, and exampling in ""what"" and ""How"" to live quite comfortably off the grid."
5,"Great book, arrived in perfect condition.","Recommend read for anyone considering simplifying there life. Not strictly a ""how-to"" also has a great narrative feel. 10 stars if I could."
1,So stupid,"Don't bother with this book unless catching and killing turtles for food, raising and slaughtering rabbits in your basement and making your own indoor moonshine appeals to you. If those are the kinds of things you are interested in, this book is for you. If you are homeless, a hermit or a nutcase your might enjoy this book as well. Otherwise, don't waste your money. Looking for ways to reduce, recycle, reuse, and re-purpose to save money and go green, I thought this book might be helpful. It wasn't. It is so ridiculous."
1,SIMPLE MINDED SHAM!,"This book is a joke! Sure you can live on next to nothing if, like the author, you own a house free and clear. The book tells us little more than how to skin and cook rabbits. And the author claims you can raise these rabbits along with chickens in your basement with no foul odors! Possum Pablam!"
1,Dominion over all,It is a sad commentary that people celebrate the life of a person that participates in the extermination of any and all creatures that cross her path. There are simply too many of us and too few of the wild creatures any longer to use them for our convenience. Shame on her and those that support her.
2,Not exactly,"There are lots of ideas in this book BUT1. They need to be updated. I've written my own version for this millenium.2. Do not take her chapter on law literally. With caller ID, you will be caught if you make abusive phone calls and she is hypocritical to say ""be sure you are right"" and then advocate property damage as a way of getting people's attention.YMMV"
1,Stupid books Ive read in 2010,"This will be added to the top ten worst books Ive ever read in my life and a huge moneywaster for anyone who likes to live a ""frugal"" life. Sure her Dad is thiftly--apparently thats so he can drink more hooch and not be worried about having anything pesky like a ""job"" or paying taxes. The whole ""freedom"" lifesyle she shoves in your face in this books is a complete load of bulls***. Oh and if a bill collecter or lawyer or any type law enforcement type is harrasing you--just go to their house and toss a rock or two in their window or slash a few tires--no big deal to these people! No wonder Mom fled this family early on. Dont waste your money on this crap."
1,Save your money - don't buy this book,She has a few funny one-liners but there is no usable information in this book. I'm sure she has a good laugh every time this books sells. I really wish there was a way to get my money back.
4,Possum Living,"""Possum Living"" is a quick read with humor and plenty of reminders of what is really necessary for living on this planet. It may not have improved my ability to live cheaply but it was encouragement for the continuation of what I am doing. I enjoyed the youthful experiences she shared and her reflection on the lifestyle 30 years later.S. ComleyAlabama"
3,"okay book, not my cup of tea","When I ordered this book I thought it was going to be more to my taste. It just doesn't appeal to me, in the fact that I though it was going to be more about living out in the wilderness more so than living really close to Philly. The title doesn't lie about the author having hardly any money, though, and it's interesting to read about how they really do live with hardly anything coming in at all. I'm not saying it's a terrible book, but definitely check it out at a library first if you're thinking about buying it. That being said, there are some neat things in it that do get my attention, with chapters about meat and fishing being the standouts. Not a bad book, just not for me."
4,"A fun, light read","This book is more of a homesteading memoir (from before memoirs became so popular) than it is an informational guide. That said, it's very amusing, especially when you realize it's written by an 18 year old dropout who later went to work for NASA."
4,Self-Sufficient Wannabee's,"I recently read ""Possum Living"" on the web, in an electronic format, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I wish a more recent edition was available, as much of the information the 1978 edition was based on current conditions. Dolly's reference to making turtle soup, for instance, from a Leatherback found in Florida is, today, politically incorrect. Also, considering the growing popularity of vegetarianism, some may find her ""homesteading recipes"" slightly offensive (anything with four legs, fur, or feather's, is fair game in the name of survival). Overall it is a worthwhile read, and her sense of humor is refreshing. For those intent on pursuing a more self-sufficient lifestyle, and want more up-to-date information, I highly reccommend the book ""Mortgage Free - Radical Stratagies for Home Ownership"" by Rob Roy. ..."
3,Interesting,"This was an interesting read, but this is NOT the place I'd go looking for tips on ""living well without a job."""
4,A Great Read,This book is a good and fast read.I loved her ideas and her humor. It was surprising how wise she was at such a young age.Great ideas though as an animal lover I skipped the butchering parts. But that comes with self-sustainability.I first read a library copy and liked it so much I bought a copy for myself and one for a friend.
1,bad attitude,"I hated everything about this book. It had a few helpful tips, but when the author seems to be proud of the fact that she's lazy and doesn't want to work, well that doesn't quite settle well with me. I also found some of the content to be a little unsettling and bordering on the edge of eating out of garbage cans."
3,Interesting...not as good as I was hoping.,"I thought this book would be about living frugally...this is more about living like a homeless person that takes from society. If anyone wants my copy, I'll sell it to you for half the price. It's worth a read, and some good recipes for moonshine, but the rest of the book wasn't very interesting to me."
2,would have worked in the 1970s but won't work now,"Freed writes about living with her father in a quasi-rural area of Pennsylvania circa 1974-78 for little or no money. As I read the book all I could think was that one would have to own their own home in order to make the suggestions work. Sure enough, I then got to the chapter where Freed wrote exactly that.The problem is that the house she lived in was a sheriff's sale that took her and her father two years to obtain for well under market value. They put a lot of sweat equity into fixing it, but try getting their fixes past a modern zoning apparatchik today? I doubt it!Perhaps one could buy cheap land and put one or more trailers on it, but even at today's depressed land values unimproved lots are still far more expensive and would require years trapped in the rat race. I doubt those at wits' end really have an ability to wait that long. Perhaps if one combines it with The Secret and wishes REALLY hard..."
2,"Quaint, But of Little Value","Apparently I am in the minority, but I have a hard time understanding the high reviews for this book. It was neither technical where you would learn a lot of ""how to"" info nor a very interesting story. It is a very casual, quick read on the musings of somebody who lived a frugal lifestyle for a limited period of time in her life. Reading it was not terrible, but it was completely uneventful. I'd rather have my time and money back because I learned and enjoyed little from reading this book. Ultimately even the author abandoned this lifestyle which says a lot to me."
3,interesting story,Not as much information as I was looking for but a very good story.Most of us don't have the luxury of living in a location this book is useful forbut a good read none the less.
3,Not Convincing,"I wanted to like this book, but it was not to be. The historical background is woven nicely into the book but the narrative suffers. The story/history is told in an awkward present tense which does not flow well or engage the reader as it should. The verbage has occasional bursts of vivid description which show promise, but the main character seems to suffer an identity crisis. She alternates from royalty to ordinary with unusual choices in her mode of expression.I shall continue to look for a good, well-written, engaging book about Hatshepsut for our family. This one will not do. The three stars are for the quality of the historical backdrop."
2,"We thought this book was boring , 8th grade should read it.","We would not recommend the book: His Majesty Queen Hatshepsut to read aloud, but other wise it might be alright. The vocabulary was hard and the story was diffucult to follow when somebody was reading out loud. This book seemed boring because of all the Ancient Egyptian Society facts. We might recommend this book for an older age group such as 8th or 9th grade or someone who likes to read about history. It is not that much fun for a 6th grader to read."
4,Good read aloud book for a class,I read this book last year to my 5th grade Waldorf School class during our study of ancient Egypt. The class loved it. They were engaged and since I read it I was able to answer their questions. It really enlivened our trip to the Met when we sat in a gallery full of her images.
4,We thought this book was too complicated for 6 graders,As a group we would recommend this book for 7 graders+ because it has hard words to understand. The book has a good plot but in the first half of the book nothing really happened. If you get this book for a class buy one for everyone because it's easier to understand the vocabulary. You can a learn lot of new vocabulary and a lot about Ancient Egypt.
2,Hatty is batty,"Our group grades His Majesty, Queen Hatshepsut 2 stars out of 5. The book gives good information, however, it skipped around a lot. It's more of a history book than a regular story book."
3,So-So,"I am very interested in Egyptian History, but this book was very boring. Maybe the fact that reading it was an assignment for school, I don't know. It portrayed Hatshepsut getting more mature throughout the book very well, but the last few chapters seemed very hurried, as though you were reading the epilouge (is that spelled correctly?)If you really loved historical fiction(i-heart-fantasy), this book would be HEAVEN for you."
2,boring book,"Our group thinks that His Majesty, Queen Hatshepsut should get 2 stars out of 5 because the book was really boring at some parts and had to many details. The book was really long and boring! The good thing about the book was that it had a lot of big words some we never heard of some that means we learned somthing. In conclusion we think the book was ""OK""..."
5,Efficient Self-help with self hypnosis simply explained.,"This book is really fantastic. The author tells you what to do to help yourself recover from any discomfort through self-hypnosis. It is efficient as it explains everything in simple words. the book also has chapter that are well balanced and arranged. I think that the aim is to be holistic, which explains the title. Professionally done. I believe people can help themselves at a fraction of the cost of seeing a professional. The subconscious mind will do it all for you. Just follow the advices in the book."
3,Not the best Diamond has to offer,"I love Diamond nuts, but need to economize. They are quite expensive in the grocery store, so I thought I would check these out. Unfortunately, the nuts are on the small size and don't have that usual robust ""Diamond"" flavor. So while I'd really recommend any Diamond product, this package seems to be for products that are less than their usual high quality."
4,lita cd,this item i almost thought i would not get because they did not respond right away about it . but it was in the shape desribed . and it was nice to have for my cd collection .
5,Ultimate Lita,"Great 80's rock. This Lita's first solo album after the Runaways. It rocks! It also includes the classic duet with Ozzy called ""Close Your Eyes Forever"" Well worth the money."
5,Excellent!!,Don't listen to the putzes who tell you Lita can't rock because she's female and sexy as hell. It's sexist bullsh*t. She IS a lady who is sexy as hell BUT she rocks too and this is a great CD with some killer cuts and a helluva lot of awesome blistering guitar. Lita f*cking rocks!!
5,The ultimate Donna collection for the buck,"Many more people have bought the On The Radio and Endless Summer cd's, which is respectable if you are a casual fan. But for only about $5 more, you can get this collection of all of the essentials. There are a few hits missing (The Woman In Me, Walk Away, Dinner With Gershwin and Love's About To Change My Heart noticeably) but if you aren't someone with her entire collection, settle for this. This anthology covers every album she cut between 1975-1991 (even 1981's I'm A Rainbow, which didn't get an official release until 1996, 3 years after this album) and is a great introduction to her career. Of course many of these tracks are edits (as the originals of songs like Love To Love You Baby and Try Me I Know We Can Make are in excess of 16 minutes) but even as edits, you still hear the majesty these songs have to order. If you are enchanted by this collection, start getting her other albums to hear even more."
4,A Talent That Goes Beyond Disco...,"Most music anthologies have as many bad tracks on them as good ones, so I was reluctant to buy this album. However, Summer's official greatest hits album (""On The Radio"") doesn't have her post-disco hits on it, so I bought the ""Donna Summer Anthology"" and crossed my fingers.My gamble paid off. ""Anthology"" not only contains her familiar hits from later years, but it also contains gems I've never heard before, like ""I'm A Rainbow"", ""I Don't Wanna Get Hurt""--and a surprisingly good rendition of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"".Donna Summer will never shake her disco legacy, but we often forget this woman has range! ""Anthology"" proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt."
5,A must-have,"This CD has all of Donna Summer's greatest hits, plus other lesser-known songs. For me, the song ""I Love You"" -- which I had never heard before -- is worth the entire purchase price of the CD. Her rendition of ""Don't Cry for me Argentina"" is absolutely brilliant, and the Caribbean-sounding song ""Unconditional Love"" is very uplifting. No other singer can compare with Donna. She's the best."
4,Even Publisher's Weekly Reveals Itself-See editorial review,"Mr. McGowan presents a carefully researched book that is not as bombastic as some would have you believe. At no time does he offer up anything that goes beyond this simple argument: Journalists are not doing their job.In other words, those who will claim of this book that it is trying to pick a fight with particular segments (demographics) of our society are not reading closely enough. The only group that should take offense is journalists. The rest of us should feel outraged after reading this book, and you know, we would if we didn't already know what was going on.Still, it is compelling to read about the specifics and hear the words of some of the individuals involved. One might think that with the books ""Bias"" and ""Slander"" out, this book is overkill, but it is less personal and more from a quantitative perspective."
4,an account into the 'liberal bias',"The term 'liberal bias' is often referred to the media. In Coloring the News, William McGowan explains the topic. He looks at how there has been bias in areas like race, gender, immigration, sexual orientation, and the number games by siting several specific examples of how the issues have not been accurately been reported by the media or in cases in which represiala to articles have been hidden towards the back section of newspapers. McGowan then ends with reasons why such bias exist."
5,Bias in the news exposed,"For some time, most of us knew, or at least suspected, that the newsrooms were heavily biased towards a liberal ideology. But until I read this book, I didn't realize just how bad it has gotten. PC dogma has descended on our society, and the newsrooms have become the leading enforcers of this new doctrine.The book details many examples where the media is no longer just reporting the news, but instead, actively trying to shape the news and promote an ideology by omitting facts and accentuating stories (often fabricating stories) that support liberal viewpoints."
5,A Timely book,This book is jam packed with information. This book should be required reading for every college student.
3,"not the whole story, Billy","Suggesting that the press is liberal by looking at journalists is a little like suggesting the automotive industry is left wing by observing the work force. There are, of course, the CEOs and board of directors who decide what to make and how much. In viewing the press Mcgowan ignores the editors and corporate owners who went for Bush 2:1 last election. They of course have the ultimate say in what is reported and those distortions can be, and have been, more pernicious. Moreover, their bias is a market bias that seeks not to offend not because of a liberal bias but because of a bias for the bottom line."
4,Too bad this is out of print...,"because Heavy Hands is an excellent, effective exercise system that is not reliant on apparatus. With just a pair or two of dumbells you are good to go. This makes Heavy Hands especially suited to those who travel or who have limited storage space. I wish that there were video tapes available because the only criticism I have is that the diagrams in the book aren't always the easiest thing to understand. That criticism isn't limited to just this book, though, conveying how to do a motion through still pictures is always difficult."
3,pretty good,I just played it and it's pretty good. the colores are great and it's a pretty cute game although I hear the old one is better. I haven't played it so I don't know much to say but it's pretty good. It's what comes to you. You might find it better than the classic for SNES.
1,this game is great if its cheaper,this game is like any other bust a move games and i believe that this item should me only 20 bucks. if this cost any more then that i recommend u shouldnt buy it. all the moves tricks colors are all the same to me. i personally give this a 5 STAR rating but looking at the price... well... u know...
4,just ok,The bust a move series is great in general. I was a little disappointed in this version though. Bust a Move 99 and B.A.M. 4 are a whole lot better.
1,Didn't Help My Daughter's Negative Emotions One Bit,"I bought this book based on the review hoping it would help my 26 year old daughter. After reading the first few chapters, she brought it to me and said ""I can't seem to get anything out of this. You want to read some of it and see what you think"". I browsed through each chapter reading a little of each chapter. It made no sense to me, and I was very bored with it. I said to myself, ""If someone really needs help with negative emotions, I can't imagine how this book would help them. If someone is looking for a simple, down to earth book that is easily understood, this is not the book for them."" Maybe this would help someone who is highly educated and used to reading this kind of stuff, but for someone looking for basic answers in a simple, easy readable form, I don't think this book is for them."
1,The true believer becomes a headshrinker,"This book is a mishmash of half-formed Freudian sound bites wrapped around a framework of Bible-belt Revival Christianity. I have never had higher hopes for a book based on a title, and never been more deeply disappointed in the resulting contents.Persons incapable of critical thought or reasoned behaviour may find this book deeply comforting. I wrote my purchase of this book off as a learning experience and threw it away. I found Master's criticism of ""psychobabble"" particularly ironic, since the book is a rambling unfocused series of babbles."
1,Republished - original came out in 2004,"I bought this book because the Amazon information says it's new (released 1/31/12). But in reality, this work was originally published in 2004 by Avon books, this is a reprint by Harper Publishing. It's a good story but if you read it in 2004 you don't need to buy it again."
4,Dale Brown flies again,I read his books as soon as I can when they are released.His technological outlook is outstanding.Worth waiting for.
4,DREAMLAND STRIKE ZONE,Another great Brown / DeFelice military yarn! Once you start reading this you will not put it down. Quick read with plenty of action.
1,It's getting worse.,"The only way this series can be saved is if David Brent takes over as manager in Season 9. This will bookend the whole series with Brent opening and closing the entire sitcom. Gervais and Merchant can help raise the quality of the writing and Christoper Guest and Fred Willard should be brought in as characters somewhere as Spinal Tap is the whole reason why The Office exists in the first place anyway. Otherwise, no one will remember the great work done in the first six seasons but instead how bad the last three are."
2,Amazon doesn't know how to pack this,"This set is similar to the other previous seasons, a cheap cardboard sleeve with plastic/cardboard insert. I knew this when I ordered it. But what I didn't expect was the beating it'd take while arriving. There is damage to the corners, visible through the packaging. I'm not sure if it's because the product itself is just shoddy packaging or it was Amazon. But I'm going to try a 2nd time with a replacement."
5,awesome,"this shipped very fast and came very early. very happy, bran new great price. look in to this product, you wont be dissapointed"
3,"Still smart, but the edge is gone....","I'm still a big fan of the show. From Season 1 on it's been witty and original. But this past season really hurt the program. Someone else said it damaged the legacy and that could be true. Perhaps losing Steve Carell was a big blow? Perhaps the story lines are just played out? Either way, the show just seems to have lost its steam. I heartily recommend anyone who loves intelligent, timely TV programming to pick up any of the prior seasons. Seasons 3-5 are as good as it gets. Season 8....just didn't do it for me. It was OK by most TV standards, but it doesn't live up to The Office as I know it."
2,The Office. season 8,"Painful transition from Michel to Andy. Granted Michel was a bozo and mostly clueless, Andy is annoying and pretentious. Was a big fan of the original BBC offering and it took me a while to warm up to Steve and the office gang and for the most part I am glad I stuck with it. I should have saved my money on season 8."
3,Christmas without Michael Scott,"As it has all season, The Office struggles in this episode to deliver the same awkward humor it had with Michael Scott.In this episode, the Christmas party has some humorous tension as alcohol abounds and Andy brings his new girlfriend, Jessica to the party. As Erin struggles to cope with Andy's new love, Darryl invites Val from the warehouse.The most enjoyable scenes of this episode were the ones that hearkened back to earlier seasons, as Jim and Dwight were back to their prankster ways. In an effort to curtail the pranking, Andy threatens to take away the Christmas bonus of the next person to get caught pranking, and he promises he'll give that bonus to the other. The new incentive reverses the prank game, as Jim and Dwight try desperately to trick the other into pranking them.This was a fun episode, but consistent with the entire season it struggles to live up to the show's better days."
5,Great season!,Great season! I Loved every show and I did not miss Michael Scott for some reason. I can't wait to buy season 9 now.
1,NOT downloadable,Probably great but i purchased the wrong one and can not download it......and streaming does not work on the train!
3,Great dvd shame about very poor packing,I love the office and always order from amazon!Sadly this DVD got to my door pretty much smashed! The DVDs are fine but only just however the DVD case is smashed beyond any repair!
4,"Still Clever, True Fan","I thought season 8 was an upswing in writing and the humor level was great. Andy and the office staff are hilarious. People nay-saying this season are just malcontents, because there is plenty of comedy. James Spader's Robert California is pretty gross, frankly, but other than that, I thought they knocked it out of the park this season. I only gave this season 4/5 stars, because I was bummed there weren't any episode commentaries on the dvd, which bummed me out. I love to hear what the cast has to say about the different episodes."
3,why oh why,Happy with the season 8 of the office..just why is it that every new season I buy there's one disk that's brand new that won't play??!!Quality control is a thing of the past..as long as they get your money there happy...
3,"Still a satisying show, but has lost it's true feeling","This season was just O.K. to me. It had lots of great scenes and funny moments, but the majority of the show was just.. meh. The whole time while watching the show, it's just felt to me like the producers were just a bit confused of what they wanted to do with the show. It's like, once Michael left, they just seemed unsure of where to take the show. Ever since Will Ferrel took the seat as manager, I've been a little confused. There's been too many different managers in the big seat, and that makes the viewer confused.Honestly, I wish they ended with Michael's goodbye episode. They can try and continue and hopefully succeed, but it'll never be the same when Michael isn't around."
3,meh,I love the office. However the last few seasons are getting kind of boring. I don't know why. It's a good thing they are doing their final season.
3,The show is feelingly worse without Michael,"I am a big fan of the office. Have watched all episodes. I am waiting for season 9. The problem with season 8 is that the big star, Michael, is not playing in it. This lowers that comedy quality significantly. Dwight and Jim are surely entertaining as characters, and somewhat Andy, but no one can be compared to the character of Michael, who basically built the show. To be fair it is still entertaining, after the first couple of episodes where they clearly where experimenting.... I still managed to watch the entire season. Good job, but people were so used to the old fashioned seasons were Michael was the main theme of the show. It is good, only comparatively worse than the previous seasons."
5,Christmas Present,"This was also a Christmas Present for my nephew and he loved this one also, he has not gotten back to me to tell me there was anything wrong with it so I imagine it is also a five star item."
4,Super funny!,"The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not EXACTLY the same without Michael Scott... but still, VERY funny.... will give you a TON of laughs! :) I definitely recommend it!!"
2,Downhill Slide for 'The Office',"I've tried hard to stick with this. After seeing the brit original version, it took me a while to warm to the american version...but I did. But this last year has totally sucked. Truthfully, I just can't stomach the character 'Andy Bernard', he's no good, and the actor should get out of here. I had an open order, but I'm canceling it due to lack of interest. Gone from being one of the best shows on tv, to one of the worst."
4,"Product is Great, the Season is average","I am a huge office fan, and was a little let down with this season. The DVD did come with some cool bonuses, aside from that it is as expected. My friends and i are split on Robert California. I bought it because i own seasons 1-7, bottom line."
5,Still Great !!!,"I am really enjoying this season so far. The character of Andy Bernard has alot of heart and he is willing to go the extra mile for the team. Hopefully people will stay and enjoy the show, even though the lead character is gone. I don't feel like they are trying to replace Michael Scott. I don't think you can do that. They are keeping things funny and interesting."
4,As Good As It Can Be....,"This season was as good as it could have been with Steve's departure.I did enjoy all the twists and turns throughout.If this were a ""pilot"" season for the show and we knew that there never was a Michael Scott, this would have been a decent first season....But, after saying that, there is definitely something that is still missing from this season....Good but not great."
2,To be a better mom you need to be a better you,"Although this book had some good content...the over arching theme is to be a better mom you have to be a better you. Which is completely wrong thinking! To be a better mom we have to lean hard on the grace of God, be Christ-centered, and filled with His Spirit.This book also had the overarching theme that we all have child-centered homes and not Christ-centered homes. That frustrated me!It lacked real biblical substance.I know MOPS is more ""evangelistic lifestyle"" in their approach, but Paul was unashamed with the gospel and didn't have to water it down to ""win"" people for Christ. The cross is beautifully awful and balanced perfectly with truth and grace."
1,DANGEROUS PRODUCT,This is a very dangerous product that contains some of the worst chemicals to ones body . DO NOT USE AS I DEVELOPED MEDICAL CONDITIONS directly related to it requiring an emergency room visit.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,I needed to repair an upper denture that had cracked into two pieces. It did not keep the dentures from cracking into two pieces within a few days after the repair. Would not buy this product again.
1,Can I vote 0 stars?,"I have to echo Joseph's review and warn people to stay away from this book as well as any other books by Mary Summer Rain. The author has taken claims to a heritage that she knows nothing about. This book sells romanticized ""spirituality"" and is a fictional collection of Anasazi beliefs and chants, and should not be considered a true account."
3,On our own...,We each follow a path.. and sometime we do share what we feel by the written word.That doesn't however mean that HER words will fit into your words. Time and cultures have a definite imprint on our minds and souls. For some I do believe that Summer Rain's simplistic chants will have an effect and for many they won't. Its just that kind of a book.. personal. HER recalls of the ancient words.. not ours.. nor the archaeologists trying to understand the wherefores and the why.. is what she is sharing. We weren't there.. or were we?If it hits home.. you get the message.. if not... you've read another person's thoughts.
5,Jeff Bridges book Pictures,"This book is absolutely wonderful.Great photography and short quips re: each subject.A beautiful work of art.Arrived in perfect condition, and in a very timely manner."
5,Brilliant,"This book is fascinating and the pictures powerful and raw. I wouldn't even consider myself a huge Jeff Bridges or Hollywood fan, but this book still captivates me."
2,Disappointing collection,"I was hoping for much more from Bridges in this collection of on-set photos. With such a rare opportunity to capture his fellow actors candidly, he just didn't. When you think of the great films he's been a part of and how long he's been shooting photos, you'd think he's have a better collection. If he does, they didn't make into this book. Not recommended."
5,Clinical Textbook for Vet Techs,I found this textbook to be well written and well organized. The volume has a nice flow to it so you don't get bogged down in the reading. Excellent photos reinforce the written text. I haven't used the CD that came with it other than to check it out and see what was on it. If someone is thinking about becoming a vet tech and wanted to see what that entails. . .this would be a book to purchase to assist with that decision. I bought this book through Amazon's Textbook search.
2,Rarely used!,"Not very usefull, rarely used it.Wouldn't be much different if I never bought it, did not learn much from it."
3,Unnecessarily Wordy - Not For Use as a Practical Guide,"I recently started working in a veterinarian office to get clinical hours for my veterinary school application. I bought this book based on the Amazon reviews so that I could study and look a bit less clueless around the hospital :) The first chapter I read was on animal restraint, and it was very frustrating. I feel like the text was bloated to make some sort of length requirement because the chapter's sections go on and on with very little meat to it. (Do we really need it spelled out several times in excruciating detail why it's bad if an animal escapes or bites someone?) You'll get almost the same value from just reading the one sentence highlighted summaries sprinkled through the text as you do from reading the whole thing. Based off the many more positive reviews here, I guess the book may be more appropriate as a textbook, and less so for a practical guide for learning procedures you'll be expected to perform in a clinical setting."
2,very basic,"this book is very basic, if you have more than a year's work at a clinic you might be bored. A good beginner book for Vet Techs who dont have any in clinic experience."
5,GREAT BOOK,Love The Text Book it came brand new & Is what was promised & Def good for what it's for. I Def recommend this for someone looking for a Text online It's Just perfect!
4,Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians Sixth Edition,This book was as advertised and shipping was prompt and satisfactory. It is a very good book for veterinary technicians and the veterinarians as well. It includes many pictures that help the readers understand easily.
3,An attempt to regain his magic!,"I thought this album was very interesting. It seems obvious that JM was trying to make more serous music and oddly enough, it seem to almost work here. If you looking for the hits, steer away. But if your'e looking for complex themes and music from him, this is a good one. It is much better than Dance Naked which seems to be a similar attempt from Mellencamp. This album will make you think and hopefully appreciate JM ina different light compared to the Americana themes in his earlier work."
3,Good but....,"Good songs, some of his finest. The lyrics are mostly peace, love, kindness and toleration until the end when he mocks someone for their choice of footwear (""French Shoes""). The intolerance and mockery of this song renders hollow all of his peace love lyrics. I guess the guy can't help himself. Remember John: higher self, higher self."
5,Human Wheels great song (and album),"Human Wheels is a great song (and brilliant album). One of my favorite of all time and all genre. To me John's optimism offers the belief of great hope for all mankind and hopefully beyond. To come up with a solution you have to first identify the problem.From the smallest everyday frustration to the insurmountable, JM has eloquently accomplished it very nicely. An artist trying to make a difference."
4,Great Trip Back in Time,It is really neat to be able and get some of the songs that you do not hear on a regular basis. I plan on addings all 12 volumes to my collection.
3,order it in the winter,"quality of the product was sufficient given that it's packaged pretzels and chocolate (if you don't know what you're getting into, it's pretty much that: chocolate on the outside of a long pretzel stick), BUT. order it in the summer and expect to receive some very well heated chocolate. I open mine up (after letting it cool) to find a monstrosity of fused chocolate and snapped pretzel. I will be trying to order these again when the weather permits the transit of something with such a low melting point, and may update my review at that point."
3,Great but old,"I have been a high school English teacher for 8 years and I have used this book to help prepare my students for the English EOC SOL every year that I have been in VA. I like the layout, the explanations, and the practice tests. However the book was published in 2004 and some of the material is now outdated and useless. The SOL tests have been revised several times since then and I look forward to Barron's next publication on this subject."
1,Dangerous toy,My one year old got has finger caught in the trunk door and was severely bruised. This is a dangerous toy for small fingers.
5,"Excellent study of the elusive, illusional in life","This short novel is a gem -- large in scope if not in words. A script writer is dying of cancer. His double, a producer and second husband of the writer's ex-wife, offers him a project -- a gift to keep his mind on things other than dying. The book narrates the film script he is writing - a film on Greta Garbo centered on the event that turned her from another good actress to the film goddess. As he researches and writes the script, the writer comes to terms with his own elusive (illusive) love for a half-sister, to terms with living as a passive canvas versus living with self-understanding.The book is exquisite - well researched and perceptive of people and their idols, the effect of time on changing idols. If you read for action, this is probably not to your liking. If you read to expand your understanding of humanity, this belongs on your ""must read"" list."
3,"134 pages long, not 192!","I haven't read the book, but caveat emptor! The book is smallish and only 134 pages, not the 192 listed above. And while it's very beautifully designed and produced, the type is fairly spaced out so that you could read it easily in an hour and half. So, despite the cover designation ""A Novel"" it's really a novella."
1,Santa & Pete: A Novel of Christmas Present and Past,"I ordered this book when placing an order for Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff Christ's Childhood Pal by Christopher Moore. I ordered Santa and Pete thinking it was written by the same Christopher Moore who wrote Practical Demon Keeping, Blood Sucking Fiends, Coyote Blue, etc. I've never been so disappointed just opening a box - in fact, Santa and Pete is still in the box. Santa and Pete is written by a different Christopher Moore. I feel very mislead by ..... as this book was suggested along with all of the above mentioned books by Christopher Moore (I do own all of the previous books by Christopher and truly believed I was getting a Christmas story he was involved in writing). Bad marketing ..... - misleading and dishonest - really helped shake the confidence I had in you. You might like to research your authors more before pulling a stunt like this - doesn't do much for your good-will......."
5,The best new tradition since Rudolph!,"This book has touched me. Not since ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" have I been so moved. ""Santa & Pete"" is the perfect book for anyone raising children and also anyone wanting to get the Christmas spirit back. It teaches and inspires us to transcend race, cultural issues, religion, age and any other prejudice we may knowingly or unknowingly harbor. It teaches us to value our family and friends. It teaches giving and charity. And it does it all in the very very entertaining story format involving a grandfather and grandson. This book could be the start of a better world! It should be required reading. Thank you Christopher Moore and Pamela Johnson!"
4,A delightful work of FICTION.,"I read this book for what it was...a wonderful book of fiction, about mythical characters. But on another level, Santa and Pete is a story about family, giving, closeness....values anyone, black white or whatever, must treasure. I sincerely wish those who would blast the book for being ""historically inaccruate"" would recognize it for what it is -- a ""novel of Christmas Past and Present"" loosely based on historical events -- and get over their own insecurities/prejudices/attitudes."
3,AN OKAY CHRISTMAS TALE,"A VERY, VERY NICE CHRISTMAS TALE---CONCERNING A BUS-DRIVING GRANDFATHERAND HIS GRANDSON IN NEW YORK ((NEW AMSTERDAM)). A BIT DRAGGY AT TIMES--BUT--A NICE LITTLE ((VERY QUICK)) FAMILY READ."
4,A New Christmas Tradition,"Moore and Johnson have crafted a new holiday tradition in this little book. An extremely engaging tale, Santa & Pete enables the reader to see and feel the story. Christmas in New York is a magical time. This story, though, waves a wand over the island of Manhattan and sprinkles it with snowflakes of fairy dust. Santa & Pete should be required reading for historians, theologians, and, perhaps most of all, parents who read to their children."
4,Beautifully Written,"Every generation needs a Christmas tale to call its own. Moore has created just such a story in Santa & Pete. I'll not fall into the debate about historical accuracy. Instead, I'll just say that this book does not apologize for its ""feel good"" manner and certainly succeeds in warming the reader.After reading this little treasure, I bought two dozen copies for Christmas. For those Grinches who would sooner argue over the ""facts"" presented in the story, I'd ask that they read it again. Perhaps the message of love and hope for a world where people are at peace with others would shine through. It certainly did for me."
1,Even Colonel Parker Didn't Like It!,"...and when the Colonel doesn't like it, you know it's gotta be bad! Absolute trash from the most talented entertainer of the twentieth century! It doesn't even work as a spoof, because spoofs are funny, and this one isn't. If negative stars could be awarded, this would rank about a minus 10! No wonder Elvis said of Hollywood, ""I know this town's laughing at me."" He was right! After this turkey they were. Don't waste ninety minutes of your life watching this. Pop in King Creole if you want to get a glimpse of what Presley's film career could have been like if someone involved with these movies actually gave a damn."
1,Baaaaaaaaaaaaaad,Anyone who could sit through this turkey and then give it the highest rating of 5 stars has my sympathy. You really need to see a doctor.Elvis made a number of movies that weren't great. But this is the WORST.Absolutely nothing to recomend it as a film. Though the soundtrack is very good.
1,Why?,Why they chose this movie to put in a box set is beyond me. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and thinking it was dumb. Where is Girl Happy? They have put out practically every other movie of his but not this one. It should have been put out long before Harum Scarum. The plot was simply ridiculous and completely unbelievable even for an Elvis movie.
1,Hokum,"An unfunny, and flat, effort to style Elvis as a Valentino-Errol Flynn romantic hero, badly written and looking shoddy with sterile backlots filling in for Arabian-type scenery. Features only one worthwhile song, ""So Close Yet So Far"", while the best track, ""Animal Instinct"" was left out (although appearing as a 'bonus song' on the soundtrack album).After inane material such as this, John Lennon's quip that Elvis ""died in the Army"" is hauntingly accurate, in a figurative sense."
1,The Most Entertaining Mess...a Real Howler,"Words fail to describe how awful this film is...and yet, I have not enjoyed watching a movie this much in a long, long time. It is screamingly funny, albeit in mostly unintentional ways. The dialog is somewhere south of stupid; the sets look as fake and cheap as the backyard of ""The Brady Bunch""; the costumes seem to be from someone's attic; and the music is vapid and cheesier than a vat of Velveeta. There is one very creepy sequence where Elvis' character encourages an overly precocious young girl to dance ""seductively"" for him, and of course, racist stereotyping abounds throughout. Elvis gamely tries to make his character credible, but at times, I think he deserves an Oscar simply for not rolling his eyes. By all means, see this movie with someone you love, and be prepared to hoot like a tree full of owls. This one makes CLAMBAKE look like CITIZEN KANE."
3,"Not the best, but Elvis still saves the picture.","""Harum Scarum"" is considered, by popular opinion to be Elvis' worst film. Don't try to restrain yourself yet. Watch it once, and see what you think. Elvis is an actor who is sent to Arabia and captured. He is trying to be put into the situation to kill the Arabian king. Elvis romances Mary Ann Mobley and turns against his captors and saves the king. Lot of action. Looks like a big budget film, but it's not. Sam Katzman, who had a reputation in Hollywood for producing films on very short schedules and given the nickname ""king of the quickies"", borrowed most of the costumes and sets from previously made films that were in the can. The schedule was only 18 days of shooting. Sounds corny, cheap, and cheesy, but that's what pop stars had to deal with in films they didn't like. Pop stars got the poorest film treatment. Again it is not Elvis' best film, but try it. If you don't like it, forget it."
3,Elvis and Miss America in a world of Arabian Nights fantasy,"HARUM SCARUM is a colourful excursion into fantasy and music, as Elvis Presley plays an action film star, who gets lost in a world of Arabian Nights-esque intrigue. Former ""Miss America"" Mary Ann Mobley plays his seven-veiled princess.This is a fun romp, along the same lines as the ""Road To..."" movies, and Elvis completely throws himself into the proceedings. Mary Ann Mobley is a stunning love interest and the production values are quite lavish (this film was actually shot on the old sets used for Cecil B. DeMille's ""King of Kings"" in 1925). With Fran Jeffries, Michael Ansara, Billy Barty and Jay Novello."
5,whirlwind masterpieces,"""The Mr. Quin stories were not written as a series,"" explains Agatha Christie in her short foreword, and the mysterious character is, in her words, ""an epicure's taste"". But I found nothing demanding special taste in these (as we would say now) fast-paced stories, originally published in 1930. Twenty pages Christie gives herself each time, from setting the scene, to filling in the background, all the way to the denouement. And in spite of the formula -- the mysterious Quin serving as mentor and catalyst for the ever-curious Mr. Satterthwaite -- one does not tire. Each story is as exciting as the one before. No doubt that Agatha Christie was the master mystery writer."
4,High-brow,"The book is complicated to read for the average reader, with many characters in every short story and lots of names of people and places to remember. A few of the stories are scary, but most of them are just plain mysteries which have the reader waiting for the surprise - or shock - twist at the end of each. Some of the short stories's twists are based on physics - such as in The Face of Helen - while others are more like plays with a dramatic twist. This is a difficult book to visualize. If you read books by visualizing the plot and the characters as if you're making a movie, you will have a hard time reading this because this book is almost like an engineering textbook."
5,Great Product,This was a great idea.It saves outlet on my timer so I can use 8 items instead of 4.Well worth it
5,A Simple Invention That Is Quite Useful,"Simple but quite useful product.I have a UPS and a few powerstrips in the house. They are great by providing more outlets. But with all the power adapters that runs most of the gadgets today, even one of those power adapters can cover 2 to 3 outlets which defeats the purpose of having a powerstrip. The liberator solves that problem.Also, some power adapters can be huge and heavy that its weight alone tends to loosen it from the wall, the liberator serves as a little extension to prevent it from loosening up. Loose connections are dangerous, it can produce sparks that not only can ruin your equipments but can even starts a fire. Countertop receptacles can also be problematic where they are awkwardly situated sideways."
5,Usefl and Inexpensive,Strip Liberators are great. They free up slots on a surge strip as well as making sure bulky transformers don't get dislodged.I am a computer consultant and I use them for my clients. The prevent power problems by making sure transformers make good contact.Well worth the cost.
3,"Not 14"" as described, will not reach floor from US standard outlet","Even the package is labeled 12"" and that measurement is to the tip of the metal plug. Not a 14"" cable."
2,Kill-a-Watt power rated 15 amps but this cord is about 7 amps,"Kill-a-Watt Caution. I checked with the shipper and this cord has a lower power rating than the Kill-a-Watt you may be using it with. To avoid over-heating this cord be sure not to use with refrigerator, washer, dryer, air conditioner or other large power using appliance. Kill-a-Watt is rated 15 amps (1875 VA) and this cord is smaller, about 1/2 the amount of the Kill-a-Watt. We want you to be safe and avoid the classic ""extension cord fire"" from over-heating a cord."
1,Cheaped out Chinese Stuff - Misrepresented,"I bought these on the basis that I was getting 16AWG wire. Got them home, opened the box and they are 18AWG. Construction is fine, but they are not the wire that was represented. Sure, these are usually used to get a wall wart off a power strip, and likely youre not running a huge load through... but still. Copper is expensive but no reason for the MFR to misrepresent."
1,They don't send what they claim,"Like another reviewer said, they don't send what they claim: it's 18awg, not 16awg. You can get 18awg for cheaper elsewhere."
3,Really cool,"This product is really useful, but it would be nice if the cords were a little longer, as the plugs will still bulk the area up."
5,A Really Great Idea,These little guys are real lifesavers. The are essentially a very short extension cord that allows you to plug adapters into a power strip or outlet without covering empty sockets rendering them useless. I have ordered two packs so far and keep finding more and more situations where they come in handy.
3,"Would work, but not as advertised","Similar to others, I received extension cords that were not exactly as advertised. I received 18 AWG cords with no indication of manufacturer. 16 AWG is a larger wire and can therefore handle slightly greater current. This product will work for most typical applications, but I purchased it specifically to have the beefier wire. I bought from Amazon, not a third party vendor. I returned the item for a refund. I might try another vendor, but don't know if I might get the same thing. I have followed the recommendation of another reviewer and will try the ""Stanley 31372 One-Foot Cord Max Extender, 3-Pack"""
5,Just Right !!,"These extenders work great, not to long or short. Seem to be made well. I shopped every local store possible, but no luck. On-line was only way for me to get these things."
2,Misleading,"Just received. They are 10""-Inch Exension power strip liberators.....not 14"" as advertised. Irritated...don't like misleadings ads. Also, I had purchased these a few years back from a mail order catalog and was happy with them so I had not read the other reviews until now. The ones I bought from a mail order catalog were in fact 14"" long, 13 Amps not 18 amps like these and they are UL approved which these apparently are not. First time got burned when buying from Amazon directly and I buy fairly often.Ziotek ZT1212542 Power Strip Liberator 14-Inch Extension, 5-PackZiotek ZT1212542 Power Strip Liberator 14-Inch Extension, 5-Pack"
4,These work great,"What can you say about an electrical pigtail? You plug them in and they work. The price is not as low as I would like, but the cords are quality and they resolve the problems I have been having with power adapters taking up too much space to use both outlets at the same time. I would buy these again."
5,Good,These were heavy duty plugs that allowed me to address my (many) AC to DC transformer issues (as seen in product picture). Good product. :)
5,Handy and well made. Free your outlets!,"One of the continuing trends in electronics is big and bulky power chargers. The worst offenders are those that block several outlets or make even power strips unusuable.As I have several electronic items that need to be charged in the office and limited outlets even with a power strip, these were a great solution.1) Perfect length to move those bulky power charger from the outlet and create SPACE.2) There are three prongs so the item is grounded just as if you plugged it directly into the power outlet.3) The pack comes with 5 of these and once you use one, you'll find it's great to have more. I've quickly used all 5.I have had no issues with these power extension cords and thing it's worked well to cleanly help all the power strips and power outlets in my house use all their outlets."
3,100% Price Increase Since 2010,I bought two sets of these in 2010 for $10.90 per pack including free shipping. Now it's time to buy more and the price has doubled. Zero stars for the price increase but five stars for the product.
1,Don't buy for charging station valets,"Power Strip Liberator Ext, 5 PackHas no use with charging station valets. Why does Amazon suggest buying together??"
2,Couldn't return,"I suppose, these would have been fine, but it turned out I didn't need them. When I tried to return them, I found out I couldn't. Guess I'll give them away."
5,"As usual, Lina and co. must fight evil and goofy foes.","To sum up this volume: Lina, Gourry, Zelgadis and everyone have found magician Rezo's secret labrotory, where his legacy is hidden. Lina, as usual, hopes it's a ton of gold, swords, and in general treasure. Zelgadis wants to return his body to normal. And Gourry... wants to eat something. Amelia and Silphio tag along too, as everyone races for the legacy, while fighting with the DEVIL CHICKEN (?!) and have their final battle with Eris.Excellent Video."
5,So good,"I was reading a magazine and in its top 10 books section, was amazing grace. I thought ""Hmm this sounds good."" So i preceeded to check it out from the local library. I am a total book FrEAk, so I thought about giving it a try. This book is PHENOMENAL!( am i spelling that right?) You have to read it! I do though recomend it for ages 12+. Even though I am only 11. I was really good. If you are a teen girl and like to read even in the least, you will LOVE this book. I am probably going to buy it, for a part of my permanent collection, it was just that good! ~Love ya, J6E1K3"
5,yeeah!,i liked this book alot!!!!!!!!!!!! it rocks my world!!! i liked it because Megan did a really good job making it reallistic and fun at the same time. She developed the characters and stuck with their personalities the whole way through the book. Go Megan Shull!!!!!!!!! yeah yeah yeah!!!
2,Not so harmless,Cute? Parts are. Harmless teen read? Not really. Grace is 15 years old and spending the night with her boyfriend in his cabin while her aunt enjoys a fling with the bodyguard.
3,"A cute, short story","I admit I was drawn into reading this book by the style of the writing and my own love for tennis. The story was pretty good, but the ending seemed a bit rushed. It's a good book for a quick read."
5,"Essential reading for Pinball Collectors, a MUST have!","Well, I finally went ahead and took the plunge and got all 3 of the Pinball Compendium book. Sure, they're not exactly cheap, but I found the best price on them anywhere on Amazon. I have to tell you, these books are ESSENTIAL reading and must haves for anyone who collects pinball machines, or just interested in their history, and a pretty complete synopsis of all the major games put out by each of the major manufacturers, from the 30's all the way to just a few years ago. The books are very well laid out, packed with TONS of history of both the games evolution and of the manufacturers, interviews with the designers and artists, and TONS of pictures. Get the books for the pics if nothing else! Do yourself a favor and pick these up, you won't be disappointed! These are pretty much an Encyclopedia for pinball machines and collectors. Well worth the money, Highly recommended!Jeff ScottOrlando, FL"
4,husband loved the hat,I got this hat for my husband for Christmas. He likes it very much but it was a little too tight. We are hoping to stretch it out by wearing it. i expect he will wear it for a long time. The leather is a nice color and texture too.
3,Inconsistent quality,"I actually bought two of these. I ordered the wrong size the first time, so I just gave it to my girlfriend rather than send it back. After I purchased a second one for myself, I noticed a major difference in the two hats. The first was rigid, and not what I would call ""crushable,"" but I assumed that maybe it needed a little breaking-in. The second hat was thinner, and lighter despite the larger size. After wearing it for about a year, it got permanently reshaped and now looks like a costume hat."
2,Disappointing,"Not very good--the frames look ok, which is why I got them but actually you have to cut down your pictures a little, even if the size is the same as the frame, because of the border. Also not very magnetic, many were constantly falling off my fridge, some never even stuck to the fridge, and none could hold anything up but themselves. I would go for some sturdier ones that had a stronger magnet even if they don't look as nice."
2,"Flimsy, odd sizes, poor product.","Lets see...the frames are flimsy... REALLY flimsy and bend out of shape easily.There is no glass for the frames.. it's just a clear piece of plastic that scratches up nice and quickthe frames have an open side - bottom/top depends on how you turn it, but they aren't even sealed up in there - just slid into placethe sizes of most of the frames are odd, the wallet sizes were good - and I wish it had consisted only of wallet sized frames - then it would be a good buy to hand out for xmas pictures.the magnets weren't bad - they are holding well enough. I would NOT let a child play with these.. they'd end up destroyed in very short order.Don't buy if you expect them to last any length of time."
2,maybe good for coloring book pictures?,Super flimsy and bend quite easily making them constantly fall off the fridge and they have no protective covering so you don't want to put photos you really care for in them for fear they will get ruined.The edges can be kind or rough/sharp so not recommended for small children to play with.They may work great for kids who love to color and put up there own art work but thats about it.The look great in the picture but the quality is terrible.
5,They're great!,I gave these to our daughter and son-in-law for Christmas. With two small children their refrigerator is covered with loose pictures. This set is perfect for protecting the pictures and keeping them from falling off.
3,wouldnt buy again,"i am not a huge fan of this product. they are flimsy, kinda bulky and the pictures need to be cut down to fit. not ideal for what i wanted them for. Also the smallest size is pointless in my opinion.i would not buy this again."
4,Good deal for the price!,These frames have dressed up our refrigerator 'collages.' They are very light-weight and the variety of sizes are nice. This was a great deal for the price.
4,A good start...,"I like the For Dummies books. They give one a good start or an overview of the subject matter. To date, I've not finished reading this book. But have read enough to realize it is a good book to get one started."
5,Joshua and the Flow of Biblical History,"Francis A. Schaeffer has done a great job of presenting a wonderfully accurate commentary on the book of Joshua...It was one of the best that I have ever read. He follows the text and presents good, sound interpretations. You will find it a good companion to your study of this old and yet so revealing book of Joshua.Enjoy, C. Hopler from North Carolina :)"
3,lacks spark,Dr. Schaeffer's work is comprehensive and covers the territory..but his style is very dull and lacks the inspiration of some of his other works. Not recommending.
3,"Questionable ""respect""","I've read many,many books about the Amish (particularly the Old Order Amish) and, though I haven't read this one, I question the author's claim to have written about them ""with respect"", because his book is said to have many photos, and the Amish really do not like to have their picture taken AT ALL. They would never pose for one, and usually drop their heads as quickly as possible when they realize a camera is pointed at them. Just an observation! Do the other orders welcome photos being taken of them?"
2,Not indicative of his style at all,"After listening to his 2nd and 3rd albums, I decided to pick this up. Boy was that a mistake. Instead of the lush ballads and beautiful lyrics, all this CD has is generic dance R&B. It's obvious that the label, not JOE, were the ones calling the shots on this one. The only tolerable song is ""I'm In Luv"" and even that gets played out after a while. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one."
1,Horrible Debut from Promising Singer,JOE is a very capable singer but he released a horrible debut in the form of Everything. The only song worth mentioning is I'm In Luv otherwise AVOID AT ALL COSTS !
5,The Black Hussars,This is one of the best books I have ever read. Great history about cops and immigrants.
3,comment to a previous reviewer,"A previous reviewer (annalait@apia.vlk.fi) commented that Miss Julie is a true story about Strindberg, his 16 yr. old lover and his wife Harriet. This is not entirely correct. It is based on one of his marriages - to his first wife Siri von Essen. He married Siri in 1877. Miss Julie was written in 1888 and was first put on stage in 1889 with Siri acting out the role of Julie. He divorced Siri in 1891 and did not meet Harriet (who was actually his third wife) until 1900. They married in 1901. Strindberg identifies with Jean in the play. Strindberg felt inferior to Siri (a Baroness). Jean was also inferior to Julie but he triumphed over her in the end."
4,Realistic romance,"The first time read this play was in summer school when I had to play a part of Julies role. After I got home read the whole play and in school I got the chance to participate a cource that followed the paractices of Miss Julie. August Strindberg was a weird or very unlucky man. Whole his life he looked for the woman of his life and everytime ended up with strong women that he end up hating. Strindberg was also a woman hater in allmost every meaning of the word. I think that he had fun while playing whith Julies life. The play is based on a true story. Jean is Strindberg, Julie is his 16 yrs old lover from his summer place and Kristen is Strindbergs wife Harriet. I like the play, but I can't help that Strindbergs life and ideas offected me very much. This play made me sick and charmed."
2,Classism and sexism combined,"How can this be a great ""modern"" playwright whenthe views and themes of this major play have a better partfor the 17th century than the 20th?I thought about it and if it was produced in San Franciscoeven with it's respect for the arts, on meritsthe play would be jeered.Woody Allen thought that Strindberg hated women,but I think he just lacked any understanding of them."
3,Slightly different opinon,"I disagree slightly with the previous reviewer's opinon. The book is inferior in comparison to ""Needful Things"", but it is certainly better than ""Tommyknockers."""
3,Now Knock-Off Is Available Everywhere,"I have used Kanon by Scannon for 20 years...until the last few years, the imported aftershave was available on the web and at discount cosmetic stores. Now, the only product available is a knock-off imported from Masson of Canada that does NOT incorporate Patchuli in its ingredients list...it does have the cod liver oil and its vitamins, but not that exquisite fragrance that lent Kanon such a spicy, luxiurious scent. I miss the real Kanon imported from Scandinavia. This is not Kanon by Scannon, it's Kanon by Masson of Canada under license from Scannon, and it is not the real thing. If anyone knows how to find the Scandinavian version in the US, please lt me know! I guess at $20 it's an ok value, but not like the original."
1,bad product,"so sorry that I purchased this after shave from this supplier. it is not the real thing. different color, different scent and the label didn't even fit the bottle. In the past I purchased the after shave from a supplier that I have dealt with for years, only chose this supplier as I had an amazon gift card to use. Now I have wasted my gift card and gotten something that I will have to throw away. Won't purchase anything from this supplier again. only giving it one star because I can't give it a minus"
4,Kanon After Shave,"Good service, prompt shipment, good price. Product was hard to find in stores, this was an excellent way to get it."
1,Poor quality toilet seat,This seat has been in use for about 2 months and yesterday both pieces connecting the cover to the hinge broke in the middle. I'm not aware that anyone abused the seat.
2,The Table Where Rich People Sit,"Not as good as I had wanted. Very length pages. I lost several of my students attention when reading it. The idea is good, but a little too abstract for small children to understand. It required a lot of discussion and several students still didn't understand the message."
5,Love this book!,"This book brings tears to my eyes. It reminds me of the benefits of living surrounded by nature and does it in a fun way (through a child's eyes while she's learning the monetary ""value"" of her life from her parents). I gave this as a gift to several close friends because the message is truly beautiful."
1,Wrong DVD,I too ordered this DVD to get a cardio workout with the resistance band and got a DVD for ball exercises. The DVD was labeled correctly and even included a band. I returned it for a refund.
4,A Useful Research Tool,"This is both a useful research tool and an ejoyable read, especially for those interested in the Port Royal Experiment. The diaries and letters may be incomplete, however, since I have seen excerpts in other books that do not appear here."
5,Flambeau Maximizer Tackle Chest,"Great box. Big enough to hold all my muskie lures. Great price, too! and very quick shipment. I'd buy this one again!"
4,exactly what he wanted,"I bought this muskie lure tackle box for my husband's birthday. It arrived in just days, in perfect condition. It was heavier than I expected, but he was thrilled. The compartments keep all the lure seperate, so we no longer have to sort through a mess of lures/hooks at the bottom of his tackle box. Only problem is, he has too many empty sections so we need to buy more lures!Great product."
2,Left nothing but fog in my brain and a hole in my wallet,"I'm a great fan of apocolyptic and futuristic drama -- everything from 1984, to Twilight Zone, to Mad Max -- and I know when the message is profound and communicated effectively, and when it's not. In this instance, a couple of special effects scenes that convince the world the second messiah has come, combined with a bit of dialogue about mankind's need to clean up our act lest the end come, adds up to nothing memorable except frustration and disappointed expectations. Those behind this item may have had something to say, but it got lost along the way and left only a highly idiosyncratic story line and dialogue which is likely better understood by the writer than by anyone else. I know many different kinds of critical thinking people, but can think of few of them who wouldn't be well advised to avoid this one."
4,Good movie,"Christopher Eccleston is always a pleasure to watch and Lesley Sharp is fantastic in this. (Another person I always like even if the work around her isn't the greatest.) Interesting premise. I'd have liked the storyline of Ace to be more fleshed out; but, still, I enjoyed it."
2,sadly disappointed,"I absolutely loved the other Margaret George novels; this however is sadly disappointing. I agree with the reviewer who said is is uninspired. It reads like a young adult Sunday School lesson. Mary's dialogue is so unbelievable; the setting is so ""clean"" and brings to mind 1950's Hollywood Bible stories. I forced myself to read over half way through thinking it would get better, but it doesn't. Margaret - you can do much better!"
2,300 pages too long,"I started this book because it was selected for our book club and that is why I finished it. The most exciting part was when Jesus went to Jeruselum. The rest was fairly tedious. Our group really had a problem with the Mary Mother of Jesus character. She was visited by an angel before Jesus' birth, people worshiped her baby after his birth - yet she is surprised and doesn't initially believe in Jesus' mission! This book could have told the same story and have been a much more interesting read in 300 pages instead of 600."
1,Not Her Best,"I love Margaret George books. Having said that, ""Mary Called Magdalene"" was the most disappointing of the lot. Give me Henry, with his robust character and Will his Fool. Give me Mary Queen of Scotts...was there ever a more ill-fated woman. But spare me this Mary of Magdalene. I couldn't relate to her on any level....not biblical, not emotionally, not even as a ""good read"". A total disappointment."
5,Entertaining and Informative,"As one who is typically skeptical of fiction based on biblical characters, I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of research and insight Margaret George provides in this story of Mary Magdalene. I thought her portrayal of demon possession was especially compelling. I was also impressed with her ability to include Jesus in the dialogue and make it believable instead of stilted and forced. I found the book to be enjoyable and inspiring and highly recommend it."
1,Henry beats Mary Again!,"Trained by the wonderful Autobiography of Henry VIII, I expected a lively attack or an imaginative twist in MG's treatment of the mysterious saint. But Mary Magdalen may have scared MG, because the saint was treated with a pious coldness and drifty sentimentality that tries not to offend anybody, but ends up likely offending Mary Magdalen herself."
2,just plain boring,"I almost never give up on a book, but after forcing myself onward for about 200 pages, I finally quit on this one. I like historical fiction, and I'm familiar with the Bible, and with the history of the period, so that's not the problem--or, rather, that is the problem, because I was looking for something new, interesting, creative, surprising, and compelling. Instead, this book is just plain boring. The characters, dialogue, and plotting are too often flat (which is to say, either predictable or unpersuasive). Put in the fancier terminology of literary theorists, there is a total lack of ""de-familiarization,"" i.e., taking something familiar (e.g., the biblical story, and biblical history), and somehow treating it in a new, different way (as via metaphor or allegory) to give the reader a new experience, and a new level of insight. If you want a good literary treatment of a pivotal biblical figure, read Frederick Buechner's The Son of Laughter (about Jacob)."
1,"DULL, FLAT, BORING SORRY MARGRET G.","I loved Cleopatra and 3 other books I read of George's...but this one I had to put down even though I read 2/3's of it. If one is going to make up what these ""characters"" were to have said...one could do immensely better than George did here. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
4,"Mary, by Margaret George","Margaret George is a fantastic writer, so even though I am not all the way through this book, I'm sure it will be excellent. The quality of the book was fine."
3,Respecful and informative but a little lacking,"Generally I did enjoy reading the book, and I liked the respectful way in which Mary is portraited along with the historical setting. I think George did an excellent job creating a life for Mary and exposing Jesus life and mesage. I was expecting a more extense exploration of Mary's feelings for Jesus and a hint that maybe he could have shared those feelings. I think the book is definitevely worth reading but I agree with some of the other reviews that it is not George's best work. I enjoyed Mary, Queen of Scotts a great deal more."
1,Falls way short,"Since I loved George's other books, I made the false assumption that this one would be as interesting and well written. No such luck. The dialogue was stilted and boring. None of the characters were likeable. I would not have followed anyone of them based on the what George has written. As egalitarian as Jesus supposedly was, this character of the Magalene would have never existed in that time and place. Projecting modern values left this book practically void of history.Of course, this ""story"" is based for the most part on faith rather than historical fact unlike George's other books and apparently George's faith interpretation is uniquely her own. She might as well have called it Mary Magdalene the Superhero. Totally unbelieveable and void of feeling. Don't bother."
2,woefully western,"The author takes he words of Jesus, some of the historic facts of scripture and totally misapplies them in this novel. She completely misses the cultural context of the first century, but rather imports what she has read into a very western, rather twenty-first century mindset. She completely ignores the honor-shame implications of the first century, totally misappropriates the role of a woman in those days into what she might imagine it being, and does very little to advance the plot of her novel beyond her living room. We never are brought to an understanding of Jesus within the world in which he lived nor an appreciation of the eastern, non-linear, mindset. She does use some easily known facts regarding the 1st c. Judaism, but never explores or applies these to her novel.I was terribly disappointed in the verbosity, the lack of realism, and the cultural inadequacy of this novel. I would never recommend it."
3,"Dull, plodding...","I learned a lot about dried fish, ritual washing and exocism. Sigh.I have loved all of Margaret George's previous novels, my personal favorite is the Autobiography of Henry VIII. This book is so earnest. It wants the characters to be human, but refuses to take the risks. Instead of passion, the apostles are reduced to juvenille bickering. All the disciples are jealous whiners. How much time can be spent by Mary wondering if Jesus likes the other formerly possessed chick better than her?Maybe I was expecting something more shocking, less pious...Maybe I was expecting something better.I borrowed this one from the library. Glad I resisted the temptation to buy it."
1,I'd rather do laundry than read this book,"I made it 3/4 of the way through this book before I realized I would rather be mopping floors or doing laundry rather than continue reading it. I kept feeling obligated to slog through it after spending the money to buy it. I finally threw it away and felt immediately better! Dry, dry, dry, too bad, I am actually a fan and enjoyed all George's other books."
2,Ehh....not impressed.,"This was my first time reading a book by Margaret George. I found the writing to be on roughly a seventh or eight grade level. What I'm looking for in a book like this is to be transported back in time, and it didn't even come close.I would not recommend this book."
1,A big disappointment--boring and corny,"I liked Margaret George's other books for the way they made history come alive. This time, though, she gets all bogged down in clichés. As the New York Times pointed out, ""It's not easy to write a love scene for Jesus."" I wish Ms. George hadn't tried; she seems totally earnest, but the book is embarrassingly trite and obvious, like a bad old movie. Please go back to history, ma'am--just give us the facts."
3,Not George's Usual,"I must add my disappointment to the list of others. If you have read any of Margaret George's other books, this one isn't much to rave about. The story seemed to be a very long journey for both the characters and the reader. Her other books are nearly double the length, yet the pages flew past. While reading this one, I was a ""page number watcher"" starting midway through the book. I anxiously await her next book...I read somewhere (possibly on the author's web page?) that the character explored next will be Joan of Arc and is due out in 2005***** UPDATE ***** Helen of Troy is the next Margaret George book, due out in 2006."
2,Very boring,I found this book very dull. It has taken me two weeks to read this book (I have a tendency to skim also and it still took two weeks) and I am still not finished and I dont think I will finish it to be honest. I can read a book in a day or two if I am kept interested.
1,"A disappointing ""Mary Magdalene Superstar""","I was a big fan of Margaret George's other books, but they were about truly central figures in history like Henry the Eighth and Cleopatra. By choosing to write about the relatively obscure Mary of Magdala, Ms. George paints herself into a corner--she has to make her subject seem more important than it really is. So Mary, implausibly, becomes the center of every single important event, while -- most regrettably -- Our Lord Jesus Christ fades into the background as little more than a cheesy faith healer who changes Mary's life. This book is a sad disservice to the devout as well as to students of history."
1,A Big Yawn,I am very grateful for all the reviews of this book which I have read. I struggled with this book and have to admit I couldn't finish it. I was expecting a really good read but what I found was that it was a very effective sleeping pill. Your other reviewers have saved me from thinking I HAD to finish it.
2,Blah,"It starts off boring and it's really hard to get into. It is really long and since it wasn't the most interesting book ever, it took me a while to read it. After reading it I'm glad I have a the info, but I feel like I could have read a book 1/4 of the size and got the same thing out of it."
3,Unsure...,"I bought this book hoping that it would be a good read for Lent. Being Catholic, I hoped it would stay true to the gospels while offering other insights into the life of Mary. It was a nice story on the whole. I mean, I wasn't bored to tears or anything. I just couldn't swallow some of the parts that contradicted what I was brought up to believe, mainly: that Jesus had siblings (I personally believe that he was an only child), 2) that Jesus and Mary Magdalene met when they were children, 3) Mary (Jesus' mother) was initially against Jesus' ministry, and 4) Mary was never a prostitute. I know Margaret was fusing the written tradition with historical evidence, and I respect that, but I'm still a little biased against those parts of the story."
5,Cured a wound,This product is great to cure a wound that does not respond to OTC ointments. I had a bed sore that did not respond to OTC ointments and a nurse in charge of wound care at a local hospital told me to get SAF-Gel. Started to work immediately.
3,great bedtime reading - you won't want to put it down,"""Jane Harvard"" definitely brings to life the convolution of an average college campus. It's hard to keep up with who is sleeping with whom and whether they get paid for it! This thriller may lead those who weren't getting any action at college to wish they'd gone to Harvard. In the meantime, there's actually a plot of sorts and the woman journalist protagonist is both interesting and a little too curious for her own good. You have to wonder if she ever studies! None of the characters is really developed all that well, and for some you have a lot of difficulty figuring out WHY they are in positions of authority at a leading university...but it still keeps your attention. It's a fast ride all the way thru and it does keep you up reading past your bedtime. The seamy side of life is revelled in - so sit back and enjoy the ride."
4,A fun read for Harvard grads,"I couldn't put this book down. While it ain't great literature, it IS a ton of fun as a Harvard alum to look for and chuckle at the book's detail of the campus and its surroundings. References to Store 24 made me remember those nights as a freshman that we scraped together change to run over and get a box of Entenman's cookies! I was skeptical as to whether a novel written by four people would at all be readable. It definitely is."
5,Fun! Contemporary and wild!,"""The Student Body"" is a MUST read!! It's fun and an easy reading book.The story is quite contemporary and you will find yourself flying through the pages as you try to figure out what is going to happen next. The characters are completely delicious and fierce!! You'll love them."
5,Original and Exciting -- but not for the irony-impaired,"Jane Harvard's collaborative book differs from most of what's on the market in that it's a thriller with a sense of humor, and its characters are not limited to white men. It succeeds both as a page-turner and as an ironic commentary on ""multicultural""issues. Obviously, not everyone is into this, but then again, not everyone is into books that require intelligence. I loved it, and got my friends to read it."
5,Fast paced thrills,"I thought The Student Body was an exciting and very entertaining read. The almost sarcastic humor was great comic relief for a fast paced thriller plot that sounded more like an episode of Hard Copy than a novel about the Ivy League.I really liked the strong characterization of Toni and her friend, young women who won't take no for an answer. Toni is a great character."
5,One more makes three,"WE just recently added another XTi 4000 to our system. We drive our subs with them. We have two already and added a third. The Amazon price was very, very good. I would recommend this amp since I have not had any problem with my other two and I would certainly recommend Amazon's price and their service (delivery) was prompt."
5,The best,I have all kind of amps but this one run with the best. Lite wight pull less power put out more power. I am running on dub18 u can't stand to close it shake your body. The computer hook up is my favorite.it give u full control. I changed all my amp tuning three 2000 xti highs n one 4000xti subs. I am still running on QSC it's cool would. Like another crown put can't spend for it right now I use my mix to control the QSC 5star. Did I mention I dropped it off the bar on the cement floor it's banged up but still working fine (crown).
1,"Thought it was an incredible amp, at first","Thought going with crown would be a great investment for our PA system. We ran this setup for about a year and after 6 blown subs started thinking something may be wrong with the amps. After talking to crown and them assuring us that we were doing everything right we brought the amps in for service and the tech said he couldn't find a problem with them, but didn't seem to know abut the phase inversion of these amps. Be sure to do your homework before buying. Crown's quality has fallen. Anyone want to buy 2 slightly used one's with a crown warranty service certification email me. Looking to make a deal to go back to the qsc rmx2450's after spending 1200 on reconing 18in subs."
4,VERY GOOD,ALL SAINTS ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE SPICE GIRLS. THEY HAVE A VERY ORIGINAL STYLE OF MUSIC. I HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE THE BEST GIRLBAND AROUND
5,One of the MOST useful guides to SPPS and statistical procedures,This book has been a life-saver. Its clear and concise about most of the main techniques you might need for analyzing your data. Its written as a practical guide to help you understand which statistical procedure to use. I'm a PhD student in Epidemiology and this is the book that really helped clear my concepts about the various statistical techniques and most importantly how and when to use them. All the classes I took in advanced mathematical statistics were full of jargon and theoretical stuff. This book is what helped me really understand the various techniques. Consider it a like a Dummies Guide to Practical Statistics..... I hope the author writes another book called SPSS for Advanced Statistics.
4,How could I download the data of CD ?,To customers who procured Kindle version of this book. How could we download the compact disk (CD) packaged with the hard-copy book?
3,"Great idea, amazing voice, but cheap production","It was great to hear Neil Sedaka live with a Klezmer band -- so I immediately bought this collection. Unfortunately, while Neil's voice is still amazingly young-sounding, the orchestrations and production values are so cheap! Mostly it's just Neil on piano, with a drummer, bassist and an occasional clarinetist. These songs are rich in cultural feeling, and that ""feeling"" requires a much larger wind section.I realize Neil no longer has a record label behind him, but this album sounds so thin! Plus, he throws in two decidedly non-Yiddish songs with ""Theme from Exodus"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" -- both written in the 1960s, years after the rest of the traditional songs on this album. Still, it's a pleasure (a machiah!) to hear the traditional stuff song brilliantly, with the lyrics enunciated and pronounced perfectly.Skip the 1960s English-language stuff and you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane."
4,He sings them straight,"It's good of Neil Sedaka to celebrate his roots. Talented as he is, I'd thought that perhaps he would choose to provide a fresh take on these songs, but he sings them just as they're normally heard, in competent albeit modest arrangements. Not all the songs are actually in Yiddish, but they're all associated with Jewish nostalgia."
5,old memories,"Reminded me when I was a young girl, listening to old yiddish albums at my grandparents!"
2,Not so Fantastic.,"Rhonda is a terrible villain. The entire Think Tank arc was boring, and the art was bland at best. The best part was Mark Millar's annual that introduces the Ultimate Inhumans. This book is very thin, only holding 2 issues and an annual that's only slightly longer then an issue. Sadly you have to read this to have completely read UFF, but at least it's a short nightmare."
2,pretty bad...,"i love the ultimate fantastic four, i think it's the best ultimate book out there (ok tied with ultimate spider-man). the vols. 1-3, and 5-6 are great. but this one sucks. you really don't need to read it at all, i think maybe they were in between writers/artists at the time and just got someone to fill in on issues 19-20. the annual isn't that great either, it just introduces the inhumans (basically johnny meets crystal)."
2,Lackluster,"I'm a huge fan of the Ultimate lines of X-Men, Spiderman, Ultimate(Avengers), and of course the Fantastic Four. For that reason, I am deeply upset with how UFF Vol. 4: Inhuman turned out. First off, this cover is way too decieving. Jae Lee, while an obviously talented artist, is definitely not the write person to be drawing for the Ultimate series. It completely veered away from the amazing artwork done in the first 3 volumes, which is pretty much the uniform look for the entire Ultimate universe.The stories definitely could have been better written and needed to be spanned out more. 2 issues is definitely not enough to fully tell the story with the Thinker. Then you have that UFF Annuals #1 which was even worse than the Thinker story. TOO SHORT, plus the artwork was just wrong. It was all a rare miss in the Ultimate line and having seen the upcoming Vol. 5: Crossover, it doesn't appear to be one that's going to be repeated."
5,As Good as All The Rest!,"The book took a while to get here, but they were in good shape. Anne George's Southern Sister's Mysteries are lighthearted and fun. I love Mary Alice and Patricia Anne, they keep me laughing!"
3,Not the best but still fun!,"There's no bull about it, Southern Sisters Mary Alice and Patricia Anne are back to entertain us! In Murder Shoots the Bull, Patricia Anne's neighbor finds himself accused of murder and the sisters know that he's innocent so they decide to intervene. The plot kind of meanders and there are several subplots going on at the same time. The redeeming factor is of course the Sisters and the laughter they inspire in just about any situation. Although this is my least favorite so far, I plan on reading the next one!"
5,Murder Shoots The Bull,These books by Anne George are so funny....they are Southern and such light hearted reading. I have sisters and have been to Birmingham several times so I love the characters and Steel Magnolia southern women.I had already read all of her books but bought these to replace the ones I had loaned out and had never come back to me. When they came I read them all over again....love it!
5,Sisters in Wonderland,"Like stepping through a rabbit hole, this sassy series of southern sisters is simply inspired fun, through and through. The character development and unusual situations make this book light hearted and fun. Improbable? Certainly. Entertaining? You bet! Anne George comes up with some fantastic names for her characters, and etches family and marital dynamics that really aren't too far fetched. The reader will also learn some Birmingham trivia (mostly about the Vulcan), where to buy fried chicken (the Piggly Wiggly) as well as the universal sign for a possum. Share this one with friends or even your sister!"
3,Series Getting Tired?,"The first four books in this series were very entertaining, fresh, and full of fun! However, in this one, Anne George loses that magic. One of the problems is the many sub-plots that only drag the book down: Her son and daughter-in-law's marital problems; her dog getting bit by a possum; the investment club plot that doesn't really go anywhere. Also, in this one, the sisters aren't really involved enough to be in any danger. They merely provide the supporting encouragement to the accused, who you know didn't do it. The revelation of the culprit is hasty, and ill-defined. She's also wearing some of her inside jokes pretty thin. I'm kind of tired of hearing about Vulcan's butt in every chapter. Ms. George continues to have some funny dialogue with her sisters, but overall, this book is tedious, and easy to put down. Hopefully, the next one ""Murder Carries a Torch"" will resurrect the magic."
2,VERY LITTLE HUMOR HERE---,"As my wonderful grandmother aged, her conversations became more and more negative and harder to sit through...that's how I felt about this book. Anne George was high on the negative factor. Adultery, separation, annulment, drugs, deceptions, deaths, attempted deaths, property destruction, blackmail, sibling hate, sick animals and roach infestation just to name a few. A little goes a long way and this story was on overkill. There was also very little of Mary Alice (the ""fun"" sister) to lighten the mood. Too many subplots that went nowhere and a forced ending didn't help."
1,Stay Away!,"I just got this. First screen that comes up notifies you that, due to licensing problems, you can't download the version on your CD anymore--you have to download a newer version from a web site. Lord knows why they're selling something you can't use--especially since they know you can't use it, given the banner that pops up telling you so!I downloaded the newer version--but it doesn't work well. I get loads of runtime errors and the program shuts down. For example, I can't open an existing PDF--the program crashes. Neither can I go to the ""secure"" part of the menu without a crash.Pretty pathetic and extremely disappointing. Don't buy it."
4,Very good for Hemingway fans,"Great reading for fans of Papa Hemingway, written with obvious admiration and respect. May be not appeal to the uninformed or casual Hemingway reader. Hard to find now, so grab a copy while you can if you're at all interested."
5,Well done!,"A friend told me about this author so I bought the book the other day. I couldn't put it down! I plan to purchase 20+ and give one to each member of my family. There is no judgement in this book, only open minded paths to peace. I highly recommend it!"
4,Change the way you Think and enrich your Life,"This is a collection of awsome quotes, thoughts, and short stories about all things that make up or effect your attitude. I refer back to these quotes often and use them in my life to communicate philosophies that enrich not only my life, and my families life, but in my business network. This is a must read for everyone. I especially liked, ""The Good News Girl Story."" I have shared that story with all of my business associates and friends.Thank you Mac for giving us this book!RJ Stratton"
4,Still going strong with a few leaks,"We purchased this a year ago, and as of yet, I haven't had to replace it. I really like the shower feature because it does a great job without dousing the plants completely. It has a few leaks now but I tightened it to the hose, and it seems fine. I also use it with Gardena attachments, and that seems to help a lot with leaks.I also like that you don't need a lot of pressure to keep this going unlike others I own."
1,Bad product,"I like Rubbermaid's product, but after purchased this spray nozzle. I willnever buy rubbermaid's spray nozzle AGAIN. First the water wouldn't come outfrom one of the pattern, it just leaked out from the side of the rubber ringthen the on/off switch broke off. It didn't last one season. Complete wasteof money. Maybe I got a lemon...."
4,GREAT sprayer,We just love this sprayer !!! it is durable and has so many great spray settings. My children had a blast playing in the hose with it.
4,Great sample of unique Jeni brand humor,This DVD is very funny although it's missing my favorite Jeni sketch (Imaginary Friend). I will miss his unique view of our world.
2,Not funny,"I heard Richard Jeni on XM Radio some time ago, and thought he was extremely funny. I ordered this DVD and expected to hear some of the same material on it. But I was disappointed, this DVD was mildly funny, don't waste your money on this DVD."
5,Laughed so hard that I cried!,"I loved Richard Jeni's performances. Having lost my mother to suicide, his death saddened me deeply. Prayers to those who were closest to him and loved him the most. His talent will be remembered forever."
5,Hilarious!,"Absolutely loved it! We have watched it about 20 times and we still laugh like crazy! We love Richard and we wish he was still here to make us laugh! RIP, my friend!"
