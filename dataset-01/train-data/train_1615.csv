4,Great value,"not much to say, includes everything you need to make a TON of wires / wire a house / whatever. why pay 8bucks for a 10foot pre-wired cable when you can make them yourself...assuming you need more then a few. Either way..cheap, good value. Crimper was a bit finicky at times....gotta put some muscle into it so to speak. tester = invaluable...no one plans on making mistakes but I sure did anyway."
5,Excellent value and easy to use!,Excellent Value and easy to Use! Comes with everything you need. The tester is a great added value.
4,"A Little Brief, But Good.","I will just focus on my favorite ones. ""Feel So Good,"" is melodious & smooth, while ""Fun & Games,"" has CM 's flugelhorn giving the tune a rhythmic bounce, & the Sax solo in the second part sustains the louder notes. ""Children Of Sanchez,"" may be CM's best known tune? Here background instruments add a soft background while the brass section starts everything off. Both compliment CM's flugelhorn to perfection. ""The Land Of Make Believe,"" goes at a slow pace with the rhythm section pulling everything together with the background orchestra. The loud to soft subtlties gave this one added zing. All in all a very enjoyable compilation."
2,"okay for a sample, but not complete for the fan","I agree with the fan from Virginia. This album is a disappointment for the Mangione fan who thinks he/she is getting the full tracks of the songs listed. Obviously, the second reviewer has never listened to the full tracks before offering the comments that this album is ""perfect"". Although the collection is a good synopsis of some of Mangione's better works, save your money for the real cuts, not the abbreviated versions here."
1,Go for the whole thing.,"If you really like Mangione then get the full length CD. Eleven bucks is too much, if you should pay any at all, to listen to only part of the tracks. Skip the preview and go buy Feels So Good or Children of Sanchez, at least you'll get the whole song and get your money's worth."
3,Skip the excerpts -- go for the real thing,"When I bought this CD, I did not look at the times on the tracks. In a few cases -- most noticeable ""Feels So Good"" -- the producers have excerpted the themes, cutting what was once a nine-minute track down to 3:30. Since I have the original Feels So Good LP, the cuts are jarring. I have since learned that A&M has come out with another CD, with the complete versions of the same playlist, from their ""Backlot Artists"" CD. My recommendation? Spend your money on the complete versions."
5,Wish he were still recording.,His Jazz is intelligent Jazz and we think of this album as a true classic.
2,Didn't send me,"Other than the well-known Feels So Good, the songs on this album didn't send me. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)"
3,Chuck Magione CD,"The first song, ""Feels So Good"", is one of my favorites (that is the main reason why I bought this CD). The rest of the compilation is easy listening and smooth."
4,"Great workbook, could be longer","Looking for a series of story adventures for your children and you to share? If your child is between four and about eight years old ""3-2-1 Penguins"" provides a complete storyline, activities, problems, discussion questions, crafts, Bible verses, coloring pages, and games. There are ten adventures in all, each of which stands on its own and so can be completed on whatever schedule works best for your family. Designed as a full family participation program for those with small children, it is a recommended method to teach some basic Biblical principles."
1,ripoff,"The ""rare musical performances"" amounted to a few seconds Joy Division performing. The whole dvd kept giving the viewer teaser shots if you will of live performances but never delivered. It never played a song in it's entirety. The ""rare interviews"" as described were garbled and very hard to understand. Very disappointing."
4,A nice starting point,"Any release self-deemed an'independent critical analysis' is more often than not, another namefor 'unauthorized cash-in attempt'. However, this 70-minute biooffers some historical documentation as well as some well-reasonedreflections and opinions on this legendary Manchester post-punk act.Led by the visionary (and troubled) vocalist Ian Curtis, Joy Divisionspearheaded a head-on collision between punk, pre-industrialelectronics, and experimental rock. From 1977 to their suddenimplosion in 1980 due to Curtis' untimely suicide, the group released2 forward-thinking studio LPs as well as numerous singles thatexplored everything from love to loss to isolation to loneliness tojubilation. Some writers who were around to experience the group'sheyday comment here, as well as associates and esteemed musicjournalists who respectfully reflect on the group's short butinfluential career. A nice career summation, and worth a viewing fordie-hard fans."
1,"Reference Yes, Learning or Instruction No","I purchased this book because the customer reviews were fairly positive. But this book is a lot like going on a scavenger hunt. Information is scattered throughout and it is your job to find it. For example, the term ""threads"" is referred to quite often early on but they don't define this term until midway through the book. I found myself jumping all over the place for either a definition or explanation."
2,Difficult to understand.,"I find this book difficult to understand, so I'm looking for another Java book to buy. (I'm an experienced programmer with 15 years in the industry but no OO experience.) For example, the authors cannot explain ""throwing"" and ""catching"" exceptions without using the words ""throw"" and ""catch"". This is like a dictionary defining a word by using that word in the definition. Sometimes these authors spend pages of your time giving you an overview that only serves to confuse you. Brief overviews are fine, but in most cases they should just get to the point. After reading some chapters, I've found myself reading the corresponding chapters in other Java books because I didn't feel as though I understood the material. Maybe the 2nd edition is better..."
1,A Puzzle Book,"In my opinion , this book is not for people who are willing to learn Java. I could hardly find what I want. I find myself in a puzzle while searching for a subject. While explaining something , it always refers to other pages and when you open these pages you could hardly return to the place where you've begun. So this book is only for experienced programmers."
2,NOT for BEGINNERS,"This was my textbook for a introductory college class for Java, and I never refer to it that much. Not too many examples to take a look at. It is good for a reference when you are more knowledgeable about Java. But don't think this is a handholding sort of book for the neophyte in Java. I wish there were more example for applets in the book. Anybody wants to buy my copy? The college bookstore is not buying it back, and I wonder just why."
3,Good for review or introduction,"The authors' tendency to skip to other sections of the book (web link style) is extremely annoying, but other than than that I found the explanations in each section helpful. I am using the extensive examples at the end to refresh for the Java Certification and find them helpful in conjunction with the chapter text. Used along with other source material it is a good introduction to the Java language."
2,Good Java overview for experienced programmers,"This is a good intro tutorial for experienced programmers familiar with Object-oriented programming(OOP), but people not familiar with an OOP language like C++ will find the explanations lacking and terminology confusing, even though it does try to explain OOP. For the experienced programmer, this books gives a good overview on the various features of the Java language, but you'll have to turn to another reference for more advanced subjects and class descriptions, though the CD does includes complete listing of the Java API. But this book can't really be recommended unless you have to have a book in front of you because the complete tutorial is freely available online and for download on Sun's site at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ where the tutorial is more up-to-date than the book."
2,Not a good Java book,"I used this book to try to figure out gridbags. Oh my were they complicated! I spent a day trying to figure it out, but the text and examples simply further confused me. The rest of the book was similar. Instead I picked up Sun's CORE Java Fundamentals - and it showed me just how easy gridbags are to use. It was obvious that this Campione/Walrath book neglected to explain the mere basics!"
2,"Good content, poor organization and poor writing skills","I found the first edition of this book very confusing. One of these authors isn't a very good writer. In the first section of the book, technical terms and concepts are used when they are not defined or defined much later. To learn Java from scratch, Java Handbook is much better."
3,Fair and not a tutorial,"This book is not a tutorial; it is not even really introductory.It does have some good explanations though. i bought thisd book because I have been trying to learn Java for the past 9 months. It isn't that the language is hard its the way it is taught!I will rate this book 3 stars; 3 stars for some good explanation. But the rest of the book is dumb examples and demonstrations, you will have to look up stuff at the Java web site to find out what exactly the methods mean. Also this book assumes you already know some basic java or whatever.If you have read some other java books fine buy this book, if not, beware; this book is only demonstrations without proper explanations.The purpose of a Java book should be to get the person reading it to apply what they study and I have yet to read such a book."
5,"Too expensive, but very good","I'm new in Java World. I read the on-line tutorial (java_tutorial.zip) from www.javasoft.com, and I find it very simply and good. It would be nice to win on the contest"
1,Not a book for beginners,"This book is awful. The examples are complex and confuse the issue rather than enlighten. The text does not illustrate the topics but in many cases simply lists them. There are many examples where in attempting to define a term , they use the term to define it. The book includes a trail map, but often it is a trial to follow it. The authors waste many lines of text simply predicting what the next paragraph will do. I do not recommend this book. A far better idea is too buy Bruce Eckel's ""Thinking in Java"" or Peter Van Der Linden's 'Just Java 1.2'"
5,Simply a great book,"In terms of painting style Taylor brings together the best elements of several artists to produce a classic impressionistic fresh watercolor style. The instructional material by Ron Ransom is extremely helpful. It even has a couple of pages in how to depict traffic in cityscapes! I also love Taylor's sensible 15 color palette (not too large, not to restricted) and how he employs it. No tricks--no pouring, salt, collage, stamping--just great loose on site plein air brushwork from a master. Somewhat similar in style to Mel Stabin or John Yardley."
5,Truly A Special Work Touched by GOD!,"The annoited Mississippi Mass Choir has done it again. This album is on fire for the Lord. Every piece on this album's set is crisp, spirit-filled, and annoited by the heavenly father. This CD/tape picks right up where ""Mississippi Mass Choir--Live in Mississippi"" leaves off. Put it in your stereo in your car, and you won't take it out."
2,Defective video,"Enjoyable movie Cisco Kid movie, but the video was defective. The first one I had had a 7 minute black out in the middle of it...the replacement copy had 5 minutes cut off at the end. So far, I have not had one that was correct."
3,OK quality,I bought this product for school. It was a great value and it fit the necessary requirements I needed it. Good value.
4,A Title for your Review,"It's a decent OChem textbook. The solutions manual is really well put together as it usually shows you where you went wrong. Otherwise, it's just a standard OChem text."
4,Satisfied Reader in Boston,"Jones really peaks my curiosity with this manuscript. I use the book in Honors Organic Chemistry class and I thank the teahcer daily for selecting it. Jones has definitely placed me on the path to becoming an Organic chemist. The book is presented in a well ordered fashion; all important facts, no matter how minute, are presented before unvailing the overall picture."
4,A nice non-textbook textbook,"This is the second year that the Honors Organic class at NYU has used Jones' text. Unlike many other orgo texts which are like reference books, Jones' book reads more like an interactive story. In order to get the most out of it, you have to read the sections in order, do the problems as Jones' poses them, and do ALL of the problems at the end of the chapter. Jones makes a didactic story out of some of the key concepts, often misleading the readers in an attempt to make them THINK. You WILL learn to THINK organic chemistry-- that is, if you make a *significant* investment of time. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK AS A REFERENCE, it will only frustrate you. If you are looking for a good reference book, try Wade and maybe Vollhardt. Jones' approach, however, is a nice alternative to the cold and dry classic texts. Oh, and NYU Honors Orgo '98-'99 RULES!"
2,Not the greatest,"I have 2 main complaints about this book. First of all, the author will go on and on and on for pages giving a detailed explanation only to say in the end that it is not correct. He thinks this is helpful, however, it is extremely confusing and an enormous waste of time. Also, he lacks the ability to present material in a simple, logical and concise way. For example, when presenting substitution and elimination reaction mechanisms, he goes on for 75 pages (yes, the chapter is 75 pages long!!) yet never simply lists the basics for determining which mechanism will occur. All you want is a simple table, for example, 1) SN2 - favored by primary carbon, polar aprotic solvent, strong nucleophile, etc. 2)SN1........ If you have to get this book, purchasing the solution manual is a must. One good thing, the author is entertaining - read footnotes, etc. - and he tells cute anecdotes."
4,A Good Introduction to OChem....,"Jones' text is definitely an interesting introduction to organic chemistry. You manage to actually see some of the reason why a mechanism works in the way it does, why reactions turn out the way they do, which I happen to like. Which can be a distinct difference from the way most OChem courses are taught...which is a good thing. Of course, the text also has its flaws. It makes for a horrible reference text. Tables, charts, etc. are spread through the text and not collated in a back of the book appendix. Sure, you can check the index, but what a waste of valuable energy that could be spent doing problems. :) Also, I found the historical anecdotes either funny or annoying, depending on my mood. All in all, a solid book for an OChem course."
5,orgo book review,Seller was quick to ship my books. Books arrived in the correct condition I was informed they would arrive in. Seller had the cheapest deal for the Jones organic chemistry book and solutions manuel. Very satisfied.
3,Adiquate,"Chapters are well written, but problem sets are vaguely worded, leaving room for multiple interpretations. This makes class discussion and grading much more complicated than necessary."
2,performed well for a while,"I have owned this as well as another adjustable type dimpler. I really prefered this one over the adjustable type which was slightly wobbly and did not always hold an adjustment for very long. After only occasional non profesional use, This dimpler started popping open and dropping the bit. I may buy another but if it fails again I'll loose faith in this gadget."
3,Works OK.,The drywall dimpler works pretty well as long as you have the gun perfectly perpendicular to the wall. The slightest off angle does not allow the screw to properly dimple the drywall. Had good luck with it on wall seams and ceiling seems. Not as much luck on the corners close to the edge.
4,Beta 1.3/1.6-Glucan 100mg,"I use this product as an immune booster, especially during a viral attack. I immune system seem to respond well as did othersI shared this product."
1,The 2 pack is not included in Sales Price,I thought this was a really good deal for two items as indicated. However I was charged for the two items individually. NOT A GOOD Deal at all. Very misleading presentation!
4,Great Product!,Great Product at a great price compared to other sources. I would definitely recommend this product after a lot of interent shopping and reviewing others.
4,Good Product,I was using a higher priced Beta Glucan with great results. I was looking for a lower cost alternative and this one works well. I'd recommend it to a friend.
5,This album is full of BEAUTIFUL tracks...,"I do not own the CD, but I have the LP passed on to me by my father...and it's a little over two decades old! All the songs are great, and it is evident that Barbieri is passionate in his playing...especially in ""Europa"". This album is definitely a must have. All the songs are beautiful!"
4,Great CD,"Cd was refered by a friend. I found the CD fantastic, great listening. I would recommend this CD to any music lover."
4,Still simmers,One of Jazz's more fiery blowers excelled at delivering vibrantly funky night music for lovers during his 70's heyday.
5,Test of time,"I saw Gato at the Bottom Line in NY in1980 when he performed this album in its entirety. The performance was asreal as the record with a fervor I haveseldom heard from anyone playing live.The album stands on its merit over 20years later, I have seen Gato 2 othertimes and he is an incredible musicianand showman."
5,This album is fantastic.,"I really enjoyed this album. Gato Barbieri has the power to relax and electrify, on the same album. He wraps his music around your heart and takes you places that you've never been. This is a must have for all Gato fans."
4,Hot.,Some of the most intense listening for a saxophone lover. His performance on this album creates magical images of fire and smoke. All while making love on a water bed. No children please.
2,Jazz vs. Peanut Butter: Creamy or Chunky?,"Some people like Crunchy peanut butter. Some like Creamy.In jazz, some people like the funky, visceral grit of Mingus or the quirky genius of Monk, and others like the more contemporary, tranquil sounds of Kenny G or Najee.Those who prefer the former should, as I did, take measures to avoid purchasing this slick, poppy, modern-sounding CD.Those that prefer the latter will no doubt enjoy this CD as much as, say, Manhattan Transfer, or perhaps David Sanborn, who Gato sounds a little bit like, with a slightly raspier tone, less honking tone.This reminds me of a joke I heard the other day:What did Sanborn say when he stepped into an elevator?""Man, this place ROCKS!"""
4,"MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE",Although Carlo Rustichelli is'nt as high profile as some of the other Spaghetti Western composers (ie: Ennio Morricone and Luis Bacalov) this is a first rate score in every respect. The film is a western version of CARMEN and has been scored for Spanish Guitar and full orchestra. An outstanding CD well worth adding to any soundtrack collection.
5,"What a great book, thanks Pat","My preferred reading, so full of tips, tricks and golden words. It is a must for any Alfa owner. It makes it easy to understand everything a layman can do with his car."
2,"Not really usefull, nice read though","Once you start working on an alfa, you will see that there are numerous differences in engine types, carburetors, and general setup. Especially as an owner of an 100% original Alfetta GTV (the one the book is mostly about) I was hapered by the fact that it doesn't cover dellorto carburators, which are the most common in europe, and it also fails to tell you how you get the engine out of the car, which is hell if you don't know how to do it with this specific car. thirdly there is no mention of cylinderhead differences, which makes you assume they are all thesame, which they are not. Too bad, but completely useless once you start revising the engine, or any part of the car, because only part of the information is available. You'd be better off buying a maintenance manual from Alfa themselves."
4,Good all purpose beginner's guide...,"I enjoyed this book. It provided a broad perspective of the marquee and it's history. Although the book does not give great detail for diagnosis and repair, it provides enough information for anyone with common sense and mechanical inclinations. The best I've seen on the subject."
2,Owners Bible For Spica,"A nice read with lots of history and tidbits, however, not very useful if you are looking to make repairs or get information on post 1980 Alfa Romeos. If you have a Spica injection system this book is probably a must. I did appreciate the history and commentary. I don't think it quite rates the title ""Alfa Romeo Owners Bible"" as there are a few psalms missing."
3,"Well, not really a bible...","Pat Braden was clearly an enthusiast of the Alfa marque and one held in high regard by many longtime peers. That said, the title of this book is misleading. The author's emphasis on a relative few models and the omission of others of significance make this book much less than the authoritative compendium of Alfa Romeo knowledge the name implies. It is not without merit: there is a good deal of useful general information for owners of some of the most commercially successful models. But, for many true enthusiasts who live and breathe the Alfa Romeo experience, it falls well short of being a standard reference tome."
3,No Information On The Boxer Engine - Otherwise a Good Read,The book is a very interesting read (great cover) but potential buyers should be aware that there is no information regarding the boxer engine.
3,Okay,This book is okay. I like a few of the designs but probably could have gotten just as much from google for free
3,Not very memorable.,"I read this little more than a week ago and I can barely remember anything about it. Its a fertility clinic where most of the female employees seem to be overly (plot devicey) fertile.The relationship between our hero and heroine is rather sweet, as he can be a cantakerous work-a-holic, and she is his devoted personal assistant. (the assisting got really personal, hence the title)There are some pretty steamy scenes, that usually end abruptly because he puts his foot in his mouth.I'd reccomend it for a bit of pointless fluff, but it isn't the best I've ever read."
4,Lord of the Nile,Lord of the Nile is a great continuation of the Children of the Lion series. It is one of the sadder books with many beloved characters making sad life changes or dying. There is a deep sense of caring about Shobi's twins by his friends. Tuya's life is very sad and you feel she deserves better than she gets. The ending makes you want to immediately begin the next book so you find out what is going to happen.
5,A Must-Have for Parties,"I bought these a few years back and have used them at every bar-b-que, party and camping trip. Everyone loves them! It's nice to be able hold them with one hand and have everything you need right there. I always double the paper plates then put napkin and utensils in and hand them out as people make their plates. If you're also serving soup, stew, queso, etc., just put it in a cup and stick it in the cup holder. I'm buying a couple more sets of these for friends and family."
4,Mr. Thorn,"This is a children's book about a little girl, her cat, her mom, and Mr. Thorn. Mr. Thorn came over to help mom with some paperwork. But Mr. Thorn didn't like cats, or children."
2,Don't Buy Sparknotes Test Prep.. of any kind,"The AP Power pack seems like a good idea and it does implement some useful strategies and tools such as the time lines and flash cards. Unfortunately, these tools are as incomplete as everything Sparknotes provides. The cards are often very unclear, and provide misleading and false information (such as connecting loose government with Federalism), and the time lines are incomplete (such as forgetting important events like the Proclamation of 1763). The test questions are poorly worded and have horrific support from the answer explanations. Sample essays are unrealistically long and demonstrate practices AP teachers would tell you to specifically avoid (such as citing documents in an introduction). All in all avoid Sparknotes, seek other forms of study."
3,Nice book but has flaws,This is a good book for students. My only complaint is there are a number of errors. It should have been checked by Fritz
1,Six months and dead,"It's an EQ with both balanced and unbalanced in and outs in the back for two channels. Each channel has a gain and 15 band EQ with low-cut and EQ bypass buttons. It's a simple product with no bells and whistles intended to provide basic sound EQ.Pros of the equipment, it works like it should, while it works. Cons, it doesn't work long. Just under 6 months into ownership using it only once a week, channel 1 quit working completely.I remember when the less expensive sound equipment would last at least a year or two, but 6 months and dead? Warranty, 90 days. Come on! Yes, this is a cheap price for a basic 2 channel EQ but now Nady is tarnishing their name with product quality that doesn't even match the price. If I knew it was this cheap I would have rather wasted $60 on Pyle's EQ instead of $85 on this, which are apparently of equal quality now."
4,great quality for price paid,great quality of sound . very easy setup xlr inputs and outputs for 60 bucks what else can you ask
1,No RCA inputs or outputs.,"I ordered the Nady GEQ-215 because it is advertised as having unbalanced RCA inputs and outputs. It now has only 1/4"" and XLR ins and outs. It also no longer has the ground lift switch. It comes with an ungrounded IEC power cable. I am very disappointed and am going to return the thing."
2,Outputs differ from those pictured in manual,"I can't comment yet on the audio quality of this device because I can't properly hook it up to my sound system! It has XLR outputs on back but they are unbalanced, as witnessed by the *extreme* level of hum generated. The manual (both the pdf version available online as well as the printed document that came with the EQ) shows a rear panel that differs a great deal from the product I received. It clearly shows balanced XLR outputs and my EQ doesn't have them, nor does it have the ground lift switch nor the voltage selector.Shipping a product which differs *significantly* from the online description is unacceptable. I wanted to give it one star, but to be fair I'm not even able to test the device! Big thumbs down for shipping me a different product than the one I thought I was buying!For those who might buy this, here's what the back panel DOES have:* AC connector* 1/4"" and XLR balanced inputs* 1/4"" and XLR unbalanced outputThat's it!"
2,Only works on one channel,I expected two channels meant two stereo channels. Apparently left and right are each a channel. And only one works. Which makes this only slightly more useful than a rock...I've emailed them just now and will see what they suggest to do.
5,The Batman: Season Four,I recommend this product to any Batman fan. It's cleverly written and portrays the storyline right to the point. I'm a huge The Batman fan and will always continue to be. This DVD is awesome!
3,Batman 's always cool,"I know that for most of the Batman fans,the new series of ""the Batman"" does not equal the masterpiece that was the animated series from director Bruce Timm. The stories are not complex enough and maybe a little too childish. But I like Jeff Matsuda's designs and the animation is quite good. I feel that with this last season ""The Batman"" show quit improved."
3,the batman -the complete fourth season,"Very enjoyable as ever ,this season see the batman teaming up with Robin(as it was meant to be!!!!!).Found the kids watching this dvd over and over."
3,bad disc,"We bought this dvd as a gift for a reletive. When he started to watch it he found the 1st disc to be unplayable. By the time he got to actually watch the dvd, the return date had allready passed."
4,You Will Use This One,"How to Write Western novels is one of those books you buy to keep next to your computer. Matt Braun gives solid advise on various sub-genres of the western, how they are structured, character building, finding your voice, and knowing your setting. I am just revising a western. You'd better believe I am using it. Thank you Matt!"
3,Wild-Eyed Southern Boys was OK,I found that the track Fantasy Girl was my favorite and still is. The rest of the CD was just not of my liking for the most part although I could see that 38 Special diehards would find this CD to be very good.
5,Best 38 Special album,"This is the best .38 Special album ever with great songs like; Hold on Loosely, First Time Around, Wild-Eyed Southern Boys and Fantasy Girl. This album also has similarities to their other albums. Overall this is an awesome CD from a classic band. This is a must have for any Southern Rock, Classic Rock or any Rock fan to have. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Review for bandsaw blade,This blade was very good. I bought this blade to cut hardwood and thats what it did. Also it was hard finding this exact size but Morse was the only available brand that had it. Overall great purchase will buy another one if something happens to my current one.
5,Excellent Worship,I have this cd and.had worn it out. I thought I would never find it again to replace it. I love it I can worship at home or anywhere with it and it is powerfully anointed with the presence of the Holy Spirit.
2,very poorly put together.,"when i got the floor mates i could see just how crappy they were put together, i would not recommend this to any one. and did not give it to my friend for his b-day."
3,a corely band.,another band with jason corley i think. he is probably best known for his work with the band 16. this is sludgy stoner doom. drunken vile shenanigans. think eyehategod with more straight forward focused songs.
4,A great addition to any home system,The HK AVR110 is a Rolls in the world of audio...the clarity is well worth the price. As everyone goes by basic wattage output in rating a receiver then you must explorer the world of Harman Kardon. The 50 watt output is better than any 100 watt receiver I have ever tried.The unit has that basic raw power that is desired of any unit but usually reserved for the pricey products. I would recommend the AVR110 to anyone.
3,Mine lasted 5 months ... but replaced by HK,"My AVR 110 was a great unit, but failed quite soon after I received it. Then was in repair for quite some time. Once I contacted Harmon Kardan directly though, they decided I had waited long enough without a receiver and replaced it for me. I appreciated the gesture and hope my new unit is more sturdy. It is a great sounding piece of equipment."
1,Ballet Good - Deal Bad,"Absolutely beautifully filmed and the best version of the ballet; Covent Garden, georgeous costumes, you can actually see what the dancers' movements are. You can imagine my utter disappointment when I find out there is no sound!! Knowing I can't return the dvd after it has been opened, I re-examined your listing. The dvd is compatible for Zone 1, so what is wrong? Then I see in fine print, you need a pal compatible player to watch it with the music. Perhaps these critical details should be in large bold print. I don't hate this version, it's wonderful, just hate the fact I spent that much money for something I can't watch. Do something to warn your customers."
5,Rough Riders Vol 2,I have all the Rough Riders movies and find them a pleasure to watch and they hold pride of place in my dvd cabinet
1,Fraud,"Of all the human foibles, religion may be the most interesting; it is certainly the most destructive. Scientology, however, stands apart. Unlike those religions with antecedents safely hidden in distant - and unprovable - myths, Scientology (and to some extent Mormonism)is recent enough that its origins can be firmly and absolutely confirmed...and it takes but a few moments to realize that this is both a bad joke and a deliberate fraud. Jos. Smith may have been nuts, but Hubbard was a confidence man with a perverse sense of humour. The good news about Scientologists and most other religious nuts is that wave their insanity in public and may thus be publicly identified and avoided. I'm not sure why human society needs a lunatic fringe, but must admit that life would be boring without them."
5,A pleasant departure from the norm!,"Finally! A fresh new voice, and a departure from the mind numbing array of expert opinion fly fishing books that are floating around these days. Brown won't tell you how you should catch a tarpon on the fly, but he will tell you why! This is an entertaining book for the saltwater fly fisherman, and a beautifully bound edition for the angling book collector."
1,Not worth the money,"For the amount of money asked, I was expecting more information about tarpon, gear, and fishing tactics. Instead, what I got was a testimonial that one person likes to fish for tarpon - plus a short history of one former fishing site."
4,Truly enjoyable!,I've had this CD for a couple years now. My favorite song is Keep Oil in Your Lamp. An awesome song! This CD is a definite must for your gospel music collection.
3,Good research but bad writing.,"This book is a good source of history about the Kentucky River but is very difficult to read. The writing is awful, as Mr Ellis often changes topics in the middle of a paragraph and punctuates erratically. This book is heavy on recollections of old-timers on the river, but light on photos, maps, and illustrations that would help to make the book a lot clearer.Only buy this book if you have a deep interest in the history of Kentucky or America's rivers. If you don't have a driving interest in one of those subjects this book will put you to sleep."
4,Puts the Kentucky into Perspective,"Mr. Ellis does a good job of putting the Kentucky River into both its historical and contemporary perspectives. His research is outstanding, and he provides in-depth coverage of the geographic, historic, economic, cultural and social significance of the river.His analysis of the contemporary problems the river faces is especially thought provoking.Anyone who has grown up or lived on the banks of the Kentucky will find it highly interesting and entertaining."
1,"Garish Blue, Not Clear Or Silver","I bought these because I hated the amber looking lens, I wanted a clean, clear look on my headlights.These do look better than the orange bulbs they replaced, but unfortunately, these still don't give a monochrome look. You now have a bright blue, Easter egg looking bulb in your turn signal housing. It also gives off different colors in different lighting, and it still does give off an amber color in certain lights.On some applications I can see it working, but I felt it looked too ""ricer"" for my taste.I ended up just buying actual silver/chrome coated bulbs that light up Amber. They were much cheaper, and had a cleaner look than these fluoroscent blue blobs at each end of my headlights."
2,streetpilot c340 case,"THis case did not fit my needs. I like to carry the unit, accessories including the friction mount I use in one carrying case."
5,garmin carrying case,this product is perfect for the garmin c330. compact and tight for a secure fit. i recommend buying this product.
3,GPS case,Purchased 06/06/09 / it is a tight fit you have to work to put C330 Garmin in the case.I would have liked a little larger case.Good quality so overall I am satisfied.
4,Garmin Case Fits Need,"The case is very convient in both size and ease of use. We can store the power cord, the stand and the Garmin in the case and transport it easily.I have not owened it long enough to see how it holds up."
5,Fits like a glove,It fits great and includes room for the cord too. It's a must have to protect your unit if you need to store it between uses.
1,not suitable for my garmin,The case was not suitable for my garmin. It was the incorrect size & shape. I need to return it. This is probably why it was for sale on Amazon.
4,"Tight fit, but nice case","I recently purchased this case, but I found that it is a tight fit if you use the suction cup mount. I currently have the dash mount base attached, and it fits perfectly. You can keep the power cord and GPS unit securely together. I then keep this in a small canvas tool bag ( 10"" Craftsman) for extra protection, and to store the dash mount base. I like the fact that the GPS unit is well protected by this case. I would recommend it to everyone."
2,Sounds like nothing special & weak versions of other bands,"I first heard of Deepest Blue from the 'Deepest Blue' John Hopkins Mix on the Ministry of Sounds Chillout Sessions 2004 CD. I really love this version of the song & this made me want to track down the bands other works, this CD.Well, I know the track I love & still strongly recommend is a remix. That remix's are always different from the bands original version of the song but I was really amazed just how different it was. I expected something more in lines the the other Ministry of Sounds CD's I have.What I got was a weak, cross between erasure & Savage Garden! That was a shock, there are good songs on the album but nothing as strong as either band unfortunately.Also the remix CD has not go the 'Deepest Blue' John Hopkins Mix on it either. The remix CD is nothing & is nothing special in anyway.All in all, very disappointed in the CD's but still recommend tracking down Chillout Sessions 2004 & sticking with the John Hopkins Mix on that album."
4,This speakers are WAY Overpriced,If you really want portable speakers that sound great and cost a lot less go for the Bose Mediamates. They have exceptional sound quality for their size and price. Search for them and read my review on the Bose Mediamate! If you just want great speakers that go even louder than the Bose and have room shaking bass and can afford expesnive ones go for the Bose Companion 3! It is an AMAZING speaker system and it is like $20 more dollars than htis Sony speakers... go to www.bose.com and take a look at it under the Game and PC Section!
4,They do not make movies like this anymore,"It is always a pleasure to watch a movie without violence, bad language and shouting. This with James Garner and Debbie Reynolds excelling in their roles, it makes for a top notch film."
3,Sushi,This book took really long to come in...almost a month. But it's good if you have company alot and want to impress them.
3,DK's Sushi Chronicles,"Cookbook was shipped quickly...however, was shipped in a soft package envelope so ended up bent and tattered by the time I received. They should ship in cardboard box to avoid damage and if that is an extra charge they should offer the option to the customer. Very unprofessional!!!!!"
2,Actually a measuring cup set,"These are not actually prep bowls as stated in the description. They are also much smaller than they look in the picture. The box actually says they are ""Measuring cups"". The largest is 1 cup. The others are 1/2cup, 1/3cup, and 1/4cup. They are labeled on the bottoms. As a set of TINY prep bowls, I suppose they work well. Measuring cups, however, really need a longer handle. Because the description is too vague and they don't work well for their actual intended purpose, I gave this item 2 stars."
1,Not Made in the USA,"I bought these bowls as an alternative to plastic, made in China baby food bowls. I was thrilled when I found them, since they are stainless steel and advertised as made in the USA. I was so disappointed when they arrived today with Made in China stamped on the box."
3,Would be better with video,"Obviously, some of the ""Classic"" events of the sporting world are stunning when heard. Before live television, this was all there was. Sportscasters knew how to broadcast with energy and adjectives to paint the picture. For modern events, sportscasters are so unprepared to radio broadcasts, the listener isn't ""in the game."" This book, though the selections are appropriate, would be better supplimented with a DVD of the sports highlights."
2,Another so so 2.4 GHz...,"Well, for all of you that don't know, Toshiba cordless phones are made by UNIDEN. It has a different casing, but the internal circuits are entirely the same, so the quality is identical to the 2.4 GHz Uniden phones. One word to summarize the quality of this phone--echo! It echos like crazy, reminds me the early 900 MHz DSS phones. If you want a really good phone, go for Panasonic... VTech make phones for a lot of brands, including AT&T. Heck, they owned the right to market phones under the AT&T brand. This applies to Sony and other name brands. I think the only company design and make their own phones is Panasonic. That's why alot of the echoing or static problems appear phone after phone, because they are all made by Uniden, VTech, or a couple of Korean companies..."
3,Toshiba SG1700 2.4 GHz Silver Cordless Phone,This phone has great features such as volume control and light up numbers. It's crystal clear with no background noise or static. My biggest complaint is the echoing. It's really annoying. Although the people you are speaking with can't hear the echo. I prefer Toshiba's 900MGZ phones with much better quality.
1,toshiba sg 1700,"Piece of garbage. Horrible distance. reliability stinks, especially the buttons. Would definitley recommend not buying this phone, no matter what the cost."
1,Toshiba failed me:-(,"This phone (stinks)... I bought it not even a year ago and its dead already. It was never dropped or abused in any way. It also suffered from feedback when I used the microwave( which my new cheapie 2.4 GHz GE colors phone doesnt suffer from:-/ ) I used to love Toshiba, oh wells..."
2,"Decent hand-held cordless, unacceptable with headset","The phone is fairly convenient. The sound quality is good. However, when using the headset jack for hands-free operation, the transmitted volume (your voice as heard by your callers) is unacceptably low; when tested with 2 different handsets that work fine with other corded and cordless telephones."
2,basketball shoes,The shoe's ankle support is too rigid and has never loosened up in spite up repeated usage.
3,Thanks but no thanks,"The bracelet is nice, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I was trying to replace a stolen Venetian Link Bracelet and the links are a little bigger than I had thought. Not a big deal, I'll get used to it, trying to replace something can be hard. The length was a little weird too, I never thought I'd need the 8 inch since I don't feel like I have big wrists. I was wrong. Oops. It's a little tight, but I can deal with that.The issue I had was that when I initiated a return I got NO response. That made me MAD. I would have exchanged it for the larger one, but I never got contacted and frankly I'm a bit of a bum and missed my deadlines with Amazon to fix it. All that did is leave me annoyed and bitter that I didn't follow up. All in all, it's a pretty bracelet, but the lack of service means I won't buy from them again."
5,"Insightful, Enriching and Courageous","Not being a scholar myself, I appreciated the not too cerebral approach Noll took in explaining the complexities of historical and cultural events as well as the emotional topic(s)that ensued. Nolls 'epistle' was exciting to read as myself and so many others in the Church have questioned whether the bros. & sisters are preaching sound doctrine or have some of them gone off the deep end: ""bereft of self-criticism, intellectual subtlety, or an awareness of complexity--are blown about by every wind of apocalyptic speculation and enslaved to the cruder spirits of populist science."" To deny the serious issues plaguing the Church and the validity of those issues,that Noll has bravely exhorted us to take a close look at, is more 'wounding' than what any enemy could accomplish. Self-critical introspection is paramount to a mature Christian faith and Church. Even when it pains us, we also should take courage and challenge our complacency."
5,How American Christianity got the way it is.,"Noll is not some sarcastic sniper; he is an evangelical believer and meticulous scholar who traces the history of Christianity in America to explain why so much Christian ""thought"" today is shallow and non-rational. Noll lays a great foundation for combining faith with intellect. Christianity Today's pick for Book of the Year, 1995"
3,The History of the Evangelical Mind and the ensuing scandal,"This book tracks the history of Evangelicals in America, emphasising intellectual contributions made. It attempts to discover and explain the different forces that have shaped the collective mind of Modern Day Evangelicals in America.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the history of American evangelicalism or Christian scholarship in general."
4,Not for the Weak of Mind or Faith,"This is strong admonition for the church to wake up and shape up in its discretion. Such an outstanding historian as Noll would do well to give us a major tome on the history of the church from the perspective of its reaction to clear thinking and education. The church of emotional seems to have been surging and popular these days, so aptly titled by Packer ""Hot Tub Christianity."" An insight many are already aware of and trying to turn around in the church, Noll puts in such a marvelous word construct: ""should help evangelicals realize that much of what is distinctive about American evangelicalism is not essential to Christianity."" This says much of where we're at and where we need reform."
4,Hard questions for the Evangelical Church,"A good history of the church in North America, and the division between the mainline church and the the fundamental branch of the church. Noll details the criss of the evangelical mind that follows."
4,a rallying cry,"Noll's ""epistle of love"" should be must reading for all who confess the name of Jesus, especially those who are considered ""evangelical.""The Church as a whole must reengage into all areas of culture. We must truly love God with ALL our hearts, ALL of our minds, ALL of our soul, and ALL of our strength. Noll traces the history of the evangelical church and how it has managed to avoid engaging modern society across a broad spectrum of areas. He poses good questions. The Church must answer.This is a rallying cry. Let us fly to the banner."
4,Funny Business!!,"A laugh out loud book! Of course, I'm in it,so it stands to reason that I know it's funny. Judy has really done a stellar job bringing the funny and humorous to the public!"
1,When you take someone's property-at least say PLEASE!,"""Kudos to Judy""...A ""steller job""??? Of what? Typing up OTHER people's creativity and getting paid for it? I gave no permission, nor did any friend I've asked, to be reproduced in any of her books. I'm lucky, Judy hasn't seen me for years. She's using old jokes for me. But, I see new, up and coming comics, who haven't had their HBO special or even a shot on ""Premiam Blend"" yet before she's burning their jokes on the rubber chicken circuit. AND, she's having book signings? Who's name is she signing? Singers have to pay royalties. Please people, buy the books and CD's of the comics you like, then do their best jokes. At least, you'll be paying the right person commission. Diane Nichols"
4,Love is a mystery,"I read this book when it was first published, which was soon after Bob Ballard had discovered the Titanic's resting place. ""Nicole"" kindled a fascination with the Titanic that I still have today (don't get me started on the movie). I was a big fan of the Sunfire series (I guess I still am :D), and I felt Candice Ransom's books were usually the best of the bunch. ""Nicole"" features one of my all-time favorite characters in Price: witty, insightful, charming, intelligent, cute, wealthy; he had a brave, adventurous spirit (a baronet running away from home!) - who could resist that?! (Not I, which is why I gave this only 4 stars!)I hope Scholastic (or whoever now owns the Sunfire rights) reprints these titles. These books are what sparked my love of American history. I hope they do the same for millions of young women."
3,Not one of the better ones.,"Although it was not a terrible book it was not one of the better ones. I found it very predictable and dull. It was about a rich New Yorker whos mother has spent the last of their wealth in buying tickets for the Titanic voyage home. On which her mother hopes for Diana to become engaged to the rich Price so as to restore their fortune, but Diana falls in love with Karl a poor immagrant. But before her mother excepts Karl the Titanic starts to sink! Will Karl and Price suvive? Will her mother? Will she???"
2,Not extremely useful,I've only used this book a few times and find it hardly useful. There are quite a few brands and products that I use that aren't listed in this book. This book is small and difficult to use. There also seems to be a stong bias to certain brands only. You'll get just as much use reading the back of packages yourself or reading the plastic bags in the produce department. Don't waste you money.
2,Don't waste your money on this one,"Other than ""Don't You Forget About Me,"" and ""We Are Not Alone,"" this soundtrack is basically garbage. Don't waste your money on this one, get these two tracks from other sources and forget the rest. There, you were warned."
3,The Breakfast Club and its music captured the spirit of the 80s,"If I had to pick one song to represent the 1980s I would, without hesitation, choose Simple Minds' ""Don't You (Forget About Me)."" Released in the middle of the decade, from one of the Eighties' finest films (The Breakfast Club), the song seemed to capture and celebrate all that came before it while communicating the promise of greater things yet to come. ""Don't You"" will forever remind me of the many times my friends and I took my company car to Vail in the middle of the night for nothing more than a coke and candy bar; I had the song on a cassette when it began climbing the charts and we listened to it over and over the first time we made the trip up the mountain from Denver. Not too long ago I heard Nina Blackwood (of MTV fame) say that ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" was originally written for Billy Idol."
4,"Totally...like.....fer real, dude!",Wow! The memories! This cd is so much fun! I palyed track one over and over. Reminds me so much of the 80's.
5,A Riot!,"The Breakfast Club is one of my all-time favorite movies and soundtracks. It reminds me much of my own school days, though I won't say which character I most relate to. While the entire collection is a must have for any fan, my favorite song in this is by Simple Minds, ""Don't You (Forget about me)"". My favorite line in the movie: ""Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?"" is a riot!"
5,80's Exemplified,"This is one of the prizes in my cd collection. I decided to purchase the cd version of it after wearing out 2 cassette tapes in my earlier years.While ""Don't You"" is by far the most well-known cut on the cd - if you've seen the movie - and consider it a classic like the rest of us who were in high school in 1983 - 1984, then this will conjer up scenes of the movie immediately and also bring a smile to your face.So, if you are a child of the 80's - and a connoisseur of the John Hughes era - this album IS for you! Buy it and see for yourself. ;)"
2,Not His Best,Joe Lovano is usually at the top of his game but this is just too slow for one album. Most song if not all have no beat what so ever and just too dull.
5,This book is a historical gem.,"Truly, this writer is a historian. The size of the book had me somewhat concerned prior to reading. However, I am glad I took the plunge. Wow! I just finished this book yesterday, and much to my chagrin, I discovered how much history I did not know. Even though this book is a novel, it is jammed packed with truisms. She dealt with the difficult history of race i.e. white president, black slave, and all of the dynamics of the era. It is not an easy read and some of the family letters did become somewhat cumbersome near the end. The book left me wanting to know more about the Civil War. She skillfully placed human characteristics on our historical figures. As a result of reading the book I am going to buy her previous work ""Sally Hemings"" to provide me the background. Educational read."
1,I wouldn't recommend this provider,"The cookbook came smelling so strongly of cigarettes that I couldn't use it, so I threw it out. The book was in good shape, but the smell was intolerable."
1,A sucker born every minute,Hal Lindsey has written one disaster fear mongering book after another. They all have one thing in common. They have all been wrong. And the suckers keep buying.
1,He only cares about evangelicals.,"I have read all of his books over a course of many years.Eachbook is frightening and creates a great deal of fear in thereader.I can understand why many people believe what he saysbecause his words are so based on negativity.His love for Israel has little to due with the Jewish people,for he believes those who do not follow Christianity in the end will suffer in Hell,a sad destiny for people he professes to respect and love.His hatred of Islam and Muslims is dangerous.He will only createa religious war of thought in the minds of his followers.Thuscreating a path to destruction politically and personally.Israel for an evangelical is merely a road to salvation,I don'tsee much of a heart for the people involved unless they areevangelicals."
5,Miss. mass Choir,Absolutely wonderful gospel songs that I would NoT be without! Exellent & came timely.
3,I feel like odd man out but....,"I really want to love this album but i just dont. As far as liveliners, rhythmic clapping, chorus voices modulating from one key to another well it's just not there no matter how many times i listen to it. And having such a rather negative review makes me feel like odd man out. What am i missing??"
2,Upset,"The description says it is a ""flex fit"", but it has an adjustable strap, that they do not show in the picture. In the picture, the back is plain-no strap. Now, we have lost $7+ dollars in shipping, that you do not get refunded when you return or exchange. My son is upset."
2,Not a good phone,"My wife and I dislike two key functions of this phone. First, the answering device has very poor sound quality. No matter how clearly I enunciated, the greeting message would always sound dreadful. Second, there was a strange reverberating buzz every time I spoke. Changing the volume did not affect the buzz. I wonder these quality defects are correlated with the reduced price and the offer of free shipping?"
4,I bought this phone before reading the reviews,"I am a new user to Amazon and didn't realize that there was a review section. I ordered the Toshiba SX2980 not knowing that it had bad customer reviews. When I learnt of the review section and read the comments I tried to cancel my order, but the order had already been processed. I received the phone fully expecting to return it the same day. However, since trying the phone, I have had no problems with echoes or time delays. The features are great and the sound quality is excellent. I would not have ordered this phone based on the reviews, but I'm very glad I did."
2,Sound quality is poor,"The features on this phone are great, but there is an echo in the receiver that makes it intolerable. We sent it back."
1,awful,These are awful teething biscuits. I had read reviews on how they didn't break from everyone but my son who was 11 months took one chomp and the a giant peice came right off. I wouldn't order again.
5,Buffy meets Ultraman(?),"A friend of mine in my college's anime club described Figure 17 as ""Buffy meets Ultraman"", and that's not far off the mark. That being said, I found it engaging and fun, with a minimum of silliness except where absolutely necessary.Others have detailed the content, so I won't bother. What I find most interesting is the ability to merge the two plots (SF adventure/monster fights in the vein of Ultraman and a coming-of-age story of a little girl who moves from the big city to the country). The result is a tight story, intentionally made paced slower than most anime, which makes the viewer really care about the characters."
2,Didn't care for it,"Too much ""play"" in the velcro once seated... caused me concern over long term holding power, or whether I'd have to keep adjusting it. Otherwise it looked like a quality product.I returned it because of the velcro movement issue."
1,Dead Beats,"I have tried for over a month to do business with Best Price Mirror through Amazon with NO results. Promised emails and return calls have not gotten the product that I ordered. Just cancel the order and refund the remainder of my money. The first time that you don't do what you say is a mistake. The second time is a shame. After that you are just a liar. If you expect to stay in business this way, good luck. I will forward my experience with you (and your man named ""Peter"") to my very extensive email list and will recommend that each of them do the same. That should reach several thousand potential customers in the next 24 hours. Amazon should consider their business arrangement with Best Price Mirror."
4,Decent shoe,"I purchased these shoes to replace a worn out identical pair I purchased years ago from a Columbia outlet store. Although identical in name, style, size and appearance, this new pair isn't quite as comfortable as the old pair. Maybe this new pair just need to be broken in a little more. Still a decent shoe for the price."
1,Columbia has left the building. Where'd ya go?,I would go out of my way to find Columbia footwear solely because I always had tremendous respect for the quality put behind their product. Until a few years ago a bought a pair of Columbia Men's Pagora Trail Shoes for myself and a pair of Columbia Youth Beartooth Shoes for my son and we both experienced foot and leg pain while wearing them. Neither of us felt this while wearing any other footwear we owned.I pretty much threw in the towel on Columbia until I decided to give them another shot. Mistake. I purchased a pair of Columbia Men's Birkie Trail shoes in good faith. but guess what?Same problem with the aches and pains.Won't buy again.
5,My favorite shoes,"I'm on my forth pair of these shoes. I wear them nearly everywhere. I get a year or so on them before I demote them to work shoes and purchase another pair for my ""good"" shoes. After work shoe life, they get demoted to lawn mowing shoes/jump in mud/stomp out campfire* shoes (*don't try this at home). That is about 3 years of abuse and then its time to toss them. None of the Columbia Birke Tail shoes I have had have been defective and they have always held up to my rough treatment. I have not experienced a blow out with any of them. I have many of Columbia's clothing products and really like the quality of all of them."
2,Not What They Used To Be,"I have worn this style shoe for as long as it has been out. I typically get about a years wear out of them. However, I recently started experiencing leg pain and lower back pain by late afternoon every work day. I noticed that the soles of my shoes are very worn after only 5 months. I work indoors, and spend most of the day at my desk or in the server room. My daily routing does not lend to excessive wear or my shoes. Based on my experience and other similar reviews, this will be my last pair. I just ordered a pair of Clarks."
2,SLOW,The delieve is too slow!I am waiting my shoes until today!I just confused that why it will delayed until a week!I feel displeasure!!! VERY VERY DISPLEASURE!
3,Good start,"This CD is just a tease. I am not sure I understand why he did this CD. If he wants to give those who listen to Latin music something to enjoy he needs to do it correctly. If he needs help he should listen to Julio Iglesias ""La Carretara"". This CD creates a mood and flow parallel to Stings English releases. With the recent surge in Latin crossovers, It will be surprising how much success Sting would have with a reverse crossover with real substanance."
2,Sting Should Hire a Better Translator,"The songs on the Nada Como el Sol album are basically the songs on his Nothing Like the Sun Album, but done in Spanish and Portuguese. Poorly. His pronunciation is off in places, and entire phrases are translated incorrectly. In fact, the Spanish word for the verb ""to dance"" is bailar. Not danzar. The word danzar doesn't even exist in Spanish, and yet he uses it over and over again, even as the title of a song. Sting is an excellent performer, in English. Buy the English version."
5,Nada Como Este Disco...,"First of all, I must commend Sting for his excellent pronunciations and rolling of the r's in Spanish; He sang the lyrics in two beautiful and romantic foreign languages without chopping the words or meanings like so many other English or American artists do without the proper training or knowledge of a language or dialect. He sounded very authentic !Fragilidad/ Fragil (Fragile) is such a tranquil and peaceful song. Yet, the meaning behind the lyrics are anything but.The classical guitar interprets the contents of the song beautifully; It speaks out to you. For me,personally, the song is a Sting classic !Si Estamos Juntos (We'll Be Together) is not a favorite of mine due to it's quirky late 80's pop sound.However, it serves as a counterpoint or balance to the rest of the album's melancholy and relaxed mood.Mariposa Libre, as a a previous reviewer stated, is a gem !Nada Como El Sol deserves more than 5 stars...Especially for its Spanish/Portuguese interpretations as well !"
4,Great Small Unit History...Some Complaints,"I enjoyed this book very much. Statistics for the 80th ID showed it had a nearly 200% turnover during the war due to casualties. After reading this book you'll see why. German artillery, MG fire, etc. certainly took its toll. This book adds to my feeling that company- and battalion-level histories are much, much better than regiment, division, or army histories. I have two complaints: 1) there is poor editing - numerous misspellings, missing words, etc., but that is not the author's fault - it's the publishers, and 2) there are some regrettable and very uncharitable, but perhaps understandable, comments made by the author regarding men who were back home. Not *all* of these men were ""draft dodgers,"" etc., but that is the impression given by the author."
5,A firsthand account of life and death on the front lines in the European Theater of World War II,"You Can't Get Much Closer Than This: Combat With Company H, 317th Regiment, 80th Division is a firsthand account of life and death on the front lines in the European Theater of World War II. Author A. Z. Adkins, Jr. learned the hard way that he was capable of killing and keeping his cool under fire, and earned a Bronze Star for his delivery of critical supplies to a cut- off unit in an embattled French town. When he was wounded by a German artillery shell, he began on a detailed journal of his experiences while recuperating in a hospital, which would eventually become the basis for this extraordinary memoir. An appendix filled with facts about the 80th Infantry Division and infantry organizations, as well as a glossary round out this gritty, at times depressing, yet always forthright testimony."
1,I agree with others - this DOESNT WORK,"I had a flood today (thanksgiving dishwasher clog) which was protected by this system. No alarm. I checked everything for power, dust, cobwebs, even put the sensor into water deliberately. Nothing. It just doesn't work.I'm buying other brands from amazon today to check for floods - I can't afford junk in an monitoring position for my house."
1,Flood detector doesn't work at all.,"I bought six of these detectors since I have a Visonic wireless alarm system. I have installed many other Visonic devices and all them work perfectly. I'm talking about PIR detectors, fire detectors and door/windows detectors. I was very happy with the overall performance of my system until I bough these flood detectors. Flood detector is supposed to work when water makes a ""bridge"" between the inside and outside metallic part at the end of detector. The best way that I could find that system was working in theory is with a small electric cable, if you make a bridge with the electric cable between the inside and outside parts the red led works perfectly and signal is transmitted, but it never works when you try to make this bridge with water. I feel that I lost 250 $ because as I said I bought six of these detectors and none of them work in any way with water."
1,waste your money on something else,I guess you will only need the trivial advice presented in this book if you lack any common sense or if you should not have become a principial investigator in the first place. I found this book more or less useless.
5,The Word made easy,"It is difficult for some to read the KJV, this DVD makes reading with this verson easy. If you want to listen or read along or do both, this DVD makes it easy to do so. There were details I missed when reading on my on that I caught as Stephen Johnson read to me. He has a great voice and I also like the special effects. This is a great item to add to your library and to give as a gift to new or old christians and those who are sick, elderly, don't read well, professional, any one. All will benefit from this selection."
5,"""PURE WORD NEEDS NO PROP""","It's nice to let the word of God saturate our spirit. I have loved allowing His holy word just pour into me and so have my children.Listening to the word of God also helps us to capture the ""true"" heart of God & help put spiritual things into perspective. There is no more excuse for us to say we cannot understand the word of God for now all we have to do is listen & pay attention as it unfolds consecutively before us.I have often heard people offering an uneducated guess about God's word & what is true and what is not true about God, but clearly, we cannot embark upon a theological discussion until we consume God's word & allow God's to word consume us.""With all thy getting, get an understanding"", only then can we share the truth of the gospel with everyone.Enjoy"
5,Worthy Purchase,"I have been through the Bible several times before and this is the first time I try an audio version. It's like a whole new experience to go through it once more in this new format. You hear the narrator while the text is displayed on the screen. There are several voices to 'play' the different persons in the chapters, which helps with the understanding. This item is suitable for people with busy schedules or who have problems reading."
4,What a great book if you don't have issues,"Well I thought this book great. In reading the review of the person who didn't like it, unfortunately I think they were not ready to learn from it...sounds like a few issues that need to be worked otu. The book is titled for what the terms fellow webers call themselves (and it is a way for them to relate to the book and feel like this person knows them) and as the title says ""and Those Who Love Them""...which is why the book goes so deeply into explaining chat rooms and the such. I would get the book, if only to try out some of the exercises and go from there."
2,Disappointment in every cup,"I received the DCM485 as a gift several years ago, and have been absolutely disappointed with every step of ownership. For starters, it is very difficult to program the clock and automatic timer. The unit is difficult to clean without using expensive coffeemaker cleaning solutions (which I do advocate, just not daily!), and the coffee is just so-so. The unit is not intuitive - after 4 years of use I still refer to the instructions regularly. My other big beef is that replacement water filters are not widely available, and when I called the company to order them they were backordered for over 6 months. Very frustrating. Save your money and buy a Cuisinart or Capresso."
1,stopped working in less than 9 months,"I was swayed by its great looks and the fact that it had a thermal carafe - big, big mistake. I didn't do any research, and now I'm paying for it since it is broken and I can't seem to get it to work. I had it less than 9 months. The only real positive is the removable water resevoir."
1,Don't buy this,"The coffee maker just stopped working after about a year and a month. So now i am assed out of a expensive coffe maker. It didn't pour very well either. And its out of warranty, and it just plain dosn't brew."
2,Used Coffermaker,"I purchased this coffeemaker for my boyfriend. When I opened the box you could tell that the item had already been removed. When I took the coffeemaker out, to my surprise, there were still grounds in the filter area. Needless to say I was disappointed that I received a ""used"" coffeemaker. I promptly returned the coffeemaker and purchased another at a local store."
1,This item has been recalled,I purchased this in early Dec 2005 from Starbucks. I found out in January 2006 that Delonghi recalled this model. SB's refunded my money.
2,not worth the money,"I have had this coffe maker for over one year. I am the only one in our family that can use this pot because everthing has to be lined up just so or it will overflow. The style of the lid is very annoying, you point the arrows in the right spot and it pours fine but if its off just a hair you have a mess and burning coffee on you hands! The coffe stays hot about 4 hours. I think the strength adjuster is hoax."
2,"Looks Good, Performs Badly","I bought this maker because it is the coolest looking one around. But now I have to leave a towel around it because I find coffee all over the place more often than not. Setting the carafe has to be perfect, or the coffee overflows. And it does dribble if you try to pour coffee too quickly."
3,Not Hot,"Always, Amazon sends out their products swiftly which we appreciate. The coffee maker is attractive and easy to use. If one wants coffee that is not bitter, use a filter along with the one that comes with the machine. Our only complaint is it does not make the coffee hot enough. We still have to put our cup in the microwave to bring the temperature up. We would love to find a machine that makes HOT coffee."
1,Delonghi DCM485 IS THE WORSE COFFE MACHINE!!!!,"I bought this coffee maker with out reading the reviews. Big mistake. I had ALL the problems stated by previous customers. With out going into great details. I went through three of these coffee makers in 21 months. 1st one I returned. Thought I received a defected one. #2 machine guit working after 11 months. I did the cut 6"" of cord mail $7.50 and wait 6 weeks. 3rd quit after 9 months. Now I'm with out a coffee maker again and there is nothing Deloghi can do. The one warrenty is only on the 1st coffee maker. Doing my research now. I can tell you I will never buy anything Deloghi again."
4,Good Review from Coffee Lover,"I disagree with many of the other people reviewing this coffee maker. I buy a new coffee maker about every six to nine months because I am fussy about coffee quality and features. First and foremost, this maker brews an excellent pot of coffee. And, it's stylish looks are great on the kitchen counter. It got my four stars based on coffee quality alone. Now a couple of the insignificant negatives that resulted in 4 instead of 5 stars. The time setting, and controls could be much easier to use and more user friendly. The carafe could pour better, although after a few uses I now know how to use the carafe without trashing the kitchen counters. There - that's it - two negatives, both of which after using the maker for a while, I'll get used to. The positive features, such as the removable water tank, the easy to use and clean filter holder, top access, design and the GREAT COFFEE make this a coffee maker I would reccomend to anyone."
2,spills all the time,"While the taste of the coffee is really good, no matter how we turn the top - yes there are indicators - it spills. What a waste of money. The clock and programming function is arcaic."
2,Customer Service,"When I received my coffee maker there was no instruction manual. So I went to DeLonghi web site to register and request the manual that should have come with the product. Although the web site is extensive, I found the registration difficult and when I tried to e-mail I was dismissed with a terse flippant response."
1,WARNING - Design Flaw!,"Bought this coffee maker from Starbucks because of the nice look. When it works, the coffee tastes wonderful. With no hotplate, the coffee is not as hot as I am used to, but for me the fresher flavor is worth it. The machine does have I horrible flaw, however. If the pot is not pushed back COMPLETELY, coffee will not flow into the pot and you will have a complete mess on your hands. It is a minutely subtle nudge between thinking the pot is locked in vs. locked in and hitting the no-drip trigger. As you fill the machine, there is no way to tell for sure if you have hit the trigger. Cross your fingers, have plenty of towels ready and wake up a few minutes early to clean-up and start a second pot.By the way, I have not experienced any problems with pouring as some other owners have. However, per the instructions, the lid must be unscrewed a half-turn before pouring."
4,Don't drop it,"First pot was great. Had to read book to figure how to pour carafe. Looks great in our stainless steel kitchen. We thought the removable water tank was a neat idea, no more pouring mess. Our daughter dropped the water tank on day 2. Unable to find any parts, too new. Amazon has agreed to take back and replace. Good service!"
2,"Bad Pour, Drippy spout gets more on the counter","I bought two DeLonghi DCM485s, One a gift and the other for my office. The staff complained, I took it home. The staff were right -- the caraffe is poorly designed. It won't pour efficiently without dripping down the side. If you pour slow enough to keep it from dripping you might as well brew your coffee in the cup -- I wrote the company. They thanked me for my thoughts on the need for redesign but did nothing -- I won't buy another DeLonghi item because of this and feel badly I gave one as a gift -- mine is a nice looking dust collector now."
2,"LOOKS GREAT, WORKS TERRIBLE!!!","I bought this for my wife for christmas, and so far we've had coffee ALL OVER the couter TWICE! I think we only used it about 4 times so far... It is true, read the reviews! If the pot is not sitting PERFECTLY, AND PUSHED IN, the coffee will overflow out of the top of the unit and make a HUGE MESS!!! Im about to throw this brand new unit in the garbage! I think delonghi should issue a recall on this unit."
2,Carafe leaks,"I have had two carafes for this coffee maker - the one that it came with when I bought it and the other one that was replaced by Delonghi. Both of them dribble when they pour, although the new one is a lot better because Delonghi sent me an improved one. I'm always cleaning up coffee from my counter. Save your money and buy a different coffee maker."
1,Good to Bad,"DeLonghi Esclusivo DCM485 10-Cup Thermal Carafe and Coffeemaker, Brushed Stainless SteelWe purchased our first DeLonghi DCM485 a couple years ago. Loved it. When it failed we tried to get it repaired. We found the same as others no parts for versions made in the Peoples Republic of China. We decided to buy a replacement. After looking in all the right stores we found that no one was carrying this version (Strike 1). Went to the internet and read the mixed reviews and bought it anyway (Strike 2). Received the coffe pot and immediately cleaned and set it up. First pot we had coffee and grounds all over the counter the same as the reviews (strike 3). I took changed out parts with the old coffee maker in an effort to figure out what had changed with no luck. We have contiued to try different things and have settled into cleaning up the mess every other pot of coffee. This morning we gave up and decided to buy a different brand."
1,What a mess!!,"I have had this coffee maker for about a year. When it is working properly, it does make a good cup of coffee. However, the caraffe drips coffee all over the counter when you pour coffee into a cup. My biggest complaint is that our machine somtimes just brews coffee all over the floor. You just never know when the coffee is going to end up in the carafe, and when it is going to end up all over the kitchen. This thing is junk."
1,My Experience with Amazon ShopZeus,"I purchased the Delonghi DCM485 because I had one prior and loved it. I received this item and decided that it was too expensive so I requested a return receipt. I then got an email from ShopZeus that there would possibly be a re-stocking fee. Becuase of that, I decided to keep it. I opened the box and discovered it was damaged (the top was loose and there was a plastic piece missing). I notified Shopzues it was damaged and was sending it back (I also made them aware on the return slip). When my credit was processed, $33.00 of the original $133 I paid was NOT refunded. I will NEVER order from this company again! If I could have rated it a zero, I would have. Be very aware of this when you order from Shopzeus."
1,Nice unit but does not last,"This is the second coffeemaker I've had from DeLonghi, both were the same model. This one lasted 1 1/2 years before the thermal fuse blew on the heating element, same problem with the last unit. Don't waste you're money on this."
1,Lemon,"Beautiful machine, but poorly made. Shame on DeLonghi. They had the chance to really make a nice machine here. The design is gorgeous - as is the stainless carafe. Sadly, during the first five days of having the machine and following the directions to the letter every time, we had three huge overflows. The water filter will not stay seated properly in the base of the water chamber. Finally after getting that settled and placing water chamber back into machine and turned on, the water flowed into the coffee grounds but didn't seep through the grounds, causing all the water to sit on top of the grounds then finally overflow from the machine. The machine even turned off by itself when there was still water remaining in the chamber. The coffee always ended up having grounds in it. Yuck. Returned mine after all this happened."
1,Leaks horribly even after purchasing new seal,It makes good coffee but the leaking in unforgivable. I even paid $5 plus $10 in shipping to purchase a new seal from the manufacturer. I still have to pour my coffee over the sink. Don't waste your money.
2,Mixed review,"My DeLonghi DCM 485 worked well for a year and a half, although the comments on the lid are pretty much spot on. The other day, the lid protrusion where you turn the lid broke, rendering the lid totally inoperable, so same with the coffee maker. It made pretty decent coffee and I like the carafe feature. We will see if DeLonghi or Starbucks makes good on this."
2,DeLonghi 10-Cup Coffee Maker,I thought if Starbucks sells this coffee maker it will at least make a good cup of coffee. It does make good coffee but the pouring mechanism is incredibly poorly designed. If you do not pour the coffee very slowly it leaks all over the counter top. No one in my house has mastered the art of pouring coffee from this coffee maker.
2,"carafe leaks, coffee not hot enough","Onluy had this maker for a day, but, when we pour the coffee, it spills over from the top of the carafe. Other reviews say that this won't happen if the arrows are properly aligned but, in my case, it still leaks.Also, the coffee's not hot enough. I don't put any cream in it or anything else to cool it off, and it's just not hot enought straight from the carafe.I'll be returning this to the store."
2,Beautiful coffee maker but just not hot enough,"I, like many others who have reviewed this coffee maker, bought it on a whim and was lured by its sleek exterior.Pros:Nice stainless steel design. Not too tall and fit nicely under our counters.It comes with a gold mesh filter which you may or may not want to use.It has a removable water reservoirIt has a programmable feature for those who do not have time to brew when they get up in the morningCons:My biggest issue is the heat. Its just not hot enough and I take my coffee black. Not good and it only gets worse after a couple of hours. I cannot stand constantly nuking my coffee in the morning.The design of the carafe is also annoying as you have to position the spout just so or it does not pour.Summary: Ulitmately a bad and expensive investment."
2,"Poorly made, hard to find filters",This coffee maker is poorly made and drips all over when you poor a cup. The Delonghi website does not even list accessories for it. I would not buy another Delonghi product.
5,water filter,"We are very pleased with this coffee maker, but I have a question. What is the trick to pushing the water filter holder down into place? Isn't it supposed to go all the way down? I have average-size female hands, but have trouble getting my hand down into the water reservoir. The instructions do not address this procedure. Help!"
1,This is a terrible coffee maker,"It is impossible to pour from this product without spilling coffee everywhere. While the rest of the unit is nice, pouring would seem to be essential. I purchased it as a gift for my wife - she hated it. I had to return it and go thru that hasstle. There is no excuse for an item costing this much to not have better product testing. It should be pulled off the maket as defective."
2,delonghi desad,"I love the way this appliance looks, but the coffee is not hot, the carafe' drips, and now, after only 4 months, it doesn't work at all. Disapointed."
2,No customer service,My wife and I have enjoyed this product for about a year. It makes good coffee and stays warm for hours without getting that burn taste. But about a year and 2 days after getting it it broke. Delongi's warrenty is garbage and they don't have a clue about what to do to get it fixed. So we will be buying something similar but for sure a different brand.
3,Great Tasting Coffee - Poor design,"I got this coffeemaker at Starbucks. The machine was on sale since they were not going to carry it anymore. It makes great tasting coffee, never had any problems with spills or leaks. Love the fact that you can pull out the water reservoir to fill. The water filter is great since our water is horrible tasting. Coffee is hot for drinking (I take it black) but once I transfer it to my insulated mug to take to work the temperature drops quickly. Also love that I can control the coffee strength.PROBLEM: after two weeks the machine quit on me. The buttons became stuck and there was no turning it on to make coffee. The buttons were lit so they were receiving power but were despressed in and stuck. I promptly returned the unit to Starbucks for a refund. I didn't see anyone else in these review complain about stuck buttons, so maybe mine was a fluke."
5,keeps on going,with better episodes and stories. Also a lot more is explained about Raven's past and why she's the way she is. With the return also of a old Titan enemy that they all thought was long gone. Its good to see each one of the Titans pretty much have their own episode revolving around them. I enjoyed all of them especially the 3 part season ender revolving around a prophecy of Raven being the key that brings about the destruction of the Earth. The Titans all band together to help bring the earth from this destruction and in the process come to a greater understanding of just what Raven's gone through since joining the Titans.It makes for an excellent season end episode and leaves it wide open for the following season with many possibilities. Great show that parents and kids can get into and enjoy along with everyone else.
5,Grand kids love it,I sent this to my grandson (7) and daughter (4) because they love the series. It arrived really fast and they loved it. Good to have a sure crowd pleaser as we are don't get to see them much.
1,Bad description of the content,"In the description is written that the language are English, Spanish and French. I bought this item to watch it in Spanish, but my surprise was that the Dvd has only English language. No Spanish or French. Please fix that."
5,Teen Titans GO,We all love Teen Titans at our house from the youngest to the oldest. Wish they wouldn't have cancelled the show so it's great to be able to purchase the series and watch it whenever we want. I love the humour and all the characters.
2,3370???? keep lookin,"i just recently bought the hk 3370 model reciever. even though more expensive then the previous one i had, a pioneer reciever with higher wattage, it didn't sound as powerful and the clarity was marginal. it does not have many options and it is built in korea; where as the more expensive hks are built else where. furthermore just months after i bought my 3370, it quit working. it still turns on however no sound is output anymore. ive checked for a fuse insert and if there is actually one it must be internal because ive never found it. i do recommend ""hk"" products and have had past experience with them before, i just wouldnt recommend this one. go for the ""avr"" series and not the ""hk"" ones. (there is a price difference but remember this is in fact the cheapest reciever hk offers.)"
5,"Product as advertised, shipped quickly with accessories","Again the product was just what I wanted, included accessories with it, and shipped quickly. Due to my error on not checking last time before clicking order, the product was ordereded twice. I quickly returned the extra product and was credited for it with no hassle."
4,Beautiful camera holder,This case is as advertised. It is beautiful and smart looking. The only down side is I would like to have the strap be longer so it could fit over your shoulder.
2,Very small case,"This is a nice looking brown suede camera case. Based on all the Stylus models listed, I assumed my Olympic Stylus 595 would fit in it but, unfortunately, it does not."
4,Keep on Boppin',"If you are unfamiliar with Big Sandy, this is as good an album to begin with as any, solid tracks ready to provide the beat for your next house dance party. Those well versed in Big Sandy's medium will find no surprises here-another solid effort in the west coast rockabilly/country sounds for which he is known."
5,genev,"This book deserves serious consideration; Shaw details and then comments on each of the sections of the Westminster Confession of Faith (which is one of the greatest creeds ever produced by man). This entry is a ""keeper"" which must not be read only once, but kept close as an excellent reference to accurate rendering of biblical theology."
1,Not worth it!!,"This book is not really helpful to the average first year medical student trying to get by. It consists of lots of silly activities that you don't even have time to think about as a first year. I had to dig through this book to find anything interesting or useful about coping in medical school. It is not a practical book. If you really want help coping in medical school, take a few nights off a week and go out with friends! The book by the princeton review is much more interesting."
3,"Easy listening, instrumental collection of Burt's tunes.","I had wanted a collection of Burt's best tunes, as sung by the original singers, but I couldn't find any. So, I settled for this CD. Not too bad a collection of mostly instrumental pieces as orchestrated by Burt, with some help from anonymous background vocalists. Burt also sings in a couple of songs - well, he tries to. We all know why he stuck to song-writing.This CD will not be the most satisfying collection for Burt's fans. It is good for the uninitiated and for those, who like me, would like some unintrusive late-night music from a great song-writer."
4,Really enjoyed the album.,"My husband almost collapsed when he opened the package that had just arrived from Amazon.com. "" Burt Bacharach?"" I grew up on Burt Bacharach. My Mom & Dad were always playing his music and singing his songs. They are songs that you find yourself humming and somehow always know the words. The musical arrangements are wonderful and I am truly glad Mr. Bacharach is receiving the recognition he deserves. As a little kid I enjoyed his music and now again as an adult."
1,This is a really bad movie,"I cannot beleive that the reviews for this movie are positive. This movie is a low budget piece of garbage. The acting is horrific, that lead role, where did they find that guy. The Hawaiian friends act retarded half the time, these guys are supposed to be in their late teens, they act like their 10. Besides the lack of any acting the story sucks too. Who the hell compared this to Once Were Warriors, what a joke. The only purpose of this film seems to be a movie attempting to show how badass Hawaiians are supposed to be, which I have to say it's not very impressive.This movie sucks and if it truly is a reflection on Hawaii, then my opinion of Hawaiians is that their goofy little kids. I actually own this movie and I put it on for a laugh, mainly watching that main character, where did they find that guy, simply hilarious."
2,Rubbish,"What a load of rubbish. Lousy acting. Poor story. Minimal surfing action. Unbelieveable storyline. White dude turns up in Hawaii to live. Immediately gets picked on by the ""native"" Hawaiians because he's different. Suddenly gets on well with some of the natives who takes him into their confidence. Of course then comes the inevitable meeting of the native chick, who just happens to be a relative of one of the good guys. And of course he gets to save one of her brothers which indears him even more to her. What garbage!!"
1,"Good artwork, iffy text","If I wanted a coffee table book, I would have bought a coffee table book. Too much fluff and not enough good stuff. The basics are too basic and the images are too hard to duplicate."
2,Not a good book,This book is not very good - it lacks explanations and skips out on a lot of important topics. Also it is not very well organized and it is confusing.
2,Needs more details,"This is a pretty book, hence the additional star. Some great artwork. Too bad I can't figure out how to make it myself."
1,Not gluten free,"I feel bad giving the one star rating as this may be a good product for someone who is not gluten free, however, Amazon sells them in the ""gluten free store"" and they are not, in fact, gluten free, only wheat free. They have oat flour as a top ingredient and it is not certified gluten free oat flour so, if your little one is gluten free, they cannot eat any product made by this company because, though many of them are wheat free, they still contain or possibly contain gluten. FYI, Envirokidz makes a gluten free, organic vanilla cookie that works well for toddlers."
1,Choking hazard,I don't normally write reviews but am going to contact the company today but thought I would see if anyone else had issues with these buiscuits. My 8 month old son keeps bitting off the end of the buiscuit - about the size of a quarter - within less than 5 minutes of starting to nibble. I have had to retrieve the not-so-little piece twice now - won't ever give him another one.
4,Metric placemat,"This is a wonderful placemat. Even my adult sisters are re-learning from it. As a placemat, it won't get ripped or dirty as easily. It's also eye catching and causes good meal time conversation."
2,Disappointed,I bought these to replace my (lost)Shure Quietspot. I have been disappointed in the sound quality. Those listening to me complain about the ambient noise.The Shure Quietspot were superior in all ways.
1,Poor,"Callers on the other end could not hear me, I returned it. Would not recommend. Voice clarity was amazing...but I was not impressed with everything else."
2,poor volume,I spend several hours a day on the phone for business. These were reviewed well however clients were unable to hear me even with the mike in my mouth. They do fit well in the ear.
3,acceptabe,some people say that i sound clear others complain. so i would say that it wasnt what i expected. no better that than 7 8 dollar units
1,Did not work for me,"Based on the majority of positive reviews of the ER22C I expected to have crystal clear sound quality with some comfort trade off because of the ear piece design.In reality, I was almost right about the ear piece. Almost being the degree of discomfort with that thing jammed in my ear made for short and infrequent calls. As for the crystal clear sound quality that never happened.... not once. Maybe my expectations were too high but I sent mine back and picked the ear bud that came with my iPhone which is comfortable and works fine."
1,Save your money,A friend recommended the etymotic research ER22C headset to me. I thought my Motorola bluetooth headset could be improved upon so I bought this in the hopes that the noise canceling qualities would be better. WRONG. People have a lot of trouble hearing me unless I hold the mike right by my mouth. The sound is tinny. The headset is incredibly uncomfortable and will not stay in the proper position for the mike unless it is held in place. Absolutely the worst headset I have every used. That's $35 I'd like to have back!
2,"good brand, marginal product","I have enjjoyed other etymotics products, but this one was rather cheap upon opening. In addition, most new cell phones come with blue tooth devices, and no plug for the etymotics device. Think hard about buying this, the I-pod phones are excellent"
1,don't bother,"After using many other in ear headsets, this is the worst. I can hardly hear the other person and they can hardly hear me. It really doesn't need noise cancellation because you can't hear anything anyhow. I am now using a cheap $8 earset that blows this away. I expected far better quality from such a high end maker of headphones..."
1,Does not work with iphone,"I purchased this for my iphone. I also purchased an adapter. The call sounded clear and great to me but the people I spoke with complained of an echo. When I disconnected the headset, their echo went away. Following others advice, I tried a few different adapters with varying results, none good. One adapter made me sound as if I was on speaker phone and was difficult to hear. Further, Etymotic doesn't sell or even recommend an adapter.I would advise to just avoid purchasing it in the first place. Why bother trying to find the right adapter? Unfortunately for me, I chose to keep trying different adapters and missed my window of opportunity to return the product. So shame on me, now I'm stuck with it."
5,Superb for extremely noisy environments,"I struggled for years to find a headset that would work in extremely noisy environments. I am regularly in areas that are 90db and above.Once I found this headset I was amazed at the noise cancelling ability of the boom mike. People could hear me speak above the background noise without my going hoarse from shouting, and I could hear them well.The headphone takes some getting used to as it is ""in-ear"" and fits snugly in the ear canal. If you have sensitive ears, this probably won't be for you.The only drawback: it doesn't work with iPhones as supplied. You will need an adapter. I just orderedthe Headset Buddy 2.5mm to 3.5mm smartphone adapterand it works wonderfully"
5,The best Cellular Headset I have ever used!,This is The best Cellular Headset I have ever used!The sound quality is fantastic.People I speak with often say they can't tell I am using a cell phone even when I am outdoors in the wind.The only thing I could wish for would be a wireless Bluetooth version.
4,Good headset,"I bought this because of my previous experience with Etymotic earphones. The sound quality is great on both ends. The reason I gave it 4 stars is I think the cord is a little short, and because I use the orange foam ear tips it takes a few seconds to get it in my ear."
4,Not all plug adapters work with this headset and the iPhone 4,"Not all plug adapters for the iPhone 4 work with this headset!The Apple TTY Headset adapter DOES NOT WORK.The adapter recommended here on Amazon DOES NOT WORK.The only adapter that works for me was the ""2.5 mm TRS headset to iPhone adapter - 3.5mm 4 conductor TRRS Male to 2.5mm TRS Female"" adapter from kV Connection. The model number is KM-IPHONE-25F.This is specific to the Apple iPhone 4 and the ETY-COM headset. The other adapters actually work fine with an iPad 2. I took me a long time (and money) to figure this out... but at least I got it to work! If you find another adapter that works, please post it here as well."

5,amazing tiramisu,Tiramisu is my favorite thing in the whole world! I ordered this from Ditalia & it is amazing! it is very moist with great flavor and tastes like something you would get in a restaurant! for the price the taste is well worth it! I would order a few to keep on hand for a quick desert when people visit! great great product!
4,delightfully surprised,"For the amount of money spent on this product I really feel like I got a good value. The tiramisu was surprisingly good. rich, flavorful, and moist. I most definitely be interested in repeat business and recommend this product to all of my friends. Thanks D'Italia!"
3,"Good cross reference, but no specifications included","While this reference is great for finding replacement part numbers, there is no information about maximum current levels, break down voltages, etc. I would like to use a part number to find information on the specs, but so far I don't see a book like that."
3,"Beware, does not take larger bits","After setting up one of these router tables, I discovered that it would not take a bit larger than 1 5/8"". Since I had purchased the table to make custom frames with tongue and groove bits, the table had to be disassembled and returned. Unfortunately, Skil does not list the limit on bit size on the box, and you can only find this information in a footnote about the supplied inserts well into the manual. Since I didn't actually use the table I can not comment on other concerns."
2,Not for beginners !!!!,Skil makes better products than this table!It was awsome on 1st try I thought wow! Then i used it more! Trust me spend a little more $$ on a table cuz you will end up getting a better table in the end! Most of the problem with this table is the fence system! Watch your fingers hold on tight!Also make sure you you mount the table by holes in the bottom of the table's leg's.
4,Not bad for the money,Well like with most tools you buy you pretty much get what you pay for. I know a pro router table runs about 400-700 so for 75 bucks it was good. It does take some leveling and things like that to get it set up right. Also when you set the fence you have to level it with a level. My project was pretty simple I was building drawer boxes and needed a router table to cut a groove in the sides for the bottom panel of the drawer to fit in. It worked great! I also did some simple rounding on it aswell so if you have a fairly simple project like I did and dont want to spend huge bucks on something you dont need this is the one for you. Have a good one guys
1,"Poorly Built, Waste of Money","I bought this Router Table and I was expecting it to be a very easy to use since it's small and the one I bought came with a straight fit Router which on Christmas was on sale both for $100, the assembling was not very very difficult but to learn how to use it was a nightmare. I even gave the router to a contractor who did some work on my house and asked him to show me how to make it work or at least control the level of router which is the biggest worry for router users, the contractor couldn't adjust the level and said it's a junk. Be careful the other review is 100% correct this table is very dangerous, the plastic cover hit the router bit once and almost hit me, after this incident I decided to put it back and return it , i usually hate to return items but as long as I see this item in my house I feel that they scammed me with an item that I couldn't use even once."
4,SKIL RAS450 Benchtop Router Table.,I am very pleased with this purchase. It is exactly as stated in the product info and has everything needed. The price was the best I have found any where. Thanks Amazon.com
4,"CPE strong, JSB good","This is a fine recording by a wonderful group. The CPE Bach Magnificat is energetic and exciting, probably the best recording of this interesting work currently available. The sound is a bit echoy but I adjusted. A recommended recording."
2,Not a good choice for beginners,"I bought this CD on Amazon's recommendation, as part of their ""Get Started in Classical"" area. It's a full CD of choral work, lots of singing and very little purely instrumental work. I chose Bach because I associate him with a very fluid and relaxing style; this was just jarring, 60 minutes of operatic style ""classical."" You have been warned."
5,Another JT gem.,"James Taylor has consistently put out excellent albums during his career, and this one does not disappoint either. It has the musical intricacy of Hourglass, with a somewhat more upbeat score - a great combination. Wish it had been out all summer! The vocal, writing, and guitar talents of JT and Mark Knopfler are amazing on Sailing to Philadelphia, available on the bonus cd. Highly recommended."
3,carbon paper,"As a long time fan, I eagerly awaited JT's latest. And I felt disappointed when it arrived.James has created some beautiful songs on this album, my favorites being ""September Grass"" and ""Caroline I see you,"" but there is nothing new here. Its the same, beautiful sounding JT, without anything different. Its as though James looked at Hourglass and said, 'how can I replicate its success.' Similar song tones, sounds, and song order. If anything, its a bit more self-indulgent, like the 1 minute 24 second musical intro to Caroline I see You. Many of the songs sound like other JT favorites, with similar chord changes and intros.James has done better, more interesting work. I would have really loved to hear some of the impact of the past year in this album, but instead, James took the easy road. I will still listen to this cd every now and then, but its not a must have."
5,Only JT can put his music to words! Welcome home.,"Like a cherished friend stopping by for a long weekend of all night long coffee talk and cozy memories, 'October Road' makes you feel like you have known James your entire life. His songs touch moments of time and feelings long since misplaced. Once again he hasn't let us down and this album was well worth the wait. The limited ed. version has a second cd of favorite James Taylor tunes with a more grown up feel and musical expression. Get snuggled in with a warm beverage, let the moonlight in the windows and let him touch your heart and take you away to 'October Road'."
1,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE printer!!!,"I will never buy another Epson printer as long as I live. The printer has a mind of it's own and tells you when it's ""out of ink"" even when the ink cartridge is half-full and won't let you print anything else until you replace it... and the ink cartridges are EXPENSIVE!If that weren't bad enough, our printer flat out STOPPED WORKING after 18 months of use!!! It STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRINT JOB and gave an error message telling us that the parts in the printer were at the end of their service life, even though the pages from the first half of the print job looked fine. It will not print anything else until we replace the dumb parts. IF YOU BUY THIS PRINTER, YOU WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ANF NOT GET VERY MUCH USE OUT OF IT!SOOOOO NOT WORTH IT!!!I honestly would not accept another Epson printer if they PAID me to!"
1,Big Disappointment,"If you expect documentation and/or support with your printer, keep looking. Particularly for Mac users this is not recommended. All drivers and dialog boxes are Windows-like, non-intuitive and the documentation is horrific. What documentation exists is focused on printing from camera, duplicating photos,etc. Hello, I want to print from my computer! When I can get it to print, quality is uneven. I'm returning mine."
4,this printer is wonderful,"ive purchased this printer a year and half ago. i was alittle bit surprised of the size at first. i am a nursing student and i needed a printer to seriously take a beating. i had to printer out over 300 pages for 1st semester. i didn't have a problem, and then i printed out 10 photos. i was very pleased with the quality of the printing. um the only prob i have is that the paper would get jammed and i have to turn the printer on and off. i still love this printer, definitely less expensive then hp."
3,clear colored photo prints but costly bLK & white copier for text only..,"The printer would have been a 5 (for good color prints) , if only the blk & white copier for copying text materials only, is doing its main job.Though the printer is set up on ""Text"" and not on ""Photo"" option, hitting the 'Blk & White"" button will still copy your TEXT material in the PHOTO type !( wonder if this is an error on epson's part). Copying a Text in Photo type entails more ink usage since even the slightest hue of the template paper is taken or copied. And if you copy from a smaller paper size with a blank background around, it will copy the solid black background per se which certainly DRAIN a 3rd of your black ink ! I have to set up my old simpler black & white copier now, for copying text only."
2,Unhappy with Epson service,"I purchased the Epson Stylus Photo RX620 in July 2006. After running less than 200 copies the machine had ink all over the inside and on the paper feeder.Epson replaced this unit with a new unit. Trying to run 20 copies this unit also sprayed ink all over the inside of the unit and paper in the feeder.Epson replaced this unit with a ""refurbished"" unit which when unpacked had loose parts from the paper feeder. Unit was shipped without locking the scanner or installing the paper feeder properly.I purchased a new unit and two months later a had a used ""refurbished"" unit that would not feed paper.Not happy one bit with Epson Customer Service -- Jack"
2,Espon RX620 could be better,"I would not recommend this printer to anyone considering buying a new or used one. I have gone through color cartidges quickly and switching to black ink also slowly drains the other color cartridges as well. It does print nicely on paper and photo, but there has to be something out there that does not hit your pocket hard for ink replacements. And now wireless is the way to go as well. It did nicely scan old photo negatives from my parents days into my computer. The real reason I bought the printer several years ago."
2,had some trouble,"When I tried to copy something on this printer, say it was a black and white image with a lot of plain paper around it, the printer would print the image fine but would also spend a lot of time printing a slight tone behind it of the 'paper color'. This seemed like a big waste of time and ink so I called epson ( and i must say that they have a pretty good tech support) and they said that this was a hardware problem and they sent me a new one. I recieved the new one and it wouldn't print at all and made a horrible noise when I tried to do a head cleaning. So now am sending this one back too....Its too bad, it seems like a nice printer otherwise!"
2,Good Images - Terrible Inks,"after only a short period of time, I began running out of colored inks (magenta, cyan, etc.) I changed my printer settings to 'print black ink only'. this slowed the color ink drainage down, but did NOT stop it. even printing black ink only YOUR COLORED INKS WILL RUN OUT.also, the printer will not print at all (including 'black ink only') if ANY of the inks are empty. (even if they aren't going to be used.)you will find this terribly annoying. and at 12 dollars a cartridge, you will soon feel cheated."
2,"Get Scanner Error 80% of the time, and paper feed doesn't always work","I'm not happy with this AIO. Out of the box I've had problems with the scanner. Also sometimes the paper doesn't feed but the printer prints anyway... a waste of expensive ink!The software to print photos is fine if you want one per page but if you do two or more it leaves a lot of white space on the page and I haven't figured out how to fix that.I also purchased this to scan negatives but haven't had the time and patientence to try it :(.I gave it two stars, the pictures I have managed to get out are good and I have scanned photos in and they have come out very nice."
1,CAUTION! Do not buy this or any other Espon printer!,"This is the poorest consumer product I have ever wasted my money on. Every aspect of printing with this machne and of Epson's so-called ""support"" has caused me more frustration than anything else I have ever owned. The photo quality is mediocre. Finally, 5 weeks after I bought it, a paper misfeed destroyed it and now I am happily (except for the hundreds of dollars wasted on it and the ink) tossing it into the garbage. Never again Epson."
1,negative scanning is horrible to non-existant,"The negative scanner will chop photos randomly, if it scans them at all. Usually it won't recognize that there is anything on the scanner at all and when switched to normal mode it scans part of the negative tray...lovely. I had some of these same issues with an Epson flatbed/negative scanner years ago, seems like they're sending out the same crappy and bugged software. I think this will be the last Epson product I own."
3,Has some great features but needs to make the overall quality work better,"I have now had my Epson Stylus Rx620 for about four months and have used all features.Pros: can print pictures from some slides (see cons for explanation), great customer service, great print outs of photos from memory cards or computer on EPSON photo paper (which is pricey). Ink has individual cartridges (which can be refilled with a chip resetter to cut down on costs- not that this is recommended by the manufacturer but I am all for cutting costs if it does not effect the quality) It has done a wonderful job of printing copies of photos. Overall I have been pleased with the printer, (mostly for printing photos- its best quality)"
1,Won't buy an Espon Again!,"This is my third RX620. My first two LCD panels went out while it was still under warranty thank goodness. It was a very painful experience at the time but now I am having new and more frustrating problems. I would have to say that I was mostly pleased with the prints with my PC but I have switched over to a Mac and now my prints are just plain junk. I have updated drivers, new calibration for my monitor, I can even print out of the epson printing software that they send with the software bundle and I still get dark muddy prints. I have tried different profiles, messed with the driver settings and tried every little suggestion online from others like me. There are many other people out there like me. Just do a few searches and you will see."
3,Rethink,"The original purchase referb was a dud and did not work at all! Epson sent a replacement, and it seems to work OK, but have not done any scanning yet. This is my husband's printer, so I have had just a little experience with it."
2,Epson RX620 Evaluation,"Color prints from E mail or web pages are great, vivid and bright. However, it is extremely slow to print (ads claim up to 18ppm) The copy function sucks, on copy function; poor quality copies taking up to 2 minutes, the scan is fast but requires going into Applications and starting Epson Scan every time then to print out is forever."
1,Unhappy with negative and slide scans,"I just bought this printer/scanner today and I am very unhappy with the negative/slide scan capability. The scanner does not scan the entire negative nor the entire slide! When comparing a print from a scanned negative with a store-produced print, the right most 1/2 inch of the print is simply not there. Same deal with the slide. So this printer/scanner is being returned! I am now searching for a scanner that will actually scan the entire slide and negative."
1,A message from the future,"Today's date is Jun 7, 2006 but I will pretend I am writing this review in Jun 2007. If you read the reviews of any epson printer product made in the past 4 years you will know that they clog, so as I am writting this review in 2007 my once well rounded epson rx620 inks heads have clogged. I am out of the warranty period. I cannot find a 800 number for epson. They have told me that I need to run a head cleaning, so I go out and buy some inks for 60 dollars, then I run the cleaning and still nothing happens, the printer still prints out blank pages. They say to run it again and again which I do. They have told me I need to purchase a new one (they offer me a discount off 10 dollars of their latest one) or have this one repaired. PEOPLE..... DO NOT BUY EPSON PRINTERS learn your lesson!"
2,Not so hot,I bought the RX620 when it was new just out two years ago and they were still playing ink cartridge games. I don't like the fact that you can't print if one of the cartridges is low....I don't like the fact that it often can't separate pages so it upchucks several...I don't like the fact that the price is about half what it was then....I don't like the fact that Epson support doesn't....I don't like the fact that I now have a message that no one apparently can explain about parts reaching the end of their useful life (after less than 2 years) and have to be replaced....I don't like the poor quality of the negative and slide scanning (which is why I bought it)--otherwise it's fine.
1,Unsustainable ink usage,I've been pleased with the scanning and print quality of my Epson and I like the built-n card reader but ink usage is atrocious and environmentally unsustainable.As other reviewers have noted the machine will insist on replacing ink cartridges that clearly have ink remaining in them (you can hear it sloshing around when you shake them). If you remove a cartridge to check it and then replace it the machine will reject it and insist it too be replaced. What a rort!
1,"don't buy, stupid features and requirements","This is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy. I usually have high tolerances for non-perfect equipment but this is going way too far.My biggest complaint? YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT ALL INKS BEING AVAILABLE! This doesn't sound bad initially since its a printer and all but realize this means you can't print in B&W; only if you're out of color. You can't print only in blues if the red is out. You can't do anything.Once even one of the ink cartridges are out, you basically do not have a printer anymore. Even the damn scanner/copier won't work without color cartridges. Its the dumbest feature ever."
1,Not what I really wanted,"I thought that the book would be in pretty good condition, but in reality, if I had an opportunity to see the book before I clicked ""buy"", I would not have paid for it. I'm glad that I got a copy of it in the time frame that I wanted, but I fear, because I would like to have a copy in better condition, that I will have to buy another copy of the book. My loss, I suppose."
3,legendary outlaws,it is getting a bit old now but i think in its day it was probably a popular moviethere is a reasonably good story behind it
4,Latimore's obscure but soul-soothing Malaco debut set.,"Originally released in 1982, this (somewhat) obscure album was Latimore's Malaco debut. Latimore's husky and smoky yet vibrant and heartfelt vocals are truly in peak form on the slow-burn Soul-Blues ballads which are predominant on this CD. As was the case with most Malaco albums of the 1980s, this one was sparsely produced and most of the songs were (obviously) aimed at serious Southern R&B fans--not surprisingly, it failed to get any considerable amount of radio airplay. This is music that soothes the soul, however, and an album well worth checking out."
5,"""Souvenir China"" Brought to Life through Book",This handy paperback volume is a true gem on collecting late 19th/early 20th century souvenir china. The numerous color photos and informative text make this an excellent addition to any collector's bookshelf. Highlights include wholesaler marks and information on manufacturers.This edition promises to be the corner stone for the souvenir china collector!
5,Brain Buster,"For those who consider themselves to be analytical, this book will teach you why your pool shot missed. These tips can also be applied to other areas of life."
5,pleasures nof small motions,"an excellent, excellent book on the mental side of the game. there is so much to the mental side a lot of people just don't realize how much. so if you want to play better(and who doesn't) this is for sure the right book for you!"
5,"I wrote it, so of course I like it!","I began playing pool in early middle age, after I'd been practicing psychotherapy for several years. Since understanding the mind is my profession, I began studying pool psychology. Nothing available made any scientific sense--we know enough about the mind to know that the conventional wisdom about ""the mental game"" is just wrong. Minds don't work like that.So I began trying to figure it out on my own, using my knowledge of the best current science. ""Pleasures of Small Motions"" is the result.If you want gimmicks, don't buy this book. If you want hocus-pocus or psychobabble, don't buy this book. However, if you want a scientifically sound understanding of the mental game, have a look."
1,I rate it lousy...,"The whole book was spent trying to explain a concept...duh, as if we didn't get it the first time. It is a well known concept that is used in many areas of skill and was nothing new. The explanations weren't even good. I tossed it."
5,"Finds safe, clean, cheap sleeps quick!","I picked this up at the library before a long driving trip with my family. When we're only going to be in a place for 8hrs to sleep, we don't care about character, we just want clean & safe. We'd rather save our money for the places with character on the days we're spending longer than 8 hrs.It was so nice to have a listing of not only cheap hotels (which could be found anywhere - there's always a Motel 6 nearby), but ones which are clean & safe. We were able to decide what town to stop in & where to call in advance, and the book delivered.It could have been longer, but then it would be ... longer. And on a 3-wk car trip, we didn't need a Yellow Pages sized book to tote along."
4,Awakenings plus more,"I work for a Fortune 10 company and the pressure can be intense but taking time to refresh by listening to Kevin Asbjornson CD's always brings me back to a better place. If you want to take your mind to the crisp, clear, mountain hour of Colorado Springs enjoy any of Kevin's albums...each new album enhances the experience all the more."
5,Soulfood!!!,"This music is simply awesome. Great training music, cardio and resistance.Have nearly every Soulfood release - all keepers. Dissapointed at first about the number of ""remix"" cuts on some Soulfood discs - thought they would be repetitive rip-offs - not so. Remixes are different enough to be another whole take on the musical concept. Soulfood is red hot - can not say enough good about their music. I think the keystone of the widely varied Soulfood releases is DJ Free... someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Check six."
2,"Good music, but not what I expected.","I was looking for a CD to use in my yoga class. After listening to the sample snippets, I determined that it would be appropriate. However, when I played it, the music was not as soothing as I had thought - too much voice and guitar. This music actually reminds me of Enigma's 1990 release of ""Mea Culpa."""
3,TREE HOUSE JOURNALS FROM AN IRISH FAN,"THE STANDOUT TRACKS FOR ME ARE "" YOU AND ME BABE & THE SADEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD"". POSSIBLE NOT AS GOOD AS ""SONGS FOR GROWNUPS"" BUT STILL TYPICAL FRIEDMAN. THIS ALBUM WAS FINANCED BY HIS FANS (INCLUDING MYSELF) AND GIVES DEAN THE SCOPE TO DO HIS OWN THING WITHOUT THE RECORD COMPANY BUTTING IN. IF YOU LIKE FRIEDMANS LOOK AT LIFE, THIS IS A MUST & DON'T FORGET HE IS PROMISING ANOTHER ALBUM NEXT YEAR...."
3,Adorable but not great,"I used this to line the dresser drawers in my son's nursery. It looked SO CUTE and was perfect for a boy's room. However, despite being difficult to apply due to stickiness, within a couple of days it had peeled up at the corners in most of the drawers. I've kept it in there and am working with it for now. But when it needs to be replaced, I found a roll of green plaid at WM for 1/4 the price that will be a little less cute but a lot less expensive. In short, it's too expensive for what you get (although the seller did discount the shipping when I bought multiple rolls)."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY>>This could be a scam,"I've been looking at personal speakers for my Discman and have been looking at a few. This is labeled as a 10watt, 60 dollar speaker system. It however seems to be the exact same speakers that goodguys and many other places are selling for around 30 dollars with an output of 3 WATTS. They look identical, so I though maybe it was just same packaging but different quality. But the model numbers are identical... SRSA37...I could easily be wrong, but it seems like these speakers are falsely labeled in order to sell at a higher price. I have yet to find a 10 watt - battery powered speaker set advertised ANYWHERE else - so I guess just buyer beware!! Do some research before purchasing"
5,Nadas - Tranceiver,"Great album, first heard some of it on ""Pinks"" on Speedchannel.Nice guitar work. I think these guys would be great live as there is no high tech garbage, just good tunes performed well."
1,HORRIBLE -,"Larry King tells nice recollections from his childhood about the game, and the book did capture my interest, but as I read I notices a plethora of mistakes, inaccuracies, and errors. It seems that a proofreader did not check many of the facts that Larry King recalls. It got to be somewhat comical as I read finding one mistake after the next. It's also very repetitive - and littered with phrases like, ""Can you tell I like baseball,"" ""Can you tell I love uniforms,"" and the like.As I read this, I had the feeling that Larry just spoke about baseball into a tape recorder and the words were made into a hastily written book.I expected much better."
3,Silver Dust,When I added this to the cake it was so beautiful that I couldn't believe it! Even the customer was impressed! It made the cake look more professional for someone who's still learning to make beautiful cakes.
4,Good,"I ordered this for my brother's 30th Birthday cake and having never used anything like it before I was a bit clumsy with it. There isn't much, but it goes a long way. It covered the chocolate genache great and it looked very cool-as did my entire kithen for a week because it gets everywhere...proceed with caution in the kitchen."
3,very small amount for the price,I think I could have gotten this at Roberts or even Hobby Lobby and would have been cheaper. Not worth the shipping cost for such a small amount of product
3,Iran,This book was good because there were drawn pictures which illsutrated ancient Iran's army uniform. There were some artifacts that what appeared to be Iranian women were engaing in battle field.
4,Nicole In Flight,"this book is realy very intresting,every plot is differently handled. i love to read this book."
3,HVAC Systems Design Handbook Review,"As a newcomer to the HVAC industry I found the book to very informative...it was presented in such a way, however, that makes it very hard to read. SMACNA puts out a few manuals that are less ""dry"" and a lot easier to read. I would recommend that anyone who is interested in this publication to have some general knowledge of the HVAC industry in order to make understanding this book easier."
2,Disapointment,"This book is aimed at the engineering design professional but I found it to be a major disapointment. There are a number of good texts available on this subject but this one, like so many of Roger Haines' other books, is a superficial overview with little if any practical information."
2,Not as expected.,"I found this book informative rather than practical as implemented by publisher to be a working tool primarily for desingers. People with basic knowlege of HVAC might enjoy reading this book to get some general but not in-depth engineering knowlege of HVAC systems, but there is not much for designers who need analytical information and knowledge of calculation procedures."
1,this book is not good for refrigeration Engineer,"I bought this HVAC system Design handbook, but I think this is not fit for me, it did not introduce the AC part and air conditioner system design in this book, should be improve in the future."
5,Gardening and more!,"If you would like to produce a vigorous garden, then this is the book for you!Tells so much more than just garden tips! Wish there was a kindle calender with all the phases for the year to go with it!"
5,Control you life,"This is a fantastic book. Its comprehensive and to the point, and exactly what I was looking for. If you would like to improve your ""luck"", become a wonderful gardener and control other aspects of your life, this book is for you. Worth every penny. I loved it."
3,Superstition or practical advice?,"Do you ever wonder what and why and how almanac gardening is, or is potentially useful, or if it works? Do you imagine it's all a pack of superstitious cockypop like those long range weather forecasts or newspaper horoscopes? Well, as that very eminent astrophysicist, whose name evades me at the moment, once intoned, ""If plants are not affected by the movement of celestial bodies and the interplay of quantum gravity, they are the only things in the universe that evade it."" That said, it appears highly questionable whether anyone has made coherent sense of such effects. This book offers one approach, and whether or not the authors are correct in any of their offerings, their suggested organization of garden chores does ensure that everything necessary will get done over the course of the months and seasons. So if you want to get a handle on almanac gardening, and neatly organize your garden year to boot, check this one out."
4,Great for the price,"I bought these mainly for the warranty, as I've used many good headphones that would just quit shortly after the warrant period. A lifetime warranty is very helpful.As for the headphones themselves, they surpassed my expectations for a forty dollar set. I was really impressed by the sound isolation. I'm taking these to college dorms, where sound echos like crazy, and these headphones muffle up the environment noise quite a bit.The fit is about average. I could feel it pressing against my head, but the ear cups were very large and ample for my ears.The sound is above average. It's not the best ever, but it's definitely good for the price paid. This is NOT for bass enthusiasts. The bass is pretty non existent compared to DJ headphones. But I listen to a lot of vocals, and they come through pretty clearly.Overall, I'd recommend these to anyone who doesn't need bass. I took off one star just for the bass, but really I'd give it four and a half, since bass isn't too important to me."
1,Utterly bassless,"I purchased these based on my previous experience with Koss products, but these headphones border on worthless, and will dissuade me from ever even trying Koss again.They certainly do reduce external noise, but I attribute that to how they clamp onto my head like a vise -- so I can't wear them for very long in a sitting.But that's fine, because they sound so tinny and are so lacking in bass response that I grow irritated with the poor sound reproduction well before the pressure on my head and upper jaw starts to ache too much.Bought them as a gift for my daughter and was so embarrassed by them that I promptly overnighted a superior pair of Sony Extra Bass phones to compensate for the poor quality of this Koss unit."
1,Don't waste your money,"These headphones are AWFUL. Yes, the construction is excellent and they are quite comfortable considering they're girth, but the bass is NON-EXISTENT. I tried them out right out of the box with my iPod, first with some Public Enemy and then some Guns n' Roses. They failed both tests epically. I didn't even bother to run them through some classical or jazz, since, even at high volume (both on the headphones themselves and my iPod/laptop) there was an abysmal response. Don't waste your time. I'm returning them right after submitting this review."
4,Excellent for listening to narration,"The Koss QZ-99 is a very nice product, for certain things. I would never recommend this type of product, without knowing the context. I use it for listening to books on tape, on the street or in a gym, on an old portable tape player. Since I am just listening to narration, I care much more about outside sound being blocked out than I care about sound quality. If you use Bose headphones in this context, you are going to get much better sound, but that is a drawback: you will hear the crackles and rattles and pops on the your 8 year old Walkman and the 5 year old library book-on-tape. Noise reducing headphones can be too good. If I were listening to classical music on a CD player, in an airplane, a higher quality, and/or active noise reducing product would be better. But for my situation the Koss is very nice. I did not realize, until recently, that I could swivel the ear pads as well a lengthen and shorten the band between the pads. It works very well."
3,They work(ed) great - PART II,"I used them daily for two weeks before one ear started shorting out, that ear completely went blank after four weeks. They sure did work great those first 10 days or so.They look tough but I doubt they could handle a weekend at NASCAR, for which I bought them for. I was using them for music and radio when they shorted out on me.However, the warranty on them says ""Lifetime, No Questions Asked!"" ...So I will check that out, send them in, and see what happens. If Koss can get them back to me in a quick turnaround, I'll knock my rating back up to a 3.BWI sent them in to the company and got an extremely quick turn-around, back and working good. Next test - NASCAR.B."
2,impressive performance but.....,had to order two more since two of them quit working. I originally ordered two but they quit working after awhile.
3,Does not employ active noise reduction circuitry,"These will stop much background noise, but only because they are large and completly smother the ears. They stop so much sound that they are dangerous to use. Active noise reduction circuitry reduces the background noise while not inhibiting the safety of the wearer.These are actually huge in comparison to a smaller set of phones that employ noise reduction circuitry.I replaced these with iGo 48001960 City Active Noise Canceling Hedphones, Brown/Gold. They fold up neatly, are much smaller and more compatable with airplane travel."
4,"very solid, sound blocking very effective","bought it 2 wks ago.I'm a musician; it's perfect to practice drum and play along a track or metronom cos it blocks the exterior sound quite effectively. Amazing in the streets/ transport, don't need to push up volume.Quality in medium and high frequency a very good but not the best.The only quite annoying thing with ths headphones is low frequencies (bass drum and bass), which quite poor and difficult to identify clearly. It's a bit heavy also.I rated good because for the price, the quality of product and sound is really amazing."
3,ok,i bought thses because of other reviews about how they worked while mowing. but i was disappointed. they did not block out the noise of the lawnmower as much as i wanted.
5,Koss QZ99 's are BOSS,"I purchased these headphones for use with my metal detecting , and I am quite impressed with their performance to say the least. The clarity is top rate and they are very comfortable to wear with no slippage or pressure points. I rate this buy from Amazon a 5 star .........Kevin M."
3,Sounds fine; poor headband design,"The headband has foam padding, which is fine, but note that it is held in place with hard plastic borders at the two ends. So for the large-headed gentleman like myself :) you get soft foam on the top of your head and hard plastic bits squeezing the sides of your head.Noise blocking is pretty good. I used it at a Sprint Cup race and it was acceptable but I wished it were even quieter--still had trouble hearing some channels at max volume.As for music, I'm no audiophile but music through these sounds pretty good to me!"
1,Total Trash,"The headset is very comfortable, but cancels 0 noise and isn't loud at all. When at a NASCAR race once you combine the super low volume AND the lack of noise muffling you can barely hear the audio. I often split a scanner signal with my 6yo and one of us gets our ears blown out while the other (using this headset) can't hear a thing. I spend the entire race crushing the headphones against my ears to block out sound. I used this set at a race yesterday and it was the final straw -- the left side speaker no longer works rendering them completely useless (which is a positive because it will force me to buy a better set). Spend a little extra and get something that works well and will last."
4,Good noise reduction and features for the price!,"I bought these for a NASCAR race and they worked great! They are straight-forward, fit well, and had a nice volume knob and mono/stereo switch built in. They're not light, but I wore them for nearly 3 hours straight with no issues. The audio is decent, but there's absolutely no bass so I wouldn't recommend these for anything but loud situations with just voices (rather than music)."
5,Same Great Koss Quality,"Every Koss product that I have ever owned or otherwise used has been characterized by excellent quality... including this one. I bought this because I needed better headphones for my new PC with the unfortunately underpowered sound card. The Koss headphones could not overcome the want of adequate volume from my PC, and in the end I had to get some amplified headphones. However, if you're shopping for some great noise-canceling headphones you'll love these. Plus, the coiled cord minimizes the chance of tangling with other cords."
5,Best of its type,I have worked with electric fences over 30 years around cattle and horses. This insulator works exactly as it is supposed to and has the versatility that you can either snap it to a metal t-post or nail it to a wooden post or tree. Nothing more to ask for.
2,Stay with Zareba,"The SC-75 arrived promptly but came to find out that nails are not included (misled by their picture). There is no instruction either as to what size duplex nails would fit. It took me a trip to the hardware store to got the wrong size nails. For $1 more (I spent more than that on gas and time), I would suggest to go with theZareba Electric Fence Black Pinlock Wood-Post Insulator With Nails - 25 Pack PL25WPthat comes with nails. Well, I used Zareba for many years. I have not used the SC-75 yet because I am tired of running back and forth to the hardware store. They could be very nice insulators but I am sorry that I switched brand."
2,A Disappointment,"When I bought this phone for my home office, I was pretty excited about it. Its exterior is an attractive matte silver, the handset feels good in the hand, and has a nifty lighted keypad and screen that even tells you the length of your phone calls. However, this was the first cordless phone I've ever owned whose sound quality on the other end (what's received by the person to whom you're talking) is so markedly poor that people commented on it. When my husband and I tested it out ourselves, we were horrified to discover that this phone is so unclear that it makes you sound like you have a lisp. Also, I never found a way to comfortably hold the handset next to my ear for extended periods of time. It's possible our particular phone was a lemon, but unlikely; we returned it immediately, and are trying our luck with the vtech2431."
2,Think Twice or more before buying this one please for your own good,Static is the best way to describe this phone and both of the other reviews are more than correct. These phones are in the rooms on military bases. Unfortunately this proves that they seem to give our great men and women that serve this country all the throw aways nobody else wants. let's start treating them like the stars they are like the celebrities get please for they are true heros and deserve the best.God Bless America & the worldThank You
1,What are they,"What are the 32 great tracks? You might want to think about listing them if you want somebody to buy the cd. By the way, I would not have given this product any stars but it would not let me post a review without giving it at least 1. I can't really give it a fair rating because I don't know what the hell it is. So the 1 star review is for the tard that put it up for sale with no description."
5,The Best,"I recently decided to upgrade my DVD player, so I wanted to go top-of-the-line. Harmon Kardon has continually succeeded in that category for decades. As with all of their products, this player is well-built and attractive in its simplicity. It's functions are many and varied, but it's extremely easy to use. No bells and whistles or futuristic gimmicks on Harmon Kardon products, just high-quality electonics. In fact, if the display is too bright for you, it can be dimmed or turned off completely. Its disc format versatility is certainly the first thing that attracted me. You can change discs while watching/listening to another, which is a real plus. It's got a great combo of program features and random and repeat play. And while the back-light on the remote is nice, most of the buttons you have to already know what they are since the button functions are illuminated. But since that's the only negative about this player, my advice is, if you have the money, buy this one."
2,harmon kardon dvd 50,"This is a piece of garbage. We haven't had a good day with it. Now of course it's totally out of waranty and still doesn't work. We've been told it has to go to Saddlebrook New Jersey to be repaired, we live in Florida. You live and learn. Boy we're we taken.............................."
1,Not a godd deal for the price,"I decided to buy this equipment to have multiple CDs/DVDs and MP3. After a short time, I had to upgrade the BIOS to solve a problem and recently (after a year) it stop working. I live outside USA and there is no way to service this equipment. I do not recommend this brand in CD/DVD players. Maybe they are good in A/V equipments, but they failed on this player."
4,A Fine Follow-up,"These guys are back with as much brutality and skull-crushing metal as they ever had. The song writing on this record is a little more stream-lined than their previous efforts. Not a bad thing, but whereas on Prophet of Hostility and Wake the Demons FBC jumped around everywhere, this record still has those changes but to a lesser extent in each track. Mostly, each tune has a breakdown that takes it in an unexpected but satifying direction. Songs like Life of Sorrow, where the first half is a speed run and then the drummer introduces the new rhymic pattern on his snare drum before the whole band picks it up. Chopping Block does the same thing; the song starts with a pulverizing rhythm and ends with a groove. Look for the hidden track after The Voorhees Complex. They retracked Blood Flow while recording Titans and it sounds killer. All in all this is an excellent follow-up, and should satisfy their fans."
2,I Was Mislead By The Title,"What a disappointment.Yes, Mr. Lynch knows his craft, but this is not a beginner book by any means.I feel mislead by the title because even from Lesson One, these aren't lessons but rather his little observations on what 'art' is, and how to 'think like an artist' but then he says, 'don't think'...It's confusing.And I'm stuck with this book now and can't return it since I live in Europe, and had my mom send it over to me.Maybe live at his workshops one can get more out of his teachings but unfortunately this book isn't it."
3,"Useful, Not handy!","If you saw any of Mr. Lynch's videos, you must have this Workshop Lesson Charts because this is a support and a reminder of what you saw on his videos. I gave this 3 stars because this book (calendar like) is very very heavy! It's too dificult to carry because it's very big also!"
5,Superb,"All of the songs and performances are wonderful but the last cut, America the Beautiful, made me cry. The emotion put into this cut is palpable."
5,Great book for Newbies - Like Me!,"I had no idea what the interface looked like or ANY idea about how to use 3DS Max; I just knew I want to learn how to do animations.Well, I know this book isn't going to have me making 3D animation movies, but it does give a great insight into the program's basics.Lots of hands-on exercises, just as I like. Lots of pictures too. The authors do an excellent job of spelling out the basics and telling you exactly what you need to do to complete an excerise. And, as you move further along in the book, they ""neglect"" to tell you how to do something they've already covered - just like a teacher would do in class. It forces you to explore, reread (if you don't understand a subject) and practice with the program - what you need to do if you're ever going to learn to use 3DS Max.A very well written book about the basics of 3DS Max 7."
4,fun,What a fun book to read. Silly story about the night before summer vacation (poem format the same as the night before christmas). It will get your children all excited about heading out the door. Really enjoyed it.
1,book not recommended,I bought this book to read to a class. It has NO POSITIVE CONTENT at all that I could see. The idea is that the family has so much STUFF AND JUNK that they can't really fit it all in the SUV to go on their 10 hour drive to the beach. What a ridiculous story!!!!!!! Don't waste your money!
1,Not cool.,"Not cool at all. I've seen most of the early Samurai movies and if you are a true fan you will not like this. Everything about this movie- from the fake B&W to the stupid jump cuts is just bad and silly. No drama, just parody of convention. It's like a 6th grader watched too much Quentin Tarrantino and Kurosawa, (both of whom I love), and tried to make a movie. The music choices are dumb- the camera angels are ridiculous. Not good-bad. Bad-bad."
5,Yet another installment of the good.,"In the first chapter:Syoran realizes he likes Sakura, not Yukito. Sakura gives Yuki a bear, but it turns into a giant.In the second chapter:Sakura defeats the bear.In the third chapter:Sakura becomes sick and is tested by Clow Reed again!!In the fourth chapter:It's Valentine's Day and everyone is giving each other choclate.I advise every ccs fan to get this."
3,Fair to disappointing,The cut Six Months in a Leaky Boat did not have the flute/hornpipe beginning as I had hoped that was on the video. This was a big letdown as the only reason I got the album was for this song.
5,best Of The Boston Scene,"Split Enz may be from down under, but they remind me of the 80's boston scene.If you are a fan of the boston music scene then check out these amazing albums:1) Surfer Rosa by The Pixies2) Lyres Lyres by The Lyres3) Low Rises by Baby Ray4) Vs. by Mission Of Burma5) Fig. 15 by The Human Sexual Response"
5,great memories!,"i've been a fan of split enz, crowded house, finn brothers and neil finn solo, for many, many years. this is great for anyone who likes any of this music. it's younger sounding, obviously, than the later projects by the finn brothers. i love it!"
1,Too small for aging eyes,"Worthless map for me. I use reading glasses now so I require full size maps. This map is 1/3 the size of a typical map. Unless you have vision of a hawk, I would not purchase this map. PS I can read this review just fine with out using reading glasses."
3,enjoyable,"I liked this book, but not quite as much as some of her others, like SEALED WITH A KISS. It was so well written that I felt embarassed for Tom many times. It was as though I was there hiding. Read this, but read some of her other books too."
4,Good to Have This Teacher's Key,"I bought the Lingua Latina program to use with my 7th grade son back in the summer. We had done Visual Latin last year, and loved it, but now needed something to help him with remembering how to use all the different Latin endings! When I ordered the program earlier, I failed to get this answer key, and needed it badly as I have never studied Latin before either. Since I ordered it, this book has helped a lot with doing the workbook questions. I am a little disappointed with the whole program though. I wish there were a little more explanation in English. I am a well-educated adult, but I sometimes still cannot figure everything out. My son likes the reader. He can figure out what it is saying, but he honestly really dislikes the workbook--I think mainly because it is so hard. The repetition it provides is good, but if I can't explain to him 100% what we're doing, it is frustrating for both of us."
2,poor sound,Cheap phone. It has very dirty sound. Range is way under what is expected for a 900 MHz DSS phone. You get what you pay for.
1,Twins,This book was poorly written. It talks about a couple of set of twins. It tells all about the kinds of twins and how it is very unusual to have twins. Although this book is all thhese things it was in black and white. They talk very scientifically. This book again was poorly written.
5,Very uplifting...,"This cd is so uplifting. I especially like ""Circles"" (remember that one from high school!), ""Silver Shadow"" and ""Touch a Four Leaf Clover"". I have been listening to it over and over again and I don't get tired of hearing it. Just beautiful music."
5,Works as expected,My wife used this on her W580i. Kept her very happy until she upgraded to an iPhone.
1,Not much of a movie,"This is a very poorly made, cheap, nudie film. No story or characters to speak of. It is practically a silent movie with silly naration about the girls on screen. At the end there are a few very lame dialogue scenes that seem totally unrelated to the previous scenes. View this only as a curiosity from a bygone era."
5,Solid Performer,"I have owned the HK 3470 about a year now. I purchesed the 3470 because it has Pre-out/ Main in connections which allows the use of an equalizer. I mainly use the 3470 to power a large pair of Cerwin Vega S-2 EE Speakers for a friends outside party twice a year. These speakers have 15"" woofers, 6 1/2"" mids and tweeters. These speakers are made to handle up to 250 watts. The Hk 3470 throws the power to them very well. I play loud dance music and the amp does a great job! Adding the Equalizer really helps to dial in the sound on the Cerwin Vega's.A very good Stereo amp with decent power."
1,Terry Neal's reviewer also went to jail,"The favorable review above of Larry Turpen must be seen in the light that Larry Turpen himself has just plead guilty to felony tax evasion.Crooks of a feather flock together.Aaron Young, the CEO of Laughlin International dba Laughlin Associates, also plead guilty along with Neal and will also be spending a year in federal prison"
5,I had no idea!,"that there were so many ways to protect your hard earned money and assets. Terry Neal does a great job of explaining how and why in a reader friendly, easy to understand format. If you are even remotely thinking of offshore, this book must be in your collection."
5,West Coast Jazz at its Best,"What a thrill to find this album back again complete with the chorus girl on the cover. I first bought this album back in 1959 when it was an LP record. I played it so much I wore out the groves. So to find this well remastered CD is like finding gold in California. Marty Paich is a genuis--his arrangements are phenomenal. And the musicians he got to play them were the cream of the crop of LA Jazz musicians. Art Pepper is particulalry outstanding--his solo on ""I've never been in love before"" will blow you away. Jimmy Giuffre, Bill Perkins, Bob Enevoldsen, Victor Feldman, Stu Williamson, Conte Candoli, Jack Sheldon, Russ Freeman--well you get the picture--just the best. This album is one of the best jazz albums ever produced. Period."
1,Your better off with your iron sights ! or no sights at all !,"Waste of money! WASTE OF TIME! This scope is not good for anything! not a hangun,scout rifle, pellet gun or air soft. Don't waste your money or your time with this ""OPTIC"" ! This scope has plenty of eye relief it would make a good 4 yard goff ball scope that's about all it would be good for. Their is no way to zero this scope. If you change the angle you look through it. The cross hairs changes poistion on the target. Can't focus in full field of veiw at any distance from eye, even with adjustments. I know somebody with the 2732 on a mark 3 bullbarrel single hole at 50,clover leaf groups at a 100. But I won't buy nc star any more it's not the first time they got me. Now I know better should save my money, if your on a budget just wait tell you have can afford better quality. It really is worthless honest!"
5,Again!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have gone through millions, literally. Once I finished ""Broken Time"", I started it again. It's fast, enthralling, with likeable & recognizable characters. Only one thing left to say, and that is to the writer, Maggy Thomas: ""PLEASE WRITE MORE."""
5,Different and interesting,This was an awesome title. The characters are so real it's scary. Siggy's thoughts were so true to life I was thinking it was so kewl. There is not much more I can say but way past kewl!!
3,Not great but nice enough to read,"This book is mildly entertaining. The characture development is the best part of the author's writting. This is her saving grace I think. There are big problems with the story though. I wish she could have done something better with the prisonner MS-12; he has Hannibal Lecter written all over him (pardon the saying), thus is derivative, also the way MS-12 helps end the book could be better, more original. The mental dialog of Siggy's mom inside Siggy's head was a bit much and sometimes irritating. Still, the author's work is interesting and I will look foward to the author's next book with interest."
2,The beggining is great! The ending is horrible.,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this novel. The characters are believable and you enjoy learning about each of their personalities. However, after the first couple of twist in the book it becomes jumpy and disconnected. I hated the explanation of the professor and the unanswered question of who is trying to create a war between the two races. Maybe I didn't understand the twist but I think I would of I would of enjoyed this novel more if it were more polished and the twist were not so outrageous"
4,Broken Time,"This book was one that I did not want to stop reading, but had to go to work. It is such an excellent story. The heroine is believable ....the story is an original ""mind bending"" Sci Fi.Seldom can one just pick a book by an unknown author and truly enjoy the story. I consider myself most fortunate to be one of the first to have read her. This book is highly recommended.I am extremely impatient for her next story....I want it available NOW!"
5,Start this one when you have PLENTY of time,"I read this book yesterday...started it in the morning and read nonstop until evening. The book is just wonderful. There's a heroine to care about, a couple of heroes and antiheroes, and a few human monsters tossed in for good measure. The problem is, determining which is which is not always easy because these people have depth and they're full of surprises.There's also an alien race and a bit of time travel, and yes I know that the way I'm describing it may sound like a bit of a kludge but it's not! It all ties together so beautifully.I can't wait to see more scifi from this author."
1,They Forgot My Mummy!,"Eagarly with anticipation I waited for Halloween night to watch ""The Mummy""! To my horror, I must have purchased the one defective copy of the Legacy Collection The Mummy, for it was not on disc one or disc two. It's just non-existant!After spending $23 for this DVD, I'm sorely disappointed with the set."
4,Great bargain,"I recieved this as a very thoughtfull Christmas present from my wife, and have enjoyed every movie. I like how having all of these movies on two discs saves me space and money, but witheld a 5 star rating because I had to return the set for a replacement. Seems that some sets have technical glitches that render them unplayable. 5 stars to Amazon for replacing my set!"
3,The Mummy - The Legacy Collection,Thanks for the replacement DVD.The transfer of the films to DVD was good. The sound quality fairly good. The scare factor was still there after all these years.
3,Some good movies mixed with not so good,"I am an old movie buff and truly enjoyed a few of these; but not all the movies are of the same quality. If you like complete sets, this is a good collection to get, but not if you expect each movie to be the same caliber as the others."
5,Flash To the Past,"I'm in my 50's so this series of ""The Mummy"" films brings me back to the early TV days when they use to play them all the time.The quality is perfect and the package offer lots of extras like the making of the films by those involved."
3,Not a bad collection,"This collection of the Legacy Collection ""The Mummy"" isn't all that bad, but, not all the great either. However, the classics are all here and truly very well package. If you choose to get this set of the Legacy, get it for the ""The Mummy"" it self. TV channels such as AMC and TMC rarely play it (even when Halloween is around)..so, just get it for that alone all the other Mummy movies are somewhat very good and im a happy with this great collection of movies."
2,Not as good as the other Universal collections,"Of all the Universal monster collections, this one is the worst. Even Boris Karloff can't save this one I'm afraid. Unfortunately, The Mummy and its sequels don't live up to the glory of the other monster collections (Frankenstein, Dracula, etc). I think The Mummy collection is also the worst of the film transfers, and even though I know how old these movies are, the other transfers to DVD are much better. Also, unless you are a true Mummy fan, the sequels included here (Mummy's Hand, Mummy's Curse, Mummy's Ghost, Mummy's Tomb) are just not that exciting. This is all personal preference of course, but compared to the other great collections, this one doesn't stand up."
1,mummy legacy collection,"Bought the Mummy collection because I love the movies on it. Unfortuneately I waited until past the return date to watch the discs. The only one that worked was The Mummy. The discs were loose and severly scratched. Had to throw them away. Big waste of money. That was a year ago and people still complain of this. Really hard to believe. Big hassle for everyone, I am sure. What's up with that? I just oredered another set and would like to order the other popular monsters but am leary. It appears the sellers do not pressure the manufacturer to fix this packaging problem. Why not? They probably should read reviews but do not do so. Good luck if you order any Legacy Collection. You will need it."
4,Good Quality,"Good quality copy of classic movies. Not as good as some copies I have seen, but FAR BETTER than many others I have seen."
5,The Mummy!,"BORIS!Great actor! Great man!The original ""Mummy"" films were scary and fun!Boris is brilliant!"
4,Kharis lives!,Starts fast with Boris but by last movie it slows down. Somehow the mummy gets from Egypt to New England to cajun country.What's up with that!
5,The Mummy - The Legacy Collection,"Great set of classic films!!!Brought back memories of watching these as a kid,and they are STILL scary! :-)"
5,Great Collection,I originally bought this box set (and the others) when it first came out and have loved it since. The quality is good and there are great extras you can watch if you're a vintage horror buff like myself. As far as the films included you can't go wrong.
3,The Mummy - The Legacy,"This collection of movies is probably best for us who saw them in the 40's as all the new tech makes these look quite dated; however, I remember being scared then. I love to watch supernatural movies at Halloween and I had long been looking for the one movie that really got to me when I was a kid ... the Mummy's Curse. Not scary anymore, but still worth my whle."
4,Classic Universal Hororr beats Big Budget Remake,"Halloween is my favorite celebration and I love classic, vintage horror movies. I think the original Mummy film is far more creepy, spooky and scarey than the most recent remake. And the special effects are ground breaking. I like the first of these films best, the story gets a bit redundant, but still enjoyable. Make some popcorn, turn down the lights and prepare for the hair on your neck and arms to stand on end. A must for a real classic horror fan's collection."
5,"MAGNIFICENT print, utterly pristine!!!","If you're a hard-core ""monster movie"" fan like me, you'll be jumping up and down on the sofa watching this INCREDIBLY CLEAN print -- it's as if the movie was just released, it's so clean! THIS is why the DVD format was developed!!! No more bootleg late-night VHS copies but the GENUINE ARTICLE finally available and BEAUTIFULLY DONE! Could it be possible that Universal et al are finally realizing what treasures old science fiction and horror movies are? THIS IS A CLASSIC FILM AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Not by the quality of transfer, not by the nicely done slipcase holding the two DVDs, not by the excellent sound! THIS IS GREAT!!! BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,all these legacy dvd's are fabulous.,"while everyone likes the 1st and original mummy....and it was good .....albeit slow and boring. ive a particular fondness for the mummys hand. it was fun and well made, good locations and what mummy movies are and should be about lots of fun i mean watch it at night its kinda creepy. its got george zuccho, cecil kelloway and the main stars, just a great night at home and to watch at halloween. a classic movie from universal and in my opinion the BEST mummy movie of all. go see its fun."
5,Extremely Helpful.,"What a great, ""no-nonsense"" guide for people who often make presentations in public. This is a ""must-have"" for anyone who works in sales or marketing."
2,Bad quality,"Although I'm happy this series finally arrived on DVD, the quality is rather bad, and there are no subtitles at all. On the other hand, compared to the price for 5 seasons, I guess it's o.k. The stories follow the same rules, but the location and actors are great - like it!"
3,audio or subtitles in spanish?,"hello firends, want to know this complete series have audio or subtitles in spanish? im interesting in this but with audio or subtitles in spanish please.greetings."
1,They don't stay closed...,"I had the opposite experience as the other reviewer.I thought these see-through caps would be more useful than the standard BC flip caps, except when I got them, they were springing open on their own right out of the pack. I tried to fuss with them, and could sometimes get them to close, but didn't feel secure, and when I set the rifle down, the slightest bump popped them open again. I tried two sets for two different scopes, and all four did the same thing. The regular BC flip up caps... locked and tight. These... completely suck, so they are basically unusable. It would have actually been better if they didn't spring open at all, and you just simply flipped them up manually, but not staying closed is stupid."
4,Great album--worth having,"Besides the top 20 hits, I feel that ""See Me in Your Eyes"" and ""One of the Lonely Ones"" are fantastic. No bad songs on this album, just some are better than others. Should be part of your collection if you like this type of music. Love Don Barnes' lead vocals!!!!!!!!!"
4,Special Moments Indeed,"Probably the premiere recording by these Wild Eyed Southern Boys. The first three songs If I Had Been The One, Back Where You Belong, and One Time For Old Times received a tone of well deerved airplay back in the eighties. Heck the video on If I Had Been The One featured some beautiful footage of horses galloping against a country skyline. Nonetheless, If I Had Been The One is a timeless track with beautiful guitar embellishments, passionate vocals of love lost, and stunning hooks galore.Not to omit the other album tracks, but at the worst they are harmless and at the best they are pretty darn captivating. Twentieth Century Fox rocks with a fine southern charm and Long Distance Affair has some strong hooks on the chorus. Don Barnes and Donnie Van Zandt are both in fine form vocally.If you want to remember some good music from the eighties, pick this record up at once. You will not be dissappointed."
1,san francisco bluegrass just doesn't cut it,"i doubt that i could persuade any die hard grateful dead folks from shying away from this. the grateful dead were fine in their day, but don't tread on deep waters of the NC/TN/KY/VA/WV bluegrass. excellent movement of the fingers on this CD and if yer into fast fingers, well fine. but like fast movement of the fingers does not make the blues; fast movement of the fingers does not make bluegrass. it comes with the territority. a valiant effort. but stick with the potheads who don't know music from whatever."
5,"Hot Dawg is not only a style, but the way you feel while listening to this collection of music.","Mr. Grisman is a recognized genious of blending many different playing styles into a fun and pleasing amalgam of music. It's all evident in this album, and the supporting cast members are equally talented. I put my player on 'repeat all' and listen to this all day."
5,Like a broken drum...you can't beat it.,One of the only books on real estate that is still going strong...after 20 years.I found the 60 internet websites on taxes and real estate...to be worth the price of the book. It is up to the minute.
5,"As good as ""It's a Wonderful Life""","This is a heart-wrenching story of a family experiencing many difficulties and facing them with heroic stamina that only God could have given the characters. It addresses modern family flaws with dignity and selfless virtues. The individuals truly desire what is best for the other members of the family. If you love kids, self-sacrifice, dogs, Christmas, and good winning over evil--get this video and share it with others."
4,A superb book and a superb movie!,I really enjoyed this movie! The characters are unique and real. Make sure you have an ample supply of tissues!!
3,Futurama is the best!!,"It is hard for me to only give it a 3 star rating (I want to give it 5 because it is Futurama), but because of the quality I have to. I purchased a few sets of these and when they arrived, they looked GREAT! In fact, they still do! They have a great metal face and feel solid. However, after only a dozen or so uses, moisture has caused the cork bottom to bloat and become un-sturdy. When I set a glass or bottle on them, I'm constantly worried that my drink might spill because it doesn't sit flat on my glass coffee table.Again, they look great and seem to be high quality - The cork bottom is the only downfall. Maybe a rubber bottom would have been a better choice...?"
5,"Effective, Compact, Inexpensive, Nothing Else Needed","For powering US devices that can already convert from 240 to 110 (like my Dell computer), this is all you need. Quick delivery. Great buying experience."
2,Australian/USA converter plugss,I have tried 2 plugs And they do not fit Australian sockets. They are too loose to be useful so you will need to manipulate them with plyers to get them to a useful stage....
3,Outlet plug,"Worked okay, however so ""cheap"" did not outlast the two week tour we were on. Fortunately, it lasted long enough for me to get another."
4,Worked out for me,"Nothing negative to report here; just returned from New Zealand where these got a lot of use charging my camera batteries and netbook. Probably could have done with just one for such a short trip but got two because they were cheap and, you know, just in case I lost one."
3,OK for most transformers,"I bought these adapter plugs plus a more expensive 3-prong adapter for New Zealand. These adapters would not make my Nikon Coolpix battery charger work, whereas the 3-prong adapter would. However, these adapters were OK with the Samsung netbook transformer and my dual-mode sound conditioning machine. These adapters did not seem real secure in outlets, but they never fell out."
4,Great alone or together with the Main Bag,"This bag is a great addition to my Iron Rider Main Bag, or as a stand alone bag. It is the same size as the main compartment of the Main Bag but without the two end compartments. Comes with all the attachment straps you need as well as a rain cover (which doesn't look too waterproof). Only with both ends had the netting on the outside."
2,Didn't fit right for me,"These bags were just awkward. Didn't really fit onto my luggage rack very well. I've tried every configuration of bungees and straps I could think of and it still didn't tighten down like I wanted it to and it would have been a pain in the tookus to get off to take in somewhere. I ended up with a leather messenger bag from the big named dealer where we bought the bike and it was perfect. Rediculously expensive, but perfect."
2,no way,"I bought this product because i thought it would be fun to do and would look great hung up. Not only was it smaller then what i had imagined, but it was also not very durable. The pieces felt like construction paper that I used in 1st grade. the pieces were also cut in a way that made it look like some one just took a picture and cut it up and those were the pieces. It was a huge disappointment."
5,Love them,I love it. sharper than my other pair I had. seems to do the job. very pleased with them thank s
3,"Slow start, better paced middle, fannish finish","I believe this was Weinstein's first foray in Trek novel writing. He had previosuly written an episode of the Trek animated series. The problem with this book is that while it is a very good story, it takes a while to build up any interest in it with some very plodding prose that does pick up in pace as it goes along. The problem is that the pace gets too fast that one is left with a very quickly resolved ending. It almost seems like an episode of The Next Generation series. Give us some buildup and then finish it fast to hit the right page count. And the tacked on ending of Kirk and company parting ways seems so contrieved."
1,Nowhere NEAR being a good Trek Novel........,"This is probably one of the worst Star Trek Novels that I have ever read. First, it got off to a slow start, now that's ok but if it is gonna start slow, it should be longer than 275 pages. Second, nothing much happened, well not as much as most authors put in THEIR novels, and the worst part was the way in which Kirk decided to give up the Enterprise and start teaching? Any good Trek fan knows that AIN""T GONNA HAPPEN! And, the way in which Kirk loses the Enterprise is already a movie anyway. And it's a good movie too. I don't reccommend this book. I'm sorry, but I just didn't like the end, or the way it was written. Good day."
1,The worst Star Trek novel ever!,I borrowed this book from the public library. And boy was I glad I didn't buy it! I didn't get by page 21! The plot was stupid! In chapter 2 Spock keeping telling Chekov what to do. Why doesn't he do it himself?!
2,Kirk.....Teaching????? WHAT!,"The worst trek novel that I have read yet. It was boring and uninteresting. It moved very slow and had a fair plot but the author could not bring out the best in the characters. And the worst part was Kirk, he decides out of the blue to give up his lady (the enterprise) and teach at the academy. After all he's been though he hasn't ever REALLY wanted to do that, and If you want to know how he REALLY lost his ship watch the movies. The only reason I give it TWO STARS instead of ONE STAR is because it is a Trek novel, and i love Star Trek."
3,Good anthology for collectors of Tull,"This is a good anthology of various songs. However, some of the songs are not the entire version (thick as a brick) and others have commentary mixed in (Aqualung) which detracts. Good dvd for collectors of Tull stuff. Not one of my better music dvd's though when compared to recent concert dvd's."
3,DTS AMISS,"I agree with one reviewer,too many songs broken with interviews..And why the hell not in 5.1 or DTS format?? A big miss there"
4,Living in the past (and enjoying it...),"I have recently purchased the DVD after not listening to Tull for few years, so this definitely was a catalyst to re-enjoy this great group. To add even more spice, I have seen them live in the Caesaria Amphitheater a couple of months after buying the DVD and man - they (Anderson and Barre) did not lose their touch.The selection of music in the DVD is good but limited only to those tracks they played in various TV shows over the years before the MTV era. Since you don't expect a 5.1 sound mix you're not disappointed; However the editing could have been better; This DVD tries to be both a documentary and a collection of full tracks but at the end of the day it's neither.Still - the mix of tracks is good enogh to urge you to take out their great albums such as Aqualung, Songs from the Wood, Thick as a Brick etc. and enjoy their great music."
5,A most awesome retrospective,"Folks, This is a must have if you are a Tull Fan. If you missed ""The Hare that Lost his Specticles"" from the Passion Play Tour, this DVD contains the full version of the play/movie from that tour. Highly reccommend this DVD."
2,Yet more butchered Tull.....,"Buyer beware - this is a DOCUMENTARY. Not a concert recording. There are bits and pieces of concert footage spattered throughout, but never more than a minute or two. Partially my fault I guess - the Amazon review does say ""documentary"". But my beef is the fact that Tull already has several other documentary discs out there. As others have said ""please shut up and just play the music""."
3,ABOUT 60 MINUTES OF PRODUCT,"The documentary part of this DVD is probablyclose to 25 minutes if you take the truncatedmusic videos included in this part, out.The music videos portion of the DVDcopies the truncated videos in the docu-mentary portion almost exactly, giving youa lot of overlapping.There are interviews with various membersof Tull, including Martin Barre and Ian Andersonthe only long-standing Tull members, as wellas brief interviews with Glenn Cornick and CliveBunker, but they are short. The interview portionsof the documentary were filmed at a 25th anniversaryparty for past and present members of Jethro Tull.Very little is revealed, but still interesting at times."
3,Not Bad.....BUT......,"I have to say this overview was better than Tull The First 20 years. Less of the crappy videos , a bit more compehensive, and the reunion is intersting. There are a few things on either one that is good, archival footage and interviews - Overall neither is great. This DVD is a bit better than the first 20years....."
3,BEST OF FROM JETHRO,"This dvd is ok, but it's just a ""best of"". Look, for example, at the perfectly Cat Stevens ""Majikat"" DVd..."
2,Many glaring omissions,"I'm doing a research project on J. Edgar Hoover and while I found this useful, easy to use and fact filled...its just amazing when you compare it to other reference materials on the same subjects. All the bad stuff has just been completely left out! In one case that I have found so far they have even gone so far as to outright lie! It's a good jumping off point for sure, but this has definitely been a lesson in checking facts for me, you really have to be careful what you believe."
5,Great 40K novel,"I can't understand what the reviewer below, who is an Eldar player, didn't have enough of in this novel; but for me who am not an Eldar player, I found plenty to love. Fast-paced action, a demon prince, an female Eldar warrior and a Farseer who seemed (at least to me) to be major players in the story as well as a battle in a mysterious dead city on an Eldar home world. The chapter about the Navigator's journey into the warp is fantastic, as well as all the background info about Eldar history. Good stuff if you want my opinion. In fact it is near to being my favorite of the 12 Warhammer novels I've read so far."
2,"With a title like Farseer, an Eldar novel....","...I would have expected more Eldar. Bland descriptions, bland characters, bland story. If it hadn't been set in the Warhammer world, I would have given it 1 star.Being an Eldar 40K player, I was hoping for more Eldar, and more of a look into their complex culture.Nothing really happened in the first 250 pages, and the novel is only 289 pages long! Probably the only interesting character in the novel was the ship's navigator, and his big action sequence wasn't even in the book! Just an afterthought 2 pages before the end with an ""oh yeah, and he won, too.""I was dying to read this book, and I expected so much more from William King. I wanted to give it a much higher recommendation, but I can't..."
2,Bit Bland!,"It wasn't informative enough for me, nor relative to my requirements(which is to cook medieval banquet meals).Not an easy read with no colour, so no not for me!"
4,Wonderful,I loved this book. It has gorgeous full colour glossy photos in it. It is really more of a historical book then a recipe book (although it does have recipes).This is a must have for anyone into food etymology.
1,Not at all accurate!,"Buy this book for the illustrations if you want, but don't be lured into believing that the scholarship is accurate! Cosman does NOT document her recipes (as a matter of fact, she has admitted in lectures to making some of them up), she does not give original recipes and sources, and she continually substitutes ingredients and methods unknown in Europe in the Renaissance. This book is old and the ""fantasy"" research is long outdated by the excellent work of Hieatt, Santich, Redon, Scully, and the like."
2,"Information of varying accuracy, no supporting documents.","Lots of information about food preparation and laws in medieval Europe, including modern ""adaptations"" of medieval recipes. Unfortunately, many of these adaptations are extremely loose, e.g. not showing the original recipe being ""adapted"", and using ingredients that don't remotely resemble anything available in medieval Europe. Enormous bibliography, but no indication of which source any given recipe or statement came from, so there's no way to check their accuracy.On the positive side, the book includes many quotations from sumptuary and sanitation laws, which give insight into medieval food practices."
1,Medieval - It's Not,"Although this book claims to be a historical reference about 1500c cookery it is not an accurate reference. The recipies are not historically accurate, and the book does not provide the original recipes. [bad], ""exploitive"", ""fantasy"" are words that my wife (a food historian) uses to describe this book.Recommend anything by terrance scully."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"Do not buy this product. I have had mine for just over a year and not only is it noisy when I turn it on, but the cds are not burning properly. Last night I tried to burn a cd on 2x the speed and when I played it back on my Sony ES 5 disc changer it wouldn't play. In addition, I thought I would be able to burn lps from this machine, but I've never been able to figure out how to even get it hooked up. From what people tell me, its just not possible. I just purchased a CDRW drive for my laptop, and this is what I should have done in the beginning.I have a business associate that has this machine and he also had major troubles with it after one year of use.I do not recommend this machine."
2,software bug ate my music,"I bought my unit about 3-4 years ago, and it worked fine for the first 6 months, although not all cdrs would play in other cd players. Then, when recording LPs, it began to encode static-like noise onto the cdrs, and finally even direct copies of cds were unlistenable. It was sent to the HK CA repair shop, where it languished for nearly 2 months before the software was reloaded. I finally got it back, and it seemed to work fine, but I have recently noticed older cdrs I recorded now have a similar static noise. Too much money and trouble to be worth a postive recommendation."
3,Verdict Still Out,"The CDR20 is easy to use and the quality of sound CAN be beautiful. I bought the unit and immediately noticed low level static when I made a mix but thought it had to do with my connections. Then, I made an exact duplicate of a CD and experienced no problem. For a number of reasons, I did not make any recordings for several months, using the unit daily as a CD player. I recently bought a new receiver and connections and have repeatedly had problems with static something like a ""scratched record"" sound. Harman Kardon's internet service has been great. I learned thay have had a ""few"" similar complaints that were fixed by upgrading the software. So, the unit is on the way to a service center to be repaired. We'll see. I hope it gets fixed, because I do see the potential for easy use and enjoyment of the unit."
1,Recorded CD's stop working.,"I have had this unit for 6 months and it is really easy to use. My only problems are that there is static on some recorded discs. It sometimes refuses to read it's own recorded cd's. CD's wear out (I record them and play them for a month or two, then all of a sudden, the CD ceases to play on all CD players.) This Recorder is a total piece of junk. I suggest you look elsewhere! If they can't get CD-R's going, what makes them think they can get DVD-R's to work???"
1,Complete Piece of Junk,"I purchased this recorder because it seemed reasonably priced and I already owned other Harman Kardon stereo equipment. This recorder worked well on the first two discs that were burned. After that it became a nightmare. During the recording process, the player (side) would always start skipping on or around tracks 3 or 4 regardless of the disc used. Discs were checked and cleaned to no avail. The recorder would never skip in the same location twice although always around track 3 or 4 regardless of the album. When not recording, all discs would play perfectly without skipping. The player skipped in all recording modes (normal, 2x and 4x) - never during regular play. Tried to contact Harmon Kardon technical support several times with this issue. Due to their lack of response, I will NEVER buy another Harmon Kardon product again."
5,Excellent Book,"This was my first book by Pavel. I accidentally happened upon it in a bookstore and bought a copy for a friend. Naturally; I read it first, decided to keep it, and bought a second copy as the gift. The excersizes are tough; but they improve balance, total body tension, and useful strength. A chronic shoulder injury is currently retarding my progress in the one armed push up, but the principles in ""The Naked Warrior"", ""Power to the People"", and ""Relax into Stretch"" are helping me with other excersizes that I can do despite my rotator cuff tear. I have found the deadlift especially rewarding. There is some overlap in each of these books, but each of them have been undeniably instrumental in my motivation, technique and continued strength gains."
1,Mediocre (at best) introduction to Bodyweight workout,"Like most Pavel's Dragon Door products, this program is big on hype and skimpy on substance. What could be a great program for natural strength, amounts to little in the way of routines, explanations and big on fluff, pictures and advertisements.Furthermore, I question the safety of the 'pistols' one legged squat, regardless of one's age (and definitely not for those of us over 50!). Be especially careful of his advocating holding one's breath during the lift (ValSalva technique)! This reduces venous return to the heart and will increase arterial blood pressure dangerously!Save your money and get Jeff Martone's Pullups for Tactical Athletes, or Steve Maxwell's 300 Workout."
3,"Good Info, But...","...the book, as many have noted, is pricey. The other thing that bothered me was the tone. Pavel more than occasionally dismisses other perspectives in the most childish ways, referring to preferences for ""pink dumbbells"" and making declarations like, ""Go get a manicure"" to ""effeminate"" people who apparently don't train correctly. Can we be interested in improving our bodies without acting childish?"
3,Not that good. Could be worse. Lose the hype,What is it with these self acclaimed bodyweight gurus? Their egos are bigger than the pages of their oversized empty books. I say drop the personal bests of the sideshow freaks included as inspiration and focus on giving the reader good useful information. The marketing never stops with these clowns. His book wasn't as bad as Matt Furey's which included more advertisements than useful information. Two things that you will get out of the Naked Warrior book: one arm pushups and one legged squats. Then you you have the many variations of those two exercises. Save your money people and go to the internet and look up those exercises.
1,The Naked Warrior,"This book is not suitable for anyone who is 50 years or older perhaps not even for much younger. I would have never ordered it had I known. All the exercises are most difficult, actually impossible, and could cause serious injury. I assure you, you will not be able to do anything in this book unless you are highly athletic already. This is a specialized application not for general everyday health/exercise nut like me."
1,A slight exageration to offset all of the fives.,"Yes Pavel has some good ideas for increasing one's demonstrable strength, and yes, one-armed pushups, and one-legged squats are perfect, no-equipment-needed ways to take one through the full range of difficulty in the major muscle groups, BUT why must he be so frugal with his information!. The principles are the same espoused in previous Pavel books and tapes, with two different movements. Every three of his books, (at least), could, and should, be condensed into one, with smaller print, less salesmanship, and a touch of intellectual generosity. I love way his proponents make the sparse number of movements seem like a virtue. It's not, not at $39.95, and not when I KNOW he'll be coming out with another product that reveals some 'secret'; that he's held back until all of the possible income has been derived from this one."
5,Pavel's best book since Power to the People,"Along with Power to the People, this is THE ""how to"" manual for getting stronger. The workout Pavel recommends contains only two exercises, the one-armed push-up and the pistol, a one-legged squat. But these exercises are not merely prescribed as a routine. Pavel uses them to teach you how to gain total body strength via the mastery of muscle tension. Really, the exercises are just vehicles for you to learn the skill of intense, total-body muscle contraction, although performing them will obviously make you exceptionally strong in those movements. In other words, this books teaches you how to be strong in all movements through the mastery of two basic exercises. For those of you put off by the difficulty of the exercises, Pavel demonstrates how to work up to those movements via easier variations of the exercises. Definately worth every penny."
2,Less Marketing More info,"As with most reviews below, Pavel is more of a salesman than author. Overpriced books that have more ad text than information.There is a line between being a ""positive"" coach and a coach with an ego. Pavel travels way past that line, so much that you get mad at him (and yourself for spending too much money).VERY LITTLE worthwhile infomation but try to buy it used or way below cost."
4,Memories,"When I listen to this soundtrack now I am transported to my bedroom in 1986. I loved Left of Center, Wouldn't it be good and Please let me get what I want especially. This soundtrack musically spoke to me as I trasversed through my teenage years. It still holds up now 22 yrs( : O) later!!!"
5,Who wouldn't love this???,"Wonderful, like a time machine for the mind! I loved this movie and I have the soundtrack cassette! Now we know how old I am! Love the CD!!!"
4,A true time-capsule.,"""Pretty In Pink"" is what I always think of as one of the first alternative soundtracks. I mean in the mid 80's, this was the cool stuff you had to search out, and other than maybe ""If You Leave"", I've never heard any of these on radio. This for me, like many I'm sure, was the introduction to bands like INXS, New Order, The Smiths, and Echo & The Bunnymen, all monsters of 80's alt-rock. All of which I still listen to today. ""If You Leave"" was a huge song, and ""Pretty In Pink"" got decent play as well. Another track I love is ""Left Of Center"", and I saw Suzanne Vega live two years back, and when she played that song it made my night. Overall, if you're a fan of 80's alt-rock, or the film of course, this is a must to own. I guess that's why I have it on CD, cassette, and vinyl."
4,Much loved music,"I was in HS when the movie/music came out. Wore out my tape, twice, and melted another on my car dash in the hot sun and had to wrestle a fourth tape copy from my little brother who'd since discovered how awesome the Furs and Bunnymen were. Ahhh, memories. Still enjoy a good reminiscing now and then. I think I've gotta break down and buy it on CD finally! (Four rather than five stars just means I'm a tough grader! It's a great album, nice mix, very 80's retro.)"
4,Still Pretty,"The soundtrack to the seminal 80's classic Pretty In Pink is almost as the movie itself. In many ways it's tough the not think of OMD's ""If You Leave"" and not think of the film. The song is a perfect piece of 80's synth pop and an outright classic. The Psychedelic Furs' 1981 song was the inspiration behind the movie and it elevated the song from an obscure single into another 80's classic (albeit in a re-recorded version for the album). A pre-Luka Suzanne Vega teamed up with Joe Jackson for the haunting and hypnotic ""Left Of Center"" and Jesse Johnson provides a little funk with ""Get To Know Ya"". Inxs recycle the ""Listen Like Thieves"" sound for ""Do Wot You Do"" and New Order adds some goth to the scene with ""Shellshock"". The picture has been hailed in recent times as a perfect encapsulation of 80's high school and the soundtrack provides the chorus to that voice."
2,Not so pretty.,"I remember walking out of the theater thinking, ""well that was not nearly as good as I thought it would be"". The sound track was not much different with some exceptions. First of all, the movie version of the song ""Pretty in Pink"" is nowhere near as good as the Psychedelic Furs original version. Second, the absence of the Rave-ups ""Shut Up"" was disappointing. The sound track is not all bad though. ""Bring on the Dancing Horses"" and ""Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want"" are excellent and as much as I hate to admit it I love ""If You Leave"". The rest is pretty forgettable. If you are looking for a great collection of 80's songs you can do better."
2,Not for me....,"Before I begin, let me tell you this. I am not an 80s person. The only reason I bought this album is because of OMD's ""If You Leave"". I really like that song. Turns out the album was nothing like that song to me. The only other song I liked was ""Shell Shock"" by New Order. All the other songs were just weird. Many had good music but were destroyed when the singers opened their mouths to sing. Two stars is generous for this CD because I only gave it that because of 2 songs. I am looking to sell my copy. I did not like this album. I don't recommend it unless you are a real 80s music fan."
5,Best Soundtrack. Ever.,"So why don't I own it? I taped it off a friend's vinyl (Greg, where are you?) and listened to it so many times that I went out and bought just about every album that these songs appear on. You could say this record nearly single-handedly shaped my musical taste."
3,love the 80's,"i enjoyed the album but it was missing 2 good songs the first one was ""rudy""by talk back, and the other one was rave up/shut up, by the rave ups.if anyone knows were you can get ""talk back""album let me know.."
5,I wish more soundtracks were like this one,"Normally with a soudntrack, you get one good song--two at the max. The rest of the disc is just the producer's brother's gargae band, or a studio knock-off of a classic hit. and maybe a reissue of a classic 1960's tune thron in for laughs.This disk more tyhan transcends this patter. It has achieved apotheosis. In fact, I believe that aetheitically, this soudntrack is better than the film.Every song is great and is a hit in its own right, but this anotholgy gives you something more. It is a slice ofr life of the mid-1980's music scene. My generation became fully alive with this music.We have to relive the 1970's with that dumb TV show. but in the '80's, we had fun, and we knew we were having fun while we were having fun. This disc proves it!"
4,A Good 'Mix Tape',"A pretty good sampler of New Wave pop, if that's your thing. Plenty of nostalgia here for anyone who was a youth in the eighties. Also includes a fine track from obscure New Wave band Belouis Some. Recommended for fans of the period only"
4,informative,"This book is a good, common sense discussion of logic for a layperson such as myself. Several examples of bad reasoning even come from another logic book, i.e. 'Thinking Straight'! However, I think Shaw is correct in his criticisms, which shows even academics in logic can make mistakes.I particularly like how he addressed a death penalty argument. It is often pointed out that foes of the death penalty wouldn't feel that way for the killers of their own family. Shaw points out that even if this was true, those people may later regret a decision that they made in anger, so this argument falls apart.The material necessarily makes the reading a little dry, but the effort is worthwhile."
4,excellent reference for undergraduate Electronics circuits,Excellent text book written in a very easy style for understanding complex electronic circuit theory and practice. The chapter on decibel notation is especially good
4,Southern Rough Boys,"""Wild Eyed Southern Boys'"" 1982 stuff is another of great album that shows their glorious days. CAUGHT UP IN YOU from this album became their first top 10 hit. This album is quite tight with hard rock edge as shown in CHAIN-LIGHTNING. Jim Peterik of Survivor adds dynamism in their smartly written tracks. Together with the two excellent tracks mentioned above, YOU KEEP RUNNING AWAY is also stellar track showing their mellow side that eventually become their trademark sound. Recommended for early 80s rock fans."
2,Not strong enough,The bristles are not strong or hard enough to scrape away the dirty layer on my carrots. So I ended up using it for my cucumbers and ordering a stronger brush for my carrots..
2,I wanted to love this,"I did. I wanted to love this, because Leonard Cohen is the real deal, a poet who works long and hard to produce songs of transcendent loveliness and knowingness. But the reality of it--the Wainwright family and the McGarrigles, and even Nick Cave--is that the singers here have far too much reverence for the material to make it come alive in performance. Except for Cohen himself, but he appears as a performer for only a few minutes. The performances, even by Beth Orton, are just too precious for words. I'd like to see this done again, only this time with Iggy and the Stooges as the main performers. Then we might get some sense of the vitality of Cohen's work."
2,So disappointing!,"I got this as a gift and - thinking it was a documentary on Cohen - was very much looking forward to watching it. Unfortunately, this DVD seems to have been put together by someone who does marketing for the McGarrigle clan (the Wainwrights are kids of one of them), who decided to try to get some face time for these artists by (mis)using Leonard Cohen's name. U2 gains nothing by participating - and the comments by Bono and the Edge were great - but I was hoping for a documentary on the great Leonard Cohen, not some weird performances of his songs by these people that he does/did much better."
5,The sinner and the saint on stage together,"This is a profound tribute to one of the masters of 20th century poetry and contemporary music. From Montreal to NYC, Cohen's legacy, poetry, and art are depicted in a series of old photos, movies and performances by Leonard Cohen. Contributing performers, including Rufus and Martha Wainright, Antony, Nick Cates, Perla Batalla, Julie Christensen, U-2, et.al., interpreted Cohen's songs so well that in some instances, they brought us to tears. The ubiquitous backdrop of the bawdy Slipper Room in NYC added an unexpected even self-deprecating contrast to a man who is an ordained Zen Buddhist monk possibly evoking the lessons in the story of Siddhartha. Nick Cates' Vagas lounge act rendition of ""I'm Your Man"" opening the piece contrasts to Leonard Cohens' ""Tower of Song"" with U-2 at the end underlining the duality of spirit prevalent throughout the documentary. Get the DVD and the soundtrack CD. It's that good."
1,Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man,"If you like Leonard Cohen, forget this DVD. Cohen sings only one song at the end of the DVD. The rest of the songs are done by other people, some of which may even be called singers. It was good to see Julie Christensen and Perla Batella again. If you like Leonard Cohen, buy the Live in London DVD. That one deserves ten stars!"
3,"Why not just ""the man""?","I knew up front that this program consisted largely of Leonard Cohen admirers, with only one cut by the man himself. But I was, frankly, dismayed at the really poor quality of the non-Leonard performers. Really bad stuff, actually embarrassing to sit through! The numerous film clips of Leonard reflecting on his art and himself, plus his most-wonderful performance of ""Tower of Song"" made it all worthwhile. Still, considering the existence of many, many videos of Leonard Cohen singing his own extraordinary music over the years, I must wonder why such a second- (and lower) rate bunch of supposed performers was assembled and allowed to butcher that music. (One of these performers -- ""Antony"" -- warrants special mention. His rendition of ""If it be thy will"" was truly beautiful, befitting the song, providing one listened and didn't watch his goofy wiggling and gesturing -- plain-old weird.) A great chance to make a truly priceless program was, sadly, missed with ""I'm Your Man."""
2,Leonard Cohen - I'm Your Man,I was disappointed. This CD is Leonard Cohen's music but NOT Cohen performing the music.
5,Love Leonard Cohen,Wish there had been more of LC performing. The singers covering his song didn't even come close to performing his songs with the kind passion he puts into them. Are these singers all Canadian?
5,Fantastic,"I had never heard of Leonard Cohen before a friend introduced me to his work. I enjoy his lyrics and feelings in his songs. I am amazed that I had never heard of his work, but am very glad that I have discovered it."
3,He's Our Man,"Fine; as long as it's clear that this is not Leonard Cohen; it's ABOUT Leonard Cohen. This is, I find, mentioned in the Amazon product information, but it's not made clear on the packaging. I believe that most of what works for Leonard Cohen is lost in innovative renditions of his work, but if you want to see some LC family-photos and lots of nifty people doing his songs and saying extremely nice things about him, this DVD might rate five stars from you. Personally, one actual LC performance would do more for me than this whole 'movie.' After a few slow, sentimental minutes, I cued through quickly and didn't notice one."
5,"Brilliant, passionate delivery of Cohen's songs of deep wisdom and humor","This tribute to Leonard Cohen shows passionate performances by various gifted musicians, including himself, interspersed with interviews with Leonard himself. All together it is an uplifting experience which gifts the viewer not only with spirited musical performances of Cohen songs, but also with his deep understanding of life; his liberating humility, humor and serenity in spite of, or because of the limitations of human endeavors. A celebration of and for the spirit and soul."
1,Painful Production,I am a big fan of Cohen and the artists that are on this album. The production quality is painful and distracting from the talent and the message. Sadly I wish this product could have been produced by someone with more expierence. It has the feeling of a film school project.
2,"too little Leonard Cohen, too much of LOUSY COVER BANDS!","Where in God's name they found the appalling musicians who covered Cohen's music is a mystery. (If you have never heard the original music as sung by Cohen, you will most likely not be anywhere as appalled.) The Wainrights were simply awful. Even Nick Cave, who I used to like, is painful to watch and listen to here. Listening to U2's Edge compare Cohen to Moses was also a scary experience...the last part of the DVD when the old master finally sings his own song but is backed up by U2 (a group about 20 years past their prime) was somewhat redeeming but again, could not hold a candle to the original studio version of that song.Worst of all, the interviews and bits with Leonard Cohen are way too few and far in between.If you want to hear a far better ""tribute"" CD to Cohen, I would recommend ""Tower of Song"" instead."
3,Prefrontal Lobotomy,"Disconnecting Cohen's music from his voice is like performing a prefrontal lobotomy.Do we really want to watch Nick Cave preening about as he croons I'm Your Man? Not I.Edge attributes ""...almost biblical significance and authority"" to Cohen's work. Yes LC is great, along with Dylan one of the greatest of our age. But biblical significance? Cohen himself, who reverentially refers to the Deity as G-d wouldn't go there.The film weaves a tribute concert of cover artists together with musings and remembrances from the master himself, images from his childhood and younger life, and various clips from his very excellent recently published Book of Longing. If the concert portion would have hit the cutting floor the remainder would stand as a much more memorable work.The exception to this is a magical moment at the end, where Cohen himself takes to the stage with U2 and delivers a riveting rendition of Tower of Song.The voice is reconnected."
1,Ugh!,"This is the worst Leonard Cohen compilation ever! Most of the singers can't even sing! I bought it because the price was low; alas, you get what you pay for. Furthermore, it would be a waste of effort to listen to if it was free!"
1,a comedy routine !,i`m familiar w cohens work-- some of it i haVE ENJOYED- I FIND HIM OVER RATED IN GENERAL--but THIS DVD IS NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL-- THE SINGERS ARE ALL SINGING OFF KEY-- ALL OF THEM ARE BAD SINGERS--- SINGING OVER RATED MATERIAL SO DRAMATICALLY IT WAS LAUGHABLE TO ME---BUT ULTIMATELY I HAD TO SKIP THRU THE SECOND RATE NON TALENT THEY SCRAPED TOGETHER TO DO THIS---- WhEN JUDY COLLINS SINGS SUZANNE-- YES ITS GORGEOUS-- WHY WASNT SHE IN THIS ? I TELL YOU NOT ONE SINGER SANG IN TUNE ---- WHO LISTENS TO THeSe PEOPLE ? WHO Are they ?? if u love this guy cohen-- maybe you would be interested in this dreck--- being tone deaf would also help a lot-- and a lover paltry melodies and lame lyrics-- pretentious-- it is also pretentious---
5,Deeply Touching,"Other artists sing Leonard Cohen's music live onstage and open familiar songs, by personal interpretation, to great enjoyment and understanding. Spliced in are comments and clips (by Cohen and Bono) that never slow the pace of this music DVD.Edge's accompaniment of Leonard Cohen himself in Tower of Song was worth the price. Leonard Cohen's droll humor in remarks about his life are wisdom hacked from experience, which I found encouraging.This DVD is a gem."
2,Leonard Cohen I am your man,I was hoping Leonard would have sang more of his songs. The other artists didn't do justice to his songs. His other DVD was much more what I liked.
2,Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man,the movie was not what I thought it would be!!!. Not much of Cohen imself at all.
3,needs more,The songs are magnificent. Some singers do well others don't. I'm waiting for a doc wherein we see Cohen perform. Does such film even exist? No one can substitute for that voice.
3,Uninterrupted Pwr Supply,"The Item was delivered in a very short time, not the 10 days indicated when purchased. It is the 3rd one that I have purchased. However, unlike the previous units this one seems to fluctuate its output causing a slight brightening and dimming effect to the picture on the screen. It has functioned well during several power outages, which is its intended use."
5,"Works well, recommended","The APC BR1500 LCD is working well.I've been using it for a couple of weeks and don't have any problem with it.It's silent when AC power is on, the cooling fans only start when the power fails.The LCD display showing the supply voltage is a nice feature."
5,Great UPS,This UPS works as advertised and is a good looking unit. Fits well with my other electronics in the den. Haven't had a power outage yet but I'm ready for it now!
4,APC BR1500LCD Review,The product lives up to its evaluation and it was professional shipped from the vendor.
2,"This UPS insists on 120V ""60""Hz","I unfortunately reside on an island that uses 120V 50Hz for the electricity supply. This UPS is not listed as requiring 120V 60Hz for the input. When it is not explicitly stated, I have gotten used to expecting the electrical devices I purchase to support 120V 50Hz or 120V 60Hz. I gave it two stars, because it costs too much to ship it back, and it refuses to connect up to an electrical supply that is 120V 50Hz."
5,"Clean power, great price.","Love my BR1500. I bought a Samsung 52"" HDTV, and Onkyo 806 receiver. My home is 80 years old, and we have occasionally-noticeable current fluctuations. Having invested $2500 in a TV/Receiver, I felt a good UPS that would also condition the incoming power and remove noise was a no-brainer. Rather than drop $300-$400 on a Monster brand unit, I looked to APC for a solution. Already have 2 APC tower units protecting PC's and other gear in our 2 home offices and they have been great. This is a good unit for a home-theater setup. It's not petite, but the gray case and discreet display fit right in with the rest of the gear."
5,A power back-up for all seasons!,"The APC BR1500LCD 1500VA 900 Watts 8 Outlets back-up is the most impressive reserve of emergency power that I have seen available for home/office protection! This leviathan comes with eight outlets, two of which support the extended use of emergency power, say for computer and monitor for 45 minutes or so. All of the outlets have dedicated filtering as well as a front meter that provides a readout of how much electrical resource remains. Additionally, all of the necessary line hook-ups for t.v./telephone/fax/modem outfitting are provided as well as the computer software to enable a safe shut-down of one's power configuration."
3,Check compatibility before buying,"This UPS uses delivers a step approximated sine wave on battery mode, but computers such as Dell Studio XPS 9000, have an active PFC load, which means it needs a pure sine wave for successful operation. In this case, a BRxx00LCD UPS simply will not work. You need a higher end APC SmartUPS series (SMT750, SMT1000 or SMX1000)."
2,Smells bad,"This item was purchased from Amazon on 10-07-09 for $195.12 + 16.82 tax. For the past five months it has emitted an irritating chemical odor for as long as it is turned on. The odor is irritating enough to induce symptoms that include soreness of the throat and nasal passages.With the computer and all peripherals turned on, the battery backup load is reported as being 121 watts;Estimated Battery time = 40 minutesRemaining battery charge = 100%Sensitivity is set to <88 and > 136 voltsVolts in and out = 124Herz = 60The odor emitted when this UPS is turned on is so offensive that I'm seriously considering investigating purchase of a UPS from another vendor.Too bad, considering that my 10 year old APC BACK-UPS 650 is still performing yeoman service."
1,Failed after 32 days,"UPS purchased to protect my server, but within 32 days it failed and broughtdown my server with it. Error code #6 (internal fault)displayed on LCD"
4,APC Let's You Disable the Annoying Buzzer.,"The Good:If you ever been in an office environment when the power fails you know how annoying it is listening to dozens of Uninterruptible Power Supply buzzers. It's impossible to even think. We know the power is off already, we don't need the stupid buzzer. Thank you APC!!APC Let's You Disable the Annoying Buzzer.No universally loathed blue LED lights.Automatically supported by the Mac OS, no driver software was necessary. Had to install drivers for Windows.The not so good:If you select the display to show Watts or backup time, several days later it returns to displaying the voltage. Hopefully this software bug will be fixed.This AMERICAN Power Conversion (APC) unit is NOT made in America."
5,It's already saved my gear twice.,"APC has the reputation it has for a reason. Although it's not the box its SMART big brothers are, it's completely adequate to protect a system that can handle its squarewave output. It has plenty of outlets and is monitor-able for automated shutdowns."
5,So far so good.,I bought this about a month ago now and it has gone through at least two power outages without any issues. I have never had a problem with any APC products.
5,"Ameno, buena introducción.","Este librito es una muy amena introducción al complicado pensamiento de uno de los antropólogos más célebres del siglo XX, Claude Lévi-Strauss, fundador (o inventor) de la Antropología Estructural, enlazada con la Lingüística Estructural de Saussure, luego Trubetzkoy y Jakobson, y con la Sociología-Etnología francesa que se remonta a Durkheim y Mauss.Las ilustraciones son bastante divertidas, y en algunos casos, indispensables, como en la explicación del análisis de los mitos, uno de los aspectos más complicados del pensamiento levistraussiano."
4,SEVENTIES SOUL,"A Great Album! Moore's voice is rich and expressive, her material first rate. She will always be remembered for the hit ""Misty Blue"" but there is an amazing amount of quality rhythm and blues numbers here."
5,Excellant....,I really was pleased with the prompt service that i received ordering and receiving this cd. I hope to order more from here.Thank You
3,Good for tiny heads!,"While these headphones have a nice, clean sound, and they are inexpensive, the headband is too tight for the average sized cranium! They need a horizontal adjustment to complement the vertical ones!"
2,Ouch,"The headphone's cord is only a little more than four feet. They apply too much pressure to my head, and they pinch and pull my hair (it's only 5cm long) when I take them off or adjust them. An in-ear set of head phones would be cheaper and more worth your while."
4,A new gen. of headphones,These headphones are the best. They produce good sound. They also are comfortable. The price is fitting also.
3,It's okay,"I wish it had a long handle, the knob is just a little hard to handle if you hands have a little ""arthor"" in them."
3,Presses bacon... but shape not ideal.,"It is a nice ""cute"" bacon press but is a bit more form than functionality. A round press close to the size of the bottom of the pan would be better. But there is no doubt what this thing is when people see it."
3,Good for bacon but too lightweight to double-duty for sandwiches/paninis.,It does its job as a bacon press very well. But a little on the light side when doubling as a sandwich/panini press or a meat press.Cute pig pattern gets the kids interested in the kitchen and in helping serve breakfast.
4,bacon press,"This is a great bacon press, I have never used one before and we cook lots of bacon so it has come in handy."
5,Popular Pig,This is a cute and functional pig. My grand kids like to take it out and look at it and it works really well when I am cooking sausage and bacon. It is solid and heavy enough to keep the food flat in the pan.I like the pig!
4,Great little pig!,I use this alot and enjoy it. I also use it for grill cheese sandwhiches and it works great.It cleans up nicely.
1,Handle rusted out,"I bought this bacon press from Williams Sonoma and be warned--the screw holding the wooden handle on rusted out. The handle will not stay attached to the screw which makes the press pretty much useless. We followed the exact cleaning instructions to keep it from rusting, but it happened anyway. While this is a great looking product and worked well for a little while, it is now trash."
5,Great finger food!,"My son has loved Teddy Puffs since he first tried them at 10 months old. He is now 18 months and they are still a favorite. They are a healthy, nutritious snack for his growing body and mind. The cinnamon are his favorite, but he likes the plain too. I haven't met a toddler who doesn't like them either. I highly recommend any of the Healthy Times products."
3,be careful,These are good but like another poster said they are harder than other puffs. Really hard in fact. After the first handful and choking on them they are back on the shelf until she gets some molars.Pretty disappointed as I was looking for some finger food alternatives for my GFCF allergic child.
1,"Original, but used","Just received one in the mail today. It's an original Nokia battery all right, but had plenty of marks and scrataches all over. Terminals look used. The 3-yr old battery that I bought this to replace was in better condition."
5,GREAT BATTERY,I bought this battery to replace a battery that seemed to be causing problems in my Nokia N80 and it works great. I really can't say more. A++++++
4,More Conan!,"As in my previous reviews of this series, my only complaint is that they did not reprint the original comic book covers. Other than that, the art and storys are great!"
4,Super Reader,"A crossover! Conan meets Elric, to fight Prince Gaynor the Damned, and the Green Sorceress. Not too bad either.Thomas also throws in a homage to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd, for one.Gil Kane actually drew some of this, in the adaptation of a non-Conan story of Howard's.As before, Thomas' afterwords are very interesting."
1,Offensive!!!!!,"I've went to Hiroshima this summer, and been sensitized against ANYTHING that pokes fun at wwII. The atomic explosion pretty much killed the book itself. BULL!"
1,man what is this,"This is a total bad book, it is only 5 pages, i could write them in two words, firwall is protection, this was it, don't pay it, you are wasting your money for nothing.5 pages what a book max 90 words of total ... ."
1,Disappointment in Quality,"Stay away from Hooker furniture!!! They may have well robbed me for the crap furniture they are providing to the consumer. 500% happier with Pulaski, Bassett or Lane furniture. Hooker is cheap China junk!"
1,Avoid HK,I had an AVR300. HK replaced it with a 310 after the volume kept cranking all by itself (known design flaw) and the video amps died repeatedly.The 310's video amps just died and the repair shop sent it back to me with video 1 still dead and surround sound dead.These suck. I am buying a new AV receiver.
1,A great paperweight!!!,What a piece of pure JUNK!I have had nothing but problems with this thing. My first one broke within 3 weeks. I took it in for service and they never could figure out what was wrong with it so they gave me a new one. Get it home and the same things are happening. No display sometimes and totally sporadic other problems. I call HK and they tell me I need to reset it. Ok... I pretty much have to reset it every time I want to use it. It goes close to 6 months with no use while I design my theater room at my new house. Go to use it and...nothing! I give up!!! I try to call but the service is closed for a week.Never again. :(2 HUGE thumbs down on the HK BLUNDER!
3,Awesome Album But Wont Play In My Car,I have loved this awesome Messianic praise & worship group since I was a child. The albums have lost none of their flavor and vigor! HOWEVER the coding doesn't allow it to play in some cd players!
3,Seer moves into the Ragae,"As far as Lamb is concerned, this is a good CD if you like mild Ragae. It tends towards that sound. Unfortunately most people are used to a certain sound from a group, and come to expect them to sound that way forever. Most that last don't. Lamb did not either. Their 5th album, New Mix was completely different tending toward hard rock. Lamb in my opinion did not grow old they stayed young, experimenting with new sounds and growing up with us. If you liked their first 4 Albums (I, II, III, and Songs for the Flock), then check out Dancing in Jerusalem or The Year of Jubilee. Those are similar sounding, and the quality of recording is much better."
2,i don't dig these kind of Projects,"Frank Sinatra&later Ray Charles hit pay dirt doing these type of Projects which basically re showcase past hits or a Cover of a song to appeal.Herbie Hancock has always been able to stay with what was current,but here He has alot of so-so arrangements&Colabs that just never quite get off the ground.it's very Middle of the Road.Herbie is a Badd Keyboard Player,but He has also done some rolling with what is working at the Moment type of Projects as well.some times it works&some times like this one it doesn't Groove at all."
4,Possibilities,I was expecting every song on the CD to be great but there were about three songs that didn't wow me.
2,Boring...,"Hancock is the big monster of jazz, a master in the game of improvisation and electric fusion. Headhunters, Thrust, Man-Child and even the '95 acid ""Dis is da drum"" proved it. Or the avant-garde ""Sextant"". I'm a big fan of Hancock because he really ""speaks"" when playing keyboards / piano.It's sad, but this is the exception to the rule... this album is not ""horrible"" as a consequence of a bad experiment... it's horrible for its mediocrity. Possibilities is really boring, putting in evidence the lack of creativity. A bunch of clich?s, conceived to be used as background music. There is no risk, no new ideas, nor good music..."
2,Should Have Bought Just The One Song I Liked,"What a disappointment this album was. If not for the first duet with John Mayer, this CD would be nothing but a coaster for me."
1,JAZZ IS OFFICIALY REBORN.,"Well Welcome to the 21st Century.Jazz is reborn, i stand corrected - this album grew on me like nothing else.Great Effort.POSSIBILITIES? yes for sure."
1,Herbie Halfcocked,"Herbie tries to resusucitate a moribund career a'la Carlos ""One-Lick-Pony"" Santana.If you like Santana's last three musical sticky buns you'll go in for this pink packet of artificial sweetener."
4,Can't blame him for going Santana's way,"I think Herbie did a good job. Some of the tracks in this album are inspiring (i.e. his performance with Annie lennox, Sting, John Mayer, and Joss Stone to name a few). The last two tracks are sort of weak but the others more than make up for it. A good array of styles here! but overall a great jazz/pop, jazz/blues and jazz/rock album."
5,Great Smooth Jazz CD,"The first time I heard ""Stitched Up"", I immediately recognized John Mayer's soulful voice and asked myself, when he come out with a jazz album? Well, I had to wait until the song was over to find out it wasn't John Mayer, but really Herbie Hancock. This is an amazing CD which deserves my 5 star rating. However, after playing ""Stitched Up"" several times, I can't quite understand why John Mayer and Herbie Hancock chose only to collaborate on this one song because it is the best song on this album so far. I really enjoyed listening to the jazzy styling of ""Sister Moon"", by Sting and ""A Song for You"", so beautifully vocalized by Christina Aguilera and ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" by Raul Midon (who by the way sounds so much like Stevie Wonder).Overall, this is a wonderful CD to listen to as you are driving down PCH, with the windows down and the wind in your hair!!"
5,Excellent,A great purchase! How could I go wrong with Herbies musical genius. A talented collection of international musical performers . BRAVO!
3,Not Very Stirring,"I bought this CD for a number of reasons but primarily to hear Christine Aguilera's remake of Leon Russell's A Song For You (go listen to it on his Retrospective album). But I found that all these wonderful, powerful artists giving muted performances. I might use this CD to lull a baby to sleep or when I want background noise that doesn't interfere with my thinking but not if I want to get lost in the music."
3,"Herbie cashes in on ""Santana""","Carlos Santana may not have started the celebrity singer/player duet format, but certainly, he's had the most success with the idea of inviting guests to appear with him on his recordings. Herbie Hancock jumps on the bandwagon with the C.D. ""Possibilies"" with mixed results. It's not that the C.D. is bad, because the performances from people like John Mayer, Annie Lennox, Jonny Lang with Joss Stone, and Raul Midon are excellent. For me, the problem is when Hancock adds his signature jazz keyboard interpretation to the songs. Sometimes he goes off on a tangent, completely leaving the melody of the song behind, which I find annoying. If you can overlook Herbie's ""contribution"" to the music, you'll like this C.D."
3,Over-produced,"While this album was recorded, the sessions were filmed and released as a documentary called ""Possibilities"". I loved it, watched it 3 times (twice with my teenage kids!). Compared to the film, the album doesn't have the same magic. Three examples: in the video track, John Mayer was inspired, creative, playful, so musical. The album track splices some segments that don't flow nearly as well. In the video track of Safiatou, Angelique Kidjo was simply amazing while Herbie and Santana both comp'ed and solo'ed beautifully. In the album track, the song was re-engineered into call-and-response between Kidjo and Santana, which never gives Kidjo a chance to build her lines. She also needed better EQ as her voice sounds too thin. In the video track of ""I do it for your love"", the African percussion rhythms were unforgettable. In the album track, you can barely find them and the whole feeling is lost. Five stars for the video, 3 stars at best for the album."
4,A suprising collection of music,This album has a lot of pleasent suprises from the unusual duets formed to record this album. It was a bit different than I'd expected and so it took a few listenings to appreciate the overall quality of this album. Possibilities has become a favorite.....
5,Possibilities,This is just great music. I saw the television program on PBS and loved it. I had to have the CD!
2,what's the point?,"I have adored Herbie Hancock since I was 16. My fascination with his Headhunters later lead me to ""Maiden Voyage"" and his other Blue Note productions as well as his contribution within Miles' quintet. So, you can tell I have been a devoted follower. This latest release buffles me. What was the point of Herbie's doodling on the piano behind the ""top of the pops"" list of characters? I do like Annie Lennox, Sting, Santana but they and Mr. Hancock don't make a good match. I am aware of continuous popular music influence on jazz (best ballads are made of brodway tunes) but this cd does not attempt to interpret, expand or do anything interesting with the material. Someone, please tell me what was the point?"
3,mediocre,"i am a vintage audio guy and was dying for some new music. when i looked at the artests lineup i said what the heck.well, the musics are mediocre, i have to say Santana definately do a better job in his collaborated CDs.nevertheless, i do enjoy a few tracks and feel justified."
2,Disappointing and underwhelming,"This is not a very interesting disc...extremely mundane. The hype that surrounded it was just that. With the exception of one or two decent submissions by Herbie's collaborators, this CD is a real sleeper, and I mean that literally.The ""Possibilities"" for this compilation were endless, unfortunately, they weren't realized. Not even close. What a boring collection of over produced mediocrity."
2,Dissapointed,"I had heard a lot of hype about this CD and fell for it, ordering without ever hearing any of it. So far I am very dissapointed. I enjoy most all kinds of music, but this CD is one that I just can't seem to enjoy."
1,It was such a let down...,"Amerika Jones has a beautiful voice but its wasted on her renditions of the dialect poems...as typical of most Dunbar orators I have heard the dialect is delivered in the most stiff, over or un-dramatic styles...its terrible whats out their, I wanted this tape to be wonderful...I love and have a deep respect for his works... but this production does no justice to the beauty of his words. Audio tape of Dunbars dialect poetry, are available if you would like to hear the ""character"" in his poems and not the ""Amos and Andy caricature""..."
2,"I love the concept, but fails to deliver.","I bought a pack of these at a trade show about 4 years ago. I absolutely loved them. I have fibromyalgia and chronic pain problems due to a back injury. I used them almost every day during the winter months. Then they stopped working about six months into use. I would snap the button inside, but they failed to change all the product in the pack. I would boil them, but they wouldn't turn clear again. I finally gave up on using them. Really sad about it because I wanted to buy more in the bigger sizes. They would have been perfect for backcountry camping and hiking trips. Too expensive to fail so miserably."
5,Instant heat,This is a great product that works well for cold weather camping or muscle pain. I realy like the fact that it is reusable.
4,pads,The product is a good product. However should come with pouches or straps to hold in place. I would recommend to others.inconvenient to boil when finished
4,Great for short-term heat,"These little guys work like a charm. They heat up fast and hot. They only last about 1 hour so they're only for short-term usage. The exterior casing, vinyl maybe?, is very durable."
5,good for the extra sauce!!,"it's very cute and useful for the extra sauce dish for salades, oil and vinegar, ketchup, salsa and etc."
4,Bitter Sweet,Good story--would certainly read other books by this author. Kept my interest through out. Always nice to see a good ending to the story.It is never too late to have life give you a break.
5,I would kill for this CD,"I love Joan Armatrading to death, her music is timeless and I cannot do without it. I wish someone would re-release this out-of-print gem to the public. They are depriving me so hard! Ahhh! Frustrationnnnnn!! I love every single song on this album. If you're not listening to Joan, you're missing out on something so wonderful. I know I will always treasure her and this timeless music. Dear god, thank you for Joan."
2,NOT for beginners,"This book is completely off-base when it says that it is for complete idiots. Take a look at this book and you will find that nothing is clearly explained. They jump around a lot when writing. In order to be capable of understanding this book, you have to be well adjusted in the world of astrology, probably even a certified astrologer, and I do not exaggerate when I say this. I am pretty well-educated in astrology and thought this book would explain things I didn't know a little clearer, but it doesn't. Sorry, yet another failure from the line of Idiot's books. Instead of this book, I might recommend the one for Dummies instead as that one is a bit easier to understand."
3,A good book with a bad title,"This is a wonderful book to use as an introduction to astrology. The explanations are oderly and easy to follow. The beginning student will get a thorough understanding of the basics. The technical terms of astrology are barely covered. The more confusing astrology techniques are barely touched upon. I guess they think an ""idiot"" wouldn't understand them. This book will only give you an idea of real astrology in action. This book just talks about the planets in the different signs and houses, with a heavy dosage of sign traits. Humor is this books strength. I find humor missing from far too many astrology books. This is a ""fun"" book, reading is enjoyable. There is a small chapter on tarot cards, palmistry and numerology, enough to peek your interest. In conclusion, even a professional astrologer would have fun reading this book and the beginner will receive a clear introduction."
4,Useful for what it is.,"This guide is a good reference text to take a beginner to the next step. I'm using this book to take my chart's information I got free, online, and extracting the correlating data. With a simple list of my planets and houses and their motion, I've been using this book to create a much more wonderfully in-depth and descriptive chart than I've ever had before.Is it a perfect introduction, especially for the purposes of drawing and reading one's own chart the ""old fashioned"" way? No. However, through reading the explanations of different individuals' charts, you will pick up the general understanding of what is where - what these symbols mean.It's a really fun book that doesn't provide too much or too little. It doesn't claim to teach everything, but they give you a lot.Free online profiles helped me get started -helped give me that first ""Wow! That's really me!"". The authors recognize the ease of this, and I'm glad they note it in their text.It's a good start."
2,An hilarious read!,"This book will have you rolling on the floor! The authors actually try to convince the reader that the stars determine how a person's life will turn out! I my view, this work has to go down as one of the best attempts at satire in history. The funniest part about this book is that, based about some of the reader's comments on this page, some readers actually feel for this hoax!!!"
3,So-so thriller,"The Black Tulip is a military suspense novel about the CIA assistance to Afghanistan during its war with the Soviet Union. This book is somewhat like a flat soda; the flavor is there, but there's something critical missing that limits your enjoyment.In the book's case, the problem is the characters. Bearden shows that he is decent with description and with plotting, but his characters are insubstantial and never really evoke any feelings. The story also hinges on a major coincidence involving the relationship between two of the protagonists...indeed, even Bearden occasionally seems uncomfortable with this coincidence.This is not a bad book. This is not a good book. While Bearden appears to have the beginnings of being a good writer, he is not there yet; perhaps he is better with non-fiction, but in fiction, he still has work to do."
1,Plastic one-dimensional characters making political speeches,"A cliche wrapped inside a cliche - polyglot Fannin never fails, wife is beautiful and rich, Russians are awash in self doubt and all wind up working for CIA! If only it were true! Writing is so bad that a misplaced modifier at one point has NSC member arranging death of Bill Casey! Maybe some day a CIA officer turned author will write a book telling it like it really was, full of screw-ups and bureaucratic infighting, rather than how they fantasize it to be."
4,"informative, interesting, a good read","Although it becomes slightly uneven towards the end, Mr. Bearden has crafted an entertaining book that I recommend for anyone. He blends his experience with the CIA with a great plot (which falters ever so slightly towards the end). His characters a developed well-enough for his tale, without too much detail or boredom. His conversations never appear stilted or unrealistic, but instead, he manages to capture the moment on several levels. On top of all of this, he neither writes down to the reader, nor does he insult the reader's intelligence. Better yet, his subtle approach to some issues and careful crafting is so nicely done, that you find yourself cheering for some of the characters while wishing serious bodily harm to others. Best of all, he shows just how crazy our world is. A very fine job, Mr. Bearden. But damn you, sir, your book kept me up all night until I finished.I would lover to read a book by him on the current IraqNam fiasco."
1,Beware the Shipping Charge,"The price of this drill bit looks like a good deal: but beware of the shipping and ""Handling"" charge. It is nearly $13! For that I can buy a high quality bit locally."
2,worked.. then snapper,This Bit worked for the first hole I drilled. Then snapped in half for the next. The Quality Import bit really lived up to its Quality import name.
5,Who doesn't love Steve Martin,"I have watched his standup, love it...funniest comedian of his day....awesome..and put a banjo in his hands...and its double awesome !!!"
1,Stopped reading CDs,"I loved this unit and it was faithful for over 4 years, but mine, like others, stopped reading CDs. I am exploring fixes for this, but am not optimistic based on other reviews here."
1,What a Piece Of,I received this DVD player from a raffle through BMW NA and it didn't work from the get go. It wouldn't turn on and it wouldn'tplay DVD's. This piece of equipment is horrible. DON'T BUY IT IT IS NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE I'M ABOUT 1 STEP FROM THROWING IT OUT THE WINDOW>
3,More interesting than exciting,If you do a cover of a well known song you must change it enough to distinguish your recording yet leave it recognisable. The versions on this album are distinct enough to be worth the effort but they lack the grandeur that makes the originals great. Gone is the extraordinary showmanship Dennis DeYoung brought to his vocals. Gone is the agony of JYs screaming guitar. In their place is a more respectable laid-back and folkish sound. These are good songs performed well but they don't inspire the way classics do.
4,A new take on the old songs...,"How could one not love Styx? Yeah, they're bombastic and their 70's and 80's hits sound a bit dated now, but Styx always crafted melodic rock that stuck with you.Here's a fine and fun set of Styx songs done in decidedly unStyx ways. And it's a bit of a revelation.My favorite tracks include Alva Star's lovely rendition of ""Lady"" (ditto for Jeff Krebs' version of ""Boat on the River""), the bizzare take of ""Babe"" by Jim Roll and the Famous Authors, the emotional Beki Hemingway track, and the punk-indie ""Grand Finale"" by Hearts Beat Red.Overall, it's a must for Styx fans..."
3,Cobra GMRS review,"The Cobra 1000 is a basic and reliable 2-way radio. It could be better with the addition of some other useful functions like a scan mode or privacy mode. As a receiver, it lacks sensitivity at times to catch the faint signals but in the trasmit mode, it really sounds very good. My only major problem with the radio is the design of the battery compartment. It is a ""snap"" cover which doesnt really snap that well and which will be a problem as the radio is used more frequently. I already have to use a rubber band around one of the radios to keep the battery in place."
3,It's pretty good.,"It's a pretty good, but half the tracks soun' the same. The best ones is Rollin', Click-Clack, an' Doin' Ya Thurlthizzle."
4,yes...,"I'm not all that into metal but I love this band. As another reviewer mentioned this band is just fun. I saw these guys live with Mastodon in Seattle and it was a great show even though there was some slight microphone ""difficulty"". I had a smile on my face for a long time after that show. Buy this album and crank it up to 11."
4,Metal As Hell...,"I found out about this band through a video game (sadly enough). I liked the song (Deadly Sinners) so much, I went out at bought the album. From start to finish this album is METAL AS HELL. These guys really know how to be brutal. Fortunately for the metal scene, these guys are a throwback to the awesome metal of the late 80's. These guys are in no way shape or form associated with the hardcore genre, so it's safe for you to like them because chances are they won't be ruined by bandanas and X's. CHECK THEM OUT and stay brutal."
3,"Good initiative, needs time to mature","Deadly sinners is the only track that is worth the album, the rest sound just like each other. This band has a good idea going, they just need to mature and express some creative variability in their compositions and lyrics. Give them a couple of years. I'd suggest adding some bagpipes. Now THAT would be cool."
3,"3 Inches Of Shi- I mean ""Blood""","Deadly sinners is a freakin awesome song and should be heard by anyone who is a metalhead. The rest of the album with the exception of Lord Upon The Boiling Sea II is not so good. The other songs lack the variety and enjoyability of ""Deadly Sinners"", and essentially sound pretty much the same, with Cam Pipes squealing throughout. give the band time and experience, however, and they can make a better album."
4,rampaging hordes of olde,"verily, these mystical tales of power and magic shall transport you unto forgotten realms of strength and fury! if you dare, prepare your heart and mind to endure the cosmic firestorm so that you might return, changed and triumphant, to restore wonder in this soulless land..."
4,Proper Metal.,"Tired of self-pitying weak Metal? I know they're easy targets but while middle-class millionaires like Korn and Limp Bizkit moan and gripe, bands like this put out rock-solid workmanlike albums of power and honesty. Seeing as they're new I'll do the comparison thing. Think At The Gates mixed with Accept. Blood curdling vo-kills and ripping songs. Just check out the titles. Are they going on about their girlfriends leaving? No, it's ""Enemies of Metal, your death is our reward"". Is there a song called ""I'm depressed and lonely""? No, but there is one called Axes Of Evil. Hail, hail, hail!"
2,Iron Riot?,"When did Kevin Dubrow quit Quiet Riot, join Iron Maiden, and secretly change the name of the band to 3 inches of blood?"
2,They Have To Be Kidding...,"Here is the thing - I honestly believe that these guys know that their band is a joke. They have to. With that in mind, the music is kind of comical. ""Enemies of metal: Your death is our reward!"" has to be one of the funniest metal lyrics of all time. Granted, it is also tied for most retarded. But the band is devoid of any musical talent, whatsoever. If you want a laugh, listen on. If not... odds are you're gonna hate this band."
2,Not too good,The vocals are really good thats why I gave it 2 stars. The other 3 well they're gone cause the band plays the exact crap over and over AND OVER in every song. It's not what musicians do. The perfect example of musicians is like Dream Theater. These guys suck.
1,Skyjacker shims...aluminum?,"Material wasn't listed but, I thought for sure Skyjacker would've made these from steel. They're not...they'r aluminum. Total junk, and I would never put these on a lifted 4x4."
1,not a single musical sound anywhere on this DVD is made by Pantera,"What a huge disappointment. The ""rare archive footage"" flies by a few seconds a time with no audio track. I can barely get through this. Insulting. I wasted my money."
1,Basically a rip off of VH1 Behind the music,"Some new interviews by first Pantera band members (Not Terry Glaze) and other people. One thing that really bothered me was the music playing in the background, it's as if they are saying it's Pantera but any person that has heard Pantera knows it isn't AT ALL. Not worth your money."
3,Alright for the price,"I bought these knives back in October and they started rusting almost immediately. If you allow them to soak before washing or let them air dry, they will most definitely rust. You must wash and dry these knives immediately after using to minimize rust.Although I'm disappointed that my knives are already rusting, I'm not too upset or surprised since I didn't spend a lot for them. If you're looking for a cheap knife set they're not bad, but if you expect to have nice knives for years, this is not what you're looking for.For the price, they're really not bad, but unless you're broke, spend a little more and get something that will last."
4,Good to read to school. Nice introduction.,"A nice story with illustrations although it does not give the kind of detail that my children & I crave. I paraphrased it, using the pictures, for a group of 3 - 6 year olds at school and they liked it. An easy introduction to Diwali for them. Then I showed them a few things, including a clay oil lamp and we had Indian sweets. For pictures of a more traditional celebration and those details, use the 2 page spread in ""Children Just Like Me: Celebrations!""."
4,great technial resource,"This book is not for newbie or non-technical person. If you want to sharpen, your java skills add this book to your shelf. Although JavaDocs should be the first place to look for technical specification but this printed, form has its own advantage. Specially if it's hard for you to read online grab a copy of this book. Book is technical, precise and well compiled. Great reference book. Hey, if you are one of those people who go for examples rather than specification then save you money for something else like almanac"
5,Indispensable for the SCJP exam,"The Java Language Specification, The Java Programming Language Guide (4th Edition), and the SJCP Study Guide for Java 5 (Sierra, Bates) are essential to passing the SJCP exam. The Java Language Specification gives you the important technical details that textbooks tend to leave out. The best way to use this book is to make small, simple test programs for each chapter or topic (the programs that the authors provide are too cryptic for my taste). This book is not a tutorial and you should have the level of knowledge aquired by studying the Java textbooks by Walter Savitch and/or Daniel Liang. It's also a good idea to have Head First Java (2nd Edition, Sierra, Bates) in your bookshelf with the others - plus anything by Cay Horstmann (Core Java I and Core Java II.)"
4,Good but not thorough...,I'm hoping a more up to date version of this book will come out soon. There is a lot of good coverage and examples in this book but lacks details in cases such as inner classes (all the neat ways of instantiating them). It's a good starting point if you know some other language and want to get into java.
5,Steelers 2007 Calendar,"Great photos for all Steelers fans.However, FansEdge has failed to respond on shipping only a partial order. I ordered 2 calendars in Dec 06 and only received one. Although I have emailed their service department twice, I have not had a response to date."
3,Inspirational Book for Teachers,"Guy Doud was 1986 teacher of the year. Hailing from Brainerd, Minnesota, he writes of his difficult experiences growing up and how his teachers and peers affected him.Doud demonstrates that teachers are the molders or destroyers of dreams. All of us, then, are teachers and we are letters to others simply by our actions.As teachers, we can write letters of hope and encouragement or failure and distress, on the hearts of those we meet.Doud challenges the reader to ask whether they want to be remembered for a letter that is positive or negative."
3,Great Novelty Glass,"We have enjoyed the Half-Yard Ale Glass , to drink our KWAK beer. It is a terrific conversation piece . Difficult to wash ."
3,"This was an unfinished film, due to the fact H B Halicki dies while filming it.","Someone correct me if I am wrong, it is to my understanding that H B Halicki, the writer, star and director of Gone in sixty seconds 2, died during of all things a boat stunt while making this movie. It would be correct to reason; poor editing and use of footage from his other movies was due to the fact the writer, star and director(not to mention the $producer$) was DEAD! that could explain it."
4,Fulfilling a dream,"Pretty amazing that one man had the ability to write, film, act, direct, market his own film. This was fun to watch knowing he brought his dream to life , and had the courage to overcome many obstacles to achieve it. It was a shame he was killed , his talents could have really teamed nicely with Spielberg, Bay, Bruckheimer, etc."
1,NOT BOTH BOTTLES,"This is terribly misleading. While the picture shows both the large and small bottles of the Slide-O-Mix set, this only includes the large bottle. I thought I was getting a good deal on the set, but false advertising has definitely given this product it's poor review. Who would only want one of the bottles anyway?"
1,DO NOT BUY! FALSE ADVERTISING! ONLY ONE BOTTLE!!,"False advertising, I'm demanding a refund. The picture shows both bottles but the only send you one bottle. The ""system"" can't work if you don't have both parts!! do not buy!!"
5,A Great DVD!,"""Andromeda Season 1, Vol.2"" is a great DVD. Besides the fact Andromeda is great show. The DVD is loaded with a lot extra features including: Bloopers,Commentary,Character profiles, and episodes in wide-screen. These DVD are great value for any fan of the show or someone just discovering it."
4,good book,"This book is very practical and easy to follow. It gives preperation instructions for grilling, smoking, and baking for each recipe. It also give instructions for steps you can do in advance. The only reason I give this book a 4 is because it uses some comercial products, such as plum sauce and green tobasco. I prefer to make everything from scratch. Otherwise I would recomend this book."
5,Yeah Baby Yeah,This is one of the barbecue books that you need to own. I have a few burger/barbecue books and this one as well as burger meisters are the best.
3,Bare Bones NYC Gem - Not A Milestone but Noteworthy.,"I just dug this out of my collection and I have to say it's not a mind blowing set but it has it's moments. I esp. liked ""Rawness"" with M.O.P. and ""Get Mine"" with LaShonda. A previous reviewer didn't care for LaShonda's vocals which I personally felt were decent but didn't detract from any of the songs she was on (2). Telling the truth it really takes me back to when NYC had multiple distinct sounds that each provided something different to contribute to the region. Teflon's album is what I like to call a ""Crate Digga Classic"" - The kind of album that will never be highly regarded or sought after except by people who really enjoy digging through dusty store shelves looking for off the beaten path hip hop. I'm giving it 3 Stars but it's more like 3 and 1/2."
4,UNDERRATED!,"NO need for me to speak on this album.. if you like hardcore lyrical rap, with intense vibes troughout the album... if you like M.O.P. this is a must have for any fan.. this is 4,5 out of 5..!"
5,Great Record!.,"Hi!.As expected it is a great record because of the music selection and the performers especially Ginesa ortega a real ""cantaora"" for those who appreciate the flamenco gender. If this is your case just buy it!.Mario Gasca"
4,Generation of '98 Music,"Best selections from the ""musicals"" created by Garcia Lorca and De Falla.A must have for advanced Spanish classes."
2,Buyer Beware !!,"For this spacemaker you will want to lower your expectations. Installation was not bad however we did not get a template in the box. Sound quality is like a little protable radio so don't expect it to be the quality of, say a boom box...it's not there. The Bass Boost is worthless, I notice no difference when it's on. You should also be aware that the reception is very poor. I was not able to get stations I can get on all other radios. The attenna is in the power cord which must be stretched all the way out for mediocre reception so plan on having run room for the cord. I was very dissapointed with this product and would not recommend it. For half the price you can get a small boom box or radio that will sound much better. The stations are not easily set. You have to scroll through the stations so plan on having presets or spending plenty of time holding down the tuning button. Based on functionality and materials quality this product shouldn't cost any more than $50 tops."
1,Terrible Radio,"Wished I had read reviews 1st. Absolutlely terrible radio reception. I also get loud whooshing sound in background of fm stations, and can receive almost no am stations. Remote has never worked. Technical or customer assistance from GE is nonexistent. Only function that works is CD player."
3,"Saves space but FM reception needs ""fine tuning""","We wanted to clear up the counter so we received this unit for Xmas. It was never used because of the POOR FM reception. We kept our boom box out right next to it for 4 months. I finally opened the unit up and uncoiled the small, black FM antenna that was wrapped around the power cord. After feeding it thru the remote control hole, we can pick up every station that the boom box could get with even less problems. So, if you want to fiddle with the ""internal"" antenna, the unit does perform reasonably well."
1,GE please HELP,"I purchased this unit in October/01 and have had nothing but trouble with it. On the radio AM or FM mode when you set the volume to where you want it, after a few minutes the volume drops right off and you can't hear a thing. It works OK on the CD player. I have had it exchanged three times and it is the same with each new unit. I wrote GE in Canada three months ago and the have yet to respond. I am going back to get a refund."
1,Terrible!,"This product should not be on the market. The sound quality is amazingly low. I would compare it to the quality of sound you get from airplane headphones - with the sound of the airplane thrown in, too! Topping it off is the very worst mechanism for saving and retrieving station presets I have ever seen - totally unintuitive and virtually unusable."
2,"Great for 2 years, then stinks","We bought one of these in 2002. It worked great until we had it for two years. At that point, the radio started to fail. It doesn't tune the FM stations to ""Stereo"" correctly and sounds like the radio is inside a wind tunnel on both FM and AM."
1,read this before you buy,"I recently bought this item through Amazon.com and wish I hadn't. The radio reception on mine is terrible. I admit that before buying I read a couple of reviews complaining about the reception, but thought with the GE name it was worth a chance. Big mistake.The reception I get on a ...cheapie radio I bought at a Dollar Store puts this dog to shame. If the radio feature is a consideration recommend you shop elsewhere, unless you like aggrevation.Too bad since it is a nice concept."
1,Terrible radio - look elsewhere!,"I have just recently taken this item out of my kitchen after years of displeasure. The sound quality is terrible. The volume mysteriously turns down on the radio and the only way to fix it is to either turn up the volume (and then get blasted away when the volume unexpectly increases!) or turn off/on the radio. This technique only works occasionally. Also, this player will not play any CD's that you have burned yourself. All-in-all, I would not recommend this radio to anyone."
4,Percussive Dishes,"Quality product, but don't install directly under the cabinet where you store the dishes, or the vibration will rattle your dishes, adding unintended percussion to the music."
3,"Good sound, easy install, not a great fringe area radio","I bought and installed this unit for my wife and we still use it. Sound is good. If you live where radio signals are strong, the radio will work ok, We live a fringe area and manage several strong stations (some without fully quieted FM reception). The unit works. I haven't read the manual on how the search rev/fwd buttons work on the remote ... the symbology is two triangles with a bound vertical line which should mean search reverse or forward to next track boundary but more often it seems to work as an incremental search making the chipmunk sound as it parses through intra-track material. CD transport seems solid. Good luck."
5,kick butt music,"this is about as high energy as a trio could get. But it's a lot more than just noise: excellent guitar work, solid vocals. not dinner-time music. but if you want music that will blow the roof off your head, this could be it."
3,really love a slide guitar,"I absolutely love this cd - it rocks and is fun - however - I wish I had known there is a ""recording/producibility"" problem, MY copy will only play in vechile cd players, NOT on my cd player in home. I emailed the ""recording studio"" and got a bunch of tripe (after a 3 week wait) I noticed that Sonny doesn't have them recording the newer albums - bummer I can't listen in home - but really enjoy it when I'm ""on the road"""
3,Maybe 3 1/2,"Not a bad CD. Sonny has played in the DC area and I keep missing the show because of work. I wish I did not have to pay bills, keep a roof over my head and... I preferred the instrumentals on this CD. His voice is not bad. Yet it almost has a country flair, which is simply not my cup of tea. Also I feel that the guitar work is a notch or two higher on the instrumentals. The music reminds me of Joe Bonamassa. The Guitar itself does vary from Joe's. Not being a guitarist, or one that knows enough about the instrument, I am unable to state the specific differences. Worth getting if you like those that sit on the fence between Rock and Blues."
2,Grant Street,"I found this album to be pretty repetitive. The third cut has a crisp, rocking beat and the last one is a nice embellishment of his somewhat hit tune Congo Square."
2,Speed isn't everything,"It should be said that Sonny Landreth is blindingly fast on guitar. Yet, after trying to like this album for more than a week, I just do not. And the reason is that my ears detect no soul at all in his playing. I am reminded of several other virtuoso guitarists (Walter Trout and Johnny Winter most specifically) who make an awful lot of noise, but very little listenable music. I am also missing entirely the Blues aspect of this recording. It's rock-and-roll. A little more attention to melody and continuity, and less fret-finger acrobatics, would help a lot."
3,Shallow breathing,"PP produce engaging House-styled off-ramps, but rarely exceed at wholly enveloping compositions, only truly accelerating on the final track."
2,quirky,"I've been waiting for farscape to pick up this season, and (for me alone apparently) it's only gotten worse. I'm kind of shocked that other reviewers are dishing five stars so liberally. I thought these were all pretty boring. These (4) stories have potential at times and do manage to tickle you with an oddity here and there, humor as well, but it's too slow and a little lacking in the entertainment vector (and I really hate Dargo's new 'softer side'). Shamefully, I admit the primary reason I don't like these episodes is the lack of space scenery or battles. Not many special effects and locations are a little average and low budge. As always of course, the animatronics are top notch. Reviewers really seem to be taken with these 4 episodes though, so maybe it's just me."
1,Sci fi finally had the wisdom to cancell this garbage,How this travesty survived 4 season and gathered a fan base is well beyound me. Bad acting and poor writting mar this badly thought out attempt at serious science fiction. Just terrible
3,Canopy module is large,The canopy module can be very difficult to install. Make sure there is PLENTY of space in your fan's canopy before you purchase.
4,Films in this set.,Here's a list of the films in this set:THE STRANGER (Orson Welles)THE GREEN GLOVE (Glenn Ford)HE WALKED BY NIGHT (Richard Basehart)CALL IT MURDER (Humphrey Bogart)THE HITCH-HIKER (Edmond O'Brien)D.O.A. (Edmond O'Brien)DETOUR (Tom Neal)THE BIG COMBO (Cornel Wilde)SCARLET STREET (Edward G. Robinson)THE HOODLUM (Lawrence Tierney)I don't know about audio and video quality.
4,Review - Steven Anello,"A rather informative book that could have delved deeper into some of the issues. Although the book was fairly comprehensive in its coverage of the subject matter, I was left feeling that it could have taken ideas just a little further to their logical conclusions.Steven Anello"
2,Buy Buffettology Instead,This book was rather weak. It touched on alot of interesting topics but often didn't dive into them in detail. It also had interviews with at least 3 people who run mutual and hedge funds that didn't have much to do with Buffett's record itself.I've read just about all of the books on Buffett out there and this one was not one of the best by far. Buy Buffettology or the New Buffettology. They are far better.
2,Below Average,Very superficial treatment of most topics but the book does make you think! (especially the interview with Pabrai)...
1,"Good songs, bad package.","Great White is a great rock n'roll band and their covers of Zep and others ARE worth checking out, but these tracks are available on two seperate discs already making this release needless, as well as in bad taste with the cover (which Amazon says is not an available image), and questionable. The band, and those who lost their lives in Rhode Island deserve better. There are other questionable releases the band is fighting against, so check out their official website before purchasing anything."
1,Statement Regarding New Release From Cleopatra/Deadline Reco,"Statement Regarding New Release From Cleopatra/Deadline Records Called Double DosePosted April 28, 2004 on www.mistabone.comToday we were horrified to discover that once again another record company has attempted to profit on the horrible tragedy of February 20th , 2003. Deadline / Cleopatra Records has planned to release a double record called Double Dose on May 11th with a burning shark on the cover. This is a reprehensible and deplorable act for the sole purpose of financial gain.Great White is disgusted by the cover, and certainly did not approve it or the album's release. This practice of repackaging for profit will not be tolerated. The disgusting and vile album cover is a disgrace. We are demanding the immediate cancellation of this release and are taking all legal avenues available to stop it. We are contacting Navarre distribution as well as Deadline Records today."
4,Great value!,"After I received the shipment, I found out that the battery packs are Nicads and not the NiMH that Cobra sells, which means that don't last as long per charge. None the less, this combo pack offers good value for the money.I use them around the house as intercoms so I don't have to yell at my daughters anymore. They are also great on camping trips. I guess the airwave up here in Canada is not as saturated, because I haven't had any problem finding a clear channel amongst the 14 available."
3,Great frs set for the price.,"Bought this set to use for various things (fairs, boating, camping, around the home, etc..) Great thing was that it came all as one package. Battery packs, clips, charger. Everything I could think of was there. I put these little things to the test and was amazed at the range. In the city was 1 or so miles depending on terrain. Tried it over water and was amassed again at the mile or 2 range. I decided to put it to the last and final test. I took them to the fair where I found out that everyone had them. This pair DOES NOT have the digital sub codes so I heard everyone there. This made the set useless because it was basically a giant party line. Not only could the other person hear what we were saying but so did anyone at the fair. Overall, good units for home, school, camping, hiking. But if your considering using FRS in a large public place consider spending the extra money and getting the digital sub-codes for added security."
1,need to step up!,"If you are looking for FRS 2-way radio, consider models with 14x38 channels as air is saturated with users in areas where you gonna use it -- ski slops, ships, parks etc. 14 channels doesn't give enough options, so with this radio you will listen to conversations of others!To consider: 1) compact audiovox model with 14x38 channels 2) higher end Cobra with 14x38"
5,On Human Life,"""Humanae Vitae"" cuts through all of the jargon, hearsay, and soundbites to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the Roman Catholic church's teaching on artificial birth control. Paul VI masterfuly explains the beauty of married love and its reflection of Divine love. In addition he clarifies many other related issues, such as natural family planning and the role of children in a couples' life. I also find interesting the prophetic nature of this encyclical. It is amazing to see that Pope Paul VI realized that artifical birth control would actually diminish society's respect for sex, rather than increase it. This book is a true eye opener and I strongly recomend Humanae Vitae to all."
2,LOOK AT THE COVER ART,"I dont'know why Davies and Hodgson always sung like girls with tiny voices.... Anyway, BREAKFAST is so pop, it almost made me puke... IT's a best seeling album (mere than thirteen million copies sold) but is nowhere closer to CRIME OF THE CENTURY!!! Slip it !!!"
1,out in the sun too long,"too much California sun had fried their creativity while they recorded this!It is shallow, weak, derivitive and a long way below the creative genius they displayed on Crime of the Century (their only album worth having)The irony is their commercial success was inversely related to their musical peak."
1,unknown,"I never received the CD as it was sent to the wrong addy. I'm sure it is spectacular though. I did get my $$ refunded after I e-mailed Amazon to tell them that I didn't get what I ordered, and I have ordered other items which have come to me in a timely manner. Thanks Amazon!! Love ya, T-"
4,The 70's Theme Songs in One Package,"Music has always represented time travel to me in a way. When I hear certain songs from my past now, the song will turn on the projector inside my head and visions will appear. When I hear this CD, I get so many flashes of the 70's. The great part of this experience is good songs always bring back good memories. Breakfast In America plays one great memory after another for me and I hope you can tap into some wonderful memories listening to some of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson's best work. this very well could be this duo's best collaberation."
1,IT'S NOT REMASTERED !,"This production is not remastered and sound exactly as the first printof A&M; (1990). The current ""remastered"" version is far away better.I don't belive that it is a new coming out in Japan even if it's said to be 2005.Don't spend any money on this limited japanese CD you will be disapointed. The quallity of the sound is simply not there."
2,Great album but this remaster is an insult!,"To make a long story short, if you want a great sounding version of this, seek out the Mofi Gold version. That version sounds absolutely incredible with a super-smooth high-end, punchy bass, and incredible dynamics. This version has a very harsh high-end, muddy bass, and is compressed beyond belief. Use the title track and compare both versions above; you will not believe how lame this remaster is. The EITQM remaster is even worse! (Strangely, the ""Crisis? What Crisis?"" remaster was acutally very well done!) If you like recordings whose dynamics have been chopped off at the knees or will solely be playing it through a boom box, by all means order this CD. Audiophiles need not apply..."
4,Prog Rock Guru says: Pop oriented with excellent moments!,"A classic Supertramp. Probably the one with most well known tunes (The Logical Song, Breakfast in America). As usual with Supertramp, the Roger Hodgson tracks are more pop oriented (particularly in this album) and the Rick Davies ones are more jazzy/bluessy both with a progressive feel. Do not expect progressive epics as in previous albums. A must have for Prog Rock fans and also for music lovers in general.Hidden masterpiece: Track 8 - Just Another Nervous Wreck"
1,Botched Remaster,"I have over 2000 CDs in my collection, and I'm always thrilled to discover remastered versions of CDs that I dearly love. I've generally found remastered versions to at least offer a slight improvement to the sound, but this release is different. It is the first remaster I've purchased to make the sound worse - much worse. The sound is harsh, brittle, and very compressed. Fortunately I also have a Mobile Fidelity copy, but I was hoping for an improvement over that with all of the major advances in mastering technology that have occurred over the last several years. If you have a typical audio system, and are just interested in casual listening, it won't be a problem - just turn down the treble. But if you have spent a considerable amount of money on your system, and you seek out improved versions of CDs you already own, this isn't your bus."
2,A big disappointment!,"The music on the album is great.There's no question about it.However,the album presents two problems:The jacket was tore apart in one side and the other one was the vinyl itself. The vinyl was very dirty with some stains on it. A bad pressing I think.I had to reattach the jacket with some glue and clean up the record.Despite doing all of this.The vinyl had many pops and clicks.I had to sell the album and buy another one in a local store.This one was much better.I don't know what's happening with the US pressings.The same happened with the Beatles Vinyl box set 2012(this item wasn't bought on Amazon),but It's somethig it's happening."
2,Deluxe Edition: Audiophiles Need Not Apply,"I had high hopes for this release since I've had very good luck with all of Universal's other Deluxe Editions, but unfortunately, this one ended that win streak. This version is overly bright and suffers from digititis, much like the previous remaster, but not quite as severe.If you already own a previous version and are simply looking for an upgrade in sound, I can see no reason for you to spend your good money on this since you already own something that sounds similar to (2002 remaster) or better than (MFSL or the original CD version) this release. The original CD release, and especially the MFSL version, are vastly superior to this - pretty disappointing since even the reining champ, the MFSL release, sounds like it could be significantly improved upon. Maybe next time..."
1,Waiting for TRUE quality....... an SACD,"I just don't understand why record companies release CD after CD calling them new and improved. CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it. All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact. It's still low-resolution 16 bit old technology.I don't see why they don't release a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery. It's phenomenal and a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition""."
5,kids songs,"supertramp writes songs that sound like the whinings of a bunch of 5-year olds, not pre-teens, five year olds. damn these tunes are sweet. we sang this song in 5th grade chorus last year."
5,Good stuff!!!!,"Being an avid radio listener to classic rock stations when I was a teenager, I would always hear deejays play songs by Supertramp. I happened upon ""Breakfast In America"" and was in tears of joy, because half of the songs I had heard on the radio were on this CD. However, it is the obscure songs that makes this album incredible. ""Oh Darling"" is a catchy tune (Davies and Hodgson's dual vocals sound great together), and ""Lord Is It Mine"" is a beautiful lullaby-like song. But ""Child Of Vision"" is perhaps the greatest song on this CD. The last three-and-a-half minutes of the song displays some heavy, phenomenal piano work that I could listen to for hours. Check out this album....you won't be disappointed!"
5,TASTY BREAKFAST ENTREE,"In all actuality, BREAKFAST IN AMERICA is probably one of the best albums of the seventies. SUPERTRAMP employs all of the ingredients that eventually led to their biggest commercial success: witty, often contemplative, lyrics; strong creative melodies, eccentricity, theatrics and pure exhilaration.Their 4 hit singles speak for themselves: the pleading request of the marvelous LOGICAL SONG; the passionate fervor of GOODBYE STRANGER with its guitar driven outro that's mindblowing; the harmonica presence of the irresistible TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME and the gentle satire of the bouncy BREAKFAST IN AMERICA. The remaining tracks are all prime SUPERTRAMP but the album peaks with the purely exuberant CHILD OF VISION. With its gorgeous chord changes, layered vocals and the remarkable piano playing of Rodger Hodgson, this is progressive rock at its finest.SUPERTRAMP sadly never reached this level again, but this album will remain as one of the decade's most important albums."
4,Can't Go Wrong,"This is Supertramp's biggest-selling record, with the hits ""Take the Long Way Home"" and ""Logical Song"". Its a little less progressive than their earlier albums, and a little more focused. Good instrumentation at times, with two keyboards, woodwinds, drums, bass, glockenspiel and didjarridoo."
1,I'd rather wait for Dinner!,"Definitive album? Yes! Worth the ""upgade?"" No. I am so tired of the record companies releasing ""deluxe editions"" when they are anything but deluxe. In the case of Breakfast in America, you are paying for an overly processed ""remaster"" with a live album of material that has nothing to do with this album in a direct fashion. This is a way to sell a live album on the back of a classic album. Marketing ploy galore! How about giving us alternate takes, instrumentals, demos?"
5,Breakfast In America,"This album is just classic. Supertramp was never really my cup of tea until I heard this album. So, this album is just amazing. I would say it's their best, but I haven't heard of their other albums. Song Highlights: Gone Hollywood, The Logical Song, Goodbye Stranger, Breakfast In America, Oh Darling, Take The Long Way Home, Just Another Nervous Wreck, Casual Conversation, and Child Of Vision!"
5,Such a Super Awesome Album - Beginning to End,"You can't go wrong with your decision to buy this album, it is good the first time and then it is great thereon out. A must have for any, and I mean any, music collection."
5,1979,"If this c.d. doesn't make you wish it was 1979 again nothing will. What a classic with every cut a winner. Favorites are ""Take the Long Way Home, Logical Song, Goodbye Stranger, and Just Another Nervous Wreck""."
5,Great,Anyone who's a fan of Clamp must own. The mystery deepens in book three and only makes you want book four even faster.
2,Not what I expected,"While the item got here faster than any of the other items I purchased simultaneously, I was misled as to the condition of the product. It had been deemed ""used"" but not ""covered in stickers (inside and out), bent covers, written in and in pretty poor condition."" I had no idea that the book seemed to have been a library book of some sort and was expecting it to be in much better condition than it was.That being said, it was speedy delivery, I had no problems with the sender and even though there were stickers on the inside, none were covering print. There was also no missing pages which is really good, otherwise I would have definitely sent it back."
5,An exceptional language learning tool for kids!,This CD is a must for all parents and teachers who want to teach their little ones Spanish or English. The songs are easy to follow and it is amazing how quickly the kids memorize the catchy tunes and are singing along. I highly recommend it!
4,An enjoyable 3 hours of vintage game shows!,"This was such a window into the world of the 1950s and 60s! This DVD contains one episode each of The Celebrity Game (hosted by Carl Reiner 1964-65), Name That Tune (1953-1959), Masquerade Party (1952-1960), Beat the Clock (1950-1958), and two episodes of Do You Trust Your Wife (hosted by Edgar Bergen 1956-1963). It was great to see shows that you would never find elsewhere, along with the original commercials. Only Beat the Clock has been shown on GSN. What a hoot! Just wish there were more like this!"
1,don't waste your money,"As typical as other new generation of Chinese popular writers nowadays, this's a tasteless so-call semi-autobiography, full of self worshiping, and it's shallow to the point of laughtable. Not to mention very poor writing skill and story telling. Reading along, none the characters seems to gain your sympathy, until you couldn't careless about how their fate develop..."
2,"Wei Hui, the Smart and Beautiful","This book gave a headache for me. Especially when this Coco adores herself too much. As the story moves further this young lady shows more and more of her fineness. She's beautiful, independent, smart, lenglei, fashion-wise, open, different, controversial, lovable and sexy. The most irritating of all is when this `very fine young lady' conducted a game of poem and flowers in her party. Flowers for the most beautiful and poem for the smartest. You guessed it right! She got so many of both. How pathetic.After all, this overly light novel is smartly written to welcome outburst of controversy in China. I recommend this book for Malaysians and fellow Asians (this is an example of a minor Asian's true lifestyle) and just forget this if you're Westerners finding the unique way of Asian life."
3,This was a love story - why the backlash?,"I picked this book up because of it's notoriety of being banned China. I was expecting some scintillating stuff; but it didn't happen; although the story was well worth reading. What I learned about banning books in China is this; China needs more problems to worry about than a fresh story of a modern couple.Coco is a young, educated writer from a supportive family. She meets and falls desperatly in love with Tian-Tian. She moves in with him regardless of her parents' unaproving stance... but she stands up as a modern woman in modern day Shanghai.The story revolves around Coco's life; her writing, her tremendous yet torcherous love for the impotent Tian-Tain, and her pull for her 'Western' German lover who fulfills her every physical need.All in all this was a great story full of real life stuff; and the bonus is that it is from a country we cannot understand (Communist China) and yet it is a story we can all relate to."
2,simple and not interesting,"The only interesting fact in this book is that was forbidden by the chinese government, so the advertisers didnt lose any time writing it in the first page...Anyway the book is simple written and talks about a China that is not real. I lived in Beijing for about a year and a half and i can say that the superfluous and plastic life that Coco lives in this book does not show at all the reality of China. In fact the only thing she talks about is going out to fancy restaurants, listening to western rock-bands, and wearing designer clothes...She ends up going out with a westerner, married, rich, and with a big d..k.To sumarize: boring, predictive, simple written... And again the biggest marketing thing they got is that it was forbidden in China...Oky"
2,Almost a TORTURE to read,"I found this book hidden in my basement. The book started badly and ended even worse. As I was reading, I kept wishing that it would get better but it never did. However, this is a good book for quick reading on the subway or bus. It is extremely shallow and does not require much thinking. It reminds me of a poorly written Harlequin. In fact, some Harlequins may even be better.The author attempts to tackle modern day issues but failed miserably. Her views in life is limited and unrealistic. The characters lacked depth - every character was vain and sex crazed. Her constant description of how beautiful the heroin was and the tight clothing she wore got annoying. The sex scenes are repetitive to an extent where it appears that the same words are used. The setting of Shanghai appears to be irrelevant and misrepresented in many ways.I give this book 2 stars. Why? I made it through the book and got a party idea from it."
4,Enjoyable,"I found it to be a pretty light read, and buzzed through it quickly. It's not deep and meaningful, but it is an interesting story about a life in Shanghai. I found it similar to books I used to have to read for English class, but much more enjoyable."
3,"Slow at first, but surprisingly good","It started off very slow, and after the first 2 chapters I put it down and did not read it again for about a month. There was just a lot of background information in the beginning which made it... well... boring. However, the plot thickens substantially towards the middle of the book, after she sleeps with Mark for the first time. After this moment, the story moves and becomes surprisingly quite good.The novel is insightful on many levels. It has a lot of truths about contemporary Chinese society, and at the same time she also illustrates the human truths about the characters. She did a terrific job of bringing out the inner secret motivations and conflicts/hypocracies.I am glad that we have this kind of story coming out of China. It's modern, refreshing, and a bit feminist. It's also quite original. It's certainly not the stereotypical literature from Chinese female writers."
1,"exaggerated, just try to make herself standout. don't buy it",I also read the chinese version of this book. is it a literature? definitely not in chinese. I just feel the author is getting the stories from Penthouse or playboy and bundled with a little thing about Shanghai.The story itself is neither interesting or surprising. She tried to make the contrast of having a loved one who have problem in sex and another German who can satisfied her in sex. I'd say this is a BAD book and not worth to read at all.
2,no genius here,"drug-glorifying, pseudo-intellectual, narcissistic crap with little or no depth. the author goes into unnecessary detail about her 'wet spots' and her perverse sexual desires probably in an attempt to be provocative, fresh or insightful. whichever, it didn't work for me. although desperately trying to be one, this author is not a genius. there are a few passages where the rays of truth fight their ways through thick clouds of the inflated image of a meaningless, artsy fartsy wannabe philosophical shanghai subculture. hence two stars."
2,Self Obessed and Stupid,"The book is full of depressing lives filled with lust, and nothing else.But what is the point? That some people in the material Shanghai are just empty inside? That sex is everything they have to fill the holes and emptiness?Credit given to the hot sex scenes, but these alone does not make a good book.And it is a shame that its ban in China (as you can imagine its negative influence on teenagers) has been used as a marketing tool to promote it in the West.Lucy Chen"
2,"Disappointing read, had some poetic phrases","This was a rather disappointing read, I enjoyed her writing style but it went into way too many descriptions, and I was more interested to see how the dialogue & the story will develop. The characters were well described and introduced, but nothing much really happened to them. The references to Tian Tian's upcoming death took away any thrill that would have caused, so the surprise was taken away. The encounters with her lover were not bad, the story was just not going anywhere. References to feminisim were weak and did not mkae for a good argument. I sadly do not recommend this book."
2,not recommended,"i work at an independent bookstore and this caught my eye. however, as soon i started to read it, it became clear to me that this book book is badly written. it's obtuse, with unbelievable characters. the protagonist is unusual at best, and the plot is just not engaging. i exchanged it the next day for something else"
4,Beautiful writing,"I was surprised to see such low ratings for the book. I found her writing style quite hypnotizing and read the book very quickly. I admire how autobiographical it seems, because I enjoy reading true emotions and thoughts. I guess I hadn't heard about it before I read it, so I wasn't expecting any controversy or for it to be representative of China. I just think it's an interesting and relatable story about a young woman and inspirational to aspiring writers."
2,Not Very Good,"As an 1980's western punker/artist ( in the U.S.) of of Asian origins, I am just amazed by the clueless comments made by some reviewers who don't have a clue about a country and base their knowledge of a country on a self serving author who plays you into the age old stereotypes of East and West, this time magnified 100 fold (e.g. impotent male vs verile male). Because it was banned , the marketing hype calls the book ""real China of today"" and cool, and it represents modern China. You almost feel from the raving reviews that there is this great movement and turmoil and as if every one in Coco's age is like her. Perhaps you should see how the young really live in China, just like how the world perceives America vs how we really are. Good grief! The writing is hollow and hard to sympathize when one really knows what is happening in China. You would figure us to be more sophisticated."
1,the worst book I had read.,"This book is the worst book that published in US I had read.I am so disppointed American publishers' tastes. I am worry about this book gave American reader a wrong feeling on Chinese life and Chinese women, especially the people never visit China before."
1,Typical boring PI tale,An oversized female Manhattan PI investigates the murder of a reclusive old lady.Typical smart-mouth PI-type narrating a boring story in what she thinks is a cute way. Another piece of evidence for my theory that a clever title means the author has used up her quota and the story itself will lack any interest.
3,Okay,"Desiree Shapiro, plus-size private eye extraordinaire, is visiting her niece, when a murder takes place in the building. Desiree is immediatley called on to protect a young grocery delivery boy from being charged with the murder. Soon on there's another murder in the same building, and Desiree feels her detective work is getting her nowhere. Until she finally gets what she thinks is a lead, and turns out to be wrong.Overall, this book was somewhat of a disappointment. Desiree is a likeable character, but the amount of relationships, characters, and situations, went a little overboard. I recommend this book to someone who is looking for a light mystery."
2,A Disapppointment,"Desiree Shapiro is a full figured private eye living and working in New York City who usually handles fraud and domestic cases. One day, there in a murder in her niece's apartment building. She is asked to clear the grocery boy accused of the murder, but then another murder takes place. Are the two connected? And what can she do about her attraction to one of the suspects?I started out liking the book. I found the humor fun and the character likable. But the plot was boring. I figured out a key plot point chapters before Desiree did. There is a subplot concerning a friend's husband that adds nothing but pages to the story. The plot advances very little until the climax is reached.I was disappointed I wasted my time with this book. It is a great character destroyed by a weak plot."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of mysteries with women heroines and I was excited when I discovered one to be a bit overwieght. I was highly disappointed with the writing and the plot was predicatble. Also, you felt cheated with the ""spin"" the author tried to put on it. It was one of those books where the main character seems to draw her conclusions out of no where and solve the mystery. Also, the fact that she wrote out the accents extremely heavy annoyed me. It's okay to imply that there's a heavy accent, but to write it out so unclear that you have to go back and reread to get the gist of what the person is saying is annoying. We get the point, the character has an strong accent."
2,Looks are deceiving!,"This is a beautiful watch but after having it for two weeks the watch broke, the minute hand just hung there and then the watch stopped...after just two weeks! I was able to return it for a full refund and as I was returning it I overheard the sales clerk say that was the second one to be returned recently for the same problem."
4,"pretty, jangly, skillful instrumentals","it's lovely 12-string finger-picking goodness.It lacks any of Fahey's inspired madness, but could be a nice addition to any Kottke, folk, or bluegrass aficianado's collection."
4,Williams makes this oldies collection something special.,"Director Barry Levinson seems to have a knack for picking popular songs that truly add to his films (see RAIN MAN and DINER for more proof). This collection, chock full of great oldies like I GET AROUND, FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD, and WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD, is made even better by the often humorous dialogue (spoken by Robin Williams) interspersed throughout. This is one of Williams' better performances and this disc gives fans a funny and sometimes touching reminder of his unique talent."
2,"Great film, average soundtrack","If you're a fan of this movie, I suggest you buy the film, don't be tempted to buy the soundtrack. To be fair, there are some good songs on the CD but most lose their listening appeal very quickly. The Robbin Williams audio clips are good, but again, if you're a fan of Robin, you should buy one of his many films or some of his standup material tapes/videos."
3,Three Stars For The Songs And No Stars For Robin Williams.,"I have not seen the film, but decided to investigate the soundtrack.I am rewarded with some excellent 1960s music, for example Sugar And Spice from The Searchers, What A Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong and The Beach Boy's The Warmth Of The Sun.Best of all is Five O'Clock World from The Vogues, great song.The problem is with Robin Williams DJ impressions, they really grate on me!So if you are happy with the DJ input, this is well worth hearing, if not try before you buy!"
3,"Good Songs, Poor Sound Quality",I bought this because I loved the movie. I like the songs and the comedy interspersed is OK. The sound quality is quite poor though.
4,Good Morning Vietnam Soundtrack,"Robin Williams is at his best as a ""DJ"". If you like oldies, you will like this CD. Fairly good mixture of songs."
5,Robin WILLIAMS at HIS BEST in the '80s!!!!!!,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD MORNIN' VIETNAAAAAAAAM!!!!!!!!!!NEED I SAY MORE?
4,Good Tunes!,"A good soundtrack with some of Robin Williams' manic commentary thrown in for laughs. My fav tune: The Vogues ""Five O'Clock World"" - not because of the Drew Carey Show - but rather because it was good music from local guys who made it big.If you buy this soundtrack, you won't be disappointed."
1,the very worst of quality,"the tone quality of this c.d. is just short of horriblethis was supposed to be the orginal sound track, if so I am disappointed"
4,AMAZING shoes!,"These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I own. The only advice to future buyers is to go half size smaller than you think your true shoe size is. The shoes are slightly big and mold to your feet....this means the stretch out to a comfortable fit if you order them a half size small. Overall, I would definitely buy these shoes again."
4,Cute/Squeaky,"I bought these a few months ago in blue. They're very cute and comfy, but definitely run large- ordered a 6 for my normally size 6.5 foot and they're more than spacious enough for a thick pair of socks (though I usually wear them without socks). They're very well made, I'm betting on having them for years to come.One downside: When I first got them, they would SQUEAK. LOUDLY. I'm a very quiet person (ninja?), so this bothered me. Luckily, after wearing them for a while (maybe 4-5 8 hour days)- they've silenced almost completely. I'd suggest new owners fight their urge to be careful with their new shoes and take their mocs for a stroll in the grass/gravel/dirt/etc. Seems like the muck from the ground helps to temper the squeaky plastic.I've had to walk through wet grass a couple of times with them... they fared great- no water marks or signs of damage. Overall, they're a great buy."
1,Be very careful. These are not all as pictured,"Be very careful ordering these shoes! Some of them are not as pictured! Most pictures show a rubber sole. I ordered one where no sole was shown (only the top of the shoe was shown...which excluded showing that no sole was included on this particular pair). Very deceptive and I'm pretty mad about it. If one of the shoe options is not the same as the others shown in the options then hiding the difference is dishonest. I've applied for ""approval"" to return these shoes but have not yet received it.Buyer beware (and seller, if you're offering a different version of these shoes hiding the difference is deceptive and only leads to bad reviews and not happy customers)."
2,comfortable but not great quality,"I've had these shoes for about 4 months now. I have these in black and they are cute and for the most part comfortable. The price is also very good.But I give these 2 stars because the cons way outweigh the pros.The cons: The string ties drive me nuts. I tie them and they come undone within 3 minutes and I constantly have to retie the strings. I've double knotted them and they still come undone. I have to be extra careful on escalators so that the strings don't get caught. I've contemplated super glueing the strings but I haven't gotten around to it. And I really shouldn't have to do that with a pair of shoes.Also, the sole at the toe has come unglued and so now there is a slight flapping noise when I wear them.The sole I can deal with, but seriously, the string ties are too annoying."
5,Love these shoes!,"You can't bet Minnetonka shoes for comfort... the company has been well known forever for this! Also, this color (sort of a muted blue/gray) goes so well with jeans, too!"
4,"Minnetonka women's 403 Kitty Moccasin, dusty brown, 9M US","Very nice shoes; unfortunately, they didn't fit, were returned, and there were none in the correct size available. Very good service from the company."
5,Great slipper/shoe,I recently had a hip replacement and could not bend over to tie shoes. I got these for the hospital so I would have a slipper and shoe in one for walking with the physical therapist. I could wear them around the house all day because they are so comfortable. But they also have a solid sole for wearing outside.
5,Comfortable and trendy,Love these. I am feel comfortable but not be in sneakers. Down side I wore them fr a long walk and my ankles hurt after. Best as an errands shoe and not toouch more.
3,Pink off color,"I ordered the pink shoes which look pale pink in the picture but are actually closer to hot pink in person.Otherwise stylish, comfortable and affordable."
4,"Minnetonka Kilty Moccasin,Pink,8 M","Super comfy even for a wide feet, but the color is nothing like what you see here...the photo shows a pretty baby pink, but the pink I received is more of a coral, rich pink...I usually wears 8.5, size 8 fits nicely for me."
5,good,"I loved the shoe. They go with a lot of my outfits and they are very comfortable. so,it is great for my feet!"
4,Check the bottoms,"In general, I love these shoes . The only disappointment is that I thought I was ordering the same Kilty as my brown pair. However, those have a continuous piece of smooth leather inside the base of the shoe. This has two pieces sewn/glued in. You can feel the seems a little, especially the edges by your toes. The leather is adjusting to my feet with time, but these are not quite the perfect comfort shoes of my other pair."
1,"disapointed, wrong shoes","I was sent a pair of soft sole moccasins. The top of the shoe looks very cute but I can not ever wear these outside so whats the point, I didn't buy slippers. The description and picture of the shoes, in all colors, shows a rubber sole. I'm really dissapointed since I had to return. Please correct your site and descriptions, very misleading."
3,Pink? Maybe for the color blind,"I got this item in pink, But the pink listed for this item is a vibrant pink as pictured. The item I got was a very very light almost skin colored pink, lighter then baby pink even. Not at all what I was expecting. Also this shoe is surprisingly pointy toed. I expected a classic blunt rounded toe you would expect from a pair of mocs.But it seems like these are more modeled after a slightly more angular toe of a boat shoe. Not really flattering on these for anyone under the age of 50."
5,Love these!,"I love, love, love these moccasins! They are so comfortable and have perfect for all seasons. I got the pink, which does show dirt more easily, but I would definitely order Minnetonka Moccasins again. They are a great price and so comfortable."
4,Cute,"These shoes fit big! I normally wear a size 7 in Women's shoes, but I should have gotten a 6.5. They are comfortable but the strings will NOT STAY TIED, which is very annoying at time so I tuck them in."
5,Comfy,"Have several pairs of Minnetonka mocs which are wearing out - very comfortable, like being barefoot. These were a very satisfactory replacement for my very worn old black pair. The only caveat is that any kind of mocs would not be suitable for someone needing arch support. I have a very high arch, which, even with age and weight, has not, thankfully, ""fallen"" or otherwise given me pain. As I age, I am less fashion conscious and more comfort conscious, and much prefer these ""barefoot wonders"" to the ""old lady shoes"" that I might otherwise be forced into. But the Minnetonkas look good with casual outfits."
5,Absolutely perfect!,Absolutely perfect! It's so confortable that like walking without any shoes.I will buy some more again! ha ha ha
5,Comfy slippers,"These mocs are. nice to wear around the house. I ordered a half size down as other reviews suggested that I do. They fit just fine! I would not wear them on the street as there is no real support to them. So, if you are looking for something to wear like slippers these fit the bill!"
4,Happy Customer,Love the shoes they came fast enough and fit perfect. Just wish I picked a different color because these get dirty reallyyyy fast !
4,Exactly as pictured,"Ordered these as casual shoes for around the office and out to the store. I ordered the medium gray. They arrive in a few days and were exactly as described and pictured. They are very comfortable. For those who haven't worn mocs before, I recommend ordering it a half size smaller than your regular size as the leather stretches. This particular style isn't as cute as some of the others but is more comfortable for me because it covers well above my toes. The one thing I can see being a problem is that the rubber soul isn't that thick so after a lot of walking your feet can hurt a little. Overall I am happy with the shoes for what I wanted."
4,Ahh~ my feet are red!,These shoes have been my favorite purchase in a long time. I bought the red ones because red is my favorite color. the only bad thing about them was the fact that when i took my foot out of them the dye had rubbed off on my feet. a Cherry popsicle was not an exciting thing for me to have as a foot.
3,mwkm,"I LOVED these shoes and was very excited to get them. The shipping was exceptionally fast. My only complaint is the sizing. I am normally a size 7, and upon reading some reviews on another website that they run a tad large I got the smallest size down they had, a 6.5. They still ran very big, even with inserts. I think I would need a 5.5. My advice is if you are able to, try these shoes on in a store first. If they are a bit tight don't fret, the suede will stretch. I don't think I could wear them out without being worried about them constantly falling off. Being a Canadian resident it wouldn't be worth the shipping costs to send them back for a refund. I can't find these anywhere! Several sites won't even ship Minnetonka to Canada anymore. :("
1,These run big and Footnation won't exchange,"Shoes are fine, look nice. Here's the rub, I bought these for my wife for Xmas not knowing that apparently they run big. She tried them on a few weeks later and they were too big. I emailed Footnation and they wouldn't exchange them for another size b/c of their 30 day return policy. Since I purchased them the beginning of Dec, by the time I gave them to her it was already 20+ days into their 30 day policy. Ridiculous. I can understand not RETURNING the shoes after 30 days but to refuse to EXCHANGE them for another size? You've got to be kidding me. In this market you would think stores would bend over backwards trying to keep customers. Wake up retail world, its no longer a booming economy! I would have purchased more shoes from them, but no thanks. I'll find a store that appreciates my business."
1,Poor Quality,"I rated these shoes one star because I just don't believe any shoe should look this beat up after 3.5 months. I have very rarely worn the shoes outside, mostly just around the house. I don't think they would exist if I ventured out in them. They look sloppy and overrun because the width has stretched so much. And, they stretched width-wise very soon after I started wearing them.I don't think anyone with a slightly narrow foot could wear these. My width is between B and C and these are probably at least a D now. Both of the ties have ripped off, and I probably only tied them a few times. They're comfortable because they're such a wreck they're barely touching my feet anymore. I need to buy new mocassins, but I definitely won't be buying these again."
5,Nice 5.5M Winter Boot,"Hard to find a winter boot in 5.5M,so I was very happy to find this boot. Keeps me warm/dry and has good traction. Zipped over my skinny jeans just fine. More of a winter boot than a true rain boot, since it has the lining. I've received many compliments when I wear them."
5,Great shoes!!!,These shoes are great. My daughter loves them. They are comfortable and were a great deal.
1,Useless shoes and bad return policy.,"I ordered 3 pairs of Moccasin shoes for family members (upon their request). However, two pair did not work out. I called to ask for their return policy. On their website, they stated that after 30 days, you will need to pay $5 for each pair to return. If in any way you damage their shoe boxes, you will need to pay another $5 for the shoe box. Please, who in the world charge people for shoe boxes???? I will NEVER shop for their shoes again. Also, they make shoes that have no soles. Who in the world wear that kind of shoes????Very bad business practice. I don't know why people give their product such good reviews. Run the other way will be my recommendation."
5,Best Moccasins EVER!,"I used to wear moccasins all the time, but for years I couldn't find them unitl I looked on Amazon! I was totally amazed to find them in my size (womens 11). I couldn't wait to get them. They fit perfect and I Love them!!"
3,Not for me,"I had to return this order. I wear an 8.5 W shoe. When they dont offer wide, I always get a 9 M. This has always worked for me, but not on this shoe. They run very narrow. I also need more support in a shoe. These felt more like slippers than shoes. I think they are very good quality. If you do not need wide and alot of support, I think you will like the shoes."
5,Women's Size 11- Right On,"I was a little worried when deciding to order these moccasins based on the reviews- everyone was saying to order a complete size down than normal. However, I am a size 11, and there were no 10s in stock. I went for the 11 anyway, relying on Amazon's amazing return policy if these weren't wearable. To my relief, the 11 was right on the money. There was no gapping or slipping when I walked, and were quite comfortable to walk in. I do recommend wearing no-show socks (the ones that barely cover your feet) to prevent any color transfer onto your feet. The brown suede color is absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend these with skinny, straight-leg, or rolled-up boot cut jeans. If I would've worn a size smaller than 11, I might have listened to the other reviewers about ordering a size down, but the 11 was an exact fit."
3,"Very cute, wrong size stated",These moccasin's are really very cute but they run much bigger than the actual size. I ordered a size 5 for my daughter and they were nearly a size 6 - 6 1/2. I had to return them because that was the smallest womens size they carried. I would purchase again but not sure how to order the next pair.
1,too big,i wore these shoes for years and now they are made very differently. too big and wide for my narrow foot.
5,i love it,These are adorable and comfortable. I just love them! Just know they are usual size . You will be so happy with them!
4,Love em-if I can get the right ones!,"I love these moccasins ( in a full size smaller than what I usually wear), but I, like other reviewers, was sent the soft sole, when this page clearly says rubber sole. It's definitely a problem that needs to be fixed. I'm returning the pair I just received, and even though I love Amazon, I will be ordering my hard soles directly from Minnetonka."
5,Very good buy,"Yay love these shoes. Very cute & comfortable :). THANK GOD i read the reviews first, they said to buy them a half size smaller or even a size smaller & i did & they fit greattttttt =] . Very pleased with my buy."
3,Not as comfy as I wanted them to be...,"I ordered these as a summer work shoe. I have some mocs now that have thick lining in them and they are just too hot to wear in the summer time. I love wearing mocs though because they are so comfy and go with pretty much any outfit. So I ordered these thinking they would be cooler and I loved the fringe detail. They are just not as comfy as my other mocs, and I don't think it is because of the lack of lining. The shoes fit fine in the length, but are tight across the top of my feet. I have flat feet so they tend to be a bit wider but usually not so much so that I need to buy a special size shoe. I am hoping that as I wear these they will loosen up!"
4,grey moccasin fits good,the grey moccasin fits good and looks good. feels sturdy on my foot would recommend for a narrow sized foot
1,Really disappointed.,I recieved the shoes promptly btu man where they in bad shape. One shoe was twice as wide as the other! Really strange.
5,yellow love,this is a great shoe - super comfy and love the pop of color on my feet. i normally wear a 9.5 and order an 8.5 and that was perfect.
5,mo thugs family,I love this CD. I used to own this when I was younger but it was misplaced with all the moving we did. I'm glad that I own it again.
2,never liked it,i never liked the family scriptures cd but i love the reunion album motherships good an the movement is good i dunno scriptures is to like girly an soft ecspecially with the time it came out which was in between east 99 and art of war when bone was comin the hardest i dunno i cant stand a cd that has a bunch of songs by girl groups on it..eriously girl groups an girl rappers. mo thugs 2 is so much better
4,Good album,"This is the album where Bone Thugs began their maturity increase, as it started their Mo Thugs Label. Though the Art of War was where they reached their all-time peak in the maturity factor this cd is the one that set it off. The talent featured on this cd is strong, especially Poetic Hustlaz and Soulja boy...Bone themselves represent on this album, though Bizzy aint on it....A must have for any bone fan. This album debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts and has sold over 3 million copies to date."
2,Didn't Work for Me,I was really excited to try this product as I have been to many doctors and have tried almost everything I could think of. I believe my headaches to be sinus related because they are in the center of my forehead just above my eyebrows and I do have alergies. The burning sensation wasn't as bad as I expected and it did seem to clear my sinuses. My nose ran and my eyes watered a little but my headache did not go away.
1,Doesn't deliver relief,"After reading the previous reviews for this product, I was excited to purchase it and feel the sinus relief and freedom from headaches it seemed to promise. I gave it a real shot (two weeks), and wanted to believe in it, but ultimately, it didn't provide any sinus clearing action or prevent headaches. Think about it, you have a headache, and shoot PEPPER EXTRACT up your nose to relieve it? I was hoping for a homeopathic solution to some painful ailments, but didn't find it here."
5,Best out there,"This is a pepper spray basically. I have had difficulty breathing through my nose for years and had thought I'd all but lost my sense of smell. This fixed it immediately. I would recommend NOT inhaling deeply as you spray it or you will be writhing, rather insert it at a slight angle, spray then lay back and let gravity do the rest. If you are willing to take pain for instant relief though...snuff away!"
4,Safe alternative to Afrin,"When it comes to head colds, especially the really bad ones when you can only breath through your mouth there's nothing more tempting than squirting some Afrin into your nose. It is a miracle drug no doubt but easily habit forming. You shouldn't use it (Afrin) for more than 3-5days max. This last cold of mine has been dragging on and after 5 days I know I need to stop with the Afrin. I tried this as an ""all natural"" alternative, let me tell ya it's not for the weak, it's like snorting Pepsi up your nose. It works well, about 75% as well as Afrin works but you can use it after you've used the Afrin for a few days. I'll try it other days too for when I have a headache or bad allergys. Good stuff overall, worth a shot."
4,Finally relief!,"I rarely post a product review. However after using Sinus Buster for over a week I'm a believer. I suffer from allergy congestion and sinus headaches which can quickly turn into a migraine. I take prescription allergy medicine but still seem to fight nasal congestion. This product clears my sinus and knocks down my sinus headaches FAST! I only have to use it once or twice a day. Sure it has a slight burning sensation but it is tolerable for the relief it provides. A few seconds of discomfort for hours of clear headache free breathing is a solid trade off for me. As with any product I'm sure nothing works for everyone. But this product works great for me. Substantially fewer headaches, clear nasal passages. AWESOME."
5,Picture is wrong,"This is the ""classic"" Sinus Buster. The Picture is of a different type. I took a chance and ordered it and got the original formula. Either one would have been OK. The stuff went up a buck since 2 days ago. Maybe it's cheaper on the weekend?This stuff won't UN-swell your sinuses but for me it does stop my nose from running like a faucet. It's also good for a sinus headache, or any headache. The first time I bought this stuff it really blew my head off with it's power, but it seems to me they have buffered the formula and it's not as strong. It still is ""exciting"" at first, but the blast subsides after 10-20 seconds. I can't live without it!"
1,Don't use it!!,"I'm surprised at all of the positive reviews on this product. I too suffer from year round allergies and I thought I would give this a try (something natural for once). I followed the directions and sprayed a little bit into each nostril, but the burning sensation was too much for me. It's like stuffing chili peppers into each nostril. That's how much it burned. My eyes have never watered so much in my life. You forget about the congestions for a moment, because it feels like your nose is on fire. I'll stick with Afrin or Zycam for nose sprays from now on."
1,Sinus Trash!,"I bought this product to maybe replace Afrin. Touted as ""All natural and It is non habit forming"" WoW! Just what I need! I couldn't wait to try it. Well it's like getting hit with Pepper Spray! I was willing to deal with that but the clearing of my sinuses was only partial and so I gave it another squirt! I must say It feels like it will work but the clearing of my sinuses was short lived and within an hour the stuffies were back. I don't have a cold or allergies. I even tried it at least 5 different nights with the same results. I just threw the rest in the trash and bought Afrin extra moisturizing which I have had Great results with.I think the good reviews are BOGUS!"
1,Does Not Work,"About the Pain - Like anything that can cause discomfort, each person's individual pain threshold will determine how something like this affects them. I probably fall some where in the middle, so the pain was definitely intense, but didn't last too long, and would have been worth it if it had done anything...About the Relief - Unfortunately, the relief was non-existent for me. Admittedly, I have chronic sinus issues, but this product did nothing at all for me. If it helped at all, it would only provide relief for a minute or two. Most often, not even that. I have tried it off and on for a month or so and have finally given up that it would ever give me any relief under any condition, even when i'm just slightly stuffy."
2,"It Did not help me get off Oxymetazoline, (common nasal spray).","I bought this hoping it would make it easier to get off of the kind of nasal spay found in any drugstore. It was no help at all for that purpose, I had to tough it out. However, after two weeks free of the Oxymetazoline nasal spray, this truly helps open my sinuses better than saline. I do like the product very much, but gave only two stars because the bottle leaks with use. It is too expensive to waste half the liquid in this way, so can't truly recommend it for that reason. Going to try a different brand next purchase."
1,Worst Product ever,I am an unlucky sufferer of pregnancy rhinitis. I get stuffed to the point of 0% air coming into my nose. Thus creating the additional issue of chapped lips and just generally looking pathetic.I am stuck though. I bought this crap in hopes that I could break my need for Afrin since Afrin is the only thing that works. Not a chance in hell.I used it while at work. I ran out - spent the $16 on the crap and to my genuinely furious surprise got a bee sting pain in my nose and my nose completely shut off all air flow.I am absolutely disappointed since I was specifically told not to use Afrin anymore but now I must suffer more.My nose looks like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and I feel like I have had Mace sprayed in my nose.BEWARE - if you have allergies this will only make them worse!!!!!
2,"It works, but not as well as Afrin","I've been using this for a week: every morning and evening (sometimes in the afternoon). I'm very sad to say that for me, this stuff does not work as quickly, easily or thoroughly as Afrin. I'm profoundly disappointed, since I don't want to go back to the Afrin, but sometimes in the middle of the night, I NEED to be able to breathe through my nose for my CPAP device.Ugh."
4,Very good product!,I have used the product for a few weeks now and find it is better at clearing out sinus's than Afrin which I have been using for a very long time. There are other products I have tried too but this pepper spray really clears sinus's faster than any other product.
1,Fire in the hole!,In my experience with this product it is just a hot poke in the nose. Did not clear my sinuses at all. Just burned like the dickens for a minute or so.
5,Sinus Buster,Use this product mostly in the winter time as i have most problems then.Does a good job. It is strong but does what it is supposed to do.
4,Control Your Expectations,"If you have a sinus condition, no simple spray is going to correct the problem. Through personal experience, I can tell you that I use Sinus Buster as a final resort when saline spray fails...not often...I do not expect this spray to be an ongoing remedy and neither should you...but as a back up when other normal steps fail, it is a nice backup."
5,Finally found relief,"I have had nose problems for years. Had surgery a couple years ago which helped a little, but still had major problems. The doc had prescribed meds costing up to $200.00 which did little. A friend showed me an article about Sinus Buster and I tried it. 90% of my problems have been cleared up. This product unlike other over the counter nasal sprays, does not end up causing swelling. The others work good for a few days and then the swelling and no more relief. It does give a little blast, but I always keep a good supply as the relief has been wonderful."
4,Ow and Wow,"I just tried this for the first time and I have to confess that it was... an experience. Frankly I've been desperate to address my sinus and allergy problems, and yet I hate medicating myself, so I needed to find some kind of happy medium.This sinus buster spray is pretty amazing. And yes, it really does sting the first time you use it, particularly if you do so right after rinsing your nose and sinuses. But I'm breathing clearly for the first time in days and don't have a lot of post-nasal drip going on. For that reason alone I consider this stuff a winner.For the rest, it's drug free, non-drowsy and non-habit forming. It contains sea salt which is a proven natural cleanser for your nose and sinuses, and aromatics to help open your sinuses and keep them unstuffed.I don't know how it'll work for the long term, but so far so good."
3,Why are you spraying hot pepper up your nose?,"Answer: Because it feels so good when I stop!I realy can't tell if this is doing anything good for me. I seem to have some very temporary relief from sinus pressure after using it. I'm beginning to think that a simple saline spray would work just as well and it wouldn't...uh....hurt. Is this spray good on tacos? In chili? In other orifices other than one's nose? Does it clean silver? Disable attackers? I think there IS potential here, I just haven't figured it out yet."
1,horrible,this product is horrible.. do not ever buy it. it does not work. it burns like hell. but will give you NO RELIEF. if you want real relief.. buy sinex by vicks. it works . doesnt burn. instant relief. DO NOT EVER BUY SINUS BUSTER
1,Absolutely useless product,"I'm not going to go into my life story here; I'm just going to be blunt and straight forward. This stuff isn't worth the powder it would take to blow it to hell! Seriously, I can't figure out how it has gotten this popular! Aside from the intense pain and momentarily disoriented feeling after this garbage hits your sinuses, it has zero effect! If you just feel like throwing away 10 - 15 bucks that's fine, but buy your self some of the real stuff too because you will need it to do what the Sinus Buster doesn't... Clear your sinuses! I'm sorry if you were looking forward to using this and not having to rely on the cycle that follows the real stuff (I was too), but it's the truth, this will do nothing but give you a short and painful burn in your nose."
2,"Good for BBQing on Ribs, Chicken or Steak!!!","I tried this stuff and it's HOT!! Hot in the nostrils, and Burns like a Hemorrhoid!! Wow!!But I did spray it on meat while I was cooking on the grill. Works Good for that!! All the meat was Spicy, and Tender, as well as Juicy. I gave it only 2 stars because I ran out of it while I was Grilling, and needed a bigger bottle! :("
5,Sinus Buster Really Works,"I just love this stuff. It takes a little getting used to, but it works better than anything I have ever used for my chronic sinus infections. My husband loves the allergy formula too."
1,Feel the Burn,"Yes, a burning sensation was expected when using this product, but it's a strong sensation. It'd be worth it if this stuff actually, you know, WORKED. Which, sadly, it did not for this consumer. Tried it on four separate occasions, no relief."
4,"Works! a little irritating, still testing it.","I checked National Institute for Health pubmed website for scientific research on 'capsaicin' and rhinitis.[...]. I get the 'rebound' effect with Afrin and I'm currently on Flonase and Astepro now. I noticed a difference after the first spray of Sinus Buster. It's a little irritating but not bad. Too soon to tell whether I can keep my swelling under control just using Sinus Buster, but I would recommend this product."
3,not bad,"I am constantly stuffy from bad sinuses, and this stuff actually works pretty well to clear it up. It burns a bit, but I think that is what actually makes it work--like eating really spicy food clears your sinuses. After a couple days use it seemed to loose some of it's effectiveness. It's like my sinuses are getting too used to it, and the stuffiness mostly comes back within the half hour.It's worth a try if your sinuses really bother you. I've not decided if I'll buy it again after this bottle is gone though."
1,"""The Pain...""","My husband bought me a bottle of this to try. I'd had a bad sinus headache for over a week and he heard a commercial on the radio for this product and figured I could give it a try. Later that night I went to use it and it HURT! (major understatement). Well, I guess my husband didn't believe me too much on how bad it was so he tried it the next night. I tried warning him but he was determined. He took it into the bathroom and I just sat there listening... then I heard it. First the spray come out of the bottle, then the scream of ""oh my God!!!"" I was rolling over laughing! But seriously, fair warning -don't touch this stuff! It really does hurt more than any nasal spray should and for me, it made me even more stuffy. The only good that came out of our experience with it is getting to read the funny reviews of others that have had the same pleasurable experience. I'm giving it one star for the entertainment value of sharing this story ;-)"
1,No relief for sinus infection or allergies,"I've tried using this for both allergy problems and for sinus infections and it did nothing. Yes - it burns so there should be some pay off for the pain, but there isn't. It didn't clear my sinuses or help with allergies. I still can't breathe so it was a waste of money for me."
4,Works great !!,"works great, keeps my sinus problems at bay....definitely keeps me from getting sinus infections when seasonal allergies hit. Although, it seems they changed the amount of pepper in this formula and it's higher in menthol.Great Product, I highly recommend this to anyone with sinus / allergy problems."
3,Good light reading,"This is a fun story like his other novels. Not monumental emotion-laden works of art, just fun reads if you have nothing else. I would recommend Dragondoom or the first two Mithgar books as his best. This one is fine but as compared to his other stuff and numerous other writers, this is worth a 3."
5,A great novel from a great novelist.,"Dennis McKiernan's Silver Wolf, Black Falcon presents a new novel of Mithgar: while familiarity with past adventures will lend to an appreciation of this, newcomers will find it easy to access this story of Bair, cursed with a prophecy which will make him Hope of the World or the bringing of chaos."
1,The same 10 to 20 pages repeated over and over for 500 pages,"Just another of the endless sagas, with much detail but little story! The characters get on their horses and off, they tie them up, talk for a while, then get on again; The author repeats this cycle over and over again with a little action thrown in every 70 pages or so! If you love minute detail and endless repetition then you'll love this book!"
2,Disappointment,"This watch was a disappointment for what you pay for it. It is hard to read at an angle, the countdown timer you would use to start a race is difficult to use and nearly inaudible. The concept behind this watch is neat, it looks nice, but Suunto should update this product and stop selling this particular watch. For a simpler, more user friendly Suunto sailing watch I recommend the M3."
4,Good Buy but be prepared!,"This is a really good watch. The features are pretty handy - barometer, temperature, can store readings, etc.The only concern is regarding the size of the watch. I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas and that was the key thing he mentioned - it is really big. So I recommend seeing it beforehand.So if you can live with the size, it's a good buy."
2,Very Unhappy with Watch,"I have been sailing for some time now and received the watch as a long awaited sailing gift.It is a little big, but I got over that very quickly. I had the watch for about 9 months and was preparing for an ocean voyage. I was looking forward to the compass feature. Two days before the voyage the compass went crazy and has not worked since.The really annoying thing about the watch is the necessity to look ""directly"" into the face. If you look at an angle, you might see any array of numbers imaginable, fives are sixes or eighths, and ones become eleven. The date 9-15 becomes 8-16. It is really maddening.I admit I haven't been back to the manufacture yet, but these problems should not occur to begin with.Be advised."
1,"Owned three, never will I own a 4th","I can't tell you how frustrated I am with this Yachtsman watch. I sail over 10,000 miles per year on average and really need to have a watch with the features that this Yachtsman provides. However, I cannot afford to keep replacing watches and bands.I have owned THREE Yachtsman's. One of these was a warranty replacement. I have four sailing friends who also bought Yachtsman because I owned one. Would you believe that all of us have had problems with this crappy watch?My third watch is now dead due to water leakage. Prior to that I have had the following problems with Yachtsman watches:* Multiple wrist band failures* Sticky buttons* LCD backlight out* Display turned black in sun light* Resetting by itself* Foggy display* Poor customer serviceI have purchased two Sunntos and I PROMISE YOU there will not be a third."
4,Suunto yachtsman review,This is the 2nd Sunnto yachtsman i have owned (lost the 1st one after several years). For sailboat racing you cannot beat the race timers as well as the compass which allows you to give a heading to a mark rather than pointing or using clock face postions. The barameter lets you know when things are building or lightening up at a glance.
2,Disappointing Sailing Watch,"Difficult to use functions. Sequences are odd and not intuitive. Barometer and compass functions are imprecise. The last straw was the battery failure, and inability for a new battery to work reliably with this watch. It is now sitting dead on the shelf.Replaced it with a Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium Stars and Stripes -- well worth the difference. Now also using a Tissot Sailing Touch, really the ultimate for a luxury sailor's timepiece."
5,Life Changing,"Denny Hinkle's book gave me back something that I'd lost. It was an understanding of my own journey, replete with valleys and peaks, many joys and many sorrows. Like Denny, I followed society's conventions, was married, and had a family. All the while, denying a very basic part of myself and my nature. When life's circumstances allowed me to begin to be exactly who I was, I found self-acceptance and self-love awaiting me. ""Burning Point"" is not easy to read. You have to stop often and look inside yourself, get in touch with your own life, and often times utter a prayer of thanks that you didn't undergo some of the family trauma that was a part of his daily existence. I raced to the end of this book and found joy...for Denny and for me. So will you. This book is written from the heart and Denny Hinkle's heart connected with my own."
5,WEST SIDE STORY BONUS,"For years I've been hoping someone would release the 15 minute West Side Story which Cher did on a pre-Oscar Dolly Parton show sometime during the 1980s. Cher plays all four leads AND all of the Jets. Well, someone did ...it's a bonus on this DVD set. I remembered being blown out of my seat when I first saw it, and hoped it would hold up to my memory of it. Which it does, in aces and spades! It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen on TV ... a true tour-de-force that left me with my jaw agape and the tears streaming down my face. Honestly ... is there anything this woman CAN'T do?"
5,"""Cher's Best Ever""","This is a dynamic DVD. Everything that Cher does is just Cher! She is beautiful in her costumes. Her songs are the ones that we have loved for years. The entire casting is special and I know if you like Cher as she appeared on TV., you are going to love this DVD. It truly is a collector's item. I purchased three: one for myself and two for gifts and the two gift recepients absolutely love this."
3,not great,"Although the DVD itself is excellent, the packaging is so not worth the near $24 I paid. It is the cheesy cardboard DVD box with the flap that doesn't stay closed. When carefully peeling off the seal, the graphics tore. Just disappointed."
1,Promo-tainment-mmercial-crass,"WOW , Ever seen poor Bob Denver sporting his GILLIGAN'S ISLAND gear at 57 ? Prepare for the musical equivalent here . Factor in the musical NECRO and ""ALLlights"" from the filmography + cirque du soleil and a non denominational band . Your getting the picture right ? Don't . Fascinating money grasp . Get the wonderful films and skip over the grift ."
3,I will not be totally negative about Cher here,"...if she promises that this will INDEED be her farewell tour. I know, blah-blah-blah, (sic) ""actress,"" ""hits thru all 4 decades of the preceeding century..."" It's all been said. Time to retire gracefully, Cher. (SEE, ****! I didn't once mention how she'd publically esmasulated the two unfortunates, her husbands, now, did I?)"
3,"Was a good show, but only good....","I really don't like to get Cher fans mad at me being one myself, but this concert was simply a repeat of the 99 Believe Tour with different costumes and a few song changes.I went to go see this show live in Toronto and it was really well done, however it was because it was live.The person who wrote the review comparing it to Madonna is sadly mistaken, all Madonna's tours are different and unique.The extra's on this DVD are alright as well, best being the 3 extra performances."
5,great show BUT!!!!,"I credited the limmted edition, at 5 stars, but to cut it short, You Cher MADONNA hater fans need to really back of Madonna. I like Cher, I stated once and I will state again Madonna put the (D) IN DIVA, No offense to cher or her die hard fans, but face it Madonna is just bigger than Cher. Its took 40 years with long gaps for cher to be where she at (NOW)since 1998. Since then she's been more popular than ever before. Madonna since 1983 has remained huge with out a dout. WHAT.."
3,Cher - The Farewell Tour,This is a good concert but is a re-hash of the previous Live Concert Tour which has a better sound track and presentation. So if you want the best then buy the other.
5,A Terrific Cher Live Concert With All The Extras,I can't believe anyone rated this concert lower than 5 stars. It is a live concert with great music and so much more. Cher does about 12 complete costume changes. There are wonderful good quality flashbacks to her performing with Sonny. There are excellent flashbacks to her best movies. The stage is filled with exciting non-stop dancing of Cher and her team. The audience is so alive - it is amazing.Live Concert (Memorial 358/9)
5,Amazing concert!!,"I saw Cher live in Calgary, AB on August 25th 2003 and it was an AMAZING show. This DVD came out the day after oddly enough, but I still picked it up. Anytime I want to relive that amazing night, I pop in the DVD and watch and remember. This show is a testament to Cher's success, and a great overview of her career. She sings all the favorites, offers some bitchy quibbles and gives overall a great show. It was pricey but worth it to see her live! It's sad to say goodbye but she's still in top form. This is a great DVD, you won't be disapointed if you love Cher. This IS Cher, everything about this show. Some of the best performances include ""Still Havent Found What I'm Looking For"", ""All Or Nothing"", ""After All"", the medleys, and more. Overall a great show you'll watch over and over!"
4,"I Ain't a Big Cher Fan, But....","...this is One Good Show. You won't be able to count the costume and wig changes, and sure, the lady don't move around as much, but she had her audience lovin' her all the way. This show proves that Celine still has a lotta work to do to get up to her stature. I dug it when she pulled out the Sonny and Cher and early Cher singles."
4,saw the show but ...,"I must say to the person who commented about Celine. Have you seen her show??? Not just what was on tv but the ENTIRE live show? Until then, you don't know what your talking about. Cher is good but Celine is better in vocal performance! Yes, Cher has great stage presence but I saw the show and it became a boreI think Cher knows when it is time to end performances. I don't think she will stop singing entirely, just touring around the world!"
3,Madonna vrs. Cher,This DVD is entertaining and worth watching. Cher does look good and her voice is better than ever. I'm tired of people comparing Madonna to Cher. Madonna is a musical genius. She had sold more albums than Cher and is the most successful female artist of all time. She also has the most number 1 songs of any female star. Cher's songs have never reached number 1 with the exception of Believe. Madonna has conquered the world.
1,CHER THE FAREWELL TOUR DVD,"THIS PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE :1. THIS PRODUCT WORKS FINE ON MY LAPTOP2. HOWEVER, WHEN I PUT INTO MY DVD PLAYER - DOES NOT WORK- THESCREEN SHOWS THIS: ""PLAYBACK PROHIBITED BY AREA LIMITATIONS.""MY PURCHASES I HAVE BOUGHT BY OTHER ARTIST CONCERTS SUCH YANNI WORK ON BOTH MY IN-HOME DVD/TV & MY LAPTOP.I WANT TO RETURN MY CHER DVD PURCHASE ... PLEASE ADVICE."
2,P.S ROD.,"Oh by the way cher paved they for DRAG QUEENS! Madonna has always been NATURALLY HERSELF open doors where women were NOT! welcome. Thats Madonna the world knows pulling stunts causing a controvesy,being provocatived OKAY kissing BRIT and CHRIS was HOT. If cher would had done it, well we wont go there. Dont hate yes a Im a BIG Madonna, that will stand UP to haters. If i make you sick thats okay too...dont be mad, dont be mad,dont me mad,dont be mad,Acknowledge it."
5,Cher - The Farewell Tour,Fantastic. This DVD should be owned by everyone. She puts on a dynamic and exciting show.
3,REPACKAGED WITH 3 MUSIC VIDEOS!,"Having already purchased this DVD just a few weeks ago, I was mightily perturbed when I went into Best Buy today to see a repackaged version containing ""Additional DVD with Cher music videos""! Don't get me wrong; I'm thrilled to have the videos (which are, ""If I Could Turn Back Time,"" ""We All Sleep Alone"", and ""Heart of Stone""), but why not include them in the first issuing in the first place? I basically had to shell out an extra $20.00 just to get the videos. And why not have a more thorogh selection of videos, as well? How about ""I Found Someone"" or ""Believe"" or ""Song For the Lonely"", for crying out loud?As I said, glad to have the videos -- three is better than 0 -- but it does seem like a way to milk more money from longtime fans who already have the first edition. How about a separate offering of JUST her videos? Sheesh..."
3,"CHER, The Farrewell Tour",Pour les amateurs francophone:Cher est égale à elle-mme dans ses chansons et dans ses costumes
5,Wonderful,"Cher is a great artist to watch, see, and to meet. Her personality just suits everyone who loves her music. I personally don't have the chance to go to any of her concerts. But the DVD did me proud. I tape the original on tv. I decided to get a DVD for the future."
1,This fell apart immediately,"My 5 year old son begged for this for months so we bought it for him for Christmas. Much to his dismay, it fell apart before the first badge was even completed. During the first step of the process, all of the plastic innerds snapped and fell apart. I am hoping that we just got a faulty one and may try to find another one in the future. We are really disappointed though."
1,It's Junk!,"This thing broke after it made 3 badges. If you order it, don't order any extra badges because you won't get a chance to use them!!!!"
5,It's a toy...not a professional kit... therefore the price.,"I purchased this item to make firefighter badges for my son's birthday party. I was a little concerned about the purchase after reading some of the reviews, but I couldn't find another kid's button maker online. When I received it I was relieved to find that it did a great job making all the little badges we needed without a hitch. The buttons really are quite cute. Is it indestructible? So far so good. Do the buttons look like they are professionally made? They are good but not perfect. But then again it cost me $27 not $200. For the money, I think it was a pretty darn good bye. We will definitely be buying a refill kit! Lots of fun."
1,Total disappointment,"My daughter received this toy at a holiday party. She was delighted, and couldn't wait to try it out. Although she followed the instructions, the toy jammed immediately and the inside broke before she could complete her first badge. She is in tears as we speak. Now that I read the reviews on this product, I am not surprised. We are glad we did not pay for this toy, and strongly advise others not to buy it. If it were an option to give it no stars at all, we would give it NO STARS!"
4,Loved it.,My package came as described and in great time. I didn't have any trouble receiving but I hate that I can't get more. Thanks
4,I am very happy with my purchase,"I am very happy with my purchase:-- perfect for backing up personal data (MS Office files, pictures, music files, video files etc) from my personal use laptop-- have not had any problems with power requirements for running the hard drive (it comes with a two USB wire - both of which need to be plugged into my laptop -- i have a Dell Inspiron E1405 purchased in 2006)-- speed of backup is pretty good for my needs (earlier today, I backed up 6 GB of data in 3-5 minutes)-- its lightweight and small."
1,Died on second use,"It was very easy to set up and wrote my 40gigs of backup in maybe 30 minutes (my computer is older). Unfortunately I can't comment on its use after that since the second time I hooked it up, it wouldn't work. The light flashes for a few, then dies and the drive isn't recognized. It was also easy to get through to customer support (the troubleshooter on the website directed me to do this). The company wants me to MAIL it back (with my entire hard drive on there) to them and frankly I am furious right now."
3,No documentation...,"Drive is not the 'no brainer' storage drive I thought it would be. My fault, probably. BUT there is absolutely NO real installation manual to help or troubleshoot with. I was lead to believe it would work as easy as a usb thumb drive, so far not the case. Ceedo software may be my problem?? I too have the disconnect error problem. Annoying authorization popup issues with VISTA. All I wanted to do was store years of pictures safely. BTW the help forum at Seagate website was mostly a list of problems... not many solutions. I emailed tech support... so far no reply. Maybe I'm generous in giving 3 stars."
2,Too much of a Hodge Podge,"Ok, it hooks up easily, thats about the best I can say about it, there is no real instruction manual, its just a hodge podge of what to do, totally disconnected, If you want to spend the time on it, I am sure it will work well, I have neither the time nor the patience to mess around with this, trying to contact Seagate is a waste of time, I really could use this drive, somehow, I did get things downloaded, how, I don't know.I really cannot in all honesty say this is a bad product, what is bad is the lack of a logical instruction booklet.Mine is going back, its of no use to me."
2,Disappointed,"I have many GE phones, and I have had the most problems with this one. I had to send in my first one for repairs, and they sent me a second one. I got the second one back, and it still didn't work. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,Misinformed,"It states that the phone is usually sold with the Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband, so I had assumed that the phone had a headset jack. Well it doesn't, so PLEASE don't purchase the two together. I've opted to return this phone for a refund and purchase the AT&T 993 Corded 2-Line Speakerphone instead."
5,A Breakthrough Work!,"Unfortunately, we Americans have been taught a view of Arab and Muslim cultures that are slanted by power politics, religious parochialism, and petrodollars.In this definitive work, Dr. El Guindi presents the historic, religious, and cultural foundations for veiling clearly and succinctly. The best work on this subject, Dr. El Guindi has removed the layers of distortion and misconception in a way that is easily understandable to Westerners.This fascinating and highly readable work is a must for any serious student of Middle-Eastern cultures. It is also a very important tool for anyone who seeks a better understanding of our rapidly shrinking global community.I'd give this work more than five stars, if I could.Kari Sprowl, M.A."
1,Rhetoric Shmetoric: this book is incredibly boring,"After reviewing the need for and renewed acceptance of rhetoric in the sciences, the book turns in to a unbelievably dull rendering of scientific pieces by authors who have yet to master the art of rhetoric."
2,Phone that doesn't save messages,"When we first installed the phone it worked great but after a month or so the ringer stopped working. The digital answering part of the phone worked intermittenly. Than the volume controls went haywire, one day it was very loud, the next it could hardly be heard.I like all the features and the price was low. But in this case maybe I should have bought a more expensive phone maybe it would work. Ya get what you pay for."
4,Garden Planner Review,Contains much valuable information for those planning a perennial garden. The book is arranged with flip pages so the reader can match colors with height of plants. Excellent reference for the gardener's library.
5,I love this book! What a great idea!,"I love this book because you can mix and match different plants and see what they are going to look like next to each other. This is how it works: Simular to the picture on the front there is 3 different plants possibly at one time; top, middle and bottom. Each plant is on an idex card size page. You flip through the index cards and can match 3 plants that you like together. This book has many different plants to choose from so there are endless possibilites. On the back of each index card it has plant facts. For example the back of the index card states when the plant blooms, if the plant perfers sun or shade or how much moisture it tolerates and much more. I highly recommend it for planning you garden. I have loaned it to friends who have bought their own copies because they love it so much too!"
4,Good HD upgrade over OEM,These shocks are pretty fair and do the job on older trucks with limited after market options.I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good stock replacement.
4,A Great Resource For This Concept,"I'll just say it, I hate the US measurement system. I hate teaching it. So I was shocked at how easily the four little characters on this placemat taught the concepts. The pictures are perfect and the explanations are solid. My 8-year olds can now intelligently discuss differences between the US and the metric systems of measurement and explain which one makes more sense and why (we purchased the metric placemat as well). I use them both as posters instead of placemats; they are taped onto our wall.I have only one criticism: there are no comparison reference points or examples. A pound is 16 ounces period. For most kids, that means very little to them. A simple comparison to something common would have been helpful."
1,Garbage,"Don't buy this. It is complete garbage. I had this for almost a year. The whole time I used the car charger it buzzed/squealed in the background. Then it finally broke. If I wasn't such a cheapskate, I would have replaced it sooner. And the home charger I only use maybe 5 times, then it fell apart in my light socket. I had to pull one of the prongs out of my socket with a pair of needle nose pliers (scary). Don't buy this cheap garbage, I know the price is tempting, but in this case you get what you pay for."
1,Dead battery,The watch arrived with no movement at all. Not sure if the watch is ok or not. Then bring to the local watch store to find out that the batteries are all dead !!!! cheap vendor to cheap to install new batteries !!!! POS !!!
1,Worthless,"When we got our first 2 ferrets we wanted to make sure we had everything for them. These, however, are a WASTE of money. I used them on one ferret's nail and stopped immediately they do not cut the nails. They crust the nails. I knew that I didn't want to continue doing that on the other nails. So I went to the medicine cabinet and picked out a pair of my nail clippers and used them. They are much better my ferret don't mind me cutting their nails with these and it goes much faster. This is an awful product I was compelled to write something after reading the above review. They are just not worth it."
2,Just Okay,"These are good in theory, however, I find that they shred the edges of the nail that's left and then they get caught on clothing or blankets. I had my ferret get her nail caught on a blanket, fell off of the top level of her cage and was hanging by the torn nail and screeching! It was really scary and it left her toe bloody :(I think that they need to make these sharper so they make a clean cut."
1,Sucks really bad.,"DO NOT BUY THESE. I got mine, and you have to squeeze incredibly hard to close them all the way, and even then, they don't really work well. You could buy 4 human nail clippers for the price, and those work better. I want to find the engineer they paid to design this crap and strangle him."
5,Aces!,"I read some of the late Thomas Chastain's mysteries years ago & this one is a solid page-turner! True, it does help to know a bit about NYC, but this I highly recommended for fellow mystery buffs! (No, it has nothing to do with the late WTC, as it was penned in the 1970's & the bulk of the action takes place in midtown.)"
3,Good in ways the author did not intend.,"This is a great book for reasons that the author never intended. Brewer was not really an executive nor a whistleblower, but basically a paralegal who played the Enron game and eventually lost. What makes the book so interesting is that Brewer seems to lack the self-realization of her participation in Enron's dysfunctional culture. I recommend the book for college classes in organization behavior and business ethics."
2,How Not To...,"You really want to give this woman money by buying her book? She wasn't an executive and didn't actually choose to be a whistleblower, she plead out. Part of her plea agreement is that she had to found the ""Integrity Institute"" (not sure why the judge thought she'd be qualified for that). She knew there was impropriety for years, but whenever she brought it up Enron gave her enough stock options for her to look the other way. Ah yes, integrity. She spoke at my university and when a student said that he wants to have a successful career but not break the law, her advice was, ""Just be sure you make enough money that you can afford a good lawyer.""This book could be a great ""what NOT to do"" book on integrity, and it can certainly spawn interesting conversations in a HS or college Ethics class, but I recommend you get it from the library so as not to pad Brewer's pockets any more."
1,'A' for Self-Promotion; 'F' for Ethics,"Brewer is the last person who should be lecturing anyone on ethics. As verified by USA Today in an article on October 12, 2007, she was neither an executive at Enron nor was she in any position to have witnessed the wholesale malfeasance she described. That anyone would believe a word that comes out of her mouth or springs from her pen is a tragedy. That she should continue to profit from her dishonesty is a travesty."
1,Very Disapointing!,"I am a HUGE kid rock fan, but this dvd/video is crap. all it is is a bunch people talking about kid rock and a swear they had to say kid rock is a dj about 1,000,000 times. it doesn't even have kid rock in it at all. only if u are a diehard kid rock fan and want to have everything of his buy this, but otherwise DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Wait for Something Authorized,"I am obsessed with Kid Rock, but that didn't make me like this DVD. There are only still pictures of him in this, no actual live footage, and there are only a few pictures at that.I hope Kid Rock will release an authorized DVD soon, and spare anyone else from buying this junk."
3,You might find this acceptable,"Not really the best of kid rocks merchandise but then again if you really are into kid rock you may like thid dvd. You would enjoy this dvd even more,if you have already obtained one on his earlier albums 'grit's sandwiches for breakfast'."
4,Great 80s blues-soul album,"A veteran singer who was 48 years old and had many albums to her credit when she made this, Denise LaSalle's big, authoritative voice is an amazing thing to hear whether she's singing blues, soul, gospel, or even disco (as she did briefly). The bluesy sentiment of the songs on this album along with the up-to-date but decidedly blues-based arrangements make it a very entertaining listen, and fans of straight-up 80s R&B shouldn't be disappointed by the song ""Footprints Of A Fool""."
3,"Nice except for ""bonus""","We liked this dvd. Gentle Christmas themed stories. However, we did not expect or desire the Clown of God story. It's fine if your kids are used to moralistic bible stories. It's not so fine if you have a sensitive child who is not. Essentially, a man earns his living being a clown, making no time to pursuit religion. He becomes too old to perform and goes to stay with the monks. He is inspired to perform one last time and through God's grace he does the best performance of his life. Then he dies.The other extra story is Too Many Tamales. It's about a girl who is helping her mother make tamales. She can't resist the temptation to try on her mother's ring. The ring disappears from her hand while she is mixing the dough. She and her siblings force themselves to eat all the tamales in search of the ring but cannot find it. The girl confesses in tears to her mother. Then notices her mother is wearing the ring. Everyone pitches in to make new tamales."
2,Poor showing,"I previously owned a High Gear Altimax, and switching to this was a nightmare...difficult to operate, confusing buttons. The mode button hits my wrist all the time time changing modes, the rubber guard keeping the strap tight come loose very often, and visually, the digital display is confusing when unless looking directly on it, as the numbers blend making it difficult to see what time it is. Poor selection. High Gear was not much more $ and easier to use."
3,Suunto Altimax,I liked the watch. Some may think it's a little big but I didn't think it was too bad. My complaint is the wrist band. It isn't made very well and the band pops out of the holder. It got really annoying so I had to send it back. Went with a casio and am very happy.
2,Nothing like Suunto Vector HR,"I have the ""Suunto Vector HR white"" and I love the watch. Very light and very easy to read the display.This is why I decided to buy this model Altimax. Looking the photos, both models looked very similar but when I received the Altimax I got realized that they arevery different.The watchband is more rigid and the the LCD is not good - the eyes must be positioned 90 degrees over the screen, otherwise you will not be able to read it.If you try to read at 45 degrees, the LCD became black. Very bad."
4,Go Hiking,"Good product according the price, wolud be perfect if the temperature is exact no matter you are wearing the watch, good delivery and good user guide."
4,So relaxing!,"This album is so relaxing. Good way to tune out the busyness of life and wind down at the end of a long day. Most enjoyable, and glad I found it."
2,Noisy orchestras smothering the cello,"I am utterly mystified at the apparent popularity of this item. In many of the pieces the sound of the cello is utterly overwhelmed by its accompaniment. If you want pure cello, look elsewhere. If you want generic orchestral music which happens to include a cello or two in there somewhere, or if you need muzak that will blend into the background like the noise of a refrigerator you no longer notice, then buy this CD."
1,"bad beads, bad beads...","The price was right, the delivery time was minimal, but the quality is horrible. Of 44 beads, 23 of them couldn't be used due to being improperly drilled or misshaped. I e-mailed the supplier and received no response. As I am disabled, trying to mail the beads back would cost more than the purchase price, so I'm just out the money."
2,"Work fairly well, putting both in creates LOTS of vibration","Car: 2003 Honda Civic LX w/ Manual transmissionWhen I first installed, I only put the front insert in and noticed a good reduction in movement of the engine with a mild increase in vibration. With the installation of the rear one, there was a small increase in stiffness, but a HUGE increase in vibrations.Biggest problem is the amount of modification that the rear mount requires to fit. I had to cut a significant amount of it away, then force it in by standing on it. It might fit the automatic (which I think has a slightly different mount) better.Just be aware that these are not going to be as good as aftermarket mounts, but are a decent budget alternative."
5,Eagerly waiting,"As soon as Amazon gets this video in, I'm ordering. I grew up watching wonder woman, and am deeply offended that today's little girls do not have that opportunity. This should be required syndication on a national level!Yes, Lynda Carter was a beauty queen, but she was not airheaded or anorexic. Heck, she was an amazon who could and did save the day while getting the hot guy. Thankfully Wonder Woman's version of ""girl power"" would be way more Xena/Buffy than Spice Girls. Wonder Woman can hold her own in any sittuation.Excluding the horrid Cathy Lee Crosby movie, the series was very well done for the time and still holds up. Wonder Woman is one of the greatest shows of all times, and needs to be offered as soon as possible."
3,Pretty with mediocre zippers,"I received a very pretty red brocade jewelry roll. I like having the large open pocket as well as the zip pockets, so this roll can handle several sizes of necklaces. The snap holding the ring bar is good, but the zippers are a bit sticky and have to be handled gently."
2,A Crisis in Explanation,"I suspect that buried somewhere in these 264 pages of largely unreadable prose is a rather interesting 20 page essay. I'll confess that I gave up trying to find it about halfway through the book. The insights offered simply weren't worth filtering through the difficult writing style. For a wider-ranging and more readable book, I recommend THE NUDE MALE: A NEW PERSPECTIVE by Margaret Walters."
2,The perfect Phone,"Well, I got this phone for $50. It was a good buy. Well, I did not plan to use the caller Id but I found that the display would not come on hardly at all without it. I am not sure the Caller Id works since I do not plan to use it. Well the display worked one time only. So I have no way to turn off the ringer. The sound quality is good. The distance is less than my 900mz At&t mainly because it has a out of range warning that makes you stop. There is no buss in the phone but sometimes music on the other side comes and goes. It seems ok on phone calls. Over all it is a good phone but It waste a lot of power and I am not sure if it is just not working right. The sound is ok though. It is hard to find a good phone though."
5,ONLY THE BEST!!!!,"This proves that rock can expand to romantic ballad of love. None better than Pete to do this of course. The lyrical value of this song is unique and bold. Simply cause one can point the finger at Pete over The Libertines does not allow us to dismay such talent. Personally, this is my favorite song from Pete to this date."
2,No Big Deal,"I use a portable toilet weekly. The CONS: The bowl holds liquid & needs to be wiped clean after each use. OR liquid stands on the lip of the bowel. It is a little awkward to carry & dump. The flush is had to pull The spout has to be cleaned and DRYED put back underneath, The spout touches the floor.PROs: The seat is comfortable. It holds plenty. Looks nice.ALL in ALL I would not buy this Portable Toilet, again."
2,SLIDE PORBLEM,"WE HAVE TWO OF THIS PRODUCT IN OUR CAMP FOR WINTER USE . AFTER ONE YEAR THE FLUSH SLIDE BECOMES VERY HARD TO USE . IT STICKS . I CALLED THE FACTORY , YOU GET VOICE MAIL THAT SAYS THEY WILL RETURN THE CALL AT THERE CONVIENCE . 60 DAYS LATER AND STILL NO RETURN CALL ."
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this to be used for a camping trip with my 4 and 10 year old so I would not have to leave one in teh tent while I went with the other to the comfort station. I haveto say thsi unit is much larger than I thought it would be. It held all of us with a problem. It worked fine but then it began to leak around the hand pump. I don't think it is worth the price of it. If I coudl do it all over again, I would not have purchased it."
5,Very Happy,"We have a small cabin and do not have a bathroom yet, I read many reviews and this had the best. We have had it a couple of weeks and so far are very happy with it. There are no leaks, it flushes well, and we have not had any odor. I purchased the Walex Bio-11530 Bio-Pak and it has a pleasant odor and seems to be doing the job. For our purposes this has been a good purchase."
5,Great potty!,"Seriously, this is a nice portable toilet. Easy to clean and functions well. Use and care for it as recommended, and it stays fresh. Worth every penny."
2,A BIT TOO LOW,"I PURCHASE THIS, FOR MY GOD-MOTHER WHO WAS RECOVERING FROM MAJOR SURGERY, HER BEDROOM WAS MOVE TO THE FIRST FLOOR, SO THEREFORE SHE NEEDED A PORTABLE TOILET.. HOWEVER THIS ONE WAS JUST TO SHORT, ACTUALLY IT WAS TO LOW TO THE GROUND, NOT GOOD FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS HEALTH ISSUES AND CAN'T BEND."
5,Visa 268 Portable Toilet,"This is a wonderful product. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Just the right height for those with back problems.Are 5 years of camping twice a month, our other one finally gave way. (the trap handle broke, everything else still works). We have looked at other models and they do not measure up to the Visa 268.We highly recommend the Visa 268."
2,"TOO MANY LEAKS, WIDTH IN AD NOT ACTUAL","FIGURED ID PAY THE EXTRA MONEY BECAUSE LIKE WE ALL KNOW ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"" UNFORTUNATELY THIS ITEM DOESNT HOLD ITS WEIGHT...BUT NOT THE WORST EITHER...FIRST THE PROS; THE BOWL IS DEEPER AND THE FLUSH HOLE IS PLACED IN A GOOD LOCATION ON THE BOWL, TWO DIRECTIONAL RINSE, PRETTY AND NICE SMOOTH SURFACE, THE RIGHT HEIGHT.... NOW THE CONS: AIR VENT LEAKS CLEAN WATER WHEN CLEAN WATER TANK IS FULL AND IN ROUGH SEAS,FLUSH PUMP LEAKS CLEAN WATER WHEN PUMPING AND FILLING THE BOWL TO FLUSH, THE LOW/FULL INDICATORS ARE USELESS...BUT THE BIGGEST LET DOWN WAS THAT THE AMAZON AD STATES THE POTTI'S WIDTH IS (16.125"")SIXTEEN INCHES PLUS WIDE....ABSOLUTLEY FALSE!!! THE POTTI IS ONLY 13 INCHES WIDE. ME BEING SIX THREE AND 225 LBS WAS SOLD ON THE WIDTH IN THE AD IF ANYTHING BUT WAS VERY DISAPOINTED TO SEE THE WIDTH WAS ONLY (13"") THIRTEEN INCHES WIDE. OVERALL A DECENT PRODUCT BUT CAN GET THE SAME THING WITH A WIDER SEAT FOR A WHOLE LOT LESS."
5,Great Product,"We bought this portable toilet based on reviews and we are glad we did. We bought a 1968 camper and instead of retrofitting a toilet at a great expense we went with the Visa Potty.. It works well and is easy to dump and maintain. We recommend opening the flush mechanism either slowly or leaving it slightly open when changing elevations, since the toilet seals extremely well pressure changes can cause minor issues,"
3,Nice product but it smells like excrement,I was unable to try it yet. The stench was terrible. I assume someone returned it after using it for an outing. I repackaged it and put it in the storage. When the apocalyptic end comes i will have no choice but to use it.
1,Terribly Disappointed and I felt ripped off!~!~!,"Although I enjoyed the full CD of James Blunt's ""Back To Bedlam"", when I saw another new CD for $3.50+ + $5.00 for shipping I figured a deal was at hand!...until I opened it and there were two versions of ""You're Beautiful"" (one copied from radio and one James sung with an Acoustic guitar, there was one added song, but by then I wanted to send this $9.00 debacle back to where-ever it came from. I saw no warning that the CD contained only two songs alike and one different one.It reminded me of the old Extended plays 45's that we got 3-4 songs on..and they were rippoffs that did NOT last long either!Rick ""Strings"" Lauzon~~~~"
2,Goodbye,"Don't expect a full CD of songs by this new artist, a two-hit wonder. Goodbye, My Lover Part one is all you get, albeit a long version."
3,Goodbye Mr. Blunt,"James Blunt is one of the very few perfomers this past year who has definitely delivered with so many great songs from You're Beautiful, to the soulful High. His thrid single, Goodbye My Lover, from is debut album Back To Bedlam, really doesn't hit the mark as his earlier singles did. Although the song isn'ta bad song, I just actually didn't find this one as appealing as the other songs. The melody seems here a bit more somber, than soulful and uplifting. I still love his songs, but I just hope the next single he comes out with delivers a bit better than right now. This isn't as beautiful as before.Song: C 1/2+"
2,Fine While It Lasted,"I got this watch about 15 months ago, and it recently stopped working. I guess it lasted about as long as the battery did, which is not terribly impressive. The battery died, and I had it replaced, but the timekeeping function didn't start working again (the Indiglo still did though). I'm disappointed that the watch barely lasted past its warranty period, and since this has happened with the last 3 Timexes I've bought, I won't be purchasing another one. It's just not worth paying $30 every year for a new watch when I can buy another, more expensive brand and have it last 10 or more years."
4,Good Value Watch,"I bought this watch because I needed one before I left for vacation. I have worn it every single day for 6 weeks now and I plan to continue doing so.It seems to be pretty sturdy, the face doesn't scratch easily, keeps time well, easy to set and the indiglo is a great feature.The watch is very big, almost everyone will need to get a few links removed.I am a ""big boned"" kind of girl, so I feel safe in suggesting that you plan on getting the links removed when you purchase the watch. I took it to a jewelry store while I was on vacation and they took out the links for free. Now that it has been adjusted it fits well, and it goes with absolutely everything.I took away one star because some of the links tend to look scratched at the end of the week and it needs cleaning every week. Other than that, I love this watch."
3,Good watch but face is big.,"I bought this as a present for my sister. She wanted one with clear numbers (instead of dots) and with a date function. So it has all that she requires. The only thing is the face of the watch was much bigger than I had expected so it doesn't look as slim and feminine. It doesn't look so on the pictures but when it came, I was surprised. I would have liked it to be a bit smaller."
1,What a waste of time and money,"The watch looked great but the band was way too big. The instructions for removing the pins that hold the links in place are awful. After finally figuring it out I realized it wouldn't be worth paying a jeweler so I gave it a go. One hour later, following a badly scratched band with the pins only partially removed since they got stuck (no they were not bent) I achieved a high level of satisfaction by using a hammer to smash the thing to pieces. Timex... you surely make one helluva a crappy watch these days. I bought a Fossil and am LOVING it!"
1,I NEED YOUR HELP,"I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THE WATCH BECAUSE I NOW HAVE THE ONE THAT I WANTED,I MISSED PLACE THE ORDER SHEET FOR THIS ITEM IF YOU WOULD PLEASE SEND ME ANOTHER ORDER FORM FOR THIS WATCH THEN I CAN RETURN IT.THANK YOUMS MARILYN TUCKER"
4,Not a dainty or dress watch...,"I bought this watch for myself, as I needed a watch for Nursing. I am very happy with the quality of this timepiece, but when reading the reviews, I thought it wasn't as large as it really is. I needed to have 5 links taken out (go to Walmart - free service), and I didn't really think I had tiny wrists, but I guess I do. I am 5'6"" and this watch looks large on me. The watch looks manly. The band is not small...the whole watch is absolutely smaller than a man's watch, but there is nothing feminine about it all. It will serve it's purpose of being able to do checks in the middle of the night (indiglo), but not for dinner out with the hubby."
4,Classic? Yes,I really like this watch - I am always on the lookout for a nice watch with an easy to read face (but not overly large) - this watch is perfect. Like a lot of the other reviewers I was not able to adjust the band and ended up taking it to a timex store - they were able to knock out a few links in less than 5 minutes. Since I seem to have a weakness for watches I am sure I will keep my eyes open for another but this one should keep me happy for quite a while
5,Silver Times,I love this watch. I love the date window because I can actually read the date without trying to figure out what it says. It is very hard to find a watch that fits all of my needs at one time. I am very picky when it comes to a good watch & this is one watch that will last for many happy years.
4,"Great Watch, exept.....","Well, I bought this watch at walmart instead of on amazon, and could have saved $13 if I would have bought it here. That's okay, I got the band adjusted immediately while I waited. The only problem I am having, is that about every other day, I have to readjust the date. Either the watch won't have changed to the next date, or it will change before it's supposed to. Other than that I love the watch, it keeps good time, and looks great either for dress-up or for casual."
2,Disappointing Experience,"I received this watch for Christmas and was pleased with the overall style: practical, pretty but not flashy. It was perfect for everyday wear. In July, I went to check the time in the dark only to discover that the pin that changes the time and light was gone. Now I've never had that happen to a watch, so I was a bit disappointed. Of course I figured, its a fluke, the watch has a year warranty and this would qualify. I mean its not like that would be considered wear and tear or damage from abuse. So I paid about $10 (signature required)to send it to Timex for repair. About 3-4 weeks later it was returned to me repaired. Along with it came an $8 bill for shipping. Now the watch cost approximately $32. I spent $10 to send it to them and now they want $8 for returning it to me. So lets do the math folks...that's $18....for $14 more I could have bought a new one. Not that I would buy one again."
2,good watch but not the indiglo,"Like another reviewer, I had this watch less than 2months when the Indiglo feature stopped working, which was the reason I bought this particular watch in the first place. Guess I should send it to Timex to have them fix it while it's still under warranty. It's disappointing, I've had other Indiglo watches that lasted for years."
3,"OK, but like others better","This women's Indiglo watch face is a little too big, even though I am 5'8"". Also, you must take it to a jeweler to adjust the wrist band and unfortunately, taking out links either makes it too tight (or too loose if one is added back in). I probably wouldn't buy it again because of its face size and wrist-sizing issue."
2,felt cheap and way to big,Timex Women's T29271 Elevated Classics Dress Sport Chic Silver-Tone Bracelet Watch - felt cheap and was way to big for a woman's hands. Resizing would have made it look silly for the number of links that needed to come out with the big clap underneath.
2,Not What I Expected,I have had other Timex lighted watches that I liked very much. This one looks good but is way too big and I have a fairly large wrist. It also loses time. Very disappointing.
1,won't fit,they did not explain in the product description that it is NOT elastic or retractable band. Only fits a giant. Way too big.
5,This is a great watch!,"This watch was everything I wanted in a timepiece, but couldn't find in any of the local stores. Silvertone, which matches my jewelry since I prefer silver to gold, I needed a calendar for work, plus indiglo for seeing in the dark. The only difficulty I found at all was in adjusting the band, which was a bit difficult even with the instructions, but a family member was able to accomplish it. I now wear this watch every day, and I love it."
3,"Great Watch, Bad Indigo","I recently purchased this watch and have had some problems with it. The good thing is that it looks great. It's a good watch for professionals who don't want multiple watches and want to be able to wear to any kind of function. It does a good job of that. Plus it doesn't look too bulky, which to me was crucial because I have very small wrists. However, my indiglo gave out on me last week after only having my watch for 6 weeks. Luckily, Timex sent me a pre-paid box to send it back to the factory. The warranty lasts for a year too. The only problem I face now will be getting Timex to either take out the extra links or reimburse me for having to get someone else to do it for me. Hopefully mine was just a fluke."
3,"A pretty watch, but beware!","I like this watch. I really do. It's attractive, yet the dial is very easy to read. The problem is that (this has happened to me TWICE!!) the knob pulls out (to the time-setting position) easily. I was quite late returning to work one day because I didn't notice my watch had stopped."
3,Looks great but it's not wearable,"This watch looks great. However, it comes without a necessary tool for the adjustment of gigantic wristband. Even the repair kit for glasses does not have tiny enough screwdriver for the purpose. At first, this left me puzzled regarding my options; finally, I am quite unhappy that I had to spend additional time and money to find a jewelry store that would fix it for me."
3,Nice watch but problems with the band,"While this is a nice watch, the design of the band makes it very difficult to adjust it to a smaller size. This appears to be a design problem with the new Timex bands of this type."
2,Do not purchase this watch!!,"The watch itself is a nice piece of jewelry for the price. However, the band is a mess. It comes as an extra large band. You need a special tool to remove the links. If you're looking to buy the watch and wear it right away. Be prepared to make a visit to a jeweler and pay money for a band. I was so disappointed when I or my husband couldn't remove the links. This is a warning."
3,A nice watch,"This is a nice watch. Here are the things I wish I had known. The face is light pink and the numbers are not sharply contrasted or large.. average face to read. I wanted blacker numbers and an easier to read face. Not the fault of the watch or the product description.. just my oversight. The band is quite large.. about 7 1/2 inches and I LOVE that about it. It really is a floppy bracelet watch which I wanted.. however, it is quite heavy. I would like it better if it were thinner and lighter. All in all, it's a nice watch! But I'm still shopping.. :)"
5,Love this watch,I am a nurse and this watch is perfect for wearing to work. It has an easy to read face with the date and a second hand which are essential in my work. It is also very easy to clean.
3,Next to impossible to re-size the band yourself,"The band supplied with the watch is huge, and the directions for removing links are arcane. I've watched tutorials from You Tube, read the directions thoroughly, and found explanations online but was still unable to remove the pins to make the band smaller. I'm not sure the watch is worth the bother of taking it to a jewelry store for the band to be re-sized."
1,2 weeks old & broken!,"I'm not particularly hard on my watches and I really liked wearing this one to work...until it broke after only a couple weeks of use. Fell off my arm because a pin mysteriously disappeared. I had had it adjusted (removed 6 links - it's a very large watch!) but the pin that fell out was close to the face, not the clasp, so I doubt the adjustment had much to do with it.Perhaps it's just a fluke, but I definitely wouldn't spend my money on it again!"
5,Great Watch,"I got my watch 2 days after I ordered it! These ppl are amazing. Also the watch will be used for nursing classes, I just need to have a few links removed. The watch comes with instructions on how to remove them I gave it a try. But stopped because I was afraid id break it! Great Buy! Lighting, the look, has calendar day & keeps military time!"
2,Ouch!,"Little could we have told by the pictures, but the watch band does not have single-piece links. They have edges to them which come in contact with the wrist when in use. They scratched my wife's arm up pretty bad. After three weeks, my wife couldn't take it any longer and had to ""heal.""Maybe it was only our experience.Other than that, the watch is priced right, glows beautifully when needed by pressing the crown, the shows beautifully for elegant functions or everyday use. Too bad for the ""ouch"" factor though..."
5,New Watch,"I had a watch for many years -- my favorite watch, wore it all the time, everywhere. When it finally gave up the ghost, I mourned... What will I do now?! I am very picky when it comes to watches. I do not care for the new digital watches or fancy-schmancy watches that are frivilous and foofy, and being an EMS tech, I needed a watch that had a second hand so I can track stats while doing blood pressure test, etc. I also wanted a watch that could stand up to my standard busy day. I chose Timex for the quality the name promises. It is a very nice watch. I feel comfortable wearing this watch in my line of work, as well as, out on the town with the girls! Elegant, yet durable. Just right!"
3,2-for-1 budget pack of Latin motets for 2-4 soloists.,"The music here is a complete collection from 1614 - of the same genre as smaller pieces by Viadana or Durante, primarily on excerpts from psalms, and other well known motet texts. The longest pieces are a 9'22"" Stabat Mater for alto, two tenors, and bass and an 8'41"" litany of the Virgin. Recorded in 1998 this set includes a couple of prominent members of Concerto Italiano among the soloists and is, as you'd expect, well performed. Timing [41'35"" 64'25""].It loses only one star because Coma, while good, is not Monteverdi, and another star for not having texts. One never used to expect texts for budget CDs but these days when most, though not all, Naxos vocal releases have texts the bar has been raised an inch."
3,Overly sentimental look at fascinating Americana history,"Burma-Shave is an overly sentimental look at the history of Burma-Shave. The book contains a lot of fascinating information about Americana history, especially that pertaining to the rise of the automobile and successful business marketing through the depression. However, the writing is clumsy and the number of times the author mentions the ""good old days"" and how much better things were in simpler times gets old really fast. His right-wing leanings are thinly veiled, too.This is a very quick read, but by the end there is the sense that the author is looking for things to write about. Still, the story is fascinating, as are the photos and the way the Burma Shave slogans, which are all reprinted here, reflect America at the time."
5,wtm mtb parts/,"top cog manufacturer-$$$ well spent,grips are very comfortable+they can take abuse.WTB have been w/mtb a long time & their products are well tested.....thanks for the deals."
5,Where has this one been all my life?,"At 36 years old and having been a music fan/collector since 10, I am still ocassionally amazed at some of the music that has eluded me all these years. This is one of those times. As I write this I am listening to ""Blood well Right"". I have had the ""Breakfast in America albums for years and it has been one of my favs. This album seems to be a little more of the prog rock style with a more varied range of sounds, though I love ""Breakfast in America"" as well. This is great albums all the way through."
4,MFSL 24K gold review.,"Not as good as other MFSL releases, the kick drum and snare lack bottom end, cymbals are a little aggressive,, piano thought doesn't overload like the 2002 remaster (check Bloody Well Right), there's more dynamic range. Not bad but could have been better!"
4,Very Deep,"Undoubtedly this recording was created with alot of care as you can feel the emotions of the performers in every single track. The style here is much different from Breakfast In America as every song(with the possible exception of Dreamer)sounds like a symphony. To ellaborate further, each song has deeply developed chord structures and varying rhythms and moods. I am first getting used to this record, so I can not quite give it a perfect five yet. I guess it takes time to absorb all the instrumental touches and there are times when all these touches can be overwhelming to some listeners. But it definitely is worthy of four stars. Maybe even four and a half."
5,Instrumentation at its best! Grossly under-rated album.,"The most striking thing about this album is that the musical score is beautifully composed. As well the instrumentation is fresh often using many acoustic instruments. (A refreshing alternative to the overly digitized music of today) The music and lyrics have depth and most importantly the music remains ""musical"". Unlike other groups such as Pink Floyd (to name an example) which try to be ""deep"" just for the sake of being deep. Supertramp's Crime of the Century retains a creative yet likeable ""musicality"" which so many groups today seem to be lacking. The album in terms of it's ""design"" is reminiscent of the Beatles' ""Sargeant Pepper""."
5,Crime of the Century,"One of our favorite cd's.Some of the best music of the 70's or better yet ""EVER!"" Every song is classic and will never get old. Super Tramp lives on!"
3,quality release,"Most folks only know Supertramp from the multi-platinum release ""breakfast in america"" and this is usually all the credit they receive from critics as well. Much of this has to do with their enormous promise they could never live up to. ""Crime of the Century"", however, is one of their finest efforts. The 1974 albums contains the classic-rock radio friendly hits ""School"", ""Bloody well Right"", and ""Dreamer"". The rest of the album, while containing much weaker efforts still has moments such as the title track and ""Hide in your shell"". The band mixes blues influence well with touches of jazz in a production seemingly newer than 1974. (thats 30 years past!) A good album to start with if interested in the work of songwriters Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies. Although I'm sure the kids won't even know who these guys are."
5,Awsome CD but what about a 5.1 mix,"This has been one of my favorite Supertramp Cd's. I wish someone would make a 5.1 mix of this cd, that would be awsome. The Cd Crime of the Century was made for surround sound. I can't beleive that it has not been released as that yet. I'll be waiting."
3,OK,Not very well written but interesting if you're into skydiving or like reading about these kind of things. Not recommended otherwise.
5,Absolutely Excellent,This was the second anime I ever watched and I now have it in my collection. It is a perfect product and it shipped quickly. I am very excited to re-watch this series and enjoy it all over again. Thank you!
5,"Talley Trio Roger, Debra, and Lauren","Track Listings:1. Jesus, I Love You2. Heaven Is Real3. Covered4. Living Water5. Home Where I Belong6. Lord Somebody Needs You7. We Shall See God8. Where The River Runs Red9. He Won't Take Back One Promise10. Center Of My Joy"
4,Better than most philosophy/ethics textbooks,"I liked the dialogue idea...it made what I find to be an otherwise boring subject more interesting. I can't think of any other college textbook I have sat down and read straight through of my own free will lately. All in all, a good, solid introduction to the important questions and philosophies of life. If you want to go more in-depth, buy one of the many thick, squinty-small print tomes available on the subject."
4,Nice wireless sensor,"I had installed my new Visonic alarms system a couple weeks ago, and had 3 wireless magnetic contacts for all the doors. It was very easy to mount and install; however, size are a little big and are harder to disguise. I tested to see the reaction time to the control panel, and was happy on how quick and accurate the sensors were."
3,A little too cartoonish,"This is a nice little anime story but the artwork fell into overly cartoonish style when emotions were high. It is a good little story and I enjoy it; however, among my favorites, it falls down the list quite a way. All in all it was fun to watch, but don't expect too much from it."
2,"Robert DeNiro in ""The Last Tycoon"" falls short","I love Robert DeNiro but would not recommend this as its not one of his best movies. I don't like the screenplay as its not in the 1st person and the plot seems to drag along, hard to watch, and often very boring."
2,The Terrible Tycoon,"Very slow movie, hardly any excitement. Seems like no music either which makes it drag on. Best part is towards the end when DeNiro meets Nicholson."
2,BORING AND PRETENTIOUS FILM.,"When you notice that this movie was directed by Elia Kazan, has the great Robert De Niro in the central role, has a supporting cast with very familiar names (Jack Nicholson, Tony Curtis, Robert Mitchum, Jeanne Moreau and Theresa Russell), you would think that this should be a great movie...well, it isn't, in fact is a very boring movie.""The Last Tycoon"" is full of uninteresting situations, one dimensional characters, a very slow and boring rhythm, in few words this movie is a big disappointment. The only reason to see this sleeping potion, is to see the scene that shows at the same time the screen legends Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson. Beside that, there isn't another highlight.Recommendable only for Robert De Niro fans or Jack Nicholson fans, but most likely they will see this movie only once."
3,Depends Who You Are,"I can understand how a lot of people feel bored by this movie. It mainly just introduces some characters and shows them progressing through their lives with no real direction for the plot, and the ending makes you feel like you have to wait for a sequel to find out what happens in the story. However there are a few reasons to like this movie. Seeing a young Deniro who was aggresive and not playing the same old cop role of today is something to see. Seeing him with fellow icons Robert Mitchim and Jack Nicholson is a once and a lifetime thing to see. Also the attractive woman he persues, could really aggrivate some men who have been in the same situation. Seeing how the prettiest women who can get any man, treat guys so badly and play with their hearts. Also I admire Deniro's character's creativity and drive to be the best at what he does, that's something that can inspire people to be the same way."
2,An All Star Cast Dud,"This film was produced by the legendary Sam Spigel, written by the British playwright Harold Pinterand directed by the legendary Elia Kazan with an all-star cast headed by Robert De Niro, hot afterwinning Best Supporting Actor for Godfather II.The resulting film was a lifeless failure. There was no story and everything seemed fake.The first one to blame was the producer who picked an English playwright to adapt F. Scott Fitzgerald'snovel. Even the normally dynamic and charismatic De Niro wondered through the film looking foran anchor. Ditto for Jack Nicholson.The only stars who managed to shine were Tony Curtis who played a fading star in the moldof Ramon Navarro and the young British actress named Boulding.For films based on the novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald, check out ""The Great Gatsby"" with Robert Redford."
2,This book sucked.,I learned more in my course from my professor than from this book. It was too long and had really drawn out examples.
4,Foundations of Behavioral Research,"This text is a classic for students of the behavioral sciences. It is fairly exhaustive, but it has not been updated since 1999. Therefore, it could use some updating regarding technological advances and examples. The publishers would also benefit from adding online resources for the text."
3,Foundations of Behavioral Research,"Foundations of Behavioral Research by Kerlinger and Lee is one of my prescribed books, for a Research course that I am taking, as part of a Masters program.In the course of working through the book, we (my fellow students and I), have encountered a large number of spelling, grammatical and even content errors. The book needs careful reading and editing.However, the book has a lot to offer if you can look beyond the flaws mentioned above."
3,Dated & Overwritten,"The book is dated and reflects the style and more stilted vocabulary of 40 years ago. Altho tighter editing could have produced a book 200 pages shorter that would have conveyed the same information, the descriptions of theory and nomenclature are adequate; however, the authors are less than clear in attempting to get across any math concepts (Stats by DeVeaux, Velleman & Bock would be a much better choice if your goal is using the math behind the quantitative methods)."
5,"Foundations of Behavioral Research (Kerlinger, Foundations of Behavioral Research)",I received the Book in excellent condition and the shipping was really fast.I really recommend these guys to purchase books from. Wonderful!
3,A supposed classic,This was a textbook for one of my research method classes. Heard it was the Bible in the field. I never liked it.
3,Doesn't adjust easily,"I purchased this for my daughter's saxophone. She didn't like it. It doesn't adjust as easily as her old one. She decided to keep it since her older one has a connection that scratches her sax. Well, I guess you just can't get a perfect strap."
2,Not as advertised,"I bought one of these but ultimately returned it. While itdoes make an OK telephone, the feature that I primarily wanted,a back-lit display, isn't there! The LCD screen is just asimpossible to read in low light as any other LCD that otherreviewers have noted. Buy this for the speakerphone, but bewarned, it does NOT have a back-lit display."
1,IS AMAZON CRAZY??!!??,"THE ENTIRE PREVIEW IS A COMMERCIAL, NOT ONE SECOND OF THE SHOW!! ARE YOU CRAZY, AMAZON??"
2,early television at its not-so-good,"Frankly, this set of science-fiction episodes from the early television era was rather disappointing. I expected the fuzzy technical quality and uninspiring sets, but the episodes lacked some of the tension, suspense, drama, and message I hoped to find. The presence of Lee J. Cobb was one of the things that made me buy this collection, but he wasn't at his best. In fact, many of the performances seem to have needed more rehearsal. The story lines were not very strong in many cases. The collection is interesting in terms of the evolution of television, and two or three of the stories had some good suspense, tension and meaning. Still, I couldn't honestly recommend this particular collection."
2,Tales of Tomorrows,"The dvd was in good condition and very clear to be so old. Speaking of old,it is funny, that back in the day this type of movie was considered scary."
4,I don't give stars easy... This is a great collection!!!,"I bought it for EZ-Rollers' Reconstruction of Pimp Daddy Nash's ""Our Man in Stockholm"" and Fellowship's ""Celebrate Life"". Then I heard the rest of it - It's non-stop. I nearly cried listening to 4 Hero's Mix of NuYorican Soul's ""I am the Black Gold of the Sun"". As far as I'm concerned, from now on, 4 Hero owns that track. Then I heard Exocel's ""Demon Speed""... Forget about it!!!I really dug LTJ Bukem presents Logical Progression... But I'm going out on a limb here - ""This is the most intelligent Drum & Bass compilation ever put together."" If there's one better... Put up or Shut Up."
1,Baby scared for life,"My child (11 months) was watching this video with disinterest when this green reptile puppet popped up and went ""BLAH"" and she started crying... a few months later we tried the same thing and she still started crying when the green puppet came up!"
1,Boring book,This book was very boring. It is all about a stuck-up rich college boys' pet peeves. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5,THIS BOOK BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES EVERYTIME I READ IT.,"I FIRST RECIEVED THIS BOOK BACK IN 1970 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG TEEN , I LOVED IT THEN AND ONCE AGAIN I FOUND THIS BOOK AND READ IT , I STILL LOVE IT.THE PAIN ELEANOR GOES THROUGH IS ALMOST UNBEARABLE BUT GOD HELPS HER THROUGH IT BUT SHE HAD TO LEARN TO LEAN ON HIM AND THEN ONLY FINDS TRUE PEACE WITH HER LIFE. THIS BOOK WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIAL TO ME. NOW IF I COULD ONLY FIND THE SEQUEL TO THIS BOOK THE LIGHT IN MY WINDOW I WILL TRULY BE RELIVING MY YOUNGTEEN LIFE AGAIN. THIS IS A MUST FOR ALL TO READ."
1,Buyer Beware! Contains GMO !!,"I've been buying this product for years and just recently found out that it contains GMO! If you're not familiar with this, google it and you'll see why this is a serious health risk.I contacted Solaray to find out if the product contained Gluten or GMO and kept getting the same response is always ""we cannot certify that it is free of gluten and gmo"", so I asked ""what does this mean?"" They said: ""It's NOT NECESSARILY gluten or gmo free"" (they've made this stupid claim on their CoQ10 product too when I was thinking about buying it and asked them the same question)Well, after numerous phone calls and speaking with supervisor of product info and REPEATEDLY asking him the same question (he was also evasive, by not answering with a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer), he FINALLY said:""Vitamin E comes from soy and the soy contains GMO""Buyer Beware!!"
4,A writer to watch: humorous and challenging,"Someone gave me two mysteries, one by Sharon McCrumb (ugh) and this one by Don Harstad (superb). His work needs a little smoothing (this is only his second book), but ""Known Dead"" is one of the best stories I've read this year. His self-deprecating hero matches his humorous approach to murder. Some parts are so clever (I won't give them away) you may want to cheer."
4,Excellent read,"I have read several of Harstad's books now and have enjoyed all of them. This one I listened to as an audio book and Ron McLarty does a great job reading. If you are a fan of Harstad, I heartily recommend Steven Havill's Posadas county series also."
3,Known Dead,"I really liked ""Eleven Days"" but this was a little disappointing for me. It was just a little too technical and it didn't ""grab"" me right from the start. That doesn't mean I won't get Harstad""s next book but I just didn't like ""Known Dead"" as much."
1,Not what I expected,Not what I expected from Chris LeDoux. Would not want this again even if it were free. There was only 5 songs and not his best ones.
4,The Chronicles of Conan Vol. 4,It is great to have a collection of Barry Smiths` last and arguably best work on Marvel comics CTB from the mid 70`s. The art is recolored and on premium paper which brings Smiths` work to a polish far more brilliantly that the old comic pulp paper ever could.
4,Super Reader,"An excellent reprint. The introduction of Red Sonja, even if toned down slightly due to comics code demands. Excellent example of Windsor-Smith's fine Conan work. Valeria is in here as well, definitely worth a look. The introduction is excellent, where Roy Thomas goes into detail into how they create the comics version of Sonja, as opposed to the version that appeared in the Howard story that they cribbed her from."
2,picture confused me,"I thought I would receive two bottles: the big and small, but only got the small, suppose that the image does not correspond exactly to the product, disappointed :s"
4,It is not all you need,"If you are buying this for a Skill router you have to buy a holder to go with it.,SKIL Template Guide Adaptor, Model RAS140."
3,your basic guide bushings,"The bushing worked fine, but after about two weeks of frustration with my $59.00 skil router I put it in the rercycle bin and purchased a better router"
5,Heartfelt and powerful,"The Lilly brothers and Don Strover sing in a simple, direct and honest way. They are not slick, phoney or contrived.The sound is raw and realistic,not the ""over-cooked"" mixing found in many ""bluegrass"" albums. Every song on this album is very good -- great string work and harmonic singing. If you like real mountain gospel music this album is a must along with the album ""CRY FROM THE CROSS"" by Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys."
4,A real curiosity !,"The plot of ""The girl from Rio"" is quite simple: Sumuru and her army of women want to exterminate the whole human male gender. Actions scenes are not the best moments of this movie. The interest is somewhere else. It's much more its weird and wild atmosphere, which will enjoy the Franco aficionados. It's difficult not to be fascinated by the world of Femina City, the lair of the female warriors. Shirley Eaton and Maria Rohm are simply amazing in all her sexy suits and there is also a wonderful song called of course ""The girl from Rio"". The final scene on the ship is a typical example for Franco's touch!The quality of this DVD is in a good shape. As Bonus we have some interviews of Jess Franco, Harry Alan Towers and the very natural Shirley Eaton. A lot of posters and stills complete this DVD with of course a Jess Franco bio and some facts of Sumuru.""The girl from Rio"" is a real curiosity and I'm sure Franco friends will enjoy it. Blue Underground did again a fine job."
3,JESS FRANCO FUN,"The ever dodgy JESS FRANCO directs a pretty good flick with this one. GIRL FROM RIO is absolute cheese, largely incomprehensible, but benefits from a fun score and silly 60's costumes for the female army.This is actually sillier than any episode of WONDER WOMAN with it's island of all women. In GIRL FROM RIO there exists a city of all women called FEMINA. It is ruled by the mysterious SUMURU (Shirley Eaton). Oddly enough the name SUMURU never appears in the credits but only in the film. In the credits she is billed as SUMITRA...whatever.The best part apart this DVD are the extras where JESS FRANCO and SHIRLEY EATON kind of trash each other. JESS FRANCO saying that SHIRLEY EATON was 'unworthy' of legend status and EATON grumbling about FRANCO shooting a lesbian scene involving her character using a body double.GIRL FROM RIO is still frustrating FRANCO and does not compare to brilliant FRANCO films like THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z, and VAMPYRO (...)."
1,This is not the original movie: million eyes of Sumuru,"This movie is incredibly slow, unexciting and dull.I have bought it because I saw a couple of scenes from ""million eyes of sumuru"" and stupidly thought that ""thegirl from rio"" was just a new title given to an old movie, million eyes, in fact.as this is not the case and for some odd reason ""million eyes of sumuru"" is not available on DVD or VHS I suggest you to lobby for the issue of million eyes better than buying this stupid movie."
1,The Girl from Rio,"Actually, I thought I ordered Girl from Rio and instead this one was delivered. I've ordered again and I hope this time it will be alright.About the film, no coments. Besides the rare scenes of the Rio old street carnival, it was a junk. Well, maybe I should consider some because it was produced in the 60's I guess(?), but seriously, it shouldn't even be in the list of your distinct company's list of DVDs."
1,This is horrible,"OK, I am a really big blink fan. I have been ever since Enema of the State came out but when I got this video for christmas a couple days after I got it I watched it and found out this video was horrible. I watched the first five minutes of it and then I just had to turn it off.First of all it had on it was all this junk about Porno stars and everything. I think the only relation to blink 182 this would have is their name on the video and that Janine from their album cover used to be a Porn star. This movie is horrible and I think if Mark, Tom, or Travis saw this they might find it a tad bit funny but might be annoyed by the fact that their name is on it and it has barely anything about them on it. This is a horrible video and I would not recommend buying at whatever age you may be."
2,Blink 182 Probed,"This video is not that good. It has no music, it has nothing to do with Blink 182, and it's not funny at all. I recommend you get their other video Urethra Chronicles cause that video is histaricle. This video was poorly made and seriously not worth your time or money."
1,Waste of time and money,"I am a huge Blink 182 fan. I have seen them 10 times in the past years. This band has helped me grow. Urethra Chronicles I and II are the funniest and best DVD's I own. However, Blink 182: Probed + Unauthorized was the biggest waste of time and money I've experienced in a long time! It consisted of a bunch of interviews with no-name people and NO live blink footage or videos. PLEASE do not waste your time; Instead, spend it on UC I and II and blink's CDs!"
1,This DVD is STOOPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You do NOT want this DVD. Here's the what it basically is:-it begins with a picture of all 3 guys and scrolls their names in front of each band member. problem is that whoever made this stupid DVD mixed up mark and tom, so immediately the whole DVD is ruined-a long-haired idiot who wears glasses trying to talk like he's cool and knows blink-182. he periodically shows up throughout the DVD with his stupid hair-interviews with a jonathen davis-wannabe, a porn star, a tattoo artist, and two random nobodys-a 15-minute piece on the girl who kissed travis in the ""All The Small Things"" video and how she feels about it now-clips of a random skater-clips of fans from englandthat's about it. the band's apperance on the DVD, when all put together, lasts about 5-6 minutes. the music's not even by blink. spend your money on something less crappy."
1,stay away from this one,"i purchased this video and it was horrible. it was so horrible in fact that i broke it. it has no music or concerts by blink and if it didn't say on the cover you wouldn't know it had anything to do with Blink 182. if you're considering buying this, don't, buy the Urethra Chronicles instead. i have that and it's great. don't buy this. it is a waste of plastic."
1,Not everything is in this Encyclopedia,"I barely used this during nursing school, and when I did, the topic wasn't in the book. Save your money and just ""google"" things."
1,waste of space and paper,"when my friend told me about this book, i laughed, i read some extracts from it and laughed even harder. i have never ever read a book as funny as this one. and then reading the reviews were really funny. those who believe in this book really need to sit down and read a bio book. the last post, the outstanding one is the funniest, get a life people AIDS is real and is not going away any time soon. who ever published this book is also a waste of space..."
1,idiots,"i hope more people like the other people who have written reviews on this waste of paper read this book, so they'll die of the aids hoax they dont have."
1,Such Tomfoolery,"Alas, this tome is filled this tomfoolery and idiocy. Why only in times days gone by my hireling was piloting my motorcoach down the thoroughfare are I spoted a local dandy with the AIDS."
4,Suunto Advizor,"Pros:1. Great watch with a TON of features. Not many compass, altimeter, barometer combo watches also come with a heart rate monitor. That's impressive.2. This is one of the best styled watches I've ever owned.3. Very comfortable and easy wearing band.Cons:1. Suunto Watches have terrible function navigation. There is no intuitive function design to these watches.2. I use a stopwatch often and the stopwatch function can only be accessed through another function - which was a big negative for me causing me to give the watch away to a friend."
2,Functional but cheap feel,"The watch does everything it's supposed to do, but it's got a cheap feel to it(does not feel rugged like you would expect from an adventure watch). Would have liked to have a calorie counter with the heart rate monitor. Menu's are difficult to navigate."
1,Don't lose your receipt,"I've had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months. I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken-off, like the other reviewer. I dont have my receipt. You can go to the Suunto website, but one thing you won't find there is an address with a note that says:""send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it.""My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.So I give the Suunto one star, for being adventure-cool for a while. A lot of other Infantrymen own these, so I jumped on the bandwagon. I wish I had stuck with a regular watch and a GPS (with lensatic compass backup)."
3,Some troubles,"Good watch. I had some troubles but I send it to service twice and now is working well.All info you need for ooutdoors activities plus a Heart monitorYou can change the batery every time you need by your self not sending it to special service, this also with the chest strap.The only complain: no cristal, why an expensive watch uses plastic instead mineral cristal or saphire cristal?"
1,welcome to the jungle,again this is not the CD that I am not wanting it is not what I want so I have to send it back to you.
2,Not bad,"Good renditions, for sure. Definitely some unique artists here. Love the female take on ""Civil War"". Now THERE is a groundbreaking effort. However, weren't the originals good enough? The recording quality isn't up to par with the originals. Listen to how thin a lot of the vocals sound, especially Kevin Dubrow on ""Welcome to the Jungle"". Does anyone remember how much that hit you when Axl came crashing in on the original?Not a bad CD. Just remember -- the originals are better. :)"
5,Anime goes to the Theatre,"This installment of the Sakura Wars OVA's takes the spirit Warriors on various episodic adventures. Unlike the first OVA, there are no great Mech battles...which is OK. The various stories serve to develop the characters more and show the efforts they put into their Theatre Troup and solve mysteries. I actually liked this one better than the First OVA's that came out a few years ago. Dubbing was good. Even though the accents weren't authentic, the actors breathed so much fun into them that I didn't care. Great animation and score as well."
5,Ver y bad!,"don't buy this! its garbage! u should thank me for warning you! YES! I gave it 5 stars because it think it was very not good! Buy it now! And then burn it! Buy as many copies as you can and burn them so no one else has to be subjected to this boring cartoon! they were all speaking jibberish like ""ching chang chong"" and it made no sense! these weird cartoons are all horrible like that dragonballs show! blah!"
2,"Tray is Ok, but wrong hinges",The hinges shipped with the product do not match the ones shown in the product image.
5,A fashion and history buff's delight!,"Susan Langley's book is great for people who enjoy reading about and admiring hats. It is informative, organized and beautiful. Except for the first two sections which comprise 3 decades each, 1770-1800 and 1800-1830, the book is organized by decade. Each section has a wonderful introduction which consists of a historical overview, fashion overview and overview of hats which is devoted solely to that time period. Then come the gorgeous fashion plates, vintage photos of hat-wearing ladies and actual hats on period milliner's heads such as the century old,rooted haired and glassed eyed Alice who is on the cover with the pink picture hat. Also included are advertisements and articles which,though in small print, can still be read. Ms Langley often compares the fashion plates with the photos of hats on the milliner's heads and old photos of women wearing the hats. This is a great book."
5,Hands down - best C complex around,"I did a little research on optimal vitamin C for myself a long while ago and this has the best balance of any on the market.2 capsules contain 500 mg Ester C & 50 mg each of good old fashioned Rose Hips, Acerola, and Citrus Bioflavonoids. 10 mg of the flavinoid Rutin (sometimes referred to as Vitamin P) & 500mg Quercetin a flavonol. Plus 50 mg Bromelain.I'm surprised it hasn't caught on.Quercetin Complex - Helps support health and wellness, 100 Vcaps., (Solgar)This is a well rounded easily tolerated, long(ish) lasting vitamin C complex with anti-inflammatory & antioxidant benefits. I've taken it for years & highly recommend it. Just a bit disappointed it isn't on Amazon Prime. More, that I can't find it at my local store!An interesting note: Quercetin and Rutin have been used as a medication in some countries for blood vessel protection."
2,Ho Hum....,"I cannot honestly say that I have noticed any effect from these caps. I was expecting a boost of sorts, but it just seems like I'm taking a placebo. Maybe it might work for you, but I probably won't but this product again."
4,Finally Reissued On CD!,"Here it is! Finally reissued for the very first time on CD, Denise Lasalle's 1985 album ""Love Talkin"". This album contains Lasalle's big crossover hit ""My Tu-Tu"". Some may be disappointed that the CD contains the short, edited version of the song. This disc also contains the fan fave ""Give Me Your Most Strongest Whiskey"" along with a sassy remake of ZZ Hill's ""Someone Else Is Steppin In"", which Lasalle originally penned for the late singer a few years prior. Overall, this is a very strong effort from the Queen of the Blues. Definately one of her better albums."
1,Nadia saga goes to hell,"In the past 2 weeks, I watched every dvd of the Nadia series and just finished with the motion picture today. I loved the series UNTIL the ripoff motion picture.I agree with all the other reviewers' negative comments. The makers of this film insult the fans of the series.Here are the biggest things offensive about this movie:1. First third are scenes from the earlier episodes. Total waste.2. Opening credits and song vastly inferior to the tv show.3. Nadia left Jean and became a gofer for a newspaper???? Huh???? After almost being ruler of Atlantis she becomes that?4. Grandis, Samson, & Hanson turn against Jean and are thugs again?5. No Marie, King, or any of the Nautilus crew?6. Villian so dull. Gargoyle 1,000,000 times more interesting.7. Terrible story.8. At end of film, Nadia again leaves Jean???!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I love these guys,"and while it's not my favorite album by them (I'm totally biased) I still really like it. This is where you'll hear all of their hits. The cover is amazing in such a big state. Obviously, listen to the band before you buy it. It's not everybody's thing. but it's mine. Very happy to add this to my collection."
3,Love the 180g weight... sound is so-so. (VINYL),"I already have this album that I bought back in 1980. But I wanted a ""fresh"" copy (vinyl), so I got this.Good:- You've got to love the weight of the 180g vinyl!- It sounds just like my original copy.Bad:- It sounds just like my original copy. The highs are over-modulated. The dynamics and clarity don't really come close to my older CD version.- The record (brand new) came pretty warped. It's completely playable and I'll keep it. I just didn't expect this from a new copy- especially a 180g one.- The record came with a hand print and a scratch that looks like someone dropped it on the edge of a table. The damage seems superficial and I'm not worried about it. But still, it seems to speak of the QC here.I just bought this for nostalgia sake so I wasn't expecting ultimate level fidelity. If you are, you might want to wait and see if MOFI will re-release this. At least the price is very fair. (Note that this is for the vinyl copy.)"
4,Received product very quickly and was in great condition.,"This was a CD from my past that I really wanted to own again. Since my purchase, I now own an iphone, and will probably not be purchasing physical cd/albums any long. Price was great tool"
2,More political BS than technical,"You may be very disappointed if you don't have a good look at this book before you buy it. It would be great for a manager in the political (vs. technical sysadmin) sense. But it's short on technical ""meat"", and long on general concepts."
5,Can't get it to work with Win7,"I've had ""Totally Mad"" since it came out (they couldn't give me the toilet paper, but they gave me a Mad Mousepad). I've used it through Win95, 2000, and XP, but I am having problems with Win7 (The first disk will load under Win7 but the it rejects the other disks) and yes, it's no longer updated and supported. Yes there is now a ""Absolutely Mad"" (which has more issues) on one DVD but ""Totally Mad"" has a better search feature and bonuses of Videos, Mad Songs etc., outside of just the issues.I'm going to keep it anyway, maybe load it on a old laptop with XP or something."
4,Works fine with Vista,"This set requires that you install only the basic program (contained on disc 1) on your computer hard drive in order to use or view the rest of the set. You then must insert the disc containing the issues you want to view in your CD ROM drive as needed. This does not take up much space at all by today's standards. I just did so on my computer equipped with windows Vista. I have not tried every feature, but for simply viewing all content, it works perfectly. The only problem I have had is that the ""help"" section is not compatible with Vista. This is a very minor inconvenience considering how easy it is to maneuver through all of the magazine covers and issues."
5,A Great Collection of Ministry Videos...,"...and even some Revolting Cocks videos thrown in for good measure. Ministry was always a powerhouse industrial-metal group, and their music makes a bold statement of how to rock and how to rock loud. TAPES OF WRATH showcases videos from much of their career (discounting the drag of WITH SYMPATHY). The best videos on the disc are the timeless ""Just One Fix"" with its deep-rooted images, some frightening. Also, the industrial and darkly comedic ""N.W.O."" is another classic, as well as the early ""Stigmata"" and ""Burning Inside"" videos. If you are a true Ministry fan, you'll want to pick this up along with the SPHINCTOUR dvd. Also very worthy for the two Revolting Cocks videos for ""Crackin' Up"" and ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"", which are both funny and brilliant."
5,Wow,"All I cna say is WOW! Being a huge fan I was most impressed by this DVD. We have been waiting for something like this to be released. I don't need to expound any further really. All fans buy this, get your credit card and buy it now."
1,Tapes of Trash!,"This is quite possibly the WORST DVD in my collection. Stereo Sound (What happened to Dolby 5.1?), poor visuals (but that was expected), absolutely NO EXTRAS... I will definitely think twice before purchasing ANYTHING further from Ministry, which is really unfortunate, as they used to be one of my favorite bands. The REVCO vids at the end was the sole nice touch to an otherwise unfortunate purchase. This DVD makes me really wonder if a REVCO DVD were to ever come out&#65533;would I purchase it?...see if you can borrow it from a friend or rent it, because it isn&#65533;t worth buying."
1,Ministry-Tapes of Wrath,"Why does Ministry continue to try to pretend that their first few albums don't exist? This is their best stuff! Before they got all whacked-out, their first few albums contained some GREAT music - Work For Love, Everyday is Halloween, etc. Now they just pretend that ""must have been a different band"" and try to distance themselves from it. How come? They USED to make some GREAT music!"
2,"Great music, disappointing videos","I am a huge fan of Ministry. I think Al Jourgenson has made some of the most original music ever made. (This is hidden from view by the hardcore image the group has.)But the videos are... well, basically I think that if you hired a random film school student and turned him loose with some concert footage and a random video clip archive, you'd probably get some better videos. I honestly don't understand what they are doing. All of it is violent, underexposed, handheld footage from documentary TV, cut together seemingly with little system or idea.It is not *all* bad. ""Just One Fix"" for instance is genuinely frightening. But what is a closeup of writhing maggots doing in ""Lay Lady Lay""?"
4,"Ok, it's not the best stuff it could be..","When one reviews this DVD then one has to first remember that we are talking about Ministry, quite possibly the best and most original band in the world right now. But, the material you'll find here is definately lacking in regard to what's....missing (...)...True, classics like ""psalm 69"" or ""NWO"" are on it but i am of the opinion that the best songs are on Ministry's ""Filthpig"" and ""Dark side of the spoon"" and sadly you will only find 2 f those songs here. There is also no interview material at all, no backstage material, well, nothing of that sort. Still this is a Ministry DVD and as such it is a MUST (esp. when one considers the [stuff] out there) and thus it gets a 4 from me. Could it be way-way better? Yes it could. Should you still have it if you appreciate good music and relevant bands? Yes you should."
3,"Definitely ""full-sized""","Unlike most Skagen watches, the 281LSXB watch casing is too tall, wide, and long to look good on slim or medium wrists. It might look appropriate on men with large arms, wrists, & hands.The build quality is good for the price, but the designers need to figure out how to scale down the size while still making the two sets of hands easy to read from a distance.Also remember that, unlike the famous Skagen mesh bands which can be resized by the user, this steel bracelet band must be resized by a jeweler."
2,Good book for a beginning,"After going over this book and CD many times I took the 216 test. Was surprised by just how much information this book is lacking for the test. At least a quarter of my test was composed of DHCP Relay questions, so brush yourself up on it a lot since the book has nothing on the subject. Good testing otherwise!"
2,Needs more indepth descriptions,"This book is great for actually stepping through installing and configuring the infrastructure. All chapters have sections that have screen shots and how to instructions. However, if you are trying to pass the 70-217 you need more than step by step how to instructions. You need answers to why something works, and this book does not provide those answers."
3,Good Base,"The book is fairly detailed but there are a couple of mistakes. The ExamGear software that comes with it has numerous errors. New Riders has nothing (as of yet) on their web site to correct these errors. The book is laid out good (follows the MS exam prep guide), and the exercises were somewhat helpful. You really need to dig into the product to pass the test for this. I setup and used extensively; NAT, ICS, WINS, DHCP, VPN, DNS, and AD. This book will help you understand these areas but it's up to you use the product and to understand it."
1,do NOT buy,"I gave it 1 star only because I had to in order to rate it. This DVD is just terrible! The Wild Things are ugly and scary and the music makes it worse. In the 2nd story, one of the songs is about manners and shows a spoiled, rotten kid. He straightens up by the end of the song but he's already driven home his ""I don't care"" message to children watching it. In the last story about the little boy, first he gets naked and then these bakers stir him in some batter with his hand sticking out of the mix and they put him in the oven. If that's not enough, by the end the little boy shows his privates! I looked at the ratings here before I bought it and can't believe this has 4 1/2 stars. Don't be fooled just because it's from Scholastic. I would give this zero stars if I could."
4,Great product for the price!,We received the dvd and my grandson loved it! I worried about buying used but my fears were unfounded with this product.
4,My kids love this!,"""Wild Things"" was one of my favorite books as a kid, and my kids enjoy watching this video. My 6.5 yr old son hums and sings the catchy tunes of ""I don't care..."" and ""chicken soup with rice..."". My 4.5 yr old daughter enjoys it, beginning to end. It is different from your everyday animated videos, and I think that's part of why it captures their attention."
4,She LOVES her 'Monstewrs'...,"Our 2-yr-old daughter LOVES this entire DVD. The 'Wild Things' story seems a bit scary to me but she requests it again and again and again. The Alligators All Around & Night Kitchen are adorable and the narration in song by Carole King is so unique, so warm & so engaging. It's actually one of her few DVDs that don't grate on Mom & Dad's nerves - a big bonus!!"
3,Overall good,Where The Wild Things Are is great but In The Night Kitchen shows a little boy in the kitchen at night and he is wearing no clothes. I was disappointed that scholastic would put this on a dvd.
4,good video,"Several of the reviews were negative...I found this video to be as good as any other in the Scholastic series. My 3 year old likes it, especially the middle segment where Carole King sings the stories. The last story - In the Night Kitchen, is a little odd, but we have the book, so the naked baby thing didn't bother me. I would say it'd worth purchasing (if your kid likes Where the Wild Things Are, or if you're a nostalgic adult, I'd recommend it)."
5,A Great Book,"This is truly a marvelous book on Bayesian survival analysis.The authors, who are true experts in the field, have writtena gem that covers modern Bayesian methods in survival analysis.They have a nice blend between modeling, theory, and applicationsthat truly makes this book the first of its kind. It has somevery nicely written chapters on semiparametric models based onprior processes and frailty models. The book is very extensivein its coverage and has a very long bibliography. This book isgoing to be a best seller for a long time."
5,Bayesian survival analysis,"This is a very well written book and the first of its kind on Bayesian survival analysis. The authors have a very keen sense of the important issues and models in this area, and they do a wonderful job of presenting the various topics. The book discusses state-of-the-art methods for fitting Bayesian survival models. The content on the power prior and its uses in survival analysis was very exciting. The motivating examples in Chapter 1 were novel and very appealing. The authors have a great deal of experience in this area and in the applications they present. I definitely recommend buying this book. It serves as an exceptional reference or textbook."
3,False advertizing,"This is blatent false advertizing. The are no complete matches on it and their are no special fetures. Don't be fooled by the other reviews, this is not worth anthing above $4.If you like clips and interviews, then by all means, get it; bt you wanted to see the actual matches then you are out of luck."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,"This dvd is only 60 mins long with no full matches, it really sux, i want my money back it is way overpriced. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD"
5,Entertaining and well written fun.,"I did'nt know how this book was gonna be, but based on the back I thought I'd give it a try, IT WAS GREAT. Matthew clearly has talent as an author, his sarcastic humor leaves nothing to be desired. The Plot: A male prostitute who is strictly 'top' with his customers, has a attraction towards his husky roomate Andrew, and who in turn is admired by his other twink-like roomy Joe. Sounds like a catastrophe waiting to happen..."
1,Unimaginative and pretentious,"This could have been written by a homophobe. The writing is perhaps adequate...the story is lacking and the characters predictible. Nothing of value, in this book."
5,Charming,"""The wry, funny story of a hustler's confessions and the twisted love triangle he finds himself in when he discovers how messy uncommissioned and unrequited lust can be. A wonderful, charming first novel."" - review from Stonewall Inn"
4,A fun romp...so to speak.,"Boy Culture takes us into the mind of a Chicago-based prostitute who is having trouble discerning the fine lines between love and sex. Boy Culture is a laugh a minute ride and an easy read. The only problem with the book is that there is never a real sense of guilt on the part of the prostitute who only wishes to be known as ""X."" Since each chapter is labeled a ""confession"" and the narrator/prostitute wishes to secure his anonymity, one would think that he would deal with his guilt-factor in his profession. However, this may be the only hole in the book. Boy Culture provides a realistic look at what it means to be a gay man in the 90's."
1,Really awful,"If you like reading about a self-absorbed painfully unfunny character (even though the author apparently thinks that there is humor here), you will love this book. Nothing new, here."
4,BOY CULTURE,I FOUND THE MOVIE VERY ENJOYABLE AND INTERESTING. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE THAT HAS THE LIKING FOR YOUNG MEN IN THE EARLY 20'S.
2,Couldn't make it past chapter 4 though friends liked it,"I had the same experience with this as I did with one of Rettenmund's other books (Blind Items). Several friends recommended it, it seemed like a good and fun topic, and yet I could not make it past chapter 4. Rettenmund's writing style reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper: The articles go on for pages and pages to say something that could be said in two paragraphs. If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you. Personally it drove me crazy."
1,Horrible Read..,"I've been on a reading streak where I've been reading pretty much any book I can get my hands on. This book nearly killed it. The writing was awful and the characters were horrible. I felt really bad for Matthew Rettenmund's thesaurus because I'm sure it was mangled by the time he got through with writing this book. The book was full of unrealistic dialouge and painfully unwitty and unfunny observations. The main character was frustratingly arrogant and unbearable. My only motivation to finish this book was to write a bad review of it here and move on to other, better books. People need to be warned!"
5,"Funny, witty, and just insightful enough","Call me crazy, but I *liked* ""X."" Through his confessions, the reader gets just enough of an idea as to why he is a cynical prostitute, and how his experiences with his parents, cousin, and others have wounded him, without revealing more than this character is capable of. ""X,"" after all, never seemed the type to wear his heart on his sleeve, so why should he turn into some kind of sentimental mush at the end, or even change a great deal? My only wish is that we could have seen more develop between ""X"" and Joe, though I am glad our young friend was given a happy ending. (We all need happy endings sometimes!)"
3,"A Tart of a novel, fluffy.","The author's first novel is fine. Not grand writing, but fun, funny, and pure pulp. Breeze through this book. Revel in the relationship turmoil, fantasize about going to a redneck marriage with your boyfriend, and read the sins of a call boy.Good, fun, reading."
3,Review of Boy Culture,"I didn't find Boy Culture to be screamingly funny as I think it's advertised. However, not that I would know firsthand, it appeared to be an intelligent rendering of the psyche of a male prostitute conditioned to protect himself from love. The central love triangle is written well enough to give the book some tension. If you're looking for a ""fun"" or ""witty"" gay novel, I'd sooner suggest Christian McLaughlin or Joe Keenan. If you're interested in reading a novel about a male prostitute, with the possible exception of Rent Boy by Gary Indiana, I'd say this book among the most literary I've read."
4,Cute and affordable little table.,"Love this item! I bought two of them to flank either side of the French doors to our study. They are easy to put together, well made, cute ""shabby chic"" style. They are definitely small in depth and width, which is exactly what I was looking for so I am really pleased with them! I have had several compliments, and when I tell friends how inexpensive they were, they are all surprised! I would give it five stars, but the only complaint I have is that each of the table parts are labeled with stickers...they didn't peel off nice and clean, and it took me a while to get the last remnants of sticker shreds off each piece. Pet peave of mine...Oh well!"
3,Should be called Mario's greatest games,"As others have mentioned, some of the game selections are rather poor. They seem to have chosen games where the Pens scored a lot of points, not necesarily games that were very intense. I also own the Edmonton Oilers 10 greatest games, and the selection of games were MUCH better - they have some from every era (Wayne, post Wayne, and recent from their last cup run). They had only 1 blowout, and that was a stanely cup winning game, so I can forgive it. Most the games were close, very exciting, and very intense.A couple of the Pittsburgh games have been that, but mostly it seems to be a collection of high-scoring games, where Mario gets 5-8 points, and the Pens steamroll someone. That kind of thing is fine for 1 or 2 of the games, but when it seems to be half of them or more, it gets old, especially when the Pens have so many great games to choose from."
3,Crosby games already?,"I'm guessing, maybe HOPING, that there aren't many pre 80's games available in their entirety. They 5 goal 5 ways, Mario's first game ever, clinching the Rangers series without Mario and Joey, even the series loser against the Isles dynasty should have been included. Perhaps th Primeau game as well? Here's hoping for volume II."
2,poor choice of games,"I was looking forward to buying this, but must say how disapointed I am in the game selection. There are only 3 games on there worthy of consideration, with several obvious poor choices. The 4 overtime game againts the capitals? who wants to sit through that? Your kidding me, right? Marios comeback from retirement? Surely there are better choices. The Francis goal against the rangers that saved the series and game 1 from the 92 finals are clearly much more exciting games than either of those. Anyway, I wont be buying this now and can only wonder what the producers were thinking?"
3,Polenta was not part of the Roman soldier diet,Whoops! Know your history! Roman soldiers did not have polenta in their diet. Corn is native to the New World and was not brought to the Old World until well after the Roman Empire had declined.
1,the worse movie ever made in Amsterdam,This movie was anounced big in Amsterdam. and expatations were high. But it was a total flop. The worst movie ever made in Amsterdam. It got several golden unions (the dutch raspberry movieprice)
1,a good one to miss,"This was a difficult movie to watch. The movie has been dubbed into english but the voice overs are done poorly and the voices don't fit the characters. I thought I could get past this...but, not so much. The plot was a bit out-there and the characters were a bit predictable, decidant, and self-absorbed. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this movie..."
3,Nice watch,"it's a nice watch but depending on the sun light you can't see the numbers, also when your are in the shadows... everything else works as it says the catalog..."
4,Not bad,"I've had the watch about one month. The band is a little stiff and difficult to get on but comfortable once in place. I guess this is an improvement in durability over the older model leather bands. Being a lifetime casio owner I found the menus and information accessibility less than intuitive. The light is weak and is only really helpful when in very dark conditions. Everything still works which, if it continues to work for the next year, will be an improvement over the 5 casio pathfinders I've owned."
3,After 4 years of use...,"PROS:1. Awesome wrist-computer, tons of functions and very precise.2. Looks great3. For what you get it is a fair priceCONS:1. It is not truly waterproof.2. Beyond the basic functions the operation is very complex. Not intuitive.3. With heavy use the case is prone to deformation and bruising because of the malleable nature of aluminum. This eventually affects the operations of the buttons.I work as a naturalist guide in Costa Rica, and this watch has been with me for over four years, looking for wildlife in the rain forest. After a year or so water began to make its way into the watch, I do not expose it to rain unnecessarily anymore. For me this is it's biggest con.Just be careful not to bang it as the aluminum can only take so much. Suunto still makes the best wrist computers in the market. With everything I have put it trough it is still running!If I buy a Suunto again I will go for steel or titanium."
2,Bad experience with purchasing X-Lander on Amazon,"Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:1. ""Usually ships in 24 hours"". It actually took 1 week to ship it.2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have ""leather band"". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.I will have to return it."
2,Too techy,"If you don't mind a complicated watch, you may like this one. The face is very large but not very easy to see with its monochromatic coloring. Its lightweight for the size but I'm sending this one back for a refund."
3,very cool watch. quality could be a little better.,i cant for the life of me figure out how to convert from metric to imperial. and the band has been discolored for some reason i cant tell why but it has a bunch of gray spots. other then that i really like it.
3,satisfactory,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BV7PQK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlesome feature is straight forward such as watch, compass, but others are difficult to manage, esoecially difficult is altimeter. how to get absolute high when you are flying on airplane?"
2,Bought and returned,I bought this watch and found it to be too big. Even though its smaller than earlier models it still takes up too much room on my wrist. Be sure you try one before ordering online.
2,DONT WEAR IN THE SHOWER,"Fogs up in the shower. I do everything with my watch on; but I must take it off when I take a shower...WTF. I work in a marine environment (tugboats) and I am scared that Ill ruin the watch if I accidentally get it wet.I purchased this watch from Ebay...and replaced the battery / battery door / strap. I do love the look of it and the features, but if I cant use it on the water its not very useful to me.I ended up getting a casio G shock Mudman with a Compass/Temp...so Far its been great."
2,Way too big,I bought this watch because I wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size. It is HUGE - looked like I had a clock on my wrist. Take into consideration.
1,"Pricey, Fragile, Dead in a week",I wore it to the gym and office for a week and one of mode buttons fell off. I did not notice it falling off at the time so I assume I did not bump it hard and there was nomark on my wrist or on the watch other than the missing button. Military???? I think not.
3,BIGTOXY69,Early & I mean Early Jack nicholson !!! - Not a bad movie for It's Time But You can Find it The budget racks of Dollar Stores & Big Lt's For a Pitance !!!! I'm not Sure it may even be Public Domain ? in which case you can Download it For Free Legally ! I'd not pay much more than @ bucks for The Terror Personally FWIW ?
2,Corman quickie,"This is an absolutely terrible movie, but well worth having in the collection if only to see Jack Nicholson slim and with hair and young. Made in 5 days, yes only 5 days, on the sets used for The Raven, this is one of the best bad films ever made, and as such is hugely enjoyable. Consider it as part of Corman's Edgar Allen Poe series and you will know what you are getting.It's quite short too....."
5,Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia L-Z Volume 2,"The product was shipped in a timely manner, the book was in great condition. This seller surpassed my expectations and for such a low price. I will definitely buy from this seller again."
2,More than a little disappointed....,"Sorry to say that Craig's coverage of Mugai-ryu Iaido, as taught by Shogo Kuniba, is less than accurate. Having also been a student of Kuniba, I see a large number of inconsistencies in the text and illustrations.Craig's general info is very good regarding sword nomenclature and philosophy, however, so I consider it a decent addition to any library concerning Japanese Swordsmanship, as long as the reader is aware of some of the drawbacks regarding Mugai-ryu."
4,An excellent primer to the art.,"IAI- The Art of Drawing the sword is a great place for someone to start their study of iaido. Punctuated with interesting tidbits of info (though I am at a loss as to why so much space was devoted to sword-testing on corpses and on the proper procedure for seppuku), it explains in simple terms the basic movements and kata. A must have for anyone interested in the practice of the Katana or Daito."
4,"Oldie, but goodie","I say ""oldie"" because the All Japan Kendo Federation has added several new kata to its regimen since the book was published. But the description ""goodie"" still fits! There's a bit of something for everyone in this book: stories, history, philosophy, and practical tips.As always, I'm grateful for the many thoughtful reviews here on Amazon. I'm surprised, however, that so many folks think a BOOK is the way to learn any martial art, especially a traditional one like iaido. If you're serious about learning iai (and not just reading about it), find a qualified, respected instructor and practice, practice, practice. Then buy this book as a supplement to your education."
4,A different philosophical outlook,"The book is a very interesting read for fencers of all kinds, especially USFA and SCA'ers looking to ""branch out"". While I can't comment on its consistency with other Oriental arts, Iai does cover a whole area of thought and philosophy usually ignored in Occidental fencing: drawing the sword."
1,Wow...,"It's a crying shame that someone is passing this off as a REAL Louis Vuitton wallet. I know that some people might not know how to spot a fake, but they couldn't miss this."
2,No benefit...potential hazards,"I am a physician( M.D.)starting my fourth bottle of this product, which I started on the advice of my physician brother-in-law. I am 69 years old, very healthy, but have a torn medial meniscus, but with minimal symptoms: squatting is nearly impossible. Soon after starting the third bottle, I started having a lot of intestinal gas (flatulence) and diarrhea, which have worsened as I started my fourth bottle. I finally stopped these pills, and after two weeks of ""wash out"" am back to normal. I have had no improvement from this product and nothing but grief!"
5,It Works!,"I tried this item after years of knee pain, and my knee locking every time I bent down. After taking 2 pills a day for 2 weeks all symtems went away. I still take 2 a day, and walk 3 miles a day pain free. I am 64 years old. I am thankful for this product."
1,Do not take this product,"I fear this is a much more dangerous product than people realize. After 4 days of two pills two times per day, as recommended, I was in pain. Not just the gastrointestinal stuff that others have mentioned, I also had horrendous pain in my upper legs and knees. Pain to the point that I was in tears. Originally I took the product for pain in my hip where I am arthritic. After going on line and reading the reviews posted here, I decided not to take Move Free anymore. Lo and behold, the leg pain was gone in 24 hours, as quickly as it appeared. I even tried to research this product on line before I bought it, but evidently missed these reviews. I couldn't find a lot of feedback. This is defintely a buyer beware."
1,made me violently sick,"This product made me so sick I thought I was going to die! Had severe watery diarrhea and violent vomiting!! It was terrible. I have taken other brands of glucosamine-chrondroitin and had no problems so it's clearly not those two ingredients. Some people are sensitive/allergic to something in Move Free's formula. If you're not one of them, it might work for you. If you are, beware you're in for about a 12 hour period of severe misery beginning several hours after you take it."
1,Made me sick!,"This product makes me very sick: nausea, diarrhea, dehydration. I'm not sure what ingredient causes these symptoms in some people. I routinely take Wellesse liquid glucosamine with no problems but only use the Schiff tables when traveling. After 3 trips I finally figured out I was not experiencing food poisoning from eating on the road, but a direct correlation between taking these tablets and becoming very sick within hours."
1,Joint Pain After Taking Move Free,"As mentioned by others here I also had severe pain in the knee that I was taking this product for. I noticed it after not taking it for a few days and had no pain. When I again took Move Free, my pain came back. Stopped for a few days once more and tried it again... pain came back again."
1,I was so sick after taking 4 tablets,"I had a terrible reaction to MOVE FREE. It gave me nausea, severe diarrhea, gas and severe stomach pain. It was so bad I could not stand up straight. I was sick for three days. The directions said to take four tablets a day for two weeks.SCHIFF MOVE FREE ADVANCED 140 TABLETS JOINT GLUCOSAMINETwo in the morning and two in the evening. I was sick the next day. BEWARE"
2,A few have bad reactions & I'm one of them,It took me the longest time to figure out the cause of my stomach cramps and diarrhea - otherwise the stuff seems to work OK. Just read the reviews - so now I know. I don't think it's worth it. I wish Schiff would have given a heads up for the few of us that have bad intestinal problems.
1,Like Public Health Doc Diarrhea Requiring Hospitalization,Be careful with this formula. If you try it watch for Explosive Diarrhea. I got so dehydrated from the diarrhea I was hospitalized for three days to get fluids in balance and my kidneys almost shut down. Be aware of all symptoms after starting this product and discontinue immediately if gastro intestinal distress occurs.
3,Love the band....not the DVD,"The After Dark DVD does provide some excellent insight into the band and it does include all of their videos up to the time when this DVD was made. However, I feel like there should have been some more live footage of the band included. The chatting that occurs between each video is a lot of fun to watch the first time but it gets old with subsequent viewings. Same with the band's commentary. Instead of being so ""chatty"", this DVD could have used 30-40 minutes of live... TON music. One more problem with the disk that might drive you crazy is the fact that there is no chapter selection feature. If you want to watch just a few of the videos and not all the talking, you have to fast forward to them from the beginning of the disk everytime...I'm giving this one 3 stars only because I like the band so much. I hope that as they release future DVD's, TON will hire a more competent DVD engineering team."
4,type o negative--after dark,"what you cant get from the video version of after dark comes in the DVD version. the commentary is...well, funny (seems like a whole lotta inside jokes. ill admit to being lost during some parts)and shows the boys being themselves. parts of the commentary, for some reason, are bleeped out (who knows why, i certainly dont) the dvd includes a photo section(not never before seen), band bios (which are also on the website--typeonegative.net) and two tracks that are amazing and will be released on the ""least worst of"" album. it's great stuff. well worth the money. :o) (side note--if you ever wanted to know what the band really thinks of the videos,etc, this is definatly for you. lotsa ranting and raving durring the commentary)"
4,Type O videos rock!,"I love these videos. Too bad MTV doesn't show videos anymore. Type O fans out there should also check out their other DVD Nosferatu. They did the entire soundtrack (new stuff) for the silent version of this horror movie - don't think the tracks are available elsewhere. Kind of wierd to watch a horror movie and listen to O-, but close your eyes and it's like you're listening to their long lost album! Can't wait to catch these guys in concert."
5,For those who love music,"This is probably the best ""music"" video put out by a band. Not only do you get the band's collection of videos, but you get a great look at the personalities of the bandmembers. A must-own for any Type O Negative fan."
2,short circut,This item is very easy to use just dont let the key pad fall from your belt too many times. The headset easily shorts out. I haven't even had it a month before the headset shorted out
1,Battery life,"We have had the phone for over two years (puts us in the minority). I will not try to tell stories about being an engineer or a sales consultant for large phone corporations. I will just say that I worked with electronics for over 37 ears. With that out of the way, here are the comments on this phone. SPEND...MORE and get a phone that will last for more than a year. Battery life is short, about 30 minutes. Be sure and let the batteries drain completely once a month or the recharge will be useless. Try to find a replacement battery. I did after emailing several companies. The model number of the battery doesn't even show up in search engines. The replacement battery is not made by the OEM.... The beltclip allows the phone to fall, (be sure and catch the phone or it will try to pull the hardwired cord out of the box). ] GE builds great locomotives, not phones."
4,What happens after 2 years?,"I have had this phone for about 2 years and it works great. The sound is reasonable and the volume control is a plus, along with the mute button.I didn't like the little arm that supported the headset; it just made the hanging wire look bad. Then there is the extra battery - GREAT idea. Just that the spare is ""dead"" now. Started dying after about 6 months.The cushion earpiece is sloooooowly disintegrating and cannot be replaced because everything is just ""fixed"". It would have been good if some components were detachable and could be replaced.All in all, a great phone for the price. Now I just need to contemplate purchasing a new battery or another phone."
2,Not my idea of a cordless phone,"The phone had been dropped just a couple of times & fell off the waist of my pants and after a week since the purchase the microphone of the headset stopped working. The unfortunate thing is we cannot change just the headset we would have to replace the whole phone altogether. I went to the GE website and could not find the phone or replacement parts. I will never purchase this phone again. I ended up ordering a different brand with the option to replace just the headset, if need be."
3,Not So Impressed,"I wasn't very satisfied with this volume.Don't get me wrong,I love this series.I currently own the first four volumes,but this one just didn't cut it.The stories weren't appealing.Hardly any comedy at all.But it was still overall okay.I still recommend the series because voulme four gets the story back in line.It is a very fun series."
4,This cd is cool,"This cd is aight....but its not as good as Poetic Hustlaz cd. 2-tru definatly got skillz, but this cd coulda been better....Bone is on a couple songs on this album which can only help the cd. If u are a hardcore fan of MO Thugs, buy this cd! If u are not a hardcore fan, u should listen first b4 u buy this cd and decide for yourself."
4,"Adequate, especially for the price","This portable potty works well enough; I mean, how exciting can a product like this be? The simple pump works perfectly well if you prime it slightly. Just add some water in the pump well and you're good to go. I had to figure it out on my own. It was the best priced one I could find with the features that I wanted. I thought this size was perfect: not too large but not too small."
3,Intruiging,My daughter and I read this book together and with each page you look for the letter that it talks about. I gotta tell you there were many pages in which we were stumped! It got so that we both lost the point of the story and just looked for the letter in the illustrations. My daughter liked this book but I personally have seen better alphabet books.
4,Band is too small!,"I love this watch, it looks nice, it goes with everything. The only downside is that the watch band is so small. I am a small framed woman and can barely fit it to the second to last notch. I do not recommend this watch if you have average sized wrists or above."
4,Great!,"I love this watch! My only complaint is the indigloo feature only lights up the middle so you can see the hands and it's hard to read the numbers. Otherwise, great watch!"
3,ok but face is too small,face on watch is smaller than what I wanted and the band looks like it is skimpy - next time I'll buy the watch in person
2,Not as expected,From the original price I thought the watch would look much nicer than it does. I bought this watch as a gift and was very disappointed. I expected more from Timex also.
4,A good everyday watch.,"This Timex is very nice. It has a very clear, easy to read face. The black leather strap feels very comfortable on. My only complaint is the face seems heavy as it keeps moving to the side of my arm. I tried to tighten the strap but then it is too tight for my wrist.I do really like this watch and will be wearing it this fall and winter."
1,"Move on, buy anything else","I have owned this watch for 14 months. Purchased October 2010.The first time, the indiglo feature broke within 2 months. I sent it in for Warranty Repair with an $8 Check for S&H.; (IMHO, charging S&H; for a warranty repair is lame). I got it back, fixed.The indiglo feature broke AGAIN this week. Also I had to replace the band last week as it essentially fell apart, but I wear this watch every day. This is common for a cheapo leather strap so you can't hold that against Timex.I guess if you want a throw away watch and don't care about the Indiglo feature, go ahead, buy.If you want something to last for years like I did, and you really did care about being able to tell time in the dark, move on!UPDATE (6/20/12): This thing is WORTHLESS - I now have to reset the time every week or two as it seems to lose about 3 minutes a week. The thing can't even keep proper time anymore. What a hunk of JUNK!!"
1,poor quality,"The stem broke within 4 weeks. The date can barely be read because it is so small. My last Timex lasted for years which is why I replaced it with another Timex, but the quality has definitely declined."
1,Bad quality!,"The watch they sent me didn't work, and it wasn't a battery problem so I couldn't get it fixed. Big waste of money because I lost the receipt."
5,Nice raincoat,"My grand daughter just loves this, she likes to wear it even when it's not raining. I guess it's the combo of pink & the kitty theme. It is practical in that the hood fits so nicely around the face with a snap under the chin. It's roomy enough that it'll fit over a jacket which is good. I also got her the matching rainboots which are cute but also pratical. I would recommend this."
5,She loves Pink,"I got this for my granddoughter, and she loved it, I thought it was to small, but she didn't want me to send it back, she was afraid that she might not get the same one."
1,Seriously????,"I ordered this thinking it was a children's movie. There was a scene where one of the reindeer was in trouble for using steroids! Along with some other tacky images, the rest kind of bombed."
3,"Funny, but inapporpiate for very young children","Robbie The Reindeer is really a comedy greared for older kids maybe 8 or 10 years old and up. It's not innocent entertainment for very young children like my three year old son. I did not want him to watch it, so it is going to his older cousins. They will get a kick out of it."
3,Enjoyable way to spend time but nothing outstanding,"I certainly enjoyed my time watching Robbie, but I wouldn't go so far as to recommend it to anyone but animation buffs. I listened to it with the British soundtrack (an option you can select on the American disc), and I enjoyed the humor and the storyline, but there was very little that made me laugh out loud or that I thought about even an hour later.The humor was crass at times and definitely not suitable for children. I think the crassness of the humor made it less funny, like they were trading cleverness for crassness and hoping we wouldn't notice the difference.I'd love to see more from the animators, because this was a near miss. A little bit more time spent writing good dialogue or a funny plot would have gone a long way towards making this a five star show.Until then, try Wallace and Gromit or Creature Comforts - both are cleverly hilarious and have truly fantastic claymation."
3,Good for some people,Humor could have been better. Oh well win some lose some. Thought it would be more like Creature comforts.
1,Robbie the Reindeer...,I do NOT like this video. It is not for children but is a vulgar story with animals portrayed as naked humans.
5,Why the US Voice Overs??,This is a fantastic short that I've seen before on TV and thought wow I'll buy the DVD. No real regrets but what a shock and disappointment I got when I noticed a distinct change in voice overs. What they've done is taken away those wonderful characterful voices from the original and dubbed over weak and uninvolving American voices. Who do we think we are changing something this good just because they are not home grown accents. This is arrogant and to be frank all I dislike about this great but often self-centered country of ours.
