2,Boring and boring....,"I like this band alot.. At least I used to. This album is boring, musically and lyrically. Gone are the days of well written songs, this seems more likely to be heard on the radio than the older materials. That's fine if that's what you're into, but I was hoping for more than just simple pop songs. I fell in love with this bands emotion and power, which was displayed with interesting music. The songs on this album are cookie cutter, Bland writing with bland singing. There are a few good songs, but in general this is not worth owning."
2,,"What separates this band from Evanescence (besides geography-these guys are from Slovenia) is mainly the structural song arrangements, the inclusion of a violin, and a few industrial/progressive/gothic parts. Otherwise, you'd swear this is Evanescence's experimental follow-up album. But in the end this is Melodic Hard Rock with many catchy hooks/choruses and songs that could easily be played on the radio. The role of the violin here is just as vital as the role of a guitar, dominating throughout the record and enhancing the music. Without it, this record would probably be extremely unoriginal. Basic, yet energetic female vocals keep the flow of the music listenable. There are some brilliant musical passages like in the song ""Shut Up"" (1:46-2:14), as well as silly male verbal chants (like on ""Blah Blah"" 2:56-3:10), but overall the harmlessness and accessibility of the material is enough to satisfy the open-minded ear."
5,Musical Perfection,"To hear someone describe their music, it just sounds unappealing. But that's where it ends. Their blend of music, with acoustic instruments, and that WONDERFUL violin. It's musical perfection. The lyrics are powerful. And the instruments blend perfectly. It's amazing. Give it a listen! The Mirror, Teen, and Miss You are by far my three favorites."
4,Deceptively effective,"This dvd is simple and low-key, but don't be fooled: you'll get a pretty good workout. I was actually in the middle of the second workout when I realized how sore my legs were getting. I think I might have to skip tomorrow as a result. But this will definitely be part of my rotation. The educational information mixed throughout the workout was a pleasant surprise, with a moment or two where I just couldn't help but giggle. It's a pretty good beginner-to-intermediate workout; and the yoga workout is especially a definite plus for stress relief after a long day."
5,This tape really works for me.,"I'm really out of shape, though was very athletic in my youth (I'm now 57 years old). As a recent birthday gift to myself, I bought 6 fitness videotapes from Amazon, and this was the second I put on. And now that I met it, I'm not even going to bother to try the others until I'm really tired of this one. Kathy Smith is wonderful -- intelligent but not schoolmarmy (as the first tape was)and challenging but not out of reach. Kathy runs you through the beginner level and then proceeds to advanced level, but encourages the beginners to carry on at their level until they're (we're) ready to move on. I don't like getting interrupted every 20 minutes for a health lecture, but I just fast forward to the next segment. I like doing two 20-minute workouts (cardio and weights+bones), which just fits my schedule. I'm writing this to encourage myself to stick with it, but if anyone can keep me conscientious, it's this excellent tape. I strongly recommend it."
1,Works great!!!,"I can't understand why this unit is discontinued and no parts are available. It works great,looks great,and the price is competitive. The cover was slightly cracked when I recieved it as a result of being put in the packing box upside down. I'm going to return it even though it still works. If the cover cracks further or the beater breaks I don't want to wind up with an expensive piece of junk."
4,Nina shines,"I highly recommend this recording, especially for her fans, as one of two last studio recordings. This hip, disco style(sometimes)set with R&B; leanings showcases Nina's ability to tear your insides up with melodic and dramatic skills incomparable in her day. Of special note: ""Saratoga"" ""Touching and Caring"".Ken DelleCave, Miami"
1,returned it - preaches deceit; more fluff than substance,"The author's target audience seems to be salaried employees working unpaid overtime, who are overweight, out of shape, watch too much TV and get too little sleep. His solution to the unpaid overtime is to lie to your employer and coworkers about how much you work at home, use oversized containers to take work home so it looks like more, schedule outside appointments late in the dy so you can just go home, etc. A lot of the book is aimed at helping people take better care of themselves and get their priorities in order, which I applaud. But that isn't what I was looking for in a time management book. I was looking for practical strategies for organizing my work and time, which it is thin on. It has some, and there are some very good ideas in there, but not really much more than a good magazine article."
2,"Excellent, but why not get a collection?","Though not one of John Keats' very best poems, Lamia is a major work and essential for anyone interested in him. It has his signature unparalleled beauty but is also unusually thoughtful, with intriguing musings on illusion vs. reality and the nature of love, beauty, and art. Keats' lament about empiricism destroying natural wonder has heavily influenced everyone from Edgar Allen Poe to Richard Dawkins, and Lamia remains central to the art/nature vs. science debate. The story is also interesting in itself; Keats brings a fantasy world vividly to life, draws us in emotionally, and even has a devastating ending. Finally, the poem is impressive technically, showing Keats' growing couplet mastery. One should certainly read his best-known works first, but this should be an early stop; that said, the fact that it is virtually every Keats collection makes a standalone very hard to justify. The important thing at any rate is to read it in some form."
5,Best version yet.,"It is true that you miss some of the more humorous moments and side character development scenes, but the sound and visual quality can't be beat and you can get through the main story line much faster this way (around 100 episodes total) compared to the original version (291 episodes)."
5,"To europeans customers, that its allsome!!","I dont know if every FUNIMATION Bluray have A/B Region but that is the coolest thing that FUNIMATION have ever make, because in Spain we dont have this anime series relesed on dvd or Bluray (we have dubbed for TV, but not more).Thanks for everything!"
5,WE'RE IN LOVE NOW!,"Kai is simply amazing. It's a revered and respectful follow-up that the original DragonBall deserved. The audio and animation are spot on in here. No edits that I can detect. The only downside that I can think of is that there isn't an option to view the episodes in a Marathon mode or watch them with the TV Version opening instead of the DVD exclusive opening. Sorry, but I prefer the TV version over this one. But please, don't stop-don't stop WE'RE IN LOVE NOW!"
3,Rhythm of Resistance-Black South African Music,"I think there should have been more in the video about South African music and the rhythms of resistance as there are so many numerous examples such as what South Africans call 'Toy Toy'. From 1976 the students of South Africa came up with a lot of rhythmic music expressing resistance to the Apartheid regime and to my opinion those are the real rhythms of resistance. However this video is good for those people who would like to know how was the music past of the black people of South Africa e.g. the music of the migrant workers and other local musician during the hard times in South Africa. Otherwise, for me I expected more because I know the music history of South Africa."
5,"Critics, Schmitics....The movie is good","As one who never pays attention to what the critics have to say about the movies (I mean they're critics, come on, all they do is criticize). If everyone listened to them, the movie industry would be non-existent. I mean hey, Ebert co-wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls..........need I say more, but, back to the subject at hand. The Mummy Returns is a great popcorn movie. Enjoy it for the great ride and then make up your own mind if it was worth the purchase. Personally, I think you'll be glad to add this to your collection."
5,The Mummy Returns.,"Great Movie Cast and Crew were great! Especially Brendan Frasier good guy I met him once. I heard the news a Mummy 3 is in the mix. No not The Scorpion King (April 2002),but a 3 Mummy sequel to Mummy Returns. Brendan Fraser will be in it. Any other cast I don't know I at least look forward to a 2003 Mummy 3. ..."
4,A high point of adventure in a dismal summer movie season,"Granted that this sequel lags behind the first installment of the series, it is by far superior to anything that followed this summer. In a season of mega CGI ""blockbusters"", here was one with likable and interesting stars and a pace and level of excitement that was breathtaking. Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz come close to being the new ""Indiana and Marion"", indeed it would have been a fantastic casting coup to cast him as Indiana Jones III in the final Harrison Ford flix supposed to be in planning. Imagine Ford, Connery and Fraser as the Jones Boys! The two Mummys make a nice matched set and a good way to spend a rainy afternoon or a late nite with friends."
2,A sequel should always be judged as a sequel.,"Meaning that it of course will be not as fresh and original as the first film. That being said, this movie still wasn't very good. While the first film was predictable and formulaic, it also was genuinely funny and had good character development, the second is just formulaic and predictable. The DVD does have some redeeming features- it is exhaustive in special features. So much so, that if you are interested in learning how all the special effects are produced, then this might be a good disc for you. Overall the movie is eye-candy that insults your intelligence, but is (partly) saved by great DVD presentation."
4,no plot but it works?,unbelievably this movie proves that sometimes a sequal to a stellar movie is to throw at us mondo mayhem and plenty special effects more than any other movie in history. This was a good overrall movie. No scene stood out in particular but it was nicely touched. Computer generated effects have come along way and the THE MUMMY RETURNS best shows that. The plot is almost tossed out the window just so we can see Vosloo and co. make full use of hollywood special effects to the maximum. I think it works perfectly though. This is a must own film especially for those like me who dig special effects.
4,Great Sequel,"This movie was even better that the first. There was more action and special effects. The Rock was terrific! I liked the main characters better in this one, although they didn't waste a lot of time on conversation and character developement. This is an action movie from beginning to end. This is not Academy Award material, just a great movie for its type."
3,The Mummy Returns Pulling All Stops,"This flick is pure popcorn. It is superior to the first one. It has everything you could want in mindless summer fare. An easy plot to follow, cool leading characters, great special effects, and did I mention a Crouching Tiger like chick fight mid-way through the film.My only problem with the film was it kind of ripped off other films. The pygmie scene was a direct rip of ""Jurassic Park"" minus the Velociraptors. And the marketing of the film bamboozled all of us into thinking The Rock was a major character when he only says one line in the movie ""Haku Macente"" he yells and we wonder why is he on the poster?If you want to escape from your demanding job, nagging wife, or obnoxious kids watch this movie. Take it for what it is pure escapism."
5,This is a Pretty Good Movie,Mummy returns is a pretty good movie but there are a few things Iwould change. Number one I didn't care for the way that they made Seti the First into a total bastard. Number 2 the ending was a little depressing. I think Imhotep and Ancksunamun should been able to have a happy ever after too. Also they should have made sure thatthe Princess was called by the same name through out the movie.On the up side using the ancient language of KMT (Ancient Egypt) was a wonderful touch. I also enjoyed the Ancient Egypt scenes. They did a good job bringing Ancient Egypt to life again.On a scale one to 10 I would rate this movie a eight and half.
1,I wan't my money back!,There's not much I can say about this movie other than after about 30 minutes it was so painful to watch I had to get up and leave. The senseless action is just unbelievably overdone and predictable. I would rate this movie at zero stars.
5,Better than the first,The special effects were better than the first. There were far more action scenes. The storyline was more in depth. The Scorpion King was a great villain. This was just a better all around movie than the first.
3,A good secuel,A good secuel with good special effects and the extended presence of Patricia Velasquez.Recommened to your friends.
2,At least you have more than a ticket stub...,"I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater. While the special effects are excellent, the storyline and acting is bland and predictable. The DVD gives you some extras such as behind the scenes segments. Save your money and just rent this DVD if you must see it."
2,Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable,"i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT."
3,The Special Effects Return,"Special effects often dominate this movie, including the unneeded narrative at the beginning, where the CGI's look cartoon-like and silly. We could have received that back story within the dialogue later. The action scenes and some of the bantering work much better than when the movie's makers try to prove how many CGI's they can crowd into one frame. I would prefer to see more of the actual actors, but I still enjoyed this nonstop adventure."
5,what a toptastic movie,"For all of you people who have not seen this movie then shame on you.This is possibly the best movie of the last 10 years (yes i know i have just angered all you star wars fans but please let me finish).The original left you thinking that there would be a sequel and they did'nt dissapoint us with this.The cast were very good because they never changed any of the original characters and it went along on a variable joyride of thrills and spills.This movie has something for everyone and is no doubt the platform for bigger things for world wrestling federation star The Rock who was only in there a short while and was very good at hamming up his role as the scorpion king.All in all a great film with laughs,scares.thrills and spills a definate classic.Ronnie Birmingham England."
2,Special Effects overdone,I liked the first movie. This one went way overboard on the special effects to the extent that it actually looks unrealistic. The mummy does not look in any way real in this movie. I was very dissapointed with the movie and the only reason I would even watch it again is to see the fight scene between the two women again.
1,Bonus Features Review,"This movie stinks. Action movies with kids in the story are lame, this one is no exception. I like the Mummy Movies because I like Egypt and the history, but the winks at the camera and the kid are so dated -- it really makes a bomb out of this. Attempts to incorporate every action movie staple really wear thin -- like the pigmy mummies clearly using the Lord of the Rings troll figure -- whatever his name is -- didn't see it -- never will.But there is some true humor here listening to the director commentary and how clueless he is to just how horid this film is. He even ridicules Roger Ebert who had legitimate complaints that these knuckleheads dismiss out of hand -- like they never considered, or finally realized, the movie wasn't good.Some positives: Rachael Weisz is great -- and so is all of the cast -- wasted by bad period directing. ILM effects are great and fun to watch. Some of the extra features are difficult to view, with no ""play all"" option."
3,A Good Following Up...,"This is not the first movie. All the feeling of the first movie can't be recreated. Though Stephen Sommers and his returning players try. But this is still pretty fun. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Oded Fehr, Arnold Vosloo, and John Hannah return for the sequel, which is a plus given the state of sequels theses days. Although they can't recreate the magic of the first they give it a really good try.The second movie also features the on screen debut of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and it's a good debut.The DVD features more of the same from the first movie, it has a commentary, making of features, and other special features, including an interview with The Rock.Recommended."
3,"Just as much fun as the first,","even if it is somewhat more lacking in plot development or common sense. By all logic, after the first. there was no way the Mummy should've been able to return, but hey; it's Hollywood.Again, this is one long rollercoaster ride, with a tip of the tanna leaf to Indiana Jones. Special effects are, again, engaging as hell, Evie somehow managed to get much sexier, Alex lends a nice touch, O'Connel and Im-ho-tep retain the same touches from 1, and there's never a problem with more of Patricia, even if she really can't act. The new crop of villians worked, too, for what they were. Definitely woprth seeing, and some great extras. The way-too-short outtake reel and the constant harping on Scorpion King promos however, are cumbersome."
3,Decent,"Well as has been mentioned many times already, if you're looking for an award-winning story/cast or anything, look elsewhere. This movie is pure fun. I agree with that, the effects in this moive are great, and there's enough to keep you laughing and engaged on a dreary Seattle weekend. But there are a few issues that I have with this DVD. Why isn't it widescreen? Especially if this meant to be a Collector's edition. I was a little disappointed by that. The other thing that bothered me in this movie is that started off a little lame, and also very dark. It could've just been my laptop, but for the first 20 minutes, everything was so dark it was hard to see what was going on. Bu then again it could've just been my laptop. A decent movie, and good fun, in spite of those issues."
2,A pretty boring ride.,"Don't bother with this lousy sequel, because unless you're five years old the poorly written characters, dialogue and The Rock just don't impress. CGI's alone can't make a good movie and unfortunately that's all that seems to sell in Hollywood anymore. Also check out the awful CGI of the Rock towards the end of the movie, does it get any more fake?"
2,The Monster Walks,"The Mummy (1999) was perhaps the greatest achievement in the Adventure-genre since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), while the sequel suffers quite a lot from the fact, that it was obviously rushed for commercial reasons. It's a great rough draft though and a few sequences are quite brilliant, including the fighting off the warrior-mummies in the London-doubledecker-bus turned singledecker. It's great fun, but nothing at all like the first one."
3,Not as good as the original,I think it was a worthy sequel bt i thought that it was gonna have better acting lke the 1st. The scenes were pretty sorry and the Rocks acting made me vomit firguitivly speaking.
3,Not to bad,"Mummy Returns was not to bad, but like most ""part two's"" the first was better. Special effects were just as good as the frist, but the acting was just cheesey to say the least."
3,"Lot's of Action, Lack of Storyline","The first movie was spectacular. It had it all; horror, romance, comedy, action, not to mention a great story!! The Mummy Returns gets credit for having some fantastic special effects, and lots of action. However, the storyline was rather simple. It went from one action scene right to another. There were still some attempts at comedy and romance, but it just wasn't pulled off as well as it was in the original. One great thing about this movie, was that it had pretty much all the same actors from part 1. That is something that is rare in sequels, so it was nice to see that happen. Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie, buy by no means was it a great movie."
3,"Not as good, but still fun","This movie has more of everything that made the first one popular. More bullets! More CGI! More implausible situations! More wisecracks! More scantily-clad females!Unfortunately, I was actually less impressed with this one than the first one. The characters are still charming (especially the couple of Fraser and Weisz), and the villains are still wonderfully evil, but it seems that the special effects rule the day here. Even the Scorpion King's big scene at the end is performed entirely by a computer-generated character (it makes one wonder how much the Rock was paid for this non-appearance).However, fans of the first one should still enjoy themselves during this highly entertaining film."
1,wrong product,"I ordered this for an October birthday. imagine my surprise when we opened the product for viewing and found not ""The Mummy Returns,"" but ""The Mummy"" (which I had also purchased)."
3,Not a Necessary Sequel,"This movie is inferior to the first entry in the series. I know it's not like that was a really serious film that should have had a complicated story continuation, but it didn't deserve to be retreaded and contradicted. It's like the filmmakers sort of went ""If people liked that, we'll just do more of the same thing,"" and didn't bother to remember what elements stuck out as good in The Mummy.On the plus side, the visual effects in this movie are even better. While there are some too-silly moments and unnecessary comic relief characters (annoying little kid and the balloon pilot), there are also really kickass action highs and development of the stars from the first movie. If you liked The Mummy at all then you should see this at least once, but unlike that movie I wouldn't call it a must-own for the action-adventure fan."
5,The Mummy Returns and beats the first,"Loved this movie. Usually sequels are not as good as the first show, but this is an exception. I enjoyed it as much, if not more than The Mummy. You learn more about the characters' history in this show and their characters are fleshed out. The story itself is as good as the first, with new evils and characters to keep you on the edge of your seat at times, and the mix of suspense and humor is there. There are no dull spots it the movie. It keeps your attention from beginning to end. The bad guys are marvelously wicked. It's worth the price, you will watch it more than once and each time you watch it you'll notice something you missed the last time you watched it."
1,CAUTION! Unplayable format,HD DVDs are an obsolete technology that WILL NOT play in a Blu-Ray player. Some companies will send you an upgrade to the Blu-Ray version for a fee ($4.95 + $6.95 S&H). DO NOT BUY THIS FORMAT!
1,Mummy Dearest,"Such trash the movie studios insult us with. The Cringometer peaked over the red line from the opener and climaxed with some of the worst CG ever. The Rock- more like The Crock! Possibly the worst film in any aspect ratio, preferable on NO SCREEN. Had hoped that Stephen Sommers would be sent into exile for this sub-par Jules Verne abortion, but we've just seen Van Helsing and don't understand why he hasn't suicided."
1,No Return,"I received this product in a very timely fashion, however I did not realize that it was only for an HD DVD player, (error on my part). Once I realized I had made this mistake, I contacted the company to exchange for regular DVD or Blue-ray. They told me that they only have HD-DVD's and would not refund. Lesson learned I guess.Not very timely in their response either way nor good customer service.I would not recommend."
2,What a disappointment...,"The 1999 version of THE MUMMY was spectacular. So when this movie came out, I had high hopes for it. But this was a waste of my time! The film makers did a rather stupid thing of bringing ALL of the characters back for this movie. That was a BIG mistake! They also tried to make this one a little more funny. It just didnt't work out. But despite all the bad things I've said about it, there are some good things. Great suspense and most of the action was cool. But the ending fight scene with Brendan Fraser and The Rock went on forever. Rent this one first."
1,"1 star for the edition, 3 for the movie","Not a very great sequel (like most), but come on, enough already with the double dipping. Granted, we all KNEW this would come out as soon as they announced the third film (I don't count any film starring a has been wrestler as a sequel, sorry, that's just how I roll). Seems we get two new featurettes, and again, as SOON as the third film comes out on DVD, there'll be ANOTHER re-release. Wait for that one, I'm sure it will be ""fantastic."""
5,Are you kidding? This movie was great!,"I loved this film - the action, the effects, the cast and crew - everything was marvelous! And the pace was perfect - exactly what you expect from an action film. It was fast and furious, but it made me want to come back for more! And I guarantee you, I won't be the only one lined up in October to buy this DVD. It's a real treat!"
3,"much of the same, yet more shallow","i thought i was going to like this film, i was excited about seeing it, but while watching it, i always wondered, why is everybody fighting? some of the fighting just didn't seem to be needed in the story. and also i wasn't that impressed with the weird monsters attacking at the beginning and end of the film in the desert, as far as computer graphics were concerned. also the scorpion king graphics looked more like a computer game than something real and hideous and frightening. sorry, i thought it would be better than what it was."
4,It came close.,"""The Mummy Returns"" came in close behind the original ""Mummy"" movie. Sure the little pigme people running around where hard to buy but it was the special effects that had me captured. At the end of the movie is the ""Rocks"" staring role, but there is a shock to see the ""Rock"" at the end. Will I tell you what the shock is? No go out and rent it if you want to find out. The DVD version is awsome. It has behind the scenes features, cast outtakes and even a feature of a new attraction at Universal Studios in Hollywood, CA. However if you want the full ""Mummy"" experience be sure to catch the first. The Munny Returns filled the vacant shoes of a good action packed film with a puch or two."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Short and sweet....it's a fast-paced adventure with plenty of somewhat cool effects but it doesn't come close to ""The Mummy""."
5,My Mummy Review,"I thought that this was a great movie because it had a lot of action and i just really really liked it.(Brendan Fraser is hot and my mom thinks that Arnold Vosloo is handsom.) When it first came out in theaters i wanted to see it but i didnt see the first one so me and my friend rented it and really liked it so maybe a week later i went and saw it thought it was awesome and at the theaters i saw it nine times. I bought the first one and i watch it over and over again. I cant wait untill October second, my dad even said that he would watch the Mummy and right after that the Mummy Returns. The thing thats bad though is its on a Tuesday so I'll probably have homework, and then four hours of movies. So for everyone that hasn't seen this movie I think you should its a very good movie and the kids would like it too, but there is violence and swearing depends how young they are the might be scared. So i say go and see it. They are my two favorite movies."
3,"The Mummy Returns... for the last time, hopefully.","I dont think ive ever seen a movie with this much mindless action. But, GOOD mindless action. im not saying the action parts bad, but it can give you a migraine that could kill a possum. Again. Anyway, the simple fact is that while the action is near flawless, there are so many great opportunities to build upon it and create a story that could simply make itself another Citizen Kane, it simplifies it to the point of absolute mindlessness. Which isn't a bad thing..."
2,I must have missed something,"As someone who enjoy Saturday matinee type movies, I thought the Mummy Returns would be great, but it was so-so. When was the last time you saw someone die of a stab wound to the abdomen, and show NOT ONE TRACE OF BLOOD!!?? The part of the son had the same effect as in Temple of Doom-- nearly ruined the film for adults. I'd wait for it on TV in a few months."
3,Would be better without Brendan,"Great idea for a story, it is also well told. Neat special effects really add to its fun factor. Only two complaints that are big enough to keep it out of my DVD collection. #1, There is a very cheesy fight seen with ""The Rock""'s head morphed onto the body a giant scorpion; can anybody say ""Clash of the Titans""? #2 While I think Brendan Fraser does a great job with comedies like ""Airheads"" & ""Blast from the Past"", he is no Harrison Ford and makes for way-to-young and kind of wimpy Indiana Jones."
3,"Action, adventure, laughs and special effects galore","What can I say? Great story, interesting characters, mysterious Egyptian myths and legends combine in this picture. The story is an old one, and the film relies heavily on computer generated images. As a sequel, the story grows a bit thin in places, but it's all about adventure and fun rather than great acting depth. The DVD is loaded with extras and is a worthy addition to your collection."
5,Enter The Scorpion King,The Mummy Returns is an awesome movie. and it brings the start to The Scorpion King. this is an awesome Movie. I Recommend This Movie For Everyone. If you liked this movie check out the other two Mummy MoviesThe MummyThe Mummy 3: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor
4,Good details and camera views but....,"I personally like the mummy 2. I am a fan of brenden frasier.....and i just love wrestling more than anything....mix them together...you get great entertainment. Both men are gifted actors.....and cute ones at that..but the only thing i did not care for in the movie was when the Rock.... aka. Dwayne Johnson...was formed into the scopion king (the actual scorpion thing....it was so fake looking..i personally thought that ruined some of the movie..the shots were great and the views and the story line were too...... but then u get to the ""scorpion Rock"" and it just looks like it was not for the movie. but other than that i thought it was a great movie and i advise people to seeit."
4,Folks it is only a movie,"These reviews are more heated than a political debate.This sequel is not as good as the original, but still good entertainment, which is what it is suppose to be. It has action,romance and good special effects. Also has an excellent cast. I bought it, and I think it is worth the $20.00 I paid for it. How can you not LOVE MUMMIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A fun but dumb Mummy,"The Mummy Returns was a box office hit but I guess that's because there's alot of Rock fans out there. Meanwhile his appearence in this film is no bigdeal, he just utters some words in another language on the beginning and isjust a CGI giant scorpion creature at the end. It's hardly a big deal. Ontop of that Brendon Fraser and Racheal Weiz smooch way too much in this one,I felt like yelling ""get the hook"". The movie can also be slow and lame attimes and it's not even as fun as the first one.It's mostly just the firstone all over again too, plus the mummy himself just comes off as an idiotthis time around. However I can't say it isn't fun at times though and thatthe visuals aren't cool. I'm giving it a very mild recommendation becausekids from 6 to 20 should like it."
3,Better Than The First!!,"I saw this movie 4 time because of one thing, THE FIGHT SEENS!!! The sword fight seens are ok but The sai fight seens are unbleviable. I have learned Martial Arts for 7 years and the the actresses looked as good as me. See this movie of you like Martial Arts."
1,bad,"this is one of the worst movies ever made. I have no clue why it was so popular. First of all, the story is so stupid! Scorpion King? Give me a break! And the special effects look terrible. Woody Woodpecker looks more realistic. If you see this movie, be prepared to see humans interacting with cartoons most of the time. So I guess this movie is just like 'Space Jam.'"
1,Plays like it was adapted from a video game.,"If you like non-stop action, care nothing for story or character, and enjoy watching digitized monsters die in a variety of ways, this is the film for you. Otherwise skip it.Brendan Frazier's son has been kidnapped by a powerful, ancient being. In order to save the boy, Frazier must take on countless hoardes of bad guys in a variety of locations. He mowes through them like a superhero from a video game, and despite the non-stop action I found this film almost as dull as watching someone else play Quake for two hours."
2,the little movie that tried too hard,"Or another review title could be ""how subplots took over the movie. The best review I can give is my 12 year old son who sums up the movie as ""kind of dumb"". So in a nutshell, the effects are great, the plot is stupid and the main charaters do not have the same personalities as in the first movie. Best example is Evie who doesn't even look like the same person anymore. On a last note, if you are going to pay someone 3million dollars to apear in a film (The Rock) shouldn't he at least get a line to speak?"
2,"What is this, a video game?","I have to say that I was grievouly disappointed with the Mummy Returns. For one thing, the special effects were way over done. It made the movie look more like a video game at times, instead of a movie.The new storyline of Evie being reincarnated from the past as an ancient Pharohs daughter was also too much. I know we're talking about Hollywood, but come on! Evie was like a whole new character. She even learned how to fight all the sudden, which she could'nt do in the first movie.There's also the ripoff scene from Jurrasic Park 2 where guys get jumped in the tall grass by raptors. In TMR they use short natives instead.I'm going to avoid buying this movie when it comes out. If I buy a Mummuy Returns Video game, it will probally look the same as the movie, but at least I could play it."
1,AWFUL MOVIE,"I saw this pathetic movie when it first came out last May and was completely disappointed with it. It's got to be the worst film I've seen this year. The acting is completely lousy as is the script. There is no story at all, the movie is just a bunch of guys running around killing mummies. It's ten times worse than the abysmal first - give THE MUMMY RETURNS a skip."
1,pretty bad,"If you loved the first one, this one might be worth a rent from the video store, but i thought that they were both pretty bad."
2,Mummy Returns Poor Quality Transfer,"While The Mummy Returns is a good movie overall, the DVD Transfer is not that great, especially the soundtrack. The Dolby Digital 5.1 is to loud in most parts of the movie, but on my copy, it seems that when the real action scenes come, the audio reduces itself, and sounds as if it converts to 2-channel sound. Very annoying. Maybe the ghost of the Mummy is playing around with my volume control!"
4,Take my advice - RENT it first...,"I DID like this movie. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first. There were definitely a few ""stretches"" in this one. However, the special effects were really good, as was the overall story and acting. I don't want to give anything away. I DO remember saying ""oh give me a break"" a couple of times, but for the most part, I really DO like this and don't regret buying it. I DO wish I had rented it first though."
4,A good fantasy action-adventure!,"I saw this on the big screen, and I loved it! The fantasy elements are great and there's so much sword fights and gunplay it'll knock you silly! However, this does get cheesy at times and the computer-generated effects do tend to get really fake (especially the Scorpion King scene at the end, which looks like something out of ""Ants""). The first one is definetly more realistic and is way better as a horror movie, but this wins over as a fantasy action-adventure. I like them both the same, maybe the first one a teeny-weenie, itsy-bitsy bit more, but I still love this movie."
1,The worst I've seen in a long time!,"Never-ending boring unoriginal special effects, that would have obscured the story if there had been one, larded with (not spiced with!) mysticistic egyptianesque mumbo jumbo and mushy sentimentality. The only vaguely interesting scenes are the fights between the bad lady and the good lady. I am glad that I viewed this film as a recording - this allowed me to scrole past (fast view) the uninteresting parts - about two thirds! All this is not the fault of the actors! Its too bad because I liked the first one."
1,"Mummy, I Want To Go Home","The Mummy Returns is the worst kind of CGI explosion. Visual noise splashed across the screen without rhyme or reason. An action = entertainment mish mash of woefully inadequate characters, couldn't care less, just plain stupid plotting and special effects turned up to a brash, artless, over-reaching 11.Brendan Fraser struggles valiantly against this background of technical hysteria to give something approximating a likable performance with absolutely no help from the so-called script. And the only suspence in this 'worst of its genre' action horror flick was not knowing whether it would ever end."
1,This should have been a good movie...,"but it really wasn't. The returning characters display none of the character traits that made them entertaining in the first movie. The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the ""Mortal Kombat"" type video games of the 90's. If the producers had spent half of what went toward special effects on a better script, this movie could have lived up to its predecessor."
1,The Mummy that Wasn't,First of all I was really disappointed in this movie. The first Mummy movie was Excellent. This second movie had no storyline whatsoever. In the first movie The Mummy becomes mortal and Mr. O'C.onnell kills him. Well in the second movie when they dig him up out of the ground and he becomes alive again. How did he get his powers back?I'm not criticizing the acting. I feel that the cast did what they could with a less than adequate script. I feel with a better written script that the Mummy Returns could have been just as good as the first movie.
2,"Decent Features, BAD Movie","I liked the features of this DVD, but that is the only thing I did like. The acting was sub-par, the writing was cliched, and the story was predictable. Mr. Sommers and gang try and disguise this with plenty of action sequences and lackluster special effects. I would like to think most people are to smart to fall for this ploy.If not for the features, I would have given this disk one star."
5,Finally the Mummy has come back to Video.,"Awesome movie, but was I the only one who wanted that little kid to die? Really it was all his fault, the Kid should of had his head cut off by the Scorpion Kings Pincers or one of the Anubis Army Guys, and What's with Imenhotep? In Love, get the hell outta here, I wanted to see him lay a little smack on the Rock but that never happened, they made the Mummy in the Wussy, but the movie still rocked. BUY THIS MOVIE, it's worth the money, and it's alot better than ""Ernest goes to School""."
1,did not save best for last,The movie is really sorry.It just doesn't make sense. Plot doesn't flow. It is like it hade been wrote by third graders. However the special effects are good. Rent it first and you will not buy it
3,Lukewarm,"I have mixed feelings about this movie, I suppose, like many people do. The plot is large-scale, there are now two bad guys to defeat, and the main character is funny and engaging.For me personally, I would rather see an action movie with more depth of emotion, less obvious special effects, and a less predictable plot. Essentially, not a comic book movie. I would count myself in the minority of Americans, however. Movies such as Three Kings, Memento, and Gladiator are more up my alley.If you enjoy huge armies going into battle, lots of special effects, and The Rock, check this one out. You'll dig it."
1,If only Hollywood...,"Could stop making horrible movies such as this, then there'd be a chance for something good to come out more than usual. I can't begin to say how bad it was. The SFX weren't nearly as good as the first, the acting was worse (though I didn't think that'd be possible), and the worst part about the movie was The Rock's head superimposed on a scorpion's body! Ye gods, that was pathetic. I was going into the movie expecting a massive 3-man brawl b/w the Mummy, Fraser, and The Rock. That would've made the movie more enjoyable, but alas, Hollywood couldn't be that interesting. So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick, look elsewhere. Go buy ""Predator"" and see what Hollywood used to put out as an action flick. Don't waste your money on this trash."
3,I Guess You Can Call Them Extras,"Most of the special features on here are either boring, and I normally love the extras, or they are about the upcoming Scorpion King movie. It's mainly promotional stuff and worthless unless you are interested in the upcoming movie. Universal better fix all this if and when they release this movie as an Ulitmate Edition like they did with the first film."
5,"Not An Oscar Winner, but a Great Action Movie","If you are expecting great serious action then this movie isn't for you, but if you are like me an enjoy action movies this is one of them. While a typical script this movie offers non-stop action, it kind of reminds me of the Indiana Jones series. It kind of brings back the kid in me. A terrific film, I personally would recommend it."
4,"The Movie was good, but universal will dupe us again.","Today low and behold the mummy returns dvd is brought ot my attention and see that its being called a collectors edition. Now if i remember the original mumy had the collectors edition, the widescreen version and the ultimate edition. I am personaly sick of large movie house companies going out of their way to screw us out of hard earned dollars because we end up buying a bare bones edition of a dvd, while they take thier sweet time getting thier Ultimate editions ready. The movie is good but will the dvd be really worth it the first time out? Something tells me I should'nt hold my breath."
2,Both movies look more like theme park rides,Both movies look more like Universal promo adds for the next theme park rides. At least Rachel Weiz only made two of these movies and then decited to try more substance type roles. None of the other cast members did.
4,The Mummy Returns,I enjoyed the movie very much although some of the computer bad guys were a bit over the top. The fact that Oded Fehr (Ardeth Bay)has more scenes helped alot. This film is entertaining and also answers many questions left over from the 1st film.
4,All right Brandon Frazier!,"It is true that the first movie of series edges this one. But,this tale delivers great run of events introducing small bit as the lore of the Scorpion King. I think Brandon Frazier is turning out to be the next Indiana Jones. He and his his wife pull off a wonderful marital combo. Can't wait to see next flick in series. The young son was interesting. Yet, if there is a third, I hope the movie writers age his son to sixteen or send him off to boarding school. Good movie, great sci-fi effects, truereflection of original loveable characters."
2,Forgot to mention this...,"But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.By the way, this movie on the whole. Was not very good and was a bit way too campy."
5,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,This is way better then the first! It is so awesome Brendan Fraser did even better in this one than he did in the first. It is fun action packed amazing adventure movie! THis is one of the best movies Ive ever seen!
3,The Mummy of All Movies!,"This sequel is more sure of itself than its predecessor, which suffered from lack of target audience. In this regard The Mummy Returns is more refined. However, it is a throwback to the classic days of Special Effects extravaganza where the visual element overrides all plot and character elements. What this achieves is a rolicking movie without much to relate with the main characters.Comedy plays a less significant role in this sequel, compared to the first movie, which gives it a more serious edge. This balance of drama versus comedy makes the sequel more comparable to the Indiana Jones trilogy than the first movie, but still falls a long way short of the quality of the Spielberg/Lucas venture.It is a typical ""leave-your-brain-at-the-door"" movie, which, when all things are considered, IS entertaining. On the whole I feel this is a more rewarding movie than the first."
3,Even more adventure than the first,"This flick had some very nice elaborate settings, and was filled with a mixture of great CGI and poor CGI, but once you get passed that, it really is a fun pop-corn popper. Which is what the summer movie season is all about. You want art buy a Picaso, you want story, buy a King, you want a movie buy a Spielberg."
3,Corny but pretty,"The dorky ""one liners"" and ""humorous"" smartass remarks are irritating enough but add a kid to it and it really gets annoying. The plot was corny too but I enjoyed the surrealistic adventures anyway. Reminds me a tad of Jurassic.Some of the animation did look a little fake in the movements, which didnt look natural. Still the movie is a total eye feast. If you have an HDTV it is incredible!! I'm not sure I would buy this again but it really shows off the capabilities of my HDTV. The picture is razor sharp, great colors and effects except as noted above. I do dislike the 2:35 aspect ratio the studios keep putting out. I didnt buy a big TV so they could go and give me a tiny little strip to watch."
3,Bad Effects and more,I expected to see great special effects based on everything I had heard but in fact they were awful. I mean as in fake computer-generated looking...so much as to be distracting. They looked like a video game or something you would see on some low budget tv show. And there was no character development...this might not be that bad except it resulted in me having no care about the characters to the point where I was cheering when they got killed or were about to get killed. overvall it was entertaining but nothing here is award winning.
2,fair to middlin',"I actually liked the first Mummy film....I thought that even tho, yes it was cheesy, it had good special effects, and a decent plot. But the sequel left something to be desired.For some reason I thought the special effects were....worse in this movie. Not sure if the same studio created the effects for both films, but this one looked worse (to me). The Scorpion King (with the Rock's face) looks completely unbelievable.Also, the relationship the two ""parents"" had with the son was laughable (not in a good way). They didn't even act like they loved him, and he was pretty much in danger the whole last half of the movie. Just shoddy acting.If you want to watch a good mummy movie, do yourself a favor and rent the first one."
4,Great entertainment!,"Seems like a lot of people were down on this film, but I found it enjoyable, kind of a lite fare. Makes me think of watching movies on Saturday afternoon as a kid. This is not a definitive work of art, what it is, is entertainment, that's it. No deep meaning, messages, points, just a quickly moving story and some actors that are generally appealing."
5,Loved the first and this one!!,"I like The Mummy and I really loved The Mummy Returns. These reviews that talk about no character development, story development, blah blah blah, the movie is suppose to be entertaining and it delivers that hands down. All of the original cast returned and you could see the chemistry between them which was great. Brendan and Rachel were great so was Jonathan and bringing back Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay for the sequel and giving him a bigger role was pure genius. He is fabulous, incredible not to mention gorgeous. And Brendan Fraser is as adorable as ever. The movie kept me hooked from start to finish and was pure fun."
4,One of the best action/adventure films.,"This is much better that the original. All the original characters with some great additions return for even bigger adventure. Better legend, better story, and even better visual effects. Even The Rock could not spoil it.Definitely worth seeing."
3,"TOO FAKE, TOO LONG","It's an O.K. movie, but the effects look so fake! I've seen 20 year old movies with better animation than that seen on the Scorpion King scenes! It just goes on and on and makes you wonder when it's going to end."
3,Fun and sand,"It was fun. a lot of SFX and more sands... however, that's it. It's Hollywood typical ""everything-go-well"" american movie! You cannot stop laughing during the film.But you might want to say after watching this movie, ""So what?"""
2,when will Hollywood learn.....,"No plot, no credible facts. King Scorpion and Imhotep didn't even live in the same time frame. When will Hollywood learn?!This is a pathetic sequel to the first film, The Mummy (which was much more fun). It is also a film which make several references to older films in some scenes oh! so cliché (the jet airship?!?). The scriptwriters obviously did not care about making any sense when writing this junk. Alex's mother would worry but not the father?!?!?! Oh pleeease. The kid seems to have been, at first, a copy of Ramses Peabody (see the Amelia Peabody series written by Elizabeth Peters); however this dissolves after his meeting with the mummy.A film as full of oh! so phony special effects as possible. Some scenes even look like video games. It is so incredibly gory too.The two stars I give for making me laugh from beginning to end, and for its unbelievable stupidity throughout the story."
1,UGGGH! Save your money!,This is THE WORST movie sequel I have ever seen. It was so terrible that it inspired me to write my first movie review ever on Amazon. Where's my receipt? You might enjoy this flick if you're less than 10 years old AND in possession of a single digit IQ. It's a huge disappointment following the original Mummy flick. I would like to give it a negative star.
2,the mummy returns,"I find it very hard to believe that some people enjoyed this movie so much that they gave it a five star rating. If this gets five stars, what do good films get?!. This makes no sense. The film is poor. Hre are a few thoughts...Acting: I've seen better acting in fifth grade musicals.Plot: Plot, what plot?Dialog: Laughable.Character Development: The characters are so static that I felt like I was watching a soap opera set in 1930s Egypt in which many things arbitrarily exploded.I will praise this film in one way: it is better than Hollow Man (but then again, sitting in an empty parking lot watching a dumpster for 90 minutes is more satisfying than watching Hollow Man). In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again."
2,ryan hickneys mummy review,this moview could of been much better. it was as dumb as dumb can get. the only good thing about it is that the actors played good. i am sure the director was feeling low when he found the rating in the theaters. BYE
2,2 stars for the special effects -2 stars for the kid,I hate that kid. I hate his horrible acting.yes the second film had so much promise but it was ruined by a small kid whose only job was making foolish faces. yes this is a fantsy film and in fantasy films you can find mummies but you can not find rocket boosted zeplins with so small a ballon that can only lift a small cat. and in the end who had killed herself for imhotep run away being afraid to die??? why had her killed herself in the first place? She was the firavun's wife. Well if they will do a third of this movie hope that they will left that kid at home.
2,So the mummy returns?...did we need him to?,"I enjoyed THE MUMMY, but before going to see this one I somehow knew it wasn't going to be good. Well, I was right. If you are looking for a movie that will showcase the latest in CGI technology, by all means see it. Just don't look for interesting characters or a good story. The first movie was good. It was one of those movies that in the future if it's on during a lazy Sunday, you will watch it. It had that quality about it. The sequel left me wishing for it be over as I sat in the theater.The story becomes borderline ridiculous and the acting, well, they knew their lines at least. It follows a formula. For example, in the first one we had the crazy biplane pilot, now we have a crazy blimp pilot. It seems to me that the legacy of Ancient Egypt could help a writer create some more interesting aspects to this movie. Well, I was wrong."
4,A Good Movie,"I went to see this movie twice and each time it got better. This was better than the first one and had better graphics. The only things I didn't like about the movie were those little creatures that were in the woods, the ones that shot the blow darts at the people. It looked too much at first like Jarassic Park, when the Raptors took the people under the weeds in the second one. It just looked really bad. My friend and I were laughing throughout that part! The only other part I didn't like was when The Rock came out at the end as the Squirpion King (I don't know how to spell it LOL). It just looked so fake!"
2,Don't buy this DVD,"Unless you want to line Universal's pocket, I'd advise you to stay away from this video.Don't get me wrong though, I like the movie. It's pretty good escapist entertainment. I don't try to read to much into such movies. It was fun. But Universal is most likely going to release this title in an Ultimate Edition package just like the last one. They also created Ultimate Editions for American Pie, Meet Joe Black and a few others. So if you like this movie wait for the Ultimate Edition."
1,The Mummy Returns,The Mummy Returns was a huge disappointment to me a huge fan of the great B movie fun of the first one I was absolutly disappointed by this unimaginative typical hollywood sequel formula shlock designed to seperate you from your money with the least amount of effort.Note to hollywood..special effects AND an intelligent story line are the keys to a good screenplay I already have dim hopes for the third installment yet to hit movie theatres.I would recomend to Mummy Fans save your dollar just go watch the first one again it at least frolicked in its own silliness enough to be fun or go watch Indiana Jones Nuff said...
3,Kinda fun,"For some reason, I enjoyed this movie more than the first one, perhaps because my expectations had been lowered by the original film. Maybe I was just in the mood to see a lot of things blow up real good. There's not much point describing the plot, because it's only a flimsy skeleton upon which to hang the action sequences, which go on pretty much non-stop from beginning to end. Everything is completely predictable, but it's humorous and moves fast. It's easily the best of the Mummy trilogy (counting ""Scorpion King""), but that's not saying much."
5,"PURE, NON-STOP ENTERTAINMENT!","Now this is what I call a movie! Not one of these boring, no FX movies! It's pure action/adventure from beginning to end. The story is a lot better than the first Mummy, and so is everything. The story is a continuation of the first story. Archeologists Rick and Evie have found an ancient bracelet which the reincarnated Mummy wants to use to take over the world. Sure, the dialogue is thin, the effects are cheesy, and a two-year-old could have thought of this plot, but who cares? It's entertainment, pure non-stop action adventure entertainment, and that's what it's all about."
5,Great Special Effects,Great photography and outstanding special effects. A move to see over and over just to enjoy the visual presentation.
5,Yes!,"It's even better this time around. Less gore, more fun. Of course it's campy--it's supposed to be. But aside from the not-quite-there later version of the Scorpion King, this movie's a romp from start to finish. Most of the main folk are back and there's ""you know...mummies...pygmies...big...bugs."" Give me this over any of those stupid dumb-joke popular flicks any day. Amusing, worthwhile characters and plenty of action. And thanks, Mr. Sommers, for bringing Ardeth Bey back. He's got too much talent to waste."
3,a ok movie,"It was better then the first one, and I was suprised. But if you liked the first one you will love this one. If you just thought the first one was ok then you will like this movie. But if you absolutly hated the first one then you probably will not like this one too much either."
3,THE MUMMY RETURNS,"What a shame for all Americans that they cannot broaden their minds to some kind of escapism for a change. Not everything needs to be black and white. Truthfully, the sequel is not as good as the original, but when you fancy sitting down and watching something other than the news, why not watch a tongue-in-cheek film, with spiffing good yarns and stiff upper lips. So to all the Americans slating this film, loosen up or your as dead as the mummies in the film."
4,More adventure less horror,"The first Mummy picture was much more of a horror/adventure movie with the human/love story thrown in almost as an afterthought. It was really pretty scarey and horrifying. The second Mummy story, albiet more special effects, is much more of an adventure story with more human focus. I wasn't scared at all, and there was none of the suspense that was in the first movie. There was more of a plot, I loved them both, the focus was just a bit different in each."
1,"Bad, Terrible, Awful, Horrid.....","OK, now I'll admit to sort-of liking the first installment, if for no other reason than it was a reasonably entertaining couple of hours.The sequel, however takes ""suspension of disbelief"" and throws it off a cliff. I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.And the upcoming ""Scorpion King"" looks even better....."
1,It stunk,This movie isnt even worth rental.Everthing was boring and the mummy was fully regenerated in the first 30 minutes.It wasnt evenworth the one star it got.
2,Very disappointing compared to the first.,"Brendan Fraser, et. al. give it their best try, but with a script this vacuous, a plot this meandering, and some truly bad special effects (the ending), there is only so much you can do.The first movie (1999's ""The Mummy"") is a modern classic. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a limp retread. I hear there is a third movie in the works, since the first two did so well financially, and I can only hope the franchise returns to the standards of quality and adventure that the first film embodied."
2,What a dissapointment,"I'm a big fan of the mummy so I expected that the mummy returns should be even better. What a misstake. The mummy return had no indiana jones spirit, and was know as witty as the first one. Rent it do know buy it inly if you like to see brendan and 101 animations.. :-(( Predictable movie"
4,all 5 DVDs Mummy 1& 2 Best of the best 1 to 4 and the others,"well totally pissed at first as the DVD's supplied were in the wrong region on all my diskes and this is not the first time evn all my other purchases were the wrong region, had so spend money to by a new DVD player so i'm stricken to what room i can watch these in...i ENJOY MY MOVIES and to have this restriction is a pain, other than this the movies are good...."
5,It's perfect and great...,"This movie was perfect and great. This movie was special because the sport wrestling star playing in, that was good. I was exciting and I like it. This movie was making up well. This movie CGI was great. This movie so cool, everyone enjoyed this movie. My favorite movie."
1,"Terrible, Terrible Movie!","I loved the previous and original 'Mummy' movies, but 'The Mummy Returns' is a complete insult to the audience. The overwhelming, annoying amount of special effects? (Do you remember the cheesy images of the Scorpion King at the end? What was he doing winking at the camera?) The plot that completely forgets that of the previous 'Mummy' movie? There are many actors in this movie with some great potential that spend the whole movie ""acting"" to the special effects? The only thing we are telling the Hollywood studios, by making this movie one of the highest-grossing of the year, is that we want computer special effects to take the place of real acting and story. If we quit wasting our money on terrible movies like this, Hollywood will realize that we are tired of stupid movies like this and start making real films again!I want two hours of my life back!"
1,SO VERY STUPID & CGI SATURATED!!!,"First off, did all you people see the same stupid & overblown movie I saw? How can any of you say this film is even entertaining to a bus full of cretins? The computer graphics are so overblown that the movie may as well have been a cartoon! Terrible acting, awful & predictable plot, lousy special effects! Too much! A flying pirate ship? Let's leave the supernatural to the mummies & the realistic to the humans. I really & truly can't understand what anyone would like about this idiotic waste of time. Trust me & ignore every other review!"
1,Chock full of dumb,"The Mummy was a dumb movie, but it was a big, fun dumb movie. It managed to weave a bunch of old movie cliches together in a novel way and package it with some fun performances and neat special effects. The Mummy Returns is a dumb movie, but it's not fun, it's just dumb. You can pull something like The Mummy off once, but forget about trying any sequels. Summary: AVOID"
1,THIS MOVIE [STINKS],"Normally I would never write a review, I just don't. But as we have all learned from this past week, terror stirrs us to action. Don't even spend time thinking about spending money on this movie. This movie was almost as bad as Battlefield Earth! Plus, it is in some pre-order competition with the Simpson's Complete 1st season, so don't let the world think that this moivie is even a little good! Help Brendan Fraiser save the world from the Mummy, by not buying it, or even talking about it, or saying the name of the movie out loud!"
4,"Fantastic special effects, Good entertainment value","If you want a deep story line that is completely believable this is NOT the movie for you. If you want to be entertained and dazzled by some great special effects then don't miss it. After working a high-stress filled day at the office, plop down on the couch and slide this into the VCR and enjoy! Some of the other reviewers state that not much character development exists from the first movie to this one, but I disagree. There is a tatoo that is significant (watch the movie to find out why), as well as some past life regressions that further expand on one character. The recreation of the Scorpion Kings realm was absolutely awesome!. Yes, the story line is a bit far-fetched, but wasn't starwars, ET, Lord of the Rings, and just about every other great film?"
4,"Great special effects, okay storyline.","This movie had so many special effects, it is overwhelming at times. They definitely spent more time on the effects than the storyline. This is a good movie to own and you will enjoy it, but don't expect too much from the story."
3,An good sequel.,"After 10 years ago: Rick (Brendan Fraser), Evie (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) though, they destory the mummy. The mummy Imothep found ressurection along with a force even more powerful, The Scoprion King (Dwayne Johnson). As making hangs in the balance. Rick & Evie embark in a more dangerous mission to a race to save the world.DVD`s has strong anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) format and the same goes for the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. Included an running commentary track by the director:Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising), outtakes and more. Entertaining sequel with a few good surprises, Great Fun. Panavision. Grade:B."
3,"good movie, bad format","I got The Mummy Returns on dvd for Christmas and I was pretty excited. I think it's a really good movie. I went to watch it this morning and only after opening it did I discover that they bought the widescreen format. Since I have a regular tv it's terrible. The picture is only on half the screen and I gave up watching. So while I think this movie is great, DON'T buy widescreen unless you have a wide screen tv. It sucks!"
1,Dumb...,"I just saw this movie last night and It amazes me that The Mummy Returns made as much money as it did in the box office. I believe the theaters should have pad us to see this one. The first Mummy was OK, but not great. I would have given it two stars at the most. But this one only gets one, and that's because I had to put a star up there. If I had a the option it would have got a big fat goose egg. If you plan on buying The Mummy Returns... please return it."
1,i have seen better 3rd grade plays,"I thought this was going to be a good movie, WRONG!! I want 2 hours of my life back. The acting was bad, the story was terrible, and the visual effects were even worse."
1,What a waste of time,"This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions."
3,Definitely an inferior sequel.,"The title surmises it all: once again, the power-hungry mummy, Imhotep, returns to wreak havoc and conquer the world with the aid of the Anubis warriors, and only adventurers Rick and Evelyn O'Connell can stop him. Big-budget and incredibly lavish adventure film is filled to the brim with non-stop action, and unfortunately, very little of it is genuinely fun or thrilling. The jokes rarely work this time around (mostly silly without being funny), the special effects are often too silly and overused, the character interaction that made much of the original film so enjoyable is gone, and what we have here is a ""rollercoaster ride"" in desperate need of a jumpstart. Fraser and Weisz still make a great couple, and the movie is still watchable. But, I hate to say this, I just can't recommend the film. The 1999 original is still one of the best adventure films around, too bad this one ain't.** 1/2 out of *****"
1,Ugh. Should be Zero Stars,"The title of the review says it all. This was the worst movie of the year, and one of the few times I ever wished I had walked out of the theater early. Special effects cannot make up for a thin, unbelievable plot. If you are going to set a movie in the real world, nearly a century ago, try and stick with historically accurate props and storylines. A rocket powered blimp just doesn't cut it."
4,Why did The Mummy Return?,"ANswer: I don't know. THe original was better in every way-better story, better acting, better everything.This one is none of the above. It's okay but unnecessary."
2,Terrible,"The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because they spent so much money on special effects that I felt bad just giving it one. This movie is absolutely the worst film I've seen this year. Unless of course you're into weak characters, stupid one liners, and a wise cracking kid that gets more annoying by the minute. It's predictable, and not worth the energy spent sitting through it."
5,Rare Sequel that surpasses the original.,"This Film And Shriek were the ONLY Great films we had this summer, and were the only films in general that delivered what it promise. The Mummy Returns is a super charge spectacular that surpasses the original In every way. The acting is top notch, and the girls are beautiful (Rachel Weisz is HOT). The Special Effects are top notch, and the action is amazing. It's probably one of the best sequels ever made, and it's definitely one DVD to own. Get it and prepare to be blown away by it."
1,one of the worst movies I have ever seen,"Please, do not waste your time watching this movie. It is not only a waste of time, but a waste of money too. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I almost left when I watched it at the cinema."
1,"OK as a monocular, not a binocular","I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel. I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had, or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical. Mine went back. A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain. If you buy these, buy them from a place with a good return policy. Keep the packaging and invoice."
4,Pure 20X80 POWER!!!,"I have been very impressed with these binoculars. They work very well for looking across Lake Union and scopeing out the downtown skyline. I saved over $100 by buying them on AMAZON as well.These powerful binoculars are big and heavy. But so am I, so I can hold them steady without too much trouble. Most people are going to want a tripod, especially for astronomy use. They don't like to work through glass. Some people have a hard time focusing them. I have a hard time focusing out double images through glass and at night time. But the more I use them the better I become at focusing them. Zhumell has a great lifetime warentee on their products.Despite their minor problems that can be worked out through a little practice I love these binoculars. I have used these for almost a month now. Everytime I use them I think to my self that it was the best purchase that I have made in a very long time.Get these binoculars."
4,Super Binoculars,They Were Great Binoculars But I Had To Sent Them Back They Were Too Big For What Wanted Them For.
5,Finally a tea kettle that works!!!,I love my new tea kettle. I have had several and been dis-satisfied with the way the whistle is much too weak. I need one that sounds the ALARM! This one is terrific. I highly recommend it!
3,Good Grips Tea Kettle,"This is about my 3rd OXO Good Grips tea kettle--I looooove their products, they make the best paring knife and vegetable peeler, I've given as gifts many times, not to mention other products I have of theirs. I love the tea kettle as well, but since I purchased this one, (a replacement for the last one I had many years--ruined by a friend) I notice the quality is not nearly as good as it's predecessor, disappointing."
1,Help!!! I'm Melting...,"I bought this as one of my mom's Christmas gifts. Within 2 days the spout cover (not sure if that is the proper name) was melting! The tea kettle was barely used and was not burned or mistreated. Needless to say, I have returned this item for one without a plastic spout cover.Good luck if you actually buy this kettle! I am shocked because OXO usually has great products!"
5,A little hard to fill,"It is a little hard to fill, other than that, it's a great, solidly built kettle. The pick me up feature works great. Keeps you from having to get close to the steam and burn your fingers. We fill ours from a water filter, which may make it more difficult, so I'm still giving it 5 stars. If you fill from a kitchen, it would probably be just fine."
1,Nasty Metallic Taste,We will be looking forward to throwing it out because it gives off a nasty metallic taste after heating the water. We thought it was the tap water but it is indeed the kettle. It makes me pretty upset because my wife drinks a few cups of tea everyday and I dont know what kinds of metals/toxins she is ingesting. Please beware. We had a Zojirushi hot water pot that broke during our move across the country. Please check that out...its the way to go although it costs $100+. They are popular in Japan. We will be getting another one and forget about any kind of kettle from now on.
5,Oxo Good Grips Tea Kettle,"It's excellent, and much lighter than other models. It works just as well, but there's no strain lifting the full kettle."
3,Whistle Blower,"I am another dissapointed one, after six months, my whistle stopped working too. I use my teapot twice a day. The handle got a bit crooked and some sort of glue started comming out from around the spout.I just can't respond in the morning without my tea whistle. I left it on the burner too long (15 minutes) and the enamle (red) burned onto the burner."
1,Poor quality,"After just a couple months of use on a gas stove, the plastic cap over the pour spout melted. It eventually cracked and fell off. Guess you're supposed to boil your water on a simmer."
3,Detailed but boring!,"in line with pimsleur ""repeat after me"" methodology... lots of good info but very dry and boring to listen too... once again... If only Michel Thomas would do more langauges!"
1,Useless,"I didn't get very far with this cd series so my review will not be very thorough or technical. But what I would have wanted to know before I made my purchase, is that it is a very regional dialect that is spoken in this cd set (Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian dialect). Which is fine if that is what you need, but since my husband is Egyptian, I would like to be able to communicate with him and his family in their own dialect. It was actually pretty comical listening to the first cd with him because he kept saying, ""What? No, we say it this way..."" until we just turned it off.The Egyptian dialect is also more widely recognized throughout the Arab world since Egyptian movies, music, etc. are a big part of Middle Eastern popular culture - so even if you don't have Egyptian family, I think that it would not make sense to learn the spoken Arabic with this dialect - it's difficult enough already!"
4,Fun and simple game.,"This is a great game, for four or five people. Moves along and is simple to understand."
3,I Prefer The TV Show,"Good as action goes, lame as story goes. Acting was solid and the effects were good for DVD but the story was messy and I was pining for the intelligence of the TV series."
2,RE: Mission Impossible,"By and large, the movie fails because it strays too far from the premise of the TV show and ventures into 007 and Bourne territory.No IMF team, no suspense, poor story.The TV series is far superior."
2,.,"Mm. Truly a poor and silly film. If you took an episode of the old series and drained out everything that was interesting, and replaced it all with cliches, bad dialogue, flat characters, a boring story, and gimmicky, over-the-top ""plot twists"" -- you'd have this. There's just nothing remotely good about it -- *except* for the famous scene in which Cruise is suspended in that high-security room trying to retreive -- a disk or something? (It's been a while.) This one scene -- is very good. Crafty, suspenseful, and quite well edited from what I remember. If you decide to rent this movie (god forbid you *buy* it!) -- I would recommend fast-forwarding until you reach this scene, watching it, and then moving on, to spend the remainder of your day or evening in a more productive and enriching fashion. You might want to take a peek at the climax action sequence too, it's fairly original (although WAY over-the-top) and pretty to see."
2,Impossible,"Your impossible misson? Trying to watch this movie, and finding anything comprehensible about the plot. Tom Cruise said in an interview that it IS possible to follow the plot (but, obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out!). But does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times, to get all the dialogue details? Movies are not like books. In theaters, you can't flip back five pages, to refresh in your mind who a certain character is. So things should be spelled out with CLARITY. Something this film is woefully lacking. Having said that, DePalma is a great stylist-director, and as a music video, this isn't a total loser. But as a movie, it is."
3,Mission Impossible,This was the first MI out of the gate. I think Tom was too young not convincing and the story was predictable. I really like his new MI G Protocal
4,Mission Impossible (HD-DVD),I'm a fan of Mission Impossible movies. I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
3,Was better in the 90's,"This is one of those things that's better left for the 90's. Especially when watched on an HDTV, you can see some of the makeup and some of the ""acting"". If you haven't seen this, you might enjoy it. But if you remember seeing it and it was awesome (in the 90s) you might be better off leaving it at that and just enjoying the memory -- and then go watch Thor or something else if you're in the mood for action."
3,GOOD MOVIE,I THOUGHT THIS WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE FOR WHAT IT WAS. BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO WIN AN AWARDS THATS FOR SURE
3,"Loose, Clunky Storytelling That's Rescued by Some Great Action","Although it absolutely reeks of '90s blockbuster cliches, a confident performance from Tom Cruise and two or three truly great action sets ultimately save the first M:I from the dregs of mediocrity. The plot is a bit too twisty-turny for its own good, with perhaps ninety percent of the cast switching allegiances at least once before it's through, but that's kind of its thing and I can write off a few eccentricities in the name of identity. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are wasted as generic lackeys, though, and the vital makeup effects aren't nearly as good as I had remembered. The magic of watching a guy rip off a faceful of fake skin is sort of lost when I can immediately identify who's wearing it as soon as they step on-screen. Though campy at times, it's still worth a watch for the perfect, trendsetting blend of action and suspense it brings to several key moments."
4,Even better on Blu-ray,"I always liked the first theatrical installment of Mission: Impossible with Tom Cruise. However, now that I can view at home on my Blu-ray disc player and HDTV, it's even better!I had previously purchased Mission: Impossible 3 (my favorite) on regular DVD. But after seeing what the first one looked liked, I started thinking ""I need to get number 3 on Blu-ray, too!""The picture is astounding, along with the sound. The detail crisp and clear. You won't be disappointed."
4,Good flick,"I enjoyed this film not only because of the great action but because you get to try to figure out a mystery. While I was watching it with some friends I jokingly guessed who the ""mole"" was and who was in on the scheme with him. Little did I know that I had guessed right and it was exciting to watch the plot unfold. Although I was not completely blown away by the special effects, it could be because I only saw this movie on video and not in the theatre where it should be viewed. Lots of action, good intense scenes, gotta use your head a little -- a good flick."
4,An almost-excellent action film...,"""Mission: Impossible"" is a nearly perfect film. If it weren't so darn confusing at times, it would be an absolutely wonderful movie. However, it boggles itself down with too much dialogue and confusing plot twists. But it's no doubt a highly-enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who has been betrayed and now must prove his innocence. This is the most of the plot of which we know for sure. The other details are too complicated to really understand, but they don't matter. What matters is the constantly suspenseful moments including the beginning where Hunt and team are chasing after a bad guy to the heist Hunt makes in the CIA building to the incredible helicopter-chasing-the-train sequence that makes up the film's climax. There's much to enjoy in this movie and, if you watch it a few times, it even begins to make sense. I highly recommend it to any action fan who doesn't mind thinking every now and then. It's a superb action flick."
4,surprising & thrilling,it was a really good movie. it really keeps you on the egde of your seat. the ending is quite surprising. the movie was action packed and pretty good.
4,So much fun!,"The only reason this movie doesn't get 5 stars is that it is a little hard to keep up with. The complicated plot takes so many twists I had to see it twice to follow them all. Otherwise smart, excellent fun!"
5,Good action movie,"Its really a collectors edition. All the 1st part of the movie series are the best, like wise.........."
4,almost cartoony but watchable,"I have the standard DVD which was good but the HD DVD is super;highly recommended.As for the movie,it is good but the main point is that it is one of those few movies which allows repeated watching without becoming boring.One of the reasons why it is so, is that it will make you go back to 'CIA break in' and wonder how they did it;being a SINGAPOREAN, I think they made it look too easy to infiltrate the CIA.Thanks"
3,so so,"Pretty good special effects, not a real plot, sometimes too much unrealistic. The right movie to watch at when you have nothing better to do."
3,Sound was lackluster - video is low resolution,"I was not impressed by Paramounts lousy effort at transferring this movie to DVD. They were late in the game to bring out DVDs, and now they have added insult to injury by doing a crummy job of it.When I saw that the disc was dual layered, I thought, here is someone who is going for quality (not willing to sacrifice in compression) - WRONG.They put both the standard and widescreen formats on the same side. The disc is not anamorphic - so if you have a projector, you will be diappointed.What will be noticed by everyone is the poor sound. The laserdisc BLOWS AWAY the sound on the DVD (the helicopter train scene was much more dramatic on laserdisc).Needless to say, I was disappointed - not just by this disc, but by the fact that Paramount doesn't seem to be taking this medium seriously.- Jonathan"
3,a ok movie that has nothing to do with series really,"If you take this movie on it's own without the knowledge of the original series you can enjoy it on the level of a good spy movie. But if you want what the original series was about: a TEAM of people fighting evil international forces who want to destroy democracy , then forget about it. And that holds true for the sequels as well. Instead of fighting international badguys; it is all traitors and other evil american stereotypical villians. Which is ok for this movie, but it makes the other two sequels just lame. There is a whole world of bad evil forces out there and all we get is traitors and evil americans? Still in spite of that fact this movie is a good spy movie and it's well made on every other level. The blu ray looks great and is well worth owning if you want this movie. Still how lame is it that they didn't have a real character driven team in any of the three movies?"
3,Different in Sound,The sound effects and back ground music is not as clear as my 4x3 DVD version. Both versions (DVD & BD) are recorded in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound yet the DVD version plays a loader and clearer sound. The video is much better but that is because of the DVD is 4x3 in 480i and BD is 16x9 in 1080p High Definition.Mission Impossible (Special Collector's Edition)
1,The Worst movie of the decade!,"This movie broke down on numerous occasions into the realm of the unbelievable. Even fantasy and sci-fi movies present ideas and events in a way that the audience can accept as logical for the story. But Mission Impossible contains scenes that are stupid, illogical, unnecessary, and unrealistic.Why would a man who is a genius and the mastermind of the MI Force betray his country and his friends for a mere million dollars when he could easily obtain it legally? Why would this man turn his back on his enemy to kill his friend? How could a man survive a helicopter explosion while traveling at high speed in a tunnel?This is not just a bad movie, it is an insult to all fans of the TV series. Obviously the producers did not care about that. They are only after a quick buck from the name recognition. This is SHAMEFUL!"
4,The best of the series,"Despite the disc I received(with 2 scratches on the back)I think this is the best of the series that lauched Tom Cruise career(which had other sucesses).I'm a bit dissapointed about this Special Edition.No making off are in the disc only some featurettes focusing Tom Cruise and the story of Mission Impossible in the last 40 years since it's first TV series.Just a few trailers and tears focusing mostly on MIF 3.I really wanted to see the rolling of the film and how the stunts and FX were created(ILM,Blue screen shots and at).Anyway a very entertaining film that will make u watch many times."
1,Why is this called Mission Impossible?,"First off I enjoyed the film greatly. Having said that, why make a film and call it Mission Impossible then make it so that it is the exact opposite of the TV series. I could just about accept the plot apart from the apalling travesty of making the baddie Jim Phelps. I would like to know how Paramount could sanction this. It is no wonder Peter Graves wanted nothing to do with it."
3,Not as good as I remember. BAD BLU-RAY transfer!,"I didn't buy this, and thank goodness for that! I rented the BR via Netflix for my new A/V setup, and let me tell you, this was the WORST quality transfer of a Blu-ray disc I've seen yet. I can't believe they even have this on BR. The sound was fine, but there were so many glitches, pixelation & quality of color/depth issues, I could barely enjoy the film. And I was really looking forward to a spectacular home theater experience that'd blow me away, after a long day.The film itself I hadn't seen since it originally came out in the theater. Boy, I thought I liked it better than I did. Pretty cheesy. Cruise's acting probably the best part of it all. Parts 2 & 3 are next, and I believe I liked those better. We shall see.Don't waste your money on this Blu-ray. Rent it instead."
5,Mission Impossible,This movie stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt who's Covert Team have all been assassinated..And everyone thinks he's done it..So he's on the run and trying to find the real killer..This movie has great special effects and gadgets that u would only dream of..
5,Mission Impossible I is back with a vengence!,"This DVD is really great. That's just about all there is too it. You can choose to watch the widescreen or standard versions of the movie, and both show up beautifully. There's not much more to say. Sound is awesome, video quality is awesome - and the Mission is Impossible! Get this DVD if you liked the VHS version, or if you wanna try it, or if - if ANYTHING!!"
3,I liked it but...,the action in the film seems to fake somehow I don't know and can't put my finger on it. I really love this film but something was definitely off. However I saw a preveiw of part 2 next summer and John Woo is directing it should be awsome!
2,"uh,...",Maybe I'm not that bright....but I didn't get it. Some good actions scenes though and fans Tom Cruise and the original TV series seem to enjoy it. Worth a rental I guess.
1,Mission Horrible,"Mission Impossible TV Series had some bad chapters especially duringthe Sixth and Seventh Seasons. However, these Episodes were muchbetter than this Film starring Tom Cruise. This is really a horriblemovie."
2,Borring!,"With the exception of the scene of Ethan trying to recover the gold disk in a cable and the final action sequence with the helicopter exploding in the tunel,this movie is simply a piece of junk!I fell asleep on most part of it and i was very disapointed with it!Mission Impossible 2 was clearly better,though not that spectacular,but i really enjoyed that movie.The fact that this was a big success is beyond me.Skip this one and get the sequel.You'll be glad you did!"
2,A fantastic movie ruined by lousy DVD productions.,"Being a fan of the original ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series, I was impressed with the story line and production efforts of the movie. Instead of giving everything away upfront, they handed it to you piece by piece. I felt that this was true-to-form of the original series.What ruined it was the lame effort to transfer the movie to DVD. Paramount has a problem of grabbing all the money on the latest fads without giving any concerns as to what the fans want. All they did was provide you with a couple of screen formats, a few audio a caption options, and a copy of the movie trailer. Big deal!If you like the movie and want to have a copy of your home library, consider the VHS version. But if you're looking for a quality DVD, this is NOT the one."
4,A remake that's good,"DePalma directing Tom Cruise, the biggest actor in Hollywood, in a Summer blockbuster. You wouldn't have believed it could happen. Well, it did, and Mission : Impossible is a fast, fun action flick, that is pure enjoyment. Cruise is fine, apart from one scene where Jon Voight asks if there are any questions. The camera suddenly moves to Cruise, who asks whether they can get better coffee. A fine support cast is used, and the twist, the betrayal of Ethan Hunt by his boss, Jim Phelps is unexpected. Some claim the film betrays the Tv series, but I don't accept that. The TV series was fantastic, but this film isn't a straight copy. It offers something different. An enjoyable 100 minutes or so."
5,Great Movie,"Because the movie didn't feel like the show is irrelevant. In case some have forgotten, we're in the 1990's. I will admit that I had to watch it twice to get the story right, but that doesn't take away from the movie's intrigue. I bet most people who watched this movie never saw the show. Good. Mission Impossible 2 is in the works and I can't wait."
1,I was dissappointed,"Fans of the TV series should be dissappointed and angry that a good show has gotten into the wrong hands. There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all."
2,Blu Ray Quality,"The movie itself is great, but the blu ray isn't very good. It is quite grainy in some scenes and you can clearly see imperfections of the film in certain shots. I have some DVDs that look equally good when ""upscaled"" in my Panasonic BDT210... Long story short, I doubt most people would see a difference from the DVD version for a fraction of the cost."
5,"Simple Plot, What's The Problem?","I've heard from so many people that the main problem with ""Mission Impossible"" is its plot, that it's ""impossible"" to inderstand, when in fact it is very easy to understand. In short, Tom Cruise is trying to clear his name by finding the real traitor of the team. Redgrave knows who that person is and promises to tell Cruise, but in return, he must get her the noc file, that's what that whole ""acrobat"" seen is about. They plan to meet on the train, and the rest is history. Okay now?"
3,Mission Impossible,Jim Phelps would never betray his country or his honor. That bit of cinematic heresy forever spoiled any possible enjoyment of this rather mundane film.
4,de palma: cruise,"Brian De Palma's (Carrie; Scarface; The Untouchables) 1996 action film starring Tom Cruise and Jon Voight is a pretty good action film. Well, once you suspend all belief. But that is what this movie is about. Putting real life on hold and believing in the impossible, the fantastic. Cruise, an excellent dramatic actor, does a great job crossing over into an action star--even with the bad haircut. Lots of cool gadgets and interesting scenarios and that great Mission: Impossible theme. And it is great to see the intimidating Ving Rhames casted as a computer genius/geek. Inspired casting."
4,Great Movie,"This is a great movie through and through. I watched this one in the cinema, then again on DVD not long ago, and let me tell you, i thought i was back in that cinema all over again, the sound quality is great, and the picture is crisp, and the movie itself is mindblowing. Speaking of the actuall movie, it is a fast paced, thought inducing, twisted, tale of a traitor, and a hero, your classic theme when it come to the Mission Impossible series, but thats just the ticket to this adventure. I even believe this to be better that M:I2 which has just hit cinemas, buy it today."
3,Hold on to your pillow!,"I'll definitely be able to admit Mission:Impossible was disappointing, but one good thing was it managed to keep me enthralled and informed the whole way through. But, alas, something is missing - this film didn't have the cleverness of The Matrix of the sexiness of The World Is Not Enough. The screenplay could of been much better, too. But, not all the film is not bad - the cinematography is good, the special effects are brilliant and the train chases and sound are good, too.If you are big on action movies with thrills and chills, I totally recommend this. For anyone else, the only advice I can give is - HOLD ON TO YOUR PILLOW, it's a wild ride!"

1,Darn it,"I ordered three of the Mission Impossible DVD's but from different places. When I tried to watch this dvd, it would not play. It arrived in on time just wasn't able to watch it. Darn it."
5,Just as Expected!,We received Mission Impossible Blu-ray edition in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Was new and had never been used and works like a charm. No complaints.
5,High-tech High-spy High-good,"This is a high-tech spy movie that is very good. Cruise puts in one of his best performances and the other actors perform excellently. There is enough variety to keep some suspense going. There is certainly enough action, without having to resort to blow up everything in sight (like some other ""summer"" blockbusters). The transfer to DVD is excellent and the other sound and editing are very good."
1,Only if You Love Tom Cruise,"And unfortunately so many people do. Blatant vanity project, the movie's saved only when director Brian DePalma kicks in with his brand of blazing comic book action - which is great, yes, but not enough this time around. Complicated plot? Phooey. Annoying is more like it."
1,"If you're a fan of the television series, skip to MI 2","As an avid fan Bruce Geller's Mission Impossible and its iconic characters and cast, I was aghast at this film and despise it. Anyone who has any affection for Peter Graves and his inimitable portrayal of the heroic Jim Phelps is forewarned.That said, I do like the MI franchise, and find 2, 3, and 4 very entertaining."
2,Rubbish.,"One of the endless remakes these days, Mission Impossible is, like The Saint, a flop. It's main problem is the plot. I simply didn't understand it. The good guy is the bad guy, whos sort of the good guy... Ofcourse, it's all swamped in explosions and various visuals, but there is little to compliment. Tom Cruise is okay,but John Voight is awful. On the whole, watch something else."
1,Outdated,"The book was published in 1996 and with the extensive construction in new bike paths that occurred in metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson since that time, it is very much out-of-date.Also, since when is northern (and southern for that matter) California in the southwestern US?"
1,Sof'feet Callus kit - bad product,"Hi, this is a bad product in my opinion. The best way to do this is to use a glycolic acid product like Glytone 29.5% Ultra Heel and Elbow Cream. This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result. Just need to use some care with it's use like everything else but it does a great job much easier."
4,Recommended,"There's something poetic in Cameron's writing here that kept surprising and delighting me. Keen observations told in direct but simple phrases. I don't agree with the reviewers who dismiss this book because it fails their accuracy test- to me it is a work of fiction, a closed world that reflects our feelings, not facts. For me it is an extremely sad book dealing with desperation, grief and loss, lies and self-deception. The way the narrator manipulates, or attempts to manipulate, the world around him, particularly women, unnerves me. Yet it does so because this touches on the truth of how many smart but desperate people interface with the world."
3,ok,was not what i was expecting it was ok I was hoping for better graphics and a more simple way to teach addition. It may just not have been the right level for my 4 year olds but I will probably keep it around and use it in a few years
2,Interesting reading but the NOT Economic FACTS,"I was hoping to find more substance in the book but I did not. There are NOT FACTS to back his claims nor data to prove his theories.The book presents basic Economics but for advanced readers of Economics, it will not work.It lacks the foundations of a solid book... FACTS.But two stars is plenty."
5,necesssary read,"Every citizen of the United States would benefit from reading this book. If only our politicians would read it as well. Clear, concise, well argued, Sowells book is an excellent, informative and thoughtfull read."
5,How not to be fooled by the politicians,"Great book written for non-economics students to understand the long term effects of popular issues. The chapter on housing costs simply but brilliantly explains the folly of rent control, zoning control, hi-rise prevention, etc. and how they hurt the common person.Great read if you don't want to remain in the fog of the political vote buyers."
4,Wonderful Vidio!,"This vidio, produced by the same people who did ""Bibleman"" is among the best I've ever seen.When Mickey and Grant get assigned to make a daring rescue, there attempts to find someone who will help them result in a close brush with death that makes Mickey question wether God wants him to even be an Agent of Truth. (...)Asside from the fact that it's rather predictable in some points, it's and exclent movie. Some things can easly be predicted if you're at all fimmiler with spy movies. Needless to say, it's high-action, but it's the kind of action you can just kick back and watch while eating popcorn fresh from the micorwave.Mickey Masters is a quite typical young teenager, and he has a typical kid life."
5,All you need to know to live in Mexico,I spent three months living and working in Mexico and this was a great guide to get settled in with a lot of relevant information! A great read!
3,Simplistic,"I was looking for more practical information regarding real estate purchase. The descriptions of different areas may prove to be useful, holding off final judgement until I get there Jan'06."
2,Haven't read!,"This book is not what I expected. Therefore, I haven't read any of it. Maybe one day I will pick it up again."
5,The Best,"Having read a variety of handbooks for travel in Mexico, this book is by far the best. This book is about Mexico, not Mexican hotels, and equips the reader to move respectfully through Mexico viewing events there with a fond but clear eye."
2,Not up to par,"Based on the first week of use, I have to say I'm disappointed. There are 2 problem areas - first, the adjustment screw for the flame doesn't work right; second, the valve for refilling the lighter with butane seems to leak badly. Maybe I'm just not doing it right, but I've tried to figure out a way to refill & just seem to keep getting leaks. Also, I can't tell how much butane is getting in - probably not much since the lighter doesn't keep the flame for long."
5,nice,"my husband is going to love it ... great presentation - fast shippment - just nice ... ,,,, ,,, ,,,"
3,So So Dependability...,"I really like this lighter. It's main problem is it's NOT dependable. One light is high, the next light is low, one flame may be higher than the other. I have done everything to adjust the flame (flames) to no avail. Like I wrote, I DO like this lighters feel. I'm hoping it will eventually break-in."
4,high quality cards,"These cards are perfect for any game, durable and of the highest quality. The only downsize is that they don't come in a hard case, only in a tray, which makes it rather difficult to store them and take them from one place to another. You need to take care of the carton box they come in, and I'm not a big fan of those boxes."
5,"I loved this book, it was exactly what I was looking for!","This is the best career resource I have ever read. It was packed with detailed information and resources about medical transcription, setting up a business, taxes, education - you name it. I found it all in this book. The authors tell it like it is and are clearly are keeping abreast of the industry trends and they live and breathe their topic. I highly recommend this book to potential MTs, MT students, and seasoned MTs. There is something to learn for everyone here! Thank you for this outstanding resource! KM, South Lake Tahoe."
2,It's informative but....,"This book can be informative at times but most of the time, I felt like I was reading the book version of the home shopping channel. If you're already a transcriptionist, you don't need this book. And if you're a newbie, The Medical Transcription Career Handbook has more and better eye-openers to help you get started."
2,Outdated,"Probably the most common reason to purchase this book is to gain information about becoming an independent medical transcriptionist, but I really was disappointed with this book as far as that is concerned. Technology and medicine both advance and change on a daily basis which leaves this book, printed in 2002, in somewhat of a dark age, especially now that the most cost effective, time efficient, and popular way of transferring all sorts of data is electronically.While there is some good information in this book, I don't think the amount of information that is relevant is worth the price. Most of this stuff can be found on the internet more accurately than in the pages of this book."
4,Get this if you're thinking of a transcription career,I bought this book when I started thinking about going into medical transcription. It answered a lot of my questions. It also includes some good ideas about what to do with your current medical transcription career.
2,Capsule Count misleading,"Based on the price, I thought I was getting 180-count. Actually received only 90-count. Re-Reviewed the order site and NO COUNT WAS MENTIONED !!!!VERY MISLEADING. WILL NEVER ORDER HERE AGAIN !"
3,Too Soon To Tell,I have not had any liver tests since I started taking Liv-52 so I have no opinion yet
2,hmmm.,"Maybe this is one of those albums that gets better over time after you have listened to it for a few times. I've tried, I've really tried.I am a big Palace fan since I first heard ""New Partner"" on the radio and have collected a lot of Oldham's music since. This is my least favorite album. None of the songs stick, the melody's are not outspoken and the lyrics are not the best he has ever done. Of course there are some songs that are not bad like 'Bolden Boke Boy' but the overal tone of the album is just not that good.However, having read the other reviews, I'll try to listen to it a little more and maybe I will change my mind, in that case you will hear from me with a new revies."
2,oldham's worst album,"I love everything else he's done but this album has always seemed LACKING to me. It's got a few great songs but a lot of it seems RUSHED, a bit too jokey and loose, and the lyrics are definitely sub-par compared to ARISE THEREFORE."
4,Table Saw Book,"Very good quality book. Pages are thick and coated to aid in protecting the life of the book. Content is good. Has several jigs to build for your table saw, general information on table saws, and several projects to build."
4,Great Info !!!,The Complete Table Saw Book was a great help to me when I had purchased my first table saw last summer. The information was easy to understand and apply to what I was doing. The author's insightful comments and remarks were very helpful. Great book and well worth the cost.
1,THIS BOOK SUCKED!,"This book really sucked! I don't know about the cassetes, butI can say for a fact that the book was so awful I was boredpractically to tears. That's not to say that it was quite asbad as ""Weatherhawk"", but it was pretty close! Don't botherto buy or borrow ""Stealth"". Spend your money on more worthwhilebooks."
1,Complete Garbage,"I bought this case expecting from what I heard to not be as good as quality as the XCM but I was very surprised to find out just how bad the quality really was. After ordering this case from Ghost Case I recived the order fairly quick, opened the box and it was a disaster. I recived 2 tops, 2 bezels, and Two DVD spindles, No bottom, so it gets worse, Only one face bezels in the box was the way it should be every other piece in the box had a huge crack on it or busted chips out of it. Just handling one of the tops and seeing how bad it would look by placing on my xbox it went on without that tight of a fit but low and behold another crack :( These cases are garbage and should be avoided like the plauge."
3,Awesome shell for the Xbox,"My cousin encouraged me to buy this shell for the Xbox and I thought it would look cool with all the led lights glowing inside of it (it's modified). The shell isn't that strong though which I dislike because it was $30... It was a tough fit, but my cousin manage to squeeze it on my Xbox, though he broke the screws and now the DVD drive won't work now because of him. Other then that it makes my Xbox look awesome. Now I gotta remember not to look at it to avoid looking into the red laser when it's on..."
5,"SOS: A Girl's Guide Sex, Optimism, Surviving 21st Century","Clever, funny, witty and full of contemporary wisdom, this book is a must for women of all ages. From how to change a tyre to how to change a man, this is the ultimate how-to for modern living. Give it to your best friend as well as your grandmother. An enjoyable read."
1,installation nightmare,"I bought this item based on what I thought would be a seemless transition from my ATT DSL provided modem to this modem. What a nightmare. 2 days of telephone conversations with ATT and Zoom and I finally got a connection..kinda. Each side said ""it's fine at this end, you need to talk to the other guy"". I now have a connection that works sometime. This thing is going back."
5,Much better than the modem from the DSL provider!,I had a Westell modem which liked to simply disconnect from the internet whenever it felt like it. The download transfer rate averaged around 40k and I was told this was as fast as I could possibly obtain due to my address being along the fringes of the DSL coverage area.After getting fed up with the Westell I purchased this modem and my download transfer rate now averages in the 300k range and jumps over 1MB quite often. I know a lot has to do with server location but nothing else changed but the modem. My browsing habits have been the usual for the past week.Installation was very easy. Very. It performs exactly as I expected and the price wasn't bad either.
1,I didn't receive it yet.,"I don't know the reason that I didn't receive it yet.Even I paid already.And there is no response at all.I ask the reason and what happened again.If you sent it, could you track my package?Thanks."
3,Decorating with White,"This is a beautiful book, the photography is splendid and it's full of great decorating ideas, advice, and tips! I was hoping it would have a little more modern edge to it, there seems to be a lot of olde world type decorating."
3,Emerson CKS1851 Dual Snooze doesn't work,"Emerson Smartset Dual Alarm Clock- CKS1851Pros: Style and overall clock is fine and dual alarms are fine. Easy enough too use. Radio is okay if you use just to wake up which is what I use it for. Not for listening as your stereo system, etcA great function is the cascade alarm for buzzer. When it goes off starts low volume but increases in volume until you turn it off.Cons: (1)The time between alarm going off when pressing snooze is about 9 mins which is really longer than I would like.(2) I can set two alarms to buzzer and radio (in any order), problem is that only one of these will have the snooze function when both are set. In other words as soon as the second alarm goes off and you press snooze it cancels the first alarms snooze but keeps its snooze function. I can live with that also as long as one snooze will be functioning."
4,Hooked,"This was such an intriguing film! It was very refreshing to see a film that wasn't cut and dried right and wrong. It was real and raw and realistic in the portral of the situation. Well acted, with emotions you could feel."
5,Really good Product,This product is just how they said it is.I really like how it fits and it is not very heavy.I recomend it.
5,Good ole Rocker and soft in places,"Back To The Egg is Back To The Roots!, March 4, 2001I rate ""Back To The Egg"" as one of McCartney & Wings best (in my opinion). I rate it with ""Ram"", ""Wildlife"" & McCartney. It's production is raw and gives it a live take feel. If you like some good ole rock, this is a good'n! ..."
4,Paul rocks out!,That says it all. Chris Thomas produces a rockin' McCartney album. It's my favorite Wings album by far.
4,WINGS flying high!,"""Back to the Egg"" contains more great music than any other WINGS collection (bar WINGSPAN). As other reviewers have stated, the vinyl release is a rollercoaster ride of musical style that can be unnerving, but all of the pieces are amazing in their own way. This is some of WINGS best music ever, making it easy to forgive the track layout. Programming this CD to best suit your taste is recommended. Rock fans should select ""Spin it On"", ""Old Siam, Sir"", ""Rockestra Theme"", & ""So Glad to See You Here"". Softer music lovers would prefer ""Getting Closer"", ""We're Open Tonight"", & ""Arrow Through Me"". The remaining pieces are also of varying interest. No matter how you slice it, this is outstanding music, perhaps the best WINGS ever produced. Something great for everyone willing to weed through it."
3,An Underrated Jewel,"This is McCartney in a more disciplined frame of mind than usual, and it makes for some fine listening. ""Baby's Request"" is a true gem, and the inclusion on CD of ""Wonderful Christmastime"" is a happy addition. The songs are all quite different from each other, so keep an open mind throughout."
4,Underrated,"This album is definitely Wings' most underrated album. Other than the two medleys and Spin It On, everything is good. Getting Closer, Arrow Through Me, So Glad To See You Here, Rockestra Theme, and Old Siam Sir are all excellent songs. Denny Laine's Again and Again is a strong contribution from him.I don't have the CD with the bonus tracks, so I don't know how those are, other than Wonderful Christmas Time, which is a Christmas season staple on the radio."
4,Don't believe the bad reviews,"Many Paul fans rank this album at the bottom of the barrel, along with ""Wild Life."" You frequently hear that Back to the Egg is the nadir of his creative output. Not true.There are some clunkers on this album, but there are also some surprisingly great rockers, like Getting Closer and Old Siam Sir (very under-rated), as well as some beautiful patened Paul ballads. This is a much better album than ""McCartney II,"" ""Press to Play"" and others which are inepxlicably regarded as superior to this album.This is far from Paul's greatest work, but it's enjoyable, it rocks, Paul's vocals are awesome and the instrumentals are sharp and envigorating. Even when Paul is slightly off, he is such a genius that his subpar efforts are superior to most of what's out there today."
5,Great CD,I left this review before but here it is again. This CD is more from the Great Sir Paul. Arrived on time.
5,Those were the days....,"As a 16-year-old Beatles fan, I bought this album the week it appeared in stores. It's kind of dated now, but I'll never forget imposing it on my girlfriend on a trip to Six Flags; it sure beat the Bee Gees, her favorite _du jour_! It would do until the Beatles reunion I was sure was around the corner. Nice tunes, nice guitar, great voice, cool artwork, nice concept -- I'm probably stretching, but I give it a five."
4,Excellent,"I've never understood the negativity associated with this album. Paul sings his guts out, the songs are good and rock very well indeed."
2,Egg on his face,"Good God this is a bloody awful album! This was Paul trying to ""punk"" up his image after Goodnight Tonight in 1979 but he fails miserably. The lyrics are awful . His Baby's Request is typical of Macca's love for pseudo-1930's English nostalgia. Arrow Through Me and Denny Laine's patronizing Again and Again and Again (""you don't want to be the little woman..."" - please!) are bore you to the point of suicide. His hiring every rock dinosaur alive in '79 to play on Rockestra is Macca embarking on another huge ego trip And just what the heck is the band looking at on the cover?On the original vinyl album side A was Sunny Side Up and side B was Over Easy -- get it? That seemed to be closest to originality and wit this album ever got. But with the CD version on one disk, even that was lost. Best track - Spin it On. Thank God he got arrested for pot soon after this was released -- after this mess, he desperately needed an image change."
4,Almost Band On The Run,"This is easily one of Paul's best albums. In retrospect, it's sad to say that it was also one of his last really rocking albums as well. Possibly the lone exception is Flaming Pie. Unfortunately, I am of the age to remember this album in its initial release, and to this day, more than 30 years later, I still can't understand why it was a failure. Maybe the public was still in the disco craze, and this gem seemed to slip by. Also, if I recall, it received a lot of unfavorable publicity, saying that the final product was less than what Paul wanted, his own version of a Who-style rock opera. Shame really because this album is loaded with great material. Definately more than worth a look see if you ask me...perhaps not the rock opera masterpiece that Paul originally wanted, but pretty damn good in my book..."
3,Not His Best,"Está claro que ""Bagg to the Egg"" no es de los mejores discos de Wings o Paul McCartney. Se puede escuchar entero y tiene buenas piezas, pero nada que sea espectacular o realmente memorable. Wings estaba culminando su carrera y eso se nota. Lo más destacado, en todo caso, me parece el comienzo, ""Getting Closer"" y ""Rochestra Theme""."
2,McCartney tries too hard,"Paul tried to get a hard, rocking sound. But it sounds too deliberate an attempt. A few good, catchy, ""McCartney"" hooks but all-in-all, not his best solo work. One of his worst, in fact."
4,A TASTY MUSICAL OMELET,"BACK TO THE EGG is a scrambled mix typical of the virtuoso performer and songwriter.McCartney has never pigeonholed himself into one style of music. He explores every branch of the musical tree and has silenced his critics by doing each style in his own inimitable way.EGG has some great moments that overshadow a couple ventures into mediocrity.Highlights for me: ARROW THROUGH ME, a smartly arranged funk tune that's one of my favorite Wings efforts; the pop smoothness of GETTING CLOSER; the star-laden instrumental ROCKESTRA THEME; the two melodic medleys AFTER THE BALL/MILLION MILES and WINTER ROSE/LOVE AWAKE; the driving DAYTIME NIGHTTIME SUFFERING. Even the sometime annoying WONDERFUL CHRISMASTIME is unavoidably infectious.McCartney has been an iconic figure since the Beatles and has earned his place as one of pop's true legends. While not a brilliant album, EGG is a fine example of McCartney's genius."
5,Back to the Egg,"I received fast, courteous service from the seller, and the product was just as it was advertised. Thanks for making my Christmas shopping easier!!"
5,A Very Infectuous Record,"Well, when I first heard this album, I was ecstatic to see Paul still had a hard rock edge after all the interim between the Beatles (i.e. Birthday). This double-album hearkens back to the old notions of hard rock and fuses them with the then-modern licks that Zeppelin and Alice Cooper had set into motion. Much heavier than most of Macca's material, each song on this album GROOVES, at least up until After The Ball (incidentally, an odd but pleasant ballad).A lot of reviewers (not for this album per se, but on reviews for other Wings albums) like to talk smack on Back To The Egg. they say, for instance, that its hard rock efforts fall flat on its face. and I say that's cobbleswattle! this album vyes for the top of the Wings catalogue, and is very nearly their most satisfying musical experience.Its good, if you haven't heard it, but it now!!!"
4,Are Alone In the Universe?,W. Raymond Drake saw a lot of possible visitation of spacemen to earth in the ancient times. He found writings and drawing from many parts of the world that looked to him like they could have only been there because of spacemen from another world. Much of his finding are still a mystery to our modren world.
5,"Good book, lots of pics.",I really enjoyed reading this history on Saab cars. There are plenty of pictures and the chapters are well organized.
5,A Classic Piece of Nostalgia,"As an underprivileged child (who didn't know it), I had been blessed to have been exposed to this book at the neighborhood Head Start. Although I could not read or remember the title, the images, characters and plot stayed with me well into adult hood. As I was randomly scrolling for dolls for my daughter on Amazon.com, this book came up, and I just had to purchase it for her. She fell in love with the book, and asks me to read it to her every night. I do not blame her; I'm sure she finds this piece of literature as alluring and fascinating as I did. The black and white photography is genius and memorable, adding awe to this timeless childhood read."
5,Lovely Book (forget what the PC say),"This is a lovely book as are all of Dare Wright's. Forget what the one-star PC-types say, children understand more than you think and all you have to do is explain to them that spanking is ""something we don't do anymore and this was written a long time ago (1957)."" If they cannot read, just skip that part of the text. Fairy Tales contain more weirdo stuff. You cannot shelter children from literature or what the real world is like forever. They will only rebel and find it anyway, even small ones. I raised three well adjusted daughters so I'm not just speaking out of school."
5,I loved this book when I was a kid!!,"What I remember about all of Dare Wright's books was that reading them made me happy. The Lonely Doll did all the bad stuff I wanted to do but never did, like writing bad things all over the bathroom mirror with lipstick. Even as a five-year-old, I related very strongly to the story of The Lonely Doll, and recall finding some strange comfort in the images, which are all high-quality black-and-white photographs.However, I can't say if the images in this book are developmentally appropriate for pre-K or K-3 readers, nor am I certain whether I would read it with my own children. For those of you who don't know the specifics, the Lonely Doll named Edith misbehaves, and she gets her butt spanked by the authoritative Mr. Bear. He then promises her that he will never, ever leave her. It may not be the kind of message we want to share with our little girls. 'He hits me but then he says he loves me, and he promises that he'll never leave me'."
4,book from the past.,"I purchased this book because I remembered I read it as a young child. I still love the pictures and the characters but I do have to agree with alot of other reiews that this book is not appropriate for children. The story is dark (a child who's left alone with no explaination of why ), spanking is used as a form of punishment, and the idea of strangers taking over a child's welfare is creepy. I love the book for the pictures and the layout. I suggest buying this book but not giving it to a young child."
2,Whew! I'm not the only one...,"When I read this book as a child, one of the messages I got was that even pretty china dolls get spanked (not just us plain brunette children with short noses). Another message was that I should be happy with my family because they didn't threaten to abandon me.As a parent I now wonder what message of ""family"" this book would give adopted children or any children. Children often fear abandonment due to their misbehaviour; why would we want to encourage that?I decided not to keep the copy of ""The Lonely Doll"" that was given to us and I could not in good conscience pass it on to another family.By the way, I find it disturbing that the Hornbook review refers to a ""good spanking"".They are lovely photographs and I liked the cover."
1,disturbing,We received this book as a gift. I like the photo illustration concept but the book content itself is disturbing. There are so many better books out there to spend your money on.
1,Taking this out of my daughter's library,"I found this book and thought the illustrtions were absolutey beautiful -- a true work of artistry. However, I didn't read it through before I bought it. I was reading it to my daughter when I discovered how disturbing the story turns with the spanking scenes. I stopped reading the book and I will take it out of my house."
1,BEWARE,"This is not an appropriate book for children! As a child, I myself found it highly disturbing. Although the pictures are cute, I would never allow my child to read it."
3,This Book Could Help Your Child Develop a Taste for Bondage,"I borrowed this book from the library as a young child numerous times, but I never owned a copy. I recently came across it in a bookstore and was both disappointed in some of the blatant sexism it contains and disturbed by the inappropriateness of the spanking scene. As I reviewed the photo of Edith being spanked (always one of my favorite parts as a child), I felt a little thrill and realized that this scene planted an early seed that led to me developing certain sexual tastes as an adult. I'm not blaming the book, I'm just saying it isn't as innocent as some would argue and I would not share this book with my children. (Do a little research into the author and you'll see that she was a tad creepy.)I also think the spanking scene sends a questionable message to those children whose parents are trying to teach them that no one has the right to use violence against them. Ever."
5,A Fabulous Book!,"I had vaguely remembered these from childhood, when my little girl and I stumbled upon it at the library. To those of you who see this as absuive and sending a negative message--please consider: A) It was written when spanking children was considered perfectly acceptable (and no, I don't condone that, my daughter has NEVER been spanked) and B)my kid found the spanking thing quite amusing and smacked the picture of Mr. Bear to punish him back. In other words: It's a pretty book, with lovely photographs and THAT's what the children enjoy.Oh, yeah, my daughter ADORES the books and her Edith doll that goes with."
5,"After 30 years, this is one book that still makes me smile!","When our first granddaughter was born 4 years ago, I started to look for a copy of The Lonely Doll for her, just as I had read it to her mother. I have searched old bookstores and tried to find a copy, and am just delighted that it has been republished. It is a thoughtful, quiet, lovely book and I enjoyed reading it to them as much as the little ones enjoyed hearing it!"
4,Can be read on different levels but take it for what it is.,"I just read this book with my daughter, actually she read it aloud to me. We enjoyed the photos very much. We laughed, gasped and said ""uh-oh"" a lot. I must admit to finding the spanking scene a bit odd for a children's book but my daughter didn't seem to think anything of it. And no, she has never experienced anything like that herself. Maybe it is because she reads a lot of british children's books i.e Enid Blyton's Famous five series and Roald Dahl books that the darker side of kids lit does not faze her. I came to Amazon to find out what others thought of this book and was not surprised what I found. It all became clear when I learned a little about the author's early life. What a creative way to express her pain. Kids wont see any of those elements and wont care to either, they'll just enjoy the story."
5,Silly Old Things,"This book is a sort of time capsule of childhood in the 50s-60s. We were spanked. Would you ban Oliver Twist? Or Harry Potter? Or ""protect"" your children from all realities of life?Edith is a doll. But she is an adventurous, creative and ultimately honest character. She expresses herself. As in most families of the day, there wasn't a lot of explanation for anything. Things just were. This was long before psychotherapy was en vogue or children had rights. And yet it still speaks truly to children of today. At least to children young enough to know better. Many parents don't seem to get it."
5,History Repeats Itself,"Nightly, my little one wants me to tell her a bedtime story, so as we lay in bed together I try to come up with a sweet little story that will soothe her to sleep. Last night, I couldn't come up with one of my own, when suddenly I remembered The Lonely Doll. I retold the story as I remembered it fondly, and when I was finished she said, ""Mommy, you tell the best stories."" And she soon fell asleep. It was a childhood favorite of mine, and is now a favorite of my daughter's. I couldn't wait to order it for her. Thank You Dare Wright!"
1,A creepy book,"I did read this as a child, and though I could not have articulated the unpleasant feeling it gave me--I never liked it, that sad, vaguely arlarmed, looking doll, or the text. As an adult I find it very creepy. The doll who is so lonely and invites in a domineering father figure. THe bottom-up spanking is the illustration frequently complained about but they all invoke lonliness and passivity for me."
5,The best book of the genre,"Time travel is one of my favorite sci-fi themes, and I've read dozens of books on the topic. Most sci-fi books are like James P. Hogan's hard sci-fi books, full of technology and long discussions between physicists. While There Will Be Time has some tech and some science dialogue, it's really a story about some very human themes like good vs evil, finding your purpose in life, and what obligations the strong have to care for the weak.I read this first as a teenager, and thought about it for years. I found a used copy in my thirties that I've re-read several times, and I'm starting to wear that one out. This is one of those rare books that I know I'll read over and over until my eyes give out."
3,Anderson's version of time travel,"If you read enough Poul Anderson, you'll find similarities amongst his works.""Avatar"" sees a group of people travelling through space, trying to find home.""The Boat of a Million Years"" follows a group of immortals, who start on earth and then head for the stars because they live forever.""There Will Be Time"" tells of a time traveller who influences the future of earth and then, yes!, decides to travel through space because time is only a minor inconvenience.Anderson lays the ground rules for this time novel: Known events can't be changed, time travelers stay in the same place relative to Earth, you can meet your future/past self. And there's the ever-present suggestion of self-created time loops.Good as far as time stories go, but unfortunately not a classic."
4,History for all,"In response to the previous review, Chapter XX speaks of slavery. The reading level appears to be geared toward upper elementary."
1,Very poor quality!,"The assertion that ""This is one of the best thumb tips made on the market today"" is simply NOT true. I was very dissapointed with this plastic thumb tip - poor coloring and it has a very noticeable seam! I went to a local magic shop and purchased a rubber tip with great color and seamless for only $5. Buyer beware!"
2,not a good choice,this camera is great as a toy or for children to practice with. The software is also pretty nice and lets you do quit a bit of editing. the photos though are terrible. usually they ave a blue or brown cast to them and even on a tripod the images blur. not recommended for saving photo memories.
2,Not worth it.,"This had no effect on pet hair. Personally, masking tape wrapped around your hand works better."
1,Awful Recording,"While I do appreciate the performing skill of American Brass Band, I have to say that the quanlity of CD one of the worst I have ever seen. Noise (probably generated at recording process) almost overwhelms the music. There is no way you can possibly appreciate a CD like that. It is (inexpensive), but still not worth it."
4,"Fun with Shifters, Strong alpha females","This was the final book of the Magnus Pack trilliogy. It is necessary to read these books in order to understand the events that are taking place. The main story begins with Sara fighting a pack war that was started by her mother, and finding love in the Magnus Pack. The war comes to a head and climaxes in Here Kitty, Kitty as Angelina falls for a tiger shifter. I have enjoyed the characters through out this series. The women Sara, Miki, and Angelina are truly psychotic and crazy. They grew up together and have been best friends for life. They are flawed, funny and annoying (just like a crazy relative) but endearing. Thank goodness the men in this series have been more on the rational, calm side. This series is a fun light read involving wolf packs, lion prides, tigers and more interacting, fighting wars and finding love."
5,Shelly Laurenston books,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED (HERE KITTY, KITTY, PACK CHALLENGE AND GO FETCH) THIS TRIO AND ALL THE REST OF HER SHIFTER SERIES BOOKS. THE AUTHOR HAS AN AWESOME SENSE OF HUMOR THAT CONSTANTLY IS MAKING ME LAUGH, PLUS THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LOVEABLE. THEY ROCK CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE JUST LIKE THEM."
4,A Laugh-out-loud IR paranormal story,"I liked this story a lot. It is a good ending to the three best friends (Sara, Miki and Angelina). I also like Shelly Laurenston's tone when writing, she's one sharp, sarcastic writer.I am not in love with it because I think the brand name dropping was oversold a bit too much. Ferragamo this, Louis Vuitton that, Gucci on speed dial...gag me with a spoon. *rolls eyes*What I did like a lot was that hillbilly and his kin. They tickled my toes seriously. Between their ""Naw""s and antics, they made this story very entertaining. (I like Southern boys, they make my Yankee heart melt!)Angelina...grew on me. But she wasn't so bad. Her and Miki's antics at times were cute but a little childish. Both are human for goodness sakes but there are ready to take on shifters and act all hardcore bad-ss.However, overlooking those concerns, the story is smooth and very likeable. I can't choose if I liked ""Go Fetch"" or ""Here Kitty , Kitty"" more"
2,A Box Within a Box,"This is a bit of a slog because it really is a parody within a parody wrapped in a mystery with Inspector Morse checking in. The mystery is compelling, but little else is in this Dexter work."
5,Inspector Morse is a very special detective,Typically wonderful Colin Dexter story. Complex plot line with a minimal number of red herrings. Well worth the read and investment of time.
1,gone!,"I was half way through this book when it suddenly disappeared from my Kindle. Deleting, downloading again did not help. Money was returned, but I still don't know what happens next."
5,Cute - I used them to decorate a cake.,"I used these to decorate my boyfriend's birthday cake. I have to admit, they were a bigger hit than my cake! lol!"
2,Not meant to be played with...AT ALL!,"My son got these for his 3rd birthday from his Grandma. He absolutely loves Jack but these really aren't ""toys"". After only a few hours of play he kept popping Jack's head off. A few days later, he kept doing the same thing. We couldn't get Jack's head to stay on, so, into the trash he went. Then he moved onto Sally. Taking her arms off over and over. No matter how hard we tried we couldn't get them back on! So she went into the trash as well. Lock, Shock and Barrell are VERY small. Don't even let these near your kid if he/she has a habit of putting items in their mouth. Oogie has to weigh about a pound himself so if he drops onto your/your child's foot, be prepared for some pain :P I don't have any complaints about Zero. If you're looking to collect NBC items or as I saw in other reviews, use as cake toppers, they're great. The poor quality prevents them from being a good play set."
5,Michael Mann is a genius.,'The Insider' is certainly one of the best films of 1999. There is not another director working today who can match Michael Mann's eye for detail. Example: Little Debbie wrappers only used in Louiville. He rules.
3,Could have been better,"This movie, despite the awesome performance by Al Pacino, could have been better. I wasn't aware until nearly the end that it was based on a true story. It had it's good moments - it's good dialogue - but in the end the parts didn't all come together..."
5,Woah,"i could hardly believe how excellent this film was when I saw it. I already knew the story that it's based on, and although some things were slightly changed, its for the better.Old Al does a fine job here, hes not the typical yelling loud character he usually is and carries the role perfectly. Russel Crowe's face is also 100% neccisary in the movie.Michael Mann's direction is also pure genious. Every scene is done perfectly.You won't be dissapointed."
3,Biased but enjoyable,"The Insider is entertaining and boasts a great Pacino performance but suffers from overlenghth and a bias. The story is very interesting, but I find it hard to believe some of the actions credited to the allegedly evil tobacco companies. Another lowpoint is the soundtrack (irritating and distracting), and the portrayal of Wigand's wife. I am sick of how poor movies portray women. Still, the movie was somewhat suspenseful and interesting and had good performances."
4,excellent and a half,"The Insider would have worked as a plot-driven film. Jeff Weigand has his family and career destroyed when he revelas corperate dirt on big tabacco.But what makes the film so incredible is that it is in fact charactor driven, not just moved ahead by story. The cerebral, family oritented yet emotional Wiegand-Russel Crowe-is contrasted with the hip, radical 60 Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pachino.Both charactors dig their heals into their positions, and watcing these two passionate but extremely bright guys in give and take is simply incredible to watch.The acting is incredible. Both men want, often, conflicting things--Wiegand some shred of privacy and protection, Bergman his story and all he needs to know to protect Wiegand.The subtance of the tobacco litigation is interesting. But the drives of both men--and how smartly this is discussed-is what makes the Insider a cut above most whistle blower movies."
5,Fantastic,The Insider is a first rate movie with great performances from Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. The movie is about the man who blew the whistle on the Tobacco industry. It makes for a gripping tale in which justice prevails. It most definitely features as one of my personal favorites. I generaly only dont't watch movies a second time but this one has had repeated viewings.
5,Powerful,A gripping film depicting the terrible cost paid by those who dare to expose the underhanded tactics perpetrated by the tobacco industry. Pacino and Crowe are excellent in the leading roles. This is one of Pacino's best performances. A film well-worth seeing.
2,"Good point, great acting but...way way too long","I loved this movie........at least I thought I would love this movie. It started out with lots of intensity and kept me interested for the first hour and half, but after a while I was like...""Okay"", let's get to the point. I understand the whole point of telling the whole story and getting all the points across, but when you're wanting a movie to end that's not good. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it was one of the best last year, I just thought it was horrible."
1,slow and painful,Perhaps the DVD is ok as you could fast forward but I'd think twice about purchasing such a slow film. I thought the movie had finished 3 or 4 times before it actually did. Mea culpa!
1,The Outsider..and leave it there.,"Boring, slow, and boring. Even watching the actual 60 Minutes pieces on this story was more entertaining."
4,"A wonderful movie, Pacino and Crowe are great","I had heard about this movie when I saw the academy awards and wanted to see it. But my friend said she was watching it and her husband fell asleep. I thought it was nominated for a lot of awards it can't be that bad. So I watched it and i really enjoyed it, it seemed to be a bit lengthy but it had a good story supported by great actors."
5,An excellent movie!,"The Insider is a powerful look into the tobacco indestry, and how they lied about the nicitene. Both Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are fantastic in the film. This movie is for anyone who enjoys a deep look into a very contraversal subject."
4,"Lengthy, but with healthy intentions","A slightly overlengthed film hailed for Russell Crowe's performance should actually be hailed for a few other things; first off, both Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer are magnificent here. Secondly, the cinematography is breaktaking and beautiful, with its vivid use of color, high contrast levels, and focus-changing shots within a small depth of field, perfectly matching the harmonic vocals that complement the movie's poignant score. Lastly, the film's conclusion, with the plot's full Sixty Minutes interview actually airing on television to audiences everywhere with the anti-Tobacco Industry interview, more than makes up for the film's overlength (a trend in 1999, with ""The Green Mile"" and ""Magnolia"" each lasting over three hours); the ending is addictively gratifying."
5,Russell Crowe steals this show!,Can you imagine a scientist standing up against the tobacco industry? Can you imagine this scientist recorded a segment on 60 minutes and that 60 minutes refused to air the program because of political pressure? This really happened. Russell Crowe is fascinating in this study of a man caught between morality and saving him self and his family from psychological torture. Al Pacino plays the producer who ultimately gets the scientists testimony heard after going to the New York Times with the story. This is a story that every one can relate to. It is gripping. Crowe should have won an academy award for his performance.
4,Money does not always win.,"This is a true story of a man who decided to tell the world what the major tobacco companies knew about the dangers of their product. Jeffrey Wigand was a scientist employed in research for a tobacco firm. Soon after he was fired Wigand came into contact with a producer for 60 Minutes who worked closely with journalist Mike Wallace. Bergman, the producer, arranged for Wigand to be interviewed by Wallace for a 60 Minutes expose on the cigarette industry, though Wigand was still bound by a confidentiality agreement not to discuss his employment with the company. Despite Wigand's willingness to talk, CBS pulled his interview from at the last minute afterthe tobacco company threatened a multi-billion dollar lawsuit. The staff of 60 Minutes and CBS News were soon in an internal struggle over the killing of the stor. Even though Wigand's full story did not see the light of day, he found himself the subject of lawsuits and a smear campaign."
2,Who is the editor?!?!,"Ok, this movie is about 1.5 hours longer than it should have been... Did they forget to hire an editor?It starts out ok, but the whole thing just kinda strains at the end, until it gets to be like a neverending broken record. The make up jobs are weird as well. It seems like Russell Crowe never fully underwent his ""aging"" transformation. Yeah, he has on a grey wig, but his face is that of a relatively young person. Besides that, Al Pacino, who is like 15 years older than him in real life, looks 20 years younger than Crowe in the movie.It's an OK movie, but nothing special... Tip: have that fast forward button nearby, it will save u a headache."
2,what's the big deal?,"i found this to be one of the most boring films of 1999. russell crowe, as usual, completely eclipses everyone else who's onscreen at the same time, but al pacino just screams and claws at the scenery for 2 hours. it's always great to see christopher plummer and he's wonderfully low-key, but the movie overall is a yawner....i just don't see what everyone was so excited about."
3,Suprisingly grate,I expected this movie to be a bunch of bussiness and interviews nothing special. But this moviw was grate. And it is strange and a little sad seeing what this man had to go threw with his story. I mean this is a true story and I dont actually usually like true stories they are about somebody there lifes are boring and then they think they can turn it in to a movie and it will be incheresting I dont think so. But this one was and I say this is a must see movie.
3,i am disappointed,"i am really disappointed while watching this movie. I dont know, maybe my expectations were high. But i got bored. The movie is unnecessarily long and the tempo is always low. Al pacino is good but russell is not. The story is interesting. It shows the direction of press towards social problems. I prefer not to watch that movie but...its ok..at least it worths to see al pacino on screen."
5,Saved My Life,"Dear reader, I was a 5 packs a day man when the insider moved my insides and thus forced a desion from within my soul barren to quit this awful fart inhalation. Well I didn't quit but I changed from a Brown and Williamson product to a Philip Morris product and I now smoke the great Marlboro Reds(recommend by me).But in our hazen discovery of the truth lest us not neglect our shakeperian duty to rise and fall like an empire of sand, liquid sand. dissolving me and you and the constipation and lts us have our deeply desired laxative, yes dear reader, a laxative is what THE INSIDER reminded me of and it is the best laxative of 1999. But crowe has acne, but I dug venora you know."
2,Good story but Over Rated!,"I am not saying that this is a bad movie or bad story... not at all. But here are the disappointments that might hit you:1. One of things that might disappoint the audience is that it cannot be easily swallowed after Russel's great movie ""Gladiator"". 2. Second when you say Al Pacino, we remember his greatests ""Heat"" or ""Devil's Advocate"". So this movie does not easily fit with many of his great movies.So the success of this movie is no more determined by the actors past successful history, but only if the story is good or not. And yes the story was good and had its certain type of suspense but it gets in a frame that we all knew about this story and now it has got out.In other words, we always believed that smoking cigarettes is an addiction. No this film told us why and how. So it's not new, but now it is out.I see that this type of story needed not such expensive great actors except to attract more audience!"
1,Meretricious Dreck,"The only impressive thing about this overblown and self-important film was that the director was able to get it released with easily an hour of totally disposable footage and scenes included. That must have taken some doing. Otherwise, it is totally undistinguished: hackneyed, false, and tasteless."
2,Not worth the price of a DVD,I thought this was ok for a rental but not for something i would spend 25.00 on. I was disapointed in all the whispering. I know it is a movie about secrets but you could barely understand them at times. Reminds me of Murder at 1600.
1,"Great movie, ruined by touchstone DVD politics..","Touchstone has decided to force you to watch two trailers EVERY SINGLE TIME you insert the disc in your player. The only function allowed is power off and eject. Don't get me wrong the movie is very good, but the DVD execution is terrible. If I had known this, I would never have bought it."
2,Could have been better.,"'The Insider' could have been a much better movie than it actually turned out to be. One of the main problems with the film is we don't know anything about the Russel Crow's character or his family. They were poorly developed and that really hurts the movie. We don't know why Jeff has the emotional problems he has or why his wife seems like she is going to vomit in every other scene.What is also really annoying is how the 'The Insider' was filmed.Do we really need to see extreme close-ups of the characters' faces from five different angles? What purpose does this type of directing serve? Al Pacino did a fine job as always, but even he couldn't save this mess."
2,Pretty much a waste of time,"The story itself, which is based on real events, is interesting but the filmmakers made it into a weak feature film. There is too much unnecessary information and the ""60 minutes"" peoples' portrayal is too harsh. Some scenes are repeated during the film and the overall dialogue can [at times] put you to sleep.I give this film two stars instead of one because of Russel Crowe's superb acting."
4,my review,"This is a true story about an ex-Tobacco executive who is cohersed into revealing secrets from his job. The Tobacco company where he used to work has made his life, as well as his family's a living hell. He fights back.This is a very gripping movie. The acting is done exceptionally well by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, as well as Christopher Plummer. The plot is very well adapted, making it very easy to watch.Good movie, very good acting. A must see."
4,Great Movie!!!,"This was recommended to me by a quit smoking group. I highly recommend this to smokers/non-smokers alike. If I had known about this, I would have never started smoking. 4 ****!!!"
4,Hoping to see More Objective movies like this,"I think that the war against Nicotine is not an easy one to engage in.This film is very interesting and touches the life of an individual who had to go through hell to do the moral thing.Both Pacino and Crowe did a good job. However, the movie was VERY slow paced; and could have possibly been covered in half the time.Good point nonetheless. I am a Nicotine Addict by the way, and I have been living without Nicotine for the last 4 months."
3,Good But Not Best Picture,"The Insider was pretty good considering its 2hr and 35min run. It's most insightful on tobacco subjects and the acting well, the acting was great. The only thing that I thought was wrong with the acting was Al Pacino but then, I'm not really a Pacino fan. It just seems to me that he was trying way too hard with all that yelling and that dominating tone of his. Now, on the other hand, Russell Crowe was excellent. I know that he's one of the most greatest actors of now. He didn't get what he deserved and it's a shame because he should of.Over all, The Insider was good. To me it really wasn't a thriller. It lacked suspense but all the drama that you need is in here and that should not be missed."
5,You Have To See It More Than Once...,"...to know what the movie is really about, and even then I'm not sure I caught everything. There were some great movies released in 1999, but as far as what movie had the most balls, for me it's a toss-up between Michael Mann's meticulously crafted ""The Insider"" and ""South Park"". Personally, I see this movie as an indictment of all corporations, be it Big Tobacco or the CBS Television Network. It's up to strong-minded individuals like the Al Pacino character to keep these bastards in check."
4,Not that you need another opinion....,"...but I enjoyed this film enough to write about it. The things I liked most about the film were the characters, and the tension. Al Pacino (as Lowell Berghman) and Russell Crowe (as Jeffery Wigand) were terrific. There protrayals were heartfelt and believeable. The woman who played Wigand's wife was weak, but in some sense she was good because you started to hate her for her lack of virtue. As for the tension, throughout nearly the entire film there is this palpable feeling that someone is going to be knocked off, or something is going to pop onto the screen to make you jump. The odd thing is that very little actually happens in the film (you could probably summarize it in 10 sentences), but you're gripped all the way through. My only complaint is that it was a bit too long. After 2:30+ it starts to get a little dull, and the tension isn't enough to keep you glued to the seat. Nonetheless this film is very much worth it."
4,Excellent reference guide for quilt block patterns.,I found this encyclopdia to be an excellent reference guide for different quilt blocks. I was able to identify several antiques quilts that are variations of well known blocks. I recommend this book!
1,Not What I Expected,"This books has loads of information, but it is in black and white and the fonts make it difficult to hold one's attention. I would not purchase this again."
3,"Wonderful book, if it were only all there...","I was thrilled to find this book, but extremely dissapointed to find that more than a half dozen pages were missing. Tried ordering another, but the same was true for the second purchase."
3,Encyclopedia of Pieced Quilt Patterns,"This book only shows how to identify the type of block and known names. It does not tell any history, except where the name came from (like a publication). I was hoping this would be about the folklore associated with the block names (like what Kansas Troubles and Bachelor's Puzzle mean). Although I know the stories collected about quilt blocks would be purely speculation, it would be fun to read a book about collected histories."
5,"The ""Bible"" for all Quilter's","This is definately the best best best quilting book I have ever invested in. If you're looking for the history and outline of a quilting block, this detailed and incredible book will almost certainly have it. Set out in a logical manner, this book is a must-have for anybody interested in tracking the origins and names of antique and vintage patterns as well as newer creations. AAA+++"
5,Winged Pirate Ships and The Art of Far Seeing!!!,"Not really an audiobook, this full fledged RADIO PLAY brings to life an amazing cast of characters. Complete with talanted voice actors and a producer who truly understands the art of telling a story through sound, this is a grand adventure of the mind. Imagine huge sky galleons doing mid air battle with cargo holds of winged sheep. Have a bad day at Dragon's Breath along with Little Frieda, she of the piggy tales and huge Havana cigars. Learn the Art of Far Seeing from that old caretaker, Far Seeing Art. Bargin with the Lords of Death along side the Marquis of Carumbas. Or just nestle back into a Overstuffed Green Velvet chair and just let your mind take off. I could not recomend this enough!"
3,Las luces de septiembre,"Although this novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon was intended for a younger audience, the simple intrigue and characters can also interest older readers. The language is vivid and, although there is not much actual character development, the ""personajes"" are clear and fitting for the plot."
4,Sacred!,"Two ladies with voice- contrast show usa dark pop- collection with interestingsounds. ""Run silent"", ""Dirty mind"",""Sacred heart"", ""You made me come to this""and the Bob Marley- classic ""Could you beloved?"" are the best ones on thiswell- made collection."
4,Truly Remarkable,"This kind of music is not found in a lot of music these days. The way they sing, truly remarkable."
1,Not worth my $.99,"If you have ever heard the version by Shakespear's Sister, you'd realize how much injustice the version brought to the song. Complete thumbs down!"
1,Boring!,The film has Skinner (Mel Gibson) as a FBI agent sent to a low life hotel to investigate the death of an artist named Izzy (Tim Roth.) Everyone thinks that it was just suicied. But old Skinner knows better and through some searching comes up with his own idea. The film also has Tom-Tom (Jeremy Davies)who's best friend was Izzy as the main suspect. But the film goes and does nothing but burn up two hours. You can even see Mel yawning on screen.It is the one Mel Gibson film we should like to forget. Grade:D-
1,why isn't there a Zero rating on the scale?,"This is one of those movies that is ""artistic"" because someone was trying really really really hard to make it that way. People say that art is in the eye of the beholder and I have typically felt that the so-called ""artistic"" movies try so hard to be ""artistic"" that they become... In this case, I am the beholder and I say that this movie is garbage, even for Mel Gibson, who is a wonderful actor. I feel the same way about this movie as I did about Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver. This movie was... The plot was dumb. The ending was dumb. The characters and acting were ridiculous and .... well I dunno! There are so many bad things I could say about this movie but I don't want to waste anymore of my time. I have other things I could be doing. I just felt the need to print my very very negative review."
1,not up to standards,"This book is a low-grade rewrite of dream team, which is a copy of one flew over the cuckoos nest, witch if a rip off of Don Quixote. So we see that everything is a copy of some classic, and as time progresses, the copies get worse, like running Shakespeare through a Xerox machine so the copies get more and more degraded each time.The music isn't even up to par with u2's standasrds. I think that 'passengers' is a better soundtrack like miss Sarajevo which is really a monotonous song, but bono and the lads breath live and power into what would normally be a sub-B side song. But satellite of love isn't up to snuff there are better versions of this song.An odd film to be sure but are crazy people really that virtupus, and do they really see things saner than we do? We should get real with thementally ill abnd increase funding and nor glamorizeing a disease."
5,BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HOLLYWOOD,"Only Wenders could have done it: shoot a film in Hollywood that is 100% non-Hollywood. And that is the best part of it! Even Mel Gibson plays a different role, perhaps one of his best - not a super hero, but someone with a human face, a human story. The music is fantastic, the story is well told. Hate to discuss the events, in case you still have not seen the film. If you are looking for something different than the usual senseless blockbuster evening entertainment with pop corn - see this movie, and you will never forget it..."
2,the hotel you dont want to stay at,"This review is for anyone who, like me saw the trailer and said to them selves ""wow that looks like a really cool detective movie"", well its not a detective movie, Mel Gibson is in it as a detective this much is true but his character take a black seat in this picture, wandering in and out of the story line at his will. The real story is about is about two of the crazy people that are staying at this hotel flirting with each other.Milla Jovovich plays her underwritten part well with lots of subtel moments I'm sure people wont pick up on straight away,...Tom Tom character is mentally retarded so its really hard to work out his reasonings and motivation...."
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi-star cast (including a top-notch soundtrack by U2), the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations, with great performances lost in a bad script. It's just a wanna-be art movie, and nothing else."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK BONO!,"if your into romanticizing junkies and insanity, you love this pseudo-intellectual pretentious piece of garbage. Even a Bud Cort cameo couldn't save this trash. Bono must think he's some sort of prodigal son spreading the word of Mother Truth to us close-minded peon earthlings. Get over yourself. U 2 are just another brick in the wall."
3,A minor film if you think we are talking of Wenders!,"This is to my mind a very moving film with some gags here and there but nothing else. Considering the artistic stature of Wenders, you feel he is in debt with the viewer.If not consider as a huge barroque comedy. Fellini in USA, with characters completely out of their mind and the situation may be seen under this approach but no more.Jimmy Smits , Mel Gibson and Jeremy Davis are outstanding and Milla Jovovich too, but I insist it is a minor film of a major director."
4,Really good film,"I saw a review that said this film was boring. I just wanted to say that this movie is anything but that. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. He/ She must be used to watching gun-packed, blood filled movies because this has great cinemetography and great acting with an excellent story. Just my 2 cents."
2,Muddy Waters,"Appearently, the classic observation that German poets muddy the waters to make them appear deep applies to film directors as well. Basicly a silly movie for those who fancy themselves sophisticated intellectuals in need of their periodic euro-film-fix. It wasn't even all that good as such -- If Wenders had set it in Friedrichshain and in German rather than English it might have worked.Wenders, Gibson and the others involved have done better work in the past and hopefully will again."
1,A book to be avoided unless you are a sanctimonius humbug,"I had it as a text book in my high school and hated it. I had to locate this book today to explain to my 9 year old how we always dont get to read interesting books, more so for class assignments. I know any number of kids who get turned off by Dickens just because they had a tyrannical teacher stuff it down, rather up their brainstems in junior high school. One is asked to read a book in so called dear time, got to read it and follow the party line to get the grades and move on. If you want to teach your child how to read for pleasure, this is not the book to start with."
3,OK....,"Nothing bad, nothing specially good...I have used for 1 month and not found anything changed. I don't think my skin and hair have been better doramatically. It still keep OK condition."
2,Thought it would filter smelly water...I was wrong,"I am guessing this would work perfectly with heavily chlorinated water, such as city water because it definitely did NOT help filter any of the sulfur smell from my well water. It also did not filter any of the iron oxides because after a month the white color where the water comes out is now orange. Also immediately after I put it in the silver holder where the actual shower head fits in broke, it's plastic which seems stupid considering it is a hand held shower head which would cause you to remove it multiple times through out it's shower head life....wouldn't you want that material to be durable???? Not a good buy for me, I was very displeased with this item, if your product states it would help with sulfur and iron then you better make sure thats what it does...."
3,Great water,"I used this product for about a year and a half. I really liked the feel of the filtered water and it felt great on my hair and skin. The pressure and spread of the water is great.The problem with this shower head is that it is just not very sturdy. After a year or so of use, I went to adjust the tilt and the part where the hose attaches to the head snapped in half, leaving a hose spraying water directly at my ceiling and a gigantic mess.I really did like this product and I am considering purchasing it again since it is relatively cheap.I had to replace the filters about every 3-4 months."
3,If I had known how cheap the holding bracket was would have bought something else,"I have no complaints about the showerhead, but after about two weeks the cheap plastic piece that holds the shower head just broke off. If I had known how cheaply made some of the parts were I probably would have gotten something more expensive. If you are handy and know about parts though you could probably just be prepared and buy a nicer bracket and use this just fine.one update, new market naturals does have nice and efficient customer service. I contacted them just hoping to find out how to get another bracket and they immediately said they would ship one without asking for a receipt or anything and said they would add me to their warranty list without having to send anything in"
2,device holding the handheld shower broke,"Unfortunately, the device allowing the handheld shower rotation broke (it was made of plastic instead of metal), after just a month and half of use. In the meantime, I am ordering a new one because I like the shower's features. Hopefully the second one will be sturdier."
2,"It worked fine, then broke","I had no problem with this item while using it. The white plastic that the filter is made of is very weak. As I was unscrewing the hose from the plastic wand, the bottom screw part wore down and now the hose will not stay attached. Be careful when screwing/unscrewing because the plastic wears down very easily. The product becomes defective afterwards."
2,Great Shower Head UNTIL IT BREAKS,"I love this shower head! My skin and hair feel better, and I am less itchy and dry. No chlorine smell anymore. The problem is that after the one year warranty expires the plastic parts crack/ break off so that you may no longer be able to use it. It is very cheaply made. Three separate pieces have already broken in less than 18 months."
3,I liked it when it was new,"I liked this shower head when it was new. My problem is when it came time to change the filter, I couldn't get the filter out of the shower head. I have looked everywhere online and even contacted the seller to try to find out how to change the fiter. Nobody contacted me and I am not able to get the old filter out and I'm afraid it I use a pliers, I will break it. Not very user friendly!"
4,I found the solution to the height and shower arm issues...,"The filter works great to soften my hard AZ water and my dry skin problem is almost gone after only a week of use. The 2 spray settings are nice and have good pressure when you have it set to spray or pulsating massage. However, the pressure is pretty weak on the combo setting (half spray/half massage). The combo setting would be perfect if it only had more pressure! I also combined this shower head withShowerBreeze w/ 6' Hose Water Jet Dental Irrigatorand when combined the spray angle was much too high (even without the showerbreeze I think the angle would be too high and I'm 6'3""). Also, as others have mentioned the shower arm isn't great but I found the perfect solution to both problems with thisMommy's Helper Safer Grip Portable Shower Arm. It allows me to place the shower head at any height and is very stable."
2,broke down after first use,"I was really impressed with the reviews I had read and decided to give it a try. Note: I'm a first time user so I read the instructions very carefully. Unfortunately, after using it for the first time (and it hurts....really hurts...makes me wonder if it might be worth just going to have it all waxed off instead), the thing broke down...pretty much stopped working. very disappointing."
4,great value for the money,"I have used Epilady products for 18 years, but have always winced at the expense of the products (in all fairness, my first Epilady, which cost over $100, lasted 10 years). The Norelco product works just as well and was less than half the cost of the equivalent Epilady. I'm glad to see there's some competition in this marketplace!"
5,Norelco HP2843 Satinelle Epilator,It's the best epilator I've ever tried.The result really lasts about 3 weeks
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this product. It barely pulled hairs on my legs. I have been using an epilady for years, so I didn't have much hair to pull. Even when it was ""on its last leg"" it pulled more hairs then the Satinelle Epilator. I sent this product back."
3,Mixed feelings...,"This is my first introduction to an epilator and I have mixed feelings about this one. It seems like some of the hairs just get cut off and it feels like your legs would feel two days afer shaving kind of thing. I've only used it twice so I'm not sure if I'm not doing it right or if the product is worthless. It's pretty cheap so I think it's worth a try, especially if it's your first time."
4,Philips Norelco HP2843 Satinelle Epilator,"Well... I expected miracles from the product, which I guess is unreasonable. I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it. I will give some advice though. The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!! That being said, subsequent uses are far less painful. I was prepared from the reviews of others that the Epilator does not remove every hair the way shaving does. I cannot stress this enough. You need to go over the surface multiple times. Also, this skin irritation isn't so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating. I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up. All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it. You do need to allow extra time, but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower. I've only been using it for a month or so. So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment."
1,Norelco HP2843 Epilator,"This was a terrible product. I got little sores everywhere I used it. believe me, I will only use it once. Wish I had my money back."
3,product is okay,I read from other people they didn't have to shave for weeks but Ifind to stay smooth I need it once a week. This is my firstepilator so maybe with time it will be different.
5,I can't believe I waited this long to try an epilator!,"This product is awesome. It is definitely more painful than shaving at first, however, after a week of using this product, I can go several days without epilating, and I used to have to shave my legs everyday to keep the stubble at bay. It is a little time consuming until you've completely transitioned, but it's worth it. And I'm going to save a ton of $$ on shaving cream and I feel really good about not having to discard the metal cans they come in!"
4,great product!,"Ive been using this for nearly 7 years now, never an issue and easy to operate. the parts can be removed and i've even washed them in water, no corrosion whatsoever."
4,I like this very much!,"I have used epilators for years. Its not painful as some expressed, but the usual pinch when you start off. Its very efficient and easy to clean. I hope it lasts me a long time. The last one I got was also a phillips one from UK.I am not giving it 5 stars as I dont know its longevity and havent tried the shaver part of it."
4,Good item,This is a good item when compared with its price. Generally I am satisfied with its performance but I want to mention a con. It does not clean small ones. Overall it is worthy to buy.
4,Catchy little band...,"o.k. I'll freely admit that I picked up this CD cause I am a big fan of Lovecraft and I knew that this band was just as into the old gentleman from Providence. I must say that even without the obvious Lovecraft refrences this cd would be well worth the money. Each track has an infectious surf-punk energy all of its own. Since this was the soundtrack for a never (?) released B sci-fi flick the irrevrence that the band carries is very welcome considering the inspiration for a good chunk of the songs on this disc. Personal faves on this would be ""20 Minutes of Oxygen,"" ""The Innsmouth Look (he made love to the fishies),"" and ""The Math Song."" So if you are a fan of the whole Lovecraft/Cthulhu Mythos thing, this CD is well worth picking up. If you like songs that are fun, carefree and a little funny, take a listen to the downloads to make your decision."
1,google divineindustries,"Discovered The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets by accident via some soundtracks on a game preview at by kerberos-productions, like the music but disappointed in Amazon. Placed my original order for Spaceship Zero and Cthulhu Strikes Back on 5-14-06 and still don't have either as of 7-1-06."
5,An amazing CD,"I first heard mention of the Thickets on an Internet newsgroup. I thought it was a joke. Who the hell would make a rock band that pays ribute to HP Lovecraft? Napster was still around then so I downloaded some of their songs and was floored. I then promptly bought every CD of theirs I could. They are that good. The Thickets produce these great, clever, catchy pop punk tunes that remind me of the Smithereens in their heyday. The latest CD is the best one yet. Its polished, tight, and addictive. A week doesnt go by where I don't play this CD. Buy it. Its that good."
4,A solid album!,"More than just a novelty act, The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets have produced an excellent album in Spaceship Zero. Even if the movie never makes an appearance, this is a great concept album, with some cool multi-media extras. Definitely worth a listen!"
3,Educational but hard reading,"This book gives insight into how plans fail. If you are involved in any field in which plans are made and then implemented, be they in any of the engineering disciplines or in any field of human activity, then there is something to be learned from this book.But the writing is such that you will have to expend energy to extract the message from the text. The author apparently wanted to show off his vocabulary and 'erudition', so it is not an easy read.Educational but not suited for light or relaxed reading."
2,Cure for Insomnia!!,"Don't let the interesting cover fool you. Unless you're a complete nerd, you won't enjoy this book. It will however put you right to sleep within 10 minutes.Even with an engineering degree, I found this book to be rather dull."
2,The Evolution of Useful Things,The point of the author could be made in 1/2 the pages. The detail and repeated points particularly regarding silverware is overkill and makes it difficult not to abandon the boring book.
3,"Interesting, but thankfully it's a short book","I read this book based on a recommendation from another book that ranked the top 100 business books. After completing it, I did learn a lot more about the engineering profession and I do have a lot of respect for them now. But the book did repeat it's examples a bit too much and could have been an even shorter. Again, some great examples of real life problems dealing with engineering, but I'm not sure it's worth your time to read."
2,Mediocre at best.,"The author took 232 pages to state what could have been said in 23 pages. He uses nursery rhymes and Greek mythology to ""explain"" the publics expectation that some machines and structures fail!?! He would have been better served going into more details of the few cases he revisits repeatedly. As a working engineer, I found his explanations of how complex systems should be developed very off base. What happened to incremental design improvements, testing, instrumentation, quality control, and design reviews?"
3,Too much substance for a very little product,"This book left me a little dissapointed, Petroski had a full tank of gas and only drove around the block. His use of countless examples over does his simpil thisis, that mistakes happen. ""To Engineer Is Human,"" should have been a great chapter, but not a book. The book does have a great flow to it. Petroski wrights in a very easy, simple, entertaining way. The dissapointment of Petroski is that he fails on subject, which should not have happened from a Civil Engineering professor at duke."
1,Platitudes are All You Will Get,"I usually love books that look at the greater meanings in the evolution of engineering/science etc. But this book is completely void of details on why things went wrong. I kept waiting for interesting insights into engineering failures, but all I got was platitudes. And like the other reviewer said, it put me to sleep. If you want to read a book on the role of failure in successful design, look elsewhere."
2,Low Quality,"I bought this for my son, who has bad asthma at times. I thought I could use it to listen to his lungs, but the quality is very bad.The diaphragm is plastic, and I really have to strain my ears to hear normal breath sounds, let alone crackles or wheezing.Upon recieving it, I found that one of the tubes was bent from sitting in the box for too long. It is irreversible.Although the stethoscope looks all right and works realtively well, I don't recommed buying it just because it's cheap."
3,Not a bad collection,"This is CD includes songs from three of Elvis' early 1960's movies: Flaming Star, Wild in the Country, and Follow That Dream. No soundtrack album was released for any of the movies, however EPs were released for Flaming Star and Follow That Dream and the song Wild In the Country and Lonely Man were released on singles. Flaming Star and Follow That Dream were top 20 hits in the US, reaching 14 and 15 on the Billboard singles chart, while Wild In The Country peaked at 26 and Lonely Man at 32. This is a pretty good collection and a good example of early 60's pop-rock. Not Elvis' best work from the period, but it is not bad."
3,"OK, not great","I'm a huge fan of comedy. When I'm asked what my favorite thing to do is, my answer is to laugh. Life can get so frustrating and the only thing that gets me through sometimes is my ability to look at the insanity of it all and laugh about it.I still remember the first time my husband and I saw Gabriel Iglesias (a.k.a. Fluffy) on Comedy Central. His jokes about run-ins with the police made me laugh hysterically, which made my night. Plus, his laugh is infectious.When I first saw a commercial for Gabriel Iglesias: Stand-Up Revolution, I knew I had to see it. Hearing him talk about his friends all the time definitely made me eager to put a face with the name. While I didn't laugh quite as much as I do when Fluffy is on stage, his friends are pretty funny. I enjoyed this DVD and am glad to have it in my collection."
1,Lmgrubbs,"This was not funny at all, I love Gabriel but his friends are not funny! I didn't enjoy it at all"
4,Thought it was only Gabriel,i thought it was good but i wish it was only Gabriel. if you like his style only you'll be a little let down but it was still good considering.
5,hillarious,"I'm so glad that fluffy has his own show, i did not know that he had his own show i thought that this was another special. even though fluffy did not do many jokes his friends were funny. i do hope that he gets another season. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
5,Hilarious!,"Gabriel is hilarious and his friends is a lot of fun! The only bad side of buying this movie is that I live in Norway, and then it doesnt work on our dvd players without installing something."
2,Worth a look at dicount prices,"Certainly not one of Tony's best efforts. Much of the script is laughable, but the story line is better than comparable low budget films from this period.You know the plot. Ancient Egyptian Princess and Priest fall in love, break the rules, get burried alive only to be resurected when archeologists find the un-marked tomb. Like the original Karlof, this mummy looks pretty much normal once the bandages come off.I can't give this one more than 2 stars, but it still has a spot in my movie cabinet!"
4,The Mummy Lives as Tony Curtis!,This is not the worst mummy movie ever made. Tony Curtis plays the mummyand I think he saves the movie! The girl is pretty but boring and thedoctor who tries to save her is even more boring. The story is quitegood if you like a good mystery and has enough killings to keep youinterested. I've seen worse! much worse! good little mummy movie!
2,Had SO much potential....,"I tried really hard to like this book. The first couple of chapters were really promising, but then the author suddenly lost track of where she was going. Stilted broken part-way descriptive sentences. No serious romance going on. I really didn't care if they ended up together. I suggest Karen Marie Moning for really great time travel romance, or for the serious time travel enthusiast - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Both authors have never written a dud. This was definitely a dud, no offense intended to the author of course. It just didn't happen."
1,"I liked the backcover blurb, but...","This book was romantic drivel. It made me think it was pulled directly from the pages of an early 1970s Harlequin. While wonderful at the time, this book will leave today's modern romance reader cold. Latter Day Saints, this is a book you can sink your teeth into."
2,not what it could have been,"I was very excited about this book when I read the back cover. Unfortunately the book doesn't live up to its potential. I liked the main plot but the author didn't spend much time describing the characters, the scenery. She left you hanging. The romantic scenes left me cold. I wish she had taken the time to really develope this story. I would pass on this one."
3,Hooked on Fishin',"If a person is into ""big game"" fishing, then this CD is for them.The songs, by various artists, are hilarious and done in the""Jimmy Buffett"" style. Clever lyrics and catchy tunes are included."
1,Don't waste your money,"Although they appeared to be working (they glowed, and we'd hear the occasional ZAP) it didn't take 6 months before one of them completely stopped glowing, and they made no dent at all in the mosquito population - the reason we bought them. Not worth it at all."
1,Westinghouse bug zappers,I am not too impressed with the solar bug zappers. The only thing is zaps is knats or maybe an occasional mosquito. Bigger bugs are not drawn to it and if they do happen to get in they can just crawl out without getting zapped. So I guess I would have to say it is not worth the money I spent for it.
5,Fantastic Holiday Music,"First of all, I absolutely love Christmas music. It's one of the things that I look forward to when the holidays roll around. It's also a time when I go searching for new music to listen to.I came across this jazz CD when I was browsing through the Jazz MP3 section. It's fantastic!! I absolutely love it. There are some upbeat songs and some really mellow songs. It's exactly what I had hoped a Christmas jazz CD would sound like.I was going to rate a couple of the artists, but there's really no need. The songs flow very well unto each other.I would definitely recommend this to all you Christmas song loving people out there. Even if you just need some background music for your holiday parties, this is the perfect fit."
5,Fantastic,"Perfect Christmas Jazz album! As the other reviewer said, a good mix of upbeat and slower tunes. They all flow very well with each other."
2,"Poor stitching, doesn't hold up","I recently purchased 8 of these bras and although I loved the fit, I'm afraid that 4 out of 8 have had an identical problem in stitching at the center top part of the bra. All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines. I'm greatly disappointed"
5,One of few pass-through cables!,Was looking for an ipod power cable that would let me also plug in a microphone. This is one of the few that I could find. As a bonus it's a general purpose USB charger for your car!
4,A book to be read twice--at least,"Like most of the great works of Modernist literature (""Ulysses,"" Proust's ""...Temps Perdus,"" ""Mrs. Dalloway"") this is a book written to be re-read. Only on a second or third reading, can we understand the ironies and motifs hidden to us on our first encounter. Unlike life, literature allows us to do things again, and do them better the second time. So, if you've read Petersburg once and feel baffled, put it down for a few months and then return to it. Read it again. Trust me, it gets better."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I was asked by Amazon to review this purchased book. Which I had ordered based on a Nabukov recommendation as the greatest book ever, etc., etc. I couldn't get past the first few pages. It hurts to read it. Really. It's painful. But then at times, so is Nabukov. And I've read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, all great, deservedly so. And never painful."
2,"Hate to Say It: I Didn't find Bely's ""Masterpiece"" Any Good","I'm sorry, but I apparently disagree with Nabokov. While an interesting read, ""Petersburg"" is confusing to the point of absurdity (not in a good way) and ultimately not very enlighting. When thought of in the context of the Revolution of 1905, Bely's occult beliefs, etc., the novel is slightly more interesting but still not worth the time and mental effort required to read it. Some might say I'm missing something, but I would say their looking too hard. You'd be better off actually reading ""Ulysses"" or, if you want some Russian, ""Brothers Karamazov"" or some Chekhov."
3,It Dies Today is going downhill,"When i began listening to The Caitiff Choir, i realized how amazing ITD is. Sure they are pretty much typical metalcore, they have some pretty sweet riffs (Freak gasoline fight accident) and some damn good breakdowns with complitcated rhythms. I heard Sacred Heart and A constant reminder and i figured that this was gonna be a good CD, so i got it. I was very dissapointed. theyre selling out, id say even atreyu is better than them at this point. Brooks' clean vocals are very whiny and sound like they should be a pop-punk album. the guitars are still pretty cool, but the drumming isnt as good as it used to be. and the breakdowns, and there are only a few, are boring, simple breakdowns. Hopefully with the new vocals, ITD will make a comeback."
2,A Change for the Worst Indeed,"Just to let you know, this does not sound like Killswitch Engage or As I Lay Dying. It Dies Today was a brutal metalcore band and they had a unique sound to them. Now, the singer has lost all the brutality in is voice. And without that brutality, this album has nothing to let itself stick out. I honestly enjoyed the first two song a little bit. But then, it got boring. There were no masterful bridges or really butt-kicking guitar riffs. ""Bridges Left Burning"" is my favorite song from them because it has one of the best endings I have ever heard in a song. This new album has absolutely nothing like that. It's become formulaic and that's why it's boring.I honestly don't understand what happened. I really enjoyed ""The Caitiff Choir."" Now, I can take change in music. I understand completely if they change their style a little bit. But they just lost everything I loved about It Dies Today in this album."
3,a change for the worst,i dissagree with the first reviewer. i have been listening to this band since there first debut forever scorned and what made this band so great was the sound of metalcore like you never heard it before with excellent breakdowns killer riffs and vocals that not anyone can produce in the metalcore genre. and they just threw it away to be a teeny booper band. i gave them 3 stars because the album as a pop metal cd was a decent effort but a bad idead because the singer live sounds like steve erkle when he sing sings.
2,nonononononononononononononono,"This band used to be exactly what I was looking for; amazing riffs, brutal breakdowns, and heartfelt lyrics. Now, all I see is a band just trying to cash in on what used to be an underground scene. Too many bands (Atreyu, All That Remains, Eighteen Visions...) are taking hardcore to the mainstream, but that is not a good thing! I used to love what hardcore was about, and I wouldn't mind the change if it wasn't so crappy! All I see in this cd is a once great band's sad attempt to gain control over a dying scene. If you want my advice, don't waste your time or money on this radio-friendly opus. It makes me sad, thinking about how many people think this is real metalcore. Wake up people! Pop-core is taking over, and most people can't tell the difference between the two!"
4,BRING NICK BACK!!!!!,"It's a shame and so sad that It Dies Today's original singer left thbe band! And now they got a new voclaist named Jason Wood. Songs ""Sacred Hearts"", ""A Constant Reminder"", ""Re-ignite The Fires"", ""Black Biles, White Lies"", and ""On The Road (To Damnation)"" were my favorites and very addicting for me. How could Nick leave the band?! He was an awesome singer! Even though that this band isn't as heavy and brutal as they were back then, the guitars aren't that heavy and catchy anymore, and the drumming isn't as fast as before either. This is Nick Brooks' last work and now he's on a new project, Queen City Station. We will all miss him! But still, good record."
1,The Real Jan was smart for letting the fake Jan take Over!!,I saw this and man was this corny beyond belief! Eve Plumb the real Jan turned this down. Smart girl! I love the original classic TV show though which yes can be kind of corny but not as much as that variety show!
4,Good program,"I am pleased with the Living Language system. It provides a good baseline for a beginner to the language: pronunciation, verb use, basic vocab. It also gets you thinking in French: hearing a statement, processing it, and responding appropriately. Also used their Tagalog beginner book and had good results. A good in-between if you don't want to invest the $$ in courses or Rosetta."
2,Not for beginners!,"I am just beginning to study French and according to the reviews, this course would have been a good start. Not so. It starts out with full conversations, too indepth, too detailed and doesn't have the English easily viewable to even follow along.I have found two other French Study Lessons at the Public Library which are much better suited for true beginners."
2,Overwhelmingly Difficult!,"When I put in the first disc for Beginning French, I thought I had put in the wrong one. The first CD starts by speaking in full sentences with no English. They speak so quickly and unless one is familiar with the language, you will be lost. Absolutely of NO use if you are trying to listen in your car. I did sit down with the book but the CD does not tell you where on the page it is and they skip around. By the time you find your place, they are somewhere else. I found it to be very frustrating. I have learned Italian pretty well before a trip to Italy, using a different program. But I could not learn French from this program and can not recommend it at all."
3,need classes,great book. comes with 12 cd's...however they dont relate 100% to the book there is alot on them that isnt in the book so you have no reference and they dont speak slower on those examples.as a textbook for someone learning french through lessons it would be amazing though!
2,It's ok,It's just another language learning book. I didn't have the earning to go back to pick up where I left off. Get this book if you want additional exercises in addition to working with other books.
1,Ultimate French,Was supposed to come with audio CDs but didn't so product is unusable. So they come separate? Would like to purchase the audio for the text.
1,no cd package,the book did not come with a cd package at all.i this is a waste of money. i received the book and had a note the rest of the items will be made separately..however it never came.
3,Slow Down!,"For a beginner, the dialogues on the CD are spoken much too quickly! I would understand if they were spoken quickly one time to be able to hear how they would sound naturally. But then they need to be repeated more slowly so that a beginning student can try to follow along. Even the repetition phase of the CD (when you repeat after the native speaker) goes too fast. For intermediate french, this would work, but not for beginning."
2,I wanted to like it,"Okay, now I'm feeling like Simon on American Idol. Sorry, I wanted so much to enjoy this book that does, indeed, capture the ambience of New Mexico. But it just did not do it for me. The problem was that I could not find myself realy caring whether they found Bobby, or, as whining Rachel would insist, Roberto. I respect the authors for a good try and hope they keep at it. However, this one didn't make the grade for me. When I discovered my Amazon-purchased copy jumped from page 217 t0 247, the ommision did not irritate me, even though I think those pages clued the reader on Bobby's fate."
4,Sunlight and Shadow,"I enjoyed reading Sunlight & Shadow immensely. It's a novel placed in the multi cultural setting of contemporary NM. The blend of cultures, personalities & generations evoked a wide range and intensity of feeling for me. I laughed; cried; I raged; I worried. Having lived in NM for over 30 years I find it hauntingly familar. This is a book for people who embrace diversity; people who smile when others are different from themselves and know they're not that different. I sincerely hope there is a sequel.CJA"
1,Burnout 5 Is Not Paradise,I wish I would have known the following before I wasted $60 on this.Road Rage is still my favorite except Open World = No Instant Restart = Lame. Constantly checking the map sucks. Crash Mode is gone. And there's no split-screen. With the Burnout series the only thing I want to do is Crash Mode and Road Rage with my wife. Thank you EA for making my wife cry!Now go make Burnout 6 fun again...
2,I can't believe how much i didn't like this game,I bought Burnout Paradise because of how much i like Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge. Everyone i talked to just loved this game. Now when I popped this game in my 360 i was taken away with the nice graphics and the speed and flow of the game was great. But after spending about thirty minutes playing the game i realized it is more frustrating than fun. If you don't care about endlessly crashing and losing than you will have fun with this game. I don't like the open world aspect to the game because it is very difficult to hit your turns when you constantly have to look at a bad map while going at full speed. The desicion to force the gamer to rely on a map really hurts this game. It reminds me of another game called midnight club on the ps2 which had terrible gameplay. This game is very dissapointing and now I have to go back to gamestop and get back my copy of burnout revenge.
3,Overall a fun race game,"Overall it is a fun racing/crash game. Large city with lots of different races, jumps & off road short cuts. outside of racing your options are minimal. A few preselected paint schemes and no modifications can be made to the cars. I've played about 8 hours on this game and yet to find a hard to beat race. So if you want more of a challenge, I would look for something different. (I'd say I fall in the ""average level"" as a gamer)"
5,Awesome,"This game is awesome, i only paid 15$ and the game was in perfect condition. i think it came in like 4 days. 5/5 overall"
2,Not the best racing game,Burnout Paradise is a step down from its predecessors. It doesn't offer Multiplayer offline and the different game options are all in the campaign. It also makes you buy other features in the game. I just wish I have borrowed it or bought it from a yardsale
2,Too Different From the Previous Games,"I received this as a gift. A week or two later I gave it to a friend because I didn't want it, it's nowhere near as fun as previous Burnout titles. So many of the things that made those games fun has been taken away, and this game feels far too repetitive and one-dimensional to offer much else on its own. I was bored with it after an hour or two, I certainly feel bad for anyone who paid $60 for it."
3,Limited in scope,"The soundtrack, the objectives, and the race areas are not as good as previous games. The only thing that made me buy this one for my new 360slim is that the rest were made for the old XBox. If the concept had stayed and they had just updated the game to have better graphics, I would think this game a lot better."
2,Screwed up a great franchise,"First off, I've played Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge so I have some experience with past games. Somehow they managed to mess up a good thing, as after playing this for about an hour or so I was already frustrated. Instead of just picking events you want to play, you have to drive around to the one you want. & considering how huge the map is, it's more frustrating then fun. & a lot of times I lost races just because of glare from the sun (yes, I have no idea why they'd put glare in the game.)Honestly I'd just play Burnout 3 or Revenge, they're more fun than this game will ever be."
1,Wow...HUGE LET DOWN,"I've been waiting for this game for over a year now. One of the great things about Burnout Revenge was the fact you could crash into other cars and get a power boost...with Paradise if you hit a car from behind going to fast you will crash...why? The race mode is horrible now, you have to keep your eye on the map the whole time because there are so many different routes to take, playing with somebody else isn't nearly as fun because the takedowns aren't nearly as frequent. What a huge let down compared to Revenge."
3,Great Vendor - so so game,"I got this game for my son. I bought it used from the Amazon marketplace. The game is decent, my kids played it for 5 or 6 hours and haven't touched it since. There was nothing bad about the game and they enjoyed it while they were playing. However, after awhile the powerups and new cars that you get as you progress through the game weren't interesting enough to keep them going.In case this review is used for the vendor that sold the game... the vendor was great, delivered on time and in promised condition."
3,Fun game but its hard to concentrate on everything but your car because the game color is odd,"The colors in this game are blan similar to the movie ""the book of eli"" so if youve ever seen that you know what im saying. There are no bright colors just dull reds and blues. Other than that the game is pretty fun but lacks a main menu which is a pain in the butt."
4,"Easy to learn, fun to play, downloadable content","Burnout Paradise is one of the best racing games I've played. The controls are simple, so it's easy enough for even my three year to play.The open city to drive is great for just having some fun and there are so many challanges that there is always something to do.Recently, the Bike Pack was released, allowing you to ride motorcycles within Paradise City. Criteron Games has committed to even more downloable content in the future as well.For the $30 price, this game is a must have for anyone who enjoys racing games."
4,Lots of Fun,"I played this myself, and I have 5 and 9 year old sons who also played, and we all enjoyed it. Initially it was a little confusing and I highly recommend the tutorials. Once we got into the game it was quite fun, even for my 5 year old who didn't understand half of it but didn't have too much trouble with the controls. What I really liked was the freedom and open-world aspect of the game. There seem to be no shortage of events and random things to do. The graphics are very good and the game play is addictive. Top grades on this product!"
2,A Little Disappointing,"After playing games like Burnout 3, this game seems a little shallow, the open world isn't as fun as it sounds, there aren't too many tipes of game, the showtime is great at first but after a few times it's just boring..the game has great graphics, great controls, but Burnout used to be a good crashing game. Now the crashing seems to be a secondary objective in a game that doesn't have a primary one."
1,In-game Advertising,"I just read an article where EA talks about selling advertising to the Obama campain. There's going to be an ad in the XBox 360 version that reads, ""Obama for President"". I think that is going to far. Revenue from sale of the game should be enough for EA, but no, they have to sell ad space so they can make even more money at our expense. No thanks."
5,Fast and Fun!,I love this game! It is fast and has lots of action. Love how you have to run down the cars to gain them into your garage!
1,Hate Burnout Paradise,"I truly wish I would have checked reviews from my friends before trusting the critics on this game. I absolutely hate Burnout Paradise. I loved the games before this one but whoever did this one screwed the pooch. There are no set races you basically just wander aimlessly around a beautifully drawn city with no real goals of any kind. Quite often you'll accidently start a race only to realize too late you did and smash into something and lose.WTF reviewed this game, extremely drunk critics perhaps, that thought driving around and doing absolutely nothing else was the greatest game ever? If you love the Burnout Series just think about how the old games are and then play this game and you may hate is as much as I do. I stupidly bought the game new and paid full price."
3,Frustrating,"The previous Generation 1 XBox game allowed players to rack up points by crashing. There's no more intentional crashing. This game has become much more of a racing game. The open design means that you have to use a GPS to find your way around while racing. You just have to drive around looking for street lights until you find the event you want. I don't want bother looking at a stupid GPS while I'm trying to race--it's too distracting. I've beaten the game on all levels but there was far more frustration than fun along the way. Also, finding stunt jumps during the ""stunt"" events is very difficult under pressure. I'm not sure why EA insists on making things more complicated when games are supposed to be fun. I'll go back to Burnout when the game designers get a clue."
3,Eh? It's OK,"I have to admit upfront, that racing games are not my first choice in gaming. I'm far more likely to take up a role playing or first person shooter option, but, I wanted to give this a chance and overall I found it to be entertaining but difficult to enter into any sense of progression to where I'd want to keep coming back for more.My sons, who like racing games, found the experience average and didn't compare it strongly against other games that they have played.So all I can say is that it's fun in small doses.3 stars.Bart Breen"
5,One of the great novels of the Roaring Twenties.,"This is the classic story of an artist who devotes himself to his art and dies young -- only the artist is one Rick Martin, one of the best trumpet players ever, and the art is jazz music. Reading this book -- though the prose is so lyrical, you don't read it, you hear it -- you will find yourself in a world of speakeasies, big bands, and the Harlem Renaissance; but the story is universal, and Rick Martin a tragic hero on par with Jay Gatsby. Highly recommended, especially to fans of jazz music and anyone who wants to know how the ""Jazz Age"" got its name"
2,Five stars? For real?,"Johnnie Taylor sounds alright on this, but the band is terrible. Out-of-tune, missing cues, and generally screwing up what should be a good CD. And you can hear Johnnie get madder and madder until, by the end, it sounds like he's glad it's over with. I have to imagine the reason this was not released back in the day the was that the band is embarrassingly bad. I feel bad for Johnnie Taylor listening to this. Five stars, y'all? Are we listening to the same CD?"
1,Where's the feeling??,"I have been an Alabama fan for years. This CD is a huge disappointment. Most songs seem to all have the same rhythm and there is a total absence of dynamics. There is no excitement to the songs and the voices sound tired. The accompaniment is thin, at best. Their adaptation of ""Precious Memories"" is a travesty-dull, dull, dull."
3,"Great service, music is okay.","I was a little disappointed when I heard this album. The songs are wonderful, but the arrangements are missing that great Alabama harmony."
4,This is Oingo Boingo... at least without Danny Elfman,"I think the person who was whining about this being only a Doug Legacy album needs to look at the liner notes. This IS Oingo Boingo, maybe without some of the horn section, oh yah and Danny Elfman, but the core is there. Steve Bartek on the Guitars, John Avila on the Bass, Johnny Vatos Hernandez on the Drums, Sam Phipps on the Sax... almost all the gang, As Oingo Boingo fans we have to take what we can get."
4,Elenco AK-510,"Kit components received were adequate quality. Some soldering and assembly difficulties were encountered. Only one component failed. Elenco technical support helped troubleshoot the problem, and replaced the component expediently. Instructions are well written, and definitely intended as a learning project."
2,Ummmm.......,"Well, I do have a strong, territorial, whatever that crap was, I do have it, and it's EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!!! The Alarm wakes me up at 5:00 AM because my dad's SHADOW! passes nearby. GOODNESS GRACIOUS!!!!"
5,"Tripnotic Trance...Blue Foundation ""Sweep of Days"" my FAV so far!","Blue Foundation is a new band for me, I discovered them from Twilight movie soundtrack..their first song I heard ""Eyes on Fire"" captured my attention right away! I then started listening to other songs, downloading 99 cent songs here and there through Amazon..but this album..I bought in entirety! All the songs are GOOD...I love their style."
4,Canon PIXMA MP800R: A Great All-in-One Printer,"I researched color all-in-one printers carefully before selecting the Canon PIXMA MP800R. If I could use half stars, I would rate this a 4 1/2. The sound level (extremely quiet), print quality and ease of use are all great. The scanner and copier work well and are fast. The wireless networking feature is great for a Small Office or Home Office (SOHO) network with several computers.The only drawback is that the unit lacks a FAX modem. I realize that FAX machines are on the way out, since you can scan a document and then e-mail it. Also, if you often copy or scan multi-page documents, buy the Canon PIXMA MP800, which has an automatic document feeder."
1,1 star for Amazon.com not Canon,"I just wanted to report that ""usually ships 24 hours"" is an inaccurate description of reality in mid June. I ordered one and the order page said that expected ship date is 8/22/06, which is 2 months away. So whoever is thinking of ordering this capable, well-reviewed printer just be aware of this."
3,Small annoyances,"I really wish that I liked this machine more than I do, since I researched it carefully and decided that ""price is not an issue."" But it does small dumb things. It's always telling me that there's a paper jam when there isn't, and opening the back is not convenient. It just switched itself from the front paper tray to the back tray, where I keep photo paper, and wasted 7 pages of photo paper before I noticed it. I switched it again to the front feed, tried to print my document, and it switched itself back. I've turned it off and perhaps it will do what I say next time.I'm also unimpressed by some of the finishing -- for example, the plastic part that moves to accommodate 4x6 photo paper in the back paper tray is flimsy and difficult to move.I've been using computers and printers for 20 years, and have owned many, so I'm not a complete bumbler. Just frustrated."
4,Satisfied,"Print quality is very good. Ability to access scanner, printer and memory card reader over network is a plus. Note setting up wireless can be abit tricky but not impossible, if you have some knowledge of networks it shouldn't be that bad. Con the range at wich you can place it my vary, walls and other obstructions can greatly decrease wireless signal. A must for small buisness or home network no more dedicated computer to host shared printer. If I had to I would definetly buy it again."
2,Volume went after warranty,Labor warranty is only 90 days. Volume went after 120days. Not worth fixing. Now must buy a new tv
5,ummmm...wow,"i'm always skeptacle on mordern movies and to be honest if it wern't for the numder of films awards this movie won i never would've bothered i'm glad i did. necrophilia, multiple murders, bizarre story, disturbing piece of work. if your gonna make a film like this you don't need a budget-its art for christs sake. worth owning"
4,I'll Bury you Tomorrow,"Gory, bizarre, unexpected twists, TWISTED...Matricide (and Patricide) brought to a deliciously different level. Alan Rowe Kelly obviously needs to be watched!"
3,"""I'll Bury You Tomorrow""",Not exactly what I expected. Not a high budget picture and the actors need to attend a few classes at an actor's studio if they want to become effective in any other productions. It was not well edited and you have to fill in a lot of blanks. However the subject matter is interesting to those who wonder what really goes on behind those embalming room doors.
1,ill Bury You Tomorrow,"Caution,Stay away from this film.Do not believe the 4or5 star reviews.They must be on crack.Save your money.I was a fool to believe these reviews.Now im stuck with a $22.00 piece of crap filmmaking.Just run away from this film as fast as you can.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"
4,a chick flick that I like,Anything that has Ben Stiller and Ed Norton in it is going to be good. Good story that also makes you laugh.
5,lndnurse,"I saw this movie on a flight to Hong Kong, and enjoyed it so much, I bought it upon my return home. Anyone who enjoys a ""chick-flick"" will love this one! The DVD has so many great extras, and the music is terrific. Everyone...go out and buy this movie! You won't regret it!"
5,Love this kind of movies!,I have just seen this movie and I think it's wonderful. From beginning to end it's sweet and touching. It's the perfect movie for everyone who likes intelligent comedy with a lot of heart. All three main Actors are great. EDWARD NORTON forever!
4,Unfaithful...????,"I watched this DVD yesterday...I must admit. I was expecting alot more comedy than was delivered. The movies started out very funny. I was laughing...however, it became way too serious and focused too heavily on lust more than love. The character of Anna, in my opinion was more of a qsuado-seductress than a loveable tomboyish best friend all grown up and both the Priest and the Rabbi fall for her. It is more Seduction than falling in love. I don't know. I liked the movie. But I can't say It is something somethat I would watch over and over again.....Still worth 4 stars......Excellent directorial debut by Norton..."
2,"Good, but it dragged","Over all, I think the only truly funny moments in the movie was when Norton and Stiller were children. This movie is over two hours long, that is just a little too long for a comedy. It dragged quite a bit."
1,THIS MOVIE IS DISAPPOINTING,"Stiller and Norton are DEFINITELY NOT at their best. Stiller does a lot of yelling (as does everyone in the show) and Norton seems to be play acting and normally I think these guys are awesome!The story line is weak and unconvincing. There is way too much kissing/sex scenes and there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stiller and ""what's her name"" Really bad. What's her names character is un-believable too. Super high powered flawless business woman. And as if Norton, a priest would go drunk and loud into the synagogue to fight it out with Stiller (who is a Rabi) Stupid.There is one funny moment in this movie and that is when Stiller is out on a date with the aerobics nut and the tug-a-war that ensues afterwards. Hilarious .. But folks -- that is about it.Otherwise it pretty much stinks. 1.5 stars"
1,comedy supposed to be funny,"When I hear ""priest and rabbi "" I expect to hear the joke next. Not in tnis film. Couple funny moments in the begining and boring melodrama for the rest. Why are these guys priest and rabbi but not carpenter and musician? And such great actors like Ben Stiller and Ed Norton look just stupid and pathetic, but not funny. Maybe because of Norton's directing. Also, heroine Jenna Elfman play is unbelievably bad, reminds me Macaulay Culkin in his worst. So save your time and money. This movie neither funny nor smart."
3,Funny but too long,"Good acting, directing, lots of funny lines, good interfaith story, but a long sit."
4,Surprisingly pleasant sleeper,"My wife and I had never heard of this one, until it appeared on Pay Per View television. Now I've seen it three times, including this past weekend with my parents.There's a slight slowdown for perhaps the third fifth of the movie, but the rest is really quite charming. The writing is witty, the acting is comfortable, and the direction and editing are both quite smart."
4,"So funny, but I had a hard time with Ed Norton as a priest..","I LOVED this movie!!! Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman, and Ed Norton make an excellent comical team!!! My favorite part is when Father Brian goes to pick up Rabbi Schram while Anna is over at his apartment. Catholics who befriend Jews and Jews who befriend Catholics, are sure to appreiate this movie. The only aspect of the movie that bothered me was that Ed Norton played a priest because I think he is so HOT and I had a hard time gawking at him while he was in cleric's clothing."
3,My Mom's favorite movie,"""Keeping the Faith"" is funny, poignant and shows quite clearly that no matter what your faith is, Guilt is universal and all mothers can lay it on you, whatever you believe. While the ending was predictable, it was still very much worth watching."
1,Ed Norton - Stick to dramatic acting,"This film is embarassing. I have liked everything Stiller and Norton have done individually but man this film is bad. Promoted as a comedy, there are very few funny moments other than what you see in the trailer. The rest is a confused badly paced romance that never has any tension. The fact that these guys are supposed to be clergy is laughable. There is no chemistry between Stiller and Elfman and Norton's direction is obviously saved by editors."
1,irritatingly idiotic,"Huge fan of both Norton and Stiller, enough so that hearing that either of them is playing the lead in any movie is enough to get me to watch it. Nevertheless, this was the worst work I know of either of them doing . . . and they did it together!While the idea of two guys vying for a former childhood playmate is certainly a viable premise for a romantic comedy, I simply wasn't able to swallow the idea of their being a Catholic priest and Jewish rabbi respectively. Not for a second; and since everything that came after depended on your swallowing this, the film was painful to watch.And overlong. Just when you think it's about time to wrap up things, you check the Display on your DVD and see that there are over 60 minutes left!"
1,Not funny,"Hey, like everyone, I saw the cool trailer, the nice commercials on TV so I went to see it in the theater, and I must say that I was really disappointed, except for the first narrating scene which made me smile and a few (3-4) other funny moments like the Rabbi trading cards, this comedy is probably one of the dullest and most pointless movies in recent filmmaking.The plot at first seemed appealing, it talks about a Priest and a Raby who are best friends and in love of a girl they knew from school. And when she moves back to NY, they starts seeing her again...Well, the entire movie is boring with some really endless moments of me and my friends wondering were the plot was going.My advice, don't waist your time or money."
4,Hope for Generation X,"I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Edward Norton and I wanted to see his directorial debut. I left the theater feeling uplifted and I was proud of Norton's positive and humorous look at life. I was proud of my generation, glad that we're not all slacker pessimists like Newsweek wants us to believe.Back to the movie: humorous, entertaining portrayal of the friendship between a rabbi and a priest, and the girl from grade school who walks back into their lives more than a decade later. What ensues is a love triangle and some semi-serious semi-humorous dealing with issues like religion, family, and love.Edward Norton's directing is straightforward, but he coaxes a lot out of the script. The performances by Norton, Stiller, and Elfman are great and the product is a warm feel-good romantic comedy. I enjoyed this movie more than most other movies I saw this summer, and would definitely see it again."
4,very entertaining,"This is a tale of three childhood friends. It's funny but not over the top. One of the friends moves away and the two boys are left to grow up. But years later, the girl comes back. Sparks fly when they both begin to fall in love with her all over again. It's great fun."
3,"Not the best, but...","This isn't the best of what I have seen from these actors or actresses, but overall not a bad movie."
3,Keeping the faith,I am not a Ben Stiller fan. The entire story seemed to have been wrapped around him. I did like Edward and Jenna very much and the story was put together well.
3,Excellent Direction and Acting Can't Quite Save This Movie,PROSAwesome DirectionDeft storytellingGreat Performances all Around (Norton is amazing in his role!)CONSToo LongMuddy Ethical SermonryJenna Elfman
4,On-Line Movie,I am impressed with the ability to order and download a movie to my laptop. This is something I will do again and again. Technology is great!
3,Bubble Gum 4 the mind,"My wife loves it. It is like bubble gum for the mind. Nothing deep, sort of a newer ""When Harry Met Sally""."
3,"A priest, a rabbi and a girl named Anna","""Keeping the Faith"" is Edward Norton's debut as a director and he is does a good job. The story starts out funny. Norton (a priest) sits in a bar telling a story to an Irish/Sikh/muslim/jewish bartender about how he and his best rabii-friend (Stiller) are fighting over a girl. Well, you have to see for yourself, it's funny. Jenna Elfman is so incredibly beautiful and funny in this movie, who wouldn't fall for her!?The end of the film is a little too serious to my taste, even though we could have known that something like this would happen. It gives a little dark edge to an otherwise fun movie."
3,"Have Some Faith, This is a Good Romantic Comedy","Edward Norton`s directing debut focuses the story of three long-time friends, a priest (Norton himself), a rabi (Ben Stiller) and a business woman (Jenna Elfman). This friendship will turn into a troubled romantic love triangle, questioning the power of faith, trust, friendship and love. It`s funny enough, even if not hilarious, and the characters are deeper than those of an average comedy, especially Edward Norton`s priest, quite credible and realistic. As a whole, the movie is a fine, hip and witty NY love story, avoiding the usual sapiness as it doesn`t get too romantic and lame. Of course, the ending is predictable and happy as ever, but it doesn`t seem too forced and actually makes sense. A good movie for the twentysomethings."
5,Sweet!,"This is a beautiful, sensitive film that addresses issues both spritual and secular, and it manages to do it all with amazing humor! It's a movie you'll want to watch again and again and share with friends and family."
3,Nice and fun movie!,"This movie was more fun then I had expect it to be, I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I can but not 4 stars this movie is fun but very cliché. Good performance from the actors but sometime Jenna Elfman gets on my nerves but she's funny most of the time and a good actress. It's a good and funny movie to watch but I felt it could had been more to the story, I don't know exactly what but something is missing and I feel that was odd that the girl get with (Ben) and (Norton) is all okay with it at the end, I thought he love her, well anyways go rent it if you want to past a relaxing evening at home with a funny movie to get out the stress of the day or of the week."
5,not a collection of dated priest and rabbi jokes,"one of the best ""date"" movies in recent years. elfman is good in her role as corporate superstar. stiller is very credible as the rabbi juggling religion and issues of dating and marriage within the faith.edward norton really hits it out of the park portraying the priest who loses his heart but not his vocation to elfman. the characters have believable personalities that mesh well, and the fine touch of norton's directorial debut is obvious.this is one movie you will enjoy seeing several times, we certainly did."
4,Engaging Instrumentals,"This is a novel project, dating from 1988, as IRS tried to reinvigorate the market for instrumentals. Two cuts apiece by Pete Haycock (Climax Blues Band), Wishbone Ash, William Orbit (later Madonna's producer, but a known new wave artist by himself or with others previously), and Stewart Copeland, formerly drummer for the Police. Since this is a sampler, full length releases on the No Speak label were also available by each. I really like the Haycock and Ash tracks, which reflected (understandably) classic rock or blues influences, and Orbit's work, with his ""Via Caliente"" denoting a tropical flavor."
1,Color was really disappointing,I ordered the Kiwi color which arrived looking faded and worn out just out of the box. Color doesn't look anything like the photo. Not worth the money.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING...,"Very low-budget program. Two actors who are used over and over again, walking, strolling, reflecting, running, sighing, staring, falling down. Repetitive scenery shots abound. Little useful information, and very few clans. Monotonous narrator. Could have been an informational delight. Instead, a static drone."
3,"Okay, for what it is.","Scottish Clans/ Scottish Verse (Ken Gray, 2001)Have you ever gone to a museum that showed videos? You know the kind I'm talking about-- produced on next to no budget, with frequent reuse or stock footage and extensive narration? That's what these two small pieces are, and as long as you're ready for that, these aren't bad little movies. Scottish Clans, the longer of the two, is basically a rundown of many of the major historical clans, with some background on each. Scottish Verse is recitation of, well, Scottish verse. And, as expected, stock footage. **"
4,Really enjoyed this DVD.,"Though the other reviews were a bit ""harsh"", I enjoyed watching this dvd. The scenery is beautiful & the info, useful."
5,Great Coverage,"I love this foundation. It covers & evens out my complexion SO well. Naturally, the price on Amazon is a HUGE bargain!!!"
2,Great book but..,"This is a great book but it lacks scientific evidence and it rests it's theories on one experiment conducted by the author, the experiment itself was hardly done under the strict standards of the scientific community, he didn't even have a control group, by what is he comparing it with!! I can see why so many people can get sucked in by it but the empirical mind will see it for what it is. It does have intresting theories but with very little (if any ) concrete evidence."
3,"Omega - 3, the essential food.","Omega - 3 is an essential food & essential edditive to most of us which need it for every day activities. Our body & our mind can't stay for long without the Omega - 3 and because of short of this product in the westeren diet we are suffering many kind of new ilness which weren't known in the past. The book which lighted one of the Omega - 3 qaulities, based on a small grup and that why it couldn't be more than another article of Omega - 3."
2,tight fit,This item will need to be modified before installation.The design seems like it is for older radios.I had to cut and grind/file the insert to install the new radio.I also cut the bottom of the kit because it was crooked with to muchspace below the pocket.Also note: The directions for the installation of the screw mount assy are poor.It can be done... After a couple of attempts and figuring out how to decipher all the different possible pieces and how the pieces are referenced in the directionsOnly then will you be on your way.
5,Where are the goods?,"Best line in the movie, if you have seen it, you should know what im talking about. Best dubbed voice evar."
4,Jackie Chan at his best,"This is Jackie Chan's best movie. Awesome fight scenes. Most seem very realistic. The usual awesome Jackie Chan stunt scenes. This is Chan's version of James Bond. Also one of Chan's funniest. Any Chan fan will like it.As a government agent, Chan is sent out with a female desert guide to search for the tons of lost gold in a buried WW2 Nazi base in North Africa. Along the way, Chan picks up another female accomplice, the German granddaughter of a former base officer.Several other governments are also aware of the gold, but don't know its location. They either fight Chan or try to follow him to the gold. Good, believable story. Great scenery."
4,great film,This IS A GREAT FILM. THE FIGHT BETWEEN JACKIE AND THE FOUR BLACK WOMEN IS WONDERFUL. THIS FILM IS ONE YOU SHOULD BUY!
4,Four Stars for Chan,"I bought this DVD knowing it would be cut like most US films of Jackie's. The reason I bought it is because Jackie dubs his own voice - I just love his voice, whether he is speaking Cantonese, Mandarin or English! It just adds so much more to the enjoyment of his movies I feel. And there are cut scenes - the most obvious a very funny scene in the desert with Jackie trying to give his female off-siders water without their bumbling Arab captors knowing! Notwithstanding all this, this film is one of Jackie's best with amazing stunts and the fight scene in the wind tunnel has to be seen to be believed. A must see, whether it is this version or the original uncut Cantonese with English S/T."
3,"Las películas de Jakie Chan, aunque no son muy biuenas, valen la pena, nada más por ver todo lo que hace. Los años no le afectan","Las películas de Jakie Chan, aunque no son muy biuenas, valen la pena, nada más por ver todo lo que hace. Los años no le afectan."
3,This is Operation Condor 2!,"The other reviews were talking about the first Operation Condor, which was very good, and I recommend it highly. Operation Condor 2 is also good, but not wonderful, I think. If you are a major Chan Fan such as I, buy this. This is the movie that nearly killed Jackie, and has some very impressive stunts and fight scenes in it. If you are a first time Chan watcher, I recommend Who am I?, Rumble in the Bronx, Heart of Dragon, Mr. Nice Guy, First Strike, or Drunken Master."
4,Lots of Fun!,"This movie is a very intentional Indianna Jones parody, and I think it's very funny. But it does contain some nudity and sexual innuendo, which is unusual for a Jackie Chan movie. It's also better than its ""prequel"" Operation Condor part 2 (I gave that movie 5 stars, but in retrospect I think I would only give it 4). By the way, anyone who enjoys Jackie Chan should go to their local library and check out some Buster Keaton movies. I recommend ""Sherlock Jr."" which Buster broke his neck making, and ""Our Hospitality"" which he very nearly drowned making, among others. Buster's stuntwork and athleticism remain unsurpassed, even by Jackie Chan! ""The General"" is also excellent."
4,"Excellent film, more features should have been added","I love to watch Jackie Chan in action, the only reason this DVD didn't get full 5 stars is, as I prefer to watch the movies in Chinese with English sub titles, better sound. Apart from that Top Film."
4,Status fades...and dumb IS forever!,"I just saw this video while celebrating Hitchcock's 100th birthday with my own ""marathon"" viewing of his work here at home. This movie started out one way (predictably), but it turned out to be very intriguing as it progressed; especially with the quasi-Titanic scene(s)! Now I need to pass it on to those friends who really DO think money buys happiness and contentment! Mary in Northville"
2,An okay modern movie,"Was sweet how they chose to portray an imperfect pregnant woman, but I was disappointed in how the movie strayed from traditional values and styles I'm used to seeing in Indian movies. If I wanted to see an American movie I'd watch an American movie."
1,"Oooooh LOL {gracious me, hahahaha! hahHAHAHA!}","You know, I simply do not even recall ever watching this bollywood flick. I can't tell you anything about it other than it shows in my records that I indeed purchased this Salaam Namaste DVD~oh goodness.... just remembered. YES! I had checked it out of the library abt one yr. ago and it was one of the most boring movies I ever set my eyes on, so I fell asleep. The high-pitched singing woke me up, so turned it off. The next day was gathering a bunch of DVDs I'd checked out to return them to the local library, however noticed my cat had knocked this dvd onto the floor & it cracked. This is why I purchased this movie, as a REPLACEMENT for the library as I obligated to. No, this movie really sucked. Good choice for insomniacs however."
2,Fragments of Brilliance,"I had high expectations for this book after reading ""Throwing the Elephant: Zen and the Art of Managing Up"" and ""What would Machiavelli Do?"". Bing's black humour brought some relief to the entirely too serious business of business. After all, we all need to be able to laugh at ourselves, right?This book is a collection of snippets on a wide variety of business experiences written between the late eighties and the present day. Given that there is no explicit theme for this book (apart from the madness of business and the people within it), I struggled to finish it.Although some of the material provides 'applied learning' that will be universally relevant and recognisable, frankly chunks of it just aren't that amusing. Weird - yes, ironic - yes, funny - sorry, no."
2,A Bing collection,"A compilation of pieces from Esquire and Fortune over the past twenty years or so is what we have here. Kind of a mixed bag, at times very funny, others not so. I found myself wanting some of the articles to go on longer."
4,Still Good After All These Years...,"ALthough there's no surround sound, this is a very good show. I bet it'll startle your kids at the end, if they've never watched it before."
4,"Joseph Ruben's ""Dreamscape""","To Some It Will Seem A Little Far Fetched, But In This Film, Psychics Can Enter Other People's Nightmares And Put An End To Them...If You Can Go Along With The Premise, This Movie Will Reward You With Fantastic Special Effects, Thrills, Chills, And Surprises...Starring Dennis Quaid, Max Von Sydow, Christopher Plummer, Kate Capshaw, And Eddie Albert..."
3,good,"I like this movie. It's a little contrived, but the premise based on the myth of if you die in your sleep, you die in real life, is a good one. I actually was going to University of the Pacific in Stockton when they filmed scenes from this movie there. And the 1980's El Nino was hitting California, so Eddie Albert and the guys playing his body guards were unable to fly up to Stockton because of the weather. And a friend and I were hanging around the set, and they told us to come back in suits and ties to maybe be the body guards in the background! Pretty cool for college students! So we showed up, and, typical show biz, they had asked a bunch of other students to show up in coats and ties, too, and they never used any of us. But there is a scene where I can see a girl I used to date in the background as an extra!! (Dennis Quaid was arrogant and full of himself, incidentally. But this is a cool movie)."
2,Could have been better.,"Dreamscape has a great cast of actors and an interesting story,but the special effects are often cheesy and the production style is a little weak.In the hands of a better producer,this could have been a much better film. It looks a little cheap."
1,"The DVD censors at it again. On a special edition, no less!","I love this movie. It was one of the first PG-13 flicks to come out, so when I was a kid this was quite exciting. It had some action, some nudity and a snake-monster all rolled into a fun pseudo sci-fi package.Imagine my disgust and horror upon discovering that the DVD of the film had been edited for content! Don't believe me? Compare it to the video or laser version. The comical sex dream scene at the beginning has been altered so that there are no breasts. There are also no children watching. This may not seem all that important to you, but I think that this silent trimming is quite insidious. The film is rated PG-13 after all, which means that parents should be cautious about showing it to younger kids. Why then must it be cut without telling us so on the package?To sum it up, I love the movie, but I hate this version. Hooray for Hollywood."
1,altered,"i love this movie, however, for some reason, someone has decided to edit all of the romantic scenes, brief nudity, etc. from the dvd version. if that isn't bad enough, they don't tell you that it has been altered from it's original content. i bought this dvd thinking i was getting the original that i loved only to get a chopped up version. rotten deal!"
1,This Title Deserved Better,"No movie censored for content deserves to be called a ""Special Edition"". Recommend this as a possible rental, but not as a buy, even for the current price."
3,Great film - shame about the cuts,"I saw this film years ago on TV and loved it. In fact I've still got an ancient video version that I taped over 10 years ago.It was great to see it again in widescreen and with DVD quality and it was as good as I remember - except for the cuts.In the UK we get films cut all the time, a little at the cinemas and often more on VHS. So imagine my shock to discover a Region 1 DVD with more cuts than the UK television version of over 10 years OK. In the version I originally saw the nudity in some scenes was limited, mild and ""in context"" in my opinion. So I am amazed it was cut from this DVD release.However - I'd still say this DVD is still well worth owning if you like this film. The picture is great and the sound is even better."
5,A MUST HAVE,"This was a really good old movie!! I have never seen this before and I have hundreds and hundreds of mivies, so this one caught my eye and I'm very happy with it! get this movie!"
3,They're not bad after all,"English is clearly not their first language! Much of their enunciation is phonetic, but as a choir technically, I have heard few better. Their arrangement of Silent Night is by far the single best I've heard in my life! It will practically stop your heart! A full third of the songs were new to me, but they are nicely done, bright and pleasant. This is a great CD for new arrangements, or for some nice light choral background Christmas track."
5,Excellent CD!!!,"Excellent CD!!!, The disc quality is excellent and the cover of the album is good. Excellent product I was looking"
3,An appraisal from a professional archaeologist.,"Although it is a classic overview of the archaeology ofnon-Maya Central America, a topic on which references are few and far between, this book is now hopelessly out of date.Readers are advised to look for more recent literature,or to at least be advised that most of the information inthis book has been revised as a result of new research."
4,Depp makes it palatable,Depp brings empathy to an amoral druggie. And makes this fact based tale watchable. Well done.
5,Really good,"Wow...I have to tell you that as much as this was compared to other recent cocaine movies, like Traffic, this movie reminds me of nothing less than Goodfellas. The characters are very much brothers from different mothers. Very good comparison. And to anyone who has entertained notions about Penelope Cruz' sexiness, you may be in for a rude surprise.Having said that, since Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz are dating, well, doesn't it take a special kind of ego for someone to date someone else because their last names are pronounced the same?"
4,"""Ordinary People"" meets ""GoodFellas""","Ok, maybe my review title ain't all that accurate. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie immensely.Its not perfect, treats some of the subject matter a little more patly than I would have liked. You would think a movie like this would be a film about the coke industry of the 70s and 80s. Instead, the film is a tragedy, Jung's meteoric rise to fame and fortune, his crash and burn, his numerous attempts to right himself, his numerous failures.You wouldn't know it going into it, but this film is about a man (albeit through some illegal, immoral, and unethical means) trying to provide for his family. Don't go into this looking for the next ""GoodFellas"" or ""Boogie Nights"". It's a single-man character study, and as such (IMHO) succeeds admirably.The ending of the film still haunts me."
5,Lesson learned,"""Blow"" desplicts the reality of the consequences suffered from selling drugs. Its unique theme was brilliantly written. The years passing by was perfected by the costume designers and hair stylists. Johnny Depp was the perfect actor to play the lead character in his Oscar worthy role. All other actors perfectly portray their characters wonderfully: a loving father, a hateful mother, a betraying friend, a cancer patient, and many druggies.Those who want to know the consequences desplicted must watch ""Blow"". Giving away all of them would ruin the movie effect for first time viewers. In the end, one will not be disappointed."
2,DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE,"This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films."
4,Depp is brillant,"Depp always commit full heartedly to his performances and this film is no exception. His near flawless performance as the very unlikeable George Jung, for me, is jaw-dropping as it is aspiring. There is no real point to this story other to just let us peek inside the life of a man who establish the cocaine trade in America. The director is careful to keep you at arms length while adding subtle touches to humanize Jung. The best way to do that with an American audience is to throw in a sad looking kid. We're suckers for children.Maybe the message is: If you're not careful, you too can make a career out of bad choices or maybe it's just fun to watch Johnny Depp do his thing."
2,Extremely boring,"This film seemed to drag out for hours and hours. When you find the occasional high point in this film, where you can be mildly entertianed, it ends to quickly and you are thrust back into the world of monotany that makes up 90 percent of this film. Johnny Depps acting was good, and his portrayal of the character was good, but this movie just seemed to never go anywhere. Never exciting, never thrilling, you feel like youre just watching hours worth of random consecutive events of some man's life. The ending of the movie is heartbreaking, and the message that his father give him becomes cruelly ironic all throughout the film, but i cant give credit to the filmakers for either of those thigns because they were real facts, not anything the directors thought up. Overall, just plain BLAND"
2,Blow lives up to the name...,"Blow is a long, boring true life-based tale of a drug dealer's life. Blow is a classic story: boy gets easy money from dealing, dealing turns bad, boy gets busted, boy looses everything, boy tries to regain life, but blows it. Buy Traffic."
3,Maybe a 6.5 to 7,It was a pretty good movie. I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it. I'd watch it again sometime.
5,Love this movie,"Who doesn't like a ""based on a true story"" movie? George Jung played by Johnny Depp is a fascinating person and lead an interesting life! And he'll be released in 2014/2015.... go George!"
5,Love this movie,"I love this movie. It's always a good one. Every time I watch it I'm like, I need to watch this more often."
3,A okay film,"not one of Jhonny Depps beast movies it was okay kinda sad that he couldn't stop dealing drugs, to be with his family. well all in all it was an okay film."
4,Good Movie & Awesome Price If Bought Used (Some less than a dollar),"I really like this movie. I bought it on here a [Amazon.com] long, long time ago. The only thing you have to keep in mind is just because it is actually based on a true story & actual events does NOT mean it is an autobiography. In other words, there are of course going to be both added events & deleted ones as well. So, if you're looking for more of a biography &/or autobiography my advice is to purchase the book. However, this is a good movie & if you can just go into it either not caring that it's not a story told verbatim/word-for-word, or if you can separate the two, (book & movie) then, I really feel almost anyone will very much enjoy this movie. Besides, if you buy it on here you can purchase a used one for close to nothing, so if you end up to hating it then you at least you haven't lost much. I say go for it."
4,so does not !,"this honey holds up to many repeat viewings thanks to all the usual reasons . great writing , direction , cinematography , editing and a very commited ensemble . the editorial write up nails it yet again . these things can be stated succinctly ya know ? do you get favorable feedback for articulating at great length what people already know ? evidently . go to town wordsmiths ."
2,Great movie!,I really liked this movie! They picked the perfect character for Pee Wee Herman to play. I thought the movie was really good except for the constant whinning of his mother! What about me???? What about me??? I't get's really old after awhile listening to her complain! Otherwise I thought it was a great movie! Johnny Depp was real convincing as a drug dealer. My suggestion by this movie!
5,Blow is Great,This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish. Johnny Depp is mezmerizing and the rest of the cast is awesome
4,Crime does not pay. No honor among thieves. A very good life lesson based on a true story,"The story is interesting and engaging from the beginning till the end.It's a very good life lesson based on a true story. It showed a ""big"" drug dealer can make tons of money. However it also shows crime does not pay and there is no honor among thieves. They set up each other. They stole from each other, etc.It's absolutely worth viewing."
5,Superb filmmaking! Very real in its portrayal.,"This film had a very realistic feel to it, in terms of feeling as if you are actually witnessing the fall of George Jung. The very human side of Jung was portrayed as well, enabling the viewer to decide whether they wanted to really hate him as much as they think they would loathe a typical dope pusher, or to feel some empathy for how far he sunk into his world of coke and pot dealing, at the cost of his relationship with family and his freedom. All in all, an excellent, realistic portrayal of the risky, dark, and depressing world of drug dealing."
4,Great movie,"This is a great movie, based on a true story. The performances here are top notch, starting with Johnny Depp. Penelope Cruz does a great job as well, and Ray Liotta is brilliant. This is based on a true story of how cocaine became mainstream, and I like the fact that they didn't glorify it too much, and showed the pitfalls of living a life on drugs. Definitely one to buy on DVD."
3,Blu-ray audio sync problem,"There are plenty of comments re: the merits of the movie itself, so this review is just about the sound on the blu-ray edition. It is at least a full second out of sync with the video, making it seem almost like a cheap kung fu movie that has been dubbed in English. And no, this isnt a problem with my equipment (PS3), which has successfully played over 100 other blu-rays without audio sync problems."
3,The life of George Jung,"Looking at the cover, I expected to see a bit more of Penelope Cruz; however, her role, although pivotal, was minor compared to Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp shows how the life and times of the convicted drug dealer George Jung aged and changed him.The typical movie about drug lords and dealers tend to be stark and violent. Even though this movie has its share of violence, the movie humanizes Jung to show depth and feeling. We see his motivations and concerns. Although we don't condone the behavior, we have a better insight into why this happens.The DVD has some interview footage with Jung to provide the viewer with some background information. I found this interesting, but Jung is not very animated, which can be expected from the long time spent in prison.I would recommend this movie."
2,Blow? It sure does.,"Putting it quite simply, Blow blew. While I greatly admire Johnny Depp, and think he has amazing talent as an actor, not even he, nor any of the other talented supporting cast members, could save this piece of garbage. The movie plods along slowly, without any real purpose. Sure, there are some fun scenes along the way, but the movie doesn't seem to have a real point. I'm not going to tell anyone not to watch it; everyone should form their own opinions. But I'd definitely suggest renting it before splurging on a DVD."
4,"Wonderful Drama, Action, Moving: A-, Music A+, DVD Extras A,","This is a solid drama and action movie. What makes it unique is that it is based on a true story. The music is incredible and just makes this a wonderful drama and action film! The music makes you re-live the 60's and 70's. Johny Depp is outstanding. Absolutely wonderful extras on this DVD, including an excellent documentary on Colmbia and COCAINE. This movie carries a wide variety of emotions. You'll be sure to be moved.As entertaining as this movie is, it just goes to show how that drugs and self destruction go hand in hand. Blow definitely exceeded my expectations."
4,Blow,"Blow is based on the true life of George Jung. He is the man that claims to have smuggled 85% of the cocaine that was in america during the late 70's and early 80's. He had millions upon millions of dollars, and yet was never really happy.There are few movies that get me as emotionally connected to the characters as this movie did. I knew from the beginning that, after earning tons of money from drug smuggling, he was going to fall hard.The movie takes a unexpected turn towards the middle, where instead of the fun partying, or negotiating with columbian drug lords, it is more about his relationship with his daughter, and his relationship with his father.The story is interesting, Johnny Depp plays this character with more emotion than I have seen him play in any other movie, and it is well directed and moving."
1,not closed captioned,"I am a deaf person and I count on the Closed Captioning and subtitles to be able to enjoy a movie.Even though Blow is listed as being Closed Captioned, this copy is not.A waste of my time and money."
3,I was expecting a Digital Copy with this Blu-ray?,Shouldn't the blu-ray come with a digital copy? or do they have different versions of this blu-ray? one a single disc and the other with digital copy included?
1,Boring...,"Don't get trapped! This movie is way over rated here at Amazon! Thank God I didn't buy this movie!Everything was terrible:1. Boring story. Yes it is a true story but it doesn't deserve to be written in the first place! Why did they make a movie of it?2. You'll never sympathize or get attached to any character! (lack of emotions).3. Weak dialogue!4. Zero suspense and surprises!The bottom line is don't fall into this trap! It is boring, boring, boring! Even the (Infinifilm Edition) DVD is not worth it!"
1,Yes it does BLOW!,"This movie is the worst of it's type to date. More a series of classic rock music videos strung together than anything else, It never pulls you into the world it is trying to create. Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, even Godfather III. Make this a film I think Johnny Depp should probably try and buy all copies and burn. Get the soundtrack instead. Long and boring non-involving, bad acting and bad wigs make this truly unwatchable."
1,Dry Treatment of an Uninteresting Plot,"This movie drags. The plot moves slowly. It is typical of movies with an inverted hero, the treatment of the subject is neither innovative nor exciting.The high point is seeing Pee-Wee Herman, Bobcat Goldthwait, and that 21 Jump Street guy doing a hit of coke, all together, off a bar while girls in bikinis play in the pool.Depp struggles with an amusing, forced, and marginal Boston accent. He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.But, yeah, that triumverate of acting talent doing a line, that's about the high point. The soundtrack is great, and the audio is well produced. But it's not an entertaining movie, or even a well-told story."
5,Great movie,"I've watched this film a dozen times before. Great acting, great writing, great imagery. I can never watch the ending though, because it's just too sad for me."
4,Same narrative pull as in Goodfellas,"When this movie started and Johnny Depp was using the voice over to introduce the audience to his childhood and Ray Liotta pops out of frikkin' nowhere it reminded me of that same Goodfellas drive that this movie offers. Don't confuse yourself with what I say, this movie is definitely not as close as good to Goodfellas but if has a decent story line of the life of the first man to bring cocaine into the u.s.(yeah right!) to deal it. This movie has a good cast and I don't really mind that they [copied] the same narrative structure from Goodfellas, I thought the movie was decent and was good at portraying the life of a drug dealer. If your into movies about crime and trying to achieve the 'impossible' then this is definitely worth a look!"
2,"Well acted, but emotionally empty.","Johnny Depp gives an interesting performance as George Jung in ""Blow,"" but I didn't like this film, nor did I understand its points. Was I supposed to care for Jung? His actions brought about the deaths of thousands and ushered in the current state of drugs in America. He lived in decadence by helping others ruin their lives. He lost his money, and he kept making mistakes, getting involved with drug trade when he should've gotten out of it.The film seems, to me, to want you to sympathize with Jung, yet, as a viewer, you cannot. He is not a hero.When he loses his daughter in the end, it's not sad. It's fitting.Ted Demme, who died one year after directing this, created an interesting film, but it's one that seems to make a hero out of a man who doesn't fit the mold."
3,Solid chronicle of a good guy with some bad habits,"Chronicling the life and crimes of George Jung, Blow sizzles with style, but substance (not substances, theres plenty of those here) is another story. Thanks to Johnny Depp's superb performance as Jung, we feel sorry for Jung who rose to power in the marijuana and cocaine trades through the years only to lose it all to one police bust after another and after another. If it were any other actor in the role, I doubt any sympathy would have been felt at all for Jung. The rest of the cast includes Penelope Cruz as Jung's wife, Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Ruben, Ethan Suplee, Cliff Curtis, and Ray Liotta as Jung's sympathetic, loving father. Cruz is just plain annoying most of the time, while Liotta is his usual great self in his role. All in all, Blow is worth a look, but a film which displays the dangers and consequences of addictions has been done better in films like Requiem For a Dream and Traffic."
3,"Not a bad movie, but not a terrrific one either.","The rise of a drug kingpin. From the street mary jane deals, to the 70's cocaine, and ending in prison.Good 'nuthin else to do movie'Plus Paul Rubens, as 'the hookup', if you can belive that!"
5,no scratches,Sent as an Christmas gift for my son. He said it came packaged great --just like new-- no scratches. Is very happy with the DVD. Will purchase from this site again. Gift card was a plus.
2,Highly Disappointing,"A good old boy with high hopes of getting into a life of crime rises to the top and lives the good life before experiencing marital problems, doing some jail time, and eventually becoming a paranoid cocaine addict as the walls of his decadent lifestyle come tumbling down around him. Anyone familiar with Scorsese's GoodFellas will recognize the similarities and do themselves a favor by watching it again instead of this copycat. Blow is a fair enough film for those who aren't too choosy about what they watch--it seems unfortunate, though, to waste time watching it when you could instead be seeing the highly superior films that it borrows from (GoodFellas, Boogie Nights)."
2,Heavy handed,"While the acting, directing, and general storytelling was solid, I thought the movie was little more than a heavy-handed morality play disguised as a self-indulgant biographical exposÉ. Truth is, I just didn't find the characters interesting or sympathetic and the ending made me groan. They probably got funding from the US government to present the anti-drug moral lesson."
1,worst movie ever seen,"This is one of the worst movie that I ever seen. The story is boring, doesn't make sense.Casts were ok,cheap production."
3,"great acting, but not engaging","This movie went straight to video here, and although has an interesting storyline, the film jumps too quickly between periods to really pull you in. Johnny Depp was excellent, as was Rachel Griffith. Johnny Depp plays a real life cocaine dealer who eventually gets what he deserves.A movie that overall is quite boring to watch. Rent it."
5,Everyone forgot Pablo!,"Yes, this movie is about the rise and fall of George Jung, however the most important person in the movie... Pablo Escobar is a bit left out by the other reviewers. The movie does a great job with an excellent cast depicting George Jung's marijuana and cocaine empire's rise and fall... it even does a good job talking about Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel's role in helping George Jung. It even brings in Carlos Diego. The movie isn't as good as the book by Bruce Porter but David McKenna did a good job writing a screenplay. Great movie, deffinately worth owning!"
4,Rise and fall of a drug dealer,"This film is far from perfect but it certainly is a time capsule of the 70's annd 80's growth of cocaine culture in the US and the story of one man who played a key role in it's spread. Johnny Depp is fabulous in the lead role as George Jung and the supporting cast is solid, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz who is ok but probably the weakest performer in the movie.The story follows the unlikely rise of a middle class kid from the east coast who moves to California in 1968 and begins to make easy money dealing pot. The growing drug culture coincides with his meteroric rise and incredible wealth. Like all morality tales the guy falls just as quickly as he rose and winds up with shattered family relationships and in prison.Well written and plotted, the film moves briskly through 2 decades of George Jung's life without feeling choppy and the story is always intriguing."
5,hey!!!,"this play was excellently written by one of the most famouse playwrights of our time. the story itself is fictional but the events serrounding the story are true, the witch trials of 1692 in salem. Just a warning, to have a better undertanding and appreciation of this play, get a general information about the history of the witch trial of 1692 before reading or before viewing the play/movie."
4,Valuable but needs an update,"This book is very useful and even necessary if you're planning to go to Peru. However, prices (hotels, restaurants and airport tax...) need to be updated!"
3,Out-of-date book,The information in this book may have been accurate when first published but now (April 1999) it is well out-of-date and consequently the book has limited value. There is a new edition coming out later this year.
3,Good movie in it's day,Started to watch this movie after having not seen it for many years. It seemed a bit hokey this time around so I stopped watching it after about 20 mins. I am one who tends to not like many older movies however.
4,Vintage Dundee,A very pleasant family movie. Paul and Linda are older but have worn well. Their son was there as he should be to make up the family. I wasn't once tempted to fast-view any part - this is one of the advantages of viewing a recording.
3,It might have been worse,"Mick Dundee in LA is nowhere near the level of the first Crocodile Dundee. The movie was amusing in spots and tedious in others. Mick as a movie extra was the high point. Dinner at Wendy's drive through was a nice intro into how to order meal. The most originality came from the two special guest stars, not to mention irony in one of them.Was there a reason behind this movie beyond its been years since we've seen Crocodile Dundee in action?The old charecters, Wally, Neville and all the others who were such a vital part of the first two films are missing. Their replacements do an OK job but it just doesn't have the zing of the first two. Even the crocodile didn't have the same impact.In all, I would give this a miss, unless there was nothing else in the store to rent - as was the case when I rented it. There was nothing better and much a great deal worse. Maybe Mick should find a new day job."
4,Third One's A Charmer,"Paul Hogan allegedly got the inspiration for the original ""Crocodile Dundee"" from ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"". This installment pretty much follows form but transplants Dundee to the City of Angels and gives him and his ersatz Jane an offspring. Throw in a tired subplot involving an international art ring fronting as a fleabag movie studio you would almost dismiss this flick. Wonders never cease and the reasons are twofold. Primarily, Hogan projects such onscreen charm and charisma you would almost want to watch him reading the phonebook. Also, the makers of the film make Los Angeles look fresh and new. It helps that my wife lived in L.A. for a year and pointed things out to me that I didn't know. Most product placement is annoying but there's a pretty funny scene with Dundee and his Down Under crony at the Wendy's takeout window. Not the homerun the original flick was but it'll do."
3,croc dun ..in to L.A.,"My Hubby is a Croc fan, so bought this for him , so he could complete his Croc series..He liked the movie, so that is all that matters..."
3,well....what did you really expect?,"Well, this is certainlly an embarressing movie. As Paul Hogan tries to resurrect a dead franchise that really wasn't all that clever or popular in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I love Paul Hogan, The first Croc was good, he was ok in Almost an angel, he was a straight pimp in Lightning Jack; one of the best comedies of all time. However this...there are no words for this, every line is predictable, the acting is horrible and everything from begining to end is just just cornball and cheesey. There really was no need for this film. The reason i gave it three stars is because despite all its shortcomings, it does have charm, you can almost symphathyze with Hogan knowing he probably knew this wasn't going to work, however I watched it at two in the morning on accident and it kept me watching it; all you have to do is suspend disbelief and you feel like you are with an old friend again."
2,Don't Do It,"Don't rent it, don't watch it, don't borrow it from the library, and most of all don't buy it. I can't think of any reason why this movie was made. Hopefully someone was able to make a mortgage payment, but that is the only upside I can hope for.I loved the original Croc Dundee. I thought it was witty, and warm, and a lot of fun. I thought the 2 leads had amazing chemistry. They have NO chemistry is this movie. NONE. They were barely in any scenes together, which is a shame. It's almost as if they are in two separate movies that intersect every now and then.THe story is so contrived- she has to help her Father out- they come to LA (no- I can't beleive they live in Walkabout Creek full time), she gets enmeshed in a story, Mick yet again saves her by getting to the route of the problem, blah, blah, blah. What happened to the strong female character from the first movie? What happened to laughs? I saw nothing cute, charming, or other in this movie."
1,Review,Didn't like the product but my money was happily refunded. Would definitely do business with company again.
1,Horribly cheap construction quality,"I was very disappointed with this double boiler. I purchased one, used it twice, and on the second use, the lower handle simply snapped off as I tried to lift it off the counter. On closer inspection, it appears the handle is held on with four tiny rivets. One of the four was rusted, and the handle snapped right off, sending milk all over my kitchen. Even if it hadn't been rusted, you can tell from looking at those rivets that the handle wouldn't have stood up to years of use. It's just a shoddily made double boiler. Look elsewhere, is my advice."
1,Horrible,"This double boiler came out of the box just in time for christmas baking. I washed it and got it all ready. It is small but it worked for the purposes and was priced right. After I got done my baking, I washed it and left it to air dry. I checked it to make sure it was clean before I put it away and the cooking pan was filled with rust spots and scratches. I used a teflon baking spoon and silcone spatula while I was cooking, not metal. There is no way I could have done this myself. I now have to buy another one before I can make any recipes calling for a double boiler. It will not be this product!!!"
4,Riveting Documentary,"Others here have given extensive detail about the content of this fascinating film, so I won't bother with that. I'll just say that I came to the table with very little foreknowledge of this tragic event in history, and when it was over I felt as though I had been given a fairly balanced account. Douglas' narration is suitably understated, and the one surviving perpetrator is given an opportunity to present his side of the story (not that he comes off very sympathetically). An excellent and engrossing documentary, even if you aren't personally invested in the politics. I'd skip Spielberg's made up aftermath movie ""Munich"" and just stick to the facts as they're presented here."
2,Not a Movie just clips of events,I received this thinking it would be this film but it was an outline of events. Now the sender sent it to me on time. thank you. Although this is some weird documentary and not what I expected it to be.
5,a classic documentary,"This is the film that ""Munich"" should have been.It's the story Steven Spielberg should have told.It is a brutal,moving,and brilliant look at one of the most shocking events in history.The most remarkable thing about the movie is how unbiased and even-handed it is.The filmmakers make every effort to present both sides of the story evenly and fairly.They are remarkably nonjudgemental,even showing great sensitivity to the Palestinians as well as the Israelis.""One Day In September"" is amagificent documentary that should be seen."
3,"The real ""Munich"" is surprisingly boring","Another reviewer called this film ""tense"" and ""visceral."" I agree only with one of those adjectives -- visceral. The movie just doesn't move fast enough to keep the typical viewer's attention. Overall, good movie to see to remind yourself of the world that was, and still is, but it won't keep you on the edge of your seat."
4,Very good film,"I found this film so, so interesting that I have watched it many many times. I belive it to be one of the best done doc. films in years.I did find that the film left a lot of questions out there. Why was the German goverment so bad at handling these events? Was it that they did not want to look war like in dealing with the terroists? Was it handled badly because the were Jews in Germany and there is still a lot of antisenitesum (anti Jewish) fealing in Germany? Was it becase this was the first event like this? Or was it just a lot of bad calls on there part?The question that realy stays with me is WHY DID THE GAMES NOT STOP?"
4,Helps greatly to complete your Buddy Collection,"I purchased this CD and was pretty happy to get some of these hard to find tracks. This is definitely no ""Greatest Hits"" collection though! What you are getting is 22 fairly rare tracks, most of which were very early recordings that were overdubbed by Norman Petty after Buddy was tragically killed in early 1959. If you are a fan of Buddy, these tracks gives you a deep look into his roots with some very ""true"" country musicand a quick look at what might have been as songs like ""You're The One"" and ""Love is Strange"" which were basically home demos recorded shortly before he died. Here they are overdubbed to sound almost like a finished recording.Had to go with 4 stars here because sound quality is lacking, but probably no fault of BGO, these are very early recordings and nothing much could likely have been done."
5,A Brilliant and Stunning Tour de Force,"What you must first understand is that this album really isn't a ""Miles Davis"" recording. The musician that is truly the dominant creative force here is John McLaughlin; Miles' role is much like the other musicians on this recording - to my mind, very much secondary to the driving, primal and brilliant work of McLaughlin. McLaughlin creates the context, the foundation, on which this recording is constructed. This is a stunning work in every way, and it's value is due largely to the almost otherworldly brilliance of John McLaughlin."
5,A Fitting Tribute To A True Heavyweight,"I have always found this album as my favorite of the ""electric phase"" of Miles Davis. His solos are fabulous and the pieces - though lengthy - do not drift off into a free jazz mode.....they are tight and rock hard.John McLaughlin proves without a shadow of a doubt that he was the baddest guitar player at this time. The five-disk sessions set - a must companion piece - aptly shows McLaughlin on top of his game in jazz, rock and R&B; riffs. And head for the hills when Billy Cobham and Herbie Hancock start grooving.For those looking to start a collection in electric jazz and/or Miles, this is a perfect place to start."
5,A Tribute to Jack Johnson brings you there.,"Miles has always been an artistic master of sound and space. A Tribute to Jack Johnson sums up new directions Miles had been migrating towards. These 2 tracks are emotional, creative and powerful. The Album/CD is forever fresh in sound."
5,Great way to get rock listeners to jazz,"If you are a rock fan and thinking about jazz, this is a great album for you! This album showcases Miles, he keeps it funky and rocking at hte same time."
5,"Man, it's funky!","I was totally blown away when I first heard this. This is Miles at his funkiest, loudest and bluesiest. It sounds like so much fun!Every musician on this album is in top form and the aggressive, raucous soloing is indescribable. It's a great privilege to hear these guys settle into a groove.The cutting and pasting technique involved in making the original long jams more palatable can be a bit annoying at times but I wasn't going to buy the 'Complete Jack Johnson Sessions' when I hadn't heard one note of this album before. That's the only complaint I have with this great piece of work.Overall, it was incredibly enjoyable!"
5,MILES DAVIS AT HIS ROCKING HOUR,"I have to say that this CD is a masterpiece. The first song ""Right Off"" is really great, Miles does rock n' roll and jazz (like Miles jazz trumpet and Joe Satriani hard rock) and that is really one of Miles' best recordings ever, and one of my favorite Miles nearing 27 minutes of driving rock and jazz. Yesternow is more like other Miles a lot slower and calmer, but in the middle has a background of the first song of ""In a Silent Way"", in the end there is a voice for Jack Johnson. This is great Miles from the seventies and it is one of his greatest recordings. Every Miles Davis CD or Record collection should have this."
1,Rated one star cuz ZERO stars wasn't an option!!,"What a boring, ridiculous movie. For a film that supposedly starred Treat Williams, he was barely in the movie. Everything about the plot was highly improbable from the plane crash to the weather. The actresses in the movie continued to have perfect makeup and hairdos considering they had survived a plane crash and several days without running water or hair blow dryers. I don't have a clue how the movie turned out as I had to turn it off as my brain was rapidly turning to mush. I hope somebody buys my copy so I can get it out of the house."
2,Pathetic movie feels like a made for TV movie! Rent it first,This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!
1,rips off scences from other major movies,"This movie steals scences from the movie cliffhanger (yes their scences) This is a watch before you buy movie. this movie is just not original. sorry, but this movie is copyright crook."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"From the start this movie had all the making of a real bomb. The JetStar and DC-9 aircraft scenes were totally bogus. Treat Williams is a pilot, he should have know the flying scenes were bogus. Grizzly bears hibernate in winter. When it is 20 below zero water freezes, but it wasn't frozen in these scenes. Should have been a comdy."
2,A great bad movie to watch to kill 90 minutes of your time!,"I think the movie editors forgot to go over the film after shooting. The movie contains numerous technical errors and cliche dialogue that you find in most action movies. However, the movie is so bad, it's funny! Treat Williams hardly shows any emotion playing his U.S. agent character. Some of the explosion scenes in the movie, especially one at the end, are pretty cool. Oh, and don't bother reading the storyline summary on the back of the video box because most of it is incorrect!"
5,A depressing but shockingly accurate glimpse of society,"The Stranger was an extremely thought provoking book, and it applies to every society at any time, thus is as powerful today in America as it was in France 50 years ago. Basically the book is about a man in Algiers who is killed by his society for his social abnormalities. He commited murder, but was executed for not crying at his mother's funeral. To me this book was a painful reflection of the mold that societies try to force people into, and the way the society views people who don't fit the mold. I felt this book was extremely powerful because of how it shows the cruelty that society can inflict to people who don't fit in."
3,Not as good as Gilbert's translation,"All that can be said in praise of this novel has been said on the page already in the other reviews. However, I think it needs to be addressed that this is the newer, ""americanized"" translation of the novel and, in my opinion, one would be better off sticking with the original Stuart Gilbert translation that was so satisfactory for so long. Ward's translation seems much too informal, in a tone that seems to ramble and not get across a mood fitting enough for Meursault's character. If at all possible, I recommend finding Gilbert's translation, as, in my opinion, it was much more enjoyable."
2,Short but boring,"The Stranger by Albert Camus is an interesting novel about Monsieur Meursalt, an ordinary man who goes through his mother's death, killing a man, and going to prison. I think this novel was fast-paced and easy to read, but it was not very exciting. I would not recommend reading The Stranger. I did not find it exhilerating. However, Albert Camus developed his characters very well. Overall, this book was boring, and I do not suggest reading it."
2,length was its only redemption,"any given tuesday of mine is more exciting than the protagonist's story. 'i went here. she said that. the car was red.' i don't understand how this book comes with such a reputation. to put it in reference, i also felt the same way about 'catcher in the rye', so if you enjoyed that type of pointlessness, read on. it's only redemption was its length."
1,Don't bother.,"I hated, hated, hated this book. It came highly recommended and I voluntarily (and rather enthusiastically) picked it up. There has never been a main character I have been more disgusted by, a storyline that has been less interesting, and a writing style that has been more obnoxious. I would burn it if it weren't borrowed."
1,wrong book,"They sent me the wrong book. It was The Berenstain Bears, Learn About Strangers, instead of The Stranger. It was disappointing!!"
2,David's thoughts,"The stranger is about a man who has no emotion and is indifferent to the world. In the beginning, the man's mother dies, and he doesn't show any feelings. Next, he meets a girl but won't tell her that he loves her. Later, the man kills an Arab on a beach and is put in prison. While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion. I also thought that there wasn't enough action and that the ending was pointless."
1,The Only Good Thing About It Is The Title & That Cure Song,"Being unnaturally obsessed with Kafka, it was assumed by my compadres that I would also like this author, and particularly this book. How wrong they were. The plot makes no sense, the characterization is meager & unconvincing, and the only poetic prose occurs on the last page as our hero (ha!) languishes in prison in the final hours before he is to be executed, wondering what it all means & railing at humanity for treating him like the dog he is."
3,Disturbing -- hence a useful introduction to existentialism,This book could be considered a bronze standard existentialist novel. You're unlikely to look at life quite the same way after reading it.
3,"not what i expected, but i liked it","if you want to discover exstitentialism or if you've ever been curious about camus, this is a good book to start off with...the story was interesting, even if the protagonist, wasn't worth my sympathy...i liked it..."
4,Makes you want to think...,"Personally, I had to read this book for an ENglish class that I needed to graduate with. A friend in telling me about the book implied that the guy was a selfish so and so, and when I read it, I felt that Mersault just didn't care one way or the other what he wanted.Just because he didn't cry at his own mother's funeral, they handed him a harsh sentence?? No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this. The guy had no goals, no ambitions, no nothing. He has a girl, but it don't mean a thing to him one way or the other. Does that make him amoral?? I feel it makes him irresponsible,unfeeling, and aimless."
5,I know nothing of existentialism,"I have never studied (or even once read about) existentialism and I read this book purely for pleasure. Without being in search of existentialist thought, like many frustrated students who gave this book a bad review may have been, I found it to be immensely well-written and simply a perfect little novel. Camus used fantastic sentence composition disguised by Meursault's (or perhaps translator Matthew Ward's) drollery while the simplicity of the events hid the absurdity of the story. I now consider the book a necessity of my own literary knowledge, especially being such a pleasantly quick read."
4,"A prelude to ""The Plague""?","I read with amusement the reviews of this novella. One fellow was uncomfortable with this story and gave it 4 stars though he said he hated it. I believe Camus would be pleased. Others said the story stayed with them long after finishing the book. Exactly. This is philosophy--not a murder mystery. The sheer economy of Camus' writing, the short, clipped sentence structure, and simple reliance on creating a setting to present a story reminded me of of a mythical cross between Hemingway and Poe. This story is not meant to be uplifting. It is been meant to make one consider the purpose of existence (existentialism). As for those who believe Camus was pessimistic about the purpose of human existence, read ""The Plague"". Read ""The Myth of Sisyphus"". Camus loved life and provides us all with a way to examine our purpose in a very simple and pure way."
3,A Vessel for Existentialism,"When I first read this novel I found that the plot of the story was less interesting, and less important than the personal philosophy of the main character, Meursault. Meursault has an indifferent approach to life, he does not believe in sustaining relationships, he indulges in the pleasures of relationships, only when it is convenient for him. One could define it as ""carpe diem"" but it seems not to be completely accurate with Meursault. Anyway, the plot should not have been the vessel for the man's personal philosophy, that is my only qualm with this book."
3,The answer is in the question.,"Many readers ackowledge the quality of Camus' writing but question the truth of existentialist philosophy. Maybe this is because existentialism is approached by some as they might approach a theology: as a description of the absolute truth of existence or even a prescription for how one should live.As a devout Christian, I find these works to be valuable illustrations of what happens to the person who cannot transcend his neuroses via spiritual catharsis (see C.S. Lewis for such remedies). The best lessons are learned from reflecting on ideas we find adverse to our own.The thoughtful reader must find Marsault to be a singularly unpitiable character. One of many object lessons I take from The Stranger is that to be preoccupied with oneself is to place one's soul in peril. Its a sad story that perhaps could have been told with more depth if Camus were more novelist and less philosopher. A good book; I would buy it again."
4,excellent new translation.,"It has been ten years since I read ""The Stranger. I am quite pleased with the new version. I must admit that the early translation did not live up to the principles of existentialism. This new version does. It is enriching to read. This book must be read at least once every ten years; as a good reminder of how we place value on things in life and life itself. A last note, in order to make the reading more enriching, a little search into Camus' political interest is worthwhile. If this is done, the symbolic language, such as the blistering sun, and the fact that it is an arab that is shot in Algiers, become clear in his writing."
2,English wouldn't do it JUSTICE.,"Albert Camus has been the man behind the amazing popularity of this book. Because of the disillusionment during the war, the characterization of Mersault is one of no emotions or sentiments. While studying French, we had the chance to read and explore the language and its syntax, as well as the story and the theme of the ""absurde"". Personally, the English version of this book does no justice to Albert Camus's impeccable style of description, or lack thereof. The precision of French is lost in the translation to muddled English words. The story comes off as one of plain repitition with no purpose, and the story becomes, at once, dull and unimaginative.Frankly, I hated it. Every single bit of it. And I recommend that anyone with the knowledge of the French language ought to try it in French rather than English."
4,Good read,Definitely a good book and worthwhile read. I recommend it and it is not too long for those who do not like lengthy stories.
2,Not the Better Translation,"The Matthew Ward translation is inferior to the translation by Stuart Gilbert. Using the French ""Maman"" does nothing for the reader of English and, in fact, detracts from the quality of the reading experience. Compare the last several lines of the two translations, and you will find Gilbert's much more powerful, even lyrical. When I first read Camus' book, which is my favorite novel, only the Gilbert translation was available, and it blew me away. When the new improved version came out, I read it and tossed it in the trash. Gilbert, however, makes Camus' lines sing with electricity. If you can get the older translation, do so."
4,"Good book, but below my expectations","""the stranger"" is OK, more, a great novel. However, i expected more form a nobel prize. In a book labeled as ""existentialist"", (as this one) the book quality is strongly related to the personality of the main character. That's beacuse most of the book is composed by thoughts of the protagonist or his feelings towards somebody or something. Meursault (this book's main character) is complex and interesting, however, in my opinion is far from reaching the deepness of other famous characters such as Dostoievsky's Raskolnikov; Hesse's: Emil Sinclair or Harry Heller; or even the one from Sabato's ""the tunnel"". Meursault is portrayed as somebody who doesn't have much feelings towards anybody or anything. Inside him there are no internal conflicts or doubts or questions about something. That's Ok, Camus makes it interesting anyway...Good book, definetely worth reading, but forgetable in some degree."
5,An Undesputed Classic,"I read the Stranger (actually i read the translation entitled The Outsider, but it's the same thing) in my grade 11 world literature class. The book revolves around the main character named Meursault. The novel, deep rooted in its existentialist theme, is one of the most mentally stimulating books you will ever read. Albert Camus suggests that the pinnacle of hypocrisy in society is its quickness to judge people upon appearances or behavior, versus its apparent incapacity to judge people upon fact. I will refrain from making any conjectures about the novel, its theme and message, because that is something you must do for yourself. After reading the novel, dont rush to the internet to read essays and reviews about the novel. Instead spend some time contemplating the book yourself. Then open yourself to the opinions of others. It is one of those books that you will never forget, and will change the way you see things, at least temporarly."
5,Subtle and engaging,"This book certainly rings as true today as it did when it first came out, as our society produces more and more non-heroes like this, dulled to most everything. An important work of modern literature."
5,Excellent Story Line!!,This Book was very interesting and kept my apt attention. At points I could not put this book down. I would recommend this book to many people.
3,Juh?,"This bizarre little novel was recently named one of the 100 best of the century. If there were (a la Ayn Rand) some philosophical speeches, perhaps this could be redeemed, but it is very difficult to find sympathy with a murderer, even one condemned for the wrong reasons."
3,"An interesting idea, but Meursault deserves no sympathy...","Camus has a point to make in this book, but sometimes he makes it hard to find. True, it is unfair to judge a man because he fails to live up to societal standards and not because of the crime he commits. The fact remains, though, that Meursault DOES commit murder. That he does so for no particular reason (the sun gets in his eyes?)only makes the act more unthinkable. Shouldn't we be more afraid of a man who kills another man randomly than one who does so with some sort of motivation?Since the book is written in the first person, Camus obviously intended for this story to come across as the oft-told tale of the ordinary man caught up in a world gone mad. However, I came away from this book with the impression that Meursault was the one who was mad. Or perhaps he was simply autistic. Either way, he neither understands the system nor operates within it, and it is this failure that causes his downfall, not society."
4,read it for your own reaction.,"This novel is absurd. This is not arguable. The point of this novel is that you react to it -- you see Meursault and his absurd way of going about life, and you feel the need to change your own."
3,Uncertainty,"It has been over 50 years since I read The Stranger, and having read much about Camus recently, I decided to re-read some of his works that are now seen as classics. The descriptions of the life of the French colony in pre-WW11 Algeria are interesting pictures of a way of life that is no more. The plot, if it can be called that, is the tale of a man's anomie or estrangement from society leading to his death. It raises philosophic questions, but I don't know that those questions are seen as being as pressing today as they were in the post-war period. As a warning about the effects of indifference or detachment is is an almost a polemic. Had the ""hero"" shown more concern for his fate and been a bit more engaged, the text would have shown less inevitability and more complexity.If you are looking a book to provoke thought rather than entertain, this is well worth reading."
5,Excellent book.,I had somehow gotten the idea that Camus' writing would be beyond me. I can happily say that I found this book to be an excellent read. I prefer to get hardcover books over paperbacks. This Everyman Library edition has become A welcome addition to my library.
3,Not For Everyone,"If you are into post-modernist rambling, then this is the book for you. It's a classic in that genre and should be respected as such. However, if you are into interesting stories that have a plot and well-developed characters, then avoid Camus."
3,i liked it somewhat,i was forced to read this book in my english class i thought that it was pathetic and boring. meursault(we refer to him as Mo) is a real loser. this book is dumb and i recommend that nobody ever reads it
1,A horrible translation,"I have read a previous translation of The Stranger, and was deeply moved. My entire life was changed. The previous translator did Camus justice. Matthew Ward, with this translation of The Stranger, ruined the novel. Ward includes awful cliche and unintelligent description. Unfortunately this is the only translation currently in print in the US. If you are able to, please order from a forgein printer (sometimes printed under the title The Outsider) or consider searching for an out of print copy not translated by Matthew Ward."
4,Let's all embrace the blissful void,"Camus dropped the bomb on me with this piece. With a crisp clean prose my beloved Camus showed me what it is to feel the void, the absurdity, and triumph over it. So for those tormented souls out there, this book's for you."
2,The Stranger,"Personally, I didn't think this book was very good. The whole concept of writing a book about a faceless man just doesn't appeal to me. I know that all of Camus books are strange but this one just wasn't one of his better books. The book just didn't have enough going on in it. The entire book was about the faceless man killing someone and then getting executed. I think the book probably would hae been more interesting if maybe the man fell in love before the execution. It also would have been better if at the end of the book, he actually wrote about the execution instead of just letting us hang, not knowing about what happens at his executon. The exection probably would have made the book alot more exciting too. So if I were you I probably wouldn't read the book unless you are into really wierd, boring books."
4,"short but sweet, for the person reading the story anyway","growing up, my last name was frequently misspelled as the author's last name. after 31yrs (no age jokes please), i figured it was time to read a piece penned by a man with whom i share many consonants and a vowel. i was not disappointed. mr. camus' story is easy to read and moves quickly (it's only 123 pages). mr. meursault is a man who seems to live his life on an even keel. he rarely feels or shows any emotion and other people find this odd. he seems indifferent when: his mother dies; his neighbor beats a woman in the apartment downstairs; his other neighbor abuses his dog; the woman in his life proclaims her love; the incident which lands him in trouble; and the subsequent debt he owes to society. the lack of passion and compassion in his psyche makes it impossible for people to understand his actions in the incident which lead to his trial. there is more to this but i won't spoil the ending for you."
4,Damn...my face is falling off...,"This book was nuts. This guy was so cold hearted and completly...a strager...even to his friends. He was so cold that it almost even made to this book boring. I mean, somtimes I would be reading and I would notice that I was board, but I wanted to read more. I cant explain it, but this book was amazing! READ THIS BOOK!"
2,Honors English required,"This book was required reading for my son's HS senior honors english course. He found it quite laborious to read and didn't like it - but it was required, so what can you do? DO not recommend for casual reading, but it's a great price if your child has to have it for school"
1,Wrong Cover and Translator,"I purchased this thinking it to be the american translation because the cover was the same. The cover of the book sent to me is very different and it is in fact the british translation not the american. I need the american one for my english class, now I'm stuck with a book I cannot use."
5,political slant,"Camus' character, Meursault, commits a senseless murder and is executed for it. A Camus fantasy? Or would a white man really have been executed for killing an Arab (Moor)in N. Africa during what I presume was the late 1930s? The book first appeared in 1942. Had the setting been the USA during the same period, Meursault would've probably never even gone to trial. Maybe this says something about the difference between the colonialists and the racist slave holders in the USA."
4,Nicely Written,"I found this book to be interesting. The main charater, Meursault, seemed so apathetic about life, I had to continue reading. But his apathy was very suffocating to the reader. I found the direction of the book odd; the outcome was definitely not what I expected. I suppose that some of the writing probably would have sounded different if it was in the original French. Overall, I think the story was well written and well developed."
2,There is better existentialism to be found.,"I feel compelled, on behalf of all of those interested in existentialism, to add my threnodic voice to all the other numerous and predominantly ebullient reviews of Albert Camus' *The Stranger*. As. I have stated in my summary, there is better existentialism to be found. If I wished to be rude, I would say that Albert Camus is just a Dostoyevskiy/Kafka 'wannabe'. I do not so wish it, so I will merely state that this book does not suffice to place him in the same catagory as those masters. If you really enjoyed Stranger, then *Crime and Punishment* will blow you out of the water."
3,good book,"A good book. Sometimes Mersault seems so cold, but I can't help but have sympathy for the guy. One idea I liked is, is our existence based on who we see ourselves to be, or by how others view us? Sadly, Mersault was judged and condemned for who people thought he was. Maybe this should open our eyes to be more understanding of the people around us. Anyways, it's an OK book, and I'd recommend it."
5,An amazing and powerful piece of literature.,"The magic Camus works with this novel is not entirely within the plot nor the ending, but rather in the cumulative emotional effect. Its funny to read some of the other reviews, calling it ""too depressing"" or ""odd."" This isn't a trashy dime novel to be taken on the same intellectual plain as Danielle Steele or Olive Ann Burns, but rather a serious philosophical work in the style of Derrida or Sartre. If you liked this, try Derrida's The Postcards."
3,The Stranger: Outsider or Weirdo?,"I am being forced to read L'etranger in High School. I am in French Immersion so we have to read it in it's original French text. Let me tell you one thing about Albert Camus: he was definately a genius. Let me tell you another thing: Meursault is not a genius. I agree, he doesn't ""play the game"" well, but doesn't he eventually learn how to play? It's a psychological masterpiece but it's not for your every-day-Joe. John-Henry-next-door probably won't appreciate Albert, but your brainiac second cousin might eat it up. Check it out, decide for yourself."
3,what Camus himself said about The Stranger,"A lot of people are confused and have wrong notions about what The stranger is about, here's what Camus himself said about it, and is in my opinion the best explanation, ""...the hero of the book is condemnd because he doesn't play the game. In this sense, he is an outsider to the society in which he lives...you must ask yourself in what way Meursault doesn't play the game. The answer is simple: he refuses to lie. Lying is not only saying what isn't true. It is also, in fact especially, saying more than is true and, in the case of the human heart, saying more than one feels. We all do it, everyday to make life simpler. But, contrary to appearences, Meursault doesn't wnat to make life simpler. He says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings and society immediately feels threatened.""Albert Camus, January 8 1955"
3,A Very Good Book Help Us to Think!!!,An honest human being who is responsible for his social role and being executed for unwilling to accept any pre-defined social values that he doesn't believe. A good book for any real human beings. We are not able to and have no right to judge the moral issue in this book. But we have to think about life honestly when facing ourselves. Something exists with thoughts alone and nothing to do with any sensation or materials. This book definitely helps us to think.Those people who contempts this book have no serious thoughts about the real life and real value. It's not much difference of they never read this book.
3,The Stranger is a fast and thought-provoking read.,"Camus' novel is built around a very interesting man, M. Mersault. His philosophy in life is probably very different from the reader's, but the fact that he hangs on to this philosophy through all his trials and tribulations forces the reader to seriously consider his way of life, its advantages and its disadvantages. The book is short enough to be fairly entertaining, and the plot easily draws the reader into the ""stranger's"" life. Try it, especially if you are looking for some food for thought."
3,An existential novel of average quality.,"This book is exremely well written. The language is descriptive and the words are chosen with care and knowledge. Lines like th end of part one where he describes his shooting a gun as the loud rapping ""of fate at the door of my undoing."" You can't beat stuff like that. But as existential novels go, it is not the best, yet it is one of Camus' better works. It took me two hours to read the entire book, but I am still thinking about it."
4,Correction of Editorial review...,L'Étranger was written and first published in 1942 (in French). 1946 was the year of publishing the first English translation by Stuart Gilbert (who despite his French-sounding last name was a British author) - The second English translation was undertaken by Joseph Laredo and published in 1982. - In a very different style. This is the third translation By Matthew Warde... It would be interesting to read all three versions and debate whose version gives back Camus's words the best....From what I hear it'd worth the time and effort.
3,"""All Men Believe In God, Even Those Who Reject Him""","Camus could sweep through a volume of philosophy with one razor edged sentence.I may not agree with all his perspectves, but I do give him the credit of genius.This september (not january) 1954 'Vintage Books' edition has gained a collectors cult following (If only for the haunting cover). But the reason escapes me. certainly the disaffected void hangs heavily throughout this story. It's unrelenting grip of dread holds the reader tightly. But personally I feel this translation lacks the true Camus ambience."
4,An interesting read...,"The Stranger was an interesting book that addressed many ethical and human issues regardless of it's brief nature. Meursault, he main character is attacked by the very society that created him. He's a man accused of reacting and not reacting. As a reader, you have a strong emotional understanding or a man who reacts to the world without a ""normal"" emotional response. Overall, I recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a book that confronts human nature from many angles."
3,Some Poetry,"This book is interesting in spots. Its portrait of a disaffected ""outsider"" whose emotional responses are shallow, whose sense of morality works against self-interest, and who focuses on trivia seems to have influenced other writers and works (I'm thinking ""American Psycho"" and ""Catcher in the Rye"", particularly).The sequences about the old man and his dog are the strongest, very poetic. The whole portion around those dealing with the protagonist's last days of freedom are evocative and well-written. The rest slows down. I think that I understand Camus' intentions and subtext, and they're interesting, but the book is hit-or-miss."
4,"Quick read, worthwhile, thought-provoking","This was a novel I purchased for my English class.We were instructed to choose one of nine different perspectives to read from, I was assigned sadness.This novel encompasses many more different aspects, but from the view I had taken, this proved to be a great novel with the contemporary spin on religion and how the human conscience adapts to prevail over everyday struggle. I greatly enjoyed reading it, about a two hour straight through session of reading! Very worthwhile."
3,Very strange,"This book is very strange, since it tells a series of terrible events that change the life of a man forever. However, it is not the events that make the book, but the reactions and thoughts the different characters have.The main character, Mersault is simply intriguing... you learn about his life, his thoughts, his feelings... and yet, you know nothing at all... in my opinion, he is one of those characters that grows on you and in some instances you can even feel identified with him, but in the end he is a Stranger whom you dont understand.The plot itself is not very interesting, and it is a bit depressing, starting with a funeral and then moving on to a murder and finally a trail and life in jail... still it keeps you reading... I know, it is hard to explain, and I guess that is exactly what has made this book a classic, it is impossible to categorize, analyze or even try to make sense of it.... but it is also impossible to put it down."
1,Disappointing,"I'll keep this short. The book was an awful read save the last ten pages. Everything before that is terribly uninteresting. It is only once he has been sentenced and awaits his end that it becomes something worth flipping through. I have the utmost respect for Albert Camus, but this is dribble."
1,Confusing and Contradictory,"Okay, I have read, analyzed, and written an 11- page paper on this book, and I don't have good things to say about it. The critics say it is a brilliant insight on the personality of the absurd, and they believe that Camus is amazing. Please. Camus could not decide what kind of character he wanted Meusault to be. One minute M. didn't care about anything, while the next he was absorbed in Marie's smile. I did not find the book insightful at all, and I honestly feel it is a waste of time to try to find deep meaning in it."
1,"Terrible Existentalistic Trash! Ugh,worst book EVER.","Camus'little novel about a nihilistic nobody who sheds no tears over the death of his haggy old mother, does boring things and commits a murder. That's the plot. Gee, I hated this book. Hated it. The main character's behaviour and atheistic beliefs slightly offended me. Don't waste your time on this. Read Ionesco's 'Four Plays' instead. Then again, I might be wrong. After all, a critic's review is based solely upon his or hers personal opinion. It could be a wonderful novel, but not bloody likely. All I know is that at the end I was glad to see the malicous little bugger executed."
1,This is a book for losers!!,"I hate this book, though I understand why this book became so popular. We, humans, are not logical machines. I think anyone who have read any of Nietzsche's books would think this book childish and absurd."
1,Used it as kitty-litter for my cat,"This book was bad. I read this book when I was in grade 10 and it was very depressing. I probably was not old enought to appreciate the book or the content in it but i was aware of how i felt after reading it and wanted to burn it.The book presents the main character as a person with no heart, no faith and nothing (and no one) to believe in. Sounds like a great book right? Its unfortunate the Albert C does not have any faith in the human race."
1,The philsophy of old,"::yawn:: Here is your plot. The main character doesn't care about anything, about himself the world or other people. And in the end and instead of defending himself (and he is 100% innocent) he chooses to die instead. Wow what a real hero, a true life that we should all imitate. I'll put it in simple words, IT'S STUPID. Don't buy this piece of junk, I had to read it for High School and I think it's garbage. The main character is simply, a moron. Wow how philsophical and interesting. Not to mention it's translated poorly from the French language."
4,It all depends on what you want from the book...,"I have read this book at least four different times ever since I was 15 -for the record, I am 34 as I write this review. When I read it the first time, I just wanted people to think I was smart since I was reading Camus.Time went by, and I found myself reading this book again and coming to the conclusion that it is neither really about the murder (that became a song from the Cure later on, if nobody has written that yet), nor the stranger, nor his trial.The book can be interpreted as an allegory to the European presence in Africa. If your heart is socialist enough, you can interpret it as an allegory of the European arrogant presence everywhere in the World.In my view, it is not his best work (I like The Fall much better) but it is a must, no questions asked."
2,Don't waste your money,One of the worst books I have ever read. I don't know why anybody would want to read a book about a person who is bored....
2,What is the big deal,"What is the big deal? I read this book because a college age acquaintance had mentioned it was on a required reading list for one of his classes. In researching the book I found it is high on the list of existential writings. I got nothing out of it other than perhaps how empty existentialism is. No wonder students drop out of college and feel they are wasting their money. America is producing some fabulous literature yet there is an old guard that clings to all that is bleak in life. May I recommend Victor Frankle’s Man’s Search for Meaning? This is a much better and true account of the human spirit and what it can accomplish. If you have to read this to in class to placate the instructor do so but do not hesitate to counter with truth, hope and optimism and do not accept this as real life."
1,This book has DRM,"I am afraid that, as much as I love the book, I do not appreciate the limitations put upon this particular edition (Kindle) by way of DRM. How much of a problem DRM is, may vary from user to user, but I would have appreciated it if Amazon had informed me about it in advance of my purchase, as I would then have chosen a different edition (hardcover) where I OWN the book and not merely LEASE it."
5,A Horrid Book Everyone Should Read!,"Albert Camus superbly takes us through the thoughts of a Godless heathen; A Nihilist. The author shows us the husk of a man. A hollow being who cares for nothing except his selfish desires. Our protagonist (and I use that label lightly) does not love his mother, whom he just days ago buried. Does not care, and looks on as his acquaintance beats his ex-girlfriend. He also does not care of the consequences or immorality of roaming the beach in search of someone to kill. He is mildly interested in sex. However, the woman whom he shares a bed with is viewed only as a means to the eventual end of satisfy his base needs. The main character is naive, loathsome individual whom everyone who reads this book should take great strength and pains never to be."
4,goth background research,"""and the stranger - the killing of an arab""It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus, in high school, I thought I was an existentialist.This story is really interesting and a great book to read if you're at all into the Cure - it's like adding some street cred or something - not really, but I feel somehow more orderly by having read it.It's short, easy to read and gives an interesting view of life - it is written by quite a well known (ie. accessible) philosopher after all. One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music."
5,Appeals to some and not to others,"My dad likes Albert Camus and my mom doesn't. I'm going to side with my dad on this one.One can debate the merits and demerits of the philosophy of the ""absurd"", and how well this books expostulates it. I think this book is great way to look at life because it creates the idea of an unexplainable phenomenon/na and illustrates it at a level that is easy to understand.Humans being rational often, if not always, look for explanations within dimensions and perspectives they can understand. In the course of living this is often possible, and sometimes not. I think this books takes this idea and illustrates eloquently and pithily, which is why I like it."
1,Confusing and Depresing,I had to read this book for a test I am having in Honors English tomorrow. The book made no sense and was all out depressing. I don't know why anybody would want to read it let alone deem it as a classic.
1,Just Terrible,"I'm sure that I'm missising something here. Or maybe all of the people who wrote their glowing reviews of this book are missing something, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was like a Junior High School student trying to write their first story. Really more than just a list of sequential events like, I woke up, I went to work, I went to bed. I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself. The only saving grace was that it was such a short book that I was able to read it in about two hours. I know that Camus is well respected and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, but based on this book I can't understand or imagine why."
1,SO overrated,"This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence."
1,terrible,why are we forced to read this GARBAGE in high school? this book was terrible. i really felt like jumping in the book and slappin' that guy around a bit. how could he just act like that? UGH!
1,Pardon me while I indulge in a moment of shallowness...,"This book really, really sucks.It doesn't even DESERVE a more in-depth review. UGH."
4,Literary Classic,"Literary Classic. It is a rare that any book you have to read for school and that has been translated can be such a fast pace, thrilling read. Camus pens a literary masterpiece that is really one of the early phsycological thrillers. This is a must read."
2,A quick read!,"This is one of those books that you come across in your life that people talk about and mention to you a few times and eventually you get around to reading it. Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read. The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details. That didn't bother me so much. The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character. If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different. Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still. I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well."
3,"In my book, not a classic, but not bad","I, myself, did not like this book but I can see where others would. It's deep and thought provoking. However, I think people try to read a bit too much into it and it clouds a lot of the simplistic and obvious symbolism. It is not exactly edge of your seat. In fact, it's rather dull and predictable as a rising action/climax/resolution novel but it is quite philosophical."
4,Not existentialist - depressed!,"I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had."
5,An amazing piece of literature,"Camus is brilliant. I've read this book 4 times, and only after taking a course in existentialism have I realized it's full importance."
3,"Great book, atrocious new translation","This powerful, disturbing book was better served by the eccentric translation English readers were used to than it is by this parched new one.There are passages where this translator is so literal, he literally takes the French grammatical structure and dumps it into English with no filter, when rearrangement would actually make the point better. You just want to strangle him sometimes. He took a fine wine and turned it into a raisin.--And no, it doesn't read like that in the original French."
2,Only read it if it's assigned schoolwork,"I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book. Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles. You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence. The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book).As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way. The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book. If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense."
2,often-boring book about heartless people,"The characters in this book make my skin crawl. Salamano beats his dog, Raymond beats his mistress, Meursault kills a man for no reason, and then a bunch of stupid court officials try Meursault for his character instead of his crime. Meaursault himself seems psychopathic. As someone who has been diagnosed with moderate recurrent depression, I have felt miserable for long periods of time, tried to disengage from life, and believed that existence has no meaning. A lot of people have had these thoughts, because life is cruel and unfair. And yet, unlike Meaursault, we haven't killed anyone.Maybe if it were the first existensialism I'd ever read, I would have been impressed. As it is, I just think The Stranger is a bleak book about a bunch of terrible people."
2,Not very interesting...,"The book is very short and very simplistic; I felt that not Camus, but the one who translated it did not do a good job. It is a bit confusing because Meursault starts out as not caring about anything, but then he seems so infatuated with Marie. So it was a bit hard to decide what kind of character Meursault was supposed to be, although it does in a way show us that humans are not logical beings. On the intellectual level this book was not very appealing at all; most of Meursault's experiences were generalized. I have to say that the book only gets interesting in the last 20-30 pages, that is where the action starts to happen. Everything else before that is vague and garbage, it only talks about this guy who does not have feelings, but wait he does have feelings, or maybe he doesn't. If I were you, I would save the time and read another more interesting book."
2,The Book was alright.,"I think this book was not amuzing in any such way. It made me feel disgust for the narrator. Especially with the fact that the story begins with ""Mama died today- or maybe yesterday."" Through out the whole novel he does things that are not humane and his actions are presentable. Even though this book is short and not detailed I think there was more meaning behind it though."
3,If you are doing A-Levels - I suggest you read on.......,"OK, listen all you guys. I've read this novel in french and let me tell you - it isn't all that fun. I appreciate Camus' genius in writing such a fulfilling plot - if you like that sort of thing. If you want to make reference to another novel in any of your essays or you wish to read another book that's quite similar but, if I may add, not quite as good, read Mauriac's ""Therese Desqueyroux"". It's much more complicated but still worthwhile. Anyway, back to old Camus. I used to be really interested in reading French literature until I found Camus. It's all together quite daunting now. So, if you are intending to read this book as a form of leisure, I suggest getting your hands on a translation. GOOD LUCK! Oh and by the way, if anyone could offer me a second-hand copy of any translation of l'Etranger I'd be extremely grateful. Cheers folks! HAPPY READING!!"
4,Only cause is Camus i will not give him 5 stars....,"Yeah, i have a great prejuice against Camus to deny this book the 5 stars. The book is brilliant, it describes in my concept a caracter without psycology. Its a guy that lost his hope and faith in the world ( i don't know the reasons) and that acts mechanically always. He is incapable of having a behavior practically, cause a behavior implies a psycological background. In fact Mersault is an ideal character cause a human being could never be mechanicall as Mersault is. I will not imagine why Camus wrote the novel, but Mersault, as a carcater lacking of humanity, show us exactly what we are, the biased of our perceptions and predjuices ( which is usually represented in a moral standard). I must apologize for my english, i am from Colombia."
2,Confusingly simplistic,"This is another selection assigned to high school students which seems to be a part of the common theme of examining the inner self and its struggle between good and evil. The Stranger has a Stephen King flavor to it when it comes to the main character, Meursalt. Meursalt has no feelings for anything or anyone. At his mother's funeral, he is a blank slate. His nonchalant response is to everything is basically 'I guess'. Then he is put on trial for murder. This lack if feeling for anything continues, even as he heads to the guillotine. I am confused why this is such an important read, but it is still assigned. Camus' style is overly simplistic and repetitive to the point of annoyance. It is not the worst book I have ever read, but I question its value even to high school students who probably won't catch whatever Camus is attempting to say."
4,Makes you think,"I had to read this book in French, and while many students copped out and bought the English version, I still read the French. That being said, I must say that this book for all its insights is amazing. The philosophy of Mersault is to be looked on more than the events that take place, since one is a result of the other. I found his ca m'était égal ( It's all the same to me) that is repeated throughout the novel to be eerie and fascinating at the same time. This book is not for people who reads fluff. It is about looking at an idea of living and trying to understand it. You may not necessarily agree with it, but you can understand it. I am now reading Le Mythe de Sisyphe in French and plan to read Le Peste. If you don't think and you don't like to think, do not read this book. Once you have read this book though and you understand it, you will want to read more of Camus. I even found some of his short stories quite fascinating ( though read in English)."
5,One of the best books ever written.,"I was told by a really good friend of mine to read this book. Looking in a bookstore on vacation, I came across it. It was cheap so I bought it, not really knowing anything about the story or what I was getting into. But I trust my friend's judgment, so I went ahead and read all of 'The Stranger' this afternoon. WOW is all I can say. The language and storytelling is so simple, so effective, that I got wrapped up in the world that Camus was engaging me in.It reads like Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye', at least in my opinion. He tells the story so clearly. It's one of the most concise books I've ever read. It is quite depressing, but you oddly feel sorry for, and relate to the main character. I feel an odd sense of hope after reading it, and for people that hated it, I can't see what they're talking about. The story will engulf you and not let go until the end. Highly recommended!"
3,odd....,"I liked this story it was great, but the writing was weird and did not flow well. I felt like it jumped alot and I feel like I missed so much. Could have been done better but maybe it's her first books."
5,AMAZING,"This is an amazing book and I would highly recommend to anyone who loves a great fantasy! I just picked this book up at the library and before I knew it, I couldn't put it down. I got very attached to the characters and could literally feel what they were going through. I just have to say again what a wonderful book this was!"
1,A story skimmed off the top,"I was so disappointed after reading this trilogy. The idea of the story itself was what attracted me in the first place. I found the alternating points of view extremely annoying. Because the focus changes from one character to another so quickly, I felt I was only skimming the top of the story. I was also disappointed at how the story ended. She just left the characters hanging at the end of the battle. What happend to their future? I don't recommend this trilogy."
4,Surprisingly good,"A friend referred me to this book and to be honest it took me a little while to get into it. I actually almost gave up, but my friend insisted and I am glad she did because I really enjoyed this book and the whole series.The story is told from two characters points of view ( a teenage boy and a teenage girl). It is a fantasy book, but part of it is set in our world, giving it a fun balance of real and fantasy.I thought this book to be very original and the characters likable. Though I wouldn't call the pace fast, I would say the book is definitely intriguing and worth buying as it is one of those books you want to read over and over again."
5,"Wonderful read, neat characters, made me want to visit.","I read this book when I was 9 years old, I recommend this book for my nieces and nephew. Henry Reed is an interesting and enterprising character with many adventures to share."
2,Didn't work,It didn't work on my Windows Vista laptop. There seems to be some compatibility problems. I can't find any alternate too.
3,great content but not easy to handle,"Having all the definitions in one book is really handy. But it ends up being a heavy one to lift, little font to read, very fine pages to grab and turn and a quite austere approach to vobulary. Illustrations are not numerous and are in black and white. I miss so much the glossy pages, color illlustration, and user friendliness of Larousse dictionaries that I used in French. It was a pleasure to learn the dictionary by heart. This was ardeous and done to address need. It is functional but lacks the fanciness that makes searching and reading fun besides useful."
3,Exhaustive in 1961 - 50 years out of date.,"I bought this dictionary because my collage courses were using words which weren't in my (Webster's) collegiate dictionary - and it has been great for what I bought it for.It is not nearly up to date. It was published in 1961, and the next edition (W4) is a current project started in 2008 (according to Wikipedia). There are many words which you just won't find in it because they are new or technical. For an ""exhaustive"" dictionary, this is inexcusable. BTW: You won't find many of those missing words in the Addenda section in the front."
2,A Disappointment,"A lot of words defined here, but still not complete. Mine is the 2003 V3.0 version and it does finally include ""internet"" -- but don't bother looking for ""blog"" as it is not there. Could the etymologies and histories be more complete? Yes. Other criticisms I read of this CD are also on the mark, as, for example, the absence of many of the print-version illustrations.There are a lot of search options that could be helpful. One of these claims to find homophones (homonyms). This version will find neither ""bow"" for ""bough"" nor ""ruff"" for ""rough"".Still a useful item for many purposes, but complete or unabridged it's not."
4,Good CD dictionary that can be better,"This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version, this is not a problem. When looking up a word, I cannot tell if it is from the original or from the new word list.I do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the CD. If it uses too much hard disk space, it can be made available from CD, as Random House did. No pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound."
2,This Review Is For CD ROM Only NOT THE BOOK,"The CD-Rom is very disappointing. The graphics look like early 90's graphics, the font has no ability to be adjusted to a larger size, and the sentences are all bunched together making it difficult to read. It's as if they just scanned the W3 into a software format and decided to sell it with absolutely no modifications. The developers should take a hint from Encarta's Dictionary format. And all this for $49.95. Oh, and if you've got Webster's Collegiate Ed. installed, (on Windows XP) you cannot install the W3 alongside of it (I wanted to do this to compare definitions). It's either one or the other.Some additional improvements would be a pronunciation guide (the kind that you click on the word and it pronounces the word out loud), as well as a feature to hide archaic or obsolete definitions of a word."
1,No support for low screen res,"The interface may be horrific or it may be brilliant; either way, I wouldn't know as that I am running on a laptop with a vertical resolution of 480 dpi. When running at this resolution, the bottom of the dialogue boxes are chopped off - scroll bars, lists of words, et al - instead of resizing as would be expected of even a sub-par user interface.And tech-support's response to my dilemma? Increase your resolution. Sorry, it's a laptop with a fixed resolution; not an option. Guess I'm stuck with Encarta's less-than-inspiring definitions of words."
2,strange dictionary,"Were it not for the immediate remedy and response from the seller, there would be no stars at all for this item. The pages were bound out of order in sections and some pages were missing. Hopefully the seller was able to correct this problem."
3,Dictionary,"This dictionary software is adequate. I do a lot of reading while traveling and I frequently need access to an unabridged dictionary. It works fairly well and I leave it up on my laptop while reading a book. I have found some words where the word itself is used as the definition for that word. To my understanding that is a NO-NO for a dictionary, however, I did not find any competing unabridged dictionary software."
3,It's surprising that the sound / pronunciation is missing and the CD-ROM is an Old version,"We are surprised that the CD-ROM that comes with this dictionary is an old version. Also, it is highly desirable that there should be sound available in the CD-ROM so that kids can learn correct pronunciation. Also, isn't it the time that Merriam Websters publishes a new edition for this as this version is already too old?Any one from Merriam Webster's customer services watches these comments to address them?Other than these short comings, I highly recommend this dictionary - as it is single source for most of the words that one comes across.Arun"
4,Superb BUT....,"Webster's 3rd New International Unabridged is indeed a ""must-have"", _but_ it is likewise desperately in need of a major revision, i.e., a *4th edition*.I own the three-volume version of the 3rd Edition purchased through Encyclopaedia Britannica in the mid-'60's. Besides the basic Merriam-Webster 3rd Unabridged contents, it features a very useful ""seven-language dictionary"". I wish that the greatly-needed revision of the 3rd New International will include a revision for the version that I have.Hope springs eternal, as the adage goes."
5,In response to Scott Eliason,"Hi, Scott! Listen, the latest edition always has an earlier date but in this case, as in previous printings, at the beginning there is an addenda including 18,000 new words or new meanings to words already included. This may seem unsuitable, but just think that by leafing through the addenda you get to learn about the new language of the last 10 years!"
3,"Good Dictionary, Outdated CD Rom","The dictionary is the authoritative text for American English. The CD ROM, however was outdated and did not run on Windows XP--thus worthless to me."
1,"Who, Which, Where??","There have been more than dozen productions of this piece made available on LP/tape/CD. Which one is this?? If it's the most recent London revival, it's lame. If it's the New York original cast with Elly Stone, it's priceless.What have we here??"
4,A nice novelty item,"This item arrived within the projected delivery window. The shirt looks good. I would've liked for the graphic to have been bigger considering I bought a XXL, but it was straight and centered. I dig it for its novelty and will wear it as a proud and loyal Bears fan!"
2,SNL Da Bear's T-Shirts,"I purchased two of these shirts for my father and my brother as part of their Christmas gifts. We are all Chicago Bear Fans and we all enjoyed the famous SNL skits about ""Da Bears.""However, the shirts proved a disappointment as the quality was not there in the silk screening of the image (poor image quality and the print was crooked on one shirt). The lack of quality extended to the shirt material (burlap comes to mind). The manufacturer/vendor was simply out to make some fast money."
3,"It's a great design, but runs small!","I purchased this shirt for my boyfriend who's a huge Chicago Bears fan. He also loves SNL & this shirt was perfect for him. It arrived within 5 days instead of the standard 7-10 business days. I was disappointed in the size of the shirt. My boyfriend typically wears a Medium, but the shirt is a preshrunk shirt so I would recommend people to buy the next larger size than usual. Overall, it's a great shirt & I would recommend this shirt to any Chicago Bears fan!!"
3,To Die For,"Was very surprised & to be honest not a very good film in my opinion. This was the early years of Nicole Kidman as she is very young in this film. Plot was not that great, but if you are her fan/s she can do now wrong."
2,Well.......,"Nicole Kidman is a good actress. I actually liked her before I saw this movie. Depressing story, depressing scenery, unlikable characters. Enough said."
2,Can't think of a good thing to say about it,"I've seen it on VHS, I'd heard that it was rated highly, can't think of anything good to say about it. I didn't like ANY of the characters, maybe they all needed to be knocked off,not just Nicole Kidman's news woman. Thoroughly unpleasant movie, Nicole Kidman is better in The Peacemaker with George Clooney, Joaquin Phoenix is better in Gladiator, save your money don't get this one."
1,Big Fat Waste of Time!,"As a big fan of Nicole, I was pretty disgusted with this movie. It was so corny in dialogue and content I had a hard time staying interested, but did because it was so bad, I had to see what happened. And that affair with her student was so dusgusting! The ending was hardly entertaining, and I wanted my $ back at the theatre, which I got!"
2,not the worse film or acting...,"but definately not the best or even above average. why does kidman have to inhale rapidly like that after she finishes a sentence (referring her private video segments)? isn't she a trained actress that has learned breath control? i understand she wanted to protray a psycho-ditz, but... anyway, i watched it to the end, i guess mostly because it was based on a true story."
4,She's One Crazy Bi-aaach..,"....sorry to disagree with the last two reviewers, this is a good movie, because Nicole plays a less than virtuous role, like she does in ""Malice"" and some say ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Joaqiun Phoenix plays a stoner version of that kid in ""American Beauty"" and Illeana Douglas--well, I can get thrills just looking at that babe, but she does well as that sister who knows whats up from the beginning...this is better than what people say..."
2,"Quite Straight-Forward, Not That Interesting, Basically Dumb","Nicole Kidman (Suzanne Stone) is a TV director wanna-be that will stop at nothing to get there. Somehow she marries a small-town restaurant manager-to-be (for his dad) who is more interested in having a family. Pregnancy would ruin/delay her future. So she cons three half-wit teenagers into an overly-complicated plot to kill off her husband, then refuses to pay them off or continue her relationship with two of them that had motivated their participation in the first place.Ergo, the plot is dumb, the acting isn't much better."
4,A Strange And Fascinating Story,"This is a different story and definitely interesting. The movie is listed as a comedy but it's more of a drama. Yes, the comedy is there but it's dark humor and there is violence and tragedy here. It's fascinating, every time I watch it.Nicole Kidman is very good as the beautiful and ruthless blonde who has big television ambitions. I don't know if I ever saw Kidman look this pretty, which is saying a lot. Matt Dillon co-stars and is excellent, too, as are the two young no-name actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Allison Foland. Ironically, Phoenix went on to become a big star. When this movie came out, few people knew him.Illena Douglas gives an underrated performance and I always enjoy the odd Dan Hedaya. Anyway, if you want to see something definitely different in the way of a story, this movie falls in that category."
2,Buyer beware...,"This new edition of TO DIE FOR isn't what you think..Sony and Image are not telling the truth about the aspect ratio. It is NOT 1.85:1. It is, in fact, the 1.33:1 version. They used the wrong side of the previous 2-sided disc. Don't believe the info written about the aspect ratio of the current edition."
5,Great Documentary!,I love a mystery. The Lizzie Borden case has always been very intriguing to me. The documentary was very informative and the reenactments were very good and enjoyable to watch. Probably the best documentary on The Bordens that I've seen.
3,Surviving Childhood Cancer,This book is more for a child who has cancer. I was looking for a book about how to live your life when you have beat cancer and are trying to get back to normal life.
4,Sonic X,This is a pretty good dvd set of the saturday morning Sonic X cartoons. This is actually the second volume in a six part set. Anyway if you like the show you will want to get this set. Pretty nice stuff.
1,Garbage written by a sellout looking for help.,"Like any sell out of their own, she now cries for protection. She has reaped what she and her kind sowed. 20 years ago, the forwarnings of this where well known, but people like Catherine denounced them as racist bigots, so such. Now, like the sell-out then and now reaping her eternal benifits of such, should now be allowed to stew in a sewer of her own making. Tough Luck kid, maybe next life you won't sell out."
2,What a pity,Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.
2,hard read,"This one is definitely not Saturday morning light reading. The author does have some interesting insights into society, though."
2,This is Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook,"This book offers tried and true slow cooker fare -- the types of dishes that come to mind when you think of Crock Pots. I like the slow cooker basics section -- four pages for the slow cooker novice. Recipes in this book include appetizers, main dishes, sides, soups, stews and even breads and desserts (the weakest section, but it is a slow cooker book).This book is for folks who enjoy simple but good food. For a more exciting and expansive option, I recommend Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook. For something even more exotic, get The Gourmet Slow Cooker."
4,I really enjoy this book,"I have used this book's recepies many times and some have become favorites. It is beautifully illustrated and if you have ""somthing"" in the fridge you can look up a slow cooker recepie for it. Slow cooker recepies are aesy to follow and pretty much fool proof. I have to admit 365 are too many for me, and I have never even attmpted to cook up desserts, they look fussy and not best suited for this medium, although an adventurous cook might have fun with them. I would recommend this book, I have tried others, and this compares favourably."
3,Disappointing,"I was eager to get my hands on this book, but was sorely disappointed in it. The last chapter on Soup & Stews were not even Crock Pot recipes! There were duplicate recipes throughout and not many ""name brand"" ingredients were used."
3,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I am retired an decided that I wanted to learn how to tie flies. I bought a couple of books and read them. Since I live in a remote area with no other fly tyers near me that I know of, I thought that it would be useful to buy a video so that I could actually watch an experienced fltyer at work. Well, this video was a real disappointment. It does show some basic techniques and useful tips. It also shows how to tie two specific types of flies - Lefty's Deceiver and the Clouser Minnow. However, in general it presents the information in a VERY disorganized and incomplete manner. I also felt that the video itself was way too short. It's really too bad, because the fly tyers in the video are obviously knowledgeable and very experienced. I really expected much more from this video than I got. It wasn't a complete waste of money, but it could have been so much better."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,There is nothing of interest in this book. Read the Amazon and Publishers Weekly reviews - they politely explain how little of the content is either new or tells you anything significant about John Lennon. If you buy it you are only providing more money to a very rich talentless person who has parasited the memory of JL for 25 years.
3,A mixed bag,"This collection of essays varies wildly in quality. Many of them are generic praise from people who never even met the man, really stretching the idea of ""memories of John Lennon."" And a couple of the worst of these essays just stretch on for what feels like an eternity.However, there are some interesting ones sprinkled throughout that justified the purchase for me. The piece by Klaus Voorman was the definite highlight for me; he shares some firsthand memories of the ""househusband"" period which has largely remained shrouded in speculation, and shares some great drawings of John."
1,Pure junk...worth no stars,"Like any bottom-sucker, Yoko continues to feed off the legacy of a deeply troubled, yet brilliant, man. If you have a warm spot in your heart for John Lennon, do not buy this book."
2,Check elsewhere!,"Some of the norms are from obscure sources and acknowledgements that other norms even exist (where they almost always do) is lacking. Only occasionally has this book proven helpful when writing up reports. If that's why you want it, I'd check elsewhere first. I've even had trouble finding a concise statement of facets measured by some of the individual tests. The editor's general assessment book is much better put together. As a reference source, this one has been a disappointment."
2,Lorna Doone,"This movie is centered around a doomed love between two young people from bickering families. The movie is extremely slow with the first five minutes showing two people on horseback. There doesn't seem to be anything pulling the movie together to make you want to watch the ending. The basic theme and plot is an excellent storyline, but there is something lacking. Overall, I was expecting a romantic love story and instead found a dull way to spend 2 hours."
2,Not good!!!!!,"I own the other Lorna Doone Movie and this one was not in the same league. It was too short, first of all. It was like they were in a hurry to tell the story. It was not romantic at all. Beside the handsome Clive Owen and Sean Bean, the other characters were not good at all. It was a bad movie!!! I recommend the other Lorna Doone - DVD starring Richard Coyle and Amelia Warner. This was bad, not worth buying, just renting!"
2,Not up to par,"I agree with the reviewer who said the A&E 2001 version of this story is much better. While the actors in this version are better known, there was no chemistry at all between Clive Owen and the female lead. Also, the way the ""romance"" was handled created no dramatic tension. In fact, the pacing seemed off for the entire movie. What should have been adventurous and daring ended up flat, boring, and slightly confusing. I don't think it was the brevity of the film itself--I found myself waiting for it to end--but rather that the elements that make up good story telling were markedly absent. I was glad I had gotten this out of the library and neither rented nor bought it."
3,Not up to par,"Although this film features three very fine actors, it is far too short to do justice to the story. There wasn't enough urgency in the script to bring interesting action to the screen. Granted it was filmed in 1990, early in the careers of the three actors, and did have strong, established actors in the supporting roles, it did not deliver. Best thing about it is Sean Bean in his ""bad guy"" guise."
5,It's a wonderful story and I enjoyed this production of it.,The story of Lorna Doone has always fascinated me and I always look for new version of it. This one was excellent and I have enjoyed it. I'm sure I will watch is many more times.
2,Dull but entertaining,"When I first went to rent this movie, I was expecting a wonderfully portayed old-english love story with one of my favorite actors, Sean Bean. However, after watching it, I feel it falls short of a romance movie and instead makes its way toward a low-budget comedy movie. This movie was entertaining in that it had comical value in one of the main characters, John Ridd and it had some rather funny action scenes. It lost its potential as a romance when the production crew spent all its money on mediocre actors and gave little attention to sound effects and the screenplay itself."
3,Kathleen O'Neal Gear Sands in the Wind,"The book was entertaining but the story line was a little hard to follow. New facts seemed to show up willy-nilly. Normally these would add twists and turns to a story line, but in this case they confused me."
4,Sand in the Wind,See my last review for the 'Gear' books. They all read the same....GREAT!! Any new book based on the same subject matter would be in my library. Pronto!
5,Looks and feels great!,I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them! Won't take them off. They look even better on your feet and are very comfortable. The sizing is right on too. Excellent choice!
5,Tuan Jim,(...)Conrad knows how to tell a story and few have ever been told as well as this one. Lord Jim the character is very appealing but also appealing are the sea and island settings that Conrad describes so well. Those hard to resist settings as well as the tale itself populated by a host of memorable minor characters all conspire to make this an irresistable yarn. It appeals as an adventure but there is plenty to capture the discerning substantive mind as well. Conrad offers a tale about a young man who wishes to be a hero.(...)
2,Lord Jim,LORD JIM - I couldn't get into it - rather boring and difficult to follow.Perhaps I will give it another try at another time.
3,Interesting Dilemma???,"This story is in an interesting perspective in that Conrad uses a new way of writting style that is hard for some to grasp. Others find the style a strong new challenge for readers. I consider it a strong novel with an interesting plot, but not one of the turning points of America. It's just a book."
2,A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic,"Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Conrad, a man who learned English as a second language, shows an immense skill and confidence with it. His style and story is very interesting throughout the first half, but as soon as Jim enters Patusan, it falls apart. Jim tries to hard to love Jewel and to be accepted by his new community. Conrad would have done better to have stopped sometime after Marlowe's original discussions with Jim. Conrad originally intended to make his idea into a short story, and that is how it should have been."
2,"great plot, extremely confusing","Lord Jim had all the key elements for an extremely interesting story, love/ murder/ adventure, but quickly loses the reader with the confusing writing style. It is hard to know who is talking and Jim's personality or looks are only discussed in the first two senetences of the story. I believe that if Conrad had lightened his style a little bit it could have been a much better novel."
3,instructive,"lord jim's tale is a lesson to us all. if someone puts you in charge of hundreds of people's lives you can't just run away and leave them to die. so jim was puniched for his cowardly actions. also, he ran way when he was young,too, so this means that people dont ever really change their personalities. this is pretty true, too. i just wish jospeh conrad could have said this a bit quicker and used simpler words -- as he learnt english as a foreigner nobody ever told him not to memorize the dictionary. the story is also outof date, as nobody uses those kind of boats any more. maybe it could be updated -- made about a truck-driver or something who abandons his cargo, or a school-bus driver or somebody like that. then they could make a movie of it and we wouldn't be forced to study it in class."
5,Lord Jim,"Great Story. Also, additional material included is very helpful to help set the time and culture that the book was written. Conrad is considered a master writer for a good reason. Wayne Goodin"
1,Too Wordy!,"I was assigned this book through my 10th grade English course. Never before have I been forced to struggle through a book like this one. Conrad's style is adds superfluous information that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or symbolic significance of the story. The sentences and paragraphs were too large to be dealt with rationally. One of the chapters, which is about 4 and a half pages, is one single paragraph! While the story itself was a good one, Joseph Conrad ruins it with his esoteric and over-descriptive style of novel-writing."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind. Move along, move along! This ancient icon may be a monument to Conrad's mastery of his second language, and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny (or something equally dense), but listening to it doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat."
3,Don't understand the hype,"An interesting look into late 19th, early 20th century European views of the ""uncivilized"" parts of the world. That being said, it is not a book that moves along too easily"
2,Not as good as Heart of Darkness,"As much as I love Conrad's style, this one was just too long. He shouldn't have tried to write a full-blown novel. Some things should just be kept concise. If you want to read something good from Conrad, go after Heart of Darkness."
3,Surprisingly Disappointing,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I had purchased a Modern Library hardcover copy of Lord Jim for myself at a second hand bookstore for my birthday. I was really looking forward to reading it. However I struggled to finish the book, which in my edition was 400 pages long. I normally don't have a problem with books that long, and so I can't say that this was the turn-off. So, what was it that disappointed me? I never really felt empathy for any of the characters. In my book if you are looking for a classic tale of moral failure and attempted restoration try Thomas Hardy's ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" or Graham Greene's ""The Power and the Glory""."
3,"Decent story, but thickly written","We studied this book in a college literature class and I couldn't wait to finish it - author Joseph Conrad's thick writing made reading this book a real chore. Still, the story contains a decent plot and interesting main character. Lord Jim is an adventurous and charismatic young British sailor who survives a ship disaster in Asian waters, and finds himself blamed for the mishap. Stripped of his seaman's card, he must deal with overwhelming guilt while also seeking full or at least partial redemption. He ends up moving to the remote corners of the Malayan peninsula, where he becomes a trusted protector and helper of underdeveloped natives. Sound interesting? If you don't mind books written in a sluggish Victorian style, you'll probably enjoy LORD JIM. If you demand readability, go elsewhere."
3,"Good story, book fell apart","A wonderful story. However the book binding started falling apart during the reading, and it was such a problem I took out my library's copy to finish the book. So I recommend being a bit skeptical about the described book condition when purchasing."
5,A Fantastic Novel and Regenerative Work of Art,"Reading 'Lord Jim' I was struck by how similar it was in many ways to Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment. Conrad published 'Lord Jim' as a serial that straddled the beginning of the 20th century, and seemed to be hellbent on experimenting with form and style. The fractured narrative is buried in letters, conversations, remembered stories, etc. Conrad's style made me think of modernism swallowing a romantic tale. It was likeTreasure Islandbeing eaten by a novel by 'Dostoevesky.' I loved it.It also reminded me of Pynchon's classic problem. Most people are familiar withThe Crying of Lot 49andHeart of Darknessthanks to both being popular books to include when introducing high school students and college freshmen to classic works of modern and contemporary literature. Both Conrad and Pynchon's bigger AND better stuff requires more time and work.This is a fantastic novel, and a regenerative work of art."
4,"Alton says No, but I say yes!","Ok this one might be a total uni-tasker, but I love it! Crusty grilled cheese and cuteness abound in my kitchen. Yes it is a bit silly, but for its purposes it works well. It does take a little testing to get the right bread and filling combination, but it is fast and fun to use. I have noticed that excessive steam over the years has caused a little discoloration near the heating element, but that is to be expected with wear and tear. I recomend this to anyone who loves hello kitty, has a little extra space in their kitchen for a dreaded uni-tasker, and want to harken back to those ""as seen on tv"" pocket food maker maker days! BUY! BUY! BUY! Hurry while supplies last :)! ... ok maybe not for that last reason, but really it's bang has been worth the buck! Sorry Alton :)"
5,Book of many delights (&#65533; la belle &#65533;toile),"Like many reviewers here, I have also seen the National Geographic Top 100 Adventure list (ranked #3), and the Outdoor Magazine Top 25 Outdoor Literature list (ranked #1), or even the picture of Exupery on French Franc notes (pre-Euro). But it would be narrow to read it for its rank alone. ""Earth of Men"" (the French title) is poetic verse, metaphorical contrasts and profound insight on what it means to be alive. Exupery captures it through flight, but planes are ""only a tool"" he says, a means to an end, in stars of infinite possibilities."
2,too esoteric for my taste,"Maybe something lost in translation. More of a ""thoughts on life"" than a novel. Hope this helps. Lots of better aviation books too."
3,As lofty as flight itself,"First off, let me say that there were parts of this book that I thoroughly enjoyed. That truly transported me to another place. And for those moments alone, the book is worth reading.But as far as a consistently good read, it falls a bit short. The writing style is eloquent and high-minded, sometimes to the detriment of enjoyable reading. It seems as though he tried to pack so much meaing into every word that the words together almost seem to be too much.But if you have the time and focus to read this book, there are great moments to be shared between the reader, the author and his subject."
3,For pilot-philosophers,"The famous French pilot shares some experiences of his early career. Slightly rambling, the book does have some unforgettable moments. For example his description of a night under a cloudless Sahara sky. I liked that."
2,"Long Winded, Sand and Stars","There's one good chapter, a good story, about survival. Otherwise, the pretentious Frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style. His name matches his style, long-winded and pretentious."
2,I don't get it.,This was an interestng diversion but hardly the masterpiece that I was led to expect. Pretty ordinary.
2,Was Very Boring,I thought the book was horrible cuz it was nothing that i thought was exciting and also cuz it was very hard to read i hated it but that is my opinion but everyone i asked said they thought the same thing i just said!!!
5,Simply Marvelous!!!!!,"When this movie was released in theaters, it received bad reviews and I wondered out loud: ""What movie was the critics watching????"" This movie is awesome! I was completely drawn into the story because I could relate on a very personal level to all the things that happened in the movie, from beginning to end. The music was wonderful, too. I couldn't find anything to dislike about ""Kingdom Come."" It was the southern version of ""Soul Food"" only better. If you buy this DVD, you won't go wrong!"
5,"Like Everyman, Every Southern Family","Almost didn't watch this movie....wasn't in the mood for musicians trying to be actors....but decided what the hey, might be lighthearted and worth the video rental price...ended up really enjoying it, even coming to amazon.com to buy it. This film has many southernisms and dysfunctional-but-you-gotta-love-them familyisms. We adopted several lines in our own family ""You know yo Daddy love us!"" ....a certain sign that we enjoyed it! It had excellent situational comedy and Whoopi plays the most understated part of her career, and it really works!"
3,Decent movie but not worth the money,"I have to start off by saying who ever cast this movie did an excellent job. Who ever wrote the script did a very poor job. The story line was no where as great as the casting was. The story line was very corny,repetitive, and many times boring. I was so glad when the movie was over. I think the movie could have been a whole lot better but it wasn't just awful. In case you are thinking about buying this movie, DON'T."
2,not worth buying,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers. The plot was very weak. Too often I was left saying to myself ""ok, what's the point here?"" I did enjoy certain actors' ability to take on diverse roles, but when it came to substance.......a needle in a haystack."
1,WHY???,"I was definitely turned on by all of the hype before the movie. The commercial previews left me with much anticipation....LL, Jada, Vivica Fox, Whoopi!!! I couldn't wait! Then I saw the movie..........What happened? How could they have all of those folks in there and have that movie turn out that way? All I can really say is that I was truly disappointed and I don't know who was at fault. I've seen all of these people in other productions, so I know they can act....was it the director? the producer? Now here's a good question, Toni Braxton WAS in the movie, right? So why in the world would they have Jada up there acting like she was singing?????? I can't go on............."
4,A favorite,"This is one of my 13-year-old daughter's favorite movies. I found it entertaining, albeit a little over the top (Jada Pinkett Smith's character)."
5,Very funny and endearing,"Wow what a great cast. Movie had some very funny moments and some parts that were very touching and endearing. Great performance from Anthony Anderson, he is on his way to superstardom. Anthony and Jada have real chemistry and I hope they do another film together. Another standout performance from Vivica Fox. Clyde was my favorite character, he had me on the floor with laughter. The only negative thing is sometimes the script kinda made some of the characters look like caricatures instead of real people. Very funny performance from Jada."
2,The comedy does not mix with the drama,"In ""The Wood"" ""Get On The Bus"" and ""Soul Food"" the filmmakers was able to balance the comedy with the drama but in ""Kingdom Come"" nuthin works...One second there is a dramatic reminiscing about the death of an unborn child and in the next Jada Pinkett starts screaming and tries to be funny (which she definitly is not)...I like Jada Pinket in ""Set It Off"" and in ""Jason's Lyric"" but u find yourself wanting to strangle her character in this movie...Not even LL COOL J, Vivica A Fox or Whoopie Goldberg can save this movie from being a disaster...When making this movie they should have chosen either to make a comedy or a drama.The movie is kind of like a 90 minute commercial for the church mixed with Drama and strangled comedy."
2,no plot whatsoever,"first off, i thought this was going to be a very funny movie, because of all the stars and wonderful people in it such as L.L Cool J, Whoopi Goldberg, Anthony Anderson, my girl Jada Pinkett Smith, Toni Braxton, and a host of others. first of all is was all about them at a funeral. it wasnt that funny and the plot was very weak,we was so excited about this movie when it came out but its not worth it, and i love everybody that was in the movie just not the characters that they played. so i give it a D-"
3,Good beginners book,"This is a good beginners book with short sections on different topics. That's all it is thoughm a beginners book. If you're looking for something more in-depth, then this book will do nothing but disappoint you. I ordered this book along with Different Loving. This one is now shelved while Different Loving is being refered to over and over again. Unless you're a beginner or someone just curious, I wouldn't get this one."
5,"To submit your body and life to another - no, this isn't a religious thing","To submit your body and life to another - no, this isn't a religious thing. This is a few people's ideas of romance. Now in a new and updated edition for the new millennium, ""The Loving Dominant"" is a guide to the BDSM (a short hand way of abbreviating the life style meaning Bondage, Discipline, Submission, and Masochism) for any reader too timid to vocally ask the questions about the lifestyle which is more kind and loving than it seems to the people involved. Covering advice to make the best of the lifestyle to all, and with advice on toy-construction and photography, ""The Loving Dominant"" is an ideal addition to any human sexuality shelf and for any alternative lifestyle collection."
5,"Whip me, Beat, me, Love me","An AMAZING BOOK! For both subs and doms, this book is PERFECT for anyone in the scene. It offers phycological info, stero-types, hoe to make scenes, and more! This is the FIRST book you must read when getting into ""bondage"" & ""power exchange"". If you don't, you have missed out!Also works great for giving to your loved one, as a suggestion for getting kinky...though it might scare them."
4,Seems authoritative to me!,"... I find his ethos completely credible. Certainly his range of experience and his resulting expertise can't be doubted; Warren has been in the community for many years and knows whereof he speaks. It's particularly interesting reading for those new to the scene; both dom and sub will learn a lot from Warren's upfront, knowledgeable, humble (Mentor?? Humble??) approach. And he isn't a bad writer, either, on top of it all.I'm glad the book is available, and it would be a shame if anyone believed the personal attacks on Warren's character and didn't read the book because of them. An evil array of consensual head games to play with subs, constant reminders of safety, discussions of the various elements of the scene, and Libby's chapter on submission are invaluable for the newbie and the expert alike. Thanks to John Warren for making his undeniable expertise available."
3,typos and other minor issues,"Warren's highly personalized approach is enjoyable, and his dominant personality leaps from the pages (he's sure to point out the chapter written by a submissive was ""at [his] request"").The title tells the rest.However, numerous typos and other minor issues pop up at annoying times."
4,Worth reading,This is a very good book that is quite helpful. It is geared for people who are already in the BDSM scene and looking for more knowledge within the scene. It is worth buying for bottoms and tops.
2,Ho hum,"Aside from the numerous typos, I found the book to be deadly dull with little of substantive value. Redundancy abounds as case after case leaves you glassy eyed begging on bended knee for it all to end. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one. I give it two stars for the sheer skill of Mr. Warren, a pompus egomanic, but shrewd marketeer. To bad he can't write."
3,Warning - topaz book,this is a topaz book so it won't go on my reader; no way to cancel the purchase; got screwed by Amazon again...
1,READ THIS FOR HONESTY,"I bought this product hoping for a nice poker chip set.It came a week late(i have prime, so this was very sad...)Not only was it late but the carrying case cameBROKEN at EVERY END.The chips are very nice and high quality, so if you don't care about the case, buy it anyways.I simply had to return it because I needed a way to hold and store my chips.Case-0/5 starsChips-5/5 stars"
3,Fun for kids,The chips in this set are nice and heavy. Unfortunately the lining of the case is already coming apart when you open it. It is a great set for kids.
2,Looks and feels too cheap to give as a gift,"I bought this for my brother for his birthday but I had to return it because I was to embarrassed to give it to him. The dice have rounded edges so you can't use them for gambling. The cards are very cheap so you would also swap those out for your own. Basically you buy this just for the travel case and the chips. Well, the case I received was rusted. yes, a brand new case, out of the box, had rust on the handle and the closure buckles. I returned it."
5,High quality product!,"Received my order very quickly. Good quality chips and cards, plus they come packaged in a sturdy case. No complaints whatsoever!"
4,good,this product was overall good the picture however is a little miss leading the picture shows white red blue green blue yellow orange pink but only comes with white blue red green black and yellow. over all this product it very good if you want a good poker set and the price was great! Over all good
1,Disappointed,"Received the alluminum case that was broken in the corners. At the first look thought it was damaged in shipping. But when I looked for the missing/ broken pieces, I could not find them in the shipping box. Then I realised that they packed a broken poker set. Ridiculuos..... how can they sell a crappy product. Utterly disappointed!!"
1,poor quality set,I was very disappointed with the set. It looked like low quality items were selected for the set. The dice looked cheap and were dislodged from the fitting when I opened it. I was unable to fit them back altogether in their slot. It was as if the dice went to another set. I will be looking for a nicer set now.
2,Get what you pay for,The chips are OK (would like a few more white).The case is terrible and came apart within a week.Would not purchase again.
5,pocket protector for my lab jecket,"I use this item to hold multiple scissors, needle drivers and reflex hammer in the pocket of my white clinical lab jacket--works great! No more holes torn out in the pocket and all items transfer out of my coat into book bag or locker quickly and easily. Highly recommend, very sturdy build quality!"
2,Not impressed so far,"First up, it's not as big as I expected and iv not had it long but it doesn't seem too durable, the slide in's are a little too short to hold an average pen and subsequently the Velcro flap doesnt close too well over the top.It may prove its worth but I think I'm going to end up getting something a little bigger and can hold a few pens trauma sheers alcowipes, pen light l, maybe a few meds etc.Bottom line: this will do the job but only just"
4,More tasy downtempo bits,"Another choice piece from pork recordings. This CD is very interesting and choc full of chilled out tracks characteristic of pork.Downtempo grooves with well placed instruments, samples and synths. The entire album is very well produced and cohesive, and the tracks are well composed. Catchy and original - if you like other pork releases such as Baby Mammoth, Fila Brazillia or Bullitnuts, you should know what to expect by now (excellence).The songs are at once catchy and original, yet detailed and rich. A perfect CD to drive on a summer day or night, or to pop in he cd player when chilling out. Guaranteed to have you humming, nodding your head and just enjoying the disc.Top notch chilled out beats."
4,"Great info, poorly written","This biography of Walter Becker and Donald Fagan is loaded with interesting information about the lives and near maniacal recording practices of Steely Dan. I believe this is the pretty much the only biography of Steeley Dan available and as a huge fan I could not put the book down. Note, however, that great literature this is not. The book is extremly poorly written, bordering on offensive at times, but the content more than makes up for it."
3,For Fans' Eyes Only,"Impossible to write the whys and wherefors of what goes on in an artist's mind without actually interviewing the artist.We know Steely Dan are quirky, sarcatic, cynical and can compose a beautiful tune. I think one reviewer compared their music to a velvet glove wrapped around a brass-knuckled hand.Be that as it may, Dan fans will eat this stuff up (I did) It's mostly a compilation of published and bradcast interviews with a little heresay thown in for good measure.Ironically, Brian Sweet criticizes a 1979 or 1980 Time magazine article for not actually interviewing Becker or Fagen. He doesn't either!"
3,Buy the DVD people!,"I haven't bought this book, but I may. I just wanted all of the Dan fans to know that there is a DVD out there which I bought (probably here) several years ago, which does interview Fagan and Becker, which probably contains similar information in this book. It didn't sound like anyone knew about this DVD from these book reviews I've read, so if you didn't know the DVD existed, it does."
3,This is STUPID,I have already done this for this product.Get yourselves together over there.I cannot give a good review as I bought this book as a gift and had it sent directly to the person.
3,A good book,If you are looking for much inside info on Fagen and Becker you will not find it here ....or anywhere for that matter. You will find much technical info as to how the recordings were made and that end of the business. It gave me great insight as to how they make such perfection and grace.
3,Just OK,"Book is interesting for Dan fanatics, but a bit esoteric unless you're a very experienced musician. Too much musical jargon without any translation for the common man."
3,Steely Dan: Reelin In The Years,"Not enough recording details for me. Several pages on the 1968-1972 period, but not enough detail to put the Becker-Fagen ""demos"" into chronological order. The index section is useless, as virtually none of the listed topics can be found on the pages specified. About of the way into the book I started wondering if there is a better Steely Dan book out there."
2,"About as fun as playing the play money tables online, which begs the question...","Why pay for a game you can play for free if you have an internet connection? Basically, it comes down to how much enjoyment you'll get out of playing in career mode. This game feels like a first draft: there's not much variety to the opponents 'chatter' and reactions, nor is the color commentary very good -- not half as well done as Madden Football and other sports games. The character design engine is half-baked -- barely a fraction of what you can do with your golfer the Tiger Woods game.Overall, I'm having a hard time thinking of ways to recommend it. Still, I made the final table of my first tourney and I'll probably keep playing for a while, but I'd suggest picking this up used if you can get it cheap -- it's really not going to impress anyone."
3,Nurturing Father,"I bought this game for my kids figuring they could learn the rules and how to play. It does teach them these things. However, the game is only for one player. It would be much better if 2 to 4 players could play against other ""players"" at the table."
2,Another lie about large numbers meaning blessing,"I was asked to read this book (along with several others from this author), by a friend. I am a Christian who holds a Biblical worldview and found this book to be interesting in many ways, but off the mark in some ways too. If you have a strong Bible background...you can sift the wheat from the chaff in this book and the Spirit will certainly speak through it. If not, I suggest you run from it and don't allow this into your head. This is another preacher trying to convince others that having large numbers of congregants equates to God's blessing. This is another lie that does not line up with the Bible or true Christianity. This is once again not a true picture of how Church is described in the Bible nor does it deliver a good explanation of the Gospel message."
4,A NOSTALGIC COMPILATION FROM ONE OF THE BEST,"ALL OF THE SONGS THAT MADE JOHN DENVER GREAT CAN BE FOUND IN THIS COLLECTION. FROM THE WHIMSICAL TO THE LOVELORN, IT'S ALL HERE. THIS COLLECTION WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH ALL OVER AGAIN, AND CRY ALL OVER AGAIN AS WELL, AS YOU SPAN EVERY EMOTION WITH DENVER. TRULY A GREAT STORYTELLER IN SONG, HIS GREATNESS IS THAT NEVER DID HE TAKE HIMSELF TOO SERIOUSLY. JUST A GREAT LISTEN. THIS ONE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,"Legendary performance, third-rate packaging","A simple internet search reveals lots of details about this historic recording, but you won't find any of them in the CD booklet of this release. Instead, the booklet contains only the track listing, which is not printed anywhere else, which makes it necessary to open the otherwise useless booklet to find out what the tracks are.I agree with the other reviewer who complained about the noise reduction that was evidently applied to the recording. The music sounds flat and muffled.I'm clueless as to why this is a ""Special 60th Anniversary Edition."""
3,It was okay...,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSI thought the letters got stranger and stranger as the book went on. Grandma confessing that there is a ""love of her life"" who is NOT Grandpa to her Granddaughter via letters. I was hoping for something deeper?But the romance between Jen and her childhood friend kept the book going. Unlike other people, I did not cry - I just did not form that emotional connection."
4,The wonderful thoughts of Danyel,I don't read alot but i am glad that i made myself read this book because it really touch me and it influenced me to want to read more. The wonderful story tells of love that is lost and found and how love can change your life forever. One main asset that i recived is that if you loose a love you can move on and still find happiness. This book is now my favorite book to just sit down and get lost in it. I love how Mr.Patterson makes you feel as if you are a part of the story. I hope to have a love like this book gives.
4,Where is the love?,"Patterson has tapped into the broken heart of America and modern life. The only good thing to come out of the stinking holy war is it has people searching for meaning and signs of connection outside themselves. Or, as the Blackeyed Peas sang it: WHERE IS THE LOVE? Modern love sprouts between tragedy and hope and that is what Patterson writes about in this book. He does a pretty job but he lays on the syrup too thick, which is to be expected from so commercial a writer. Most big selling writers go sugary when writing about the emotional life and I'm not sure it's helping. Anyway, a book with stark psychological insights that I recommend is IN THE GHOST COUNTRY a reflective and sometimes shocking examination of the dead in one man's life."
5,prattgirl,"I normally don't go for mushy romance type books...I am more of a fan of Patterson's other material, but this book was great. It was a quick read, which once I started, I couldn't put it down. Everytime I got my eyes dried and cheered up, bam- he hit me with something new and I was crying again. Patterson has outdone himself yet again."
1,A waste of time.,"This book, which tries to act like a full sized book, but is so full of larger print...larger spacing....huge margins...empty pages or nearly empty pages....chapters cut into 10 or 15 pieces, so that they can then insert MORE blank pages....is a big, fat, waste of time. It pretty much reads like a 13 year old girl's diary...sappy, and not in touch with reality. I love a good tear jerker...this one was neither good OR a tear jerker. The only good thing I can say about reading this book is that I got it at the library and did not pay for it....I'd have kicked myself if I had paid for it. My advice? Don't waste your time OR your money. How this ever made the Best Sellers List is beyond me."
2,"Manipulative, but sweet",Worth the $2 I spent on it at the used book sale. (They lost me when the hero brings an electrocuted kitty back to life - oy!)
1,I just don't know about this one...,"My mom passed this book on to me with the words, ""it's a quick read."" And I will give her proper credit, it was a quick read. Unfortunately, the plot is far from subversive and the characters are two dimensional at best. The plot while slightly outlandish (woman loses husband and miscarries, then meets a man that is also dying) could technically happen, but I was not emotionally invested in any of these characters. And sadly, I think that is what this book is missing, characters that the reader knows or indentifies with or some sort of level. When I read, I like to think well I know someone like that or I can picture that character. I didn't do that at all in this book. Patterson seldom gets behind typecasted characters to actually create anyone real. I am honestly not sure what could have saved this book, more exposition or details maybe...not a total write off...but nothing spectacular."
3,No depth but lots of shocking twists!,"I think Patterson's attempts at romance/drama (not relative to mystery, of course) resemble Nicholas Sparks' books: decent story line, but sort of Lifetime-ish. They are too dramatic, have a few plot holes, have tons of one in a million happenings, and don't go deep into character development. And the ending always has a shocking twist: boy killed woman's husband in a freak accident but they're in love so what do we do, boy meets girl and they fall in love but boy has fatal illness unbeknownst to girl etc. They're fun to read, but not very realistic.All in all, it's a quick, lighthearted read. Like Sparks' books, this book has a huge margin on not-so-wide pages with larger than average print. If you're looking for depth, I wouldn't reccommend this."
2,disappointing,"I agree the book is quick and easy read. But I disagree that it was a romantic tearjerker. It is obvious that Patterson is a man writing about a woman. Before I even started it I figured out the plot, the ending and everything in between. One that really annoyed me was the fact that only one man was in the story with Jennifer and of course they must fall in love. I was surprised in myself, I cry easily over anything romantic and loveydovey - but this did not touch me. He used stories or sayings that are quite trite and disappointed me in lack of imagination. (The jar of sand and rocks - come on how many times have we heard it before) I was hoping for more from such an acclaimed author, but he left me with nothing. I am sure by next week I will have forgotten all about it. If he writes another I am going to pass it by, like I would recommend to others about this book."
2,Didn't feel anything,"Okay, this is a tough one. I didn't like or dislike this story. It just didn't touch me on an emotional level the way ""Suzanne's Diary"" did. What it did do was leave me with some questions, however. What exactly was the purpose of these letters anyway? And why were they written in letter form? Why not as a diary? Why write them and never mail them. And wasn't Brenden just a little to good to be true? I'm not much of a ""romance"" reader, but it seems that whenever I have read a romance, it almost always takes place at a lake or in a remote cabin near some body of water. Quite the cliché and a bit boring. By the time I got to the end I felt nothing. A bit disappointing, since I normally like Patterson's books. But if you looking for a quick way to waste an afternoon, this might be for you."
2,Not particularly moving,"It's a nice, fast summer read, and I must admit to shedding a tear or two, but overall, I didn't like it.I don't think I'll be reading more James Patterson. For one thing, he is totally unconvincing as a 35-year-old female. I mean come on. There's this one line about an ""upside-down ponytail"" and it almost made me quit reading and throw the book against the wall in frustration. Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why? No one knows.Anyway, if you're in the mood for a fluffy read, you might be ok with this one. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Disappointed,"I read all the books put out by Patterson...and love the Alex Cross character. This one was over the top. I don't know, it was just too simple. Now granted it was nice to read it in one night after a busy day at work, but it just left me saying , ""huh"". Lots of holes, but I guess there were some feel good moments. Like another reviewer wrote, way too many ""you are gorgeous"" moments over and over.Agent Cross, we are ready for your return!"
5,Couldn't put it down....,"Yes, I'm a very big James Patterson fan, and he didn't let me down. Sam's Letters to Jennifer was great! I couldn't put it down. I love all of Patterson's books but the romantic ones are right up there with my other favorite author, Nicholas Sparks. A must read for any true romantic. Okay, maybe it wasn't as good as Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, but it will go on my shelf as one of my very favorites!"
2,WASTE OF TIME,Thank goodness this was a short book because it was a complete waste of my time. The story was boring and predictable but the worst thing is how VERY POORLY WRITTEN it is. It's like some high school kid wrote it. This Patterson guy needs some writing classes. There is no way I would go near another one of his books again. And I read constantly. Save your time and money on this one. It was terrible!
1,Sugary Harlequin Story,"If you're a lonely housewife, romantic at heart, and like harlequins, wait for Patterson's book to come out in paperback. It's an easy sugary read, tugging at your heartstrings, but not worth the hardcover price. It also seems to me that Patterson is jumping on a new genre style of writing and ""literally"" losing his fans of Alex Cross. He is trying to capitalize on sappy, romantic, tragic, love stories after his success of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and picking a touristy, profitable town like Lake Geneva, which he may not even have visited for more than a day, just to sell his books and make more money. I admit I like easy, romantics once in a great while, but a classic writer like Patterson should leave the romantic books to R.W.A (Romance Writers of America). And lastly, he should fire his editor and take writing classes again with all his money. This is not literature; it's choppy, full of basic writing errors, and cliché."
2,Eh,James Patterson lost his touch in this book. The romance seemed too forced and the plot didn't flow as smoothly as you would expect it would from a Patterson novel. The fact the the reverend is shacking up with a married women is never discussed. Jennifer becomes romantically involved with a man she knew when she was too young to remember him and the apprehensions about becoming involved so recently after her first husband's death are only lightly discussed. The story seems too forced and Patterson should stick to mystery thrillers.
2,Predictable and Unrealistic,"This book was an easy, fast read, but the story line was very melodramatic and predictable. There was no depth to the story. The romance was a little too sappy."
4,Kleenex clutcher!,"True lovely - if predictable - book. It is a one sitting read, but have a kleenex in hand! I enjoyed the easy reading, honest characters, and change of pace for Patterson. I give it 4 out of 5 sniffles."
3,Same Formula as Suzanne's Diary,"I also read Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and enjoyed it very much. It seemed fresh compared to other stuff out there. So, I like others had to read Sam's Letters. Patterson is now knocking out these love stories in a formula - medical tragedy, heartbreak and dramtic loss of loved one - finding true love again. His characters say and do the same things....dancing barefoot to old music and can't live without each other.I spent $15 in airport book store...read it in less than 4 hours (before the plane landed) and wasn't worth the $$$."
2,Good beach book,"With all the publicity surrounding this book, I was hoping for a great summer romance--'a woman conquers her greatest fears and overcomes her tentative inclinations in order to love again!' It was a good one night read. It actually seemed like a rough draft of a great book--fine, but not very satisfying. If you must, buy a used copy, or borrow one from the library."
1,Disgusted,"This book glorifies adultery. Between a married woman and her pastor, no less. She didn't love her husband? Why not divorce him? Why marry him in the first place? Why cheat on him? And, try to justify it to her granddaughter?"
2,thought I picked up Danielle Stele by mistake,"Not the best of Patterson. Almost as bad as a soap opera. Pretty unbeleiveable. Wouldn't want to be around this Jen character, everyone she is close to dies!!! The best was old granny in a coma, recovers, makes dinner for everyone, then dies....could it have been the roast beef??? Stick to Alex Cross!!!!~"
1,Like getting jabbed by a stick with poo on it.,"It might make you cry a little, but mostly you're angry that such a thing has been inflicted on you.And it stinks.Really, really bad."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"I collect books that feature Wisconsin or are written by a Wisconsin author.This book uses Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as the setting. Nearly every reference to the town and even the way Patterson categories it is wrong.If you don't know the town make up a fictional one rather than try to capitalize on a town's cachet. In the least have someone fact-check the work."
1,Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"I knew I should have put the book down and not wasted any more of my time when the author writes that Jennifer puts on her husband's Michigan U jogging suit. There is no Michigan U! There is The University of Michigan (U of M) or Michigan State University (MSU). But I unfortunately kept reading only to subject myself to reading the preposterous scene of when Brendan and Jennifer performing CPR on one Of Jennifer's cats and it lives. So, at that point I put the book down and have no intention of finishing it or purchasing another book by James Patterson."
2,Let's compare two books,"First of all Sam's Letters aren't the main story of the book. The main story is Jeniffer's love story and the letters has nothing to do with this book. If you compare ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"" with this book lets see what'll happen:1= Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas2= Sam's Letters to JenniferLove story 1 Excellent 2 GoodReading the diary/letters 1 Excellent 2 Waste of timeThe story outside diary/letters 1 Excellent. 2 ExcellentEmotions (cry, laugh, hate, etc.) 1 Excellent 2 PoorBook's end 1 Excellent 2 Poor"
3,Disappointing Patterson,"Dont get me wrong, I liked the book. Notice I said liked. I had high hopes for this book. I have read every book he has ever written and was surprised by this one. Hoping it was along the calibur of Suzannes Diary for Nicholas I rushed out to buy it on day one. Now I wish I had borrowed it from a friend. It was not realistic to me. I realize it is a book of fiction but this book to me was over the top on some points. For instance, when you read it, count how many times they use the name of the person they are talking to in conversations. When I am sitting talking to my husband, I dont use his name in every other sentence. Another thing was how repetitive the compliments were. How many times in a day can you tell someone they are the most beautiful girl in the world. GAG! If you want real romance and to shed some tears give the book I named earlier by Patterson a try. Or, better yet, read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. Come back soon Alex Cross! Please!"
4,I just don't know...,"My mom gave me this book last summer to read. I've never read a James Patterson book before so I don't know how his other works are. Personally, I have a love/hate relationship with this book.Like the main character, I also have a lot of happy memories about Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. I live on the west coast now and find myself missing it a lot. So sharing those warm memories and talking about all the places that I remember makes me a little home sick, just like Jennifer (though it's technically not her home).It's also a very sad story, which makes me dislike it. I hate to hear how in such a place that carries warm memories for her that things can change and take a turn for the worse. This is definitly not the typical go to the happy place to feel happy again type of book.Bring your tissues."
1,"Disappoionting, Cliche, Predictable, and Poor Materials","I'm quite a fan of Patterson's books. To read this kind of poor plot crap was a waste of time! The story was nice if putting in one or two sentenses, but to make a book it ought to have a better research and twists than this! The worst of his books I've read by far!This is a complete junk, lame story. Mind as well read a gossip column from National Enquirer!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Predictable, Unfortunate","I LOVED Suzannes's Diary for Nichols & began to read this book with great enthusiasm (and high expectations). I expected to be surprised, emotionally overwhelmed, and had a tissue box on hand. Instead, I was bored, annoyed, and ""underwhelmed"" emotionally. I never cried. I only finished reading because I always finish what I start. If you must choose between this and Suzanne's Diary - read Suzanne!! If you must read both, start with this selection so that you can have something to look forward to - Sam's Letters to Jennifer is a flop for me."
2,Just ok,"After reading Suzanne's Diary for nicholas, i could hardly wait to get my hands on this book. Well, it wasn't worth the wait. It is a fast read, but not as compelling as Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. Do yourself a favor. Check it our from the library instead of buying."
1,Awful read!,"You really need to read this kind of trash books once in a while to be able to fully appreciate good books. I picked it up from Borders because they had it on a huge sale. I should have known why nobody would buy it at normal price.A grandma (soon to be great grandma) confessing about an unconvincing extra marital affair to her grand daughter while the grand daughter herself is finding a new love in her life, in a not-so convincing manner! How sick can this get?It is almost like the author just followed a predictable plot line."
2,Sam vs. Suzanne,"I'm not going to be too hard on this book, because I knew what I was getting into. I took the plunge based no my experience with Suzanne's Letters to Nicholas. This book did not bring forth the same reaction from me. I cried and was moved for days based on the before mentioned book. This novel didn't bring me to that place.I appreciated the story but felt it predictable. To be fair, I read Suzanne's at a different time in my life, and perhaps I was more emotional and less jaded toward predictable storylines.In any event, if you were going to select one book to read between Sam's or Suzanne's, I certainly suggest Suzanne's."
3,This book seemed familiar,"Jennifer is still mourning the death of her husband, Danny, when her beloved grandmother, Samantha, goes into a coma. Jennifer goes to stay in Samantha's lake house, a place she loved to go as a child. When she arrives, she finds a bundle of letters from her grandmother who has written things about herself that Jennifer never knew. This is a tear-jerker, love story which has the obligatory love, death and illness scenes as part of the plot. When I was reading it, I felt that as if I'd ""been there and done that"" in other books I'd read. Patterson attempts to write the kind of love story that Nicholas Sparks and Charles Martin write, but it doesn't turn out nearly as well."
3,"Good, fast, easy read.","This was an o.k. book, something to read that isn't to deep or involved. It's a sweet story probably something ""Lifetime"" would make a movie out of."
3,Entertaining,"A unique storyline, but a little too predictable. Some of the scenes did not make sense (author eluded that Jennifer can guess the mystery person in Sam's life, but she never did). Otherwise, a good book to read on a lazy afternoon."
4,Love and Romance,"I listened to the CD version in my car. I really enjoyed it. If you like a good love story or romance, you will enjoy this book. I have read most of Patterson's suspense novels and this is the exact opposite. It is hard to believe the same man writes two totally different types of books. So if soap operas and chick lit are your cup of tea, you will like this book. Power Path to Love"
3,Kudos to Whoever Wrote It,"I recently read an interview with Mr. Patterson wherein it was disclosed that he writes outlines for his novels, and then collaborators (which is a fancy word for anonymous authors) create the actual stories. That colored my reading of this entertaining, light novel about a woman and the advice shared by her grandmother via a series of letters.The premise is a familiar one, and there will be very few surprises. Getting there, however, is the main part of the interest. Jennifer has recently suffered a loss, and Sam is trying to help her allow herself happiness again. I won't include a bunch of spoilers here as so many others have done, but if you've read more than a couple of these sorts of novels, you'll know how it will end.I quite enjoyed the story, and look forward to reading the other novel that has been written in this vein, ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas."" All my best to the faceless author who put this together on the basis of Mr. Patterson's outline."
2,Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"This is far from even being a ""fair read"". I'm an avid James Patterson fan, but Patterson is riding on the coattails of the tremendous success of ""Suzanne's Diary"". I found this book dull, predictable, and written as though a novice was putting out a first book. What a waste of money. Patterson is a writer worth following, but he lost me on this one!"
5,Five star!!!!! Sam's Letters to Jennifer,"I had been meaning to read this book, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, for some time now. I stayed up most of the night because I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what came next, again and again. The story held my attention right to the very last page. Wonderful, endearing, and classis James Patterson!"
1,Sam's letters to jennnifer,"Another James Patterson novel. As I reached the end, l realized I have already read the book, several years ago. As Jennifer read her grandmother's storytelling of her romance with a man whom she did marry but no one was told except Jennifer and her Brendan at the end of the story. Patterson tells a good with lots of scenic descriptions and makes the characters seem real"
3,Letters & Forgotten Love,"I wanted to care about Jennifer's grandmother, Sam, unconcious in the hospital. I wanted to like Jennifer, to want her to overcome the sadness from her husband's death, to find new love. I hoped Sam's letters would be moving and vital.Unfortunately the story just did not catch fire.The conversations are banal, the soon-to-die new boyfriend and other characters just never seem real. The description of the lake, and the people don't evoke feelings in the reader. As Jennifer reads her grandmother's letter (interspersed with her own developing romance), one learns of Sam's secret affair. Again the people seem less than real and the reader cares little about discovering who the mysterious lover was.The chapters are skimpy, the reading level suitable for an 8th grader, and the overall development of the story seems sluggish. Needless to say, it was disappointing.I've read Harlequin romances that had more engaging characters than these."
3,Could Have Been Better,I was so excited when i saw this book because i loved Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas but this book was a bit of a dissappointment. I read it pretty quickly but was disappointed with the predictabilty of the whole story. It is a good book to read if you are not expecting something great.
4,Easy read for a lazy afternooon,"I enjoyed this book- it was a very easy read, however there were some areas that I wish were more detailed.My favorite part was the letters from Sam- I would have been happy for that to be the whole book- the secondary love story got a bit to sappy for me- but still a nice read."
3,Wifey Cried Through This One,"My wifey begged me to read this one. I guess she wanted to draw some emotionalism out of me. It didn't work. The story was too flowery for me, but although a great author in Patterson."
1,"Sappy, stupid and predictable","Boring, sappy, stupid and predictable should have been the title for this review. It says it all. Shallow characters who have ""suffered hardships"" find that ""love conquers all."" The whole story is one big cliche."
4,Nice shirt read,"This book was a very quick read, I enjoyed the love story. I got this because it was recommended to N Sparks fans. I am interested in getting the other love stories by this Author."
5,Magnificent Read!!!,Such a sweet story! I loved this book and totally recommend it!Everyone should read this. Young or old! =)
3,Sweet and Simple,"This is not a thought provoking novel, but it is a sweet and simple love story. If you are looking for a quick read that will make you appreciate every day, this is a book for you."
4,Moved to tears,"I loved this book. I haven't read any other James Patterson books, but I will. This was very touching and very well put together. The author has a knack for moving the reader to tears. Bring the kleenex for this one! Also liked The Wedding by Sparks, The Notebook, and The Bark of the dogwood---all really good books."
1,confused from page 1,"did anyone notice the masculine pronoun ""he"" referring to Sam on the first few pages??? then, when the call from the nursing home came, sam was no longer a ""he"" but a she! i must've re-read the first 5 pages at least 10x, wondering if i was seeing things!!! editting mistakes like that, right out of the gate, are totally bogus. i never bothered reading further!"
2,Just like Suzanne's Diary...,"I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, so I thought I'd check this out. I didn't think it was worth my time. The books seemed exactly alike - especially the tone of the character's writing style (Suzanne vs. Sam). It seemed clear that since Suzanne's Diary did so well, the author decided to write a book exactly like it. It was an incredibly predictable love story."
1,Merely a short story,"I found this ""novel"" to be one of the poorest I have read to date. The characters are not developed, the story line was weak and it lacked imagination. It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money."
1,Why do I bother?,I don't know why I bother with James Patterson-all the melodrama and cliches. This book typifies his style. I correctly quessed the ending after reading just 20 pages of this book. It's sappy and silly. I promise not to do this to myself again...
2,Pass it up!,"This is not good! I resent authors who formulate a story based on another writer's success. Just for the record--we all can spot the Nicholas Sparks, Danielle Steele and Mary Higgins Clark's of the world ... They do not respect their readers only their pocketbooks. (Same story over and over, new characters.) Mr. Patterson, you are too good for this. I am mad. I bought this book a while back and forgot I had read it, so I did it again. By the time I realized I had already read it I was well into it, I figured, well, I have already read it, but it's a Patterson, so it will be a good read. Well I am throwing it out so I don't do this again!! Don't write from a woman's perspective. You don't HAVE a woman's perspective, i.e. ""voice""! I love the Women's Murder series and it translated beautifully to tv. We miss it a lot. I've pre-ordered #8. You rock at what you do. Stay with it!"
5,AMAZING love story!!,"I had picked up this book at Border's not knowing what to expect. I had never read any of James Paterson's books before, but the summary inside the cover caught my eye. Needless to say, this book was incredible!! The love story it possess is truly one of a kind. It will definitely inspire you and make you think about love in a whole new way. I advise you to have a box of tissues nearby though... it really is a tearjerker!!"
5,Why is it out of print?,"I am appalled that such a wonderful,helpful and amusing book isn't available.I'm going to have to give MY well preserved copy to a family friend who's graduating from college.Except for a few sections,the advice is timeless."
2,Help! This was not a good book!,This (i am soory to say) was definently NOT the best book I have read. There is almost zero percent of a wait before the romance starts. There is so much of it that it is overwhelming. I had to force myself to finish it. Sorry Ms. Hendrickson. Better Luck next time!
4,Difference of opinion,"The Reader from Boston is, of course, entitled to her opinion, with which I heartily disagree, but she should be aware that Ms. Hendrickson is probably the premier expert today on the Regency. Her reference book is a veritable bible for authors of Regency romance. For Ms. Boston's information, btw, a woman could, indeed, be a baronness in her own right, although it was rare. They could hold other titles as well, on occasion. At least one of the Duchesses of Marlborough held that title in her own right. I, personally find Ms. Hendrickson's books a delight, and her research is impeccable."
5,lala,I love doo wop music. This was a very good compilation of hits. I've bought several CD's of 50's and 60's music and this one is every bit as good. If you like doo wop music check this out. There are some songs that I had never heard but they were still very good.
3,Not quite as good as we expected,"Unfortunately, this is NOT the only doo-wop collection we'll ever need. There are many more popular (and better) doo-wop songs out there than what is on this 2-cd set. Good, just not great."
5,This cured my Doo-Wop jones...,"I doubt if this is the definitive Doo-Wop collection as implied by the title, but it is excellent. For a long time I have had a craving to buy a boxed set of Doo-Wop, but the $70+ was just too rich for my blood. This is great feel-good music at a feel-good price."
1,NOT the originals,"While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this. Rhino Records would never pull such a stunt. Go for the 4-disk Rhino box set (Vol. One) instead. You can find many high quality used versions for sale all over the web, too."
5,I Wonder Why,"This could be the best CD although it's missing ""Book Of Love"" by The Monotones but on top of that, it's a really good multi-disc album a few remakes and original recordings."
2,Sound Quality,Sound quality of the discs is poor. Seems like nothing is done to improve the audio quality of the old recordings with modern digital processing techniques.
4,Great Doo-Wop,Great Collection all on two CD's. Most compltete of the collections I previewed. Definately worth the $$.
4,Doo Wop Is Hot!,"This CD set is wonderful. I enjoy listening to the music from my ""old days"". The songs are by the original groups and they bring back fond memories."
2,Give me a Break!,"This is not the only collection you will ever need. For about the same price you can get Rhino's ""The Doo Wop Box#1""used and to really extend your collection Box #2 is a must (forget about #3 as things start getting sloppy).Someone at ""Shout Factory"" was not doing his or her homework when they set the wrong artist with certain songs,mayby they thought no one would no the difference after it was proof read. Sorry - they made a big mistake and I won't make the mistake of buying this half-baked set!""Enjoy"" JFK"
2,Some songs NOT popular ones:,Some of the songs were NOT from the performers that made them the classic hits. Had I known; I ewould NOT have ordered it.
2,YOU NEED MORE DOOWOP THAN THIS,it is not true that this is the only doowop collection you'll ever need. there is SO MUCH MORE to doowop and this doesnt show it.
4,The Only Doo Wop Collection You'll Ever Need,"The collection is great, although I don't consider some of the songs to be actual Doo Wop. The sound quality is great (much better than the original records). Being a teenager during the Doo Wop era, the collection could have contained more pure Doo Wop."
2,disappointing,I was hoping the songs were the original recordings by the original artists. Little Darlin is not the hit recording by the Diamonds. I don't know which group is singing but it's the wrong one. Disappointing.
3,beautiful!,true to color and great thread count. wished it had buttons on the bottom to secure the comforter
2,Nice shirt-- ugly logo,"I wanted a Mississippi State Bulldog shirt, but the bulldog is ugly.Be sure to look carefully at the logos before you buy. The shirt is great and the seller was wonderful."
4,I thought it was good. Same deal as the others before it.,"They all have the same generic plot to them except fordifferent mysteries. The end was actually surprisingwith it's couple of twists. I think this book is whereI end my reading of Nancy Drew. The books were goodand occupied my time in a good way. They were fastenjoyable reads that I could read in a few hours.thank you for your timeand feel free to commentthis review,Loran"
4,Good Book,"If you like mysteries, than you are sure to like this one. Nancy Drew, Bess Marvin, and Goerge Fay go to this new friends farm because someone is trying to buy her mom's farm and she doesn't want her to sell it. One night the girl told Nancy these people come and dance on her lawn sometimes. Nancy tries to figure this mystery out, but she learns she is going to need help along the way. The more touble she gets in, the more help she needs. See what happens to her by reading the story.Thanks"
4,Maybe soon a movie?,"Arbuckle wasn't the greatest but he was the first comic superstar. He was just a great clown and a really nice guy who went from a tragic childhood to stardom and back to tragedy. There is some tremendous writing here, such as ""What do you do when the world thinks you're a monster and you know it's the world that is monstrous."" Stahl also scores with, ""Everything he lost came back except the delusion that it was really his and the belief that it mattered."" Much of this portrait of Arbuckle is conjecture but it is a very believable and sympathetic portrait.If this book becomes a movie then I suggest that Roscoe can be played by Oliver Platt or Kevin James with John Goodman as his psychotic Dad."
3,Well-written but drags,"It's not a bad book, really. It just drags a bit. I never felt like I was in the head of Fatty Arbuckle telling his story. I felt, instead, like I was reading someone trying a bit too hard to speak like him. It comes off as stilted and, after a while, makes the book a chore.There's an interesting story here, especially since the subject matter is so tragic. The man was railroaded and ruined because of it. His fall from grace was an awful thing, and you really feel for the guy when you learn about his story.Unfortunately, this isn't the best telling of that story. He doesn't even make the character that likable and gets some of the historical facts completely wrong.Stahl is a great writer, so I wanted something better than this. It's slow and, frankly, just not that interesting."
3,30TH ANNIVERSARY CONFERENCE,"A major international conference on this subject was convened in 1993. It assembled virtually every significant surviving military and civilian decision maker from the USA, USSR/Russia, and Cuba: including our former SECDEF Robert McNamara and Presidential Advisor Arthur Schlesinger... Russian naval leaders and Nikita Khrushchev's son...and the Cuban officer in charge of their two batteries of nuclear-armed surface-to-surface coastal defense missiles. This gathering lasted for several days and was covered in separate 2 or 3 hour long broadcasts by every major television network in the United States. Their interview testimony and its briefly-availale transcripts provided new information dramatically different from official accounts of The Cuban Missile Crisis both before and [unfortunately] after this documentation. Military-industrial politics still controls ""history"" as it does the ""news""."
5,great remake.,"excellent remake better than the original in my opinion. All the same characters, Tony Todd was a perfect choice for Ben and the Cooper character is a bigger prick on this one than the original. Good story, very well done. I recommend this to zombie movie fans."
2,Not a very good remake.,"Normally I don't fully enjoy remakes whatsoever mainly because they don't do the original justice. The plot for this was alright, but I thought that if it was shown through the vision of how the world experiences this event rather than a house full of people, it would have been better. I also would rather that they would've made a remake of a good movie. The original I thought, was cheap garbage from a director who thinks he can make anything enjoyable. If you feel like wasting your time, see this movie."
1,I may be the only one,"I may be the only one who didnt like this movie, and thats fine with it cause people like different kinds of movies. This movie wasnt my fav because It really wasnt very much like the older verison, that one gave me chills, I didnt see it till after I saw this one but I must say the older one was better.The ending was changed which was a part I didnt really understand, he was alone in the basement(celler) and he turned to a demon he was never bit or anything and yet he turned to one of the zombies. The older one he was shot cause they though he was a zombie, and they never found him in the celler. The older one was a bit smarter then Tony Todd, I am sorry to say but it is, and if your going to make a remake of a movie wouldnt you want to have the same things?..Just try to make it more scarier to people?"
1,completely silly!,"Who would give the green light to this?It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times.Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.""Dawn of the Dead"" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.Skip this one"
1,NO REMAKE NEEDED!!!!,"this is one of those movies that you have to ask,""why remake a movie that did it right the first time!!! buy the 1968 version and forget this one! skip it!!"
1,Unwatchable,"Buy the DVD, the bluray has a terrible transfer. Everything is tinted a deep blue, which makes the entire movie look like it takes place in a room with very dim lighting. You can especially see it when a white moon shows up as dark smurf blue. I have no financial stake in trying to convince anyone this is a great product, I won't even dump my copy on Ebay as its such a poor product. I watched the first half hour, then had to switch to my DVD of this movie because I couldn't see at all what was happening in the movie.Shame on Twilight Time for releasing the worst looking bluray in my collection. Buyer beware. Search out the DVD vs Blu comparison screenshots if you need to they're accurate."
2,Mistake,"Comparing to '1968 George A. Romero's version, remake seems banal. That's the effect of changing the script. After watching the original Night Of The Living Dead watching remake is pointless: Savini is not as good director as Romero, and the tension is unfortunately not the same... What's good in this movie? Patricia Tallman as Barbra is truly charming, and make up of zombies is just excellent. But the script is, as i said, much worse than original and all movie is much less scary. There are pure american black&white characters, when in original characters were much more complicated (especially Ben and Barbra). So, if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you to see NOTLD'1968 -Romero's original. I saw sequel before seeing original: it seemed really good to me, but when I saw Romero's version...I was shocked. Two different movies, two different classes. Anyway, it's worth to see Patricia Tallman using crowbar to fight...:)"
4,Just as good as the original,"Now I know many will not agree with me but this remake was as good if not better than the original. For one, I like the Barbara character in the remake better. I also prefer the ending in the newer one. Also the graphics are of course better, which is to be expected.So go get this movie and enjoy."
3,Savini's remake of Romero's classic is good.,"Tom Savini gives his motion picture directing debut with Night of the Living Dead, a 1990 remake that tries to add some more gore, but is ultimately hindered by the MPAA's strict R policy, which has lightened up since, considering films like DOTD 2004 is much more grisly than this one, which cuts away after a half second of gore to satisfy the MPAA. Would have given this four stars had Savini created an unrated director's cut.Still, he stays true to Romero's classic, adding color and a few new concepts here and there, like a strong heroine rather than Barbara being a squeamish little mouse like in Romero's original.The zombies look good, but this could use more gore and guts for zombie fans to feast on. Nonetheless, a solid, though somewhat repeated entry into the zombie genre. The original still rules, but this is a nice compliment worth noting."
5,Just as good as the original,"I like both versions equally. The original had atmosphere, the remake had better looking zombies. All in all, I highly recommend this movie. Check it out!"
2,A weak film,"I don't care if those zombies look real or not, this film isn't particularly scary. It's moderately suspenseful, but has no eerie scenes that raise the hair on the back of your neck. And despite what many others say, I still think the zombies in Day of the Dead are a better looking design then this Night of the Living Dead remake. Most of the problem in this film is the acting. The only one that's actually good is Tony Todd as the hero, Ben. His character remains mostly calm and cool and tries to help the others with him. However, the rest of the cast I can't say much. Patricia Tallman was not bad but also wasn't very good. If you want to watch a good zombie movie, watch Dawn and Day of the Dead."
2,Not as good as the hyped reviews,"I bought this and the original. My kids and I sat down to watch the original, and even my 7-year-old daughter got unnerved. But this remake I watched with my fiance. I was really disappointed. The acting was horrendous, and I just don't understand all the rave reviews on amazon. I have to admit the first 20 minutes are entertaining, but afterwards the cheesiness of the film wasn't even a ""cool"" cheesiness. It was annoying. Rent it, but it's not worth buying in my opinion."
4,show the entire movie,"Currently, the movie start with Barbara and her brother enroute to the graveyard. However years ago, the movie started with the introduction of the first, the one zombie walking through the graveyard. He was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial, execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in Barbara's direction. I don't know why they edited this part out. It gave the movie a little more substance., ,"
4,Night of the living dead,"Super classic, a must own for zombie fans. However when I was little I didn't recall wanting to punch the blonde chick in the face that screams way to much and way to loud in this movie."
2,(Yawn),"Acting = Horrible!! Tony Todd was ""ehhh.. so-so"" but the rest of the cast deserved to be zombie chow for their lack of acting ability in a film that could have been soooooooooo much better!! Add the casting director as well. The only reason I watched it until the end was to teach myself a lesson for buying it, lol. My advice: skip it!"
5,Excellent Remake! Thanks Tom!!,"Tom Savini pulled it off...to make a spooky, creepy, dead film!!I especially like the sound track during the film...that soft, twingy, sound during the moon rise at the beginning and other times in the film.For me, that spells SPOOKY man!! Where is Tom now and when is his next collaboration with George?RM Leal"
4,Savini know's how to do a Romero remake with style,"Usually remakes are terrible, but not in this case. Savini had Romero on board as a producer and really did not deviate from the original NOTLD. He found a way to mordernize the film and stay true to it's integrity. He did change things a little mostly the ending but did it a way that left Romaro fans very happy. Savini's respect for George Romero is seen in this remake. Weather it is Martin or Dawn of the dead the Savini/Romero team really shine. The movie opens much like the original and stay's remotely close to the original movie for most of the film. Of course Savini throws in his own changes and the final plot twist is different from the original NOTLD. Savini show's promise as a horror movie director here and as always the special affects are great for the era."
1,Avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Bad transfer on Blu-ray. The blu-ray transfer is very dark and has a blue tint. Do not waste your money.
1,really BAD Sony transfer.,"Saw a friend's copy of this and the difference between the DVD and this bluray is like night and day - pun intended - someone over at Sony when transferring this disc made the entire movie so utterly dark - it renders the disc nearly unwatchable. Granted the film is supposed to take place at night, the new transfer is quite frankly awful."
4,one of the best remakes ever,follows almost perfectly the plot of the powerful unforgettable oringal. pays good respect and homage to romero whom himself was even involved.in some ways i think this was better made than the oringal but still nuthin beats the classic one.
3,Good flick. But it ain't the original!!,I really enjoyed Tom Savini's shot at NIGHT. But the master Romero's is the measuring stick for all the Zombie flicks. I really did enjoy the way Savini changed the roles around at the end. Like making the girl become the Tough SOB! And how she gets the A-hole right between the eyes in the end. While it is not as good as the original or DAWN. It is a must for the collector that has the DEAD TRILOGY.
5,Tom savini did a great gob I love it,George a Romero my favorite director of all time made the og version and he trusted savini to direct the remake it and it was awesome.savini did a great job with this film he put his own twist on it I loved it if you have not seen it see it buy it now you will not be disappointed if you liked the og you will want to watch this one great zombie movie savini is awesome
5,GREAT IDEA!,This a better film than 68 version in every way! Best of all color! I was starting to think it might never hit DVD. Thank god
3,""" There coming to get you Barbara!""","A worthy remake which was enjoyable. Directed by make up man Tom Savini this is the original tale of zombies.Stars Tony Todd (Candyman, The Crow) and a cast of unknowns. The ending is fairly good if somewhat tragic."
5,"Move over, Ms. Weaver","Although this movie is based on George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, it felt very different. Perhaps it is my failure to appreciate 1960s era characterization and pacing. Here, you have two strong characters, male and female. The transformation of the female character is a bit surprising (how does she turn into a crack shot?). I do feel that her emotional transformation is congruent. She's finally externalized her personal demons, and realized they can be overcome by shooting them in the head. What was she before the movie started? A nurse? Social worker? Secretary? Regardless, she overcomes a lifetime of waiting and enduring to come out with guns blazing against obstacles. ""What I was is dead now"". Go girl. If only she was in the sequel, much like the Aliens saga followed Ripley."
4,Better than the original and STILL not on Netflix library!!!,"I'm a HUGE zombie fan and can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that Savini's remake here is a heck-of-a-lot better movie than the original. Not just in effects and dialogue (which are still two good points) but also in the storyline as well. Unfortunately there isn't a good DVD put out that gives this movie much care for by adding a great digital picture, clear soundtrack and cool bonus features that most DVD's have today. Maybe nearing the 2010 mark there will be a ""collector's edition"" or something to mark the 20th anniversary. I still can't believe Netflix doesn't have this movie in their library. I e-mailed them on it a couple of times but to no avail, so i ended up buying this bad copy here on amazon. I guess i can't complain, it's still better than watching it on the vhs i have. :)"
4,Worthy Remake,"I really enjoyed this remake written by the master himself, george romero. I liked the character devlopment better, and these are some of the best zombies i've seen. I only wished that savini had gotten to film his extra stuff and make an unrated version. That would have been great. I liked this film, honorable to the original, but with good enhancements, some I find better."
3,Good remake.,"I found this movie to be pretty good, but not as gripping as the original. The special effects are better, the movie is well acted and keeps up the pace, however I tend to still like the original one better, but I cannot put my finger on why I feel so. Overall: GOOD."
4,"Ok ok, so it's in color...","I've been a fan of George A. Romero from a long time, and when I saw the remake of NOTLD by Tom Savini... WOW! Tom is good!OK, the camera angles, and the attitude of all characters are a little bit different, but this version gave me the creeps!The ending is excellent!Watch it!"
3,Review of Tom Savini's remake,"Interesting but unnecessary remake of Romero's original. Neither as scary or gory as the first film which was released about 22 years prior. If you enjoyed the first film and are a zombie movie fan, there is no reason for you not to like this one but if you have not seen the original, watch it first, because this one really doesn't do it justice.This is an entertaining film and worth watching but aside from the fact that the original creators needed to make some money, there really isn't any reason for this one. It's alright but it does not add much to the story. Tony Todd (""Candyman"") is great in the lead."
4,Not bad for a remake,I have never been much of a fan of remakes or sequels but I didn't think this one was so bad. It stars Tony Todd(Candyman) and has the same plot as the original. Maybe I'm partial to this one because it's done in color and I belive the special effects are better. The movie overall is creepy and wastes no time in getting to the good stuff. Of course in most horror movies there isn't much of a storyline but if you wanted a storyline you wouldn't be watching a horror flick. If you saw the original Night of the Living Dead I believe you should see this version as well and compare for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
3,LOW BUDGET MOVIE WITH BEST AND SHARP PICTURE,"I have bought this DVD released by Columbia Picture (a regional coded 3 disc) and the picture is shap and very good. Good Transfer for a low budget movie but the sound effect, some disturbance(if you hear it with headphone). The movie is not scary but funny."
2,Obsolete,"Obsolete remake, indeed. From the very beginning this film is a bad joke. The terrible non-stop screaming from the women makes you want to see them become zombie-food as fast as possible. Barbara's brother in this film is an i.d.i.o.t., blablaing his text down already in the arriving-scene inside the car. George must have thought: Well, let's have Tom bullfrogging his ego with a remake, it will always be... this. I don't wanna be mean to Mr. Savini, I really appreciate his work, his acting in some films too, but this here: Was a mistake. Or, I miss the point and this was meant as a comedy, but nevertheless, I say it doesn't work."
2,Why?,"Maybe Savini, who is a horror f/x master will one day get to remake Fulci's Zombie and instead of having all the Zombies walking on the bridge he'll have them dancing and skipping as they hold hands. It's a more Hollywood ending much like his Hollywood ending in this re-make. I'd expect this from someone outside the genre but not a guy like Savini!I'm currently fearing the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and both Dawn and Day of the Dead! All 3 are getting remade and I fear what will become of these classic films. Re-makes are made for a whole new audience that wasn't able to get the thrills of when the original came out or maybe for those who haven't seen the original! Why re-make a film when you are going to change everything good about it?"
4,Worthy Remake,"While remakes rarely come close to the quality of their original versions, Tom Savini has done an excellent job with his take on ""Night of the Living Dead."" Some of the classic lines are revisited in this version, such as ""They're dead, they're all messed up"" and the famous ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" Savini obviously has a passion for the ""living dead"" and takes good care of the franchise.-A DemonUser Review"
1,Garbage,Never buy this; it worked about 1 week. I will never buy that again. I can't find another similar pump yet.
2,NO illustrations inthe kindle edition,"AS delightful as this story is, it is far more delightful when illustrated. The no-charge price? You get what you pay for."
5,"A wonderful, funny children's book for all ages",A book bought by my grandmother on a trip to Australia when I was 6 years old (30 years ago). I enjoyed it thoroughly as a child and have just finished reading it to my seven year old daughter who couldn't wait to get through it. I highly recommend for anyone who loves well written fair.
3,SNAFU,"""I still believe the man with the white hat wins in the end - & I intend to prove it."" I can identify with that desire to stand up for justice & righteousness. But still this movie ends on a flat note. There's no assurance at all that in this case ""the man with the white hat"" will prevail. In fact, looking at this film 25 years later & assessing the current situation of England it looks to me that that nation is on the road to being a ""has been,"" if it isn't already. But then the US is travelling a similar road it seems."
2,Suspension of disbelief suspended,"Sorry, I couldn't buy the ending. Such a loose cannon enters the house of a closely monitored spy, and none the wiser? Unless..."
3,Swimsuit Analyzer,"This video is ok, not the best i've ever seen of Kathy. If you like seeing women in swimsuits and you like Kathy Ireland get this one."
3,The Cow Theory!!!,"Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd) bumps into Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear) who she falls in love with. Before she knows it she is tied in an emotional roller-coaster where she is emotionally and financially committed. However, Ray dumps her in a sly selfish manner and it leads her to a cynical introspective theory of why guys want women, which she decides to investigate and publish in an anonymous editorial column. Someone Like You provides an opportunity to observe pessimistic introspection in action through the lens of humor, which in the end leaves the audience with an entertaining episode in Jane's life."
3,Fluff,"This extremely lightweight comedy/romance is not very interesting but the actors are likable and there are a few (mind you, A FEW) laughs along the way. The plot is very thin indeed and the whole scenario with Judd researching bovine behavior to explain the actions of men never really catches on or clicks with the audience. The movie is so predictable and boring that I kept waiting for the Ellen Barkin scenes to try and figure out what on earth she has done to herself to look completely different (never did figure this out although I'm sure a knife was involved). The film also brings another question to mind and that is why Marisa Tomei is not used more often and to better advantage?"
3,Hugh rules the screen,"I picked this movie up after work the day of it's VHS release thinking that I would fall in love with it. I like Ashley Judd and though I cannot stand Greg Kinnear I also ""adore"" Hugh Jackman since his arrival in X-Men and wanted to give it a try.I guess...I wished there was either more to it or the parts that WERE in it were just played out better. I was disappointed in Ashley's Judd's character and her ""Old Cow"" routine. It got a little...sickening. Not that I didn't agree on some fronts but the whole movie was about her selfishness and pity party.Hugh Jackman was a good time almost classical ""jerk"" sometimes which made him adorable but I think he was the one that lit the stage in this performance. Ashley either should have left the role to ""Someone Else"" or...fought with the director to change her character..."
3,Average all around,"This movie isn't too bad. But, it's not the best, either. I don't have any real complaints about the acting. I don't have any real complaints about anything, other than the story line being predictable. This movie just didn't keep my attention very well. If you are the kind of person that loves romantic comedies, then this is probably for you. Others might become a little bit bored with it."
4,"Darling, definitly a 'sleepover' type movie....","I saw this movie in theaters with a girlfriend of mine, and it was thought provoking (in a fun loving boys suck sort of way) and was just all over cute. Another movie that comes to mind when i think about it is bridget jones diary."
2,Not a complete product,"I was disappointed because the video noted a directors cut for the movie, which is my favorite selection, but when I try to see it the movie just goes back to main menu. I have always liked the movie but am not happy with the product because there are selections missing."
5,Love it,When I was younger and single I would watch Someone Like You a lot to understand why my relationships ended. Sometimes I would learn what I did or did not do right. Sometimes I just wouldn't understand what went wrong. Either way this is a good movie.
3,"Great movie, a little slow at times.","This movie was very sweet, good romantic comedy. Sometimes the plot line was a little slow and it could have been a little better. Still, if you're looking for a cute, romantic comedy- this is your movie."
3,Pretty much only worth watching because of Hugh Jackman,"This movie was a basic romantic comedy, very predictable. Ashley Judd and Marisa Tomei's characters are actually rather annoying at the beginning of the film, the type of women who will sleep with a man and fall head over heels supposedly in love, and then get her heart broken, and do this over and over again with men. I was annoyed with Jane and Ray beginning a relationship because he was already in a 3 year relationship with someone else ( dont act surprised when the guy turns out to be a jerk, come on!). Fortunately though both Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman are very good looking characters and the idea that they are going to be together in the end saves it. The end was not as great as it could have been though. And thankfully, she proves her cow theory wrong.."
2,Not for everyone,"If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others."
4,Enjoyable Love Move,I was pleased with my movie selection and the services rendered was AWESOME. The product was received timely and in great condition. I would definitely buy from this vendor again.
4,Fun movie for guys and girls,"This is a cute movie that digs into the relationship mind of men. The plot was good but a little predictable. Ashley Judd does a good job plus shows off her body in tasteful, everyday attire. This movie is worth full price at the movies."
2,"Good actors, awful script","I was warned that this was a bad movie but rented it anyway, figuring that a movie with Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman, Greg Kinear, and Marisa Tomei could not be all bad. I was wrong, wrong, wrong!The story is disjointed and pointless; the characters were terribly underdeveloped and shallow. None of them were really very likeable, especially the men.I realize that the movie was from the book ""Animal Husbandry"" but the cow and bull stuff just did not work. The whole movie was just plain excruciating.What also did not work was the love triangle, perhaps because both men were slimy weasels. Who would want either of them, cute though they are?There are many better romantic comedies out there......unfortunately I cannot put this movie into that category."
4,A MAGNIFICENT CHICK FLICK.,Hugh Jackman is magnificent. Very handsome and irresistable. Someone like you is a movie about a woman named Jane (Judd) who thought she had figured out what was wrong with men until she met Mr. Right. Very predictable and cute movie. A MAGNIFICENT CHICK FLICK.
3,"Young professional wants a boyfriend...with ""matching volvos and chocolate labs""","Although his name is not advertised on the product, Hugh Jackman's, Eddie, is the real reason to watch this movie. Eddie is an honest womanizer. But, it's Eddie who brings heart to this story, and offers Ashley Judd's, Jane, an antidote to Greg Kinnear's nice, sensitive, and...dishonest boyfriend. If you're a romantic comedy junky this is a fun, lightweight, pleasant distraction... You probably won't watch this a hundred times, but you will enjoy it again."
5,great movie,Love this movie! recived it fast and in perfect shape and for a great price. If u like ashly judd this is one of her best shes very cute in this movie
4,LOVE ASHLEY JUDD MOVIES,I LOVE TO WATCH ASHLEY JUDD ACT.SHE IS SO DOWN TO EARTH.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL. I SURE LIKE THIS MOVIE
3,"Stupid Women, Pointless Choices","Ashley Judd plays a self-absorbed, self-centered woman who can't see anything beyond her own pain. Apparently she can't even see that her ""ideal"" love is a cypher with no personality or defining characteristics. Greg Kinnear's character may well have been dynamic and romantically compelling, but the script certainly didn't let him show it. As a result, the audience has trouble identifying with Judd's character or even caring about her plight. There is nothing special about her predicament, which makes me wonder why I should spend time watching this movie. (Answer: I was on a long plane trip.)Even Jackman, who gets more screen time, doesn't really get to develop his character. The result is a less-than-compelling foray into the self-obsessed world of semi-glamorous single people."
4,Sweet Little Movie,"I know that this movie got ""mixed reviews,"" whatever that means, but I found it charming and sweet and rather touching at some parts. I enjoyed the DVD for all the extras, too. I loved listening to Hugh Jackman with a different accent than his native Australian, and the oh so proper English accent he used in that other romantic movie he was recently in.""Someone. . ."" touches on so many emotions, and Ashley Judd is funny and manic, and her comic timing is great. I am very happy that I bought this movie. Don't miss the cheerleader scene. Hugh Jackman was gorgeous."
4,Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;),"I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?"
4,An endearing romantic comedy...,"Star quality and old-fashioned sex-appeal are the highlights of Someone Like You, a fairly predictable romantic comedy than nonetheless tugs at the heartstrings with surprising effectiveness. Ashley Judd is Jane, a talent-booker for a talk show host who has her heart broken by the show's producer (Greg Kinnear). To spite her ex, Jane moves in with Eddie (Hugh Jackman) another staffer who needs a roommate. The results, of course, are predictable. We all know that Jane and Eddie are bound for romance, but the screen-sizzle between Judd and Jackman is more than worth it. Also worth the price are the special features on the DVD, which include an alternate ending which, thankfully, was not used.While Someone Like You won't win any points for originality, it does score big-time for romance and chuckles. While it's definitely not Oscar-quality, it is probably worth owning, especially for the occasional romantic date night."
3,"so-so plot, but oh, that Hugh Jackman!","Those who have called this movie ""formulaic"" described it perfectly--within 15 minutes of the start of the picture, a person paying the slightest bit of attention could tell how the movie would end. However, I did not go to see this movie for the plot--after I saw ""X-Men"" last year, I wondered what Hugh Jackman was like under the hair. Wonder no more, the man has a definite presence--even, one might say, ""charisma""! I just wish that this movie was more worthy of his talents. Despite the movie's flaws, I can think of a lot of other films that were real time-wasters. At least this one had some decent acting by the cast, and some nice scenery. (New York City AND Mr. Jackman!)"
5,"Great Movie, Sweet Price",This is a great romantic comedy to watch with your special someone. The cast is wonderful and keeps you engaged throughout the film.
3,It's all about the other guy,"A very cute movie, which in the first hour or so is very clever and funny; Ashley Judd has surprisingly good comic timing and Greg Kinnear is not as irritating as I have often found him to be. It stumbles a bit near the end-- too much time seems to have been spent on the set-up and not enough on the pay-off; still, it's worthwhile and women everywhere will empathise with the main character's plight.The reason to watch, though, can be summed up in six words: Hugh Jackman, Hugh Jackman, Hugh Jackman. This is the first time that many people will have seen Jackman on film, and here's hoping that it's the first of many; the man is electric in any role he takes."
3,No chemistry between Jackman & Judd... Judd doing Meg Ryan!,"I enjoyed the movie, but it just didn't ""click"". Jackman and Judd had nothing going then suddenly they were madly in love. I thought maybe Greg Kinnear & Hugh Jackman should have switched roles. And there should have been more story-building between the two romantic leads. It just wasn't believable. The kiss between Judd & Jackman was so boring I wanted to snore. Judd and Kinnear had real chemistry. And Judd's comedic acting seemed like the director was telling her ""act like Meg Ryan""."
4,Charming Perfomances!,"Not a great film nor is it very original but Someone Like You is a very charming look at trying to find Mr Right. Ashley Judd looks breathtaking and takes her role and gives her the right amount of strength, charm, and intelligence in what could have a been a very boring pathetic role. Greg Kinnear does what he can with a badly written role. Hugh Jackman is charming and likeable as the womanizing roomate of Ashely Judd. The chemistry between the two is amazing and it's the one thing that really carries the film. I only wish the film focused more on the relationship between these two then between the relationship between Ashley and Greg. It has a predictable and happy ending and is certain to please all lovers of romantic comedies."
2,Can we say - Character & Relationship Development,"I picked this because of Hugh and Ashley. Greg i figured would be the middle guy in this triangle. Ummmm ok next time more Hugh, less Greg and Ashley could be less shrewish. I hated seeing her like that. And how is she in love with Hugh all of a sudden? yes others have said that, glad to see I wasn't the only one thinking ""hugh"" where did that come from, even though we knew it would be there but come on! Even the obvious has some relationship development. And why did he get all mad at the end? Bizarre!"
2,Drivel,"I don't like to brag, but I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of movies and whether they're good or not. I wasn't expecting a blockbuster of a movie, or anything, but MY GOODNESS, this movie was awful! One could ask themselves, ""What's wrong with this movie?"" But the answer itself is the very broad question, ""What isn't?"" Ashley Judd plays strong, sexy women very well, but she does NOT convince me when she plays a character whom is heart-broken and borderline desperate.Not only is Judd's character not believable, the actual plot pertaining to men behaving like cows who need many ""places"" to plant their seeds is just stupid. There are about a million and a half romantic comedies that are better than this, and I recommend all of them wholeheartedly over this joke of a film.Watch A Walk to Remember instead. Although not the best movie ever, it's a heck of alot better than this drivel."
3,Hugh & Ashley can be funny - but not here.,"Books are books, movies are movies...never the twain shall...well you get the idea.Hugh jackman can be a very funny sexy guy and ashley Judd is a great comedian, but this is not the best of scripts."
2,Not worth watching more than once.,"This movie just didn't connect with me that well. It had some pretty funny parts, but is was just a little too crazy/weird for me. The ending was a little too unrealistic for me as well. I think the actors did well with what they were given."
4,A nice movie,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first."
3,problem in 1 track,"The case, insert and the disc arrived in perfect condition. But one track is not good, the disc stuck in these song and I have to manualy move forward."
5,"It's the Alarm, need I say any more........","With out a dought, one of the BEST groups of my youth. I'm now thirty years old and I cherish the memories of their music, their concerts in San Francisco. I'm shocked to have read some of the comments made by ""fans"". One of my best memories was getting the chance to meet them one night in SF. LOVE The Alarm!! Signed, Staci Dube' of Silicon Valley, Calif."
4,Welsh power,"Funny that people would compare the Alarm to U2, when the former is Welsh and the latter is Irish.I got into this band with its spiky hair, harmonicas and revolutionary zeal and got swept away. ""Strength"" still has to be one of the Top 20 greatest, most passionate songs ever. ""Give me hope, give me strength, give me something to live for ... Who will light the fire that I need to survive, who will be the lifeblood coursing through my veins, won't someone open up the door and let me out of this place. I've been caged up for so long, I don't know if I'm living or I'm dying.""Those words really drove a spike into my teen angst-filled heart in the '80s and continue to stir my emotions.Like the Alarm there were so many thoughtful bands with great lyrics. They were out to change the world. In some ways, they made me who I am today. Yahoo."
4,Dave Sharp Standing Tall,The Alarm wrote some socially potent songs in their time and they still resonate now. One of the forgotten bands from a period that is better off forgotten they are one of the diamonds in the rough. I have had the opportunity to meet Dave Sharp who is still playing his hard traveling music. I reccomend you check him out if you are ever in New Orleans. Just swing by the Kerry Irish Pub.
3,M.O.R. remixes ruin their best work,"Although some of the early classics like ""68 Guns"" and ""Where Were You Hiding"" have escaped relatively unscathed, the incomprehesible move of remixing and re-recording songs like ""The Stand"" and ""Blaze of Glory"" from their powerful originals to boppy Top40-style tones and beats seriously damages both the quality and credibility of this album. The inclusion of much of their toothless later material doesn't help either. If you never heard the Alarm's first album ""Declaration"" in all its glory, you may enjoy ""Standards"", but if you remember the power of the original versions, you're in for a big disappointment. The only saving grace for this album is that, with ""Declaration"" now unavailable, there's nowhere else you can find ANY version of what were some of the greatest songs of my youth."
2,flippy floppys #2,"These were stretched out when I received them. I received them quickly, and was able to return them with no problem. They even gave me a shipping label I did not have to pay for, and then received the refund quickly."
2,disapointed,The information in this book did not help me at all. The condition of the book was good but wasn't what I needed.
1,fix formatting in kindle version,The equations are incomplete and it becomes very hard to read. Have tried on multiple devices. mathematical formatting is not complete. Very disappointing. Particularly the bras and kets.
3,Style over substance.,"Feynman was one of the most accomplished physicists in the 2nd half of the 20th century. His publications speak for themselves. However, as represented in this set of lecture notes, I do not find him as a pedagogue more enlightening than others. I bought and read this book in grad school, and found it to be a nice quick intro to several topics (spin waves and such). I did not, and still don't find the exposition physically exceptionally profound. One difference though, is the fact that Feynman, with his fame, could afford to be rather informal in his presentation. Any unsatisfactory aspects would be accepted as the mysterious ways of a 'genius'. If you are a student and would like to learn to solve problems on your own, forget this one. What this book gives you is a little 'attitude', aside from a quick intro, which most of us haven't earned the right to put on, of doing physics. Try it. Try to be as unorthodox and informal as he was, and you will mostly end up with nonsense."
4,"Nice, safe scent","Nice scent which should appreciated by most: light, slightly sweet floral with reasonably good staying power.. But it isn't ethereal ...on me, at least. I prefer Jo Malone's Orange Blossom and JM's latest: White Jasmine and Mint."
5,The Ultimate Foreigner Collection,"This CD is a great compilation. It's got a lot of familiar Foreigner hits, but what really sets it apart are the tracks from Lou Gramm and some lesser known Foreigner material. The sound is exceptional as well. I don't know if there was any remastering done or not, but it sure sounds like it. A lot of these songs have never sounded better. It is pricey though."
5,A Spiritual Workbook,"Even more than its two excellent predecessors (""The Invitation"" and ""The Dance"") the third book of Oriah's trilogy is a handbook on how to live. While influences of both the Sufis and Lao-Tze (Taoist) are present, the voice is clearly unique and powerfully original. Grounding her teachings in stories from her life, Oriah marshalls a persuasive argument that the core issue in our lives and our relation to Spirit is not that we need to do more, but that we need to accept who we are. The meditations offer clear and practical steps towards accomplishing that.This is a practical book, that can be enjoyed whatever the reader's religious views are. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I read the first two books by the same author ""The Invitation"" and ""The Dance"" and very much enjoyed them. I had been looking forward to the this book but when I read it I must say I was completely disappointed!!! The first two books had encouraged one to look within oneself for answers but this I found deeply religious as it encouraged worship of a god which does not resonate with me at all."
2,Not the Best,"Even though I have had approx. 6 months of tap dancing class so I know many of the basic steps, I found this book and CD difficult to use. I believe the author is not very successful at describing how to tap dance using words. I think that beginners would really struggle to understand what they are supposed to be doing."
3,Teach yourself tap dancing,"Who ever needs some help in tap, this is an ideal book to do so. The video could be better"
3,WORDY,I found the wording a little difficult to follow especially the instructions under 05 with the circles etc. It is a good book but NOT the sort of Basic book I was expecting.IO will try to persevere but I am not finding it as simple as the author says it is as the instructions are not really clear.Paul D.
4,Re: Doc Hollywood,"The movie is funny, entertaining and well performed. My wife & I laughed a lot during the film & wish Hollywood would make more films like this one. Except for possibly one nude scene, the whole family could watch it."
5,Doc Hollywood,"This is a fun, feel good movie about small town living and the people who live in them. Loved this movie and have watched it 3 times. It's a movie that has some really funny lines that you will miss unless you watch it serval times. I'm a big Michael J. Fox fan."
3,Great Movie - Poor DVD - Better on iTunes,"I love this movie! I've tried a couple of DVDs and both are poor quality, low resolution and full frame. I took a chance on iTunes, even though the preview was full frame. The downloaded movie is WIDESCREEN at 845 x 480 and very nice quality."
1,Read the SMALL print!,"Everyone is correct, the movie is a great movie. The problem is in the Amazon descriptions, or lack thereof. This movie has been EDITED! I can't understand why, it was a good wholesome movie in the first place. Amazon should make this information more prominent. We watched the movie and that was how we found out it was edited....what a waste of money. I won't buy anymore movies from Amazon."
3,"wonderful film, horrible video quality","Michael J. Fox at his best, which is very good indeed. I agree with the many other reviewers that the quality of the video is horrible, the worst in my collection of 400 discs. Please, we beg you, petition the studio to produce a BluRay version so richly deserved by this fine film."
3,"Nice film, poor DVD","The film is truly fun thanks to Michael Fox, with enjoyable performances by several of the cast. But the DVD is nothing more than a VHS tape on DVD: Full screen, 2-channel AC-3, unremarkable picture quality, and no extras. If you want a videotape you don't have to rewind, this is it."
3,Doc Hollyeood,"Not a bad movie, but I thought it would be funnier. All the actors were good. The movie was good. I did not think it was as funny as I thought it would be. But, a good addition to my collection"
1,I'm rating the dvd only.,"I had this DVD for a while, and thought I'd come here and comment on how awful the transfer is. I've seen better quality on normal TV without a cable/sat. Connection. The picture is extremely dark in the hospital scene in the beginning. Then there is a lot of grain and I've seen wood with less grain. The grain makes the scene even darker then it should be. Then when he's out of the hospital and on the road, the grain is still very noticeable. I love the movie, but this DVD is just horrible. Sadly there aren't any features on the disc either, so buying the VHS is so much better if you actually like this movie.Transfer 0.5/5Audio 3/5Features 0/5I really hope that the studio that released this film decides to re-release it and do a better job at it. It's not even worth the cheap price."
1,Returned twice,"WHEN I RECEIVED MY FIRST ""DOC HOLLYWOOD DVD"" I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE MOVIE, THEN I REQUESTED TO HAVE IT REPLACE AND WHEN I GOT IT THE 2ND TIME IT WAS THE EXACLY THE SAME PROBLEM. SO I RETURNED AND REQUESTED MY MONEY BACK, SORRY I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS SELLER."
2,Scanned from VHS?,"This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version."
5,A real Gem ...must own movie !,"This is one of my all time favorite movies & should be in everyone's collection. The main reason for my review though is I found an older brief mention of this info on another website ...but, a PAL format ""Amorphoric Widescreen"" Doc Hollywood was released in March 2006. I ordered it from Amazon.com.uk for the total price of $10.00 (3.99 + shipping) & received my order here in the U.S. approx. 9 days later.Here is a direct link:[...]It's kinda strange [...] doesn't list the aspect ratio (it's 1:85:1) or that's it's widescreen ...however, even though it's in PAL format ...this is your only choice for now if you that want to own this awsome movie in Amorphoric Widescreen !"
4,"Cute, Light Romantic Commedy","If you like romantic comedies, you'll enjoy ""Doc Hollywood"". Starring Michael J. Fox, it is everything you would want in a romatic comedy, with attractive, likeable stars and talented, interesting supporting characters...and a cute pig.I watched it with my two teenage daughters - it ended with us all smiling!One note: My daugthers pointed out how the recent animated movie ""Cars"" seemed to be based on exactly the same story line."
3,Rewatchable Story -Only a fair transfer,"The film is charming but I was always disappointed with the transfers to VHS I had seen. So when it came out in DVD, I jumped on it. Sad to say, they must have used the same copy for both transfers. It remains enjoyable. The line to listen for is when Woody is in Hollywood and is asked (off camera) ""Isn't that a movie star?"" He replies (off-camera) ""No, it's just Ted Danson."""
4,One of michael j. fox's best!,"The only movie in my belief that surpasses this one is ""The secret of my success"". If you like a good down home country turned city movie then this one will be a must see over and over!"
3,LOOK OUT! HERE COMES NURSE PACKER!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS ENJOYABLE. MICHAEL J. FOX IS GOOD, BUT TOO ""ALEX KEATON"" (FAMILY TIES)...VERY PREDICTABLE. I PERSONALLY ENJOYED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TRULY DELIGHTFUL CHARACTER ACTRESS EDYE BYRDE, WHO ALSO APPEARED IN THE FILM ""MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON"" AND IN THE DAYTIME SOAP OPERA ""ANOTHER LIFE"" BACK IN THE EARLY 80S. TO ME, SHE WAS THE STAR. SORRY. MICHAEL J. FOX BUT YOU WERE UPSTAGED BY THIS TREASURE OF AN ACTRESS. LOVE YA, EDYE!"
5,The best hand-drawn Disney movie,"What a nice DVD set! In my view this is Disney's best animated movie, at least until WALL-E. It's scary, and has some adult themes, but those elements give it great replay value. The extra features are good, especially the commentary."
1,No sure if satisfied yet,Wrote to ask if movie was in italian or english...opened to see after no reply..will not play in our DVD so going to try a brand new one my daughter has. If works and is in English we will keep it. If it in Italian or it does not work in their dvd we will be sending it back.Stewart Schofield
3,Pinnochio,Great movie. Poor DVD. Brand new and it skips and gets stuck in about 5 places throughout the movie. Was a little disappointed that a new product would come that way.
3,100% satisfactory Or Full Refund,"All of the disc were NOT in the case.But I was fully refunded..And Very,Very satisfied with that..thank you and that will NOT effect any future purchases from Amazon..Amazon stands behind their word "" 100% Satisfaction OR A Full Refund""....Thank You again...Rosie Davis"
3,Defective DVD?,"Am I the only one that cannot find a DVD copy without a defect on the left side of the screen during certain points in the film? You can't tell on traditional DVD components (which crop off a good 2 inches of the viewable image), but if you watch it on your computer (the entire screen image), you will see a blurred left side at various scenes, (note: the first Honest John & Pinoccio encounter). Where can I find a good copy? I also agree with the public... where's the making-of extra, if it's on video? That's outrageous! The film itself gets 5 stars, the DVD release only 2 stars."
5,A masterpiece...now and always,"Pinocchio is just one of those stories that appeals to everyone, young or old. And Disney told a wonderful version of it with this animated feature. It looks incredible on Blu-ray, and there are many great special features included. Highly recommended."
2,Wonderful Disney classic but disappointing version (Pinocchio 1999 Gold Edition),"This was undoubtedly Disney's finest work, however the 1999 ""Gold Edition"" of Pinocchio is a disappointment. Not only was this transfer taken from unrestored film elements but they optically enlarged the picture to fill a 16:9 HD screen. By changing the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio to 1.85:1, they managed to cut off the top and bottom of the picture, resulting in a very grainy image.With no extras other than the original theatrical trailer, my question is: What qualifies this to be a ""Gold Edition""? My advise is, pay a few extra dollars and get the newest edition, it's worth it."
4,Old Classic,"The DVD played fine without any skips or errors. I have not seen this in over thirty years. It's a good old classic from Disney. My memory might be old but I seem to recall certain scenes seem to be shorter or not there. Oh well, engineers have to play too I guess. Now if Disney would get off their rear ends and release "" Song of the South"" That'd be a feat."
5,Classic,Love Disney movies and love this story. Have added this to my growing collection of Disney movies.
3,"Too expensive for the package, but....",This is the best this movie is ever going to look. AND STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LACK OF WIDESCREEN! Most movies made before 1960 were shot in full-screen! It would be totally useless to transfer Pinocchio to widescreen because it wasn't filmed that way!
2,Disapointing to see a half-a@# job done on the DVD version.,"I love Pinocchio. I was so excited to hear it was being released on DVD. Heck, I was happy just to hear any classic Disney animation was going to be finally released on DVD. However, what disappoints me is that this DVD seems to be thrown together without any extra effort put in it to make it special. The DVD version is not in widescreen (like the laserdisk versions are) and it is missing ""the making of"" that is found on the VHS version. Why are these things missing and why are we paying more for the DVD version without any of the extras practically found on all other DVDs?"
2,no extra features!,"I would review the movie just the DVD! First of all there are no making of, storyboard,production notes or any extra features ! The only extra feature you get with this DVD is the trailer! Oh, did I mention that the DVD has beautiful picture on it! Rent it first ,then buy at Disney outragous price that they want for this DVD! Just watch later on Disney will reissue it (and the others in their collection with all the extras this DVD lack! If you want those extra features stick with the studios Disney owns! They are Miramax,Dimension,Hollywood Pictures,Touchstones Pictures,ABC network,Anchor Bay and Walt Disney Pictures! I hope this info helps others looking for disney movies other than the animated movies!"
1,Terrible customer service,"I'll admit, I mistakenly bought this item without reading all the details, which I rarely do. I knew nothing about different codes for different areas (stupid BTW). I paid a sensational amount for shipping thinking I was still getting a decent deal. The product showed up as advertised, albeit I felt the seller was a bit deceitful by not highlighting that this disc is not compatible with US DVD/Bluray players. I attempted to contact the seller to return the item a month ago and haven't received a response. That's bad business and deserves a 1 rating on ethics alone. Don't get duped by this seller. You won't be able to get your money back."
1,DOES NOT PLAY ON MY REGULAR DVD,"I am so upset right now! this DVD does not play on my regular DVD player. The cover of the DVD is printed in Italy, the DVD comes and was shipped from Italy. I wanted the English version, as of now, i do not know if the DVD's audio is in English or Italian because it doesn't work AT ALL. Maybe if i was leaving in Italy would work but for some unknown reason this is a bad purchase, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this DVD at all! i was looking forward to get it on the mail for such a long time, i was excited to put this movie on for my toddler boy, since i know Pinocchio sends a positive message to children, and that's why i feel so frustrated that this seller is knowingly putting this out for sale. Amazon needs to make arrangements with sellers like this one! too bad, i know i wont get my $ back and neither my son could watch his movie! DECEPTION !!!"
1,hate it,didnt watch this/returned it for a refund/ this was in italian notthe english copy i ordered./ i couldn't watch it / i'll re-order another movie so as i do like this movie
5,The Greatest Film To Be Made By Walt Disney (To Me At Least),"If I had to choose a favorite Disney movie to be made by Walt Disney himself, then that would definetly be ""Pinocchio."" The main reason is because of Pinocchio, himself. is cute, innocent, and much more delightful than the jerk in the book. Jiminy Cricket is also a fun sidekick character. He's charming, he sings softly, he definetly knows between right and wrong, and he is only crabby when something goes wrong. Figaro the cat is cute and bratty, such a delightful comic relief. The song ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" is soft and delightful. Also, the music video on this edition is one of the few Disney music videos I personally approve of. The only thing I pan about this movie is Stromboli and the Coachman. They both make the movie dark, and neither get punished. Luckily though, that's not the focus of the film. This is definetly one of Walt Disney's greatest films for a reason!"
5,A VERY SPECIAL RELEASE OF PINOCCHIO,IF YOU ARE A DISNEY FAN THIS EDITION IS A MUST OWN AND NOT VERY LIKELY TO BE REISSUED IN THIS SPECIAL STEELBOOK EDITION.THIS MOVIE WAS NOT SOLD IN STORES AND IS A VERY COLLECTABLE ADDITION FOR YOUR COLLECTION AND ALSO CONTAINS BOTH THE BLUE RAY RELEASE AS WELL AS THE DVD RELEASE.
5,Interview with the voice of Pinocchio,"Dickie Jones, who does the voice of Pinocchio, did a brief audio interview in 2009, discussing his participation in 1934's ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" and how he was given the role of Pinocchio.He also talks about his family and marriage of 59 years.To hear this interview and see a recent photo of Mr. Jones, please go to[..] and click on Interviews."
1,will return it,Will return it - did not realize it was not in English until Christmas morning when I tried to play it for my son and got message not compatible in this region?
1,Was Not Happy!!!,"It turned out to be a Region 2 DVD and would not play on my Blu-ray Player. I had looked at so many before I bought it I must have not looked, or it wasn't posted."
1,Very Dissapointed,I purchased this movie for my son(6yrs) and the add stated that the DVD was in excellant shape. We played it once and noticed some sound problems but when went to play this again the sound was horrible. I sent an email to Amazon and received no response. I would like to get a replacement but I do not know how to go about this as I no longer have any information on the person who actually sent it to me.For the most part I have had good luck buying from Amazon but this was a terrible purchase and we are very dissapointed.
3,Pinnochio DVD.. I purchased this for my little grandsons,"I purchased this for my little grandsons.. love the movie and the quality.........my main disappointment is the fact there is so much other stuff-new movie reviews before the movie starts it is a real pain..some are too scaryfor pre-schoolers and I have to FF to get it set for them to watch..Pinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition)why can't they just make """"THE MOVIE""""..isn't that what we are paying for and buying anyway??"
1,Pinocchio not the only one who lies!,This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
2,Not real,"well, this was not a real Disney copy of the movie. Plays fine. But for the price I expected a authentic Disney copy"
2,Not a good video for younger viewers,"While Pinocchio may be considered one of Disney's classics, some of the scenes/content in this older animation would not be shown or considered appropriate in today's children's movies. Gepetto is shown smoking in bed. Many of the characters smoke. Young boys are brought -- as a treat -- to a place where they can smoke, ""drink"" (something frothy like beer or root beer), and act very destructively as much as they want. The boys are tricked into thinking this is a fun place to go but are turned into donkeys and sold to work in mines -- never again to see their families. In the end, old Gepetto does get his wish. Pinocchio is a real boy. And old Gepetto gets to share his bed with the young boy. While all such scenes could be used for discussing appropriate behavior, I wouldn't recommend showing this movie to children. I made the mistake of showing this to my 4 and 2 yr olds. This is one those films I won't show over and over."
1,The Puppet Show,"This certainly is not one of my favorite Disney movies. I just really didn't get in to the movie I guess but then I never really cared for this Fairy Tale either.The voice actors are good and the scenery, and colors are great. But for some reason this one really just didn't hit home for me."
5,Help! Trying to find a seller for a Pinocchio DVD that works!,"I have been getting the run around all summer. If anyone can help me find a good seller for a Pinocchio DVD that works, I would appreciate it very much."
5,Pinocchio Review,Just as wonderful to watch now as it was when I was a little girl. Now my little girl gets to enjoy it! She loves it and has watched it many times. Beautifully done.
5,Pinocchio,Item being reviewedPinocchio (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition + Standard DVD+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]Great product and beautiful enhanced version of a Disney classic. DH
4,I Ordered This DVD For The Same Relative,"This is another movie that I ordered for the same relative. They don't own a computer, so they aren't able to order those good movies that you can't find in a video, or department store. I'm sure they are enjoying this movie. They would have let me known if there was a problem."
5,An actor's life for me,"""Pinocchio"" may be the best film that Disney gave us and this DVD version is as good as it can be. The drawings are magnificently detailed and the memorable music is excellent. No film collection should be without it."
5,A Classic!,"Beauty in the Beast is my favorite animated movie, but I think Pinocchio might be the best animated movie of all time. It's just perfect. Walt Disney's second animated feature lenth film after Snow White combines superb animation with a real soul of life. In a timeless story of a puppet coming of age, Pinocchio learns harsh lessons of temptation in a world of cruel characters, and eventually finds what's really most important. The richness of characters like Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's creator Gappetto, and a host of charismatic bad guys, just makes this film a special one.The DVD is a terrific restoration of picture and sound quality. It has a nice second disk of extra features, but the movie is what this is all about. A classic in every sense of the word."
1,Just for the Seller...,"I bought this ""new"" on amazon and when it was delivered I could tell it had been repackaged. Not only that but the plastic circle the holds the dvd into the case was broken for BOTH cds, and the dvd had scratches all over it. I wouldn't even consider this ""like new""Of course, the movie is still a wonderful classic."
2,Sent wrong item,"I've seen this movie, it's great, however the item I thought I purchased was NOT the item I received. I am still waiting for a refund or an exchange. (the movie I received is formatted for European DVD players, not USA)"
3,IIt would not play on our dvd palyer only on our computers,"I love the movie and it was fine on our computer. However, it would not play on any of our DVD players. Is there a problem that I can fix to allow it to play on both DVD players and computers?"
5,Adorable Wooden Boy,Walt Disney masterpiece at its best!!! This keeps you young at heart!!! Everyone should get a Walt Disney moivie collection from Amazon.
5,Pinocchio DVD Review,"I love this movie I think its great in fact I don't own the BD live I own the two disc DVD I love it and its got some great special features and the Picture and the Sound on the movie are superb! I highly Reccomend this movie, its a great story too, full of action and emotion!"
5,Pinocchio,Received the product quickly and it arrived in the condition as described. I have purchased from this seller one other time and will purchase from this seller again if the opportunity arises.
3,Mixed emotions.,"When I was a kid, I loved this movie so much I wore out two VHS copies of it, even though Monstro scared me silly. But watching it again now more than 15 years later, I have to wonder what I found so special about it. I can't really describe it, but I just feel so ""blah"" towards it now. Monstro is still pretty frightening, but that's the only part of the movie I like anymore. Maybe it is just me, but this movie is not as good as many of the others Disney has done."
1,NEVER AGAIN!!,"No where does it state that the DVD will not play in my region. I bought a DVD in America, it should work on my DVD player. The same with the bluray from MovieMars, it won't play because it's not available in my country. What in the world!!?"
1,NO Slipcover!!!,"I recently ordered the Pinocchio 2-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition blu-ray/dvd, and it did NOT come with a slip cover, just the basic blu-ray case. All the other Disney blu-ray's I ordered on Amazon came with nice metallic slip covers, EXCEPT this one. I'm almost 100% certain I have seen this item sold in stores with a slip cover. Why not here? I'm considering returning it, as I have not opened it yet."
