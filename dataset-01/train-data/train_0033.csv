5,They should teach this in middle school,"I loved this book! I got judged by a few narrow minded people bc of the title but the content is actually very intelligent and not what you might imagine. I've loaned it to my sisters and they loved it as well. Don't let the title give you the wrong impression. This book is not about teaching woman to snap their fingers and walk around with a chip on their shoulder. It's about teaching women to have self respect and to value themselves on all levels and how we have unhealthy relationship behaviors taught to us in movies, media, and handed down through the generations from our female role models. This book at no point says to be unkind or hurtful to anyone. Codependency seems to be common with females and it's a hard habit to break. As a mother of young girls I'm glad I can instill in them these principles and prevent them from developing the self defeating behaviors that I was taught."
1,"Stupid, Dumb Advice by Dumb, Stupid Author","This book gave no straight advice, was dumb, boring, and repetitive many times. I finished it in less than a day and then used the pages for toilet tissue when I was done."
1,Thrift Store Buy...,I am somewhat disappointed with this purchase. When I received the book there was a $2 sticker on the front of the book... There was also all of the quizzes and multiple things underlined with a Blue Color Crayon. I was a little put out for the fact that I paid $6 something vs. $2.
2,Not so pleased,Book arrived late and dirty. It was described as good by the vendor. That's why I'm giving it only 2 stars.
3,Lots of good advice,"I thought this book had a lot of good advice. I realized where I was going wrong in a lot of places. But, you also have to be yourself! Somebody who's meant for you won't care if you play these games or not, because they will love you for who you are. Still, some of the tricks may be helpful."
5,Sad but true,"This book was right on, much of what I read I kinda new and felt already, but it was valadating to see it in print.I also learned alot more.This book is a must read for woman who feel they give their all to a relationship only to be hurt and abandoned.This book gives much needed insight to the minds of men and what us woman can do to better understand them."
4,Smart and savvy,"I've been hearing a lot about this book, finally broke down and read it - and I wasn't disappointed. It's fun, funny, and smart with universal wisdom - it's no wonder it strikes a chord with women. Another book that is also highly enjoyable, smart and funny is ""Never Kiss a Frog: A Girl's Guide to Creatures from the Dating Swamp."" They both give savvy advice that is unique and filled with laughs. I recommend both of them as books to enjoy and share with girlfriends."
1,What the f%*?,"Why the author keep using the word ""Dumb Fox""? It's quite unnecessary. It ruins the whole structure of the book. She can easily say the smart girl. Yack ..."
3,I wish it was new!!!,"I'm satisfied with Amazon in general! However I was dissapointed in my last purchase! It supposed to be a new book, and I've got an underlined, marked and some pages even corner folded book.It would've been a hassle to send it back, so I just kept it the way it is! It would've been nice though if I wasn't charged for a new book!"
2,NOT THE GREATEST!,"No wonder there are so many unhappy men in America...that attitude from a woman did not fly with me. A friend of mine had it and I wanted to check it out. She is definitely a bitch in many ways, but not like in the book."
5,Awesome!!,"Very funny and enlightening!! Her advice is working for me and I love it! I definitely recommend this book, totally worth it!"
5,Excellent Information!,"Enlightening! Found out the things and ways of being that I've been doing right and the ways I could use a little help with. Overall, wonderfully insightful and very funny!"
5,Complete awesomeness!,A++++ This is a book that all women should have read years ago. It's the kind of book that you'll find yourself reading again and again and again!
5,Love It!,"I loved this book! It absolutely told me what I did wrong in my marriage for 7 years. I am now single and it has helped me stand up for myself and stop catering to everyone else. Not only am I more respected, I am more sought after as well. It's amazing. I feel better about myself and I'm not as worn out doing things for every one else. I reccommend this book to any woman not just for dating but for life in general.!!!"
2,I don't know if this really gets to the point,"I am a fast reader by nature, but this book took months to get through. Although she made some good points, I think it's pretty much what every other book out there says."
1,WOW!,"This book was manipulation and games to the max. I understand why guys think girls are so crazy sometimes, because of books likes this. Some of the things mentioned in this book were okay, but playing games catches up with you and then nobody is happy."
4,Interesting,"The question my girlfriends and I have been asking ourselves and each other for years!!! This book is an easy read, light and very understandable. Not sure I'd follow all the suggestions, but amusing and fun to read anyway."
2,"The title should be ""FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE OF DATING MEN""","If you are a woman who has no life outside of whatever man you are trying to pursue, then this is the book for you.This book pretty much tells women to pretend to have a life outside of your boyfriend or lover, only then will he realize how truly amazing you are.Only then will the man will try to pursue you and feel like he is winning you over, you alpha female you!Man's thoughts: ""Gosh, she has friends that she goes to the mall with on Saturdays and yoga in the evenings on weekdays, she's such a busy and important lady. She doesn't need a man in her life, that's why I like her.""For all women out there, I know finding the right person is tough.But please stop caring so much about having a relationship with a man.Find your own happiness within yourself.You don't need to read this book to tell you to go out and have a life!!!!!!"
1,A vain feeling of empowerment,"This book will give you a great sense of power like a dose of drugs, and then you'll crash and burn in the field. The world is already chock-full of b-itches and jerks, and most decent people avoid them as much as possible. It's rare you run into a kind, unselfish, communicative, mature woman these days. Try behaving like a decent human being first!"
5,Must read,"This book totally relates to my life ! A friend told me to read it and that was 3 years ago I've bought it and passed it around to other friends and we all have the same opinion, its great ! Women get the upper hand and check it out!"
5,Doormat no more,"I love this book and have bought it for several of my friends. Argov teaches you how to stop being a doormat and to take back your power. I love the writing style, it's upbeat and to the point. Very well done!Susan BarnesLove Magic"
2,This is what is wrong with women,"Men hate bitches. What Sherry fails to understand is that if a woman has to play the games she suggests in this book, perhaps she should be searching for a better man. I have spoken to women who have enjoyed this book and have taken the message to heart. These women have real problems finding a quality man and holding on to them. This book empower a woman's stupidity"
2,"Gee, I read this 6 mos. ago in ""Stop Getting Dumped!""","When I read this book I kept getting this deja-vu feeling like I'd read the book before - turns out I had. The whole dreamgirl idea was done much better (and seven or eight months earlier) by Lisa Daily in ""Stop Getting Dumped!"" which in my opinion is a much better read. The empowerment aspect of this book is good, and there are some humorous parts, but it just seemed to me like a less funny, far less interesting version of ""Stop Getting Dumped!"" which I totally loved. ""Why men love"", I'm not so crazy about. If you're a relationship book junkie, this is a reasonable pick to fill out your collection. If you're only buying one dating book this year, I wouldn't make it this one."
4,Good for Single Women,"I really liked this book but I think it would have been more helpful if I wasnt in a year long live in relationship. This seems better suited for a single woman starting a relationship or looking to have fun, there wasnt much advice for woman who are in long term relationships or woman who live with their spouse, but overall so far some of the techniques have worked."
2,A Man's Bad Experience from this book,"I had a girlfriend that I really liked. Then she started acting different, unavailable, and the sweetness I really liked in her changed to indifference.I saw this book in her house, and decided to read it myself.Advice to the ladies: If you think you're going to get anywhere with a man from playing games, you won't.Becaue I know how to be honest, I had a LONG talk with her about her sudden new behavior. She started to cry, and we were able to resolve it all, by really talking.This book does not teach a woman how to be real. It teaches you how to avoid pathetic men that treat women like trash.So if you want to have a great relationship, stop the games. If you are seeing a guy that treats you like trash, then move on."
3,A two and a half from me,"I probably wouldn't go out all the way to bash this book, but it doesn't mean I completely agree with everything the author says. If one follows her advice literally, it must be one hell of a tiring mental task you put yourself up with each day. This book might be suitable for the nearly- psychotic or the ultra-obsessive, but then if you are, get yourself proper treatment might be a better option.Her point of the entire book(as well as many other similar books) is: be strong. It is good. Be strong so in return men will stay and protect. Well it doesn't make sense, does it?"
3,Only Touch the Subject,"I felt I already knew the answer, but I wanted to hear what the author had to say. The book only brushes over the real reason. It's a great book for someone that is totally clueless as why men really love bitches. I felt the book could have gone in more detail. This book only lightly touches the subject. I would not pay more than $5.oo for the book. The title is amazing and catchy. Some may think it's male bashing, but it's not. A good book for the clueless beginner to shed some light why they cant' be a good girl."
5,Why Men Love Bitches,OK ladies...this book is AMAZING! You will see yourself in ever page...& learn ALOT about your man! It's the single BEST book I've ever read! Hurry up and buy it now!
1,Guide to complete dishonesty and cheating and lying yourself and everyone else,"This book is written unfortunatey by someone who has problems against the world.It teaches you how to cheat, lie to everyone, fake orgasms, forget who you are,and just be a complete bitch - and everyone will hate you for that.So if you want to ruin your life, do as it is written in this book..."
4,The real deal for nicegirls,There is such a thing as being too nice. This book is a good read for most women. I will definitely take it into consideration in my next relationship.
4,Love it,"This book, basically gives you an overview of everything a woman is already aware of, but is afraid to do. It's amazing how it definitely applies to real life, and she gives examples of both women in relationship and single. Great book!"
2,Started out good then went downhill...,"A friend suggested this book to me. She had read it and said that it was well written and had a comedic value to it so I downloaded the preview to my Kindle. After reading the preview, I purchased the entire book and sat down for an evening of what I thought would be a great read.The first 1/3 of the book is entertaining. It does have some good advice but was nothing that I hadn't already implemented or heard before. The enormous fault that I find with the book is toward the end, it starts to compare men to things like your dog and that you should treat them the same way. It turns condescending and I couldn't finish the last couple of chapters because of it. As the book says, there is a difference being a full blown irritating bitch and a bitch that a man loves. Unfortunately the author writes like the bitch a man loves in the beginning but turns toward the end."
5,Amazing Book!,"If you've ever had trouble finding OR keeping a man, read this book! If you heed the author's advice, he'll be massaging your feet and moping about the attention you are getting from other men within a week. No joke. Five solid stars!"
2,Why Men Love Ditzes,"I doubt any adult male with an IQ would buy into these cheesy games. Here was actual advice from the book:- Go in the basement and turn off the circuit breaker. Act afraid. When he turns it back on, celebrate him like a hero. (Page 143)- Make him feel powerful by having him address the hostess: ""Johnson, party of four."" (Page 87)- Fake an orgasm by panting like a dog and keep going even if he gets up and does something else. (Page 70)- Emulate those clever Japanese women who are degraded in public but collect their husband's entire paycheck in private. (Page 86)- Pretend you're too stupid to microwave popcorn. He'll take you out to dinner. (Page 7)This book was good for a few laughs, hence the two stars. If you're looking for actual relationship advice, any of the Dummies or Idiot's guides would represent an improvement. The people who write them are qualified to do so."
1,Huh?,"Let me get this striaght. If a woman is acting like a total bitch toward me, that means she LIKES me? My mind is officially blown.I'll bet women who take this book seriously are perfect for guys who take ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss seriously. I just hope I'm not the only single person left in this world who just wants to have a nice relationship with a nice person and not have play a bunch of silly mind games."
5,EXCELLENT READ!!!,"This book is excellent and has changed my outlook on relationships. It is easy to read, humorous and includes real life examples. I found out about this book through a friend and finished it in two days. I haven't been in many relationships and I often wondered why mine ended diasterously when I thought I was being a good woman to my man and doing all the right things. This book was an eye opener for me. We've all heard of ""the rules"", but Sherry Argrove is right on point in her book when she says it's not playing games, it's about taking control of your life and not allowing a man to have a 100 percent hold on you. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ANY NICE GIRL THAT IS TIRED OF BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED!!!!!"
4,Good information,Lots of good advice. Wish I would have read it before I got my heart broken. Girls should have to read this in junior high to learn how to handle men better and not be a doormat.
4,Highly recommend,"The title may seem kitschy, but don't be fooled -lots of intelligent advice in this book that extend far beyond just what men like (or don't)."
5,Incredible advice!,"The advice given in this book is incredible. It starts off on what you should do when you meet/date guys, but as you get deeper into the book, it's really about how to have dignity and having your OWN life..and most importantly, that you are first, he is second. Incredible advice. Every woman must read this.."
4,I Recommend this to Women Who are Doormats,"I bought this book just for the title b/c it reflects exactly what I always believed, men do love bitches. Except I learned that I was the wrong type of bitch. I was the ""Joan Collins, Dynasty"" bitch instead of the ""Sweet Georgia Peach Bitch."" I would like to thank the author for making the right bitch, I was way off. LOL"
5,"The title is misleading, excellent book.","The author is not suggesting that you be a ""bitch"". What she is saying is that you should not drop everything every time a man comes into your life..as so many women do. Don't stop working out because your boyfriend wants to meet during your regular gym class time. Don't cancel a date with your friends because he wants to go out. Men like women who have an opinion and their own lives. If you hate this book it's because you didn't read it or you didn't get it."
1,Get what you deserve,"Nice girls always finish last, huh? Well, yes, if you believe this book's premise. Such rancor is childish nonsense. A bitch deserves, gets, and ends up with a dog...if that. Hell hath no fury...Better to just stick to getting money and call it ""love myself"", thank you, and ""fxxx yourself"", loser, this book's making me loads of money telling hurt women how to get back at men. Try it, and you'll see what you ""get back"" alright. Another way may be to be a better person and learn how to attract and select better types of people and remain wary of badmouthing ( ""All men are..."") n envious friends around you keeping you down by the fire hydrant...with ""ad-vice"" and books like this. Otherwise, good riddance and begone with you because you'd just prove that it then wasn't such a mistake to breakup with you after all..."
4,:),This book is great teaches you how much worth you are compared to anybody else and makes you reavaliate your relationships with friends and boyfriends...value yourself and everyone else will follow your actions and react accordingly
2,Games,"This book only tells you how to play games, if you wanna play games, go ahead. If you're looking for something real, then save your money."
1,They Don't.,"Men do not love bitches. If they are with one, then they either gave up on love, lack courage to stand up for themselves, or do not know that real love exists out there for them. Men and women are from the same species and essentially have the same standards for each other. They both do not like being treated poorly by the other. They both do not respect promiscuity in the opposite sex (men call women whores and women call men dogs). And they both want mutual love and respect. So be nice, loving, and respectful to each other and be happy. What is so complicated?"
3,Proceed...with caution.,"I definitely feel that this book has a great overall message and something dor each woman to learn/take from it. However, I think some of what she says about how guys think may only be true of the guys she knows or share alot of her same demographics. Still, the message is clear and valid."
4,very good,I bought why men love bitches along with her other book why do men marry bitches and I purchasedDatingDating by Gloria JeanAll 3 of these books were great. why men love bitches was a very fun read.
5,A very comprehensive history from the very begining.,"This is the most informative book about Amway that there is. It covers Rich and Jay's beginings and how their visions transformed into an opportunity that can enable the common person to realize their dreams. There are many rare pictures and illustrations that aren't printed anywhere else. If you are a distributor, this should be required reading, it's good to know Amway's remarkable history. It will instill a sense of pride when the going gets tough, as it occasionally does."
1,Edited for Television,Very disappointed in this tape. This tape contains a copy of the movie that was apparently edited for television. I say that becuase I noticed that there were several scenes cut from the movie. The movie on this tape doesn't flow correctly and there are references in the movie to scenes that the viewer never sees.I wouldn't recommend the purchase of this tape.
3,So so,"I watched it and then gave it away. The comedy and slap stick got redundant. I am a Red Skelton fan, it is just that the story line fell flat."
4,One of my very favorite CD's,"When I find myself getting stressed, or if I want to re-set my mood on the way to or from work, I often pop Solitude in my CD player. While many other CD's appeal to me aurally, Solitude is unique in its ability to conjure images of far ranging places in my mind. The first track ""Breath"" really lifts me up with its unique energy and spirit. Solitude is also unique in its ability to create calm peaceful moments.I would highly recommend this album by Fernando James to anyone who is looking for a unique and original talent to calm the savage beast within."
4,great,love this box set but the only thing is that it comes in two boxes i rather have it in one box.the episodes areDISC 1surprisechase's girlfriendhot deanzoey's tutorthe greatvince blakeDISC 2silver hammersocietymichael loves lisawrestlingzoey'a balloonchase's grandmaDISC 3quarantinethe radiopaige at pcadance contestthe favor chainDISC 4zoey's ribthe curse of pcadrippin'son of a deanDISC FIVEhands on a blix vanmiss pcalogan gets cut offgoodbye zoey?great dvd set
2,missing box?,"I ordered this Zoey 1010 complete season 3 set. the write up says it comes with 5 discs. But there are only 3 discs in the box. I see the review states it should come in TWO boxes, and maybe I am missing a box? I returned the box, and now re-ordered , hoping to get BOTH boxes for this complete season 3 set. Wish me luck!"
3,Zoey 101,why is the first season only 10 bucks and the other seasons are 30. I already have the first season. I love zoey 101 im starting watching them alot on teennick now. I said i wanna see how much they are on amazon.
4,"Great phone, not-so-great ringtones","Upgraded from the Nokia 3650 because I wanted a camera phone. Picture quality is decent enough considering it's a phone. Reception is great, all the time. I've had this phone for two months and have dropped only one call, early on. The interface is very easy to understand.My only complaint is in regards to the ringtones. The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs. What's worse, you can't record your own and use them, as with many other phones. You have to go to Cingular's site and shell out $2.50 apiece for twenty-second (or less) audio clips."
1,Horrible,"I take great care of my phone, yet this phone has a camaera that no longer takes pictures, it constantly drops calls (for whatever reason), it has horrible ringtones (unless you like really bad elevator music or the sound of very light bells). It's slow to respond to dialing too.I have had this phone for one year."
3,LG L1200 - bad reception,"I ordered this phone on the net for free with the 2 year Nationwide 450 rollover min Cingular plan. The phone is very well designed, pleasant to manage and small. Also, it is very, very easy to operate. The only thing that I find negative is its reception. I can hardly hear the person at the end of the line. If you use Cingular, you have 30 days to exchange it."
1,Frozen in Time,I didn't have this phone for 2 weeks when it failed on me twice within 72 hrs! I'm so disappointed as it's a sharp-looking phone with nice features and good sound clarity. But the display froze and could only be restored to service by removingthe battery. I returned it to Cingular as I can't deal with such unreliable performance.
1,can not hear a thing,this phone has great features only if you are not interested in hearing who you are talking to and don't want them to hear you clearly. the volume goes up to a level 5 and i need at least 2 more volume levels to hear most people. i'm 25 and not hard of hearing so you can see how this would be a problem. when i'm on the phone i have this weird look on my face b/c i'm trying to decipher what people are saying to me. do not get this phone unless you also want to purchase a whisper 2000 to go along with it.
1,No Kathy Smith,When I ordered this tape it was build as Kathy Smith. I even returned the tape twice. Thinking I would get the Kathy Smith tape. I ended up giving up and keeping this tape. I don't care for it. There are better tapes out there
2,Left leaning book,"This book is very one sided and very liberal. I have no problem with political philosophies different than my own. The problem I do have is being forced to spend $80.00 on a book that blames the ""white man"" for every ill of modern history. This view of history needs to be told. I just wish other viewpoints were told as well. Having said that, it is written well and gives the reader a different view of history."
2,A bastion of liberal propaganda,"I'm a high school junior in NJ, and I have to say that I have never met a single balanced history textbook throughout my education. ""From the back cover: Emphasizing social history, especially as it applies to discussions of race, class, and gender..."" And you wonder why all teenagers nowadays are all liberal Bush-haters, when they've been brainwashed by such biased history. Oh, conservatives are bad, right-wings are evil, this book preaches. And let's spend 10 chapters on Native Americans, 10 chapters on women, 10 chapters on slaves. Unbelievable."
1,very left wing bias,"dont waste your time with this guy. I don't know where he gets his info. My son has one of Mr. Nash's textbooks for history and I have never seen so much left wing bias, especially in a textbook."
1,Shows how some careers start very humbly indeed ..............,"Gross. The faultiest cd I've ever owned. Ten seconds of the end of each track begins the next track. No idea how or why, and no interest. Ordinary music, appalling artwork. An early Dan Siegel effort, best forgotten."
4,A Great Buy,"The Essential Books are a great way to catch up on the history of your favorite marvel comics. This one covers the early days of the X-Men, and while [like many of the comics I've read from this era] are just self-contained stories in each issue with few plot elements that carry over (There are a few, just not as many as you see now), it is still a good read. You see the first appearances of many of the X-Men mainstays (Magneto, The Sentinels), and it is amusing to see how much has changed since the beginning.I eagerly await the Essential books that cover the rest of the early X-men issues."
3,X-Men Issues 1-24,"The Sept 1, 1963 X-Men #1 starts this book off and goes through issue #24. Featuring Angel, Iceman, Marvel Girl, Cyclops, and a very human looking Beast."
4,I loved it :3 !!!,It was a great purchase will difinately buy other comics from you! However it does take forever to come in the post :3!!
5,"Burney, Austen's Inspiration","I enjoy all the works of Fanny B, especially ""Evelina"" and again ""Camilla."" I think the BBC should do period dramas of these works."
5,Loved every minute of it.,"I just finished reading Camilla. I'm very sad it is over. I am not an avid reader, but Camilla has made me one. If I can read a 900 page book, I can read anything. But I don't know if anything will be as good. I am a big fan of the Austen movies. I finally read Pride and Prejudice. I was a little disappointed that it was slow moving. I found Camilla the opposite. I just ordered Evelina and Cecilia. I can't wait."
3,"An interesting idea, but could have been a better book","MacDonald Reid's Jihad: World War in 2036, in an excellent narrative. Unfortunately, while the idea is there, the book suffers from lack of a compelling story. Putting aside, the lack of differences as to how the military would actully function in 2036, the book, instead of being a story, simply descibes all of the events. You can never relate to any of the characters, good or bad, and they all seem cartoonish (with every other line ending in an exclaimation mark). The book's saving grace is that the author obviously shows that he knows the subject area, and put considerably thought as to how things might be different 40 years from now (though, I think he should have gone allot farther). I just wish that he took this interesting concept and applied it to the characters."
3,"Good Book, but too expensive",I finished reading this book and found it to be very entertaining. The story flows well and it is obvious the author knows her tactics and military terminolgy. The story is engrossing and kept my interest. The biggest turn off is the price. The book is not a hardcover yet it is very expensive. It is way too pricey for a soft cover.
3,adventures with attitude,"While I agree that the adventures that Michael Crichton has written about in this book are sometimes pretty interesting, I found by the end of the book that I was disgusted with him and really ended up not liking him at all. It is impossible to write about personal travels without your true personality coming through in your writing- and his came across as arrogant and self righteous. He seemed to think that people should treat him a certain way because of who he was (or what he had-which obviously was plenty of money and free time). I pictured him as some sort of grown-up, spoiled rich kid who has not an ounce of humble in him. He's obviously a successful writer- but for travel adventure reading--stick with Paul Cahill, Bill Bryson and David Quammen--all guys who go to wild places, have cool experiences, get along with the locals and are funny. Those three seem like really good guys that you could actually have a great time travelling with."
4,Good but not great,"I am a great fan of Michael Crichton. I enjoyed the parts in this book about his travels around the world and about quitting medicine. But, the parts about ""inner travel"" I did not care for so much. A lot of it is true however, such as our mind causing some of our medical problems, etc."
5,Great,I loved this book. Absolutely stunning story telling of his life. The best book ever written besides the Bible.
5,Great life story,This autobio is great. He tells of his extraordinary life and adventures. My favorite book.
4,insightful,"I'm not going to rehash what has already been said. I just want to say that I thought he was a little hard on Richard Feynman (Nobel prize-winning physicist). When he says that Feynman had not interest in philosophy or art I felt he was off base. If you read about Feynman you will get his view on life even if it is not presented as a philsophy per se. As for the lack of interest in art, the man drummed to ballet. Not my cup of tea, but it is art."
4,Interesting and informative,"I found ""Travels"" to be an excellent page turner. Michael Crichton has accomplished quite a few feats in his life, and shares a few with us in this book. I did not care much for the ""supernatural"" sections he has written about, but that is just my opinion. All in all, if you are a Crichton fan, or a fan of traveling throughout the world, I highly recommend reading this book."
3,intelligently bizarre,"I find Michael Crichton's books extremely fascinating because they are some of the very few massmarket books written for intelligent people. This book is a different twist from his usual works, it in many ways reminds me of Eric Segal-- must be the Harvard Med connection. It opened my eyes to a ""new age"" way of looking at things--he has written the first book I have ever read on the subject without a ""fruitcakey"" approach to it."
4,A Good Read,"Good autobiography by an interesting writer and person. The beginning when he's in med school is interesting by not great and the end when he goes on about paranormal stuff isn't top notch but still interesting. Overall, i recommend the book and it's worth a read by anyone who likes Crichton's stuff."
5,Wonderful!,"Michael Crichton has written an honest, disturbing, and insightful portrait of himself. This is one of the best Crichton books I've read. It is entertaining, silly, funny, dramatic and odd. Even a non-fan of Crichton should like this book."
3,It has its highs and lows,"I like the idea of searching for meaning in one's life. I am impressed by the number of remote, obscure locales that Crichton visited. I am intrigued - if not entirely convinced - by Crichton's experiments with the paranormal. So I found ""Travels"" interesting, if not what I expected. Crichton has a nice way of putting a mostly humorous, ironic spin on his tales while considering their roles in his life. But I think he tried to accomplish too much with ""Travels"" - in the end it feels as though it is stretched rather thin in places and really accomplished nothing."
1,So-so observations - could have been so much better.,"This book was rather disappointing. Crichton comes across as pompous. As I read it I felt insulted that he needed to overexplain every insight to his readers. He went on some interesting trips, but I couldn't help thinking someone else would have described the experiences much better."
1,a confused mind trying to find peace,"I was amazed that in this day and age, a well known author can describe an African woman as an ""animal"" and SouthEast Asian child as a ""mongrel"". Mind boggling !...The author includes a story to a southeastern brothel where children are the prostitutes. As a reader you are shocked at him and his friends, actually checking out the kids in room after room. Somehow Crichton decides it is not for him and opts out.I am thinking, Did you really have to go into the brothel where children are prostituted to find that one out?Sick....Washington Post calls this crap ""entertaining""! They must have been thinking about the dinosaur book."
3,Too Much Michael Crichton,"Sorry to disagree with everyone so far, but I regretted how much of a glimpse into his personality Crichton gave me with this book. He comes across as insufferable and arrogant; a person with whom I certainly would not enjoy travelling. He has visited some interesting places, but his ego was paramount to most of them. There are other books about personal experiences with travel that have much less ""I"" in them (including ""Into Thin Air,"" which certainly is personal, but is not egocentric), and are more enjoyable because of it. The beauty of a good selection of travel essays is that one can imagine oneself participating in the experience. Not ""Travels."" Crichton is omnipresent.That being said, I enjoyed reading about climbing Kilimanjaro for the realistic descriptions of the experience. Still, I would have preferred to climb it without Crichton, who should stick with gripping, well-researched fiction."
5,Great Book,"Personal thoughts on a number of really cool travel experiences. Gives a clue as to where he got some of his ideas/inspirations.Made me hate him less for being a Harvard Grad....but had to laugh about him wearing 'new' boots on Kilimanjaro...Cambridge didn't prepare him for much, and this book explains his thoughts around that as well."
3,More than I need to know...,"I started this book on Saturday night and finished it by Sunday morning. It's well written and interesting to a certain extent. The intent of the book doesn't appear to be in any way related to external/physical travel, but rather Michael's own intellectual (and certainly emotional) travels. Not bad content if you like that sort of aimless (self-serving?) prattle. I'm still not sure what the point of the book is. He's put the Asian, European, Caribbean, etc. travels into the book as a kind of garnish...the main course is his own emotional and intellectual wanderings.I much prefer Jurassic Crichton."
1,What a surprise,"I am truly surprised so many people loved this book. I bought it as soon as I saw it because I was a huge Michael Crichton fan. Big mistake. He shows himself as selfish, whiny, immature, and self-absorbed. I will have a hard time reading another one of his books with such a horrible image of him."
2,Downer!!!,It took me 1 month to finish reading this book. It was a disappointment compared to his other novels. It's a waste of money and time.
2,Disappointed and Disgusted,"A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.In the end I was very disappointed. Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude. He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter. How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. I have no desire to read any more of his books."
1,A waste of paper,"The book starts off strong with interesting accounts of his medical school experiences, but after a while, the story becomes more of a sales pitch for meditation and other new age mumbo jumbo. By the end, Crichton looks like a total kook rather than the ""Harvard trained physcian"" that he uses to advertise himself. If you really want to read about ""Travels,"" pick up a copy of Tony Horwitz, Bill Bryson, or writers who actually know how tell a story."
1,Travels,"We were very disappointed as the book arrived very wet. It was December during the time that we had a month of heavy rain. It was packaged in a paper envelope and it was soaked when we opened the packaging so when it finally dried after several days, it was in terrible shape. The pages were wrinkly, some of the ink ran and it had a smell to it! And it was a Christmas gift so it was very disappointing!A suggestion would be that in the winter when weather conditions are wet that the book be put into a plastic bag before wrapped in the paper packaging."
1,boo hoo,"The book had gotten me very interested to keep reading, but I did not like the eanding or who was doing the murdering. It should have been a little more interesting as far as the characters."
2,Couldn't finish- not up to level of some of my favorite Bentley Little- Like the Store.,"Couldn't really finish this book, real weird, sort of cop/ alcoholic single parent novel, more than horror. sort of seemed like a bad episode of Dexter... Kind of violent towards the main boy to, which was not pleasant. Surprised this has such a good rating, not up their with The Store, or even THe Resort from BL. WOuldn't recommend."
4,A prominent member of a gang meets Jesus...,"In 1995 I fell in love with a strongly believing girl and she gave me several books to read. ""Run, Baby, Run"" was one of them (it was written in Czech) and one should admit that I enjoyed the book. Nicky Cruz's gang was really very violent, fighting with policemen often and many people there were drug addicts. But a preacher introduced Nicky to Jesus Christ one day and then everything changed..."
5,Kids Love this Book,"When I was a middle school teacher in the 80s and 90s (I left teaching for another occupation), I used to read this text to my students the last 10 minutes of class (with my school principal's permission). My students were riveted to Nicky's story and begged each day for more time with the reading. Nicky's message is a powerful and positive one. I believe this story is still very relevant today. Some of the religion, although vital to the story, may need to be toned down for public school classrooms. I would edit the reading during the read-alouds but even doing this, the story remained compelling and transformative. I highly recommend the book and am pleased to see that its appearance has been updated and that Nicky Cruz's message continues to inspire young people today."
4,Great Christian Read,Should be required reading for every Christian. Tells the story of a gang member whose life is turned around.
4,A true inspiration...,"This book is a great read!With simple language that helps you get closer to the characters, and the inpiring goals that make you reflect in your own life!Truely one of the few books that could change your life for ever :)"
5,It was a truly inspirational book for teenagers,I learned how rough the gang life was and I was really inspired at how Nicky converted to Christ after being such a feared gangster.
5,very strong message,"I read this book at a relatively young age (14? 15?) and was strongly impacted by it. I wasn't in any danger of being sucked into drugs or the like, but it really gave me an insight into the lives of kids who are! What a great story."
4,"Run, Baby, Run",This is an amazing testimony. It is very graphic so I wouldn't recommend it for younger children. But it is an absolutely amazing book.
5,Exciting and Real,"I couldn't put the book down. Nicky's depiction of his journey from darkness to light was riveting. If his story doesn't touch you and you don't feel God's Spirit while reading it, then you need to pray and ask God to open the eyes of your understanding and to speak to you.For me, this was not merely abook purchase for me from Amazon,truly it was a good investment spiritually and I believe it will be for you as well."
3,"not bad, but there are better bios of bach","This is not a bad introduction to the life and music of J.S. Bach, however it is nowhere as well written or informative as Christoph Wolff's biography. I found myself falling to sleep reading Boyd, but the Wolff kept me interested all the way. Wolff also presents the death of Bach's parents as a much more central experience, which I found Boyd tended to place less significance on. This is not a poor book, it is just that the Wolff bio is so much better."
5,A Fair Read...,"Malcolm Boyd's Bach is nearly a classic at this point. It's a fair read, but frankly it leaves me a little flat. It's okay, but truth be told, Karl Geiringer's Bach is far, far better."
1,Like Watching Stone Crumble,"I was really looking forward to the continuation of Ayla's story, but this was more like a broken record repeat of it. This is the most repetitive book I've ever encountered. It made me wonder if the author was to be paid by the word! Really, it was sad - and annoying - how much of the book was wasted on retelling the previous 4 books. Then there were the constant repetitions of Ayla's ""formal greetings"" and the overly detailed and rather crudely written sex scenes that had me thinking it might be more fun to go sandpaper my brain. The story didn't progress much for all the hours it took to listen to it. I don't recommend it unless you just want to hear a voice going on and on and on about nothing much at all."
2,A Disappointment,"I'm going to make this short and sweet. What a disappointment. I also waited with much anticipation for this book and was so upset I almost but a match to it. The ending left me wanting to throw it out the window. I loved all the previous books but like other reviewers I found myself skipping page after page searching for some ""action"". I'm hoping the next one will be better. Usually I buy the hard copy. I may wait and get it from the library."
2,Nothing new or notable happens.,"I loved all four of the first books in this series and couldn't wait for this one. However, it is very much a repeat of everything that happened in the preceding four books in the series about the cro-Magnon woman--Ayla continually dazzles Jondalar's family with her ability to start fires with flint, domesticate wild animals, hunt better than the men in the tribe, etc. in the hopes that her amazing abilities will help them accept her as one of them. With nothing new to add to the series, this one was not worth the time it took to finish reading."
2,Keeps going downhill,"I have read every book in the series, and despite the fact I was not thrilled with the 4th book, I was excited to see the 5th one had come out. Unfortunately, as far as the series go, I feel the first one was wonderful, the second ok, the third excellent, and the fourth and fifth nothing to write home about. Auel needs to get herself a good editor to tighten up her work. There is a good novel in here somewhere, she just needs some help to find it. She also needs to remember that what made the first book so special is that Ayla was human. She's become such a superwoman I sometimes just find myself shaking my head.I'll read the 6th one when it comes out, it is as if I can't help myself. But here's to hoping Auel recovers the magic she seems to have lost."
2,Very disappointing,"If ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" was as mediocre as this book, its likely that the series would have ended right there. ""Clan"" was an excellent book -- and the others in the series were also very good -- but this book is very lacking in drama and repetitious to the point of boredom. The detailed research, which was skillfully woven into the story in earlier books and gave life and dimension to the characters and events, appeared in this book as lengthy descriptions which interrupted the story. As an Auel fan, I've eagerly read all of the previous books in this series, and was hoping that the negative reviews on ""Shelters"" were exaggerated. Sad to say, they're not. The only positive thing about this book is that Auel fans will have a chance to re-enter Ayla's world again after a long wait. I'm hoping that the next book will be better..."
1,When will it be over?,"What a disappointment! Be prepared to skip not just pages but whole chapters! In fact, do yourself a favor and skip the whole thing!! This entire book can be read in minutes, I brought it on a plane trip and was so cheesed off that I wasted the valuable space in my carry on. I mean, nothing ever happens in this entire book--its boring--all character development has been arrested--why does the reader have to be subjected to every inane, sophmoric thought that goes through these characters minds? Why was this book even printed? Did Jean Auel get tired of her characters? Geez-o-man, I hope these reviews save at least one person from being bored beyond belief. Whatever happens, Don't buy this book!!!!!"
2,What happened?,"I don't know what happened, but his book was a sore disappointment. I waited excitedly for this book to come out. When I was done all I could say was that I would not recommend it to others. The story was weak. She described everything to death and forgot to tell a good story."
1,A long-awaited disappointment...,"Having been a faithful reader of the first 4 books, Shelters of Stone was eagerly anticipated for 11+ years. What a let-down! It is if someone else wrote this book. The repetition of descriptions of places or encounters that the characters have is annoying, to say the least. Jean Auel never wrote like this in the first 4 books. Ayla can rethink a thought or conversation for two or three pages. It is if the ""author"" is trying way too hard to educate the reader or make the situations in the book more true through repetition. Or the publisher, like a teacher, said this had to be so many pages long and the writer went back and repeated and rehashed each scene in the book. One of the most irritating books I've read in a long time. If you liked the first 4 books of the Earth Children series I would NOT recommend this book. It is a great disappointment."
1,Stone cold cash shelter.....,"Sorry Jean, but like many other Ayla fans, I have absolutely longed for this book, and now I wish I had waited for the paperback.When ""Plains of Passage"" ended, Ayla & Jondalar have journeyed through an array of fascinating adventures, and have at last arrived at Jondalar's home cave, pregnant, ready to be mated. ""Shelters..."" tells the story of their next 8 months, a tale that would have taken a couple of chapters in any of the preceding books, in an agonizing 749 pages...I skimmed and skimmed looking for a spark of Ms. Auel's altogether absent inventiveness and storytelling skill. No pathos, no finely drawn protagonist, no interesting new adversary. If she had wanted to add another few pages, perhaps Ms. Auel could have quoted her Song of the Mother ONE MORE TIME? I'm disappointed that JA would cheat her fans....I gladly paid for the book, but the story I expected was missing."
2,Where's the plot?,"I cannot believe, after 12 years of ""research"", this is the best Ms. Auel can come up with. The tediousness of the cave life (yes, yes, you wake up and pass your water, but do I need to read about it several times throughout the book?), the ad nauseum introductions, the one-dimensional characters...I was beyond frustrated! I think ice age cave life was well covered in her previous books and was looking forward to seeing the story advance and bring closure to many of the visions and dreams Ayla has had throughout the previous books. Even now, Ms. Auel has let 5 years elapse since this was released and I can't help but wonder if we will ever see the dramatic conclusion alluded to in previous books. She doesn't need more research, she needs to finish!"
2,The weakest of the 5 books.,"Finally, I finished the book. This book is too long, with too little content. You feel you are reading the same paragraphs over and over until you have it memorized verbatim. There isn't an engaging story. Basically it's about Ayla getting introduced to Jondalar's people and travelling to the Summer Camp (similar to the story in The Mammoth Hunters) and having her baby. I was waiting for something interesting to happen in the book, but it never materialized."
2,The Shelters of Stone,"Was disappointed in the book. Too much repetition. Wasn't it Hemingway who advised not to use a paragraph when a sentence would do? And, to use short sentences. Had Ms Auel followed his advice the book would have been half as long and, maybe, a much better read. I found her last four books better than this one. Hopefully the next(last?) one will be better."
1,Did anyone else notice these few things?,"Why didn't Ayla react to the revelation that Jondalar's Elan(clan?) is the tail of an ermine and that he has always liked the white tails with the little black tips? It just happens to be the very same thing that she used to decorate the white tunic she made for him. Remember when she was floored that she was going to be adopted into the Lion Hearth of the Lion Camp? Also that Jondalar has also been choosen by the Cave Lion, and has scars like her too?Speaking of the Cave Lion, Ayla appears to have forgotten him in this book, she hardly ever ""prays"" to it anymore.And why does Jondalar now get very upset around a dead body?He wasen't so neverous around Rydag or the two Sungaea children or Jetamio or Attaroa.Mabey Jean was so busy re-re-re-writing the Mother's Song that she didn't notice there few laps of the plot."
2,"Action, please!","After reading the first 700 pages, I gave up any hopes of encountering a plot. Simply nothing of consequence happens in this book. Ayla encountered a few people who grumbled about her association with the clan, but these were easily dismissed by the rest of the people of her cave. If anything, Ayla was too easily accepted, leaving her no challenges to overcome. Even the detailing of stone-age life, which was a favourite aspect of the previous books, was lacking here. So, for most of the book, we just get passages from a terrible poem interspersed with Jondalar's proclamations of love."
1,Shelters of Stone,I was very disappointed in this last installment. 2/3 of the book seemed to span a total of 2 months and then in the last 2 chapters we rushed through 6 months of time. The character development was very poor and the humanity of the characters was missing. I would have rather spent my time re-reading Clan of the Cave Bear. It would have been a better story.
2,real snoozer,"OK--here's the entire plot: Ayla helps a little, hunts a little, humps a little, takes care of her animals, gets married and has a baby. Problem is--anyone who has read Auel's previous books already knew that--that was the plan at the end of the last book! I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, but nothing ever did. There were no surprises, very little conflict, no further character development of Ayla and Jondalar, and no character development at all of anybody else. Tons of named, but useless, characters cluttered the novel. It also seemed there were the starts of some interesting plots, all which deadended.Yes, obviously well researched since we had long explanations of minute details of stuff was made, etc. But I think at this point Ms. Auel has made it abundantly clear that she'd rather do research than write good fiction."
3,Kindle Version full of Errors,"I have loved the Earth Children series and have the 4 previous books in hard cover. For many reasons, I haven't been able to read much over the past several years. My son gave me a Kindle for Christmas, so I downloaded the Kindle version of Shelters of Stone. How disappointing it is to [try] to read this version; there are so many errors that it is distracting. Further, the errors are repeated over and over throughout the text... like anders for antlers. They seem to be scanner OCR errors because you can 'see' how the word was confused. Too bad someone didn't proof read this. If I had known how badly the Kindle text was, I would have paid more for the hard cover and NOT read it on my wonderful Kindle."
2,Too long and repetitive,"I bought this book because I enjoyed all the others, to varying degrees (though I don't really remember the fourth one at all). And I have to admit this one has a not put downable quality to it in that you want to know what happens! But nothing much does and there are so many repetitive passages that it made me wonder whether the book was edited at all. I think the Zelandoni attitude towards ""Pleasures"" is refreshing but I don't think the sex scenes between Jondalar and Ayla add anything to the story."
2,Bought out of the children's section..........has now been placed in the adult section...,"As a grandmother preparing for a spring break with my grandchildren, I purchased this audio book so they would have something to keep them busy on a long ride of over 9hrs, when we were playing it it came to a part that I thought would be a little kissing however it became X rated for children....not knowing the author or reading any of Jean M Auel books before... this is not for the ears of children 6yrs to 12yrs of age....I on the other hand when my grandchildren went back home I finished the book...all but the sexual parts that go into real detail...would be great for kids.... its to bad that this book goes into that much detail this book as is should not be recommended for children as it was when I looked children books. I bought this out of the Children section.....and it has now been removed out of the Children's Section recommendation......."
1,How to be bored out of your skull.,"I fell asleep twice. This book should be used as a teaching aid on what NOT to write. There is absolute NOTHING happening. In my book, ""Alien Ice,"" I have more action in one paragraph than there is in this whole 15 hours of listening. I quit listening after 4 tapes because I kept falling asleep. Shame on Brilliance for publishing this book on tape, especially since it is unabridged."
2,Why did she bother?,"I was a great fan of the Authors previous books. I found all of them imaginative and the detail very interesting. I have to admit that The Plains of Passage became a little tedious at times, but the story line made it worth the while.In this installment however, the detail was tediously boring. I found myself skipping pages to try and get back to the story. But the story was merely a recounting of the previously explained history of Ayla and her skills. The characters are even so similar to previous books characters that the encounters are repetetive. The story that this book tells is almost non- existent. The characters are one dimensional. It could have been told better in two hundred pages.In other words, it was a big disappointment, a well written yawn."
1,The long road to no where,"Like so many other fans of the Earth's Children series, I was disappointed in this installment. In my opinion, the book was about 500 pages too long. Too many words!! Get to the point Jean Auell. Where was the character development? Where was the story of the people? The dialog was totally unbelievable. In short it was an effort to finish the book, I only did so because I am an optimist, I kept hoping it would get better. Will I read the next book? If it takes another 10 yrs. to get out I probably won't."
1,How Disappointing,"I waited twelve years for this book, and I would have been less disappointed if it had not been written at all. It is entirely too lengthy and uses too many words to say too little. The description of how the ""spear thrower"" works is one example. What took half an hour to read could have been summed up in one page. The use of contemporary English does not fit the characters at all. I think I'll pass on the next book in the series where Ayla visits the Pacific. What a disappointment."
3,disappointed,"Auel continues to fascinate with her research and speculations about the life of pre-historic man, however, she missed her opportunity with this book. Amazingly, Ayla is only 19 at the END of this book?! She should have aged Ayla, which would have had its own interesting possibilities, and made this book about her children. Fans of this series waited a long time and there is little progression in the story to show for it."
3,Kinda Boring,"I rushed into the store to pay the 20 dollars for this book thinking that it would live up to the excitement of the others. i began thinking that maybe i was less exciting 10 years ago and didn't know any better. But i really have to believe that the writing of the previous 4 books in the series did not have such predictable sex scenes and ""caveman"" language. The dialogue is so staccato as to be baby like. very annoying."
3,Boooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnngggggg,"Okay, I too waited 10 years for this thing! The book was just very boring. The characters were boring, there was really no plot except for maybe Ayla being pregnant, which of course lasts the entire book. There was no tension; nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat. In ten to twenty years whent the last book in the series comes out, I think I'll wait for it in paperback."
3,only average!,"After enthusiastically starting this long-awaited sequel to the original 4 books, I have to confess I was pretty bored by about chapter 4. Like other reviewers here, I eventually started skimming the long descriptive passages and repetitive introductions. In fairness, I did enjoy the parts where there was some action(!) and was actually sorry when the book finally ended, as it is obviously set up for a sequel, in order to resolve many unfinished issues.This book is definitely only for the fans."
2,"Disappointing, to say the least.................","After waiting 12 years or more for this book I was very disappointed!!!The story is repetitive at times. Also, there is too much attention to detail. I think Ms. Auel spent too much time writing this book. I found myself skimming over the descriptions to get back to the story.Too many new character introductions, some of which have detailed story lines and then are never mentioned again.I have loved all of Jane Auel's other books and hope that the next book in the Children of the Earth series is more like her other books.I usually abhor abridged books but think that in this case it might be a better choice.If you do not have the other books in the sereis borrow it from the library or from someone that already has it."
2,SHELTERS OF STONE - A Disappointment,"I have read the other books in the series and waited anxiously for this one. This latest is so repetitive that I don't really believe Jean Auel wrote it. An example is that the Mother's Song is about three pages long and is repeated three times. When Ayla is introduced to members of Jondalar's family, the lengthy formal introduction is repeated each time she meets a new member, and there are about two hundred members. It is not until about the last three chapters that the book picks up the pace and we begin to get a story line. Maybe this is where Jean began to write. The novel could be considerably condensed by tightening up the prose and eliminating the redundancy. Where was the editor? I felt embarrassed for the author. I probably will read the final book, but I certainly hope it is an improvement."
2,I wonder if Ayala could walk on water....,"....because she could do everything else.I have read all of Auel's Earth's Children series and I have to say that is book was a disappointment.First off, the characters are all one-dimensional, boring and predictable. We all know that Ayala can do, say or wear anything and it'll turn out to be ""right"". Jondalar is such a wuss, lol. I mean, does he ever disagree with Ayala or get over his insecurities of every man desiring ""Ms. Perfect""?Another thing are the explicit sex pages. Ok, how many times to we have to know when Jondalar is going down on her? Yes, yes...feels great; I love it too but there are so many times you can read about it before you start turning pages 3 at a time to skip over the taudry and tedious 3rd rate, quasi-porn.All and all this book was NOT her best. I'm really wondering if Ayala will ever see her son, Durc again. Maybe Jean should concentrate on giving the readers what they want! THat loose end needs to be tied!"
2,She lost her touch...,"I read the other books of this series all in a day each... this ""The Shelters of Stone"" has been at my night-stand for weeks and I am only half-way through it... Mrs. Auel this time takes to long describing things, people and places, and the story itself never takes off... a great disappointment after a 12-year wait."
3,Intro to book 6,"...I feel that the story is very slow in developing in this book. The book doesn't get much into the spirit world, travel, or details of landscape. My hopeful interpretation is that book five is an introduction to book six, and that book six will bring the adventure back. Let's hope we won't have to wait more than a year for book six."
3,If I had not bought it I might not have...,"I should have read the book first. I never listen to critics or book reviewers, and I should have. The book was O.K. That is a very mild term for a book that, having taken 12 years to write, should have been a WOW. I have been a faithful reader of the Series, and I honestly expected The Shelters of Stone to have just as much ""punch"" as the prior books...it looks like Jean Auel got bored with this series and, realizing she has one more to do, repeated herself ad nauseum. I will read her final book in the series, but I won't buy it unless it is at least fifty times better than Shelters of Stone."
2,Big disappointment,"There was no character development in this book. The characters were either perfect beyond belief or just downright bad and lazy. The protaganists, Ayla and Jondalar, have become one dimensional and boring. The antagonists don't actually create any conflict worth writing about. The book is unbearably repetitive, and the physical background descriptions were endless. Too much of the book spent time reiterating what had happened in previous books, I think unnecessarily. Or maybe I've just matured in the past 12 years and expect more...What a letdown."
1,LOOSING HER TOUCH..,"Jean Auel started out with an exciting story of Ayla, but threw the series, she slowly either lost interest or just forgot how to write. She is loosing her followers, who have watched Ayla grow. All hopes for Ayla to return someday, and find her son Derk are all but lost, as the books become more boring and seem to only fill pages with gibberish. The #6 book in the series is not out yet, but I think I will read threw the pages before I buy it, to see if its worth the purchase."
2,romance fans only,"If you have to know how Ayla's world turns out (Will she perform heart transplants? Power Zelandonii civilization with cold fusion? Tame a mammoth instead of eating it?) then by all means read this book. And, I think if you are a fan of Romance Fiction, like Nora Roberts or Diana Galbadon (sp?), then you would probably enjoy it.If, however, you want a gritty exposition of the human ice age, forget about it. Or, read the book for amusement value. Otherwise, read Clan of the Cave Bear and stop there. That book managed to be a great piece of storytelling. Shelters of Stone is a tired piece of romance fiction from an author who is obviously tired of writing the series.Best thing I can say about it: it is MUCH better than Plains of Passage, a throwaway effort on the part of Auel."
1,book was missing appx 50 pages,I recieved the book and appx half way through reading it I found that around 50 pages were missing! evidently a factory mistake so evidently a factory second someone got on the cheap then passed it on to me!
4,To Dang much money for these but what can you do.,I did make it down for the spendy bit it cost. They just want to much for this book this way. I am sorry but I bought my paperback edition of it for only $4.00 so don't tell me that this way is worth $9 that sucks
5,Shelters of Stone,The book is just the one I needed to fill in the gap on the series. I will probably reread the series one of these days.Thank you.
3,not too great,"Was not up to her usual exciting story of these people, am reading 6 now maybe will be better as all will have to come together,"
1,All that research and no substance!,"I have been one of Ms. Auel's addicted readers throughout her entire series. I fought my way through The Shelters of Stone for the first 275 pages and finally tossed it aside. Replay, Replay, Replay. I enjoyed the five page spread on the caves in France in one of the 2001 editions of National Geographic significantly more. 13 million copies printed of The shelters of Stone! My copy got trashed. A great disappointment to this previous fan."
4,Transition,"After waiting 11 years, I was thrilled and disappointed. Thrilled to finally have book 5 here. Disappointed, as not much happened. There isn't the ""drama"" to this volume that appeared in earlier. No threats to Jondalar and Ayla's relationship, no threats to their lives, no real cultural problems or fitting in problems. What I do see is Jean setting the scene for the next volume.We will see the resolution of Ayla becomming Zelandoni, there will be some interaction with the clan, and Ayla did make some enemies. I expect to see more drama with them in book 6.All in all, an enjoyable, light read."
2,Dreary,"Jean Auel has written 5 books in this series. This one is the poorest. It drags, page after page, it drags. It is repetitious to the point where I skipped whole paragraphs. Much of it is re-hashes the previous books. The sex appears to be added as an afterthought to relieve the boredom. I kept hoping, but nothing ever happened that grabbed my attention. ""Valley of the Horses"" was fascinating, it sits in my bookcase and I'll re-read every couple of years. Shelters of Stone I'll donate to the local libary."
3,A Disappointment,"After waiting all of these years for Auel's latest book, this book (like the Plains of Passage before it) was a disappointment. The book is far too full of background material (by book five readers should be clear about the story) and the dialogue leaves a great deal to be desired. Near page 400 the book picks up slightly, but falls off again and never regains speed. Auel's first three books are a delight and a must-read. This last book is yet another transition book (like book four) and leaves the reader baffled. In 12 years the author couldn't seem to get it right, and that's a shame. Do your wallet a favor: buy the paperback."
3,"Too many pages, so little time","Unlike the first 4, I can ""live"" without Jondolar and Ayla for a while. I thought after 12 years of waiting for this book, a lot of new ground would have been covered. I would have hoped that more than 12 months of their life would have been revealed. There was just too much time spent on repetition and detail to the land. I was more interested in the characters life and what they had been doing for the last 12 years! My imagination wondered more years than the actual pages. Oh well.Maybe the next book will complete their journey and purpose in life as told by the one who has so masterfully created them."
2,ZZZZZ!!,"I'm in agreement with everyone else. I was disappointed in SoS because of the long, detailed, repetious explaination of everything. One positive point. It did pickup speed towards the end which will perhaps make the sequel a better work. Good luck Jean!"
2,12 years of waiting...,"I'll admit to being one of those fans that read the first four books in this series 15 times a piece! They were wonderful. But after waiting the twelve years it took Auel to write this fifth book, I was sorely disappointed.The style, the excitement and the herbalism i had grown to treasure in the other Ayla books were really lacking in this one. The rehashing of old stuff was over the top, and I think the editor didn't do such a great job of catching the repitition Auel insisted on writing. I guess it would have been helpful for someone who hadn't read the other books in the series, but even then, some of the repition was within this same story!Had i not known better, i would have believed this book written by a totally different person.On the flip side, if you are a die-hard fan such as myself, this book is a must. If only to offer us hope for the next one!"
1,"Repetition, repetition, reputation","Wonderful series prior to this. Shelters of Stone, however, tarnishes Jean M. Auel's reputation. Quite frankly, I don't believe she wrote it herself."
1,Boring,I really enjoyed the other books. I too was looking forward to this one. But nothing ever happens. The descriptions are too long and the story is very redunant. I skippped over page after page until I finally decided to put it down.
1,Disappointed,I liked Clan of the Cave Bear but Auel gradually slipped more and more into cheap sex novels as she went along with the series. Shelters of Stone should be sold in porn shops.
2,Long Awaited--Kind of Disappointed,After eagerly awaiting the 5th book for over 10 years I find myself disappointed in it. It was very slow going at the beginning and introduced too many new characters who didn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything. Brukeval and Laramar could have been made into better antagonists but were left kind of hanging. Don't get me wrong...I loved her first three books and the fourth was alright but I guess I expected more out of the fifth book because it took so long to be finished. Hopefully the 6th book won't take as long and will be better than the 5th.
2,not the edition pictured.,I thought I was getting a hardback and mine has a different cover. It's pretty tired looking so if I decide to keep the series I'll probably get a different one.
3,Still tiresome!,"Tedious in some areas and almost like a history book! I think the author spent way too much time researching the surrounding area, plants and animals when they were already mentioned in the previous books. Also too much reviewing of what happened in the other books. If you read this one, there's no need to read the others before this and way too long. Seems like the author sticks in the sexual scenes in odd places like the publishers told her to in order to sell books! These too were tedious, too!"
4,"A ""must read"" book",This book goes with the others books in this series and is a great read. Well worth the money and very gripping.
2,The Shelters of Stone - Book - Jean Auel,This book took a long time to arrive from the supplier and was not as shown - in fact I had time to read the last book in this series (1248 pages - large print) before I got a chance to read this one - and they were ordered at the same time. It was a much smaller novel and the print was smaller than I had expected that I would receive. The condition of the book was not bad but there were a lot of folded pages on the inside. I don't dispute that the price was a great deal but I do wish that the supplier had said more about the condition of the book before I purchased it.
4,Don't understand the bad reviews,"I thought Shelters of Stone was as good as the other Earth Children books, maybe not quite as exciting as some, but still very good.Yes, there were lots of descriptions, but ALL of Ms. Auel's books have had as many. It wouldn't have been an Earth Children book if there wasn't.Personally, I just don't understand why so many thought the book wasn't good. I can't wait to read the last one!"
2,Enough already!,"I read the first 4 books in the Earth's Children series as they were first released. I've been re-reading them, including this latest book, in anticipation of the sixth book being released in March 2011.Holy Cow! I thought my remembrances of long rambling sentences and overdone passages might have been wrong, but if anything, it is worse than i recalled. The author is a fan of repetition, and finding obsolete synonyms to use for descriptive purposes, then beating them to death as though that would bring the words back into the common lexicon.And enough with the overdone, overblown, overly descriptive vanilla caveman sex. We get it already."
2,Ebook version of poor quality,"I cannot recommend the ebook version of this book. Assuming the print version was edited properly, I would probably give this novel 4 stars. However, there were so many errors in the ebook, I was never able to immerse myself in the story. The errors would jolt me and return me to the real word. The last third or fourth of the last chapter had 6 errors. It was often difficult to figure out what the correct word was."
3,Kindle edition riddled with errors and typos.,What on earth was used to convert the book to Kindle format? It's full of typos and punctuation problems as if a software program did a BAD conversion job and no one bothered to check for errors. It's annoying and should be sold at a discount to make up for it. Like the previous reviewer said - it's a reading distraction.
3,The Shelters of Stone: with Bonus Content [Kindle Edition],I read this book years ago in hard copy. I recently purchased the kindle edition (I can change the text size) and was disappointed that there are numerous spelling errors in the kindle edition. These errors don't exist in the printed version. It appears the publisher is not making the due dilegence effort for ebooks to avoid stupid mistakes.
2,Shelters of Stone,"Don't believe the hype.The massive amount of research which clearly went into this book does not make it a good story. There's no plot; no tension; no suspense. Much of it is actually a clip show, with Ayla and Jondalar endlessly rehashing their past adventures and inventions. Nothing of note happens. A & J return to the Zelandonii, mate, and have a kid. There are hints of conflict with the Clan but nothing happens. The characters are plastic, too-perfect people and the writing is slow, static and rife with both authorial intrusion and needless info-dumps.Pages of truly bad rhyming religious doggerel -- which are, along with much else in the book, repeated several times -- add a touch of ludicrous awfulness.It's boring. Skip it."
2,Fans only,"What is this series? I guess it is romance, in the same genre as those thick novels with a woman and Fabio on the cover. If one starts this book with that in mind, you won't be disappointed. It still has Ayla inventing everything and healing everyone, and Jondalar is still an amusingly dumb blond with one endearing attribute. The animal friends are still there, wowing the prehistoric residents of France. Auel still manages to make sex scenes tiresome -- singlehandedly she may keep teenagers from having sex because she makes it seem so boring.But a fun bubble-head read nonetheless. Smart of the publisher to release this book in May -- it is the perfect beach read."
2,Boring! Long-winded! Very little plot!,"What is she doing to this series? Clan of the Cave Bear was magnificent. Valley of the horses was interesting. Mammoth Hunters was tantalizing. Plains of passage was barely entertaining. This book is even less entertaining. She doesn't answer questions. What happened to Durc? Surely there is a lot more to his story and the flatheads then this. Surely, there has to be more going with the original clan. I mean, where is the story? She just rehashes everything again and again and it takes pages and pages and pages to get any plot. She is slow writer and I can't believe I waited this long for this thing. I feel like a flathead for actually reading this thing."
3,Glad Ayla found the People but...,"The Auel series has its up and downs. I do like this book because I think Ms.Auel has talent and after reading it, I went back to the begining to re-read the whole series. I think this book is great if you want to know what happens when Ayla meets Jondalar's family and tribe. I also agree that Ayla is a superwoman (no one in fiction or non-fiction could be this wonderful). I would like to see Ayla have a strong female rival in the last book. I also think Ms.Auel needs to learn that basic rule of writing ""show don't tell..."" I am sick of hearing about ""vivid blue eyes."" Also the sex scenes, I just skip them now. I don't think they need to be there in ""vivid detail."""
1,Very Disappointing,"I always like the Earth's Children series and I eagerly awaited the release of the 5th book. I was greatly disappointed with it. I found it very dragging, repetitive and had no definite plot going on. It was very long but it had no actual substance. It's suppose to be the 2nd to the last of the series...it left me bored to tears. I do hope the 6th and final book would have an exciting conclusion."
2,Terrible,"A bad book made worse by the fact it took twelve years to write. I really cannot add anything else that has not already been said. Ayla is the source of all technology, she discovers/invents every tool that ever existed. She is perfect in every way, shape and form. Far from making mistakes as she did in Clan of the Cave Bear, she executes every form of etiquette perfectly, no matter how new or strange it is to her.The book is poorly written, with cardboard characters that have no believablity. It's poorly edited, with massive amounts of repetition and run-on sentences. Entire sections of the book can be skipped with no loss to the story. Auel never seemed to catch on to the idea that a book can be short, and still be good.I won't go on any longer, because everything that needs to be said has been said in the spotlight reviews."
2,A disappointment in a wonderful series,"I too eagerly awaited Shelters of the Stone, as I had so enjoyed the first books in the series. I too am very let down by the lack of spirit and repetitious passages of this book. I was recently disappointed by Diana Gabaldon's latest novel The Fiery Cross, after rating her series one of my all time favorites. Maybe I expected too much of these last novels since they were so long in coming, but I am not waiting with eager anticipation for any follow up books. However, I will probably read them only because of my long-time loyalty to the series."
1,Shelters of Padding,"Was she paid by the word? If so, she earned her money. Every sentence in this looong, slow and dreary novel was repeated, rehashed, resaid and reiterated numerous times. The book could (and should) have been a quarter of the length it is. The dialogue is unbelieveable at best, the psychological insights hilariously anachronistic. The only genuine feeling is when cave drawings are described. The sex scenes obligatory every 75 pages are a howl and the fashions are to die for. Read it if you must, but Jean Auel has lost the touch and produced a really bad, padded monstrosity of a wooly mannoth."
1,Boooring!!!,"Ugh...how much can one read about the landscape...the rocks...the rivers??? and Ayla & Jondalar having sex?? I skipped through most of the book and was still bored. What a disappointment, after waiting so many years!I do not recommend this book to anyone.I won't be reading any other sequals of the Earth's Children after this one!!"
2,Good practice for speed reading,"Not only does absolutely nothing happen in this book, but it is so poorly presented that you really don't want to spend too much time reading this. Skip the long paragraphs, skim through the vast majority of the dialogue, forget about the poem, and wait for book #6. Hopefully, the last book (#6 is supposedly the last) will buck the trend of the series going from good to bad as it progresses."
1,this series is really getting stale now,"I absolutely adored book one, loved book three and quite liked two and four but I'm getting really bored now. The endless, endless repetitions of the stories of their journey, the constant reactions to the animals, the characters agonising over the same things again and again...... If you cut out about half of it, then it might be a good book, as it is.....don't waste your money"
1,disappointment - where was the editor here????,"I enjoyed the first four books, but couldn't believe this was written by the same author. Slow, painfully repetitive, and WAY too long for very little plot development. I made myself finish it (skimming the last half) just because I wanted to know ""what happened"" - in case there's a next book. Not sure I'll even read any next book at this point unless the author and editor make a concerted effort to trim. Also not sure why author has to make Ayla the inventor of all human advancements - first to tame a horse, first to use a spear thrower, first to use a sewing needle, etc. Talk about a Renaissance woman! Makes the character that much more unbelievable!"
2,"Sadly, a disappointment","Jean Auel's ""Earth's Children"" series would have been limited to a single novel had ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" been written in the same tedious fashion. Ms. Auel's eagerly awaited fifth novel of the series, ""The Shelters of Stone"" is a study in excrutiating, minutiae. The reader makes progress across this vast and wonderous landscape with a magnifying glass, never seeing anything beyond the short focus of the lens. I confess to quitting the book after 260 odd pages. Ms. Auel is, in my opioion, an incredibly talented author, otherwise, I would have quit 100 pages sooner. Perhaps this was a 100 page novel that was filled with an additional 600 pages of very finely crafted descriptive verbage. I guess I'll never know."
2,What Happened?,"I have been a fan of this series since Cave Bear was first published. My favorite book was Valley of Horses. When I heard Shelters was on the shelves, I ran straight out and bought it and was planning on devouring it that night.That was on the day it first hit the shelves and I just got through reading it. It was like walking up a sand dune with a 50lb pack on my back. I had to make myself read it.Maybe it is a setup for the next book, that's the only thing I can think of. Like The Empire Strikes Back. It set up Return of the Jedi and that was about all. I'm trying to convey as much respect as I can to Ms Auel, as I do admire and respect her work. I have a BA in Anthropology, and believe me, she's done her homework.I was so starved for something profound to happen in this book, I was actually hoping Jondalar would bite the dust in a hunting accident towards the end. But, what more is there for them to do? They've completed the journey and there are no more worlds to conquer."
1,Fresh Voices Needed!,"After a decade, both Jean Auel and Robert Waller produced follow-ups to previous hits. I read both and wished I had not wasted my time nor money. Shelters of Stone and A Thousand Country Roads both lacked inspiration and originality. I will not turn instead to fresh voices in literature. Try ""Lost Nation"" by Jeffrey Lent or ""Shade of the Maple"" by Kirk Martin for refreshing, lyrical prose that is fresh and compelling."
2,The Shelters of Stone,"Shame on you, Jean. After 12 years of waiting this was a huge disappointment. No action, nothing new. I've re-read the other books in the series over the past 12 yrs., but will not be re-reading this one! Sorry I bought it. Should've just borrowed it from the library."
2,A 12 Year wait and this is the best she could do?,"Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.How could there have been a 12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books? How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant? Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over? Where is the plot, the suspense, the action?I do not recommend buying this book, get on the waiting list at the library."
3,"Its all Auel, but not quite the same","I actually found this book to be a let down. I felt as though Auel was just setting up the scene for her last installment and barely brushing the surface of her characters, their emotions, and conflicts.I still gave it 3 stars because I am, like others, just addicted to this series. Its a good read for those who follow the series, and hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the last book."
4,Shelters of Stone,"I think that the book was amazingly well written, and it carried us through meeting all of Jondalar's kin. Carried over from the Shelters of Stone, Ayla is pregnant, and she has a baby. Ayla encounters many hardships from people who doubt her medical knowledge because of her upbringing. We are introduced to the Zelondonni, the women Jondalar used to love. Over all, this book stands up to it's 12 year wait."
3,Worth reading for fans but not as good as previous books,"...The story has good continuity with previous books but is a bit heavy on description of landscape and review of first four books. I enjoyed Shelters of Stone...If you're not a big fan, you can wait till it comes out in paperback."
4,If you have read the other four....,"then you will apreciate this book. But it did tend to ramble. For those of us who are used to Auel's style, it was not a huge surprise. At times I felt as though I was re-reading all the books over again. I felt however that it was really satisfying to read overall, and I recomend it to all who have enjoyed the series."
3,Drawn out. Okay. Needs more action and personality.,I like page turners...Story was good. Just that I expected more from such a best seller.
1,Jean Auel's ultra-liberal world view has gone crazy!!,"I loved Auel's first 4 books. But this new book has gone over the top with politics and ultra radical liberalism. Lets be honest, Ayla now represents radical feminism taken to insane levels. I can't stretch my imagination far enough to possibly believe that life could have ever been so perfect back then. It doesn't matter that its 10,000 years ago, Ayla has mastered birth control, gets drunk, sleeps around, is a strong leader, hunts, fishs, is a medical guru and completes every other masculine task known to man. She also teachs the entire tribe to accept severe racial differences. I'm surprised Auel didn't have Ayla somehow attending college in Berekely! Lets be real, do you really think this could have happenend in such a harsh enviroment where survival was at stake every second of the day? I just don't buy it and I think Jean Auel is trying to shove her politics down our throat. Read at you own risk."
4,I Liked the Story,"I was surprised to see the negative reviews on this book. Picky, picky! Are the negative reviewers all published authors too? Or maybe just professional critics? Jeesh! I thought it was a great story and really enjoyed it...in fact I've reread it a couple of times. It was a nice visit back to the characters in the original series."
5,Excellent read :),"I finished the book last night and it is excellent. It does help if you know the other four books before it, but Jean does explain the background of alot of situations throughout the book. Welcoming Jondular home and getting to know his family is excellent.....Ayla fits in quite well despite her differences. The book brings you through her pregnancy, their mating, the birth, and also the birth of the new baby for Whinney. Even wolf makes a friend fo his own kind too. Lots of new chartacters to get to know...... makes me look forward to a more careful second reading. And yes there is sharing of Pleasures for Ayla and Jondular, not as many as I thought there would be for such a big book.... but the ones there are excellent and well done ;) Even the characters that do not get along with Ayla and her background get you into the book and wanting more. Ayla and Jondular are back and enjoy it!!!"
2,Too long between books,"When I found out Jean Auel had a new book out, I bought the hard cover not wanting to wait for the soft to come out. That was a mistake. I have been a big fan of Jean Auel for years, and have read her previous books numerous times. Shelter of Stone however left much to be desired. Her detailed description of ""everything"" was a bit much. I enjoy a good detailed book, but this one was overdone. I had to force myself to pick the book back up and continue reading it. The first five hundred pages were slow going, but after that, things picked up and it was easier to read. Hopefully her next book will be less descriptive of rocks and ledges and more of the story of Ayla and her new homeland."
2,And I was so excited......,"This book was such a let down, I almost want my money back. I had been griping for years about the Earth's Children series and where in the world was that new book. I was so excited to finally to see the book alive and in print that I bought the first copy that I saw and settled myself in for an absorbing session. Imagine my surprise when I encountered all the other books mushed together in 750 pages of dry, tasteless reading. The repetition of the background of Ayla and Jondolar was really..... bad. I am trying to not sound harsh but I would only recommend this book if you go buy it used in paperback. We will see if the 6th book can recoup my faith in this series."
3,A watered down version of 'The Mamouth Hunters',"I borrowed this book from the library after been put off from buying it after reading the comments on this board. I am one of those male readers that thoroughly enjoyed the first 4 books up to now. The Clan of the Cave Bear ranks as my favorite book of all time.This time, however, I felt like I was reading the Mamouth Hunters all over again, although with new characters. The same story tended to unfold an there was never any new direction in the story that made me take notice and increase my enthusiasm level. In some ways, this book reminds me of a typical flashback episodes we see in some TV programs. I enjoyed this book - it was good but certainly not as great as the other ones. I felt like the soul of the series was missing here....Here's hoping that the last book will have Ayla searching for Durc..."
1,The Shelter of Ennui,"Having gloried in the first four Auel books, I was anxiously awaiting this present volume. What a disappointment! After four tales of high adventure around which were couched loads of information about stone age living, we come to this new effort. I have slogged through the first 300 pages of this tome, and now it rests on the shelf. (Editing out reduncancies and there might be a worthwhile thirty page read here). In those first 300 pages nothing more exciting happens than a dirty trick involving clothing and a death at a hunt, providing I suppose a plot ploy to expose Ayla's healing powers. Not much high dudgeon here. Frankly, the book reads more like ... manual for the stone age then a tale fashioned by a writer who proved capable of excellence in her earlier works.`"
3,"Not Great, but not terrible either","Great research, thin plot.It seems like Mrs. Auel is trying to set-up for book six.The entire ending was very rushed.Where Plains of Passage was wordy with landscape description, this was wordy with 'The Mother's Song' and people repeating each other's formal names over and over and over.Book One remains my favorite.At least we shouldn't have to wait so long for book six since Mrs. Auel is getting older."
4,Better than many of the reviews,"OK--maybe it wasn't the best of the series--but it was the best one in the past ten years. Seriously, the book did seem to show signs of repition and we did spend alot of time re-hashing the plot lines of the previous 4 books, but if you haven't read the other books--or its been 10 or more years since your read the books---it was nice to be reminded about important plot lines that one may have forgotten. I enjoyed this book very much. I think the best thing I can say is that when I finished the last page I was ready to pick up book 6. Unfortunately,it appears we will have to wait another year or so to see it published."
4,Yes it is repetative but...,"I see that many reviewers got frustrated with the repetitive nature of this book. Yes Ayla's appearance and speech are talked about often. Yes, introductions with Wolf happen often.But Auel has always done that. She goes into depth. That is what she does. In some instances I feel it is too much depth, but no more in this book than the others of the series.While I admit it did get bit tedious in places, I would not say that it made the book that much worse than the others. I still love Shelters of Stone as much as the others. The characters are amazing. They do grow deeper each book. I love the story of Ayla and will read the next (and from what I hear final) book of the Earth's Children series.If you liked the others, definitely give this one a try as well."
3,Great introduction to book six,"This book was excellent - as an introduction to the next book in the series. There's really not a main climactic point, just a series of lesser ups and downs. There are a few great moments - mostly anything taking place in a cave - that make the whole thing worthwhile. This book has taken a lot of flak, but if the point of this book was to introduce everything that is to come in the next book, it served its purpose."
5,"Lively and involving, as are the protagonists","Familiarity with prior novels in Auel's prehistoric 'Earth's Children' series will contribute to both background and an appreciation for Shelters Of Stone, the continuing story of Ayla and her love Jondalar. The prehistoric couple complete their cross-Europe journey to great Jondalar's people and find welcome and a few who view their union with suspicion. Can Ayla fit in and prove her worth? The details of prehistoric setting and concerns are lively and involving, as are the protagonists."
4,Entertaining,"An entertaining continuation of the story of the life is Ayla , very enjoyable reading. I recommend the book to her fans."
1,Tedious,"Boring and tedious! Repetitious story line both from earlier books and from within this story -- how many times do you have to tell Ms Auel, I'm not stupid, you know. Hard-to-remember names, and an error-ridden Kindle transcription add to this reader's frustration. I'm new to Kindle and wonder if all Kindle books are subject to transcription errors or did someone forget to edit this one? Tell you what, Amazon, let me be an advance reader, give me the titles for free and I'll edit for you."
4,Language problems with Kindle book,"I loved this book- I read it years ago and have re-read the entire series in preparation for the newest book coming out. However, this time I read it on my kindle and noticed SEVERAL typo's and even lots of words in another language! I found this annoying and distracting at times. I can't wait for the last book to come out!"
3,The Plains of Passage,"Somewhere in the middle of ""The Plains of Passage"" - Jean Auel left! The ""Shelters of Stone"" - her notes! Who took over & finished the 'Passage' & put together 'Stone'? Where did she go?! Do I dare purchase & read her new one?"
1,What a Disappointment!,"The much-hyped, long awaited continuation of the saga of Ayla and Jondalar is finally here, and what a non-event it has turned out to be. The characters have turned to cardboard, the plot is plodding and, judging from the repetition and belabored descriptions, Auel must have been paid by the word for this mammoth disappointment. Auel's meticulous research and knowledge of the paleolithic era are, as always, superb--but that's not enough to elevate this potboiler to the level of her previous works.Since nothing happened or was resolved in this volume, there's sure to be another. I only hope Ms. Auel doesn't make us wait another ten years, and that she is able to capture the magic of her earlier work, so sadly lacking in Shelters of Stone."
2,Eep.,"I read the first book, I was hooked. I read the second book, and it was pretty good. I read the third book and started to get disinterested. I read the fourth book and I was disapointed on the focus of constant sex and how much of a heroine Ayla was. The fifth book, sadly, follows in this pattern.Not only is there an *extreme* amount of sex, but Ayla being 'accepted' seemed forced. And the fact she keeps discovering things upsets me. Flint, 'spear-thrower', sewing, taming animals, ect, it's just very overdone.Ayla has no real flaws, which I think, is a huge problem when reading this story, as the reader has nothing to identify with.I've heard people talk about a story about Durc and what happens to him. I think after Valley of Horses, that might have been the better idea."
1,Very bad writing,1 Part minimal story advancement + 9 parts rehashing previous novels and/or actually redoing things done in the previous novels...I think I will skip the 6th one when (if) it ever comes out...
1,Repeat Repeat Repeat,It was sooo disappointing...save your hard earned cash and buy something else or you can wait until it shows up at your local yardsale. This book was no not worth the wait and not worth my cash...
2,ENOUGH WITH THE EXPLICIT SEX !,"I found the books for the most part enjoyable. Unfortunately, as with the other Earth's Children books, I was again disappointed to find myself reading (and in the case of the current book, listening to) sexually explict details that should be saved for magazines sold only behind the counter. If not for these graphic passages, which add absolutely nothing to the story line, the books would be a delight to read. In fact, I can see the series being read by preteens and teens alike. The fictional books might even spur a kid's interest in history, geography or anthropology. Auel's books would merit a better rating but for the passages containing detailed sexual content randomly scattered throughout. Okay, some folks enjoy erotica and that's fine -- go to a porn bookstore to get your jollies. The Earth Children Series is a good read without adding gratuitous sex to the mix. So, how about some new editions sans the porno, please."
2,What happened?,"Other reviewers were spot on when they mentioned that most of this book was little more than a rehash of previous books. It makes me so sad - the fascination I felt when I first started reading about this world, such as the craft-making, taming of animals, etc. has been stripped away, repetition by repetition. I especially disliked the gratuitous sex scenes that have replaced the warm intimate moments between Ayla and Jondalar. I ended up skipping them to get to more interesting parts, except I found out there weren't very many at all. As I got to the end of the book, I realized I had skipped at least three quarters of the book, because most of it was repetition ad nauseum about Ayla's wonderful character. I used to think Ayla was wonderful too, but she's just not believable anymore ever since she became ""Super Ayla, Master of the Universe""."
2,Mostly a Review of Previous Books,"Jean Auel needs to break out of her mold of trying to make the latest book a stand alone book for new readers. With the latest book this technique has gotten unmanagable. She spent at least a third of the book going over material covered in previous books. She needs to understand that this is a series and she should assume that her readers have read the previous books. If she wanted to include the old material in a short prologue to bring those who haven't read the other books up to date, this would work, since those who have read the previous books could just skip it. As it was, I found this book boring. It was a big disappointment!!"
3,Where is the rest of the book?,"I just finished this book, but it is definitely not a cohesive, self-contained story like the other 4 books. I shouldn't have bought hardback. Jean Auel has a great story to tell, but unfortunately she does not tell it very well in this installment."
2,DON'T READ AND PRETEND YOUR STILL WAITING!,"I had to give it two stars because the years of waiting and hype gave me much more entertainment than the book did. I have yet to read a more dissapointing book. After years of waiting... years of Jean explaing she's taking her time to get it right... and this is the result? You meet Jondalar's people, one by one, and hear again and again (and again) the ""formal introductions"", the explanation of wolf, the horses and spear throwers. Most of the ""new"" dialogue makes me think it's set in the 1980's. One can overlook the grammatical errors (there are numerous), but they should be an embarrassment to everyone that OK'd the book. I hate to say it, but this is not a good novel. I found myself skipping whole pages just so I could read something that interested me. You can throw out half of this book, and still get bored.I just cannot believe anyone actually read this and said, ""Jean, this is a wonderful book.""WAIT FOR IT IN PAPER BACK... I wish I had."
1,"Same old, same old...but worse","Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250. It is all review. Auel should assume that people who are reading this book have read the others and should not spend 250 pages re-hashing what we already know. We already know people will be ""amazed"" and ""disbelieving"" of Ayla's and Jondalar's previous adventures. We do not need to sit with them while they tell the story to each of Jondalar's relatives.We also already know Ayla and Jondalar ""share pleasures"" more and better than any earthly couple ever did or could. I am not reading this story to get a ""thrill"". In the last book, it got to the point that whenever Auel wrote about pleasures, I just skipped it, because it disturbed the flow of the story. This book was no exception.I want more depth, more story and less review. I haven't given up on the series yet, but if I have to wait another 10 years for the next - I won't be buying it."
1,I couldn't put it down...,"...mostly because I kept telling myself, ""I know there's a plot here somewhere. If I keep looking, I'll run into it any minute."" Alas, I was mistaken. Honestly, folks, this book's entire storyline can be summed up in a couple of sentences, and not very interesting ones at that. If Reader's Digest is still doing condensed versions of books, they might be able to make a readable copy of SoS, but, I, for one, have no intention of wading through this mess again. I really enjoyed the first four novels, and my copies of those are in pretty shabby condition from rereading, but this one's going to stay pristine. If you're looking for rich characterization and a top-notch story, try Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series - at least he releases a new one every couple of years."
1,Pre-Historic Nancy Drew meets Kama Sutra,"What a disappointment!! I really expected a story, plot & character development after a 12 year wait and 800 pages. What I got was a boring formula written book with lots of rehashing of old material and characters turned into cartoons of themselves. The one good thing that came from this book is that now I don't like any of the characters and really don't care what happens to them! I'm cured!"
2,Nothing new here.....700+ pages of rerun,What a bitter disapointment/a repeat of all books up to now/she meets the zelandoni they are scared of her/ they grow to accept her she has Jondalars child book ends with her agreeing that she is a Zelondona their name for mog-ur or mamuti. Some of the pages seemed word for word from her other books. It was clear this book was written for profit not because she had nanyrthing new or interesting to add........
1,The mammoths mate again,"Once again, Jean Auel's gigantic sprawling saga of Ayla (proving that there were preppies in the Stone Age)staggers to its' feet and lurches forward. The problem is, it lurches forward for something like 700 pages. Ayla has journeyed with Jondalar (her mate) home to his people. All of them have names like Marona, Farona, and my Sharona (sorry about that) and they mostly welcome her. Ayla goes about her usual tall blond medicine woman persona (it's catching) while sharing pleasures with Jondalar, and being the very best cave person she possibly can be. All the while she is tormented that her new family may discover her Neanderthal heritage and tragic past. Let us leave the neolithic Martha Stewart to her pleasures and reread Diana Gabaldon. Forget it."
1,"Waste of money! If you must, check it out of the library.","Mrs. Auel did a brilliant job with her first book, Clan of the Cavebear. Having read everything after, it is painfully obvious she was lucky. All the books after bear out the fact that she should have stayed a housewife, and not pretend to be a professional writer. Someone has taught her how to pad a book with repetitive musings by the main character about events from the first book, ad nauseum. With this latest installment, she has perfected the craft of telling very little story while piling on the number of pages to justify the hardback cover price. I think Mrs. Auel ought to be ashamed of herself for putting out such trash. However, I imagine her aim is to pad her bank account better than she has padded her books."
1,"Rock formation, rock formation, new character...","Rock formation, rock formation, new character... etc.The sad part is, the rock formations are more interesting than the new characters. Just reread the first three and skip the rest of the series."
1,Please -- no more long names!,"I am a huge fan of Auel's earlier books. I enjoyed reading about the certain discoveries of Ayla and Jondalar, the descriptions of the landscape, etc. I looked forward to this book for many years, but it did not live up to my expectations.In a 1,000+ page book, the entire goal was to get to the Summer Meeting. It took 700 pages for Jondalar and Ayla to walk into camp, then finally make the journey to the Summer Meeting. What happened in those 700 pages? Not much.However, there were plenty of name recitals: ""Ayla of the Zelandonii, daughter of the Cave Bear, wife off Jondalar the Traveller and Flint Napper, friend to Whinny and Racer, subject of boring book, creation of Jean Auel"", etc. My guess is that if you took out all of the name recitals, you could knock 100 pages off the book.Sadly, a tedious and uninteresting book. Auel's done much, much better."
3,Enjoyed the Book,"I almost did not buy the book after the negative reviews that were posted, but I did eventually purchase it and enjoyed it very much. This is the one I have been waiting for, where Ayla gets to settle in and really work on her identity - instead of the other books (which I also enjoyed) where there was change and high drama every few chapters. The conflicts were subtle but continuous and I felt that Ayla and Jondular became more ""real,"" encountering people and problems that we can relate to. As for the detail, while there is quite a bit, I also enjoyed it and even went out on a successful hunt in the local woods and found / used soapwort as well as a few other things as described in the book."
1,This book could have been written in 100 pages...,"I am a big fan of the Earth's Children series and was looking forward to reading the latest novel. There appeared to be no major plot developed in this book. The repition drove me insane -- how many times can you describe how to ""introduce"" yourself to wolf (in excessive detail)? How many times can you describe how Ayla came to tame a wild horse (in excessive detail)?I believe that the book did a good job of setting up the final book in the series, but I am confident that I could have skipped book 5 and not missed anything of importance."
1,"Oh, please..........",Pre-historic drivel......I forced myself to read almost every word....the alternative entertainment would be drilling holes in my head with a slow drill. Even the sex scenes were cut and pasted from earlier work......And how many dramatic inventions and cultural innovations can one gorgeous 19 year old come up with? Please.......And we had a contest at our house: who could aloud read from 'The Mother's Song' the longest without dissolving in laughter. Is this a humorous book?
1,Where was her editor?????,"I was excited to get this book, but quickly became disappointed in it. I almost started counting how many times someone remarked on what a beautiful couple Ayla and Jondalar make. There is no focus. The point of view is so spread around I started expecting to see points of view from various animals who happened to see the couple. In her earlier books, she had that tight focus of one or two points of view, which made for more tension and drew the reader into the characters. Not in this one.And the constant repititions of observations and various processes for making things made up at least a third of the book.So I ask - where was her editor? Was Ms. Auel padding for word count? She dragged a simple story into a huge, boring tome. As much as I want to see what happens next, if her next book looks as large, I won't waste my money on the hardcover..."
4,"GREAT, IF YOU LIKED THE OTHERS CONTINUE AND READ THIS ONE","THIS WAS THE 3RD BEST IN THE SERIES (MY OPINION)....IF YOU READ THE FIRST 4 YOU HAVE TO READ THIS ONE....THE SERIES IS GREAT, VERY ENJOYABLE....WHILE THIS IS FICTION, I WONDER HOW MUCH CAN BE BASED IN REALITY....."
1,Worst Book I have Ever Read!,Jean Auel should return any and all monies she received from the sale of this book to all the tortured readers who had to endure it!
1,I expected too much?,"Just as many other readers, I had almost given up on this series after the last book, but considering Ms. Auel spent so many years on this one, I thought she might offer her readers a fresh and intriguing sequel in The Shelters of Stone.NOT SO....reading 800 pages of bland jibberish is what makes me disappointed. She didn't even have a plot to the story! I appreciated her descriptions of the land and the crafts of the people in the other books as it was a part of the story. This time around, the scenery WAS the story. Did Ms. Auel write this book right after Plains of Passage and simply decide to publish it several years later to build a craving for this release? I thought Plains of passage was weak. I could have written a better sequel.Bottom line: The book was boring..."
3,Mix Review,"The book is slow to start, it basically goes over the past books in a retrospective look. The only ""big"" events were a jilted lover (ex-Promised bride to be) seeking revenge. A marriage that was brushed over quickly. 2 other hateful, vengeful people and the flathead issues, 2 births ~and a soft ending.Apparently Jean is saving the interesting stuff for the next book. Because, Alya is not fessing up about her son. An the theme of FLATHEADS are repeative, as well as that poem about the beginning of the EARTH CHILDREN.Jean we got the POINT, we did not need the same thing pounded over and over again.This book left with a flat feeling. I was hoping for some spice not the bland that was a full half of the book.There is to be a final book ? I percieve so. But next time, I will wait on purchasing it. I think I will wait, until the library gets it in the HOT new arrivals section before blowing money one a book that did not live up to expectations."
2,I waited *how* long for THIS??,"What a disappointment. As an avid ""Earth's Children"" series reader, I waited with breathless anticipation for this next book. Basically ""The Shelters of Stone"" can be summed up as a rehash of previous books, absolutely no plot and no lead-in to the next book. Haven't been this disappointed since ""Star Wars: Episode One."" Nuff said!"
3,"Jean, Get a New Editor!","After waiting 12 years for the next book in the series, I eagerly started plowing through it. Jean Auel is an excellent researcher, and I am very interested in what life was/may have been like for our ur-ancestors. But she is no novelist! The love scenes, introductions, relationships, pop-psychology, what a pot-boiler! This book should have been 1/2 the length. So much happened in the first few days of their return, that it took her 1/2 the 741 pages to tell and retell it. Disappointing, but then, all of the books have been since ""The Clan of the Cave Bear."" She just runs out of steam."
4,Nostalgia trip,"As I was reading this rather thick volume in record time, I realized that it was NINETEEN years since I'd read CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. So much has happened to me and Ayla in that time, and it was a lot like becoming reaquainted with an old friend. The references to earlier stories was helpful, albeit repetitive at times, but I'm anxiously awaiting the final book to see what kind of a Zelandoni Ayla becomes, and what happens between the zelandonii and the Clan people..."
3,MUCH TOO MUCH,"This book was interesting in parts, but very boring in others. There was much too much background information, and I found myself skimming much of the book. The love scene dialog was boring and repetative. I would have liked more information about the characters, and much less information about the geography and the living spaces. Not up to the other titles in this series."
3,Didn't live up to the anticipation,I read this series for the first time in 1991 and have been waiting for this book ever since.I was very disappointed in the Shelter of Stones. The story had no flow and the main character of Ayla and Jondolar were almost written as secondary characters. They had hardly the level of interaction and romance that made the other books so enjoyable. Most of the book was a rehash of what happened in the first 4 books. She waits until the last 100 or less pages to get them married and have the baby.The authoress spent a chapter and a half talking about characters (whom we never got to meet at all) death. Who cares?J.M. Auel spent 12 years doing research for this and it shows. Her time would have been better spent working on character studies.
4,I Liked Shelters of Stone,"I bought Shelters of Stone as soon as it was available. It was a long wait, and I have to say I was relieved to find I enjoyed it thoroughly. My favorite in the series remains the ""Mammoth Hunters"", and my least favorite was ""Plains of Passage"". ""Plains of Passage"" read like a travelogue. I like detail, but hundreds of pages about terrain and moss etc. was a little much. So I was glad to find that with the story back among people that Jean Auel hasn't lost her touch. I can't wait for the 6th book."
4,Deffinately Worth Reading,"This book was very enjoyable. The characters continue to grow throughout the series. I would have liked more interaction between Ayla and Jondalar, perhaps I expected it after the last book where they were traveling alone much of the time. I also missed some of the interaction with the animals. I did find some stories repeditive as they were retold continually throughout the book. Maybe if I hadn't reread the whole series just before starting this book the reviewing of past stories would have been better apreciated. As for the way they introduce a character everytime they meet someone new it could get pretty old. The end of the book was the best part, I was just getting to the story I really wanted to read right before it ended. Overall I would recomend this book to anyone who has already started this series. Hopefully it will not take so many years for Jean M. Auel to get the next one published."
3,Not the worst that could happen,"I love the Earth's Children series, and I've read it at least once a year since I discovered it at the public library about 10 years ago (I was in high school at the time).While this is one of the weaker books in the series, it's NOT the horror that some fans seem to think. It's not even my least favorite. While it's certainly less action/conflict packed than some of the other books, I think (hope) it's working to set up the next two books, and as far as integrating Ayla into Jondalar's society goes it works fairly well.One caveat: If you read the whole series in short succession the repetition (catching up readers who read the series in the wrong order) starts to get to you, as does the somewhat ""Mary Sue"" nature of the Ayla character."
2,"Okay, a little too much of this!","This book was a disappointment to me in that it became very repetitious, much more than it needed to be. Ayla and Jondalar made their way to his people, and people there don't know what to make of her. The book goes on this way for awhile, and gets monotonous.A lot of scenery is described here as well.This is okay, but then, it just goes on a little too much. It has parts where some of the scenes get exciting, but not too often.When you read this, be prepared to yawn a little."
1,Much ado about nothing!,"Unlike the first books in this series, this book is tedious and repetitious. There is no real story or attention getting point in the whole 900+ pages . Without the long naming greetings and repeated explanations of ""feelings"", there is nothing of interest in the book. As an avid reader and also an anthropologist, I found the descriptive passages so trivial as to make me want to stop reading. I only finished it because I was caught on the weekend without anything new to read!The period-- geographic-- descriptions were informative, but still could have ben covered in about ten(10) pages instead of nine hundred (900). I was expecting another great book, but was greatly disappointed."
1,"""Are we almost there?""","This yawner reminds me of seemingly endless car trips when I was a kid. Is it really possible that the author of ""Clan"" wrote this turkey? - a Paleolithic soap opera drowning in herbal tea and endless introductions. I'm thankful I checked it out from the library instead of wasting [X]+, but I still paid 30+ days of fines to tough it out to the end. I think I'll celebrate reaching the end by brushing my teeth with a twig. (Did Jondalar use mouthwash? I forget.)"
3,only OK,"As the other reviewers note, this installment was a let-down. After a 10-year wait for it, I'd imagined great things from an author I'd previously enjoyed. However, my guess is that some of the snippets of character development and interaction will be key to the denoument of the story. So even though the writing is not as compelling as it had been, I still felt compelled to read the whole thing."
2,Falling short...,The excellence of the first 4 books of this series set my expectations for the 5th book. I however am quite disappointed. The characters/situations/nuances are not nearly as well-developed as in prior books. I agree with other reviewers: it is as if Auel is not even the writer here. I understand that there will be a 6th book in the series. I will consider very carefully before deciding to read the next book.
2,What went wrong here?,"Where was the plot? Where was the drama? Where are the fantastic love scenes? I loved Jean Auel's first four novels and I highly recommend them to anyone but ""The Shelters of Stone"" was a huge disappointment."
4,A New Home,"If you are looking for excitement, then this is not your kind of book. But if you have read the four previous Earth's Children books, then you will find great comfort in Ayla and Jondolar settling into a home and family after the travels and travails of their earlier episodes. This book took a long time (1 month) for me to read and I took to it slowly and comfortably. There is repetition in this that could have been omitted which would have reduced the page count of the book, but I do not find the repetition painful at all. This is a slow, quiet read and I certainly have enjoyed Jondolar's ""return home"" with Ayla opening the world of the Zelandonii to others. Be patient with this book and it will reward you."
4,The shelters of stone,"J'attendais ce livre depuis longtemps. Tout le monde de ma famille s'arrache encore les précedents.J'adore la faon dont l'auteur passe d'un livre à l'autre, c'est à dire comme si on tournait à la page suivante du dernier livre...Le livre est un peu lent, on s'y déplace longtemps et souvent, sans aller très loin, et sans une carte des cavernes, on se perd facilement entre l'est et l'ouest, la caverne de l'un ou de l'autre.D'autre part j'ai apprécié la complexité des relations entre les personnes, la perspective pour Ayla de devoir vivre en une mme place longtemps, les politiques et rangs de chacuns et encore et encore l'influence d'Ayla sur un monde qui n'est pas le sien mais où que ses convictions et sa formation l'obligent à s'impliquer...J'attends le prochain livre avec impatience, tant de possibilités se présentent pour un autre excellent livre."
1,Slooooooow,"I was a big fan of Auel, right until this book arrived. It's approximately 700 pages long and it took nearly 500 pages before it starts to get interesting. I skipped chunks of pages because they are pure repitition from earlier in the book. I'll probably buy the next one but only because of the first three and to see how it ends. Hopefully Auel won't let us down. If this book was half the length it would potentially have been great. I was disappointed."
2,Not worth the wait,"Like many readers of the Earth's Children Series, I waited long years for this book to be released. I even took the time to reread the four previous books. I should have stopped after reading Mammoth Hunters. The plot lines ran the same course in Shelters. I was not pleased with Plains of Passage due to the transitory nature of the book and was hoping this would ""pep"" back up the series. If this is what we can expect from Ayla and friends in the future, I would aviod subsequent works. The one bright spot was the hint that the next book might provide something new. How many years will we wait and see this time? I should have been reading my copy of Hansen and Kwaler's ""Stellar Interiors"" for class. It would have been more enjoyable."
3,"Unfortunately, I agree","I have to agree whole heartedly with the first three reviews especially. I find the ""explicit romance"" is similar to reading a romance novel - an entirely different type of book. I was 1/2 way through the book and ""still waiting"" for the ""new"" book to begin, not just a running narrative of her previous ones. I read this book simply because I have read them all and her first book was extraordinary. I read fast and it still took me a week to get through this, it was like watching paint dry it was so boring in places. I really hope 6 and yes, I'll buy that one too, is better than this one. I don't think it could get much worse."
3,Bummed out,"I didn't hate this book, but I was bummed out --I've been waiting for it for 12 years --EAGERLY!Aside from the lack of anything really happening, I was mostly disappointed that Ayla is different now, and not in a way that can be explained by character growth. Suddenly she seems timid when it comes to things that she used to not be timid about. I loved the character of Zelandoni though, and like others, get the sense that alot of stuff will ""come to a head"" so to speak in book 6, but I'm still bummed about this one. I will buy book 6 for closure but I doubt that I will read any other books by this author in the future if she writes another series as I've heard suggested.All I can say, ""WHAT A BUMMER!!""!! Wait for your library to get it or buy it in paperback if you need to know what happens, but save the big bucks of hardcover editions for something else!"
3,Good... but missing something,A very dissapointing addition to the Earth Children's series. The Shelters Of Stone was missing alot of the heart that the previous 4 books had.
1,This book could have been so much better...,"The problem with this book, is that there was no way that Ayla could have met all those people at one time. So we are forced to live through the formal introductions and stating of family ties and titles ad nauseum. We are forced to read and re-read the same scenes each and every time someone meets Wolf or the horses. If that weren't problem enough, we are also forced to suffer through the telling and re-telling (to many different people) of the death of Thonolan and various other events that took place in other books....I was so disapointed with this book. However, I am still glad I bought it and have a complete collection of the series. Let us keep a positive hope that the final book of the series will return us to the Auel writing style that we all love.I agree with everyone else about that ""mother"" song. Oh my gosh..... get rid of it!"
3,You Can Skip this One,"I really wanted to love this book. I treasured the first book of the series. And, I sort of put up with the rest. But, this one was brutal to get through. Jean Auel seems to think that her readers are so dense that we need to read everything five times before we'll remember it. If she had taken out all the excess repeat text, the book would easily be 25% as long. I felt I had to finish the book, since I had devoted so much time to the series, but I was joyous when I was done."
2,I'm disappointed,"I wasn't far into this book when I found myself thinking this wasn't Jean Auel writing it. I was very disappointed, I kept thinking SOMETHING was going to bloom into excitement but every scene fell flat. I really think someone besides Auel wrote this."
2,I was somewhat bored,I am a huge fan of the Auel series. I was disappointed with this sequel. Not only was there a lot of repitition but no controversy or passion that made the other four books excellent.I wanted controversy not a prelude to the 6th book.
3,just OK,"Very detailed, but lagged a bit toward the middle. all in all worth the read, as I give it an average rating."
3,"Amazing detail, above average fiction","I don't know what the haters out there were expecting. Yes, the first book was amazing, and yes, every other book since then has failed to replicate the magic of Clan of the Cave Bear, but the time to be surprised by the change of tone was the second book, when Auel committed fully to a romantic/naturalist plot. Looking over the reviews, people seem to be shocked with each book following the same narrative thread, and exhaustive detail of its predecessors.Each of the first 5 books has kept my attention all the way through (and I don't read a lot of 700-page books). Each one has had amazing detail about the period. The worst I can say is that the authors goes into exhaustive detail about things we already heard, and introduces us to dozens of characters we can't always keep straight.Compared to most new fiction, this is a terrific book. Unfortunately, compared to what we knew Auel can do, it's only above average."
4,Enjoyed it,"I am reading the Earth's Children series this summer and this is book five. The second to last book. There is quite a bit of repetition, and the book could certainly have used some better editing, but I quite enjoyed getting lost in Ayla's world as she finally gets to meet Jondalar's people. One more to go."
1,Bad graphic design.,"The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers."
2,Boring,"I kept waiting to get to the interesting parts, but they never came! This book is 95% character development, and after such a long wait, very disappointing."
1,Rehash,"I waited for 7 years for this book, and am sorely disappointed!I can only hope that this is an introduction to the next in the series."
4,long awaited,We wait sooo very long for new books in this series that sometimes it's almost as though they were reads eons ago. I wanted this book to come out much more quickly than it did. But it literally took me a couple of years to read. I kept putting it down because I just couldn't get into it until after reading at least 100 pages. After that point I ravaged through it. Ms Auel could possibly have condensed this one somewhat. It hasn't deterred me from the next in the series. Whenever that comes along.
2,Tedious,Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book. I've read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others. There are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who's who. The dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book. I'm thinking Ms Auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation.
3,Good story but to wordy.,"I like the series but have found Ms. Auel like many popular authors needs help with trimming before publication. I enjoyed the story, liked the introduction of some protagonist who will obviously play important parts in the future and I look forward to the next book. I have to admit I found the interveiw on NPR helpful in understanding why so much detail. We listened to the book on tape so I can't skip ahead, I didn't find the repetition that unnerving but at times wished the story moved faster."
3,A Bit Too Draggy in Forward Movement and Plot,"Ayla and Jondalar, have just completed a year long journey to arrive at Jondalar's boyhood home, where they want to live together among his people. Ayla is quickly welcomed into his family but has to fit in. With her knowledge of healing and special skills, Alya gains their trust and makes friends. The couple are involved in many experiences and activites that help, although there is little forward movement and character development. But toward the end we get hints of new developments which might be presented in the next book of the series. Let's hope it has all that is lacking in this book.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One - Three"
3,Good set up for the last book,"I read Clan of the Cave bear when I was 13 years old. I have read each book as it has come out. I will be 35 next month. It is a long time to stay with a series. I was afraid that after so long that I would have no more interest, but it caught me right back up again. I am glad that she mentions things from the older books. It would be hard to go back and read them all again, and I had forgotten a lot. It was nice to have my memory jogged again. I look at this book more as a set up for the last one. She has never before left a book so open ended. I think it would be bad for someone to read this without reading the first four in order."
3,Shelters of Stone,"As the last book in this series, I was disappointed in it. All the rest have been wonderful and this was a let down."
1,Shelters of stone,"Jean Auel had no story in mind when she wrote this book. Her first two were excellent but this one and the previous are dribble. If I could, I would get a refund. For sure, I'll never buy another."
2,Yawn,"I LOVED this series, until I got to this book. To tell you how bored I was with this book, it took me almost a year to read it, and I normally can read a book that size in about 3 days. Needless to say, I found the storyline extrememly dry, and the conflicts she had to deal with never amounted to anything. Granted, some of this may come to a head in the next and last book, but for this book, there just wasn't anything to keep my interest. Towards the end of the book I became slightly more intrigued as to what would be happening to the characters, but in a book of this length it shouldn't take that long to get interesting. All in all, I am highly disappointed in this book. I have hopes that the next book will be more stimulating."
2,One more thing I want to add...,"...Egads, what a let-down.I won't repeat the criticisms so eloquently conveyed in the other reviews on this page (99 percent of which I agree with, especially the ones that point out that Auel smuggles in a geography lesson and calls it a story because she couldn't come up with one), but I would like to add one point of my own about why I'm so disappointed:After 4 books of being told how Jondalar's people won't accept a woman who had borne the child of a ""flathead"" and dreading the struggles she would face when she finally arrived, we find these Zelandonocrats to be a California-style culture who receive the news with a shrug and a ""whatever"" attitude, and now it's time for Lamaze class. They'll probably invent the analyst's couch and liposuction before they get around to inventing the wheel.And I waited 12 years for this? Come on, Jean, I know you can do better. Can't you???"
3,Shelters of Stone - Kindle edition,This is another case of a manuscript bieng scanned and run through OCR software and then not bothering with so much as a spell check program. Still a lot of wrong words which will stop you dead in your tracks as you try to figure out what the word should actually be and a lot of not words that you get to puzzle out what ought to be. Not so bad as to be unreadable but annoying in the extreme. What ever happened to publishers actually proofing work before it is released? If they had released a paper edition in this condition they would be getting returns by the case load!
2,A let down,"I anxiously awaited Book 5 for several years after reading the first four, all of which I really enjoyed. The story started off ok (more of the same), but included waaaaay too many recaps. I assume most readers have already read the first four books, and probably didn't enjoy this either. The second half (or two-thirds maybe?) of the book were not good. The story was rushed, missing detail and left me wondering if it was even written by Jean Auel, or if she handed it off to someone else to finish it in time for the release. Overall, not worth it. Clan of the Cave Bears will always be the best."
1,"No stars, No story","Unfortunately Amazon doesn't let you rate a book with zero stars. How so little could happen in so many pages, I'll never know."
2,Having not read the first four books...,"I found this book fairly interesting; for the first half, anyway. After reading a few reviews, my thoughts that this book simply rehashed the previous four were comfirmed. There was too much emphasis on how brilliant and beautiful Ayla was, and how spectacular her control of animals was; I got the idea after the first ten times. My hopes for this book were dashed by the time I finished it. All of the foreshadowing was for naught; tensions were built, and then forgotten about. Discoveries or decisions were hinted at, but never reached. The end of the book seemed rushed; events that were built up to be important were completely left out of the book, as opposed to excessive detail in the beginning (which I am a sucker for). In short: if you read the first four books, or plan to, do not read this one. If you've read this one, you've practically read the first four."
1,Total Disappointment,"I waited 12 years for Ayla, and this book was a total disappointment. Nothing new happened, no new feelings, no new inventions, no new animals, no interesting story. Just a retteling of the previous books and a very expected meeting with the Zeladonii. Even the baby is only barely mentioned. I almost gave up in the middle it was so boring. I read the bad reviews and refused to beleive it, but if I hear bad review on 6 (who knows how long it will take to come out) I'm not going to read it. 1,2,3,4 were amazing. Jean, what happened to the magic?"
2,Glad it's Over,"12 years of anticipation; 3 days of disappointment. Out of 750 pages, about 300 of them may have contained new material, and as others here have noted, even that was less than compelling. However, I wasn't crazy about The Valley of the Horses, either. I skipped almost all the chapters with Jon and Thon (and was thankful that it was split up like that so that I could easily bypass those parts) and was also bored with large sections of Plains of Passage. I appreciate how much research went into Auel's descriptions of flint tool making and of the flora and fauna of the epoch, but honestly... enough already.I think at this point, I'd like to see Ayla assert her otherwordly power and really freak people out, but that's unlikely. She will likely turn out to be the benevolent queen of the Zelandoni with the handsome King Jondalar at her side, and little Princess Jonayla (puh-leez).That said, I'll hope for better things from the last book because I am an eternal optimist."
2,The Great Earth Mother cried at how many trees died to create this drivel,"Like many other reviewers, I have read all of the novels in this series, and have found the quality of the writing (and editing) falls off dramatically after the 3rd book. I slogged through this one only because I wanted to see what advances the plot might take. Very few, indeed. Ayla is perfect; Jondalar is the perfect man; they are both so great, la la la.. The fourth book was painful to read, and should have been subtitled (My thesis on plant life in Neolithic Europe), but this was just awful. I honestly can't say if I care enough to read the ""final"" novel. What else could happen in it, except maybe Jondalar accidentally discovers how to create iron, and Ayla has a dream where Creb teaches her how to begin purposeful cultivation of plants, so that they are the ""Parents of Modern Civilization"" ??? Sorry, Jean, but you lost my interest a thousand pages or so ago. I think that I'll just re-read the first three novels."
2,Shelters of Stone,"After reading and being totally captivated by the first 4 of the series, I waited impatiently for book #5. I am very disappointed in the book, but will continue to have high hopes for the conclusion of the series.My harshest criticism is of the sentence structure throughout the book. The writer did a poor job of portraying ""cave-man style"" conversation or speaking. Two sentences run together, separated by a comma do not depict primitive language or thought, and I do not remember seeing this in Ms. Auel's other books.Also, I resent stumbling over explicit sex in a book which I have chosen for reasons other than hot sex or romance. If you must, one explicit scene would be quite enough, and any other occasion to include romance or intimacy could be handled differently.I could not recommend this book to anyone, but strongly encourage everyone to read The Clan of the Cave Bear, Passage of the Plains, Valley of the Horses, and Mammoth Hunter. They were 100% superb!"
2,Very Disappointing,I waited 6 years for this next book in the series and would have rather waiiting longer for a book with some depth. The book was repetitive and thoughts were not complete. Many opportunities to build the story were just put aside for the next series. Reading the entire book waiting for Ayla to have her baby and then very little is mentioned of the baby once it is born. Her first books were fabulous this was a disappointment!
1,Disappointing!,"I have trouble believing Jean Auel wrote this. Its missing all the story telling qualities of the first 4 books. Its almost a kindergarten version. Ayla was built up as a character with depth in the earlier books and becomes a shallow, power seeking brat. I love re-reading the other books, but this one is on its way to the Goodwill. Can't believe I waited this long for this drivel. yuck."
2,Predicatable,"At least the sex scenes aren't as numerous as in The Mammoth Hunters or Plains of Passage!This is a predicatable sequel with no real eye-openers. It all works out the way you figure it will. There were extremely repetitive parts (if I have to read one more time about how amazing everyone is by Ayla and her animals, I will scream) and some parts were just too easy-not enough conflict.That said, it was a light, interesting read. Wait till it's in paperbackNothing will every beat Clan of the Cave Bear."
1,Where was the plot?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Auel's prior writings and had eagerly looked forward to this novel. I was very disappointed because it was so boring and repetitive. Where was the plot? I kept thinking that Ayla was going to decide to search for her son, Durc or that there would be an encounter with the ""flatheads"" and Ayla would have to act as an interpreter. I wish I could understand why Ms. Auel would tempt her readers with signs that either of these plots would develope but never followed through. I would have given this a two star rating if I hadn't had such high expectations."
2,"Jean, where is the plot?","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00466HQ1A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis book reads as if it were a pastiche of parts of previous books. I came away with the feeling that there was no real plot to this book. My brother, who is a great Auel fan, called me (because I am a writer and have a doctorate in creative writing, and he is an engineer) to ask me what I thought of the book. When I told him that it seemed to lack a plot, he said in a very relieved tone, ""Well, I couldn't find one, but I thought maybe it was just me.""I hope the next book, which I gather is the last and which is already somewhat overdue, is better than this."
3,The story drags on . . .,"We continue to be overwhelmed with ""historical"" information well established in previous volumes. The story line continues but it is weighted down with page after page of repetition. This volume could be half its size and sufficiently treat the topic. It is hoped the 6th and final volume will bring the story of Jondalar and Ayla to a conclusion without so much repetitious filler! Otherwise, a good read."
3,A decent book but a lot of the same old stuff,"So I have read the Earth Children series a few times and I thought that this was a decent addition, but it has nothing on the first two books. I agree with the review that talk about how great it would be if Ayla and Jondalar had mediocre sex for once and if Ayla could become less of a godess. I kept waiting for the people in the book to proclaim Ayla The doni in person and build her a throne of gold. I did enjoy the Summer Meeting and seeing Ayla and Jondalar finally mate. A lot of people go on and on about how wonderful the historial descriptions are but personally I skip over them. I can't spend 20 pages reading about the color of a lake!!! All and all pretty good but not the best. I am looking foward to the 6th book and I hope we finally get to find out about what happens to Durc and the Clan."
3,Sadly disappointing,"I didn't mind the repetition, it's years since I read the previous books. But from what I remember of those books, this was hugely disappointing.While on the positive side it was a substantial read, and doubtless as well researched as the previous novels, there were several irritants. Endless herbal tea. The ludicrous idea of a cro-magnon hippy craft cooperative. Jondalar's Elvis-in-Vegas white leather wedding suit (even Barbie's Ken would have baulked at that). It was also disappointing that we did not get news of Durc, though perhaps that will be in a future novel.Above all, given Ayla's wonderwoman-progress in earlier chapters, I was astonished that she had not invented electric lightbulbs, the internal combustion engine, and nuclear fission by the final page."
3,This is getting old.,"I seriously think there's just not a whole lot more Auel can do with Ayla. I'd personally rather read about what happens to Durc.Ok, Ayla goes back with Jondalar and they get married and have a kid and everyone loves Ayla and ...yeah. We get the point. Happily ever after doesn't make for a good 500 page novel, and the few small conflicts in the story aren't enough to keep me interested. I was a heck of a lot more interested in the crazy half-clan guy than Ayla and Jondalar having sex again. Should have done more character development with him.As is, I'll finish the series because the first 3 books especially were great. The last 2 (and especially this one) not so hot. Oh well, even writers get burnt out I guess, and there was probably that pressure to pump out another Ayla book, inspired or not."
1,Boring,"In ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" we were introduced to Ayla and her foster family.In ""Valley of Horses"", Ayla sets out to find her own people and eventually meets and falls in love with one of them (Jondalar).In ""The Mammoth Hunters"", she comes to live with a larger group of her people for the first time.In ""Plains of Passage"", she accompanies Jondalar on his long journey home to his tribe.SPOILERSAfter they have finally made it to ""The Shelters of Stone"", the story comes to a screeching halt. Nothing even remotely interesting happens in this book. Ayla and Jon get married and finally have their baby. That's it.While the first four volumes in the series admittedly had their lengthy passages, they kept me interested enough to only skip a few pages here and there. But ""The Shelters of Stone"" was so boring that I skip-read 99% of it."
1,21st Century Caveland,"WOW, over 700 pages of tea drinking, 5 minute formal introductions for every personal encounter, 21st century medicine and anatomy lessons, social welfare reform, and Giorgio fashion statements. Also noteworthy to mention are the condo living arrangements, wine and Tupperware parties, oral hygiene practices, and western Christian ceremonies for deaths and weddings. I loved the parts that told the spirits to ""go to the light"" or they ""tied the knot"" and were mated. All of this knowledge of humanity, medicine, art, and civilization and they still can't figure our how babies are made. Go figure!I only finished this book because I waited 12 years for the continued saga. What a waste of time. I skimmed over pages of pure bunk including ceremonial songs and chants. Ayla is of course WONDERFUL. Without her, I guess we would still be swinging from the trees.Wait for the paperback to show up at Goodwill for a dime, then it might be a bargain."
3,interesting when it is not wordy and dull,"In a nutshell - this book desperately needed more diligent editing. The landscape descriptions went on and on and on, over and over and over again. The recollections of Ayla's background were also repeated too frequently. How about just saying, ""they gathered around the fire and shared her story"" nuf said!Should you read it? Sure - if you have read the other books.Will you find yourself skimming a lot? You betcha.Am I going to read the next in the series? Sure, but probably not before it hits the library."
3,"Not the most exciting, yet the story continues.....","While this book lacked the excitement and intrique of the others in the series, it was none-the-less, a welcomed return to the story of Ayla's life. While it was interesting to learn about Jondalar's culture and Ayla's integration into it, I have to say I expected more challenges. There seemed to be the potential for interesting conflicts between the characters, unfortunately they were never really played out. A couple other slightly annoying points... Auel revisited past events (from eariler books) too often and in too much detail. Also, the love scenes were a bit pointless and repetative... not ripe with passion (e.g. The Mammoth Hunters). But hey, aside from my small gripes, I couldn't it put it down! It was nice revisiting the characters I have missed so much over the past few years..."
3,Moderatly disappointed,"As with many others I was anxiously awaiting the release of the new book. For years I had been hearing rumors that Auel had cancer and died, or other crazyness that another book was not being released. Now that I have read the book, and again re-read the series and Shelter's of Stone, I am begining to find the wordiness and repetitivenous tedious. I started to feel that she was cutting and pasting paragraphs from one book to the other. This final book was an OK read, but not the page turner that the other books were. I sincerly hope the next book is a step up."
2,Bored,"I eagerly awaited this book and- flop. It's so old! It's really the plotline from ""Plains of Passage"" and ""Mammoth Hunters"" redone with new characters. Ayla meets lots of people, people are afraid of her inventions and animals, people begin to understand, one person refuses to be friendly with Ayla. Yeah, we know. And the whole thing with her hallucinations being ""special"". If Ayla was a modern woman she would be in constant therapy because of those. EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!And Jondalar. The sex scenes are so...graphic. And he's such a sexaholic! Thonolan seemed so much more in-depth as a character. Jondalar is a pretty boy, the end. It would have worked out as more interesting if Ayla were only average looking like a mortal, for god's sake. I hate Jondalar now. He's horrible. And, I'm sorry, do we need to know of his ""eager member"" or whatever she calls it?Ugh.I'm utterly disappointed."
2,Wait for the Paperback,"If you are a fan of the past 4 volumes, please wait and read the paperback...then you may skip the majority of the book as none of the characters are developed, it is a total rehash of the past four books, and it lacks Jean Auel normal details....it reads more like a Danielle Steele novel than the Earth Children Series I have loved for almost 20 years. There was not nearly enough character development nor excitement...my own imagination has been better than this total waste of time. I adore these books but this was not worth waiting 12 years for...it either needed to be longer or have some characters cut or something! Huge disappointment! Will not be nearly as excited about the next one even though it is the final one..."
3,A book for the fans only!,"It was a good read but a lot slower to get into than her previous books. Things only seem to really have happened in about the last chapter or two. Jean M. Auel seems to have been more interested in detail about the land andd living conditions which i hate to admit made me skip pages at a time just to get to the characters doing anything. She seems to have written it as if she was writing to a brand new audience as she kept on going on and on about what ayla did and why and how she had discovered stuff and why and if, like me, you have read the previous books a couple of times it can be fairly tedious. But all that said, if you are a fan, lets face it - it was worth fighting through the book to find out about the baby and jondalars family (but what a fight!)."
2,Spoiler Alert! Nothing Happens.,"Nothing happens. That's pretty much my review. I waited 30 years to finish this series and discover how Ayla changes the world. I'll just say it is something she claimed from book one so there was no big epithany.In this book, instead of skipping long pages of descriptions of herbs and their uses, I skipped over long pages of descriptions of the paths that they followed on their journey and the pictures in the one too many caves they visited.I was disappointed that there were several plot lines left unfinished: What happened to Ayla's son? I expected them to meet again since there were other Clan characters in the last books. Did her daughter carry Ayla's wisdom and bring even more learning to mankind?It pains me to write this review but my advise is to skip this one."
3,Kindle version disappointing,"I love this series and used to own the hard copy books. I heard the 6th book is coming out in March 2011 so I bought the first 5 books on Kindle so I could re-read them and be ready for the new release. This book, 5th in the series, has so many errors that it distracts from the story. Names spelled wrong, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and sometimes even a sentence or two that make no sense. Luckily since I have read the book in hard copy form I could figure out what it should have said, but it is very, very disappointing to pay money for a book that has so many errors. I can only hope this version is fixed and those of us who bought it get a free upgrade to a corrected book."
1,"oh, sad, sad day","Blah.I don't really know what to say.As someone who has a degree in anthropology, I actually love the detail that has always been heavily present in these books. I *like* the ""boring"" bits. But this was far, far worse than I could ever imagine. Repetition. No, none, zero conflict. Cardboard characters. No plot. The last 40-odd pages sounded more like the Auel we all know and love, but those cannot possibly justify the 700 pages of junk. The only element in that huge section that got me truly excited was Ayla's (inevitable) discovery of the cave that we know today as Lascaux.I was 14 when I finished the series that gave me an inkling about what I wanted to study in college...I'm now 25. And I'm horribly disappointed and heartsick. Jean Auel, what were you thinking??"
3,A Lukewarm Read,"I waited over 10 years (like everyone else) however, the Shelters of Stone was not as good as I anticipated. I have read and re-read all of Ms. Auel's books numerous times. This story went on and on and on. Hundreds of pages passed and only one or two days passed in the book. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. It seemed that the last few pages at the end of the book was where things began to happen (birth of Jonayla and the birth of Whinney's foal). In previous books, Ayla lived in some more interesting cultures than with Jondular's Zelandoni people. Sorry Jean Auel, this book was not worth the wait. Maybe your last one will be better."
2,Just awful,"This really is a dreadful book. It's all setting, no plot. To save you the time, here's what happens: Ayla and hubby arrive at his hometown; Ayla demonstrates all her inventions; Ayla has baby. Yes, sportsfans, that's 750 pages worth! The book is hideously repetitive. If Ayla had shown off her Thread-Puller one more time, or if she enjoyed Pleasures with Jondalar again, I think I would have tossed my cookies. I wish Auel had written instead an anthropological treatise on early human life in southern France; that's what she's really interested in anyway. Definitely pass on this one."
1,741 pages of nothing,"I would have thought it impossible to write a 741 page book and manage to say absolutely nothing. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cover how I feel about having spent good money on this book. I should've waited for the paperback edition, because then, at least, I could've traded it in at my book club. Repetition from the previous books in the series, coupled with reiterating passages from this worthless volume, made me skip several pages in disgust. In short, skip this one... you won't miss anything."
2,Slow moving,"I don't understand why it took Ms. Auel so long to write this book. Almost half of it is either a rehashing of what took place in earlier books or the same thing happening over and over again in this book. The plot also does not advance much. She spends many pages describing the imaginary scenery, which seems beautiful but not necessary to the story. She does introduce many characters, but the character development is limited to only a select few. Indeed, a character introduced early on who appears to be a main protagonist, is then summarily dropped except for a couple of casual mentions 400 pages later. Finally, large spans of time are allowed to proceed without any text. All of a sudden a whole season goes by with only 50 or so pages of text. The book did progress the story, but the same amount of progression could have been done in 100 pages. It feels as if this book was just filler till the next one."
3,"Godd, but could have been better","It took me 3 days to read it, as much as I liked the first 4 books I to was disapointed. All those name repetition. Jean could have just be that they all introduce themselve without thos names. and all those pages of describing the area. I to scipped pages. the ending left me hangging and wanting more. I would have like more action between characters. It left me wondering about Lanoga and lanidar. What about Marona, Laranar and Brukeval? And what is the deal with the Zelandonia? Do they end up trading with the Clan? I mean, there ae too many loose ends. She could have don better. It seems another book may be on the way but I just hope is better.I gave it a 3 beause Im a big fan. Jean if you are reading this ""PLEASE STOP THE REPETITION AND ALL THOSE DESCRIPTIONS PLEASE"""
4,And now for the rest of the story...,"After finishing ""Plains of Passage"" years ago, I closed the book thinking that there was so much more I wanted to know. Frankly, I had the same impression after finishing ""Shelters of Stone"". This is not necessarily a criticism, but a caution for those people who like everything tied up neatly at the end of a book.It almost seems that Jean Auel may have written two books worth of material, and just broke this off at a convienent stopping point. There is still more of the story to be told, and I'm looking forward to it. The characters are still compelling and the description of prehistoric living is interesting."
3,JUST OK,"I found this fifth book in the Earth Children series much too long and repetitious. I was getting pretty sick of hearing how Ayla found and trained her horses and her wolf......I found the previous four books of this series much more interesting. However, I plan to read Miss Auel's next book, but I sure hope it does not take her twelve years to write it like it did this one. I'm a senior citizen and cannot afford to wait too long......Miss Auel did much research about the people who lived 30,000 years ago in the limestone caves of this story..... Ayla and Jondalar complete their long journey to arrive at the home of Jondalar's people who are called Zalondonii.......The tame horses and wolf are a wonder to the Zalondonii as their limestone caves, artifacts, and customs are to Ayla. Most of Jondalar's people accept Ayla, but some do not......This book ends with the main characters starting a family of their own.....Hope the next book follows soon."
2,Would have made a good short story,"As usual Ms Auel repeats herself constantly, telling you the same thing she went through a few chapters ago. Again we hear of his blue eyes and her accent on almost every page. Ayla's history is repeated over and over again. ... The average reader will not remember that this is 99% pure fantasy and 1% fact on the artifacts. Perhaps Ms Auel's next book should be Science Fiction where her mix of customs and language would not be so jarring. Put it on another planet and it might be more digestable."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I too read all of Jean M. Auels' previous novels and while I LOVED, LOVED The Clan of the Cave Bear each successive book went downhill. However, I wasn't quite prepared for the lengthy, wordy, descriptive (ad nauseum) story in her latest effort. I agree her research is intense and obviously feels very strongly about it but I wanted to read this book for a fun summer read, not a lecture on prehistoric man/woman. I also agree with a previous review, the characters are very one dimensional - the good people are good and the bad people are bad. I am loathe to put a book down once I start it, however I was tempted many times with this one. Now that I have finally finished it, I have no plans to read any future installments."
1,Where was the editor???????,"I kept doggedly reading, hoping to return to the storyteller I had found in the first 4 books. Never happened. Was there an editor? Ayla's story deserves to be told without endless repetition of descriptions of scenery, introductions to characters that are never developed, and story lines that are started and then dropped without any explanation. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Had to put it down,"I imagine it is not fair of me to review a book I had no desire to continue with... And it is so rare for me NOT to labor on with a book searching for whatever is redeeming within its bindings...but in this case, I agree completely with the reviewer missingtexas. The writing style is monotonous, I could care less about the characters, and the larger themes and ""issues"" e.g. racial discrimination of ""flatheads"" as reflection of our current societies ills was so contrived. Insultingly simple, irretrievably dull!"
3,An acceptable recovery.,"I am a fan of Jean Auel's books, and remember waiting for plains of Passage to be released. If I remember right, it felt like years. I suspect that several people, like myself, were dissapointed a little in the change in writing style, and more importantly, the lack of depth that the book seemed to have.Here, Jean Auel makes a recovery. I was unnerved dropping a hard-cover price on this book after being so dissapointed with the last one, but fortunately I was not dissapointed this time. It is a nice read, full of detail, and fortunately Ayla lost that vapid ignorance spell she seemed to pick up in the earlier book. There seems to be a bit of an issue finding the 'plot', per se, but as the whole series seems to have wholly drifted into the romance genre that is not surprising. Fortunately, it is not laid on unbearably thick in this novel."
1,I waited so long....,"I bought the whole series (The Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters, Plains of Passage, The Shelters of Stone) so I could relive the excitement I felt when I first read them years ago. By the time I finished the Plains of Passage, I was getting bored with the repetition. Then I started Shelters and was so disappointed I wanted to scream, it was worse! Much worse! How many times do we have to hear the Iza taught Ayla to wash after sex? This book was a disappointment. I hope Ms. Auel doesn't rely on previous material in the final book of the series to fill in the space between the covers!"
2,I've been had!!!,"I am only half way through, and probably will not finish!!This is a big disapointment. Ms Auel seems to tout the French aspect of this book by the wine, the cusine, the erotic sex and the advanced vocabulary!!The ploy of waiting so long to publish this book has made her a LOT of money. Personally I would like a refund!!"
1,Shelters of Stone,"After waiting 11 years I was really disappointed. It seemed that everytime someone new was introduced, it took three paragraphs to tell who they were. Maybe Jean Auel will have another book out in about 20 years and by then I won't be around to read it. A very drawn out tale, not what I had expected."
1,very disappointing!,This book is equivalent to my 6th grader's book report. I am extremely disappointed that Ms Auel can not call it quits.Don't waste time reading the jacket cover!
2,Fresh Voices Needed!,"After a decade, both Jean Auel and Robert Waller produced follow-ups to previous hits. I read both and wished I had not wasted my time nor money."
1,"Agree with ""Just A Reader""","The author is obsessed with her exploration of the historic sights and forces descriptions of minutiae on us that add nothing to the story; in fact, they take the place of character development and divert the story line.As much as I liked the first three in the series, I put this one down for good just over half through. I would give NO stars if the rating system allowed that."
1,It was awful!!!,"I'm sorry to say, and sorry to use this language, but it sucked. Pretty much what other reivewers said is true. What a terrible disappointement. I read the first one over 20 years ago, and wanted and waited for this one. What a let down. What a ripoff!"
1,Disappointing...,... that's the most appropriate word to describe how I feel about this long awaited book.
1,Great Expectations - but,"I couldn't bring myself to get past the first hundred pages. The writing is repetitive and oversimplified. I felt like I was reading a grown up ""Dick and Jane"". I won't go to see movies like ""Dumb and Dumber"" and I don't read novels written like The Shelters of Stone.I loved Clan of the Cave Bear...but this...Oh no, Mr. Bill!"
2,Throbbing manhoods and geology lessons,"After a long wait, Shelters of Stone is a disappointment. I wait and wait for a plot to develop, but most of the words involve Jondalar's throbbing manhood (O spare me), Ayla's oral fixation on the said manhood, lengthy geological lectures, rambling landscape narratives, the same-old-same-old surprises that surprise everyone who meets this surprising woman, the repetition of facts (as if either the author forgot she mentioned things two pages earlier, or she believes the reader has forgotten), those rotten spear throwers appearing fifteen times (with people always being surprised), Ayla developing society and modern technology single-handedly (in the next volume does she invent Glad Wrap and the TCP-IP protocol?), and the poor Wolf and horses who (of course) surprise people and fill them with wonder every time they appear. Really, Jean: is there anything in this fat tome that has not already appeared a dozen times in the previous volumes?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Like everyone else, I waited for tweleve years for this book.. and I ran out and bought it as soon as I could.I want my money and my nine hours back.The characters are bland. There was no plot, no twists, and just about nothing happening that wasn't either easy to foresee or a rehash of books one through four.Wait till book six comes out, then pick this one up in paperback and skim it. Trust me, I'm trying to save you the anguish of characters you can't get into, events that are just plain silly, and the endless retelling of events that you don't need to be told about if you bothered to read the rest of the series."
1,Sequel Fatigue,"It was like seeing ""The Phantom Menace""--you wanted to like it, you tried to like it, but halfway through you realize you just want to finish it because you've waited so long for it. Nothing really compelling here. It feels like an in-between story, a filler, except it's 700 pages long! Unlike the previous books, which would keep me up till the wee hours (even with a full days work the next day) immersed in another place, another time, this one can be read with one eye on the TV and you won't miss much.It's too bad because so many of us have anticipated this book with good feelings for so long and would have been generous in our reviews had we been given a little more than the bone thrown at us."
3,It's interesting novel,"Since I've read all of Auel's books back to back this winter, I did find this novel rather repetitive ~~ I already know what has happened to Ayla in the past ~~ and I was rather disappointed that this book wasn't flushed out like her other novels. I love reading about Ayla and Jondular ~~ I love reading about the craftwork, the hunting, and how they survive in prehistoric times but there wasn't much new in this novel and she left it hanging ~~ so I am assuming that there will be a sixth book in the series.If you're interested in prehistoric times, start with the Clan of the Cave Bear, The Valley of Horses, and Mammoth Hunters ~~ they are the best novels in the series. Also, they're not so focused on the sexual aspect of Ayla's life, like her two last novels (including this one). If you want to read more on romance, this book is for you!It's an ok novel ~~ not the greatest and not the best. I haven't given up on Auel yet ~~ I am anxiously waiting for the next one!3-12-04"
1,Why can't Jean's publisher help out?,"I enjoyed every one of Jean Auel's books until now. This book was all set up and NO plot. Even though some possible action was hinted at throughout the book, NOTHING happened. Hint for her next book: use Auel's detail of prehistoric life and character set-up, then hire a ghost writer to weave a PLOT into the book."
2,Disappointed,"I looked forward to another ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" or ""The Mammoth Hunters."" Boy, was I disappointed. Not much story or action here. This book is mostly a lesson in archeology and anthropology. Not entertaining. Boring. Boring. Boring. I think the author has lost her muse and gone over to teaching.Bored Reader"
1,Couldn't put the other 4 down...can't pick this one up...,"Talk about mind-numbing drivel, I could have waited another 10 years for this one. Does little to further the story and is mostly a cliff notes summary of the last 4 books. But for your hard earned cash you'll at least get to read over 100 pages describing the appearance of cave/rock formations...I've read college textbooks that were more entertaining...It's taken me several months but out of respect for Auel's earlier books I've almost managed to finish this one...It does make a great paperweight though..."
3,Be prepared for the change in Ayla's voice,"I enjoyed reading Clan of the Cave Bear about 25 years ago. I've been enjoying the series again on audio. Everything went well until I reached this book, which picks up minutes after the 3rd book ended. Somehow in those few minutes, Ayla acquired a Transylvanian accent. Her voice has deepened and she sounds like Elvira. I'm not sure why this change in direction was chosen, but it is very annoying and off putting. I felt like I didn't know the character any longer. Only now, in the last chapter of this epic novel am I getting used to her new voice.I would have expected a speech impediment, maybe, but an accent? She came from people who didn't speak...where on earth would she have gained an accent, and why only add it now?"
1,Kindle edition full of errors,"Every page of this Kindle book contains multiple errors: punctuation, formatting, spelling. It's distracting and very disappointing. I can't even enjoy reading it."
2,Just OK,I was very excited to see this book finally out and bought it immediately. I had become a fan after reading the first book and although some of the ones that followed were less well written I had great hopes for this one. I was disappointed. I kept waiting for something to happen that never did. No problems were overcome nor dangers survived. Boring. I got to the point where if I read one more line about how great Ayla is I thought I'd choke. About the best thing I can say is it's nice she finally has what she's always wanted. Perhaps the next and last book will be better but I'm not holding my breath.
2,The Shelters of Stone,"I have waited for a very long time for this book and when I finally read it I was very disappointed. The book continues on and on about the scenery. I found myself just quickly glancing over many pages and was bored with alot of the book. I was really looking forward to the same type of book Jean had written in the past,I couldn't put those books down. I was very disappointed with this book. If it would of been the first of Jean's series I would never have read another one."
2,This one is a bore,"Since my son bought me Plains of Passage for a birthday present (well maybe it was a Christmas present) I loved this series. Bored? Nothing to read? Reread one of the Earth's children books. But this thing is a drag. No point to it, plots are developed but never resolved .. ah it is just turgid."
2,I waited 10 years for THIS?!,"Auel apparently grew bored and uninspired with her characters and story, because she literally cut and pasted pages and pages of descriptions and events from previous books into this book. The repeating of all names and ties and putting in lyrics to silly, long songs was not a creative way to take up space -- she should have made this book shorter. This effort was a major disappointment. The author gives the impression that this book was done purely for the profit margin, not the integrity of the story.As for the story line itself, it is ok -- but never finishes anything like the contest of wills between Ayla and Marona, or the drunk, or the 'mixed-spirits' guy...and that fact that Ayla is practically forced into their preisthood after repeatedly saying no, and in the past not liking the spiritual stuff, is really just stupid and out of character for her.While I hope it doesn't take 10 years for the last one, I won't be rushing to buy it in hardcover either."
2,kinda let down,"I have waited a long time for this book. I loved her other EC books. This one is almost boring and repetative. When I am reading a page it feels like I just read the same page 10 pages ago. Or so much description is layed out for the scenery, the story seems lost. I think this book could have been written in half as many pages. I understand these places are real, but I almst feel like I am getting a geography lesson. I did enjoy knowing what happened to Ayla and Jondalar, but I did not not enjoy this book as much as the other EC books."
2,There's really no plot,"I, like most of the posters here, really loved Jean Auel's earlier novels. Even the slower... ones like Valley of the Horses or the Mammoth Hunters had a regular plot and exciting passages, along side Auel's continous and constant pre-historic lore. (And I thought Plains of Passage was just downright thrilling)But the problem is that this book has almost no plot. Like many people noted the book is one big continous loop. Many of the conversations between the characters were better left up to the fan's imagination. (Such as the meeting between Ayla and Marona). Even Ayla, at some point in the novel notes a repetion from a previous novel (""Are we going to have to give him a firestore like Frebec?"").One would have liked to see more conflict. It didn't have to be this bland.There is one good thing about this novel is that it seems to be setting up (one would hope) a more exciting sequel, and Auel has promised that it will come out relatively soon."
3,Predictable,"We waited 12 years for this? It's not ""plodding"" like Plains of Passage, but with a few exceptions, not exciting at all - totally predictable. I had high hopes early in the book, especially when Marona pulled her little trick, but after that, things just settled back down again and never seemed to pick up - I didn't even get worked up when Ayla had the baby. In my opinion, 12 years without a major novel has dulled Jean Auels' edge - that's the only explanation I can come up with (but her research is still meticulous). There were plently of opportunities to get our blood pumping, but nothing developed from those opportunities. I could give an outline of the whole story in one page - and any devoted ""Clan"" fan could fill in the blanks. Sorry Jean - I love the series, but am disappointed with this book, especially after waiting so long. Sure hope you're planning some fireworks for #6!"
2,should have been a 100 page novel,"The book had too much ""padding"" in my opinion and would have made a good shorter book. Also, for those of us following the ""earth children"" series I found that the book was really more concerned with the thoughts and feelings of other characters (notably Zolena) rather than Ayla. I even thought that some of Ayla's behaviour was out of character - she hardly ever took a lead role in the book and was too subordinate to Zolena - she should have been much more of an equal (since actually Ayla was much more advanced) despite her natural modesty."
2,next one needs to be much better,"This is not the worst book that I have ever read, but it takes a close second. The dialog is dry and uninteresting, the settings don't change, and there aren't enough descriptions of the area. The sense of looking for something is missing, which is what made the first four books so good. But the worst part of the entire book are the long, drawn-out love scenes. I was one of the many people who were waiting at the door of the book store for our reserved copies. If you havn't bought it yet, wait for the paperback."
1,Shelters of Stone,I have read all of Jean Auel's books and this was the most poorly written one of them all. I felt I was plowing through words trying to find the story. That is not how one feels when reading a well written book. Most of the book was taken up with telling Jondalars people all the things they knew. Not very interesting. I feel her writing style has changed very much from her other books.
2,Where's the beef?,"Somewhere along the way, Jean Auel forgot that a novel is supposed to have a story. The latest installment in the Earth's Children's Series drags along on ""Ayla and Jondalar get married and have a baby,"" surrounded by hundreds of pages of obviously well-researched but often tedious details more suited to a taped narration in a natural history museum.Characterization is often reduced to caricature. Ayla, the prehistoric superwoman, is the first human being to domesticate animals and to discover the fire-starting properties of iron pyrite. Ludicrously, she also becomes the first to realize that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse.In short, this is not a novel; it's a National Geographic special."
1,"Greed One, Fans Zero","I can't add much to the other negative reviews, except to say that if Ms. Auel couldn't give her thousands of faithful fans an effort worthy of the previous books, she should have just let it (and us) go. If Jean Auel actually wrote this, then something is very, very wrong with her. Shame on her editor(s) and the publisher of this truly atrocious book, for wasting the money and, what's worse, the time of Ms. Auel's fans. I guess what with the ready made market, greed got the better of everyone involved. Well, they got my money this time. I hope they put it in the bank, because they won't get it again."
2,News about the author,"For those of you who are not aware of it, the original author of this series passed away some years ago. Someone else took over writing the next several books, I'm not sure how many, maybe 2. I don't remember if it is someone from the family who took over the writing or someone else. Anyway, the books written by someone else are good, but they lack Jean Auel's distinctive way of writing. Just thought I would give a little perspective on this!"
2,Enough already?,"Only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for Ayla to invent The Wheel (and is anyone else as irritated as I am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex?) Seriously, I can guess why Auel is constantly rehashing material from earlier books--to hide the lack of a story or interesting new characters--and I had particularly looked forward to meeting Zelandoni, the previous great love of Jondalar's life. For an entertaining and far quicker read on the subject of Stone Age life, read Joan Wolf's trilogy(Daughter of the Red Deer, The Horsemasters, The Reindeer Hunters). I've recently reread the book, and while still giving only two stars, I must say that it reads faster the second time around--maybe because of knowing which segments to skip over altogether!"
1,The editor that passed on this book should retire!,"It's easy to recommend CLAN of the CAVE BEAR. However, J.A.'s follow ups were a bit disappointing and wading through this repetitious tome is a total time waste."
1,Shelters of Stone,"No story line, no plot, nothing new. Jean Auel should have combined books 4, 5 and 6 and saved all the repetitive filler. We got it the first three times. Very poor writing, very boring book, but that's free enterprise. We didn't have to grab the hook when it was offered. That's my opinion."
2,The Shelters of Stone,"After waiting 12 years for this book to come out ( I had given up hope) I was some what disapointed. I have come to expect Alya to be an independant and resoureful woman. It is as if she has just settled into the routine of daily life. Mostly the book covered what had been already written. Some of the pages were tedious and hard to keep up with. It took me about 3 days to read The Mammoth Hunters, I just couldn't stop reading. This one has left me with a bad taste. If I have to wait another 12 years to continue the saga I will be hard pressed to pay the price for the hard cover edition, and will wait till I can check it out or paperback."
3,A little disappointed,"Not up Jean's par. Too much repetition. Not enough plot. Too predictable. I really hope the next book is back to the level or her earlier works. And I hope it doesn't take another decade. Still an enjoyable read and a must for those following the series, but if this was the first and not the fifth book I don't know if I'd be so anxious for the next one."
2,This book had no point!,"Up to this point, I had looked forward to Jean Auel's books. However, after reading her latested installment I was very disappointed. Yes, she has always been wordy but it seemed the whole book was that way. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was wondering where it was going and I found out at the end. NOWHERE!! What a waste of time and money. This was one of those books that you finish and then say to yourself ""Is THAT it?""..."
2,600 unnecessary pages.,"While I am a BIG fan of the 'Earth's Children series and bought every volume, I was extremely disappointed in the final book 'Shelters of Stone'. Remove all the flowery scene descriptions and constant recapping of the previous 4 volumes and the book would have been no more than 100 pages. What a let down after such an incredible journey. I doubt a 6th volume would fill the void left by this blunder."
1,VERY disappointing,"This book is far too overdue - I find I've lost interest in the entire series. After reading this enormous (too big) book with its excess of overdone sex, I can assure you I won't be buying/reading the next one! Too much, too much, too much EVERYTHING!!!"
3,"Good, but I'm glad I waited for the paperback","I read with earnest the first four books in the Earth's Children series and looked forward to following Ayla and Jondalar through the fifth. I was disappointed, however, at the numerous repetitions. Many scenes were repeated, nearly word for word, without purpose. Had the scenes had some sort of significance, or added emphasis to the plot, it would have been different; I wonder if, while writing, Ms. Auel just repeated herself so the book's heft would compare with that of the others.Overall, I enjoyed the story and found the plot satisfying. I am happy, however, that I waited to purchase the paperback."
2,I agree with the real critiques,"Like you who have read both the book and the ""professional"" critiques, I felt guilty for disliking this latest in the sequel with such intensity. But then I relaxed when I read the reviews of the average fan of Auel's - I'm normal after all. This book was so dissappointing. I found myself reading each new page just hoping that she would return to the fresh and origianl style of historical fiction that I had grown to long for. But the book never delivered. I'm waiting for her next book. Even the greatest of athletes strike out once in a while and I'm certain that her next work will be a home run. If you've never read the first four books don't bother. Read this one and you'll know everything you needed to know about the first four. Then read the first four and realize how great the series really is. For those of us who have loved the first four - we became tired of all the italicized repaeats."
3,Loaded Backstory,"Jean M. Auel's much anticipated THE SHELTERS OF STONE has Jondalar and Ayla ending their journey to his home and planning their wedding. Each treasure they share with his people is burdened with extensive details from previous books which makes for either much skipping or slow going for the reader.Buried in the tome are snips of insight and discovery that have entralled readers of past volumes. Ms. Auel deserves a good editor to cut the line between supporting detail and leading fill.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
1,Progression,As the series progresses they become more and more repetitive to the point that there appears to be absolutely nothing new to to reveal for Earth's Children. I could not even finish it as a storyline or plot was never really developed.
3,I guess it was ok,"I looked forward to the release of this book and was sorely disappointed. I loved the other ones so much that I reread them at least every few years. This book seemed different. The characters seemed duller and less interesting. I found myself skipping huge blocks ... even pages and pages at a time ... looking for something and never quite finding it. Too much time was spent retelling the happenings from the previous books. I believe this book was geared more towards a fresh new audience that had not read the previous books. Hopefully, the next one will come out sooner and have more exciting things happening to my beloved Ayla."
1,"Ayla, the World's First Feminist","First, I've read all the books in the series and enjoyed them. Okay ""Plains of Passage"" was a boring read but not too bad. In ""The Shelters of Stone"" Jean Auel makes Ayla out to be some kind of super-woman, who invented open heart surgery to figuring out ""where babies come from.""The promblem? It's gone too far. I think the long wait between books as made me lose interest. Either that or Ms. Auel can't write Ayla anymore. She lost her momentum. At the beginning it was fun to see Ayla invent all this stuff, but the fun is gone. I suppose this can happen with a series or a series of books with one character in the center. (I just hope Patricia Cornwell can keep Kay Scarpetta fresh for a long time yet.)What I will say in Auel's favor, her research is amazing. The lady does her homework and it shows.For newcomers to the series, start with ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" and follow in order, quickly. That way you'll enjoy it."
1,Did they forget to edit this book?,I loved the other two books in this series and was truly looking forward to this book - I couldnt be more disappointed. I'm an advid reader - and this book was painful at times to read. Normally I would of just stopped - but out of curosity and loyality I finished it. This story could of been told in half the pages. Some background and info is nice - but the detail was long winded and more often that not - repetitive. I swear I read the same descriptive paragraphs more than once. I got the description of the cave the first time - didnt need it over and over again.My greatest urge while reading this book was to get out a red marker and start crossing out passages. So if you dont mind scanning through the extra verbage to get to the meat of the story this is okay and minus a couple hundred pages it would of been great - oh well. Cant recommend it.
4,Parts read like romance novels of today,"I loved all the Earth's Children books but was so disappointed to read loves scenes (over and over) in ""Stone"" that read like today's romance novels.Jean Auel goes to great lengths to give the reader a feel for life 30,000 ago. I am just somewhat disappointed with the graphic love details."
2,Only for serious fans of the series,"After putting her fans on hold for several years, Jean Auel's The Shelters of Stone delivered a relatively disappointing product. Again, Auel clearly demonstrates that she has researched the daily lives of early man in stunning detail. However, this latest book does not deliver anything new or interesting to the reader. Ayla, her proto-feminist(?) protagonist, does exactly what she has done in previous novels: be kind to children and old people, heal furry critters, question religious, cultural, & scientific norms, and make passionate love with her man.I can only assume the book is a bridge into the final chapter of the life of Ayla which will in all likelihood bring together her people with those of the Clan. Save your dollars and get this one from the library."
1,WOULD THE REAL JEAN AUEL STAND UP,"Would the real Jean Auel stand up. This book,THE SHELTERS OF STONE, seems like the author had three people read the other books in this series and then had them each pen the chapters. It is a great drop below her other books. No real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book. And with the new problems introduced in this book, the reader is left with a sense of loss. No closure to Ayla's pain about Durc. No meeting among the Clan and the Zelandonii. Ayla has to be able to strut her stuff for the good of her new people."
5,Great book-well worth the wait!,"Beautifuly written! I was quite suprised when i heard that one of my favorite authors had picked up her pen again after such a long wait. But it was worth it! I was once more transported to the iceage where Ayla and her soon to be mate Jondelar conclude their long journey and arrive at Jondelars home at the Zelandoni Caves. The amount of detail and accuracy she puts into her work is astounding. I expecially liked Aylas experiences in the beautiful holy caves where she goes on a spirituel journey. It was an extremely pleasurable experience to read this wonderfully crafted novel, and it is one that i plan to repeat often. I cannot wait until Auel comes out with the conclusion to this spectacular series. Hopefully this one will not take her nearly as long to write and publish."
5,Ties up loose ends,"I gave it five stars because I liked it. I considered giving it four stars because I don't think this book will hold much for a person who hasn't read the previous books in the series. It ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures, but it doesn't carry a lot of excitement of its own. Obstacles are too easily overcome. This book works well as a step in a larger series, but I don't think it could stand on its own."
3,Disappointed,"The book was ok, there was writing on one of the pages, but that was not too bad. I was really disappointed to find out that there was no cover for the book. All of my books that I have bought here at Amazon have come with the beautiful cover. But this one did not."
4,"Kind of good, kind of bad","I liked the book, but little things in it were annoying. I swear it probably talked about how different people noticed Ayla's accent a million times! There were simaler repitions that bugged me too; I could probably even write a 700 page book about them. Overall, I still liked the storyline and characters. I also thought it was an improvement over the last book which I found boring and tedious. (I didn't read all of it, I just skipped over the boring stuff.) Anyway, I hope Auel didn't spend the entire 12 years on the book because from the other reviews I read it looks like people didn't think much of it."
3,A lot of rehashing....,"This is almost a retelling of 'The Mammoth Hunters' from the POV of Jondalar's tribe. While there are some new twists (the bitchy ex, the town drunk), for the most part I was a little bored by this book. Even 'The Plains of Passage' had more plot than this book! I think that Auel's storytelling has become more mass-market and less individual throughout the course of this series...the first three books were wonderful, the fourth a bit dry and pedantic but with this one she doesn't even seem particularly interested in her subject. Hopefully, her sixth book will be better-if there is one."
1,Save your money,"If you are looking for well-developed characters, an interesting storyline and fascinating background information - look elsewhere. I have struggled through 1/2 of this book and thus far have found it to be little more than tedious scenic descriptions (which run on for page after page) peppered with sexual encounters (which are so poorly written as to be laughable). I am returning this book to the library unfinished because I cannot bear to read one more page and am quite relieved that I did not waste money on this drivel. Unless you honestly enjoy books which use phrases like ""tumescent manhood"" and ""pulsating nodule,"" I would strongly suggest you avoid this book like the plague."
1,The Shelters of Stone,"I was so disappointed in this book that were supposed to be the last in the series. The endless repetition was enough to drive me insane. How could this book ever have been published? Was it only for the sake of money that could be made out of the sale of this book, because everyone who followed the series was waiting in anticipation for it. I still can't believe a person who wrote Clan of the Cave Bears, Valley of the Horses etc, could give her readers something like this......????"
2,Down hill slide,"The Clan of the Cave Bear was a remarkable beginning to Auel's series. The Valley of Horses continued with Ayla's struggle to survive, ending with finally meeting one of the Others. The Mammoth Hunters starts turning into prehistoric soap opera, introducing another man to compete for Ayla's affection, while Jondular mopes around. The slide started there. The Plains of Passage was nothing more than traveling and sex scenes. Now we have the Shelters of Stone. I guess I thought that after the Plains, Auel took 12 years to bring back some drama and plot, and improve the series. Turns out she must have had writer's block, and the publisher obviously forced her to get something, anything, worked into a manuscript. The editor did a terrible job. This book should have been 400 pages instead of 750. I had anticipated this book, but now I think it's only worth reading out of curiosity and as a bridge to the next and final story, which I will probably be too old and decrepit to read."
2,Disappointing,"I have been an avid reader of Jean Auel's Earth Children Series for some time. I anxiously purchased this book as soon as it came out - ...this book does not live up to the first four of the series. It is so different that I have even told people that half the time it reads as if someone else wrote it. Whereas the other four books are full adventure, interesting plots, and passion, this book has none of any of those things. I thought even the story was lacking in this book: predictable, dull, and flat. If it was my first introduction to the series, I wouldn't have read half the book.Most of the book painfully reviews past events, and repeats the same things several times. Save your money - don't buy this book. You will do better to stop after Plains of Passage - you will be happier with series then."
3,"Rather disappointing, lacking the depth of the others","After waiting so long for this book, I was disappointed on the reuse of previous information from the other books. Yes, they needed to recount their adventures but it seemed to make up the majority of the book. The only really key new theme was the relationship between Ayla and the Zelandonia and even that wasn't in the depth and detail that situations in previous books were presented. I found this book rather ""fluffy"" compared to the others and don't think Ms Auel was really into writing it. Furthermore, it ending with such an obvious ""wait for the next one"" it didn't seem complete. I felt each previous book told its own complete story even though it led you to expect another."
3,"Well, what ahopens next??","I have to agree with some of the reviews of this book, BUT I LOVE this character and so I will avidly read ANYTHING or any book about her...Ayla IS woman...but I DID find the book tedious at times with all the long introductions of people and all their titles and I actually don't care all that much about the socal order of the Zelandoni People........BUT will grab the next book as soon as it becomes available...Ayala is an old friend and I will stick with her to the very bitter end, to the death of Whinney and Wolf and perhaps even Jondular or Ayala herself...is she EVER going to be reunited with Durc??If I can say antying about this book, I WILL say that I am glad that I did not read this one first and so have read them all in the order in which they were written. This was NOT the best..."
2,Should be called The Descriptions of Stones,"This MIGHT have been an OK book if it had been half the length! Way way way too many descriptions of the rivers, the shores, the stones, the caves etc etc etc. It reads like a **very boring** geological textbook half the time! Hardly what you would call page-turning fiction! We all know that Ms. Auel has done extensive research for these novels, but I really don't want to be reminded of that on every page. Fiction is about plot, character development; not tedious drivel describing the physical landscape.Also, the book is very badly edited. There are so many repetitious parts--how many times does Joharran have to ask Jondalar if he'll teach them how to use and make the spear-throwers!??! Come on!Once again, an author got lazy and is riding on the coattails of her previous success. I won't bother reading any more of Jean Auel."
1,Get it from the library for FREE,"So glad I didn't waste money in buying this book when the library had it for free. But still, I felt myself bored in reading it and wishing something, ANYthing interesting would happen. It was built up to look as if Marona or Brukeval would cause discord in Ayla's perfect world, but alas, nothing ever came of that. And each time Ayla met someone new I would just cringe knowing that ALL the titles were going to be repeated yet AGAIN. How tiresome did THAT become?! At least it wasn't AS repetitive as The Mammoth Hunters, but I still could have done without reading about all of Ayla's past in detail, over and over and over. And in this book, just as in the other books since Clan of the Cave Bear I was hoping Ayla would go back to the Clan to see Durc and to truly bring Broud down a notch or two, but didn't happen in this book either. This book was a big Y-A-W-N."
2,A Good Introduction to Book 6?,"The repetition of the earlier books is justified for those who haven't read them, or don't remember what they read 12 years ago. The repetition within the book is not; nor are the ad nauseum descriptions of rocks, plants, hills, valleys, etc. Are the number of words in the book used in calculating what Jean Auel was paid? probably, and she knew it. The story line, while stretched out and left hanging, was good. The presentation of the social lives, and struggles of the people Ayla is to live with is interesting, if not exciting. But, the whole thing could have been comfortably compressed into a couple hundred pages as the first few chapters of something a lot better...like what we all hope book 6 will give us."
2,Ayla is Tina Turner?,"Wow, may I just say this: This series has been hard enough to get through (I got the audiobooks free from a friend), but now it's intolerable. Remember how in the early 90's Tina Turner all of a sudden had this weird brit/european accent? For no apparent reason? Well, the same reader has done books 2-5, and now- in book 5, Ayla has this weird accent. She rolls her r sounds and has this broken language deal going on. Whatever. Like the storylines aren't lame enough, now it sounds awful, too.I'm so tired of their sex life by now, Ayla certainly must be, too. Of course, she is the queen of the instant orgasm, so maybe not. Lucky girl, I guess. Anyway, that's my review- no need to review the story because it's the same as all the others. But to change the entire speech and cadence of the main character's voice is just ridiculous. What crap."
1,Cave people soap opera,"I have never seen so much padding in a book, ever. It is worse than General Hospital that my mother watched for so many years. My feeling is that chapters were given to hired writers while Jean Auel was on vacation and the writers weren't very good. I think Jean's readers deserve something much better.Carol"
2,This book was a bit too redundant.,"I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on ""how amazing"" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in ""Clan of the Cave Bear,"" and ""Valley of Horses."" (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!"
2,Shelters of Stone,This book is boring - the previous were exciting.This one reminds me of Stephen King and his repetitive writing(all in the same book).Could have been only half as many pages and more interesting.
1,Hated It!,"I've read all of Ms. Auel's novels, and have loved every one...until now. I kept waiting for this to get better, and I kept paging through, and it never got better. The story was boring, and insulting in it's simplicity (I felt as if I was reading an archeological textbook for 4th graders), there was no excitement as was the case in other books, and the ending was ridiculous. I actually paged through past the last paragraph, thinking that I was missing part of the book. Talk about dropping off in the middle of nowhere. The only saving grace about the ending was just that - it was the ending! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. It's a waste of [money]."
2,Long wait... Too long,"I waited, like everyone else, for the next installment in this series and didn't hold off until a sale or for a discount.I should have.Either Ms. Auel fired her editor or, like too many of her experts, he died during her extended hiatus.How many times must we be told about Ayla using the night-basket because she had to urinate more often due to her pregnancy? How many times did we need reminded that Ayla was frightened to become a Zeladoni? Other examples of this repetitive writing are numerous. The book could have been cut by 15% and not suffered - probably improved.I hope the sixth book is better edited and Ms. Auel tightens her craft. Yes, I will buy the next one and hope for the best."
5,"E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's best book!","There are some that swear by the Lensman series, others by the Skylark series, but personally, I go for the single books like Subspace Explorers.Unlike many of E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's books, this book actually has women as capable, thinking (and of course, loving) beings. It even contains references to sex! The story line is great, although of course fantastical, and altogether a rollicking read."
4,Great French Flick,"There are two kinds of french films, poignent ones and wacky ones. This one is the former. It's sweet, with goodn dialogue and excellent acting by Berry. The interesting music also adds to the movie."
3,"Look At Me..Great topic for teens, but lots of blah blah","For high school students: this movie offers a great theme for teens: self image. Unfortunately, the theme itself is drowned out by too much dialogue. As a high school French teacher, I rate this film as boring for students."
3,Enjoyable,"There are two kinds of French films, poignent and sureal, Look at me is the former. It's has a good story and excellent acting (especially from Ms. Berry.) It also have an interesting (and different soundtrack.) If you like foreign films, check it out."
4,Nice toy,"My 2 1/2 year old son is just starting out in the train world, and this seems like a nice thing to add to his collection. The toy is durable and looks good. A little pricey, but I guess that has to do with the brand name."
4,Review on Little Women,I thought the book was rather good. It was kind of easy to read and easy to follow. I also liked it because it was about four sisters. I think books with sisters it in are good for children to read so they no what other ppl think its like to have sisters. Then ending was really cute too.
5,A good book!,"I had to read this book for a high school English project. I thought the book was very informative. Im a very picky reader and I can not read a book with boring spots, but i can assure you this book was good. I found no boring spots. I didn't wanna put the book down, event after event, it kept on coming. I encourage you to read this book whether your 14 years old or 60 years old. It teaches good moral values."
3,Hard to get to the good stuff,"The beginning is very slow and hard to get into, but once u get to the middle it is a very fun, lighthearted piece. I will say I don‘t think there is a clear point to the story other thenLife never turns out exactly as you plan."
5,Little Women,"What a great read. Saw the movie many years ago, but the book took the story so much more in depth.Really enjoyed it."
2,Lots of spelling errors.,"I realize this book was free -- good deal! But, I selected this book to read outloud to a woman in a nursing residence who cannot see good enough to read herself. Her hearing is also an issue. Therefore, I read loudly. The errors in spelling make the flow of reading aloud difficult. Otherwise, it gets the point across. My mom read this book to me when I was little, and therefore wanted to share it."
3,Good,"Its a good history, easy to read and enjoying each page.Good for the Autor and for Amazon that make possible read it."
4,little women,LITTLE WOMEN IS A GOOD BOOK. I COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER READ IT IN NO TIME AT ALL
5,Summary,"Little Women is a classic written by Louisa May Alcott about four sisters and their mother during the Civil war. I have loved this book since I was in 4th grade and continue to love it now.....I won't say how many years later. It's a great read, great descriptions of the morals and manners of the area. I would highly recommend."
4,Little Women,"One of those books I never read as a kid and decided to read before I read 'March', written by the author of 'People of the Book'."
4,Love it!,A timeless classic that all should read as youth and adults. Thouroughly enjoyed the whole book. Our book club of twenty women enjoyed it as well.
4,"Touching read, with much relevance to modern times.","This was a special read for me as I grew up watching June Allyson play Jo March in the 2nd movie remake. It was interesting to read all the similarities between the book and all movie versions, but I also enjoyed the stories that were not included in any of the movies. Interestingly, I enjoyed many of the lessons regarding growing up and marriage that I feel still ring true in our current times."
5,Gshifflett,What a wonderful book! I loved the parts which we've enjoyed in the movie and enjoyed the additions in print which the movie doesn't contain.
3,Kindle download,Haven't read it yet but wanted to have it available -- it was a favorite book from my childhood & I'd like to have it where I can easily access it.
5,A most enjoyable read,"This truly is a beautiful classic, with stories and lessons about love and family that are as true today as when they were so wonderfully written. A most enjoyable read that warms the heart and feeds the soul."
4,Not my typical cup of tea but...,"I am not usually into this genre of books. I typically stick with murder/mystery books, but since this was a classic and was free, I decided to give it a try. I love it! The way Ms. Alcott developed these characters made me fall in love with them and think about them even when I wasn't actively reading the book. Once finished, I found myself wondering what happend next to the characters and how they lived the rest of their lives. Not something I usually think about after finishing a story. Beautiful book and beautifully written."
5,My fave,"My fave book of all times. It brings u in the christmas,mood. Also sad too and loving love story too. If u are a sucker for stuff like this"
5,Great Book!,"Enjoyed every minute. Being a woman in my late twenties, this book is s great reminder of timeless lessons on love, f as July and relationships."
5,CLASSIC!,It's a classic! How can you not fall in love with the characters every time you read it! Jo is my favorite!
3,Little Women,"Little Women was a classic,but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was interesting, I'll give it that, but it didn't have the key things that a good piece of literature should have.It was set in New England and told the lives,sometimes dull lives, of the four March girls. Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less. Remember there are always two sides to a loved classic book; it may be loved by some but disliked by others."
5,One of my favourite books of all time,"Little Women is about 4 sisters the oldest Meg, the tomboyish Jo,sweet Beth and little Amy. Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said ""told yah so"" and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading. They still haven't read it but thats their loss!"
4,Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Jr. Library Ed.,"I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."
1,Pass on this one,"First, this is only the first half of ""Little Women."" Yes, this is the book originally published under that title, but usually it is bundled with the sequel, ""Good Wives."" This volume only covers the period up to Meg's wedding.Second, this adaptation has taken all the color out of the work. The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), ""...young readers like to know 'how people look.'"" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."
1,I guess you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover,"This is one of the greatest works of American fiction ever written. It touches my heart in a different way each time I read it, and I have read it several times-every Christmas since I was 12. I've been looking to replace my worn, cheap, but dearly loved copy with something with a classic cover to mirror the classic literature its binding holds. This ""Deluxe Edition"" is a disgusting display of...I don't know what. The cover has nothing to do with the story. Cartoon scribbles of girls with pimples? Not only is this unappealing, it also implies that what lies on the inside is inconsequential dribble which it most certainly is not.Buy this book, just not this edition."
3,"A classic child's book - better read as a child, than adult","I selected this price due to its price (free) and remembering reading it as a child. I read about a third and realized it was too idealistic for my adult tastes, and stopped."
3,Dated,"I had read every Louisa May Alcott novel as a girl, begining with Little Women with great pleasure. Recently I sat down in excited anticipation to read this story to my ten-year-old daughter, only to have both of us fall asleep in record time. Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read. I'm sorry to admit that my old friend is collecting dust on the shelf, but the world is full of great books of our time just waiting to be read in substitution."
1,Go to Borders instead!!,"Borders Classics is a Borders imprint that makes similar cloth covered versions of classic tales. The reviewers who were looking for ""something special"" for Little Women will find it in the Borders version. The book is almost as beautiful as the story. The Penguin Classics version is just plain ugly."
5,A Favorite,"I can't add much that hasn't been shared in other reviews. Little Women by Louisa May Alcott introduce us to four remarkable characters: sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March. Alcott wrote the first volume in two and a half months. That blows me away. The two volumes have been combined as one since 1880. Read Wikipedia for more information, especially the ""Autobiographical Context"" that shares information about Ralph W. Emerson."
1,"Awful, one of the worst books existing","I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.The movie, however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good."
1,sucked redlands ca,This book was a bland romance book.I am twelve year old boy so dont get be wrong that i read love books.Theonly reason i had to read this book was because my mom made me read it for homeschooling.I would no recomend this book for boys.Girls may be wild about this book but i think the book was crappy.But i gave little men a very good read.You can read it if you type in little men.Go to second page and its the first book on the top.Please read it.
2,THIS BECAME A CLASSIC?,"Little Women has a very weak plot, going back and fourth between what the character is thinking and what is actually happening.This book also completely lacked amusement! It talked and talked and talked, about NOTHING!!!! It absolutly moved to slow and when the book finally started getting faster, so much had changed in the story!There are much better classics out there! DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Cornier Than Corn Itself,"This book is so corny I can barely stand it. It tells the story of four obnoxious, annoying sisters and their silly mother. The story is so corny I can't bear it. How can people call this piece of trash a classic? The cheesiness and pure sugary-sweetness of the whole thing is awful. STAY AWAY!!"
1,A piece of classic [junk],"This book [stunk] beyond all belief! It was already bad enough that the March sister were extreamly good (too good)and how they complained about stupid stuff, like noses and how they were poor (which doesn't even make sense if you have a servant and a manor!)but she killed of Beth so early in the series and Jo didn't even marry Laurie!! But instead married her sister IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT!!! It makes me wonder what could possibly fill the pages of the other two books. So I DO NOT recommend this book to ANYONE! Instead, try Harry Potter :)"
5,This book was excellent!,"This book was excellent. I would highly recommend it to others. I expected the ending to end one way and was completely surprised when it ended another way. Even though the time period is way back when, it kept me interested."
3,Not for me,I guess I should have realize I didn't like the movie so I don't know what made me think I would like the book.
5,I really liked it,5 stars!!!! Release the money or a nerd will appear on the school board members and more people because ratings
3,Still a joy to read,"I read this many times as a child and am enjoying it all over again. Yes, the language is a little dated but the story is still touching and the book is filled with life lessons that still apply today. Worth a read."
5,A classic,Well-loved book that I have enjoyed time and time again. Glad to have it in my library. It doesn't need my recommendation. It stands on its own content!
1,Sad edition of a beloved favorite,"I agree with the reviewer below me 100%. This cover is disgusting. I was hoping to find a lovely copy of this book for my sister as a gift because she loved the copy I purchased for myself a while back. Mine is from Borders classics but unfortunately I don't think they are making the same copy anymore. It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics. I guess this was an attemt of modernizing a book which doesn't need to be modernized in order to be loved, that is what makes it a classic after all. What a shame."
3,Little Women,"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."
5,Excellent product!,"I was looking for an unabridged copy of Little Women, with only Louisa May Alcott's name as authoress. I purchased this book for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. The book was brand new and was exactly what we were looking for. The illustrative artwork was a complementary addition to the novel. It was also shipped in a very timely manner. I had it in plenty of time to give for Christmas."
4,Little Women,"I have seen the movie, both the old and new version. I truly like the story, but as a male student required to read this prior to 8th grade, I think I would have rather read ""Little Men."""
3,Little Women--A Review from a Point of View,"I felt that Little Women was a very moving story. I had tears in my eyes when Mr. March returns from the War. Louisa Mae Alcott was a very talented writer, indeed. I'm sure her story has touched many other hearts just as it has touched mine. Anyone, young or old, should read Little Women. It is a story of unfaltering love for one's family, even though times are hard and the limits of tempers are tested, the March family still shared its love."
3,Different times for sure,I have not read the whole book but thought it was ok just not interesting enough to finish the whole book.
3,little women,Little women is a ok book. It's a nice family book but could use more drama. It's good for little girls but be sure to know it doesn't relate to are modern world.
4,book downloads,This is great I can now read again just downloaded Little Women my favourite book..now I can read whenever I want where ever And I can carry more than one book. Great!!
5,Greaaaaaat Book!You will never want to put it down!!,"Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes."
3,"Probably a good book, but not for everyone","My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and ""Little Women"" is one of them. But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be ""tomboyish"" and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like it nevertheless."
3,Little Women,"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amys' father has gone to war and they all have their own problems. Meg suffers from her own vanity, Jo suffers from her temper, Beth is in danger of dying and Amy suffers injustice at school.I don't reccomend this book to boys, but it might be good to some girls."
1,Not my favorite classic =(,"This book, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott was boring. I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring ""1800's"" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, ""what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?"" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is ""boring!"" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a mature mind and enjoys reading classic style books."
1,Politically Correct Vandalism,"The rating is for THIS edition of the book, feminist ideologue Elaine Showalter's genital revisionism blots the text everywhere. Nor is the theme concerned with the ""tension between social responsibility & individual and artistic freedom"" except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with ""group identities"" who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility & intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to ""re-frame"" ""de-construct"" and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture. Showalter's a scumbag."
2,Just okay,"I really dont know what the hype is over this book. Its considered a classic, yet, it is boring reading. I didn't find any of the characters of any interest and the pace is slow."
2,LONG AND BORING,"Little Women is too long and very boring. There is just so much extra details in this book!!!! Half of wich, do not even make any sense!!! The girls in the book worry about everything and constantly cry, Marmee is and unrealistic mother, and EVERYTHING IS DESCRIBED! If you have patience for tiny print and dry story, you may find this book somewhat interesting.Also, I would like to ask, what is a teen girl (Amy) doing getting married to a man AT LEAST 40 YEARS OLD??!!"
2,"Not bad, but not excellent.","I found Little Women okay, but a bit boring at times. There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"
5,Touching story,"I had never before read this book, but I had loved the movie for many years. I decided to download the free kindle book and read it. It was a truly touching story, but I have found that it varies somewhat from what I remember from the movie. Of course that is always the case. Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."
5,Little Women,I ordered this book so I would have a copy to review and read as a student is reading the same title. We can discuss the book since we both are reading it at the same time.
4,Little Women,"Little Women is a wonderful book for all ages. No matter how old you are, or whether you are a male or female, there is something in there for you. So pick it up and get ready for a wonderful trip through the minds of 4 girls and their mother during the war, and listen to their tough, fun, and rough times! I guarantee you a wonderful read!"
5,Timeless Tale,I'm a fanatic fan of Little Women. This book is wonderful beyond words. I just cannot put it down. It has humour and warmth writtn into it. A Great book. Really a must-read. If there was a 6 stars mark i would have given it to Little Women:)
4,Great Book of Sorrow,"I would have rated this book a 5, except the author played with me the whole time, when all I wanted was for her to get down to the point. Also this book has many main effents and that makes it hard to make a summary which I must do for class. If I had rated if a 5 I would of explained that as a natural phenomen for nothing this good has ever gotten into print."
5,An old classic that still has relevance,"I never got around to reading this earlier in life , but am so glad that I did finally have the time. You'll be drawn into the book by the characters and their dilemmas with life. Yes, it's from times past, but the nature of mankind hasn't changed. Read it!"
1,Little women,Very long and boring never read this book you will regret it with all your life trust me and my friends we all read this and we all hate it!!!!&
4,I like this book because...,It has adventures as well as relationships and humorous sections. Even though I struggled through some parts I still think that it is a great book.
4,Good,This is a really good book. It can get kind of slow at times and it's very long but definitely a good read.
2,Little women,I think this book is a touching story of a mother and her kids trying to live happy romance and more. Mother got what she wanted a grand child and even though they never became rich they were rich in love affection and happiness.
4,Our 7th Reading Selection,Little Women was our reading selection for October 2002. We thought this timeless classic story of four sisters was wholesome and heartwarming.This coming of age story that was inspired by the author's real life family teaches family values and morals. Each of the girls have their own set of problems but through love and understand they learn the lessons of life.All of us agree that the character were well written and the story is one that will stay in your heart long after you have read the same page. A few of us have read the many times and we all highly recommend it.
3,Wonderful Story but Lacking in Quantity,I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy. Pages 383-430 were missing from my book! Quite a disappointment. I would recommend a better quality book from a publisher who won't leave out 47 pages.
4,""" The Little Women"" are all grown up","I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."
4,Excitement for your bookshelf!,"Growing up in the March house is no easy task. Four girls growing up during the Civl War was hard for tomboyish Jo, gentle Beth, helpful Meg and exciting Amy. When they meet their wealthy nieghbor, Laurie, life becomes anything but boring. They go through spring days and trials together. As the sisters go from girlhood to womenhood, they find their selves going through life changes they never imagined they would go through. So dive into the wonderful adventures of ""Little Women"" as they learn life changing lessons."
3,Little Women,"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."
1,Warning! About this version,"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."
1,full of spelling and grammar mistakes,"I love ""Little Women"" by L.M. Alcott. It's a great book. Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."
1,Charlie Brown,This book was okay but boring it has no action it also did not change from a little girls voice to a big girl or women voice
4,My wife's enjoying this book,"My wife bought this book because it was one of the classics, and while she hasn't finished it yet, she reports that she's really enjoyed what she has read of it so far."
5,The love of a family,"What more can be said about Little Women? This classic story of a family of six has warmed many hearts and it has warmed mine again. As an adult, I am sure I feel differently about this book at age 64 than I did at age 10. We women have come a long way and this book is a gentle reminder of all that has happened in 200 years. My book group enjoyed reading about this feisty,, friendly family."
5,like my daddy said,"Twilight. diary of a wimpy kid, ok. But Little Women, red badge of curage, moby dick classics!! I got my library(yes i spelled that right) when i was two years old,and i have loved to read ever since. This is awesome reading!"
5,Iittle women the best book ever,This book is a tale of sadness truth and love. IT is a good book for you to read to you kids. truly touching and funny at tmes. A poor family with the father away in a war. The mother and her four daughters must make do. There are tradgedy like when He youngest daugter falls through the ice and grave tradgedys like when the daughter Beth dies. Read this book to be touched and filled with hope.
1,Not Eye Catching Work!,"Maybe to the older person ""Little Women"" is an interesting book, but let's face it, the new genereation is just not interested in this kind of book. When I was in grade school, I had to read it for a project, and I hated it. The reason was probably beause it was not flashy or out of the ordinary. It just told the average story about the average family at that time. it may be interestign for some, but the young readers of today just don't like it all that much."
2,Boring,"Very boring. I had to read it for something I did at school. The beggining is OK but after awile it gets really boring. For example they propose he gets turned down ect. I didn't really getthe feel for this book. I had heard it was supposed to be good. But I heard it from one of my substitutes she said it was really good but I don't really like romance, stress, and poverty in stories but if you like that you can try this book. I DO NOT. YES I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Good Social history,"I read this book after talking with a friend of mine about it. She said I would enjoy it because of the historical setting (Civil War). I took her advice end enjoyed reading it. It gives a look at the social history of the time which is all too often over looked by many authors, something about battles and war being more interesting. Don't let the title fool you, men and women will enjoy this great piece of literature despite some of the questionable events (A man marrying a women 20 years or so his junior was more acceptable back then)"
2,Disappointing,"I am genuinely baffled by the degree of devotion this book still inspires based on the reviews at this site. I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47. I still dislike it. The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people. Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels. In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc. This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece."
5,Little Women,"This book has become one of my favorites. I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."
4,A Treat For All!,"As the father of a teenage daughter who was about to see the screen play based on this book, I am probably an atypical reader of ""Little Women"", but I enjoyed it none the less. ""Little Women"" tells the charming story of the March family as the girls grow over several years. Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time. Occasionally it is refreshing to read a book which is just plain enjoyable, without devious characters and subliminal agendas. This book is a delight, even for those who are not, and never were, Little Women."
5,This was a great book and I could read it a million times.,Little Women is a absolutely great book!! I just couldn't put it down. I also think if you like Little Women you should read Jo's Boys. I liked that book because Jo was my favorite character. Take my advice and read both Little Women and Jo's Boys.
3,A Little Sad,"Little Women is one of my favorite pieces of classic literature. When I realized I didn't own a copy, I decided to invest in one. So I purchased this edition.I tried reading it, and the font didn't agree with me too much. Furthermore, the binding challenges ones ability to keep the book open in a manner proper for reading.After a few tries, I gave up and decided it was better to just let it sit and look pretty on my shelf.I should have gotten the softcover version."
2,I didn't enjoy it that much,I really did no t find this book interesting. I like James bond more. I grade it 5 stars. This is a girl but one who is a tomboy. But that is my opinon. Most people love it but I did not
3,An Overlong Soap Opera!!!,"An adorable book that may seem long at times.The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a recounting of their lives, until three of them get married and have babies of their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places. Iprefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)"
5,The second best book ever! (After “Buffalo Bill's“ autobiography),The first version of this book (which is this one) is so much better than the other versions! This is another great book!
3,nice book,Nice book. Great for kids. I bought a bunch of the classics for my two daughters. Great price and would probably buy again
5,a touching story,"A book of happiness and sadness, ups and down of our lives. This a light-hearted story, however Beth's death makes it a really sad story. Any one who read it once will want to read it many many times more."
5,A Classic!,"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."
3,There's a better print out there!,"Little Women (the book) is a great novel, and deserves 5 stars, it's wholesome and innocent, and it's a genuine classic ... but if you want the best edition of the novel, I suggest the Barnes&Noble print of it, and that's why I gave this review only 3 stars. The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is ""Home Sweet Home""."
5,A Classic,Girls of all ages should read this book and come back to read it again as women. This novel is truly a treasure.
5,"Little Women, American Classic","The loveable March sisters are easy to grow on you. For my recent (14th) birthday, my 16 year old brother gave me Little Women. I read it, and it took me a while, but it was totally worth it. Occasionally, I would have to re-read sections. But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!"
5,Classic,This book is a classic but one of my favorites. Bringing me through many emotions and allowing me to escape my own worries for a moment of laugh and cries
4,Little Women,"Re-reading it now. A good balance between superfluous writing and practical observation of women in that era. I enjoy Little Women both for the natural and whimsical natures of the girls and have always been a fan of their funny personalities, especially Jo and Amy. Highly recommended."
4,"Good, Homey Book","I found this book very ""comfortable"". I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."
5,One of the best books ever written...,"Little Women is a timeless story of four sisters and their lives as they grow into adulthood. I read it first when I was quite young, but even now as I reread it, I never tire of it. Parents, you should buy this for your daughters. Every girl I know who has read it loves it and identifies themselves with one of the sisters. I would recommend this book even for adult women who have never read it. It is wonderful."
3,Great for the price!,"Nothing is better than free! Aside from a few typographical errors in the Kindle version, this book is an excellent e-book freebie. I had put off reading it since I was very young but had always wondered at the hype of this book. It may well be considered a literary classic, although I still don't consider it a must-read for every young girl."
4,timeless classic,"I finally read Little Women when I wa 23. When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered ""cool"" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book. I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant."
5,Bookwiz,"The Book little women is a classic tale of four sisiters liveing with there mother, there father risking his life in the civil war. it tells what it was like to be a girl in the times of the war. The girls are people you could look up to. Jo the secound eldest is a tom boy wishing that she was born one, and a book worm. Amy the youngest one is very wise for her age. Meg the eldest sister is about fitting in and watching over her sisters when ever there mother is not around. Beth loves her music andthere old piano, she seems like one of shyest and careing of all the sisters. all of them are different but they all have one thing in comon, there family and they care for each other.i love the illustrations of Dinah Dryhurst. the pictures bring the story to life. they are Beautifuly done."
4,"Part I only; ""Little Women"" (w/out ""Good Wives"" book)","I bought this perennial favorite to add to my barely-started collection of these tiny Collector's Library books (sadly, B&N; discontinued publication of these). I love that it's small and hardcover- perfect for traveling- especially for long hours on the plane or whatnot.I was a bit disappointed to find that this book contains only part I of Little Women, ending with Chapter 23 (""Aunt March Settles the Question""). It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my ""home copy"" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one. But I thought I'd let you know this book only features part I so that you know what to expect!"
1,NOT Unabridged!!!,"Please don't misunderstand me...I am NOT disparaging the original story of Little Women. The one star rating is for this particular edition of the book. I have loved this book all my life and having worn out my childhood copy, was hoping to get a new one. An UNABRIDGED copy!! This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy! If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!! I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!! I will be returning this copy and continue my search for a REAL copy of Little Women that hasn't had words changed, modernized, or ""dumbed down""!!"
3,classic,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
4,Very well done,"This book is very well read but we found it hard to follow the characters when it is being read to us. We got it for our 7 year old and she was clearly not interested. We will save it for when she is a little older. It takes a bit of practice for this visual generation to learn how to ""listen"" to books."
4,Classic for a reason,"I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it. Although the religious undertones are pronounced, the story still draws you in -- you want to know what happens to these girls and their world is very vividly created.Like many free Kindle books, there are multiple typos. However, it didn't really detract from the reading experience for me."
3,A Classic,"Although somewhat dated, it was a pleasure to read this story of 4 girls growing up in a simple time. I've already picked up 'Jo's Boys' to read more."
1,I really do like Women Just not these,I just could not get in to this and had it because it has certain items I needed to know.
3,A good classic for children,"I read this book when I was a young boy, as well as the other three books of the series. It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments. If you like the first part, you will also like the other three novels, although this is the best."
2,Most young girls will love it,"I did, at age 8 or so, though, re-reading it today, I find itrather grim and dull. Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the ""poor"" outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood. END"
2,A woman's book,"I hate to say it but this is a book designed primarily for women. I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. ""About bloody time!"" I cried. I thought about giving this book a solid three stars but that would have been too generous. It is regarded as a classic but to me it was a sentimental piece of rubbish. 2 generous stars"
3,The story of a carrier pigeon.,"This book, which won the 1928 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, is the story of a carrier pigeon raised in India who is used by a Bengal Regiment in France during World War I. Some aspects of the book appear illogical and I doubt that I would have cared for the book had I read it when I was young. But, I am probably in the minority."
1,Nothing but problems,The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included. Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive. Even with batteries the xenon light did not work. So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries. The case was nice however.
5,awesome!!,"I bought this barbell for my inner conch piercing in my right ear. While it looks wonderful in the picture, it is even more beautiful when you actually see it. I love the way it looks in my ear, and it dangles behind my lobe, just a bit below. It's very pretty and unique. I definately recommend this ring!"
5,Awesome,"The kit was great and really helped me learn the concepts behind chirality, enantiomers, diasteriomers, and so on. I was a little disappointed that the professor required students to purchase this kit, and we hardly used it; but I intend on saving the kit for next semester when I have to take Biochemistry! :)"
2,used package almost empty,"Unfortunately, I have bought an used box (on Amazon it was written that all pieces were there), but when I opened the box I realized that it was almost empty, so it was not usable."
5,One of the most beautiful things you'll ever hear!,"I don't know of many people who would place k.d. lang on a list of the most beautiful women of all-time, and I'm not one who would either. But let me tell you this, she has quite possibly the most beautiful voice a woman has ever possessed. Her singing is without flaw, her voice is like a angel. It's other-worldly, she has a God-given talent. Tony Bennett didn't call her the best voice of her generation for nothing! Of her solid and beautiful body of work, her talent was never put to better use than on Ingenue. This is a remarkable album, the flow is perfect. The Mind Of Love is beautiful, Miss Chatelaine is like a samba, Still Thrives This Love is sultry, Outside Myself is heart-breaking, and Constant Craving is k.d.'s best song. I rarly say things like this, but this is a work of art! Ingenue is a album that will move even the coldest of heart's, I whole-heartly recommend you buy this album."
4,My first kd cd,"This is the first kd lang cd i ever bought, and it was just because of constant craving. The rest of the album doesn't really match constant craving in style, and at first i was disappointed, but after listening to the cd a few times, i was hooked. Most of the songs are about desire and love and are jazzy and smooth. I love the whole album, particularly Miss Chatelaine, the mind of love, and still thrives this love. I love the jazzy, exotic beat and her silky voice really shines on this album."
5,Chuck Hilger,"The movie is excellant, especially if you are a dog lover and enjoy a good story line. The movie also arived very quickly."
3,This is a dog-lover's story - I love beagles!,"The movie is good and kept the class of 3rd graders attention and interest. However, we were all disappointed with the movie not following the book...characters, some storyline, and ending is so very different. The book was an Newberry Award winning book - wish Hollywood would not have made the changes."
2,Shiloh without a soul,"As I watched this movie, I felt like somebody explained the plot to the film producers, but they never read the book. The movie is missing everything that made the book special: the sense of ruralness and poverty (it looks like middle class or higher), the childhood innocence, and most important, the insights into human nature. I don't want to spoil it, but the lesson learned in the movie is unrelated to the lesson in the book, and possibly contradictory. If you love the book, the movie will disappoint you. Having said that, my 7-year-old enjoyed both. Adults may not enjoy it so much. I was sad that they wasted such a good book."
1,A bad film adaptation of a great book,"It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this. This film was not at all faithful to the book. The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg. In the movie, the spot is way over on his back! In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long. In the movie, it's like a foot!The classic ""this little piggy goes to market"" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie! Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for)"
4,Great kid movie adults will like too,"Sure the acting was a bit stiff, and the story too much like an after school special, but the movie was just a cute little thing to watch on a Sunday night at home."
3,decent book,A bit too much analysis with too few descriptions/explanations. Does a a good job analyzing alternative lines. Pretty solid production
1,Awful Book Cover and Content...,"When you first see this book you figure, well the content has to be better than the cover. As amazing as it might sound, the content is even worse. The amount of errors really baffled me and stressed me out. Trying to look up things and the entire layout is just awful. How awful books like this get published is beyond my knowledge. Perhaps someone lost a bet or Schiller owns their soul. Maybe if your a 900 player this would help you break 1000. If your getting this book thinking your gonna be able to defend d4. I guess your gonna have to find out the hard way how shoddy this book is. A bad chess player that writes awful books is a scary thing. I think Ken Smith and Schiller should start their own club. Donate your money to a good charity or buy yourself something worth having. The only use this book has is the hope of being burned when no logs are left."
2,Not a fan,Purchased these to wear with my fins while snorkeling. I found them uncomfortable as the seams run on top and underneath your foot. I did wear them for a while but ended up taking them off and never wore them again.
3,They can't make seats either.,"Perhaps Harley is going to publish an after-market book to correct all of the flaws in this book. Probably in chrome. I originally bought the book hoping to do some resarch on historic color schemes for a new bike, and in that quest I found the book to be quite valuable. Beyond that I found it to be curious that the book was a square format and all of Harley's bike are a horizontal format, so that every beauty shot of the bikes is printed across a gutter. You never get to see a bike in full. It's maddening. That being said, the history of the company and the culture is wonderful and inspiring. The shots from the archives are very well done and the tone of voice is very engaging. I just wanted to see the bikes. It's just like Harley's seats, good looking but kind of uncomfortable."
4,A century in the life of The Hog,"Clearly a grand advertisement & a fine way to take a peek at the transformation of The Hog. Along the way you'll catch glimpses of both ten decades of advertising & dressage styles.If you're expecting to see the development of the mystique we've come to associate with The Hog, you will be disappointed for those who make The Hog are not necessarily those with whom it is associated. I don't think I've seen so many squeaky-clean, carefree people up close, sans helmets too!Actually, a fascinating book & certainly one any lover of motorbikes, the open road & social styles will enjoy."
5,A Must-Read for Bikers!,"this is a great coffee table book - not too big, not too small. i actually bought this book as a gift for my boss, as he is a huge harley davidson fan and has a fatboy harley himself. he really liked it! the pics. and the history in this book is awesome."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"What can I say? It's very difficult to find the right words to describe this mesmerising film. Firstly the disc itself - superb extra's and the print is remarkably clean for it's age; another top job by Criterion. As for the film...It is a true work of art, one of those films that are fantastic in every area in such a way that raises it above the standard of general excellence and makes it truly memorable. But it is the sheer sense of wonder that deserves the most praise, the magic that surrounds the Beast's castle will make your jaw drop to the floor with a near continuous myriad of sumptuous special effects and brilliant inventiveness. The performances are also wonderful and it is extremely moving as well as entertaining, with so many memorable moments...I really cannot fully express the delight this movie creates, you really have to see it. They well and truly do not make them like this anymore."
5,"That one is not for your kids, it's for you.","Before I have known Cocteau like a very interesting poet and stage writer and La Belle et La Bete is the first (but sure not the last) of his films for me. I was stunned by the visual beauty and surreal mood of the movie. It's amazing how a fairy tale, which is nowadays considered being a child's thing can be turned to a such at the same time macabre and beautiful piece of art by a great artist. Or maybe just returned to the roots? Take your kid's book, forget the Walt Disney images and try to think of what the fairy tales really mean. You will be scared to go to bed (there's something under it). To return to the film - the end left me totally perplexed: I'm not at all sure that they lived happily ever after."
2,"Essential film, not so good transfer (Criterion Spine # 6)","Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast is a universal masterpiece. But the transfer for this edition (Criterion Spine #6) is not up to the editor's usual standards : scratches, jumps, blurs and sound hissing. Plus... the opening credits are not the wonderful original ones, when Cocteau is seen writing the names of the film crew on a school blackboard. Wait a while and get the new Criterion edition, due in late 2002 !"
5,hot damn! flawless and masterfully well done,"cocteau pulls it off again with ""beauty and the beast"". even though i like his works of 'pure surrealism' better, this movie is a must buy if you're even slightly interested in the visuals of the surrealist movement. the part where beauty's father first goes into the beast's castle is absolutely incredible--watch for the clock with moving eyes and a somewhat sour facial expressions. (i'd be pissed too if i was a clock.) the ending is a bit puzzling and i'm not sure if iunderstood it properly, but i didn't really watch it for the story which is pretty trite and all too oft' told, but it doesn't really master since the rest of the film is so perfect and utterly captivating. whoever played the beast did a tremendous job and really became the character. a necessity!"
3,I'd Give you one if I'd received the DVD,"I was looking forward to watching it again after so long, but alas, over one month after purchase and I'm still waiting to receive the DVD. Ignore the rating; I fell in love with this film many years ago, but seeing as I've yet to receive the DVD its a bit silly rating it.K"
3,Translated into english = substitles in english only!,"I am a huge fan of Beauty and the Beast in pretty much any form. But here is the problem. On Amazon's web site and on the package of this DVD, it states ( Original Fable translated into english. ) In truth this means english subtitles. I bought this in the pretence that the actual movie itself would be english spoken. So I was quite disapoined when I found out it hadn't realy been translated into english. When you have to constantly read the subtitles its hard to actually enjoy the movie. It was going at a fast pace. This is why I give this DVD 3 stars intead of 5 stars. Because I got myself excited about it being in english, instead I got a huge let down."
4,Just a CURIOUS Question,Well since I don't have a Blue Ray player it will be a while before I can watch this! But it is a movie I've wanted to see for a long time and figured if I'm going to buy it Get The Best Version~!Now for the Question.....Ratio Aspect is listed as 1:77:1And the Blue Ray that I got in is listed as 1:33:1Did I get an incorrect disc.....Considering that there is only ONE Blue Ray disc type listed........or does Amazon have up ERRONEOUS Disc Information???Just wonderingHopefully I'll get an answerGypsy
3,The New Beauty Is Just OK,"Well...I almost hate to write this, because there's no doubt that Criterion is the platinum standard in DVD. I just watched a review copy of the ""restored"" Beauty And The Beast and it's not as ""beauty""-ful as the original Criterion edition that came out a few years ago. The film does look pristine, but the depth of the original is missing. It almost looks too squeaky clean and...well, digital. Make no mistake, you'll be completely entrhalled by this DVD, but if you can get your hands on the other Criterion edition, do it. You'll be even more enchanted."
5,Better than Disney,"This adaptation of the famous fairytale is a wonderful French classic that no well rounded movie collection should be without.Considering the age of the film the special effects are remarkably good; and the overall design and atmosphere of the film capture the spirit of the original story perfectly.Since the film was made for children as well as adults, the dialogue is very clear and simple, making it a wonderful choice for beginning French students as well as non French speakers.I had my younger sister watch it with me (she is 14 years old) and she told me that she likes it much better than the Disney version which is high praise indeed!"
5,The most beautiful film ever made,"Upon leaving the theater after viewing Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Greta Garbo was reported to have said, ""Bring back my beautiful Beast!"" Amen."
5,Good product but you can get it for almost 1/2 price somewhere else,No compaints at all after a few months of use. I definitely recommend this product... but look elsewhere. Amazon's price - $79. Walmart's price - $39. Same product.
4,Economical Seat - Poorly designed cup holder,"I like this seat so far. I wanted an affordable seat for my 3 yr. old son and I wanted one with a cup holder (because his big brother's booster seat has one). The seat seems comfortable and is belts are fairly easy to latch and unlatch. I sometimes have trouble with the release between his legs, probably from trying to do everything with one hand while holding something else in other hand! Easy to adjust strap length.........My only complaint is the cup holder, it's junk and won't stay attached to the seat. I read and re-read the directions but I can't get it to stay on."
4,Lester's loving lips linger on his memory of Pops,"Lester Bowie here dons his lab coat to produce some jazz magic. The first track is full of Bowie's trumpet speaking of his love for Louis Armstrong's tone. ""Think"" is too slight to mention. ""Lament"" is introduced by 3 minutes of drones, then a beat and singing chord voicings announce a delicate solo by Stanton Davis. ""Coming back, Jamaica"" is a calypso/reggae tribute to Jamaican music. This is no surprise as Bowie lived there for a while. ""Nonet"" is rhythm and pure tone, led by the composer's tuba. The last track opens with Bowie's 'trumpet with a human voice' until the arrival of a swinging tempo propels a performance even the Duke himself would have been proud of. Following from the interesting instrumentation of the band and the high quality of the players, this is a sterling effort that signalled the albums that were to come."
4,"VERY ORIGINAL, VERY INTERESTING","Although I was slightly disappointed that the real vampire Count Dracula was not in this, I was quickly surprised at this rather genious reworking of the legend. This book depicts ""real"" vampirism, without the supernatural aspect, displaying it as more of a disease than a hellish curse. The plot is like a modern telling of the original Lugosi film, with some original additions and twists created by the author. The characters' names are the same, and at some points in the story it feels like we are not in modern day Georgia, but London in the 1800's. In any case, this was a very enjoyable book, and is by no means cliche or predictable. The ending, in particular was a very creative twist. What I loved most was how different this book would be than what I originally expected. If you love the classic monsters, or are a Dracula fan, read this book. It'll be a fun experience!"

5,One of Silvestri's Best,"Film Composer Alan Silvestri (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) has successfully portrayed the spiritual dimensions of the other side in the score to ""What Lies Beneath"". Silvestri is mostly known for action and dramatic scores, yet with this successful motion picture thriller, Silvestri is at his best composing dark suspenseful music to such a film. The ""Main Title"" track is beatifully crafted in melody and orchestration, as evident due to the role of the woodwinds. The track ""Ouiji Board"" is also beautifully written, since it is dark, slow, and pianisimo from the beginning. These sample views of his tracks are just a small replica of the whole score, which is definetly worth the time. The Hollywood Industry is making a comeback in horror feature films, and I believe Silvestri is contributing his heart and talent with this score. I recommend anyone interested in horror scores to purchase this CD!"
4,The Getaway...,"... is one of the most exciting cues I've heard in a long time. Alan Silvestri composed an atmospheric score with some great Hitchcock feel to it. The first half of the CD is pure haunting music you could compare with Jerry Goldsmith's ""The Haunting"" and one should listen to it with headphones. But the last three tracks are the reason I bought this CD. ""the Getaway"" and ""Reunion"" is very ""Psycho"" and ""Cape Fear"" sounding. The brass section plays a question-answer thing with the strings. But the best track has to be the End Credits which combines the best moments of the soundtrack... haunting and exciting."
2,Unnecessarily large pills,"I bought this product thinking that, since it's such a small amount of magnesium and there's no calcium filler and it's a tablet, the pills would be small. In actuality they're huge - thin enough, but really long, so if they turn in your throat you're in trouble. Guess I won't be ordering pills from Amazon anymore, at least not until they start showing pill size."
5,My first experience with Metheny!!,"Back in 1978, I remember turning on the television after school, waiting for HBO to come on (this was before they were on 24 hours a day and before they had 7 separate channels for HBO). In addition to showing the daily lineup, they used to play music before going into regular programing (HBO usually started around 4pm). One of the tracks I head was ""San Lorenzo"" from this album. I was immediately hooked on the smooth, methodic music that played, though I never knew what the tune was at the time. About 3 months later, I was in a electronics store and heard the same track. I looked around the store and found a stereo with the album cover. From that day, I became a fan of Metheny ever since. Buy and listen to the CD and you'll be hooked, too!!"
4,Exhilarating!,"This album was recorded before I was born but listening to it now, for the first time, more than 30 years later the music still sounds so fresh and exuberant. San Lorenzo, Phase Dance and April Joy are just amazing!"
5,PMG in Phase!,"A sparkling debut by Pat Metheny Group is possibly Metheny's best moment. For me, the best part of Pat Metheny's playing is the positive energy that diffuses throughout the surroundiing cast. In this outing, Pat's play is downright happy, but at the same time reflective and intriguing. Of course Lyle's playing suits Pat's to a T, and the rhythm section creates a perfect equilibrium. Even the devil himself could not listen through this album without cracking a smile at some point![...]"
5,February 2000 release is an audiophile's dream come true!,"The February 29th, 2000 release of Pat Metheny Group is the version I've been wishing for. I listened to it on a Linn Keltik tri-amped system driven by a Linn Ikemi CD player and a Linn Kairn preamp, and it exceeded my wildest expectations, especially in that the master tape used as a source was in pristine condition. Every piece of gear used in this reissue was first rate. Universal Classics Group deserves a standing ovation for doing such a fantastic remastering job. Bravo!"
5,Five stars hardly seems adequate,"Easily some of the most listenable and timeless music ever recorded. Years after first listening to this album I still get the chills. Breathtaking, spiritual, and stunningly beautiful. An absolute masterpiece."
5,A Real Page-Turner!,"Jane soon realized that her ""marriage"" isn't all that it seems. The man she thought was her husband is actually married to someone else! She also finds out that is pregnant. To provide for her son, she marries her kind, elderly employer ""in name only"". They travel to Hong Kong to ""The House of A Thousand Lanterns"" where her life changes forever. Her son's father arrives, a widower, to find his son and marry Jane. Jane's husband dies, and strange things begin to happen. Will she marry her son's father? Did he kill her husband? Is he trying to kill her? And what is the secret in ""The House of a Thousand Lanterns""?"
2,Vintage Victoria Holt,"I'm a loyal Victoria Holt fan, reading them in order, and I find that her early novels, Mistress of Mellyn, Kirkland Revels, Bride of Pendorric, seem to be the best. Later novels like Menfreya in the Morning and King of the Castle are dull and formulaic. I really like the Gothic, Romantic Suspense genre, but Victoria Holt's later novels begin to lack the mystery and suspense that I love. The House of a Thousand Lanterns, while being very well-written and slightly informative on the English and Chinese cultures, is meandering and slow until about the last 100 pages (382 page book). Then I couldn't put it down. After having read her historical ""The Queen's Confession"", I believe Holt's true calling is her historical novels under her Jean Plaidy pseudonym. I recommend ""The Queen's Confession"", and you will be hooked on her Jean Plaidy novels."
1,Worst Holt Book I Ever Read,"I am a huge Victoria Holt fan, but I hated this book. The only reason I hated it was because the man I wanted the heroine to end up with was killed off halfway through the book. I couldn't believe this character that I had grown to love died and that the heroine ended up with a character that I really didn't care for at all. It was shocking.The book itself was, as always, well-written. However, if you want to read this book, I suggest reading the beginning, because it certainly was the best part."
2,Yawn.....are we done yet?,"I am a huge fan of Victoria Holt, but this storyline isn't her best. You spend most of the book waiting for Jane to move to Hong Kong to live in the House of a Thousand Lanterns. Jane was the only protagonist that I felt would deserve her demise due to her blinded devotion to her first husband. Oh...her second husband was not old...in his early 50's.I also found the book filled with stereotypes against the Chinese and women in general. I don't think it was on purpose.Read this book to add to your Victoria Holt collection, just don't expect too much from it."
1,Just buy the originals!,"The songs are unispired lazy reworks slaughtering the originals. If you own the originals, listen to them - theres definatly no improvements here. If you dont own them, buy them! This is clearly just somone trying to cash in Rob Zombies work with very little effort or creativity - shame on them all"
1,Not up to standard...,"dodgy production, poor arrangements. I own all of Rob & WZ stuff, and cannot accept what they're doing to his tunes on this CD. Ordered it specially & got rid of it after 3 listens..."
5,"May not be the King Rob, but this music is awesome!",This CD contains music from some pretty awesome artists. I think Rob should be proud all of them did such a wonderful job with his music....
2,"Pretty good, for a while","I wanted to like this case; it feels like it should be sturdier than the OEM case, and it definitely looks more professional (though I'm not convinced that it's really leather). It is tight out of the box; the sock trick works well. The latch has a couple of big metal chunks that will probably wear through the liner and destroy your screen unless you get in the habit of turning the phone around (so it's less convenient to pull it out and use it). And mine broke after about 6 weeks of fairly lightweght use; the belt clip button detached itself from the case. It looks like the only thing holding it together was a little oval of double-stick tape.OK, what do you expect for eight bucks?"
2,"Agree with other reviews, doesn't last long","Overall I liked the case, but as two people previous to myself pointed out the belt clip falls out too easily. Within two weeks of purchase the soft leather that was supposed to hold the plastic tab in place had stretched to the point where it was freely rotating. After less then two months, it plastic tab falls out entirely, dropping the phone to the ground at inconvenient moments.It looks like I'll be looking for another case again."
1,The so called 2 pack Louis De Funes,"One of the packs contains movies that has very little of Louis De Funes in it, he acts in a very small capcity. Both packs are completely in French only with no subtitles of any other language at all. Very disappointed whereas virtually every other DVD do have subtitles. Advised to stay well clear unless one is fluent in French."
2,guess i'm out of step,"i suppose it's possible that men of the 442nd spoke as the characters in the book, but i just can't quite picture it. i wasn't in the 442nd, or in WWII, but i did serve in Marine infantry in Vietnam, and these characters just don't ring true with me. infantrymen are tired, tense, sore, filthy, and smell bad. they're thirsty and sometimes hungry. they usually don't have time to be afraid, even when the fecal matter hits the fan. nobody i ever heard (before arriving in the Nam) wondered (aloud, at least) how they would perform in combat. when they don't like one another it's usually a lot more direct."
5,I LOVE IT!,"this is deffenetly going to be a song i will listen to over and over for a while. it's so evil, and it can most deffinatly happen. this song is something that defenetly puts me in the mood to have rough.....*wink wink* listen to it and find out for yourself. your body will find a new craving..."
4,Good song,I think the Horrorist does a good job with this song. I haven't heard many techno tracks that tell a story along with a cool beat. The story might offend the soft at heart but I think most people will find it pretty cool
5,Awesome,"This is one of the most provocotive songs to ever hit the music scene. It is sure to turn heads & cause a stir. The music and the story are so well pieced together, it's scary!!!"
3,OLD VS NEW SERIES,The new Dawn Treader movie is not yet available for DVD. An older version being sold to unwary shoppers in a cover VERY like the new series. BE CAREFULL. Check the cast members! Don't be ripped off. The old series is NOTHING like the new one...not even close to the same quality.
3,was as the title suggested,"This book, was mostly about Napoleon. The title of the book, is of course about all of his family. This does not let you down. You can read about all of his brothers and sisters, and of course his courageous mother and father. Not much usually is documented so long ago and we struggle to find answers to questions about history. This is a good book to read if you wish to know about Napoleon in a deeper aspect."
4,"""unique"" Baywatch episode...","I used to have a lot of Baywatch's from TV taped on some videos but this is the only one i have now,and it's the actual video as represented here. It's a unique episode in which it's the only one in Baywatch history that features my three favorite blonds on the same episode...that being Pamela Anderson,Nicole Eggert and Erika Eleniak. You see,Erika's last show was this one and it happened to be Pamela's first.This is also Nicole's debut episode. So,that's a little Baywatch trivia i guess. Anyhow,decent story with awesome scenery as it takes place away from the beach (mostly) and is set somewhere on the Sacramento river. It'll make you wanna go camping watching this. The only sour parts of the show for me was Hobie constantly singing that gold miners song (you wanna strangle him after the 2nd time) and the fact that Erika (Shauni) cut her hair at some point and has it short. It should be long like Pamela's!!"
1,BAYWATCH/RIVER OF NO RETURN,"TO SAY THIS DVD ROCKS IS INANE,WHO WROTE THIS REVIEW,A FIVE YEAR OLD? THE DVD SUCKS APPLESEEDS!"
1,Broken,This was the correct part but was broken when received. I called Amazon and they said email the company. I emailed the company and heard nothing. Typical of the American business model. How can we set up a system where no one is responsible and be able to hide from the issue.
3,"Shipped wrong item, but rectified","At first they shipped the wrong item, but after a lenghty delay shipped the correct item and postage to return the incorrect one. Will try this distributor again to see if this was a fluke or not. Kept to their word anyhow, which is a positive statement. Just didn't appreciate a month delay from order date."
4,Good,"The main bulk of Down Beat is reviews of albums that are coming out the jazz world. Quite easily, the best parts are the special sections, and interviews they have with artists.Actually reading what the artists themselves have to say is very cool, especially to kids like me. :-)"
4,Barbie Bride,"My grand daughter loves the doll. She would like it to stand on it's own, but oh well. I did see this item in several stores after I ordered it on line with Amazon at much lower prices."
5,My husband loves it,"My husband bought this for use on his 2006 Ford F150 and he loves it. He used the 5/8"" receiver pin hole with a U-Haul Reese hitch and it's worked perfectly for him. There is only 1 pinhole location on this product. If you don't want it to stick out from the hitch, make sure the 5/8"" pinhole is towards the back of the Reese receiver slot. He hauls an enclosed utility trailer and it's very secure and safe."
5,Stan Locking Fuel Cap,"The Stant does its job just as I expected. Economical, functional and just what I needed to secure fuel storage insitu my 3rd Generation Camaros."
2,Lousy But Fun,"As a serious film, this one is a real dud. However, as a piece of hilariously inept production, it's a real winner. The plot is ludicrous, and the acting is equally poor. Still, some of the scenes are rather good, particularly the bizarre sequence which takes place in the village of the lunatics. Of course, the greatest lunatics are the people who produced this silly little film. No stars for quality, but 2 stars for pure comedy value."
2,Goofy!,"This film marked the singularly unspectacular acting(?) debut of champion gymnast Kurt Thomas, and attempted to cash in on his Olympic fame. However, good athletes don't necessarily make good actors, and Kurt's performance proves it. The rest of the cast isn't much better, and the script is dreadful. However, there are some fun moments in this film. The scene in the village of the lunatics is pretty bizarre, some of the extras are truly creepy-looking, and the sheer lunacy of the plot provides some good laughs. If you have ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a martial-arts film, watch this one."
5,"A bloody, action-packed thriller!","This movie had rich characters, both good and evil and the casting was great. So was the locations and the extras were quite humerous themselves. There was pretty real dialogue and visual effects. Kurt Thomas was great and he is my role model. Hats off to the director who made this movie and he should make a sequel."
5,IT DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!,YAKMALA! And with that one echoing word we're off and running through the streets of crazy town (complete with the palma horse at it's center) in the non-stop action fest that is Gymkata!This film has it all...Ninjas!Terrorists!Barbarians!Boat chases!Pre-chalked surfaces for our hero to spin around on!Bad acting!A dead pig!A cackling old lady!Punches!Kicks!A subtle plotline about the development and installation of an important American satellite (that is so subtle it needs to be addressed in a caption at the closing seconds of the movie)!Flips!Death sports!Cliff-diving!The answer to the age old question: What if a world class gymnast was also skilled in the ancient fighting arts?!80's hair!I could just go on-and-on but why bother! Why aren't you watching this movie by now? IT'S ON DVD FOR GOD'S SAKE!
4,"Knuckle sandwich, extra cheese.","I was going to wax poetic with an exhaustively-detailed written summary of my thoughts on this cinematic gem, but this guy did it so much better:[...]"
3,"very poorly done,but i've had more painful experiences","despite the fact that this film is pretty poorly done from from every every aspect you can think of,it's still manages to be a guilty pleasure.it comes off more as a Mel Brooks parody type of a movie than an actual serous attempt at film making,although it does try to take itself seriously,which of course makes it all the more funny.there are definitely a lot of eye rolling moments here.and yet,this is nowhere near as bad as many so called movies floating around out there.there's some entertainment value here,and it isn't all that painful to watch,relatively speaking.try Dark Town,or Dracula 3000,if you really want to know pain,and then get back to me.as for this one,i give it a 3/5"
3,Memories from childhood.,"I have been looking for this movie for a while now and found it by chance. I saw this when I was maybe 12 years old and always remembered it. Watching it again is never as good as when you were younger, but if anyone out there likes free running and martial arts this is a good movie for you."
4,A real action film!,"Like the best classics in the genre, better than ""Die Hard"" or the poor ""Terminator"", this film really shows how action movies should be made. Pay attention to the ""village of crazies"" scene, the most rewarding part of this masterpiece. It could have 5 stars, but it is too short. I can't wait for the second part. Hey Hollywood, you are missing a gold mine here! 70 dolars is a real bang for the buck for this excelent video. I only wish some day they will release it in DVD, that would make shine my player! Like a '68 Mustang, this is a classic everybody wants to own! Robert Clouse is the Picasso of movie directors! Enough said, buy this movie (I own three copies, including a japanese edition)."
1,Woeful martial arts movie with wooden acting !,"One of the worst of the genre...Kurt Thomas is about as thrilling to watch as paint drying !I think Kurt is back flipping burgers at McDonalds in Seattle !Bad plot, lousy script, stupid concept....and they are the film's assets !!Move on to something better from Jackie Chan !"
2,If you love Creme Brulee,"If you love creme brulee, then watching this is like eating dog turds wrapped in fig leaves.That's not to say this film doesn't have it's unique contributions to American culture. I can think of no other film that has both gymnastics, and a Balkan wearing a mask behind his head who moons the protagonist.Recommendation: watch this with a bottle of vodka. You can thank me later."
5,Yahk-Mallah!,"Mind-numbing fight scene coordination. Explosive action. Breathtaking locations. Intriguing story. Oscar worthy performances. What more could you ask for? Do yourself a favor and own this movie today. You've got to see to believe it. Yahk-Mallah!BTW, the famous ""voice-of-the-action-movie-preview"" guy delivers one of his most memorable performances that can be viewed/heard in the original theatrical trailer exclusively on this disc! ""His only weapon? Himself. And that's all he needs..."" Classic!"
5,An American Classic,"This could very well be one of the best movies ever made. I have grown up with it and think that it has probably made me a better person. In all seriousness though, I truly do enjoy this movie and find it very entertaining. It has an amazing plot that truly grips the viewer. This movie must not be overlooked by anyone who truly enjoys a well-made movie. Me and my friends like this movie so much that we had the poster hanging in our dorm room and know every word of the movie. This is all that I can say to support one of my favorite movies, and I hope you get a chance to watch it."
4,A total B movie!!!,Its not the best movie ever made..but if you like bad movies...those classic B movies then you will love this..
3,For the Movie Fanatic,Not as scary as I remembered it to be however good to have in a collection. Ingrid Bergman as always is wonderful.
5,One of the great ones!,"I've been waiting for this one on DVD for as long as I've had a DVD player. A true classic! One of George Cukor's best -- and he directed a lot of great movies! Based on the play, this taut drama brings us one of the great villians of all time. Boyer is not some scenery-chewing, soap-opera villian shouting and throwing tantrums. No, he's a soft, purring villian, a loving, concerned husband who is in truth driving his wife mad. She never looked better and Cotton is at his best. Check out the young Angela Landsbury too. Wonderful movie. I don't want to give it away. Just buy it -- you will not regret it!"
5,Gaslight,My students loved this classic suspense tale and used the information to write their own screenplays!
2,Disappointed,So I read all the reviews for this product and was so excited because I haven't been able to find the 1940 original gaslight anywhere! Imagine my disappointment when I watched this DVD and found that it had only the 1944 version. :( not happy. I gave this two stars because I enjoyed the Ingrid Bergman version. Still pissed...waste of money
5,Happy with DVD,"I purchased Gaslight as I am presently buying my all time favourite movies. The older movies far surpass most of the new movies made these days. Gaslight was gripping and entertaining from the beginning. Well acted by these legends of film. The picture and sound quality was great, clear and precise."
4,an original,"Angela Lansburys debut in films. Ingrid Bergman wasfantastic. A little slow in parts but a great movie if you like the actors in it. Black and white movies are so special and it really takes you to the time it was filmed.Great scenes of England .If you like original and old movies, this is a great one."
1,What is Warner Bros. thinking?,"Is Warner Bros. really releasing classic films like ""Gaslight"", ""Grand Hotel"", ""Mrs. Miniver"", ""Mutiny On The Bounty"" and ""The Great Ziegfeld"" in COLORIZED versions. What are they thinking?! These films were released in glorious black & white, which, along with the casting, direction, story, cinematography and editing, made these films classics. I can't imagine a studio with any sense of pride stooping so low as to release their classics in anything other than their orginal versions. If this is true, all I can say is I'm glad Warner Bros. isn't in charge of the Louvre. They'd probably recast the Mona Lisa with Britney Spears sporting a big, toothy grin. Smarten up, Warner Bros. I do not plan on buying any film that has been butchered like these films will be."
1,kj,the box says Ingrid Bergman and J Cotten. Its a lie. They are theiving from us. The box says it is Ingrid Bergman. How cna yoyu sell it as such when it is not her movie.
4,a matter of perspective,"Well, I beg to differ with the Amazon reviews. The thing that makes this extra creepy is that our young, uncertain heiress fully believes she can trust her new husband. As a matter of survival and love, she finds it impossible to believe any cruelty of him; it is less painful for her to accept her own insanity. The black and white media is used well here, and surely inspired Hitchcock......."
3,Pretty good old movie,This is a friend's favorite movie so I thought I would rent it. It was okay. Kind of slow. Definitely not my favorite.
4,Gaslight,"An old favorite, love a little mystery & suspense without bad language, politics or sexy scenes. I like taking-in all of the movie, the costumes, big old houses,etc. I watch movies for entertainment."
4,Review of The Six Messiahs,"The Six Messiahs, sequel to The List of Seven, follows the (fictional) fortunes of Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle and the man who provided the inspiration of the famous literary detective, Jack Sparks.I enjoyed this book just as much as the prequel, with in-depth and meaningful characterisation - some characters from the previous book return and new ones are created. There is a great combination of history, humour, fantasy and horror, along with some detailed information about the Kaballah faith.I found that the ending galloped to a sudden halt, however, and readers are advised to read The List of Seven first to get a better understanding of the characters in The Six Messiahs."
3,Doesn't live up to its prequel,"Not a bad book, but unfortunately most of the other characters are more interesting and play a more important role than the two main characters (A.C. Doyle and Jack ""Sherlock Holmes"" Sparks). If you liked the hints at real and fictional characters from ""The list of 7"", this book comes a little short in this respect, too."
3,"interesting but not the calibre of the ""7""","I enjoyed this book for the best part, but I found the ending left me kind of ""flat"". It seems he got 3/4 of the way through,got distracted and descided to rush the ending. It did not have the same impact as the prequil. All in all I would still recomend it, but I hope Frost can get back to the standard he set with "" the list of 7 """
2,You Know What They Say About Sequels,"I loved ""The List of 7"", but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment. The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story. It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. This is not a book I will read again."
3,An entertaining sequel,"Though not as grabbing as the first novel, The List of Seven, this is still an fun and entertaining read. With the assistance of 5 other fun characters, Conan and an ally from his past join forces to battle a growing evil. With characters such as ""the most dangerous man in the world"", Frost once again entertains the reader with some exciting personalities."
2,Too many characters,"I read this book and I thought it was good at first but there were so many characters that I would often forget who was who. After a while I had to write down which character was which because there are far too many of them and I was getting tired of having to go back in the book to find out who Frost was talking about. I have never in my life had to do that on any other book.The only thing I really enjoyed about the book was the Japanese man (I can't remember his name because it has been a year since I read it) because I am into the martial arts.Overall, I'd say it wasn't all that good. Don't buy it."
3,"Good, but not AS good","The List of 7 was such a fun read, I rushed right out and bought the sequal, The 6 Messiahs. I have to say that while Frost continues to be a good writer and settles well into his own narrative style, Messiahs just didn't live up to the expectations The List of 7 set up. Where List followed the life of Jack Sparks as the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes, Messiahs showcases a physically and spiritually deseased Sparks that causes the book to lose that Holmesesque quality. It's still a good read, and the ending was true to form and well done, even if it was a little short. If you read and enjoyed The List of 7, give this book a try. If you haven't, don't start with this book. It won't give you the full scope of Frost's talents."
3,An Ok Read,While I loved the List of Seven - this book is basically a retread of the first minus the charming personality of Jack Sparks. It seems he survives his demise - only to come back as a shell of his former self.If you love Sherlock Holmes spatiches with a little ooga-booga thrown in - this is probably your cup of tea.Not bad ... just not great.
3,Pretty fair reference book,"I bought this book to help with a rebuild of my Kobota D850/Universal M25. The book contained about ten pages on this specific engine. While somewhat helpful, this is no Chilton's or shop manual. If I had it to do over, a shop manual would have been more helpful."
2,A disappointament,Deals disappointingly little with the engine for which I had hoped to use it as a reference.
3,"mildly Entertaining, a little preposterous","Not your typical Resnick book. Some interesting characters and storylines, but the main character, the Oracle, was a poorly constructed 2 dimensional character that I really tired of after a couple of pages."
3,Super Reader,"Penelope is now a grown woman, and still causing consternation in the hierarchies of power, because her ability to see the future allows her to change things.The Iceman becomes involved, and he hires an agent, and a third agent also appears after the authorities decide that the Iceman's activities may not be in their best interests.Suddenly, you get a bunch of these people after the same woman at the same time."
5,A masterpiece of literary imagination!,"The extreme detail expressed throughout the book perfectly generates the aura of how a rebuilt post-apocolyptic world would be like. With the addition of an ever-present danger of an alien race now residing and controlling the population, the story-line holds the reader at seat's edge beyond just the pages of Oracle!"
5,cute book,"This is a really cute book. I learned about it probably 15 years ago from the tv show, Reading Rainbow."
2,"PLEASE, NO backup singers!!!!!!!","Lee Ann Womack is an awesome recording artist, but in her song, I Hope You Dance, the backup singers and vocals absolutely ruined that wonderful song. Lee Ann Womack does NOT NEED any backup singers!!!!! Some artists do, but NOT her!."
2,Disappointing...,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Ashes by Now""...love that song but the rest are boring. I was hoping there would be more songs like that on the CD. Most are slow, sleepy, depressing songs. She has a beautiful voice, which comes through on this CD, but that still doesn't making it worth listening to more than once."
4,Wo To Real Country,"Painted as one of the few Nashville singers who sings ""country"" music, Lee Ann Womack's third album sounds contemporary throughout a collection of songs dealing with a varied range of topics that adult listeners can identify with.But this isn't a twangy ""He left me and took everything ... What am I going to do?"" type of album. The title cut inspires everyone to make the most out of all of life's stages (maybe that's why it's played on so many radio stations: pop, country and easy listening).""Ashes By Now"" deals with (of course) getting burned in a relationship (over and over) and knowing you need to move on. Other highlights include the spunky I'm over you song ""I Feel Like I'm Forgetting Something"" and hoping love doesn't disappear in ""After I Fall."""
2,"yuck, more country lite.......","What a shame, the title track is wonderfull, with a great appearance by the Sons of the Desert. But for me the rest of the album smacks of ""lets see if I can get a crossover to AOR pop radio"". Unfortunate...Womack has a timeless country voice. I wish the compostions were a bit more authentic."
5,inspirational,"I recently purchased the cd ""I hope you dance"". I found the songs not only entertaining but inspirational. Each had there own message. The songs gave me new hope in that life is a journey and to go for your dreams, that you might get hurt along the way but it is worth the end results."
5,I really would recommend this album.,"I haven't heard all the songs on this album, I have heard a few though. The ones I have heard were very good. I especially like ""I Hope You Dance"". I think that song has a very good meaning. You have to listen to the words to really understand it, but when you do it's all worth it. Personally, I wouldn't care how much the CD cost for just that song. I think it was very heart felt and has a good point. This is definitely a song that I would want my kids to hear and understand when they get older."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this album just for the 'I Hope You Dance' song that I liked so much on the radio. I was very disappointed to find the song had been 'redone' with somebody called the Sons Of The Desert, whoever they are. It detracted so much from the original that I returned the album."
5,I Hope You Dance,"Great CD! There were a few songs I didn't love, but were ok, while the vast majority of the songs were great, not just the ones that have made the charts. She's really talented, and doesn't hide her voice behind a lot of percussion, plus you can understand her words, which are one of the best parts of her songs, next to her voice."
1,I Hope You Dance,"Mostly listening to pop and some rock, I've been listening to country music off and on. I liked the singer's voice and the lyrics to ""I Hope You Dance"" so I tried buying this CD. After listening to this CD for the first time, I started laughing; nearly all the songs were depressing. I've heard country music can be depressing but I didn't expect nearly the whole CD to be depressing. The title track is the only song I liked. (For comparison, I liked three songs from Kevin Sharp's Measure of a Man CD, my only other country CD)."
2,NOT MY FAVORITE LEE ANN CD,I have all 3 of Lee Ann's cd's and this one is not the best of those 3. It's much too slow and dragging. There's really only 1 up tempo song the rest will put you to sleep. I think her very 1st cd is still her best
1,It's too bad!,"""Never Again, Again,"" Lee Ann Womack's first hit single, cut through the pop mush usually played on so-called country radio like a hot knife through butter. Here, I said to myself on first hearing it, is a woman who understands where country music came from, and wants to keep that traditional sound alive. Her first two CDs generally reinforced my opinion.Unfortunately, I must agree with John Morthland's review for Amazon.com of ""I Hope You Dance."" Lee Ann has been ""de-twanged"" in this collection of songs, both in her vocals and in the songs' arrangements. Fiddles have given way to violins. She's gone pop, and from her manifesto in the liner notes, I doubt if she'll ever return to the hardcore country sound.Yes, this is a well-written, well-crafted, well-produced, well-sung record--but it's a pop record. If you were attracted to Lee Ann, like I was, by her seemingly deep country roots, you'll be bitterly disappointed.It's too bad!"
2,Lee Ann.........Reconsider!!!!!!!,"How's the line go? ""When you come close to sellin out reconsider"". Well Lee Ann should have reconsidered. I was a huge Lee Ann Womack fan. All I heard her talk about was how she wanted to stay true to country music. SHE SOLD OUT!! This is CITY music, not country. With the exception of ""I feel like I'm forgetting something"", there are very few songs that I consider real country on this album. They are all too pretty. I love the way Lee Ann sings true country so this album was very dissapointing to me. I know Lee Ann will sell more albums this way, but she will do it by selling out and not staying true to country music. Please Lee Ann, on the next album; don't let your producer and record label talk you into selling out again. Your voice is made for traditional country. Please don't rob us of that."
4,Womack creates a country classic.....,"Lee Ann Womack's I HOPE YOU DANCE is exactly what country music has been needed the last few years. A innovative album, it is filled with creative musical expression, thoughtful uncliched lyrics (as country music lyrics usually are), and displays incredible song writing talent. The crowning achievement of the album is the title track. ""I Hope You Dance"" is for anyone needing a lift-me-up or inspiration to get back on track. It's a song for family, friends, and especially since it is that time of year, for graduating Seniors; its words of wisdom should be guidelines for any student stepping out into the world. It should be at the top of your list of songs to commemorate Graduation."
2,One Great Song,"The title song of this album is one of the best works of the year; I expect to be listening to it well into the future. But I was very disappointed with the album; the title song was almost the only thing I liked in the whole record. Even the musical style of the rest of the album was different. My experience has usually been that, if I like a song, I'll find other gems on the album. You may be different, but for me a single would have been enough."
2,Not What I Expected,"After listening to the title song on the radio for weeks, I decided to purchase this CD. I really liked ""I Hope You Dance"". What a disapointment it was when I first played the CD. The title song on the CD is VERY different from the song on the radio. The radio version is very hip and non-country. The CD version is VERY ""country-fied"". Complete with many ""twangs"". I only played it twice and sold it to a used CD store. A classic case of ""Bait and Switch""."
1,WHAT IS THIS!?,"Lee Ann Womack should be ashamed of herself. After promising to stay true to country music in the inspiring ""Murder On Music Row"" that she performed with Alan Jackson and George Strait, what does she do? She goes out and records a POP album of all things. I'm sorry but there's little difference between her and Faith Hill or Shania Twain now. And have you seen her new video for ""Ashes By Now""? It's DISGRACEFUL. She's obviously more interested in selling her body just like Faith and Shania. I nearly got sick watching her dance around in skimpy,tight outfits. I hope she's enjoyed ""selling out"" because she obviously didn't ""reconsider"". She needs to live by her own words. In my opinion she has committed ""murder on music row"" just like the rest of them."
1,I hope you don't dance,This CD was horrible! I couldn't stand it. I tried looking for a good song on it but apparently there is none! DO NOT BUY IT!!!
3,Leeann Womack is supporting George W. Bush,"Leeann Womack has thrown her support behind George Bush. (...)She has surely hereby sacrificed a large portion of her buying public - perhaps she doesn't care or is unaware of this fact, but she does not have the same all-white, all-Southern, testosterone-fuelled audience as the male Country stars who have come out for Bush. They don't have to worry, their fans are die-hard Republicans.I welcome her honesty, but it does mean I won't be buying anything she does from now on. (...)Who else will join the boycott and let Lee Ann hear the voice of her fans?"
2,Third Effort Falls Flat,"What a disappointment. After two albums of genuine heartfelt music, Lee Ann puts out a cookie cutter hat act album. Same-o, same-o and a big yawn. If you want to hear a country singer still with an edge, try either of Neko Case's excellent albums; or, of course, stick with Lee Ann's first two..."
5,Amazing Voice in Country Music!,"Lee Ann Womack is a great country and adult contemporary vocalist. She did a good job on her ""I Hope You Dance"" CD.My favorite tracks are of course ""I Hope You Dance,"" ""Why they call it falling,"" ""Does my Ring burn your finger,"" ""Stronger than I Am,"" ""I feel like I'm forgetting Something"" and lastly, but not least ""Lord I Hope this Day is Good."" She has a very lilting voice and let's face it, she is the heir to country legend Dolly Parton. The baton is passed to her and she sure is making us country fans proud, keep it up Lee Ann! Best of luck in your career and future. Keep entertaining us!"
2,Womack contracts Faith Hill Disease,"For those who loved Womack's first two albums, this one is a shock to the system -- an apparent attempt to trade in the neo-traditionalism that exploded Womack onto the country scene. In its place are smooth pop/alt arrangements with all the edges sanded down, lively and nice but sliding right past the ears. The few obviously country tracks are grouped in a ghetto at the end of the CD, starting at track #9, like someone was ashamed of them. Still, Womack has a magnificent voice, and the high concept title track (with Sons of the Desert) is possibly the year's best song; it could make up for the rest of the record. There are a few good moments, like the acoustic-based opener ""The Healing Kind,"" but overall I Hope You Dance is a deep disappointment."
3,Too Much Formula,"Considering that Lee Ann has been around for a few years now, this album is deemed to be her breakthrough hit. Sadly, despite the wonderful and moving ""I hope you dance"", she seems to have been pidgeonholed with so many other up and coming female stars, as to releasing ""what sells"", instead of exploring her own creative talents. Not knowing whether to be country, new country or country pop - one could easily close there eyes, and mistake most of the songs herein for anyone of her peers. Despite her wonderful vocal range, something gets lost in the shelf wrapped collection of mundane and flat songs on the album. A great pity, after a single release that promised so much more."
1,NEVER RECEIVED!,"Negative Stars!!! Completely dissappointed. Made this order for a gift. Not only did the birthday come and go, but it's a month later and still no product. Sadly, I learned my lesson and will not be doing this again. I hope the seller will at least refund me for a product purchase I've never received."
5,Welcome Back!,"This album brings me right back to the kitchen in the Bronx, where my mother had a small, white radio,sitting on a shelf, tuned to Arthur Godfrey's program. I loved listening to that show, while eating breakfast. I recall many of the songs that are on this CD!"
4,Lonely Petunia,"Am I alone in the onion patch? Why isn't one of Mr Godfrey's most evocative tunes present on this - or any - available CD collection. Please, somebody in the business get your act together - gives us I'm A Lonely Petunia In An Onion Patch (fee-yew!)."
4,As tough as they get,"I decided to purchase this Computer brief based on the one I had from the same manufacturer.These are made with excellent quality material and a well thought out distribution of pockets, folders etc... The onlyimprovement point would be to add reinforced stitching (specially on the zippers) so as to further ad to the working life of these briefs.I used mine for two years of business school on a very though schedule and one year of work after that.I would certainly recommend you get this one.Last, avoid the standard Staples and Office Depots as they are a good 30% more expensive on these retailers."
4,Great Laptop Bag,"I got this bag for X'smas. It has plenty of space for the laptop, accessories, and a gusset for documents. It is light and good looking. I really like this bag and highly recommend it. Great bag for the price!"
3,Soo heavy,"Really heavy, had back pains just for a notebook and a macbook pro 13 inch and the stitching kept coming apart"
2,Shaper,"When trying on this body shaper it was comfortable but being a BBW there was NO support. Was like putting on a comfy pair of undies. Being larger through the middle, the high top would roll when sitting. Had to return the item."
2,Half-Baked!,"Vaada Raha' is all about Hope and Believe. Bobby stars as Duke, who's life today can be called gratifying. Everything works on his advantage. But in a unfortunate accident, he loses everything, be it physically & mentally. He becomes a negative pile, until, a kid enters his life and returns him what he had lost - HOPE.Vaada Raha' has it's share moments, and a power-packed performance by Bobby, but overall, this comes out as a half-baked venture. The film begins well, but becomes a bore in the most vital moments, it's culmination. It's far from being touchy, it in fact is depressing.What stands tall in 'Vaada Raha' is undoubtedly, Bobby's power-packed performance.On the whole, watch this one for Bobby's work, as that's the only substantial plus in this film!"
4,"Make sure you have usb 2.0 for 24x speed, or it will be 6x !","A wonderful cool looking device that immediately worked under Linux. Only problem: Most computers (such as my notebook purchased last year) do not have a usb 2.0 port. The drive also works with the old usb 1.1, but will only run at a speed of 6x instead of 24x.So you will have to buy a usb 2.0 port card in addition to this drive. Apart from that it would be 5 out of 5 stars:The buffer-underrun-protection works wonderfully, and that it can play mp3 cds without the computer being connected is just another plus.Linux 2.4.19 will have usb 2.0 drivers included, they are already in the 2.4.19pre3 code.MichaelPS: Windows XP worked also, but Linux is just better ;-)"
3,Documentation for software very poor,"It was simple to burn an audio CD but burning image files (my primary need)was another story entirely. The user manual on the supplied Nero software disk is far to complicated. The instructions in the Help index were useless.I finally got a hold of Yamaha customer support (only open 9-5)and they were helpful. The solutions were simple, just not explained. I was up and running after a short time.Now it works really well. Just don't rely on the enclosed documentation."
3,Line of Forts,This book is exactly what it claims to be. I have skimmed it a bit and will save it for when my curiosity is totally piqued.I wanted to find out more about Colrain where my grandmother grew up in the late 1800s and this is more factual than what I enjoy. But the author didn't claim that it was anything other than what it is.
4,Chanel Bath Gel,"Good but maybe could be better.Chanel products are usually superior in smoothness and this is average good. Considering the cost, I had hoped for more."
3,Not her Best,"This is a compilation of Billie's last years, and it only includes tracks recorded from Verve. Unfortunately, these are not even her best tracks from that period! Absolute classics, like 'Autumm in New York' and 'Baby Ant I good to you' are missing. Get Billie's work from Columbia, Decca and Commodore before getting into Verve."
5,Hoppy Converter,"It worked great! Amazon had the lowest price anywhere and included shipping. I went to all other local auto parts stores and they all had to order it and wanted more money. Unit was easy to install and seems to work fine. I used this on my Harley Road KIng. I originally bought high priced components from a motorcycle specific store for my trailer connection. Those cost over $150 and burnt out within a short time. This Hoppy unit was much cheaper, easier to install and looks much more rugged. Working great so far and I am very impressed with Amazon. Great buy!"
5,Regardless of where you are in the Aubrey/Maturin series read this book,"This is THE book to read before one reads, or even while you are reading, the Aubrey/Maturin series. Although a it is a great story; it is, in a way, a good primer for the A/M series, explaining some of the nautical evolutions that take place on the ships of the time. At times more useful than A SEA OF WORDS ( which still need much more work)In particular, I enjoy having the map of the entire voyage included in the front so that I can follow things. My only complaint is that I wish that it (the map) were on more pages, hence each section larger, so that one could read it better."
4,Body Language in Negotiations & Sales,This is definitely a good read for anyone who has just got into sales and also an eye-opener for those who already are.
4,Good item ! a must for shooters !,This is something all shooters would need if you want to compete seriously..Very simple to setup/operate.. very light and durable.
2,Me quede aterrada con ese final,"Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza. No es que no me haya gustado, si me gusto, pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado. Me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues. Se habra quedado con tao'chien? se habra reconciliado con Miss Rose? Eso nunca lo vamos a saber!"
3,"Entretenido, pero el final es una decepcion.","Me entretuve mucho leyendo acerca de Valparaiso y California del siglo pasado. A esta historia, en todo caso, le falto esa chispa de genialidad que se aprecia en otros libros de Allende. Especialmente al final de la novela, me parecio que la autora tuvo que terminar el relato repentinamente. El final es una decepcion."
5,Un placer leerla.,"Isabel Allende con su talento natural de un mundo real y fantastico describe la aventura maravillosa de Eliza, su personaje es el clasico personaje femenino de Allende, donde el elemento principal es el amor por la vida. Otra vez los mundos magicos de Allende se entretejen con tanta delicadeza, incluyendo espiritus orientales, bandidos, marineros, y gente de sociedad. Su narracion de la fiebre de oro en California al lado de la personaje es tan fina y llena de aventuras y magia. EL final de la novela deja una chispa de esperanza para un amor que se fue formando a partir de la amistad y camaraderia entre dos almas muy similares que se encuentran separados por razas. Es un placer leer a Allende."
4,"Her best since House of the Spirits, however...","What happened to the ending? Was the author struck by lightening before she could finish?A wonderful story, beautifully written with a marvelous evocation of San Francisco during the gold rush era. A strong, fascinating central character, but does she reunite with her family at the end? The abruptness of the ending made me howl with frustration."
2,"Bad, Bad, bad......","Esta es quiza la peor novela que Isabel Allende a escrito asta ahora. Los personajes carecen de caracter y ""vida"" propia. La manera en que Allende narra la historia es muy entretenidad, pero despues de leer unas cuantas paginas, te das cuenta que esta novela no tienen ninguno de los ingredientes a los que Allende nos tiene acostrunbrados."
2,"""Hija"" es peor que sus otras obras","Ademas de los personajes fuertes, el enfoque sobre el choque de las culturas y los detalles riquisimos sobre la vida en Chile, China y California, tendria que decir que no vale la pena de leer esta novela. Allende ha escrito y, seguramente, va a seguir escribiendo obras clasicas y inteligentes pero ""Hija"" debe de estar olvidado. Cuando la autora visito a Seattle para presentar esta novela yo le pregunte por que su obra termino asi--casi sin desarollo del trama. Ella me dijo que si ella hubiera terminado la novela se la convertiria en una mera novela de romance. Temo que ""Hija"" ya es una mera novela de romance."
5,"Captivating, breath-taking story","I absolutely loved this book. Allende takes us through a fabulous journey through the young eyes of this amazing woman, Eliza Sommers. Eliza is courageous, adventurous and full of life. I found the background on the Gold Rush and the early years of California fascinating. Even though the end leaves you wondering some things, it is parallel to what the book is all about -- the world out there which is unknown to all of us. Beautiful piece of work. I highly recommend it."
3,interesting,"Not one of Allende's best efforts, however I still found the novel interesting to read. Set in Chile, China, and California between 1843 and 1853, it is an interesting mix of historical fiction; a social commentary on the British of the day; a look at prejudices in the USA; a glimpse into the chinese culture; and relationships which have gone awry. Alot of ground to cover in one novel, however Allende's talent for storytelling ties all the elements toghether in an easy to read fashion which make for an enjoyable novel. As always, her strong female characters and matriarchial family structure is present. Hija de la Fortuna is a lighter read than her other novels, and very recommendable."
2,no es tan buena,"Esta novela es entretenida, pero definitivamente no es el mejor trabajo de Isabel Allende. El final no deja mucho que decir. Mi recomendación es que lean otras novelas de Isabel Allende, como ""La Casa de los Espiritus"", que es mucho mejor que ésta."
4,A Classic!,This volume makes a valiant effort of treating the Greek while at the same time pointing to the Hebrew. I love this approach; so Stephen Renn and Bill Mounce has both utilize this historic approach. But kudoes for Abbott-Smith! Still useful!
5,"Grace and wisdom but, most of all, a superb story","I read ""Burning Marquerite"" when it first came out. I was astounded, and so gratified I could barely stand it. This novel addresses intimate parts of the human experience and does it with grace, wisdom and controlled eloquence.The geographic reach of the story adds to its appeal, from New England to New Orleans, secrets and love are held close but held fast. There's so much in this novel to satisfy -- a rare blend of exquisite story and just-restrained language. This novel is truly finest kind."
5,You should read this book,"This is a wonderful read, haunting, heartbreaking and uplifting. The author's crisp, sparse prose is captivating and compelling. Marguerite is such a complex, multi-layered character, at times your'e not sure whether to love her or hate her. When her secrets are ultimately revealed, her true motives of devotion and love shine through. A great choice for a book club that I highly recommend."
4,"Nice, easy read...","I really enjoyed this book! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a interesting, well written book that is not too complex, and easy to get through. Perfect summer reading."
4,"Great product , great service and good price.",It was pleasure to do business and get this product. It came in a timely manner with all it was supposed to. I checked it out and it is working well.
2,Nice display but thats it!! Look Elsewhere,"Got the 615C last June, '02. So far the latch for the cover has broken and won't stay attached. The stylus keeps slipping out - I've lost 2 already. The battery won't stay charged and the PDA orange light flickers when in the cradle. For the price, I should have looked at the Palm brand more closely. Had a IIIxe and was happy except for the display. The display on the Sony is the best out there, hence my purchase. But never again. For the price, the reliability is very poor after 6 months. By the way I have an aluminum case for the unit (after the factory cover broke), it's never been dropped or abused. Probably would have lasted a few hours with some abuse. No more Sony - it's Baloney."
1,did I have a lemon?,"I have been a long time palm user....wanted the color, so went with Sony. Short battery life, power button in a bad place, turned on ""by itself"", and died frequently, poor instructions, and then the backlite died. Would certainly not buy again."
3,Read the small print first,"This Clie will not run on Windows 95 or NT! It looks cool to be able to show friends photos on my PDA but I can't run it on my office computer. It doesn't look so cool having to constantly tap on the PDA screen for numbers, etc."
1,defect merchandise,"i purchased a sony clie pegt615 on 08-15-02 at compusa/madisonWi. I found that it didn't beam and took it back for an exchange model, same item only to find that this one didn't beam either. (the technician at the store confirmed the defect). i decided to reverse the purchase for cash. on our way out ot the store we found that the display model had the same defect.this tok a hunk of time out of our short vacation unfortunately not with a happy ending.angie siewert"
4,product beats palm; service lags behind,"Have owned a Palm V, Vx, and m505; the 505 died and replaced it with a Clie due to smaller size, brighter screen.For size and features, the Clie is the obvious winner--I would reccommend it to any savvy PDA user (an aside: Data migration from an old to new Palm OS based system is a cinch)For a neophyte PDA user...I'd buy a Palm. Their service/support wins hands down, with fast and usable information. Sony support is slow to nonexistent (didn't respond twice), and their info was often incomplete or missed the mark completely."
3,Stylus and form,"Overall this clie is a good LOW-end device. There is going to be shadow on the screen somewhere which I find quite distracting. As well, if you keep taking your stylus in and out, in a week or two, your stylus will simply fly out if you pick up your clie too fast. Also, the back sticker with your barcode and serial will fade out really fast if you don't tape it first. The battery time is also ridiculous, about 2-3 hours MAX. Other than those cons, everything is all good(other than speed...cause its quite slow)"
4,This is a GREAT Palm device,"I owned the Clie 610 and upgraded to the 615 because of the new form factor. This handheld has the best display, period--320x320. The migration from the old Palm to the new was effortless, but you do have to know how to do it. The only downsides are 1) no native Mac support and 2) USB only, so if you're running either Win95 or NT you're out of luck.One other observation is that the screen and writing surface seem more prone to scratches than the Palm family, but that statement is based strictly on anecdotal evidence.Other than those points, this is one sexy device."
2,Screen problems,"On my first unit, the screen backlight burned out within two weeks; the second one would not display anything after 5 days. Both were replaced cheerfully; but after the second, I decided, rashly, to migrate to a Compaq Ipaq 3800 series.I still miss the Clie 615, though--it was easy to have around, more accessible, with a well-integrated software package. The Ipaq exposes one to the Microsoft morass of incompatibilities and inexplicable freezes and shutdowns (my Ipaq right now will not display any images at all--despite the fact that I have limited memory use to a minimum).Knowing Sony, theyt will solve the screen/display problem, and then the 615 will be perfect."
2,be careful,"be very careful. I have a sony clie and it broke 2 months after i got it. is started getting white spots under the screen, then the digitizer was going crazy and I had to reset it after 5 min of use. I then put it in my pocket and walked to my room and the screen broke. why do they call them pocket Pc's if you cant put them in your pocket with out them breaking? and be aware that I took very good care of it. It was a waste of [price]."
5,Cool title!,"First Edition, with Original Broadway cast of William Hurt, Nancy Snyder and Jeff Daniels! Also includes slightly later case, starring Christopher Reeve. In the usual playbook format, with bright red covers, of course."
5,Ocean Colour Me More,"O.C.S. is one of those bands that seem to grow with each recording, often misaligned by the press, the band pulls another facet of their unique mix of 60's retro, and rock. The vocal are superb, and the music crisp with something for everyone. Even as a discovery album, this will open a few eyes and hearts to the band, yes there are a couple of tracks here that I dont like.... but on the whole the album is a well crafted one, reflecting all of the bands talents....... Shes Been Writing, The Song goes on, North Alantic Drift, Make The Deal. Stand out for me anyway. Yes its a import for the US, but worth it in my opinion $$ well spent. In the meanwhile Im off to play the other OCS albums I have, Very Very Very Loud."
2,Leaks Sand,"As soon as I took this item out of the packaging and gave it a few kicks it started leaking sand. I was really disappointed because besides from that, it seems to be a high quality footbag."
3,You only get ONE!,"You only get ONE (1). Don't be misled by the advertising - it clearly makes it seem like you're getting several. They're also disappointingly small, though I purchased mine intending to use them ('it' apparently) for juggling."
1,NEVER GET WHAT I ORDER,every time I pick a sand bag for my grandson they never send what I pick.I liked the one there showing so I picked it and they sent me an ugly brown one.They did that on the order before but I thought it was a fluke so I ordered again and the same darn thing happened.
5,Best hacky sack I've ever used,"My friend got one of these a couple of weeks ago, I liked it so much that I just ordered one for myself. This bag is a bit larger than other hacky sacks I've used. At first I was a little unsure about that, and the weight also. It is substantially heavier than other hacky sacks. But that's what makes this one so much better. Its size and weight put together allow for really great control, and after using this and grabbing my other (much lighter and smaller) hacky sack, I found myself hitting it too hard, and it would just flop around all over the place. Once you play with this for a little while, you will really like it and probably won't want to use any other type of hacky sack again."
2,Fun... for a While,"I've only used a few footbags and sand tends to be my favorite. This one doesn't disappoint.However after about an hour of use, a significant amount of sand has been taken out of the footbag. We would do simple kicks and you can see sand puffs fly out of the bag. It may be a defective bag that I have, but the sand drains REAL quick."
5,Great Magazine,We love this magazine. My husband and I are planning a move to Maine and this magazine is a fun read for us.
5,creature comforts 2nd season,Creature Comforts 2nd Season--I love these guys---got one for me and Christmas gifts for lucky family and friends and even as baby shower gift
3,CC 2nd Season,Doesn't appear to be as humorous as the 1st season. Has new characters and still quite well done but the (laughter) value is just not quite there this time. For fans only.
2,Not Aardman's finest work. . .,"After purchasing all of the ""Wallace And Gromit"" movies, all of the ""Shaun The Sheep movies,"" and ""Chicken Run"", et al., I was completely unprepared for the blasé presentation in the two ""Creature Comfort"" movies I bought. Of all the situations that were presented, I do not recall ever being moved to laughter. Albeit I am 71 years old, I think I still have the good sense to laugh when I am provoked to do so. Put your money into the Shaun flock instead."
2,NOT VERY GOOD!!,not very good and does NOT contain the Christmas Special (which is apparently the only funny episode) Please avoid this movie unless you absolutely have to!!
3,haven't watched it yet,I haven't watched this yet. (Bought it for a Christmas present fgor my wife who is a big fan and who enjoyed the 1st season - and is in love with the feature films). Just wanted to point out that it includes Creature comforts Merry Christmas Everybody so don't buy both as I did.
1,You get what you pay for,"I was thrilled to find the Durable product for such a low price; unfortunately, it is simply not stable or well-balanced. The item, weighing just over 3 pounds, will not stay upright even when not being used. Pay a little more and get a product that weighs a bit more. You will enjoy not having the lil bugger crash on your desk every minute or so."
5,An under-appreciated masterpiece,"Antar is a grossly under-appreciated masterpiece, somewhat in the vein of Scheherazade. No, it's not quite as great as Scheherazade -- but then few compositions are. But Antar is close and should appeal to virtually everyone who loves Scheherazade. Svetlanov is an outstanding conductor of Russian music and does a superb job in this recording. If you love great Russian music, please treat yourself to this recording."
1,Very Disappointed,"When i saw the description as static cling, I thought you would stick it on the outside of your window. This cannot be be seen through tinted windows from the inside."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this book...,"Even though it contains much more material than the 70-081 exam covers, it was nice to see every thing in one package. The only lapse in the book was diaster recovery (specifically, when/how to restore mailboxes and servers). These were the only questions that I could not answer from the book, so I only made a 900/1000.Good luck on your exams too!"
5,excellent book for exam preparation,"If you want to pass Exchange 5.5 exam, buy this book. Questions on the MS test are the same like review questions in the book. The book covers main aspects of Exchange server and probably can be nicely used in server administration and maintenance.Only what the book needs is more pictures exctracted from program (admin) and step by step guides."
3,Good book - Not so good,This book is great but lacks one essential element. The answers to the questions does not list an explanation or the page where the information can be found. All it tells you is what the correct answer is.
5,Get this to Pass Exchange Exam,"If you read this book very thoroughly, you will pass the exam. The CDs are very, very helpful in preparing you for the exam. Don't waste your time with the others, buy this one.Not for beginner's or people without basic Exchange knowlege."
3,"Good, but some problems . . .","Strengths: This book explains Exchange Server 5.5 in a way that is succinct and easy to read. Many of the practice questions are difficult and challenge your mastery of the material.Weaknesses: There aren't enough step-by-step descriptions of how to perform important tasks. The book glosses over a number of important details about Exchange Server and its clients, making its coverage superficial in some respects. Some of the practice questions can't be answered without prior hands-on experience (i.e., the information in the book is inadequate).Bottom line: If you have plenty of experience with Exchange Server, this book is probably adequate preparation for the test. However, if you have never used Exchange Server before, this book might not be enough to prepare you -- you might want to look at getting the Microsoft Training Kit as well, or Tony Redmond's book."
4,"Overall, a very good reference!","I bought this book, read it, and passed the exam. It was that simple. The only thing that I did not like is - this book is just too wordy. Many things in it could have been said in a much simpler way than they are. It is kind of confusing at times. However, I think it is a very good reference for an Exchange Administrator. It will get you through the exam - and that is what you want if you are buying, right?"
4,Good book with detail information,"This study guide not only lets me pass the exchange 5.5 exam, but she provides a very useful information about the exchange 5.5 in which I can't find from other MCSE books. I quite enjoy to study the chapter 12 ( Managing an exchange Environment) and chapter 16 (Migrating to exchange). Whatever you choose this book for exam or knowledge, that's a good choice."
4,GOOD BOOK BUT THE TEST HAS CHANGED!!!!,"This is a really good book for learning exchange but not necessarily passing the test anymore. The questions on the test are no longer a reflection of the review questions. If the test questions would only cover the material we would be fine, but they always have to come up with strange, poorly worded questions for the exam. I guess I should have taken this test before it changed but too late now...good luck to everyone."
5,Leaves you well prepared for the exam...,I thought this book was an excellent preparation guide for the actual exam. I don't think I ran across any topics that were not covered. I highly reccomend this book.
5,Eric meets Sandoz,"What a great album. Eric has re-invented himself. The title says it all. Eric goes thru a total transformation here, no longer the screamin Geordie, but a more introspective Eric. He's letting the music speak for him. This album was put out in 1967, right around the time of Sgt. Peppers. Eric could have shelved it in fear like Brian Wilson did with the Beach Boys newest album, but this album is just as good as Sgt. More into psychodelia, but still mixed in with some blues, Gregorian chant, and a rousing tribute to his new close friend ,Jimi Hendrix. He gives tributes to his musical idols, and at the same time introduces us to some very impressive new visions. Check out Man Woman, and tell me this guy cant sing all types of music in one album, and pull it off perfectly."
4,This captures a momement for me....,"Lately, I've used this album to explain to some of my youngerfriends what the times were like when I was young. The album justspeaks to me."
2,Airport lounge bookstore novel which did the trick,"'Spin' is not a good book in a literary sense, but it fulfils the need for a compelling read when you are trapped with a plastic tray in front of your knees at 30,000 feet.The story was suitably lurid, the narrative fast-paced, and the plot overly ambitious and somewhat unbelievable. The resulting combination therefore did the trick one dull weekend. It worked for me.For connoisseurs of the airport lounge bookstore novel, this is certainly not in the ranks of Michael Crichton or John Grisham, but it certainly does work well in that genre, and I didn't close the last page feeling that I had wasted the time I was trying to waste."
5,Soccer Goal,"My kids( 5,3 and 2) love playing soccer with this goal. You can assemble in a few minutes. My kids aren't strong kickers so I don't know about it tipping over. My husband kicked into it a couple of time and all it did was move back a little. I would differently recommend it for beginners."
4,horrible,"This is a great thing if you like a frequently broken thing, which comeswith some cheap extra stuff."
5,Epic Winning!,"I saw this on the history channel & had to get it. It's the best documentary I've seen on the Pacific War, The graphics are a little lame, but still puts you in the battle. Plus its cheap for blue ray, definitely gotta get it if you like war documentaries"
5,Enterprise,"This is the movie to buy if your a history buff, or just like war movies. OK, they do go a little over board on the animation, and I wish it was a little more detailed, I'd buy an expanded version if they made it. I recommend this movie, I got it on Amazon for $21, think it was a gold box but I'm forgetful. Wait for it to come back down to$21, which it dose every so many weeks. Its the same version as that, which was on television last year. You can tape it off the air but, it will take 8 or 9 weeks, you will have to sit and take out the commercials, and when your done, you will probably be like me and just want a good master copy, pay the $21 its worth it.I watched it last year on TV, and now twice since I received it. Now my son is watching it."
4,Educational,"History channel stuff is not very well done--too much loud music, and too much repetition. They jump around too much as if to say: ""Your attention span is short, people, so we are going to jump from interview to interview, and meanwhile bang on buckets and drums in the background to keep you awake.""The video is full of artificially pasted-on lines and squiggles to make it look old, and the aspect ratio is way too distorted from scene to scene.But even with all that, the many chapters present details about these WW2 battles, and tell the stories of the various people involved very well.I gave it four stars."
2,almost unwatchable,"The whole show has this weird compass and chart text overlay pattern moving and zooming over all the real film scenes like a kaleidascope. As if you have to tell people they are real and old film clips as opposed to the cartoon recreation animationsthat make up the other half of the vido.. duh and really annoying flashes of 3-2-1 old movie end trailers like the film just ran out, lame lame lame. It hurts your eyes and makes you seasick.I would give it zero or one star but it has a FEW redeeming values, such as pretty good accuracy and the real film clips are ""usually"" from the battles they are talking about (but not always.)"
4,"Great story, but very biased","Although I love all things History Channel related, this show is extremely biased towards the American account of the Pacific theater of WWII. As much as I was thrilled to see Japanese ships go up in flames, it was pretty interesting how they portrayed even the smallest American loss as a great tragedy but brushed over the deaths of thousands of Japanese sailors. Great show though."
4,The Big E,"I actually found the Battle 360 USS Enterprise quite good in the fact that it was extrodinarily detailed in describing the full gamit of the warfighting history of the Aircraft carrier the USS Enterprise. The use of CGI blended well with documented portions of the script as well as individual dialog from the parcipitants involed. The history of The Big E is practically the entire history of the war against Japan,well done.I am looking forward to further adventures with Battle 360."
2,"Good Show, Disappointing DVD Set","I'll save space and say that I agree with the other posts that laud the show for it's quality and usefulness.Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But, just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century."
5,"Battle 360, The Enterprise","In the style of a documentary, this shows (in detail) all of the battles the USS Enterprise went through from the bombing of Pearl Harbor to the end of WWII. There are a lot of very interesting interviews from men who served on her as well as actual footage."
4,Battle 360 season #1,"I've enjoyed the whole season and my only complaint isn't so much with what it presents but rather what it doesn't present. We certainly made blunders and didn't have the battle experience of the Japanese in the beginning. The quality of our torpedo's left a lot to be desired.(The controversies of the war are not shown maybe they are right.) I wish it showed more, that generation was simply amazing far beyond our widest dreams but there was racism in their too all the foibles of man and despite it they ended it in a charitable way. I am in awe of that generation even knowing their humanity warts and all. Doug Johnson"
4,A beautifull bittersweet voice,"The voice of Dinah is, as said in the booklet, ""hard and bittersweet"", at the opposite side from Sarah Vaughan... but very attaching. This a ""one day"" session, but a perfect recording."
2,"Great Features, Poorly built","Bought the Yepp 700 online exactly a year ago, and it is now broken. The battery case will not shut. (This has happened to many other customers. BUYER BEWARE.)However, the mp3 player does have nice features.-Good Sized Memory256 mb is alot of storage. You can get about 70 songs with that. Buy the media card. It's cheap.-Slick lookingThe yepp is very nice looking. It is also pretty small. Good to exercise with.-Remote controlIts nice that they put this here, but it is pretty worthless. The LCD is wothless, and the FM tuner on this is EXTREMELY WEAK!- Voice RecorderGood feature.In summary, nice features, but poorly built. If you want to take a chance on the mp3 player, go right ahead."
2,Looks great but not doesn't perform so great,"The case is gorgeous but so easy to scratch. The FM tuner quality was horrible. It was like listening to internet radio with all the static. The Audio manager was annoying to handle, impractical. There were bugs in the program which stopped me from listening to all of my songs. You also have to pay for the program if you want to transfer songs from a CD (even mp3 ripped CDs) to the player. Samsung would have gladly attempted to fix the problem but I just had enuff."
2,"Product great, software horrible","It's got great size and sound but the software is to difficult to understand, almost returned it.It took me 4 hours to compress and load my player with 50 songs"
1,The player is great - if you get it to work at all,"I bought one and was all excited about it. Unfortunately, I was never able to get the thing to work properly. The software it comes with is really, really lousy to begin with. Bad doesn't just mean it is hard to use. It means it crashes in the middle of downloading to the player very, very often. You HAVE to use the software they give you as far as I could tell. One time it downloaded an MP3 and it crashed the player so that it wouldn't start-up properly anymore (it would hang as soon as it'd turn on). I've given up and returned the item. It's too bad because the player's design is super nice."
4,Good player Bad design of remote,1 Remote controller is badest design .FM work not good.2Rechargeable battery only work 8 Hrs....
2,"Looks nice, but it's badly designed","Pros:The music sounds great and the amount of storage is sizable enough that you don't need to update/change the tracks frequently. The metal casing is very stylish and the dual use as a audio recorder really helps (ie. college lectures)Cons:The software is difficult to use because it collects a ""database"" of music by scanning your hard drive. Music can't be uploaded until the mp3 is in the database. If you're like me and download new music all the time, it becomes a hassle to update the database. The leather carrying case isn't designed well for headphones. The auxillary battery hangs on the edge and is a bit awkward.OVERALL:It's a good mp3 player if you're not going to walk around with it. Definitely NOT designed for athletic activity. Mine broke after 7 months (as many people have cited similar complaints). Consider the new smaller Mp3 players if you're an active person, or just wait and hopefully Samsung will come out with an improved version"
5,One Of the Best Players I Have Ever Had,"I got this player a while ago, I am very pleased with the result. I love it, it has tones of storage and theyn also have another version which holds 192mb instead of 128mb. If you have songs that are about 4,000kb then this player will roughly hold about 32 songs.Another thing that I was worryed about was the sound quality... it has its own settings in there but it also has eq settings that you can program... over all this is the best player out there I reviewed about 5 other players to this one and this one tops em all... 5 Stars...Pros--Great sound quality-good storage-user friendly software-small compactextra battery storage (if the Ni-Mh battery dies)Cons-battery compartment comes lose"
2,NOT Mac-supported,"I bought this player for two reasons - 1) it came with an FM radio which I want when I travel 2) it is supposedly Mac-compatible. After an hour of messing around with it, I called support (and got help on the second try). The guy said that they were not going to support it for iTunes 2, so if you've stayed current with the Mac software, you cannot use this player. I found an old version of iTunes, which did work with the player, but you still cannot use the 2x compression, which was another selling factor for me. Too bad, I liked the unit, but need one that will be supported!"
4,Great Little Unit,"After shopping around, trying to match storage capability with small size, I landed on the Yepp 700. So far it has been great. Sound is fantastic and with the 128mb expansion I am able to load hour and hours of high quality music.The software included is written by the folks at RioPortad frankly is lacking relative to MusicMatch, Real One or other jukebox programs. Kind of a pain to reload, sort and make playlists of music already on your PC. Definate opportunity.Regardless of the inconvenience, the size of the unit is great realitive to how much music you can load."
1,Not a best buy,"Yepp 700H is nice looking but apparently only works with iTunes 1.1 or 1.2 on the Mac platform. iTunes is on 3.0 with 2.0.4 being the last working version that ships with Apple products. It is useless to say Mac compatible.On a PC, the unit caused my computer to crash and repairs to software loads needed to be done to recover. So I was not able to get satisfaction via that route either.May be a good idea to just ...go- and get a iPod for Mac or PC.The buttons on the Yepp are difficult to use unless you have tiny fingers, the rocker switch slips and it's easy to depress the play function while rocking, confusing your input. The remote is cool though. The FM Tuner worked medium-well."
1,Player good- Software stinks,"I was happy with the player itself, but the software is terrible so I have to return the player. The software crashs my PC every time I try to scan my hard drive for new songs. It also does not read the MP3 files properly and therefore you have to rename all of the files if you care about what the titles are.Too bad- its a fine player but if I can't use the software I can use the player."
3,Software is [bad]!,"I love the Yepp MP3 player itself. It's cool looking and has some really cool features. However, the software it comes with leaves much to be desired. The most annoying problem is how it tries to organize file names. It doesn't let you sort by date modified and tries to split the file names into track title, artist, and album. That's great if your files are ripped from a CD, but if your files are downloaded, you're out of luck. Also, the system won't let you play tracks while you're in the selection window, and since the file names get all [messed] up, you can get really mixed up and frustrated. I've tried side stepping these problems by using the Windows Media Player Portable Device function and that won't work either... some unknown error. All in all, I think one might be better off waiting a while until Samsung upgrades the software or at least lowers the price. For my money there are just too many inconveniences to make this a truly great buy."
3,Not a very sturdy product,"The music playing capabilities of this little MP3 player are great. However, within a year of buying it, my Yepp is falling apart. I always carry the player in its carrying case and I've treated it very well (i.e. never dropped it, etc.) yet it looks like it's been in a war zone. The rechargeable battery compartment doesn't close anymore (it's currently being held closed by several rubber bands) and the non-rechargeable battery compartment is jammed by a battery that just doesn't want to come out. These problems arose within the 1st 6 months of owning the machine."
2,JH,"The basic device is pretty good, sound quality, simple controls, good display. But, the rest of the package is shoddy. The software is very confusing. The owners manual is simplistic and just plain wrong in a number of areas, particularly when describing the software. It comes with a nice looking leather pouch, that is unfortunately too small to hold the player without constantly squeezing the buttons. The pouch is also not designed to accomodate the earphone jack, so you have to walk around with the pouch flap hanging open all the time. I contacted Samsung technical support and their tech reps agreed with me regarding the software problems but couldn't help other than to suggest I try a different company's software! Bottom line, a real turn off from Samsung."
2,Mac users.. beware!,"I was all excited about my first mp3 player.. I spent tons of time researching and decided on the yepp...BUTThe Yepp DOES NOT work with OSX or iTunes 2.0...so even though I am on OS9, I had iTunes 2.0.. no go.. they said that they shipped from Korea without correcting it and that there are no plans as of right now to correct it.The customer service department was pretty helpful and offered to refund my money if the store I bought it from would not. but STILL.. a sticker warning people would be nice.. so now I am trying to Rio800.. we shall see."
4,Psychologically Enticing,"I first heard of this movie when flipping through my channels. I am a big an of anime and saw that this was japanese animation. I had never heard of it, and haven't since. I taped and what I found was a semi-classic that had been hidden for many years. Before Perfect Blue came out I'm sure this was one of the only anime of its kind. The story is about Remi Shimada (of the GoShogun team) who has a car accident and wakes up in a different world. From there she must face her greatest fears and overcome her weaknesses. If you can ever find this video rent it. For anime fans who enjoyed Perfect Blue!"
5,good,"I had to get a bag w/ enough support and room for many books...(nursing program). It's held up pretty well so far w/ no problems and I have to drag this thing thru street n rocks, conrete, & brick. Its only been a month but its held up great and I get alot of compliments in it being so different and cool lookin."
2,Biohunter,"Biohunter is pretty much stock anime. Its not boring, but it is predictable. The animation is okay in a 1980's kind of way. If you like cutting edge anime dont watch this, but if youre looking for a bit of rental fun and don't expect too much this would be just fine. Thanks for your time."
5,"A Good Compilation, but...","It's missing perhaps Edu Lobo's most famous song: Ponteio.Anyway, a good compilation without a doubt; it includes a very good treat; a duet with Brazlian singer Joyce on: ""Rei Morto, Rei Posto""; check it out.............."
2,NEVER use the movie mode on this camera!,"I have probably spent 50-60 hours trying to convert my digital movies recorded on this camera to dvd. I am not technically-savvy, so I expected to spend some time, but this is ridiculous. I finally got the imagemixer software (included on the Olympus Master disc)to burn a dvd, but the sound is just a high pitched squeak at the beginning of each clip. So irritating. I tried converting the quick time movies into mpeg-4 using cucusoft and burning a disc with nero express 6, but the quality was so poor, I didn't even bother to burn the dvd.As a still camera, this is fine. It's my first digital, and I have been happy with my photos. I like the larger than usual LCD. I also like the ability to close the LCD and drop the camera in my purse."
2,Bulky camera,"I got this camera for free with miles that were going to expire. Compared to what is out there, it is huge! I do like the folding viewer as it won't get scratched, but now a days you can buy the plastic covers for the viewers to avoid that.Needless to say, I'm still using it on vacations and will only buy a new one when this dies or breaks."
4,Great effort from Nanci,"This CD is a totally different effort for Nanci. Neither country nor folk, but a good variety of songs. One of her better efforts in recent years. Grows on you as her CD's usually do."
2,didactic and dull,"I have liked older Nanci Griffith a great deal. This is not those albums. I also have great affection for the protest singers of the 60s and 70s, but this is not that, either. Gee, war is bad, Nanc? Thanks for pointing that out. The lyrics on this one have all the profundity of a slightly slow 12 year old. As someone with degrees in English and Women's Studies, I was insulted by ""Back When Ted Loved Sylvia."" The track where Nanci tries scat-singing sounds like she is being poked with a sharp stick. Throughout, I was very surprised someone on the staff producing this did not point out that changing your vocal timbre and volume drastically in the space of three notes is jarring and unpleasant. Very very unimpressive."
4,Not one of her best,"Not one of Nanci's best, but the fan will want to have it in their collection. Caution...never attend one of her live concerts unless you like to hear her liberal drivel. Why entertainers think they are so intelligent about things other than music is beyond me."
1,Still Looking...,"I first heard ""Last of the True Believers"" maybe 5 years after it was first released. Since then I have been looking for something from Nanci as enjoyable as I found that album. And I am still looking."
4,"Nice arrangement, pleasant listening","I have to say from the beginning that this is probably the best symphonic adaptation of some rock music. The secret is, I would say, in the development of the original music. Glass takes the themes of the instumental pieces form Bowie's 'Low' album and develops themes in three full symphonic pieces, not in the usual way, by simply arranging them for orchestra but also by adding more themes and musical ideas, basically rewriting them. The music is a little bit unusual for Glass, more developed, also the listening is not very demanding. The second piece seems to a better rhythm and I think is the best of the three. However, all three of them stand together and create a unified, nice piece of work."
4,Schubert redux,"Glass once said that Schubert is his favorite composer.Franz's idiosyncratic grace is evident in this work.At first hearing, I felt it to be so personal that I hesitated recommending it to others."
3,Rare story,"This film provides a rare opportunity for you to get a peek into the life of suthor, James Baldwin. If you are not an ardent reader, you will know little of this wonderful writer. I only wish that there will be a biography on film of this man. Until that comes along, this is the only film that I have seen that gives you an inside of his life."
5,Good stuff...,"Just based on his great interveiw on CNBC on April 16 2010, when he explained whyGoldman Sachs may have committed fraud...I had to buy Sylvain's book.Search for ""Sylvain Raynes"" on youtube where Sylvain accussed Jim Cramer (Mad Money) of being a Goldman Sachs Public Relations Officer on April 16 2010."
4,Great,"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate. I will admit, the beginning was rather grueling, but looking back, I am glad I finished the book. Dickens has a fabulous vocabulary and an excellent sense of people. The characters are dynamic and quite various. I would recommend this book to other scholars."
4,I wanted to love this book,"and I very nearly did.For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."
4,Get entertained with Great Expectations,"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my high school years. Get entertained with Mr. Joe and her violence towards Pip and her husband Mr. Joe Gargery.Also, Pip travels to France to become a gentlemen, which is one of the best parts of this novel."
4,The Height of My Expectations,"Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book. Throughout the whole book Dickens kept my attention and had me wanting more. From the very first page when Pip encounters the convict, I could not put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen. Also when Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe, was attacked I was guessing to the very end to find out whom it was who attacked her. This is by far one of the best books I have read. All in all, I recommend you read this book. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I have."
4,Great Expectations Review,"The reason that I chose this book was because I saw the play at my high school.I thought that this play was performed really good by the student body,so i decided to read the book, and the book was pretty good. I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together."
4,This was a book with many surprising outcomes.,"This book was not as interesting as some other books that I have read. Some of the chapters were confusing and is in need of some clarification. But then again, there are many unseen connections that are made. But overall, it was interesting and much like a soap opera with some dull moments."
5,Great Book - if you read it all.,"This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."
5,loved it!,"Great Expectations is one of the best books I have ever read. Dickens provides the reader with a great story and a wonderful mistery. His presentation of the identity stuggle within Pip is, at the lack of a better word, marvelous.Everytime I thought I had the story figured out, I was presented with a jaw droping event that got me even more interested.I would recommend this book to anyone! It's worth taking on your next trip to the beach. Cheers!"
3,Leaning toward four stars...,"After several futile attempts, I was literally forced to read this novel for school. I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts. I found the whole idea of a women stopping her clocks and living in darkness due to unrequited love a little morbid, yet also slightly romantic, and I found myself disliking the main character with a vengence. Not his best, certainly, but still okay."
3,Great Expectations is a poor intro to Dickens,"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."
4,Puffin Classics: Charles Dickens,I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too.
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother"""
2,Alright- Not that good,"Understood classic by others, but it bored me. Then again, I had to read this for school. I found it to lack in a real plot. I am a fan of Charles Dickens but this one was not good."
4,"fantastic twists , fateful turns, humorous, and good morals and much more!","Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile. The title is fantastic, Great Expectations! How great, and how ominous! Indeed!"
5,One of the all time great classics.,"Dickens is a master of personalities. He never wastes a character he introduces. They are all tied in to the plot. In Pip he brings out all the good and evil in people. Though I was hoping for a happier ending, its anticlimatic that both Pip and Estella find themselves together years later though neither one fulfilled their life ""Expectations."" This is my second time reading this great book and I would read it a thousand times and still love it."
3,Dickensian values,Fascinating tale of a young man's encounters with upwardly mobile life and the moral values involved. Still highly pertinent in the 21st century.
4,what i read i liked,"I had to read this book in fifth grade English class, I didn't read it and now I want to, I haven't finished it yet but I like it. So far I'm at the part were Pip is playing cards with that snobby girl, I can't remember her name."
5,I had low expectations,"Reading Dickens is a magical experience. Once you start reading, you are completely drawn into the world he is creating. Marvelous story teller, incredible writer, fascinating characters. Great Expectations is a great book, by a master of the craft."
4,Enjoyed it more now than in high school,Get characters. All kinds of emotional confrontations. Some things would be politically incorrect now. Loved it. Nice break from some of the thrown together single topic stories I've read recently.
5,A Rollicking Good Classic,"Can't believe I had never read this, not even seen a movie based onthis book! How shocking. I had no good excuse not to get it, as it was freefor Kindle at the time. Oprah also has this on her book list.I really found it very interesting and was caught up in the storyline very quickly. I love historical romances anyway. This is not really a romance, though there isa complicated love in the main character's life. This book reminds me of the broodingclassics like Heathcliff. That seemed to be the thing back then.It will not hurt anyone to read it, and you might even enjoy it!"
4,A classic!,It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have. Thats why I decided to have this one. It is Dickens at its best. :)
2,A short story told in 400 pages.,"This book could have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length novel it lacks both and entertaining plot and characters that one can truly empathize with."
2,Fair...but....,This book has a good story concept and Dickens writes well...but the story would have been alot better had he not been paid by the word. His lengthy descriptions of mundane tasks serve to break the pacing of a novel that already barely dredges along.
2,Eh...,"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class. While it had some parts that were somewhat interesting, overall I couldn't get into the book. I couldn't even finish the book, I was so bored with it. I don't recommend it."
2,This book is not worth your time,"I am an avid reader and enjoy reading most books. This book, however, I found exstremely boring and I constantly lost interest. There were very few interesting chapters and I was thrilled at finally finishing the book and moving on to another that was better. I can honestly say that this book was one of the worst books I have ever read and would never recommend it to anyone."
2,Lower Your Expectations,"I did not have ""great"" expectations after reading some of Mr. Dickens other work (see my review of ""Tale of The Two Cities""). But someone told me they at least made a movie about this one so I figured I may as well give it a shot.Well lets just say that I wont be seeing the movie but I will admit that this one is at least better then the other book because it is just thick enough to balance out this wobbly dresser I have when I weged it under one of the legs.A better effort! I give you a generous TWO STARS this time Charlie! Youre getting there so keep trying!"
1,Too many words,"This is my least favorite book. I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day. I don't know if all Dickens is this bad, but I'll not read any more of his books until I'm forced to for my next English class."
2,Read This it will Help!,"This book is not a book most people should read. I wouldn't call it horrible but it is intensly boring. Dickens takes a whole chapter to say something anybody could say in a sentence. Im in the eighth grade and am required to read it. At times i dont have a clue wats goin on but i get the basic gist of the story and plot. I only recommend this for reader lovers, highly advanced people in litereture and who can understand something not written in english."
1,Yuck!,"Do not read this book. It is a form of painful torture! If you have to read it for school buy the Cliff Note. Or if your instructor is on to that kind of thing, at least listen to the audio book. At all costs do not read this book! Take it from someone who knows."
1,Don't Have Great Expectations For This Novel.,"You won't be needing a bookmark with this novel- more like a pillow! I read this my freshman year of high school, maybe I was just too young to understand it and appreciate it, but I could not read the whole thing without falling asleep. After reading half the book, I read the cliff notes and actually found them more interesting than the novel itself. Unless you are suffering from insomnia, I wouldn't buy it."
1,The Ultimate Failure,"I had to read GE for my freshmen honors English class, and I thought Lord of the Flies was bad! Dickens takes 1 paragraph to convey an idea that could have been said in 1 sentence! Many of the vocabulary is just out of our time, and take the fun out of the story. Unless you have heaps of time and patience, I recommend that you stay away from this ""book""."
3,The book is very slow.,"Great Expectations By: Charles DickensGreat Expectations is about a boy named Pip who comes into great property and is searching for the benefactor of his fortunes. I didn't care for the ending much because I was thinking something great should happen, but then there's a big let-down. It was hard for me to keep my attention on the book. Everything is explained with such great detail, and half of the things explained don't need to be. If you enjoy reading books that are very detailed, this is the book for you!"
4,"Quaint, but a good story","This is truly a masterpiece. It is an inspiring tale of a departure from innocence into the cruel realities of the real world. Although not totally enlightening, it is entertaining and leaves one on the edge from chapter to chapter."
3,"good plot, but very hard to follow.","OK... I know how Dickens is supposed to be this wonderful author, but lets just face it - Its boring! Its not his fault, when he wrote everyone wrote like that, but these days its just too hard to follow.. The plot was really good tho.. almost like an old soap opera, with twists and turns everywhere.. Now if he could have written the same story in 200-300 pages instead of 500, maybe people would enjoy this book more!"
3,It's a notable work,"This is worth the time to read. It's actually a bit amusing to see if you can follow the bread-crumb trail and predict what'll happen next. (Usually, you'll be right.) I offer this warning: * Do NOT read the abridged version! * In tightening things up, they usually cut out the best parts."
5,"In repsonse to ""A reader from St. Louis, MO""","You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a ""loser"" - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."
2,The Strongest Sedative Available Without a Prescription,"I had to read this book twice: once in the ninth grade and once in college. While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."
2,didn't live up to my expectations,"I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book."
5,This is a classic pageturner!,"I've been out of college for awhile. Being away from literature and into the ""Real World,"" I had almost forgotten what reading a good book is like. I picked this up and literally couldn't do anything else until I finished reading it! Highly recommended for anyone who loves good fiction."
5,Nice,My daughter needed this book for school and the weather was too bad to go out and look for it. We found it on Amazon and had it shipped to us. It was delivered sooner than expected.
5,Sweet story,"I had a chance to see the film several times. I really loved it. It is a bitter-sweet love-story of a boy with deep feelings. It is not an easy-to-read book, not everyone will like it. It is much better, than the film I also like."
5,Beautiful Book,I've always wanted my own set of classic books. These couldn't be more beautifully bound. They really are beautiful. I absolutely urge you to buy this book if you're on the fence about it. It'll at least at some visual interest to your library if you don't plan on reading it!
4,A good classic.,"I read this because my son had to read it for his 9th grade english class. For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always ""get it"" until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip ""saw no shadow of another parting from her,"" could mean that they were never seperated again. Duh! Like I said, old language and another time!!"
4,Great Expectations were met!! (pun intended),Beautifully binded book. Exactly what I was looking for. Makes my collection of books look really nice. And Dickens is the best!
5,Great expectations,I love the way this book was printed.I want to buy all my books from Vintage Classics.The words in the book aren't super small so its easy to read but theres still room to write on the margins and at the bottom of pages.The story line is kinda slow but it gets good.This book is one of the five most often referred to on the AP literature exam.Good Luck too other APers
2,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!,"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"
2,A BIG BOOK ABOUT NOTIHNG!,"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on. If the book wasn't as long, it might have been better. I heard somewhere that Dickens got paid by the word and that is was there's a lot of extra, stupid words in it. I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."
3,Where is the ending?,"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."
4,Great Expectations Is Great,"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."
2,Great expectations not accomplished,I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century.
3,Great Expectations,The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing.
1,"Great Expectations, a great disapointment","Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read ""A Christmas Carol"" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."
1,"What a long, boring book",I had to do this for school. I could hardly get through it. All they did was talk. It was long and boring. I HATED IT!
1,AHHH VERY boring,This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating. This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book?
1,HORRID!!!!!,"This book was literally the worst thing thats happened in my whole entire life.I was forced to read this long. boring book for english class and either fell asleep, or sat there and sared off into spce.THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!The only GOOD thing about this book is that I hav found a new way to doze off without sum sleeping pills (just read the first two pages and WALLA ure fast asleep!!!!!!!)"
1,Thank God for Sparknotes,"Let me see.I hate this book. It is a required reading for English, mostly to show the difference between Flat and Round characters. Well it worked! Most of the characters in this book are flat! Ugh.I can't get over how the plotine doesn't even move normally. Its like when you want to drive somewhere and you hit a million and one detours. Eventually you'd say, ""Screw it! Who needs food?"" But nooo... Dickens just kept on driving around. I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it. I was just going to make sure I knew enough to pass the test I had to take on the garbage.Ironically enough, those of us who used Sparknotes got better test grades than those who actually read the book. That say something about how much sense it made..."
1,BO-RING!,"This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond ""I'm rich and you're not,"" and ""Oh, how I do love the lady Estella."" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."
1,This book is boring and hard to understand!,"Hi! my name is Roy Chan and I am reading this when I'm in 7th grade. I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."
1,If you can't sleep read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have. I figured that it was going to be a wonderful book because of the author (wrong) Ihad to strugle just to read 2 pages without getting sleepy. Altough I have great respect for Dickens and all of his accomplishments, I did NOT like this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not one of Dickens best,Last year as a Freshman in high school I was assiagned to read this book as a class project like many of the other critics who have already written their crities. Although I must admit that the book was in reality flat out boring and totaly lacking in point I would not recomend giving up on Dickens becuse of it. I can not with in any honesty recomend this book to anybody but I would eagerly recoment Dickens.
1,"Long-Winded, Excruciating to Read and Finish","I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books. This was the first book I ever read that truly took the joy out of reading for me."
4,The Best Little Poorhouse In London,"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of ""you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !""). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls ""Trevor"". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again. I predict that this book will have resurgence in popularity and soon everybody will be saying, "" Is that your Dickens in your hand?"""
4,Solid,"An undeniably solid book. I can certainly identify with Pip, but it was, at times, drab. Maybe if I hadn't been forced to read it I would have enjoyed it more."
5,Timeless Masterpiece on the Trials of Growing Up,"Dickens is a rare genius who succeeded in capturing vividly the manifold pains - physical, emotional, and moral - of childhood and the effect of these scars in the adulthood. As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."
3,A sophicatedly plotted and beautifully written novel,"Great Expectations has been one of the first of many novels I happen to touch upon fashioned by Charles Dickens. I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."
3,From A Different Era,"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime. If the schools are trying to expose antsy kids to Dickens, they may be better served with A Tale of Two Cities, which moves a bit faster in my opinion."
2,Not as great as I was expecting,"I was assigned to read for my honours English class and I have never read a more stupendesely boring book.It's a revered book but it lacks everything that makes a book truly great.It's poorly written,uninteresting,the characters are unlikable,there is very little theme or characterization,the plot is virtually non-existent.The chapters are so meandering and pointless you have to force yourself to read it.English students shouldn't have to suffer by being made read this incomprehensible,boring, overrated 'novel'.I'd rather watch paint dry than read this book again.Still,any insomniacs looking for a cure,this book's for you."
1,Get the free version and save your money for a cup of coffee,"It's not worth it, even with the low price of 1.99. You're better off getting the free version. The only thing you're going to get is a couple of illustrations and there is no link for a free audio book like it says there is."
5,Amazing Read,I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella. Amazing depiction of characters that stick with you and linger even after finishing.
3,Disappointed,"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's. This illogical story has some exciting and entertaining parts to it,as well as old fashioned humor, but as a whole it is slow and tedious. Read it if you have patience, otherwise, you are in for a long one."
5,Met my expectations,This classic was all I thought it would be & more. Descriptions wonderful. Characters stay with you. Dickens moves a story along in his own unique way.GKE
1,Travesty,It is an insult to any reader who wants to enjoy Dickens's books. It has been severely abridged (with a very inconspicuous mention of the fact) for no obvious reason. It also has an asinine foreword by some dubious character. Do not touch it if you like literature!
3,Great classic story!,"The classic story we've known, loved, and shared with our children.However the page size of this edition is so small, it makes the book difficult to read and overly thick.Given the choice, I'd pick a version with a more conventional size."
4,Great Expectations,"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like ""skilful"", for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman. Now I just have to see how it ends!I'd recommend it to people who are older than highschool, just because I think you'd enjoy and understand it a lot more! But if you're a real bookworm, you'd like it. :)"
3,"Great novel, not so great edition","Though this is a decent, affordable edition of Dickens' late masterpiece, any mildly curious reader should buy the Oxford Classics edition instead. The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."
5,Funny book!,I'm loving this old book. I never realized how comical a style it was written in. I bet if you read it in high school and retread it at an older age you would practically think it was a different book!
1,great expectations by charles dickens i would like the book if i could just get it,"i ordered it december 19, 2010 and it said i would get it between december 27th - january 11th..........everytime i have ever ordered anything on amazon i have always gotten prompt service...............it is now january 10th and nothing yet"
1,I liken it to the title,"I looked forward to reading a classic of Dicken's. Like the title, Great Expectations were had, but not realized. None of the characters were likable, there was no character growth, and it rambled. I have taken great joy in reading Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and even Tolkien. At least Tolkien went on and on, it was with purpose and there was a point. Dickens' point was to say that life sucks and there is no point. In which case, what is the point of reading this book?"
1,good for adults,had to read this for school and found it very boring. unless you like things being dragged out then do not read this. good plot but overly explanitive.
1,Amazon should allow a zero star rating for this book!,By far the worst literary blunder the world has ever excreted. I would never wish this horific mass of boredom upon anyone. Avoid this book like the black plauge (another one of Europe's tragedies).
2,Not as great as I expected,"This is often listed as a reading requirement for college and high school classes alike, I read it in college. But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good. But even the best of author's can have a mess-up every now and then and ""Great Expectations"" is certainly not one that I would recommend reading."
2,not a Dickens fan,"I know, I know...I'm just a stupid high school student who's brain has been fried by television. I was forced to read this novel in 11th grade and I couldn't finish it. Must be because I play too many video games, right?I'm a freshman in college now, and I still hate Dickens. Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; ""A Connecticut Yankee"" was a page-turner for me, and ""Huck Finn"" is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."
2,Not so great,"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool. I had to read it in my upper division English Lit class in college and I just couldn't get into it. There are way too many retarded characters on which Dickens spends too much time, Pip gets more annoying with every page, especially his love for Estella who is one of the most disgusting characters in the book. I've read Jane Eyre before this and it was a real page turner. This is plain boring."
2,Too Many COINCIDENCES!!,"Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper"
3,okay,"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him? A convict wants to give all his money to Pip because he scared him so much he got him to do what he wanted? I could go on some more, but I'm bored, 3 stars for the writing."
1,CHARLES DICKENS IS EXTREMELY OVERATED!,"I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books!"
1,Dated,"For some reason I missed Dickens when I was a child, so I decided to catch up on one of the great works of the English canon. I'm sorry -- I know that by critical accord he's one of the finest and most influential of all English writers. And I understand the important work that he did in publicising social justice causes such as child labour. But I find his prose ornate and contrived, his plot slow-moving and predictable, and his characters implausibly one-dimensional. In my opinion Dickens does not pass the test of time."
1,"Overrated, worthless, and so very boring","This book reminds me of algebra, its boring, time-consuming, worthless, and you will never have to use this in your whole life. Never! So when you're teacher asks you to read this book, don't do it. Read the Cliff Notes or watch the Wishbone version."
5,If you don't like it then shut the hell up!,"Every high school kid who has written a review complaining about this book being boring should be boiled with their own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through their heart!Well, thats from A Christmas Carol but you get my point.This book is just great, you can't get any better than it except for maybe David Copperfield. Its one of Dickens best, I could read it over and over and over and over....you get the point. Anyway, Amazon shouldn't allow all these stupid kids to gripe about the books anyway, they can never say anything more intelligent than ""It was boring."" Well, poor things. I would just like to tell them that nobody gives a f_c_ and to grow up."
4,Eric's Book Review for Mr. Lynch's class,"I believe that this book is very well written. It is so far one of the best love story books that I have read in my life. I believe that it is one of charles dickens' best books that he has written. The only thing that i don't like about the book is the ending. the publishers should have kept charles dickens' original ending. If the publishers had not changed the original ending, to me, this book would have been a fife star book."
3,"Too long, too boring","Too long, you could skip pages in this book and still be reading the same thing. I suggest finding a good summary. The movie was relaly good. Way better."
2,Is it over yet?,"Like many other reviewers, I have been dragged into reading this book by a literature class. The story line is mildly interesting, but most of the book contains fluff that is pointless and you just have to suffer through. The language is also very difficult to understand and not a ""skimmable"" book, by any means. If you really insist on reading this book, I would suggest getting the SparkNotes or the Cliff Notes. They tell you all you need to know: There's an orphan. His name is Pip. By a chain of events, Pip recieves a great deal of money. He moves to London and becomes extremely arrogent. And it goes on. Not the most enjoyable endeavor."
3,"Well written, engaging, detailed, - it's Dickens.","How does one review Dickens? This book is well written, of course. The plot is engaging, of course. The descriptions are detailed, of course. The fact he wrote this in sections to be published in the newspaper just amazes me. However, I found the coincidences in this story too contrived to be really believable. It is a fascinating look into 19th century Britain."
5,Great Expectations,This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter. I was very pleased with the item and the shipping. She was delighted to receive the book. I will shop first at Amazon for everything I am wanting to purchase.
2,A extremely boring book.,"This book is so boring, I have to read it for my Honors Preparation English Liturature and Writing Class. It is really difficult to understand also."
1,Great Expectations Deflated,"I was greatly disappointed with the way this classic story was printed. The typing errors throughout the book ie.words that all ran into each other, and even pages of the story missing, made what should have been a pleasant read into a chore to finish it.I had looked forward to re-reading all the old school classics on my new Kindle but if the conversion of the old publications to e-readers are of the same standard, then I will not want to do so.I fear that ""Oliver will not be asking for more"" unless the recipe is improved.I have rated it only one star ,not because of Dickens Story but because it was spoiled for me by it's typing."
2,Let down,I am no english literature purist by any stretch of the imagination but I did have high hopes for this book.The characters are realistic to the period but the story is very slow. The first half of the book is little better than boring. It picks up through the second half but finishes rather disappointingly.This book was purchased after a book club suggested it was Dickens' greatest work. Having read David Copperfield a number of years ago I would have to disagree.I am glad I read the book even if the only thing I got out of it was to be able to relate to it when others are discussing it.
2,Great production but no index,A great reading but the sixteen discs are not labeled as to chapters on the disc nor are there any liner notes. You must play the disc and wait for the chapter to be mentioned during the reading. I do not see why they would have left these necessary conveniences out. Very inconvenient.
4,Beautiful Covers Make For A Eye-Catching Novel,"I have to admit I have not read this yet. I saw these advertised in a magazine and just HAD to have them. I used a gift card and bought 4 or 5. They are just eye-candy on one of my tables right now....but I do want to read them. They weren't packed very well. They were just put in an oversized box, I'm lucky they didn't get messed up."
5,Great Expectations,"I had read this book in hs, but totally had forgotten it. What a great reread! The book is so well written with the dialect of the time. The plot unwinds and twists so many times. It is very touching. Loved it!!"
5,Great Expectations,"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too. This book was a free download too at the time, I downloaded the softare as well as 99 other books!"
5,Great,My daughter had to read this book for school and she said it was a great read. She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow.
2,A High School Senior's Review...,"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."
4,Great Expectations,"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."
2,Hard to Read,"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."
5,Lived Up To My Expectations!,"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a superb book! I must admit that it is a tad wordy and the details are overwhelming, but that just adds character to the book. My favorite characters were Estella, Biddy, and of course, Pip. Many poeple my age (I am 15) have said that this book was a long and boring ramble. I thought it to be exciting and very funny. I especially enjoy the part where Joe visits Pip in London and he has no place to put his hat, so he puts it on the mantle. During their meal, Joe's hat keeps falling, and Joe keeps picking it up. Finally, Pip gets so annoyed, he throws the hat across the room! Great Expectations is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone!"
4,A Timeless Classic!,"I never had to read Dickens in high school or in college; so I decided to try this classic author. This book was extremely FUNNY! Pip and Joe were particularly hilarious throughout the first half of the story...Also, I understood the British writing more easily than I thought I would! (Though for many of the dated words I had to use the Kindle dictionary.) I loved the characters! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the story did go on a bit long near the end.But Dickens is a great storyteller! Nicholas Nickleby is next for me..."
5,Read in context...,"Definitely not a modern read, but that can be a good thing. The style of of writing in Mr. Dickens's era may seem a little over the top by current literature, but the character's grab you, you want to know how they do, what they do. Inlove good storytelling."
2,Great Expectations... Great Disappointment,I'd heard Chuck was one of them super writers but they talked all kinds of funny in this here book. I didn't understand a plum thing he was a tryin' to say. I reckon this book is for them smarty pants types.
4,Wonderful Version...horribly organized,"This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter. Some chapters start in the middle of disks or even in the middle of tracks. My 7th graders love to listen to it, so it has been worth the aggravation of trying to find which chapter is where."
5,Funnier than I remember,"I read Great Expectations back in high school, but had forgotten most of it. It was the selection for our book club, so I bought it to read again.Although it's very long, it's a wonderful book, rich with detail and timeless for it's social issues and examination of interpersonal relationships.I had forgotten (or perhaps didn't appreciate in high school) how funny Dickens is. His sense of humor, and ability to convey emotion and atmosphere are extraordinary.I got it too late to finish for the book club and had to consult Spark notes (which are great for summary), but I hope to finish it soon. Fabulous read."
4,Good read,I am definately a fan of Great Expectations (although don't go see the movie made about it with Gweneth Paltrow). I've had to read this book about three times in high school but I enjoyed it every time. My recommendation will probably mean little because if your still in school you will probably have to read it anyways...but I still recommend it.
4,Much Ado About Nothing,"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."
1,audiobook link is broken,"The kindle text is fine, but please be alerted that the link provided to get the free audiobook takes you to some japanese website that has nothing to do with Great Expectations that I could find."
1,Abridged copy,"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."
4,Doesn't Contain the Original Ending,"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending. It was placed at the end, after the ending that was originally published. I much preferred the original ending from the momentI read it, and have since checked every copy I have come across to see if it is in them. Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."
2,Expectations fell short,"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom. We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."
3,Dickens's verbose novel,"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose. The novel has a good plot, but the writting is sometimes hard to follow. It took me one whole month to read the book and fully understand it. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the classics, because it has a great story. Readers beware though, they must be ready to analyze everything in order to understand the novel"
4,YOUR LIKING IT DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTE!,"This version of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations"" may make a fine read: but that really depends on your taste. Yes, Charlotte Mitchell tailored it well. The overall layout is good; although some chapters may dampen your interest if you are a reluctant fan of 19th Century English."
2,Had to read or would not have,"My daughter had to read this for an extra credit assignment. It was brutal for me as much as it was for her, listening to her complain about how boring it was. If you like this type of classic writing you might enjoy it but for a 15 year old it didnt seem like the right book to get them interested in reading."
3,It's Okay,"I remember really liking this book the first time I read it. The second go around, not so much. Oliver Twist is a much better Dickens novel."
4,Beyond my expectations!,Our book group decided to read a book by Charles Dickens in this the bicentenary of his birth. I had read some books by Dickens when at school and found them rather dry so chose Great Expectations because it was one I hadn't previously read. To my surprise I really enjoyed it especially the language used and the unusual characters.
4,Still a great read,"It is a good book for all ages.I am a senior citizen, and enjoyed the story, and style of writing as much as when I was in school."
4,Great Expectato s,"I had not read this book since I was at school many years ago. Enjoyed it just as much as then - some of Dickens books are very hard to get through but this one, along with several others such as a Tale of Two Cities, are easy to read and not outdated as a lot of older books are. I would recommend to any one wanting to read some of the old classics."
4,Wanting more!,It left me wanting more. This was a very beautifully written love story. I found the attraction between Estella and Finn was more true and captivating then Romeo &Juliet.
2,"The book was so boring, but the movie was alright.","Well, I am reading this book in my english class at school, and it puts everybody to sleep! First of all, if Estella hit me like she did pip, I would have hit her back!! All the women in this book seem like stuck up b****es! Even the movie wasn't the best. I figured it would have made more sense than the book did, but I was wrong! You can barely understand what they say! Well, I just don't like the book, or the movie. I think they were both stupid, and neither of them make sense!!"
3,Confused about its Greatness!,"After reading A Tale of Two Cities a month previous, I took up the trial of reading this book. I compared the two and expected an earth-shattering discovery that made everything click somewhere between page 200-300... Unfortunately as you could tell, it never came. I read every page searching for why people loved this book! After reading the last page, I put the book down and felt disappointment that I still hadn't alighted on it. I realized Pip's selfishness once the wealth settled on him, and realized his turn-a-bout after losing everything to his name. But the book didn't fully finish in my thoughts, it just hung there without a sole purpose. I challenge anyone to read it and find for themselves why any book is considered a classic!"
2,"Alright, but could be better","I had to read this for honors freshman English, and now my AP English class is considering reading it again for whatever unGodly reason. In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being ""wordy,"" and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories. No wonder so-called classics like ""Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Great Expectations"" is heaped in a drudgery of fluff."
2,It was better than i remeber...,"I was forced to read this in school and despised it with a passion. I read it again recently, for some reason, and was surprised at how much I liked it. I guess the reason I didn't like the first time was because I was forced to read it; it's that 'Peace forced is tyranny' mentality."
4,GREAT EXPECTATIONS!!,"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."
3,An undisputed classic,"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well. If you can get past the boring language you will definitely enjoy it. If you went in with 'great expectations',then i doubt that you will come out with great pleasure. if you are put off by this review, hten check out the 1930's version starring the late Alec Guiness- it's absolutely brilliant!"
2,BORING!,"i am sorry but this book was boring, in my opinion of course. i was forced to read it in english. this is one of those books that i had to physically sit myself down and force myself to read it. i didn't like a majority of this book and i'm glad we are done reading it."
1,UGH,"I was required to read this book for english class and I must say it is by far the worst book I have ever read. I know that it is supposed to be a ""classic"" but I just found it dull and uninteresting and just couldn't get into it. I would not recommend it."
2,This book was a very big disappontment,"This book was a very big disappontmet. I thought this book could have had a couple minor plot changes. I also thought the way the main charictor, Pip, transfored through his expectations was shallow and padanthic. To conclude, I belive that the chapters are cycled like story line with many charictors and an entire chapter with Pip talking to himself and talking about his expectations. Thank you for reading my review."
1,this book sucks,"I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long. There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep. avoid at all costs"
1,Great Expectations is possibly the worst book ever,You guys should never read this book everCharles Dickens just goes on and on trying to make a point that you can do in a sentence. He takes the whole chapter. I don't recomend this for anyone. Only read it if forced to. It is not a good book.
2,I Expected Better,"I simply expected this book to be greater than it was. It just wasn't great, and that's what I expected. It did not greatly exceed my expectations, but I should have expected that, since others told me to expect a not-so-great book."
1,Great Expectations - Major Disapointment!,"I enjoy Dickens, so when I decided to read Great Expectations, I had just that... Great expectations. Unfortunately, this novel is the most boring tripe I've ever read. The 'hero' is nothing but a whiner with a 'poor me' complex.Don't waste your time, read one of Dickens' other books."
1,Do not read this book!,"To start this book is so dry it could catch on fire. Also description in the book, ha there is none to be spoken of. This book has been called Charles Dickens greatest novel, not even close, save your time, and money for buying a better book."
2,"Boring beginnig, Good ending","I had to read this book for my English class and at first it was so boring! It about a young boy named Pip and he is trying to find his true indentity. At the end of the first phase he goes to London to become a ""gentleman"" because that is what his benefactor wants (Pip doesn't know his benefactor). At the end of the 2nd phase, he finds out who his benefactor is. Those two phases in the book are really boring, but I think it gets better in the end. If you read this book I suggest that you just start in the third phase because the rest is boring."
1,ZZZZZZZ SNOOZE ZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!,"I along with the rest of my freshman honors english class was forced to read this book. It was BY FAR the worst book I've ever had to read. I along with half of my class could read no more than one page of it without falling into a deep slumber. I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it. Anyway, if someone does want to buy this book for some strange reason, I hope that they do not have Great Expectations for it, because they will be very disappointed at the end when their expectations aren't fulfilled!"
1,Great Expesctations- the worst book of all time,"Charles Dickens.......when the name comes to mind at first we think of a great author, but this absolutely pointless book disgraces his name. It brings me down to the point of feeling sory for the trees to which this book had to be printed. This book is entirely over-rated and just due to dicken's reputation for great work, we're supposed to just read the trash and nod our heads? Absolutely not. This book might be interesting to someone chained to a palm tree on a deserted island but to the remaining other i would tell them to not waste their time by reading this book."
1,The worst book I have ever read!!!,"The book was so stupid Pip should have just got a life and grow up. Like he really cared about Miss Havisham he only liked her for her money, and Estella. Besides if you ask me it was the dumbest book I have ever read I should't have ever wasted my time like that."
1,Overrated Book,Charles Dickens and this book are very overrated. Charles Dickens does not make anysense in this book. Very confusing. The talks about the same subject forever. I skipped a whole chapter and he was still talking about the same thing. I give this book a minus 200 on a scale from 1-5.
3,Boring,"OK. I like reading and everything but when I read at the begining of this school year, I was bored out of my mind through the whole book. I found absolutly no point to this book"
1,Profoundly worthless.,"Just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel. This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse."
2,Great Expectations a Great Dissapointment,"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read ""A Christmas Carol"" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."
3,It would have been easy to add a little more,"For being a pretty good scope, by all accounts, I was disappointed that the scope lacks some of the most basic features, such as a sighting aid built into the body of the scope to help you properly aim the scope at your subject. A small ring on the side of the eyepiece cap and lens cap would be handy so that you could hang the caps off the scope while it is in use, rather than having to stash them somewhere and possibly misplace them. Easy items to add, disappointingly absent."
3,Not enough to the reputation of Deitel's,"I like the way Deitel teaches. I always got much help from C, C++ and java from Deitels's How to Program series. But this one is not satifactoty. Even though this book's title is xml, contents about xml technoligies are not dealt with sufficiently. Some chapters contain the introduction to asp,cgi,perl and java. The introduction to those technologies are easy to get on internet and in other books. The authors should deal with core xml technologies.The Deitel's series are of college-text- book-sytle.I guess xml is not for college course style. If you are new to xml from non programming experience or the other programming lanuguage. I recommend the XML in a nutshell by Rusy Harold."
1,A Big Waste,"This book is a big waste of money. Besides being very expensive, most of the book covers other subjects other than XML, with little relevance to XML. Although there is some useful information on using XML with Java, there is way too much information on the Microsoft implementation of XML, (when the book actually gets around to mentioning XML) and the standardized W3 version of XML seems to be included as an afterthought. The reviewers who gave this book such a high rating probably didn't read the book very well, or are hired by the publisher. A much better book is the Liz Castro Quickstart guide to XML (for a fourth of the price of the Deitel!), although it is centered around the W3's standard for XML, and doesn't mention Microsoft's implementation. Castro text, however, is more suited to learning from the ground up. The Deitel text is a disaster and I wish that I had just kept my money."
5,"GET THIS BOOK! Wonderful format, etc","This book was written in easily understood jargon that helped take the mystery out of XML programming for me. Additionally, the links to actual working code allowed me the opportunity to watch it work. The self review and tests at the end of each chapter really ensures that you get everything out of the chapter that you need to continue on. Loved it. You will, too."
3,Final Morse episode: less than expected,"Perhaps I've been spoiled by watching 'Inspector Lewis' in the years since John Thaw died. Seeing Lewis's management style with Hathaway has made me more sharply aware of just how abusive Morse was toward Lewis. Or perhaps I've just gotten older, and less tolerant of bullies, and more willing to say so.Nonetheless, I'd looked forward with great anticipation to the final episode of ""Inspector Morse,"" figuring that we might actually be treated to the sight of a moving transition from old curmudgeon to young apprentice. This did not happen. Granted, the actor was ill and dying, but I frankly expected more from the writers. We were left with a disconnect that was not addressed in the opening episode of ""Inspector Lewis,"" or ""Lewis"" as it's sometimes called."
3,"Good, But Only One Episode","I mistakenly thought there were multiple episodes on this DVD. With only one, it seems rather expensive."
5,Disappointed that I did not get the correct DVD,"I already own all 33 DVDs in the series of INSPECTOR MORSE. I feel this series is the most intellegently written and superbly acted programing on television. John Thaw was the best there was.I ordered this DVD since it was supposed to come with an added bonus of ""The Last Morse"". When the DVD arrived this was not on it so I called to see if I could have it replaced with one that did. I was told AMAZON could not promise it would arrive with the added footage so I simply returned it.I was very disappointed.I still gave it a 5 star for the DVD ""THE REMORSEFUL DAY"""
4,Great Game,NIntendogs is a really fun game to play. I got it for Christmas and I loved it from the beginning. It is so much fun to interact with the dogs and play with them. Overall this is a great game for animal lovers and just for people who like to play video games too!
3,Voice Recognition is a Problem,"Nintendogs was my first ever game for DS. For the first couple months, I played it nonstop. It was extremely cool, because you could draw walk routes, and train for competitions. You could even teach commands! But that's where the trouble started. You see, the dogs recognize commands by voice, so if your voice changes, then you have to teach them everything all over again, which takes forever. So I would just recommend this game for adults, or kids already through puberty."
2,Its fun but...,"Its pretty fun. I love dogs and I got this game because I didn't have a real one. But then the day came, I GOT A REAL PUPPY. After that I didn't play it hardly at all because #1 It got boring (All games do)#2 Why would I play it?! I have a real dog!If you have a real dog don't bother taking care of and loving a fake one. Spend time with you REAL dog.But if you don't have a dog this is a good game because it is pretty realistic."
5,awsome!!!,"i bought this game for under 20 dollers , it was a great game the only thing is i am not very good at the contests"
5,Best Purchase Ever.,"For my daughter's 12th birthday, I got her a Nintendo DSi XL and Nintendogs-Dachshund & Friends. Best purchase I've made for her since we got her a REAL dog. Now she has all 4 editions. The graphics are amazing and the whole voice detection with naming them, training them, etc. is AMAZING! I give it 500 stars!"
5,Greastest Game Ever!,"If you like dogs this game is sure to be your favorite! It starts when you adopt your first puppy. You can choose between many breeds. Once you play the game more you unlock more breeds. Once you choose your puppy you get to take it home and name it. After that you can walk your dog, Feed your dog, enter it in contests, play with it, do bark mode, and adopt more dogs. You can keep up to eight dogs. It is a great game and I recommend it!"
1,No offense,"Nintendogs is one of the best games, though I think this version is very odd. Whern I saw it, I thought, Oh, cool I wonder waht dogtgs are in it! Newsflash, you might as well get another version..."
5,get this game ( im 14) ITS GREAT,"ok if your woundering wich 1 of the four games of nintendogz to buy , buy this one because you have the dalmation, you can only get the dalmation on any of the other three games if you find a firemans hat, wich is extreemly hard to find, so GET THIS ONE its limited eddition!hint: you can only walk your dog every 30 minutes,hint: you can only go to compettition 3 times a day per dog, so if ur sucking.......turn the power off the power off before they announce the winners!hint: you can only get eight dogs so id know wich eight id buy before I go buying dogs like thier unlimitedTHIS IS A GREAT GAME ----so buy this limited eddition"
5,AWESOME GAME!,"I bought the Nintendog Dalmation game for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. I haven't seen all the things it can do yet, but it is so cute! She talks to it in the speaker phone and praises him like he's a real dog. You can feed him, walk him, put him through competition, and pet him by rubbing his head with the little pen, and give him a bath. I'm new to these type of games, but it has won my approval for a fun interactive toy. I can see how they can be addictive! I thought by buying this game and a different game (Yoshi Island) my children could share the games since they each have their own ds lite, but I learned that isn't the case with the nintendogs. It isn't recommended to switch out the game into another nintendo ds lite. So, I will be looking for another Nintendog Dalmation for my other daughter! :)"
5,Good option for your kid to really know what to do is you have a Dog,"In the beggining i believed that ""this game is gonna be stupid and simple"", but after a while of playing this with my 9 year old daughter, i can say that is not a game, is a virtual pet, and a very realistic one. I really like that way my daughter is making conscience of taking care of a pet. If you want a game for your kid only to play, don't get nintendogs, if you want a game that can teach something to your kid, get it."
4,this game is SOOOOOO fun!!,"this is a REALLY fun game (I gave it 4 stars because I almost never give things 5 stars) I think that thay put A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of work into this game, it is SOOOOOOOOOO realistic!!!"
4,A lot of fun but requires patience to get going,"My 7yr old son got this for xmas. It's his favorite game for the DS. However, to get going you have to ""train"" your dog with its name, and teach it to sit before you can do anything else. That part was frustrating for him as children don't tend to have much patience. We got through it for him and after that first part, everything else is smooth sailing."
5,Such a cute game!,"First off I am a 21 year old girl. And games such as this appeal to me. I remember when I was 15 my friend had a Nintendogs game and she wouldn't really give me a chance to play very long because it's just so addicting! And now i finally decided to get this for myself after all the years, I have always wanted to start my own game so i can play with my own dogs and name them lol.. From what I remember the graphics are AMAZING. My favorite thing to do was to give the dogs baths it is so fun, cute and realistic. Many people say the game gets boring and I'm sure it does, but it's that type of game that you will put down for about 20 minutes when you're bored and then go right back to it. Who says Nintendogs is for kids? I loved it and I can't wait to get mine in the mail. If you never played before and you love life-like games then you should get this! :)"
4,Very Nice dog's,"It's a funny game and I enjoy that with my Son, we have rihgt now many pets and we follow are the fun's number one of the pets."
5,GREAT!,"Nintendogs has AMAZING graphics. Your dog is so cute!To explain everything about Nintendogs, that would take a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time. So I'm just going to say this:Stuff to do:Adopt dogsPlay with your dogsAccessorize your dogsEnter your dogs in contestsWalk your dogsTrain your dogMake friendsLet your dog play with other dogs in Bark ModeDecorate your houseBuy and sell itemsThis might not seem like a lot, but it is!About the dogs:They stay puppiesYou can keep up to 3 in your houseYou can get up to 8 dogsYou unlock different breedsOut of all my games, this is my ultimate favorite!"
2,too much work to get started,The game requires your child to call the dog's name over and over and over. And over. Unfortunately one cannot progress to the next level until the dog learns his name. My child became very frustrated and cried because the dog kept forgetting his name...not much point in playing it if it makes your kid cry.
2,Hogwash,None other than W. T. Sherman headed an investigation that absolved Forrest. Too many of the events described in gross detail never happened according to the official accounts and in many of cases denied by the participants themselves. Simply another effort to malign the record of the greatest cavalry commander of the War of Northern Aggression.
1,River Runs Red: Ft Pillow Massacre,"This book is listed in the incorrect section as it is pure fantasy!!!!!! I've studied the Ft Pillow incedent for decades and have read accounts from both blue & gray witnesses and never saw anything realted to the so called atrocities mentioned in this piece of sensational fiction!!!!! What a joke!!!!!!!If you are wanting to learn some Tenn. history then save your money on this book. It is a laughable piece of work if it wasn't for the fact that such nut cases as Glenn Beck have featured it in a segment on his conspiracy theory radio show and has passed it off as a legitimate book on history. More proof at why no one should take any of Beck's reports seriously!!!!!Ronny MangrumFranklin, Tenn."
1,A polemic not a narative,"Far too biased with an agenda. Forrest who was praised by both Gen Sherman and Lee for his military prowess is dismmised as a country rube that got lucky in Battle. Sherman's own report to Grant exonerates Forrest in Fort Pillow..The entire tone of the work is so redolent with contempt for Forrest and the Confederacy it might have been written by Harriet Beecher Stowe.Ward goes on about Confederate prisons with no mention of the savagery of Union prisons, where the Union did have food and medicine and simply refused to provide it."
3,A Northern slant.,"In depth analysis of the brutality following the battle. Not an easy book to read, especially so I would think if a person had a Southern background."
1,hi,i ordered this movie off of amazon 2 months ago because my uncle in lebanon wanted it so i ordered it a month and a half in advance and i still have not gotten it this is horrible.
3,"Cool cars, crazy storyline","The title about says it all. It makes ya cringe a little watching them beat up the ""classics"". But as with alot of 70's movies they just put the car on full out and let the cameras roll. You should see it once just for the cars."
2,Not really worth your time,"I'm a big fan of the car chase/road trip cult films from the 1970's, so I thought this film would be worth checking out. I wasn't expecting anything Oscar-worthy or mind-blowing from the script, the dialogue or the plotline, but I was hoping for some decent car chases and/or crashes. I got neither. 'Cannonball Run II' was more enjoyable than this, and HB Halicki's films had better acting and dialogue than this puppy did.It's only worth seeing to cross off the list. I highly doubt anybody would go back for a second viewing. I sure won't."
3,40 year old car stunts,"The movie is 70s period and very campy, but good car stunts. There's also some light gratuitous nudity which I personally appreciate, but that's the way they made movies then."
2,"""Hit the gas,Grasshopper!""","Before David Carradine experienced a career revival of sorts in Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies&crossed; swords with The Bride,Uma Thurman,he was Cannonball,A Man on the Run.The plot is completely nonsensical;it involves a cross-country race.David Carradine gets helped by car geeks,has a strange convenience store brawl,shows off his chest for no reason whatsoever&a; squeaky voiced Marilyn Monroe lookalike goes to bed with an unpleasingly plump bad guy.Okay,it's a cross country race,David Carradine has to win to clear his name--it's good dumb fun.Need I say more?"
1,Hidden Rules of class at work,"Don't waste you time reading this hodge-podge of ill-digested psycho-bable or waste your money buying it. It will tell you nothing of interest or usefulness and it doesn't understand the issues of class at all.And, what is worse, it is extremely poorly written."
3,Only two words... MICHAEL SCHENKER,"And this album is pretty much about him, very long songs with ""thousands"" of solos in each one, which is PERFECT! It's amazing how he at such a young age could play like that. Now this album has been sort of divided: on one side you've amazing instrumental work but lyrically is a bit weak, specially if compared to Fly To The Rainbow, which is sort of a Lonesome Crow II with better vocal and lyric work. The opener (""I'm Going Mad"") and the scary title track are the best numbers. The title track, which weights at 13:30 !!! is surprisingly less boring than some shorter ones, because it gives you the feeling that it has some 5 songs incorporated into one rhapsody and it works pretty well.Good album, but suffers because of some weak numbers, still if you want to hear some magnificent solos, check this one out."
4,Album and band are excellent,Album and band are excellentBut not received my vinyl.I advise no one to buy with importcds.I have a website that I comment on vinyl editions:devoltaparaovinil.blogspot.com.br
3,"Great Album, A Must Have, But............","Great stuff on here, but for Gods sake, let's see a remastered version soon! The sound is way too flat for a gem like this."
4,The Kosmische Influence,"I just want to add to the previous reviews of this album that one cannot forget the musical background were the Scorpions grew up in early seventies' Germany.I have always heard in this album huge influences not only of the british groups but from local Kraut bands like Guru Guru, Brainstorm, Embryo, Cosmic Jockers, Ashra Temple, Tangerine dream and specially Eulenspygel.I even go farther to believe that Aphrodite's Child (Vangelis first project back in 1970) has a lot to do with this record.I have to add up that I totally agree with the fact that this is a remarkable album worth listening to it for at least 100 times."
3,"Scorpions Earliest, searching days.","I've got a vinyl copy of this album that was made in Germany (Brain records) that I purchased new in 1982 and I've listened to it maybe 7 or 8 times. I've been a Scorps fan since 1979 and if you're into them, this album is worth having because it gives you a reference point to see their tremendous growth and musical development. I'd say it has some Cream, Jefferson Airplane, CSN influence, it's the only real ""60's"" sounding Scorps! That's one of the great things about having a large Scorps collection, their albums show such a huge diversity and willingness to be bold that which one you listen to all depends on what mood you're in at the time."
2,Lonesome Crow,This album was released in 1972 only Germany.Klaus Meine and Michael Schenker had just joined his brother Rudolf's band that he had formed in 1965.The album was rereleased in 1983.A rare find in original form with an awsum picture on the front and back The album was also recorded on clear vinyl.The music is definatly scorpions rock however it is primative .
3,Different Taste,"Lonesome Crow was not the first recording from Scorpions I heard, so it was kind of strange hearing progresive rock tunes from a band associated with heavy metal. Because of that, I believe Lonesome Crow is a rare jewel and should be possesd by all heavy metal and Scorpion fans. I know I have it. ;-)"
1,Not as advertised,"The one-star rating is for the Kindle product, not for Steiner's writing.The Kindle product is not the 220-page text as advertised. It consists of 8 ""meditations"" and would probably total about 30 pages of a printed book. (Kindle does not show page breaks.) The printed book contains the 8 meditations (collectively titled ""The Road to Self-Knowledge"") plus a number of other essays collectively titled ""The Threshold of the Spiritual World"".If you want the complete text, you will have to get the printed book. Later editions of the book were printed under the titleA Way of Self-Knowledge: And the Threshold of the Spiritual World, again containing both the 8 meditations plus the Threshold essays.There is a better description of the book under the other title ""Way of Self-Knowledge"", and the price of that title is lower. That title also has a Kindle edition for $15.00, which may include both the meditations and the Threshold essays."
5,One of (if not the) greatest jazz vocal recordings in history,"I've been listening to this album off and on for 35 years, and it continues to astonish. Surely one of a small handful of indispensable jazz recordings of the 20th century..."
5,Wonderful book that encourages you to focus...,"...on the Mysteries of Our Lord's life while praying the Rosary. With each Mystery, St. Escriva adds some thoughts for meditation that are both concise and insightful. He reaches to root of spiritual devotion to the Blessed Mother, and challenges us to conform our life to God's plan."
5,Great !!!,"Though there are many editions of St. Josemaria Escriva's meditations to accompany the rosary prayers. This edition is updated and has meditations for all 20 mysteries, the mysteries of light drawn from the saint's writings on the passages. It also has beautiful woodcuts of each station that can be used for visual focus while meditation upon these scenes from the bible."
1,"Industrial Pressure, Level and Density Measurement",This book covers the basics of the subject material however it is repleat with errors. Equations are sometimes incorrect (page 9). The author mixes tense in the same sentence. From an academic standpoint it is probably O.K.. It is obvious that the author has little practical (or field) experience. Considering the price I cannot reccomend this book as there are many other titles that contain a better treatment of the subject matter.
3,The best just got worse,Cool book but not a patch on the previous edition. The best is still the best but it just got worse. Pity. Needs more groups info in the text.There are few books as good as this but it is not what it used to be.
1,"The truth about the song, Wipe Out","This review is in response to Mr. Bogdanov's book, with the featured Amazon link to p. 557 concerning the song, Wipe Out:* Excerpt from page 557 ""... and arrangement stolen by the Surfaris, who had a huge hit ...""Unfortunately, this is suggestive, and thus misleading information concerning the song, written and recorded by the Surfaris in 1962. The four members in the studio that December night were Ron Wilson, Pat Connolly, Jim Fuller and Bob Berryhill. This is a well-known fact, legally proven beyond any doubt. Anyone claiming that the Surfaris stole Wipe Out from them is sadly disillusioned. Check out this article written for the Wall Street Journal by staff writer, Phil Kuntz to read the story behind Wipe Out and the Surfaris at: http://www.polarity1.com/pcrr2.html. The article is also in a book titled, Floating Off the Page: The Best Stories From the Wall Street Journal's ""Middle Column"" by Ken Wells, also available on Amazon."
5,Impossible not to like,"Unless you hate basketball, teenagers, Gene Hackman, or Indiana, it's impossible not to fall for this movie. It's one of the best feel-good movies ever made. We've got David vs. Goliath (the winning school only has about 65 kids in it); loyalty galore, especially with the star player refusing to play at first out of mistaken respect for the dead coach who preceded Hackman; an almost reformed alcoholic in Dennis Hopper with great basketball brains despite the fatal flaw; a little romance with Hackman and another teacher; and mystery (Hackman has a clouded past). What more could you want? The picture plays to our simplest emotions, and when it's over we cheer like crazy. Who cares if we've been had."
2,Why Subtitles?,I need to send this dvd back to you. It has subtitles in French. It does not say anything about this on the packaging nor did I order it this way. I was not satisfied with this dvd. I will ship it back and exchange it for a dvd in English with no subtitles. Sandra Birchfield
4,Classic Basketball at It's Best,Basketball and for that matter any sports minded person should have this as part of their collection to show future grand children. It was how high school basketball can be the focal point of any small town. Sure it is corny at times but that was life back then when life seemed a little simpler. I truly believe that this was one of Gene Hackman's best acting performances.
5,Great Movie,Great movie to watch with the family or ball team. Some mild cursing but a touching inspirational story based on true events that's sure to get everyone on the team fired up and ready to give it their all.
2,Underachieving film about overachievers,"This film starts out promisingly with some beautiful photography showing Indiana in the fall. It soon bogs down to repetitious basketball footage and cliche characters going about their wretched lives pointlessly. If you like shots of basketballs bouncing off of backboards, this film might be entertaining. To me, it was like being hit in the face continually with a basketball for the better part of two hours.Oh well, it beats watching the NBA."
1,Mon Dieu!,"This must be the worst, most pathetic film I have seen. I bought this movie because I like Gene Hackman. The movie is boring and slow moving. I have never been to Indiana, and now I am sure I NEVER wish to go there. The movie is full of drab, dull, lifeless and bleak scenes. The acting is okay, and the music is good. What is so exciting about a school winning a state championship? This happens all the time. Why do they make a movie of this? I highly suggest NOT purchasing this movie. This movie is a total waste of time and money. I would have rated it with zero stars, but it would not let me do that."
2,"Buy the 2-disc Collector's Edition, not the Blu-Ray","Buying the blu-ray of this cherished film is a veritable waste of money. Pitiful transfer. I almost sold my 2-disc Collector's Edition after buying the blu-ray; then I saw the blu-ray version I'd purchased and wisely kept the Collector's Edition.No extras to speak of (unless you like the trailers) with the blu-ray edition. The Collector's Edition has the original game and plenty of deleted scenes. Someone here mentioned that it was an older film so it couldn't be transferred well: tell that to the people who redid the 1951 ""A Christmas Carol."" It can be done. It just takes time, care, and money.I see the price of the blu-ray has gone down to $8. What a surprise..."
5,great basketball movie,"My husband loved this movie and especially the extra sceens. He's a big high school basketball fan, and this was a great story."
1,"Love the movie, hate the dvd we received","Purchased this dvd for my son's birthday because he loves basketball and we wanted to share the experience of watching this great basketball movie with him. Although it was a brand new dvd, it skipped and froze up several times and the sound quality was terrible. I don't know if this was some kind of bootleg, but I won't watch this dvd version of Hoosiers again."
4,Hoosiers - the best sprots movie around,This is the best sprots that I have ever seen. The producers probably did the movie an injustice with the decision not to include some of the deleted scenes that are on the feature DVD. Specifically the harvest scene and the scene where Buddy is allowed back on the team. The movie makers were very smart to use actual basketball players - the athletic action was superb. Buy the DVD set.
3,Feel good sports flick,"Essentially this is just another feel good sporting movie. The focus is on the coach, and there's no real connection gained with the players in this under dog team. It's old-school style makes a change from some of the other modern sports films going around, and it's definitely worth a Sunday afternoon viewing. There's no amazing sports filming in this movie, but as I said the plot is decent and it is family friendly."
5,"Hackman-Great Actor, Terrible Bench Coach","Hoosiers could be the greatest sports movie ever that's not named Raging Bull. Hackman does a great job selling Norman Dale as the disgraced college coach who moves to the middle of nowhere to escape his past. His coaching techniques and the basketball styles of the players are period appropriate and the ending, though predicatble, is still immensely enjoyable.My only complaint reality wise is Hackman's ineffectiveness as a bench coach. For a guy who seems to be considered an Xs and Os guy, Norman Dale doesn't get into the nitty gritty. I think I would have done a little more zone to force the guys from South Bend to shoot from the outside. I also probably would have done a little more pick and roll and back cut a la Pete Carrill and Princeton."
4,Houps Du Jour!,"A wonderful and personal movie with Gene Hackman reminding us what he can do with a nice little script. This is because ..you see Hackman isnt acting at all. He is the coach. Hackman is one of those rare gifted actors who can transmit and emotion with his face and no dialogue at all.He as ably supported by Barbara Hershy and Dennis Hopper.In this film Hackman produces a wide range of elements, Pathos, anger, resolve, patience et all. For sure its a feel good movie in the last reel..but how you get there is top drawer. !"
5,"I grew up 10 minutes from ""Hickory""","Anyone with a heart will love this movie. And anyone with a hoop in their backyard will cry a river when Jimmy hits the jumper from the top of the key to win it all, and Shooter (Dennis Hopper) triumphantly tells his nurse over and over . . . ""No team this small has ever been to a state championship!!!"" Well, give it a go, you can't score if you don't shoot."
5,Let's hope the studio reads these reviews!,"Hoosiers is a classic sports movie, so good, that the viewer can't help but want it required viewing in all the locker rooms of today's spoiled sports stars. Hackman is great, Barbara Hershey poignant, and Dennis Hopper tragic in this ""based on a true story"" movie(though not mentioned in the credits). Having been raised in Indiana, even I was impressed with the beauty of the location filming, with music scored to match. My copy is starting to show wear and tear: STUDIO, bring it back!"
4,Part of my 100000 mile tune up,"this is a piece of my 100000 mile tune up, fast delivery and quality product...now if they just had somebody to help install"
4,"Good product, does the job","Hard to beat a stable product like this one, does the job well and there is enough in the tube to last a while."
4,Permatex 81343 Anti-Seize Lubricant 133,"Use this product if you're going to be installing spark plugs, cylinder head and exhaust head bolts for easy removal later. I'm a novice mechanic so this tube will probably last me a while, wish it came in a smaller tube and it included brush. Overall, its a good product, I'd buy it again."
4,Did as it was suppose too,Used this when replacing my spark plugs and worked fine. Should be more than enough said.
5,spark plug antiseize lubricant.,Must have. Apply to threads of spark plug for easy removal next time around. Screw spark plug in to the torque suggested by manufacturer and apply permatex dielectri tune-up grease to spark plug boot (both ends of spark plug wires). Don't forget to replace oxygen sensors!
5,Among my very favorites,"These Columbia Brewha shorts are among my very favorite knock-around shorts. These are suitable for boating, fishing, knocking around town on nice days, or going to the Yacht Club. They are very well-made, with the pockets in the right places without looking overly utilitarian. The fabric in these shorts has a pleasing, substantial feel while still managing to be light and comfortable. I have bought numerous pair and wear them often. I have worn these while vacationing in Hawaii, boating along the California coast, hanging around California beach towns, and to nice California casual restaurants, and they always make a fine impression and are comfortable besides. Highly recommended. RJB."
4,Great Product!,"I practically live in these, and I have 5 pairs. The zipper is a little weak; the pull tab can break off, and button can pop off if you're too fat for the size you're wearing. 1 pair should last 2-4 years."
3,About average,"These are good shorts, but not nearly the utility, design or materials of the discontinued Cliff Lakes from Columbia. I go through three or so pairs of these each year. Yeah, basically live in them much of the year. Hiking, biking, whatever. Probably will shop around for something better."
2,You can find better,"There are better shorts out there - these felt rough, not soft or comfy, and too heavy. The waistband was not smooth and was distinctly uncomfortable with a backpack on."
3,Good but not great,"These are good quality shorts from an experienced producer. The material is heavy duty and the pocket designis not as utilitarian as their Platimum series shorts. Also, the sizing runs large, so the shorts Ibought should have been marked one size larger.Overall, after trying a few times, I ordered several pairs of the Platium series shorts instead."
3,"Bad zippers, cloth gets thinner every year","I have five pairs of Brewha's at any given time, have been wearing them for around 10 years. The zippers inevitably break after a year, or so ($15), and the cotton material gets lighter and thinner every year. I have a a couple of pairs from 5 years ago that are much heavier than whatever they are using now. I like the style, but they have gone from heavyweight to medium weight to lighweight, a cost-cutting measure, no doubt."
5,straight talk on investing,VERY GOOD BOOK. GOOD PRODUCT GOOD PRICE FAST SHIPPING HIGHLY RECOMMEND GREAT BOOK FOR LEARNING OR REVIEWING INVESTMENTS. EXCELLENT FOR BEGINNER OR PERSON OF NEXT LEVEL.
2,Heard on Wall Street Week,"Haven't read the book, but will. He spoke on WSW tonight and made good plain sense, without hype."
4,"Entertaining, probing, insightful & constantly enlightening.","In this, her first book, Ms. Murchison proves herself to be an accomplished wordsmith. Her collection of interviews, and perspectives on relationships were well researched and chronicled. The ""news"" she brings forth regarding our relationships is not always good, but it is certain to entertain, occasionally agitate, and constantly enlighten."
5,Great shampoo if you have white hair,I have completely white hair. This is a great shampoo to keep it white. It somehow brightens my white up again. It is also gentle enough that you can use it daily. My hair salon recommended it - they use it at their salon. I tried many products to try to keep the hair white. This one actually works and without all that yucky purple color many of them have. I love it.
1,Fast orange waterless hand cleaner,"I like the product. It gets your hands clean without drying them out. I Bought a box of 6 and whoever packed them for shipping, put the box of six in the shipping box upside down. 3 of the lids came off and the cleaner was all over the inside of the box. I wasn't impressed at all. I wrote to Amazon about their packaging but as of yet haven't got a reply. The cleaner would be worth the price if it was shipped right."
3,"Great cleaner, for daily use.","By saying for daily use, what I mean is, if you let this sit for weeks without using it, it will dry out. It's a large container so I recommend it only for shops with several guys that need it daily. The dispenser leaves a bit to be desired since the container is not secured to the dispenser. It all works on gravity so try not to bump it or off it goes, MESSY! Also, you have to drill or cut a hole in the top so the gravity pulling down on the cleaner does not create a vacuum inside the container. If it does it will pop itself off the dispenser, MESSY!"
4,It's a useful book,"If you need to understand or study aobut the KM knowledge ,here is your choice.easy to understanding and reading!"
1,Busted,"After weeks of changing speakers, messing with settings, and swapping devices, I've decided that this cable was damaged in transit, or was junk to begin with. When using this cable I only receive sound from my left channel, while my PS3, which uses a different cable, delivers to all channels. It's too late now to return, and for $.90 it isn't worth the hassle."
5,Play your MP3s through your stereo,"If you want to play music from your phone or MP3 player through your home stereo, this is exactly what you need. Just plug in the 3.5mm plug into the headphone jack on your phone or ipod, and plug the red and white RCA ends into the red and white AUX or CD inputs on your stereo or amplifier, push the CD or other appropriate input control on the amp, and you're good to go. The five foot cable allows you to hold your phone/ipod several feet away if you want to. The wires are sturdy but pliable. The price is low and there was no shipping when I ordered. Can't ask for more."
2,Fell apart instantly on first use,"I have purchased many a Chinese made cheapo cable. You get what you pay for generally, however these snapped instantly and left the pieces inside my player."
5,Works As Expected,For the price it works great. We are actually still using it after a few years. It is great for the price that we paid. I would recommend it if you need one.
5,arrived early worked perfectly,"This is something that you can normally pick up at your local Radio Shack or electronics section of some store. If you're stuck somewhere that has no local stores say, like a base in the Middle East and the cable from your stereo equipment at work started to come apart, this is the perfect place to go! It came early and worked perfectly. I could not have been happier about this purchase (except not needing it in the first place)"
5,A New Vies of Shelley,"At last someone had the guts to write a contemporary Dracula without the silly bite in the neck, stake in the heart theme. Congratulations, Schildt! We hope to see many more just like this. I liked ""Frankenstein: The Legacy,"" but this one is even better."
4,"A must for the series reader, but not the most exciting.....","Not the most action packed of the novels, however, the storyline and history are as always fun to follow..."
3,"Not the best, but more to come","O'Brian is never dull, of course, but this installment is too didactic for me. Where before Maturin's naivete is a natural cue for exploration of many topics, here it's just too obviously a chance for P O'B to display his astounding reasearch skills.But the thread of Aubrey & Maturin's shared life remains compelling, and it surely has the best ""cliffhanger"" ending of the series so far. When does the next one come out?"
2,O'Brian is running out of steam. So what?,"There is an awful lot of recycling going on in this book. The research is still prodigious, but I suspect at this point O'Brian has the topography and culture of early 19th Century Europe so much a part of him that he is now on automatic pilot. Well, he's entitled at this point. As usual, situations and characters are introduced, then never heard from or of again. Maturin's naivete is a more than a bit tiresome at this point. Nonetheless, I look forward to the next one and see how Jack deals with Napoleon."
3,The freshness goes; among the least inspired of the series,"For those of us who have avidly followed the exploits and conversations of O'Brian's remarkable characters, ""The Yellow Admiral""is a disappointment. Just as the Napoleonic wars have gone flat in this episode, so, too, has the world Aubrey and Maturin. For the firsttime I had the feeling that the author was uncertain where to take the tale. Perhaps the characters have now grown too much within themselvesand thus find very little that is fresh in their world. In any event, in this story the sheer joy of life and discovery, and the thrill ofcompetence that is theirs at sea, is gone, gone, gone. Sour elder middle-age seems to have taken their place.For those who have followed this series, of course, ""The Yellow Admiral"" is a must read. But were it not for the long association withthese characters, I would have found the book tedious, undirected, and boring."
3,"If you got this far in the series, why stop now?","Aubrey & Maturin will always be worth reading, butthis series is definitely getting tired. Afterthe first three or four books, O'Brian started strugglingand this novel continues the long, long downhill path.For alternatives, try the grandaddy of them all, theHornblower series by C.S. Forester, or the Bolitho storiesfrom Alexander Kent. Harder to find, try the Drinkwaterseries from Richard Woodman (e.g., ""An Eye of the Fleet"")or the Ramage series from Dudley Pope. On land, BernardCornwell's Sharpe is pretty good too."
2,Conrad O'Brian gets lost,"This last in the series was obviously thrown together. I believe that O'Brian said he was not going to write any more than 21...this is an afterthought. The story is erratic and themes are left un-solved. Apart from that, for afficiandos its worth picking up."
1,Not a pleasant experience,"While a more than adequate insight into everyday life in the England of George III, this book serves the uninitiated reader of O'Brian's work poorly. Nothing much takes place during the story, and what little as does, takes place offstage, as it were. Characters and events are introduced that lead no where and serve no purpose other than to fill the page. While the real world is often like that, works of art are not the real world, and novels are not documentaries. I was grossly disappointed in this book, as I had read such wonderful things about this series, and I will give O'Brian another chance, but I did not find any charcters other than Aubrey and Maturin to be given any definition, and their characters were more described than shown. Reading The Yellow Admiral (a pretentious title providing no insight into the plot nor encouragement to the reader) was not a pleasant experience."
5,Theology & Sanity,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who believes in God and would like to understand better what that might entail. If you're not sure about God, this book may lead you to him and help fill the void in your life."
5,Powerful work by the streetcorner apologist,"Sheed does a fine job here of concisely presenting the entire Catholic worldview in a single volume. His explanation of difficult philosophical and theological concepts (i.e. the Trinity) is done in a manner that can be easily understood by those with less expertise in these areas. This book is really a valuable piece, and should be on the bookshelves and in the minds of all Catholics."
4,Great insights,"This book provides wonderful insights into what Catholics believe, with supporting arguments and justification. If you have ever been at a loss to explain your faith, you should read this book. It's written for lay people, not religious scholars, so it's pretty easy to understand."
5,Masterfull beyond the common theological attempts,"Reading Theology and Sanity is like reading C.S.Lewis, G.K.Chesterton,Pascal, Aquinas, Augustine, Kreeft,Schumacker combined to make a magisterial simple, yet not simplistic volume of essential theology. Every thinker can not afford to miss the joy that comes as a result of reading Sheed's work. It is utterly stunning. Protestants and Catholics alike may have a taste of what C.S. Lewis called:The serious business of heaven, namely, Joy. Sheed is one of my giants....thank God for himDavid Valencia"
4,No Problems,The material was as described and was delivered on schedule. The packaging was less than adequate since the bar broke through one end cap of the shipping tube. Otherwise it would be five stars.
5,Groundbreaking CD!!!!,"Sasha is the master and if you haven't gone to see him play live then you haven't gone to see the Grand Master of Mixing! Giant 2007 he played so so so so so good and brought the night to a heartpounding finish, definitely one of the best DJ's in the Universe! This CD brings you through almost a dream like state, used to play video games to it because it make you concentrate and sucks you into the beats. If you don't have this CD then you need to get it now!"
2,the truth....I don't know what these guys are on when they,listen to this music...garbage...I don't know what Sasha was on when he mixed this...Involver more sleek and sexy...
2,I gave this CD away...,"I found this CD to be repetitive, boring, and unenlightening. The image on the cover is what my brain felt like after listening to this album. I prefer creative music that has something worthy to convey. Sasha falls flat in this regard. But hey, I guess we all have to make a living somehow..."
2,terrible,"Sasha is always top rank 10, I went to see him at Roxy and Crobar NYC, live he's awesome but he cannot make good CD's, I am sure some people love his CD's. But for me his CD's make me sleep, too slow like a lounge for people sit down and have a drink. I prefer John digweed."
1,garbage,"This is such a disappointment. None of the complex, bassy rhythms of Xpander. It sounds like a kid playing with one of those casio keyboards. I hope the next one is back to the old style."
1,bad ambient music,"after all the great mixes over the years, this is a horrible disapointment. i am already selling this back used."
2,not that great,"this isn't as good as sasha has been in the past. it's growing on me a little, but i really think that airdrawndagger tends to be a bit on the boring side. i'd borrow it from a buddy before buying it."
2,Over- hyped reviews.,"I don't get all the accolades for this piece. Like all things, it must be related to temperament. Just more synthetic pounding bass and trance-type rhythm."
2,Not the Sasha I know.........,"Consider this one in the chillout category. You won't hear any Xpander, Global Underground, club type sounds you would expect from this master. This is his first artist album and it shows how much he experiments with lots of almost ambient type of soundscapes. Really beautiful music but just really not my type. That is why I only gave it 2 stars."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"I was very excited about this disc. I have all of the Sasha/Digweed and Global Underground CDs and I knew what to expect. At least I thought so. Sasha seems to have reverted to 80s synthesizer music that has no purpose. A decent beat doesn't make itself known until the 4th song. I can't get rid of this CD fast enough. Normally I give these CDs some time to ""grow on me,"" but not with this one. My suggestion--give this CD some serious thought before you purchase. I'm very disappointed..."
5,Great CD,"This cd is diverse, and very easy to listen to, as it flows from track to track. I highly recommend it."
5,Simply sublime,This is a richly textured CD that defies categorization. Your ears and mind will love it.
5,Great album,"I have been listening to this album for the last year, over and over, and I am still not sick of it. This is one of the best albums I have in any genre. I listen to it working out, driving, working in the house, anywhere. It is, in one word, awesome."
5,WOW,"This is quite simply the best single electronic album I have ever heard. Even friends who aren't into electronic can get into this album. The track transitions are seamless, as this album absolutely reflects the time Sasha invested in it."
5,w..w.. WOW,"It's trance music that doesn't make me want to ""smash my portable CD player to smithereens."" probably some of the best, most subtle, acoustic, almost organic electro pop background muzak I've ever heard! If you like this look into jpop, nobukazu takemura, Weekend Players, and maybe the Postal Service. good!"
2,Expected More!,"I enjoy Sasha as much as the next person, I loved all the GU releases however I was a little dissappointed with the first Artist release by Sasha. Although it has some brilliant moments, I was dissappointed that no where in the album did I say to myself ""that's freaking brilliant!"" If your looking for a more subdued sasha...this is it, but it lacks the sasha ""stamp"" of trademark boogie. Borrow a friends but not worth your investment dollar...."
3,Great music if you can't fall asleep....,"Airdrawndagger is not your conventional ""club"" album and the usual 4-step monotony relegated to most dance mixes is abandoned in favor of a more experimental sound. From break-beats to progressive, Airdrawndagger dabbles in different realms of ""electronic"" music...much to the album's detriment. In an attempt to please all parties, Sasha spreads himself to thin.Airdrawndagger has its moments of beauty, yet the massively layered and effects-driven symphony of synths becomes droll after a while. There's only so much pseudo-ambiance one can take.In conclusion, if you seek a boisterous cacophony of high-octane dance music to ready your soul for that clubbing experience, pass over Airdrawndagger. On the contrary, you should save this for that reflective moment of time afterwards when you wonder why you spent so much money... ;)"
2,Where is Sasha?????,"I don't know what went wrong, but latest albums from the best djs like Sasha and Paul Oakenfold are really far away from the ""magic music"" they used to play for the global underground series, they became kings in the field of progressive house and for any reason they started to explore in others different fields.This new album from Sasha unfortunately is not what we all his fans were expecting, be ready for chill out, the party is over!!!"
2,Bleeds potential....but needs work,"I was kind of looking forward to this album ,considering everything i had heard about it, so i listented to it 2 times all the way through and wanted to break someting. It is overall a very relaxing album that peaks nicely with spots of genius, but the whole album seemed choppy from song to song. The Quiet parts were too long and tempted me a lot to fast forward,and the worst part is that the good parts are so good that it almost seems like two different people were making this album. Who ever made this album obviously has enough talent to do a little better. Part of me thinks that this was just some exrcise in editing and production to try to push the boundries of what one could call an album."
1,oh no...,"Well, I guess this is just not my cup of tea. I was expecting something along the lines of ""Xpander."" Really not sure what to think of this album. At this point, I can't even force myself to give it a second listen."
5,Fresh,Once in a while an album comes out that sparks your imagination and gets you excited again about the music you love. This is that album. Airdrawndagger is truly a breath of fresh air. Thank you Sasha.
4,Bissell's book is best read in tandem with Garrard's book.,"I plan to use both the Bissell and the Garrard book on Artemisia Gentileschi in my Baroque Art History class this Spring. Since these authors often interpret both works and life events rather differently, students should find the comparison stimulating."

3,"Extremely useful, but extremely hard to get through","This book is of great importance to me - Peperzak addresses many nuances in Levinas' thought I wouldn't find myself. However there is a catch: the language used by Peperzak is quite difficult to understand and get through. I don't mean the depth of thought, metaphorical language or anything like that. It's just Peperzak's English which is quite crude and rough. I highly doubt this book had a good proof reading it really deserves. Maybe it's just me, since I'm not English native speaker, but if you're feeling you English skills are not good, you may be disappointed after buying this book.P.S. My critique refers mainly to chapter ""A Key to Totality and Infinity""."
2,Interesting to compare with Gertrude the Great.,"Mechtilde's perspective is different from that of other Christian mystics, in that she was a Beguine, and entered the convent at a much later age than Gertrude.The work can be hard to follow, the style hard to grasp, but it is a worthy academic challenge."
5,A Classic Must Have,"We recently purchased this 2 disc Special Collection DVD. We love this movie and we are very glad to now own it. I think they did a good job with the ""Extras"" in the 2nd disc taking into consideration the age of the movie and all pieces collected for the Extras. We always like to see whatever they have that has happened behind the scenes while making the movie and how it all came about. The movie is a great classic of course and a winner. This is definitely a keeper for our collection and I highly recommend it."
5,Makua'i mea lelei lava!!!,I've always enjoyed this movie but would always have a hard time trying to find it anywhere until I came to amazon. This is the type of movie that you watch over and over again and never get tired of watching it. Tom Hanks is hilarious in this film. Great movie!!!!
5,Wonderful Historical picture,"This movie is a masterpiece. It belends The history of the AAGPBL seemlessly with the music of Hans Zimmer, Billy Joel and more, as well as the amazing acting. I think that probably the best character as well as performence in this movie goes to Megan Cavanaugh as Marla Hooch. If you see the deleted footage on the wonderful DVD, you see her playing for Raciene looking like a beauty, nothing like her ugly duckling start in Colorado. I also props have to be given to Lori Petty for her performance as Kit.Penny Marshall does a wonderful job of directing this film. If you don't cry at the end you are not human.And if all this doesn't convince you, Madonna has one of her only 2 good acting performances in this movie!"
3,Hey batta batta,"You wouldn't be too wrong choosing ""A League of Their Own"" if looking for a baseball comedy. Actually, it's more of a ""dramadey,"" like a mixture of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" and ""Pride of the Yankees,"" only with girls, girls, girls!WWII is in progress, all the boys are fighting, so a candy bar tycoon (Jon Lovitz, ""The Benchwarmers"" and, uh, ""Happiness"") decides to start a girls' league. He sends out some scouts who find Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Cavenagh who all try out for the Rockford Peaches, owned by Walter Harvey (Gary Marshall, ""Pretty Woman,"" the director's father).Tom Hanks plays the team's coach, former baseball great, Jimmy Dugan, sort of an alcoholic George Bailey.The film is entertaining -- it features the standard rivalries between teammates, and has some well-made game montages, leading up to the World Series showdown. It's a little too sentimental at times, but for the most part ""A League of Their Own"" is fun."
3,hoping for great,bought as part of christmas gift so havent opened it yet. I am hoping for the best. love this movie hope I am not disappointed
5,GREAT,"Great movie, you don't even have to be into sports to like this movie. Tom Hanks does a brilliant job and Madonna is great, she is a great actress. MUST HAVE"
4,Great Storyline,"During World War II there is a shortage of men to fill the slots of the baseball teams. Because of this women begin to get recuited and thus we have the storyline for this outstanding film.I think Penny Marshall did a great job with this movie. Genna Davis, the basic star brought much realism as we watch a bunch of talented ladies battle for a place in sporting history.Marshall makes it personal by giving us some great insight into the lives of these women and the challenges they faced to be part of the first Girls Professinal Baseball Team.I was a little disappointed at the ending, but all in all I think this was a very good movie.Shirley Johnson"
