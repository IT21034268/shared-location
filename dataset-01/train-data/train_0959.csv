1,no buy,"the book is not at all thorough, but is thumb nails of so called hybrid buildings. There is no distinction between mixed use projects and hybrid buildings. hybrid buildings is relatively a new concept but buildings from the sixties are cited as examples. A no no buy."
1,Unwatchable,"Bad acting, bad cinematography, uninteresting characters made this impossible to get more than five minutes into before turning it off."
3,Almost what you would expect,"These speakers are pretty good for cheap-o's. Sure the sound could be way better, but it really could be much worse. They are not tinny and don't have static noises. If you are a gamer or listen to music through your computer you need to spend more money than this. Otherwise, these speakers will be just fine.The only real disappointment is that these speakers are all about wires... they are hooked together with wires, you have to plug them into the wall AND you plug them into the tower.Just a lot of messy wires... I would much prefer not having to plug these into the wall.. its a pain."
4,A good page turner,Our book club read this book and liked it. Easy to read and get into the story of this man's extraordinary life. It also gives the perspective views of important family and friends.
1,Boring,"I bought this game for my 5 yrs old daughter.I thought it might be fun to print those items and build by herself.But after I install the game. It's very boring.There are very few features/pictures for each activity.About 2 or 3.The color will go outside the picture lines easily and make my daughter feel sad.(Even me can't make the color only inside the lines)The background theme pictures are ugly, kids don't like them.Only the color for crayons is good, colorful.Although the price is very cheap now.I still think it's wasting money.Kid's don't like it!"
3,At One Part It Dosen't Sound Like A Thunderstorm.,"The reason why I'm giving this tape 3 out of 5 stars is because at one part in the tape, for a while the thunder and the rain stopps and it dosen't sound like a rainstorm at all. It actually sounds like a backyard right after a rainstorm. But the rest is fine. Something I DO like about this tape is that it constantly changes types of rainfall. It's either a lot of rain or it's little rain, but more up-close so the raindrops can make that sound I love so much."
3,Serious Storm,"This CD starts with a sharp clap of thunder followed by another. For that reason alone, it makes this CD unsuitable for sleeping to (IMO). However, once that passes, the sound of a good rain hitting hard wet ground/pavement is pretty nice. Further into the CD, the rain recording goes from ground level to normal level as we hear a hard rain coming from the sky with plenty of thunder in the background and some of that coming in sharp claps.This CD isn't edited as well as others which knocks it from a 4 to a 3. Still, I don't regret this purchase."
4,LB Evans Mesa Shearling Moccasin Slippers,"Excellent quality and very comfortable. The soles are as advertised- no problem to run outside and get the mail, etc.while wearing them. These do not come in 1/2 sizes so mine are a little big in the heel, but adjusting the laces makes this no big deal. The memory insole was not quite as cushy as I'd expected, but it's still a very comfortable shoe. I am happy with my purchase."
2,Choose a Size Up,"The slippers were well made and even looked comfortable, but the size was far too small for the size it was described as. If you are a size ten in shoes plan to order at least size eleven if not twelve. I expected them to perhaps be snug and to stretch over time but I felt like a circus act to try to put these on. They obviously went back."
3,Men's Slippers,"Nice slippers but if you have wide feet becareful, we only had these slippers for a few days and the side split out, but these are very nice."
2,Misrepresenting an Ad for this product.,"It states on the site that the Revlon Eterna '27' costs $19.99 for ""6 ounces;"" however, the box states only ""2 ounces."" BUYER BEWARE! If it is 6 ounces for $19.99, it's a good price, but not for 2 ounces."
3,Just Okay,"These bells are okay...some have jingles, and some don't, but overall I am alright with them. Could be a bit stronger quality."
4,And it works with fine with Excel,"An update to my earlier review: Filemaker works great with Excel (contrary to what an earlier reviewer guessed, apparently without testing). Last week I built a small Filemaker database to track contributors and potential contributors to a charitable group with which I work. Yesterday, I received an Excel spreadsheet from another member of the group, and it contained nearly 1,000 names, addresses, and phone numbers. Importing it was a snap: I simply used the ""Import"" function, choosing Excel as the file-type I wanted to import. Filemaker gave me a nice graphical interface to match Excel columns to fields in my database; it also gave me the chance to add a new field if necessary. Then a button click and the data imported cleanly and quickly, without any problems."
4,A good read about the reel life,"I liked this book. The premise is basically: What if a Quentin Tarrantino/Oliver Stone-script comes to live and the direcor stars in it. To be honest, I was a bit disapointed by the end, because for my taste it was a bit to much moral fingerpointing. But all the stuff before that: excellent."
3,An Extreme Punch In The Face,"I read the book about 5 weeks ago. The situations and the plot in the story are predictable and yet at the same time it attempts to a make a good point on who takes responsibility for their actions? I think the issue here is who do we blame for all of America's viloence? We all know that it is the people who comit actual violence are to blame and yet a lot of people in the media tend to blame film directors because it is easy. By the end of the story, I couldn't accept seeing Bruce exiled into another country due to the invasion of two mass killers. And what also I couldn't accept is seeing the media and the police acting like sickos as though they were no better than the criminals. The point didn't seem very clear. It ended up sounding like everyone is to blame, and I can't accept that as true. It is a good, funny story, but it would not come across or presented as a thought provoking story. Cheers! Rebbecca McGarity"
4,A great thriller but not many laughs.,"This is Ben Elton's 4th book and is the first without an environmental message . This instead concentrates on the violence in society as portrayed by movies and asks some important questions about personal responsibility. It works on three levels; as a straight thriller, as a satire and as a moral arguement. It never however provides any answers but just leaves you to think about whether films reflect or lead the mood of society. As a thriller it is excellent with some real heart stopping scenes. I would imagine the play currently running in London would be great as all the action takes place in one room. It did not however make me laugh and for a comedy writer as good as he is that disappointed me. if you have never read an Elton book before then can I recommend Gridlock which deals with car pollution and also disability awareness as well as providing more belly laughs than this."
2,Popped Out,"I loved Elton's ""Blind Faith"" and thought that ""Chart Throb"" was pretty good too. Other reader friends had recommended ""Popcorn"" to me, so I was looking forward to another humorous read. Sorry to say, but I just didn't get into this one. I was very annoyed by the blatant Tarrantino-like over-the-top violence and endless film references. Not remotely entertaining or funny."
3,Good,"Well this is obviously about Tarrantino and the wave of violent / shocking but somehow funny and cool films that have hit us recently. And it's a fair comment. Gets you thinking about the issue and is an easy read, yet lacks somewhat in substance."
1,A sloppily-written and unsatisfying novel.,"Ben Elton's popcorn is a half-baked story that manages to combine shoddy writing with a plotline taken from NATURAL BORN KILLERS and a heavy-handed appraisal of a ""pressing social issue"" (the effect of the media on violence in society.) Trashy, unenlightening. POPCORN is right; this is the kind of book that you digest quickly, then grumble when it gives you an upset stomach."
2,Dinner conversation,"I imagine Elton coming up with the idea for this book after an evening of ""stimulating"" dinner conversation with friends on the topic of ultraviolence in film. To be frank, while somewhat entertaining, I found the treatment of the subject matter pretty trite, predictable, and oriented on the sound bite. Really nothing that you haven't heard before if you're at all paying attention, so I wouldn't recommend reading it for its more philosophical aspects."
3,Darker than you expect -- proceed with caution!,"Having loved Ben Elton's television work, I thought I knew what to expect from a novel of his...a lighthearted romp that would have me rolling. I could not have been more wrong.This novel is not funny. You may chuckle once or twice at some good lines, but it's not funny. It's dark, brooding, and at its heart serious. It's a great satire, poignant and thoughtful. But it's not a comedy by any means.If you want a good, biting look at Hollywood and its current direction, read the book. But be prepared to think."
4,Compelling satire,"While I found this an entertaining and amusing book, I couldn't help but think what a great movie it would make. Ironic that I felt this way? I suppose but then I read in the back of the book that Elton was working on the screenplay. I can't wait to see the film."
4,A text-only version of Quentin Tarantino,"A hysterically funny novel in the style of Quentin Tarantino, while at the same time also making fun of this genre (which ultimitely includes itself).The underlying comments about the victim, `pass on the responsibility to somebody else' philosophy taking over American society are sharp and poignant, and the ideas behind this mode of reasoning are very well satirized.Overall a great book, well worth reading."
3,Early work shows promise,"The forward said that this collection of short stories was PKD's early work and it shows. I had problems with some of his endings but found the majority of the stories enjoyable. I should also mention that not all of the stories are really science fiction. I am, however, looking forward to reading some of the later works by (...) to see the development of the author."
3,Needs extra work to make it useful,"This is an interesting instrument. Very close in sound to a Clarinet, fingering is almost the same too. The brass finish is sparkly and having two choices of necks (straight and curved) helps you find the most comfortable way to pay. On the cons, the corks were extremely thin and had to be replaced in order to fix air leaks. Also, had to send to a music repair shop just after I bought it to adjust the keys to made it sound better, again there were air leaks everywhere, not very well built. Also, if you are a beginner, better buy a Clarinet (easier to keep intonation) or an Alto Sax (easier to play). Soprano Saxs are definitely for experienced players."
5,If spiritual growth of children is important to you,"Very readable - good for parents and college students planning to work with children. Shows how spiritual growth parallels developmental growth - what can a child of 3 understand about God? What spiritual concepts should a 4th grader be able to grasp and engage in? I've used this book both as a children's pastor and as a textbook in a children's ministries course I teach - I highly recommend it. Even though it's out of print, it's worth the search if you can find it - they should reprint it!"
3,active time limited,"I placed 2 of these lights outside to light an address sign and stairs leading to our home. I installed them at the beginning of November. The lights come on at dusk. After about an hour the lights start to dim. After about 2 hours they are almost off. This time of year I need them to work for 4 or 5 hours and they are not getting the job done. I live in San Francisco and we still have some nice sunny days but it seems 2 hours is about their maximum. Maybe they'll be better with the increased sunshine in the spring, but then the fog will start."
2,disappointing,"Although the lights are nice looking and easily put together,one would not work out of the box, and periodically goes out evenafter the original finagling to get it to work."
2,Too dim!,"These lights are useful only for marking a path. They don't provide enough light so that you can actually see the path. I need lights for the back yard but the dim light they exude is merely enough to view the lamp, not enough to cast actual light on the ground (even after days of charging in the sun).The flaw seems to be in the plastic 'windows' which block too much light; when I looked at the LED inside, it seemed bright enough.These were packaged well, felt strong enough but were a waste of my time."
2,The Solar Light Does Not Work and Does Not Hold Charge,I did not believe the earlier review of the solar light till I got a set myself. The rechargeable batteries did not hold the charge and also one of the light did not even work from the get go. It was a very nice solar light set only if it worked. Too bad but I had to request for refund.
3,Die,"These are not long-lasting. The plastic yellows with age in desert sun... they are good for about a year, then not really useful anymore.I'd recommend something made of glass."
3,just okay,"can't get all 4 of them to work at the same time, tried everything, this product I really could do without"
3,"Three out of Four are working, you get what you paid for.","I purchsed this set of light two weeks ago, and installed them in front of my house. After all the hard work of unpacking and installing, I noticed only three out of four worked, but it was too late to take them out and return. The design is good, so I will keep them, and live with 75% success rate."
2,Pretty but beware of batteries,"Ive owned solar lamps for years now. I saw these pretty amber lamps and ordered them for my birthday. The batteries they require are Ni Cd batteries (rechargeable), no other kind can be used, thats normal. Whats also normal is that 1 of 4 has now burned out within the first 2 mos. of usage. Went to Radio Shack to purchase new batteries, I was told they don't sell them anymore, THEY ARE BEING DISCONTINUED!!!!! I ordered replacements on-line from onlybatteries.com. All 4 new batteries are weak according to my battery tester and Im charging them now (1 for the 2nd time). Is it worth it? You decide."
4,Brinkman Dual Window Pane Solar Stake Light Set,"Great little solar light. I also ordered the Garden Prairie Solar State Light because I wanted the taller stake, but this model comes with the stakes and the prairie stakes so you can just order this model and not model 822-0578-4. They work great as long as you have them all placed in the sun so they can recharge each day. I have had to buy some rechargeable batteries and a charger for the lights that are under my tree's in my yard. Overall they accent my yard beautifully and I have enjoyed them very much. Very easy to put together as well."
2,Great but only 3 of the 4 are working,"Hi. We like these lights. They are pretty and look nice in the yard. However, right out of the box only 3 of the four work."
2,25% Failed,"I purchased 3 sets of these lights based on the positive comments on this site. Out of 12 lights, 3 do not work. That is a pretty high failure to recommend this product."
3,"Great looking lights for the Price, but only 3 of the 4 lights work!","They look great, but only three of our four lights worked. The three that do work, work great though, and last 4-6 hours."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"This is not even close to the best moments from Tits like CABEA DINOSSAURO and JESUS NO TEM DENTES NO PAÍS DOS BANGUELAS...But got some good songs like EU NO PRESTO, CUIDADO COM VOC, ISSO, MORTO DE FÉRIAS and NO FUJA DA DOR...."
3,phil721,"The old footage was nice to see. I think the ESPN sportscentury was a much better piece of work then this recap of ""Big Red"". It was worth the fifty bucks to see his individual races. If you don't care to see the races,wait and TIVO his sportscentury piece."
3,"Great Horse, High Price","If any of you are still in awe of Big Red, even after all these years, you will love this DVD. There isn't much new material here. Just about all of it has been broadcast many times on sport channel specials and the producers were unable to clean up the TV footage from 1972-73. The interviews are interesting, but don't provide any new information for fans; but having those interviews and footage all together is great.One thing: The Life & Times of Scretariat is overpriced at $40. $25 would have been reasonable. I suggest waiting until used copies are available."
2,Don't waste your money.,I would never have ordered this DVD at the excessive cost (over $[...] with shipping) if I had known that it was such an amateurish production. It's pathetic.
3,"Great DVD, But Not New As Advertised","The DVD itself is fantastic. However the seller advertised this DVD as ""new"", and the DVD arrived with no cellophane, and was obviously used. I would ask for a NEW replacement, but it's not worth the hassle of sending the DVD back."
2,Sent It Back,"My wife and I were thrilled to see this DVD being offered after seeing the movie. However, the DVD does not live up to the movie in so many ways. The footage itself is dated technology and, therefore, the clarity that one would hope for is not there. Also, while it may be fun for some to sit and watch the twenty-one races, after the first few it does get a little old. There simply isn't the drama in the race. I suppose it takes a true horse racing fan to appreciate the nuances of what is going on but the footage often didn't allow for any in depth analysis.When the video of the movie comes out, we will be one of the first to purchase it. What the movie confirms is that Big Red was truly one of a kind and so was his owner."
2,Disappointing.....,"I was eager to see this documentary about Secretariat and unfortunately, this DVD doesn't do justice to this great horse. The sound quality is very inconsistent, sometimes it's very loud and other times you can hardly hear the announcer. I was told that there would be subtitles on this film. It is hard to understand the jockey, trainer and groom and there are NO subtitles to help you figure out what they are mumbling. One bright spot is the owner's interview: You CAN understand her and also the narrator. The films of the races are of poor quality. You don't learn anything about Secretariat's life off of the race track. The PBS documentary, ""American Experience"" for Seabiscuit was much, much better than this effort for Secretariat. I wouldn't recommend spending $50 on this product."
2,*Cringe*,"I really wanted and expected to like this - I mean I love that it has the footage of all of Secretariat's races, but the documentary itself does him no justice. This is supposed to be honoring one of the greatest thoroughbreds of all time and the quality of the documentary is crappy - for a $50 DVD I expected a lot more. For Secretariat I expected a lot better. I couldn't stop cringing when they played that cheesy Bryan Adams song in the background to Secretariat's racing footage! Ugh.Poor Secretariat is probably rolling over in his grave!It's like they hired a cheap wedding videographer to put this together - Not worth $50 - Wait till they drop the price or something better comes along."
2,Not worth the money,"For $50 I was expecting a professionally produced product with extensive coverage of Secretariat's life. I appreciate the biographical information; I don't appreciate the cheesy song at the end. I especially don't appreciate the gaps in the playback - similar to the kinds of breaks in continuity you get on a scratched record. I wouldn't mind so much if it cost less. I get more comprehensive, more enjoyable coverage from the pieces on YouTube."
3,"Ordinary, unlike Secretariat!","After viewing this DVD I would have to say it was what I expected. I had read the reviews of this product that it was ordinary. Because of this I refused to pay the ridiculous price of 50 bucks. But I'm a big Secretariat fan, so when it dropped to 40 I decided to buy it for Christmas. It was as the reviews said, ordinary at best. I really believed they could have done a better job with the quality of film. By far the highlight of the DVD is his 20 of 21 races. His 2yo coverage was horrible, including no footage of the Laurel futurity. But this isn't their fault, if the footage doesn't exist, it doesn't exist. All the 3 year old races were good quality, they were the original video tape broadcasts, with the exception of the Preakness which was shown on film. If you are a Secretariat fan, I would recommend that you purchase this."
4,"Secretariat, Life & Times","Great history of Secretariat; however, this DVD is not worth $40. Certainly not enough info for that amount of money. I was sorry I paid that much money for it."
2,Secretariat Deserves Better,Very poor quality; blurry images. Don't buy.There must be another DVD honoring Big Red.
5,God Bless the Gargoyles,"A great book about people/things that are different and unwanted. Everyone can learn a lesson from this book about acceptance. It is a fantasy book of poetry, with excellent color illustration, and is recommended for the K through 12th grades, as well as teachers and parents."
5,Now more than ever...,"Today is the Friday following the tragic attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. For some reason, I went through my stacks of children's books this evening (I'm a teacher BTW), and I had to pull this one out. I've never been able to get through this story/poem without my voice cracking and tears in my eyes, but this evening - it was full scale balling! The words and images just seem to fit so well with the way we're all feeling.""God bless the hearts and the souls who are grievingfor those who have left, and for those who are leaving.God bless each perishing body and mind, God bless all creatures remaining behind.God bless the dreamer whose dreams have awoken.God bless the lovers whose hearts have been broken.""Buy this book and share it with those you love!!"
5,"Excellence, original, appropriate for all ages!","I got this book for my 27th birthday. I cried. My 15 month old neice sat in my lap for hours looking at the pictures. It has a powerful message, well stated in language that is easily accessible to all ages. You will get something new from this book every time you reread it. And the illustrations are gorgeous."
5,tower of power,"having owned many brands of loudspeakers over the years,this is my first pair of advents.and i could not be happier! a bargain at 200.00 apiece,a steal at anything less. crisp clean highs,nice tight bass.dual sets of gold plated 5-way binding posts.build quality is excellent.these speakers are tall so a little tipsy on thick pile carpet. grilles a little tough to remove but worth time. 5 -4 inch mid-woffers -1 inch dome.stellar looks and sound to match.owners manual is joke,very very vague.do not hesitate to pull the trigger and purchase these beautys."
5,Addicting Television Series,A very addicting television series. My girlfriend and I can't get enough of this show. Season One owns.
5,THE OC season 1,"I think this collection of DVDs is a must have for any OC fan or anyone interested in introducing themselves to the show. So much happens in the first season, it is like 2 seasons packed into one. The OC is a great blend of comedy and drama and each character is so complex that they never get boring. Season one features a variety of situations, relationships, and events that were unexpected, funny, and mind-boggling. I highly recommend this set of DVDs and to start at episode 1 and watch in order."
5,The Best Show on TV!,"The O.C. is my all-time favorite show. The drama that unfolds is incredible, and you quickly find yourself on the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next. Being a college student working part-time, money isn't something I have in abundance. But I made sure that both Season 1 and Season 2 of this remarkable show were in my budget. I LOVE THE O.C.!"
5,Excellent,"I am going to be honest:I have never watched an episode, though my wife and kids love it. In-fact while I am sending this review, they are watching the 1st season now. They have already watched the 2nd season and felt they needed the 1st so I got it for them right here on Amazon. Great Deal. I maybe missing something. Hmmm."
1,Please,"Like another ""hater"", as you put us, said ""If I could I would give this show negative stars."" That's how I feel about this show. The only reason it is where it is, is because nothing else is on on Thursday night, and because it's got pretty people. Pretty people who can't act might I add. I watched a couple episodes. And let me tell you, they were painful. Who is stupid enough to buy into this crap? Mischa barton is the worst. Her little ""acting"" is pathetic. My mute grandma could do better. The only reason this show is somewhat liked is because of looks. It sucks, and the more you engross yourself in this crap the more you wont be able to reconze true talent."
1,My confession,"I actually used to almost like this show when it was called ""Beverly Hills 90210"".Mischa Barton is cute though."
5,The OC is AWESOME!,"Even though I haven't bought the DVD yet, i know the oc is gnarly. I almost relate to the drama on the show in my own teenage way. lol. I am going to get this season set asap. The OC is so rad!!!!BUY THE OC"
1,stupid show,I don't know why people love to watch this crap. This show is like Beverly Hills 90210 back in the 90's. Rich kids who have so so many problems. Even a corrupt CEO or a gang member don't have as many problems.
5,brunette babe,"O---M---G Ryte when ur done reading this GO BUY THE O.C. SEASON 1!!! I'm a HUGE O.C. fan and this is a great buy for a teenager or even adult for that matter. I loved watching the Season on T.V. but now that its on DVD I watch it allllll the time. Its so0o nice to be able to watch it all the time. If you're not an O.C. fan YOU SHOULD BE!!! Watch The O.C. every week on Fox at 8:00pm. Well now you should know what to do, and if you don't GO BUY THE O.C. SEASON #1 NOW!!!!!!!!!<3brunette babe"
2,OC Season 1,"Well, this season was a season of mixed emotions. I laughed, I cried, but mostly I screamed and threw the TV at my cat. This show is my life. If that hot chick dies, I will cut off my thumb. That one time the guy said ""Welcome to the OC Bitch"" I was like ""whoa, thats good material."" This show satisfies me more then my wifes sister. Amen."
1,Amazon price... my dear God.,"This review is not for the show. It is for the price of this box.Last week it was $22.00, and now that I go to buy it's $32. How can the price of a box set GO UP? Ridiculous!!!I hate to give the product low stars for this, but it has to be brought to the attention of the buyers that the prices here jump all over the place. This is the third item from my wish list that has gone UP in price.The fact that they are raising prices is enough for me not to buy this product."
2,9021nO,"Recycled scripts, 2nd rate acting, even for TV standards, and misplaced SoCal values. It is suprising this even has a market, since the 3rd season is nosediving. I was forced to watch most of this, and was most concerned by the possibility of seeing thse 'stars' hence in other debacles."
3,Its guilty pleasure fun!,"I never watched this show when it was on, but when Benjamin MacKenzie came across the screen when I was watching a re-run, I knew I needed to keep watching. In. love. with. that. boy.Otherwise, I like the interplay between Marissa and Ryan and Summer and Seth. Their interactions are interesting and very witty sometimes. Peter Gallagher and Alan Dale are also very good on the show.I give it only three stars because I wish the show had more of the interactions between the four actors who are the leads and fewer shootings, fires, overdosing, etc. I understand it is supposed to be a soap opera, but I find myself looking forward to the interactions between Seth and Ryan, or Summer or Marissa more than another fight, shooting or something.Another positive for the show is the location. It looks like just about the most idyllic place on earth."
5,One The Best (Flippin' Good),"I never watched the OC when it aired on TV I thought it was another teen drama, my friend one day convinced me to watch a couple of episodes believe me when i say this I got Hooked, i just wanted to watch more, all the characters play their roles brilliantly, So I will recommend this to anyone, Season One & Season Two is Very very good"
4,I was waiting for this...,"After the ""death"" of such good shows as Friends, Ally McBeal, Sex & the City, Frasier, Dawson's Creek, ... it just seemed that television wasn't the same anymore. There truly was something missing, something to keep me from turning my tv off.At first, I must admit that i wasn't very interested in the OC. Yet, i really don't know why. Maybe was it because i didn't want to give it a chance. Maybe that i thought that nothing could replace my lost shows (i sound so melodramatic). Well, i was wrong. I learned to appreciate the OC week after week and i am now hooked. I bought this DVD set and i really enjoyed it. Marissa is soooooo gorgeous! Seth is soooooo cute in it's own way! Julie is soooooo manipulative! Ryan is sooooo... etc!Discover this if you haven't yet."
3,DVD Defect,"The O.C. is a wondeful show and this is a great set.Problem is there is a defect, at least in the first round of manufacturering, that causes 4 of the 7 included DVDs to become loose from their disk holders in the case and when you open the set for the first time they are scratched and not in their holders. I have seen this in a set from Amazon.com as well as 3 sets in a Best Buy. Also the Fox.com OC forums are reporting this wide spread problem.I for one am very concerned about paying $50 for a set that comes with damaged disks on Day 1 and I haven't seen ANY OC sets (and I have personally seen 4) that haven't had loose disks and damage.Be careful."
1,Lets watch the O.C. !!!!!!,"Its almost as good as Laguna Beach!!!!! ha ha HA! Why don't you people who LUV this show go get a wake up call soon?This is like 90210 all over again, I never thought It would happen but hell has frozen over to allow a crap show like this to rear its ugly head again. I watched one show, one freakin show and my eyes and ears were bleeding at the end with the horrible acting!You know what that show was? It was the one that had the seeak preview of the new star wars movie that comes on May 19th. Think of that people, the only reason the ratings went up was because the nerds like me were waiting to see Darth Vader again. Think about that the next time you are sacrificing animals to you O.C. gods!P.S. that chick from ET on MTV isn't even that hot."
5,The OC First Season,Was so happy to get such a GREAT deal on Amazon. My Daughter was so happy and watch the whole season on her Holiday break.
5,BEST SHOW EVER....BEST DVD EVER!,"""The OC"" was the best show ever on because it had al the elemts of a good show. It had action, love, comedy, drama... Everyone I knew was watching it. It was like EVERYONE wanted to be in ""their"" lives including me! So, buy the DVD Boxset! ""THE OC"" SEASON 2: NOVEBER 4th, 2004"
1,used!!,The First Season of the O.C. is great. I love it. But not the box it came in. It is used! It looks like some wild teenagers threw it around and watched it at least 3701203771209 times before they sold it as new. Not worth the money! The only reason i kept it is the dvds. If you want a nice box - buy it somewhere else!
3,it was in okay condition,"I was told it was going to be in good condition... or very good but at least for sure good condition. The outside box of the OC season 1 was scratched, and one of the cds totally look scratched -thankfully it played, so maybe that is why they called it good condition even though it didn't look like it. But it did work, I just wish they could put the quality of how it looks and how it plays for movies."
3,Highly addictive but nothing much happends,I got addicted to this show right away and could not stop watching. I liked the charactors and plots but after watching all season 1 you fell like nothing much happend. The storys are allt he same through season 1. Overall the shows enjoyable enough for some fun fluff on tv.
5,Why did they cancel such a good show??,"Even though I'm in my early 50's, I loved watching this show each week! I didn't discover the show from the first season, but quickly fell in love with it once I ""did"" start watching it! I own all Four Complete Seasons! The talent of Peter Gallagher, Kelly Rowan, Ben Mckenzie, Adam Brody, Melinda Clarke, Rachel Bilson, Autumn Reeser, Willa Holland, Alan Dale, Tate Donovan & Chris Carmack made the show so fantastic to watch! A MUST BUY SETS!"
4,Great Gift 4 O. C. Lovers,"If you love the series, you'll enjoy owning the first season. It is a great way to refer back, and to take a guess at what's next."
5,OC review,The O.C. has done well for itself. Although this DVD does not have any decent special features (there are a few bloopers etc.) the show more then makes up for it. All the episodes are included and its perfect for any teenager.
1,This show flat out sucks,"First of all how did Peter Gallagher ever become an actor? He has got to be the ugliest man I've ever saw on TV. He looks like a werewolf or something. God is that man ugly.OK well anyway this show is about some little bitch boy who thinks he tough, but he's really a punk little girly boy. He goes to Orange County to live with werewolf man. Well if this isn't the sappiest bunch of crap. First of all Mr. Tough Guy from the Hood can't act to save his life. All he can do is stand around and deliver dialogue like a bitch.Please, if you have any brain cells, stay the hell away from this show. It's just more Hoolywood fluff written by bozo writers with the worst cast since....hmm can't think of a comparison. This is the worst cast. Ever."
3,what is the correct aspect ratio????,"Amazon lists this DVD as widescreen 1.66:1 anamorphic. Everywhere else says this DVD is in 1.33 full screen. What gives?The show has always been in true widescreen 16x9 format, so it would be incredibly dissapointing if it IS in pan and scan, considering I've been watching this show since the beginning in widescreen format on digital television. Why would Warner Home Video make such a huge mistake? I thought studios had figured out by now not to make full screen DVDs anymore. Someone please shed some light, as I now have to cancel my order if it is full screen."
5,It's about time Amazon.com had this available for purchase!,This is one of the best shows out there today. Trust me its worth the 50 bucks. Any true OC fan should have this DVD. I can't wait to buy it.
5,I LOVE THE OC,the oc is so cool and interesting because the people are very cool and very awesome. The writers did a good job in writing the best show ever. and the actors were totally good at acting. and they should win an emmy. they are cool and the show is cool everyone from australia LOVES the oc so the dudes at channel 1O DONT MAKE THE SHOW GO AWAY!!!!1
3,Not as much as I expected,"This was an adequate exposition of the river ironclads with a good cutaway drawing. I had expected more technical details, especially on the armor disposition and the engines. Some detail on the living conditions and fighting experiences of the crew would also have been nice."
2,One LARGE error,"As well as this book may be written, there was one glaring error repeated throughout the book - that of referring to Vicksburg as Vicksburg, Tennessee. Apparently the editors and/or authors have zero familiarity with the War Between The States, because anyone who knows anything about the war knows that Vicksburg is in Mississippi. And this error was not just a one time error (as it occurred in the related work Mississippi River Gunboats of the American Civil war 1861-65) but appears repeatedly. It is truly astounding. Having said that, the book was well written and a great source of information. I would like to have given it 4 stars but the errors really detracted from an otherwise good work, making me doubt the integrity of the remaining information. Still a good volume to have in one's collection."
5,A Great camera!,Just got it last week and totally fell in love with it! The reviews helped out on my decision not to mention the price! Went to a local store and noticed they had the 3 series for the same price! Great deal.The only glitch was the eyepiece instructions. However just turn to page 117 in the manual to see how to slide the eyepiece up to attach the cover on the strap.Great camera and great service!
2,Information needed,I have bought a Minolta Maxxum 4 about an year back. It's a good camera. But unfortunately I have misplaced the product handbook of the same. I tried to search for the same in the website. Other than your site hardly I could find any other. But the manual is only 18 pages instead of 150 odd pages. Can you please help me?
4,Similac Advance,"I purchased Similac Advance for my sister. It was a great gift for a new mother because you tend to go through a can very quickly. However, the cost of shipping was hardly worth the purchase."
5,Head Liquidmetal Tennis racquet,"WOW... This racquet really improved my swing. Great product, for a great price!It is head heavy and it does the work... Also greatly improved my tennis elbow."
4,tennis,"received on time, the racquet takes some time to get used to, but I am 50+ and used to be a medium player, trying to get back into the sport."
3,Alright,"This movie is alright. It's great to watch only because it's from that era. If you're really looking for a good film, watch Style Wars. That is a classic and it goes into depth about graffiti, breaking and hip hop. The acting in this movie sucks, but it's kind of cool to see some of the renouned artists. Rent on Netflix and only buy if you like to collect stuff from this period."
3,Cudda been betta',"Still a great hip hop movie...but I would've liked to see what hit the cutting room floor...behind the scenes...more of the performances that were editted. The reunion was nice but even that was too short. Hey Mr. Ahearn, do the fans a favor and put out a DVD of JUST THE PERFORMANCES!!! That DVD would fly off of the shelves!"
1,Could do better for a 25th anniversary DVD!,"I rate this one star; not for the movie itself but purely for the actual DVD (packaging, presentation, etc).For a 25th anniversary edition release, it could be better. It's been packaged in nothing but a regular DVD case, not even a booklet inside which would have been nice, perhaps showing still images from the movie or photos of graffiti.The people behind releasing this DVD could have come better, aside from the additional features there's nothing about it that screams 'special edition'. Pretty disappointed. It doesn't do this movie the justice it deserves for it's 25th anniversary."
1,CD - I Love You Truly,"The quality of the tape was extremely bad. By the time you got to the song I Love You Truly, it was garbled with a lot of static. I bought two (2) tapes and they both were the same substandard quality. Very disappointed."
3,How do you play the video?,I can't get the video to show! Not on my computer or DVD! if you can let me know how please tell me.
2,Not quite up to scratch,"One of the things ""Custom"" meant was an exact fit for a particular seat (in this case.) These covers, while nicely finished, clearly are a generic type for different bucket seats. As such, they work OK. What doesn't work is the closure - hook & loop - at the top of the seat. Not nearly enough overlap of the Velcro fastenings - you will need to add separate pieces to both the seat top and the cover itself, for them to close properly. I expected a little better from Saddleman.I chose not to install the headrest covers as the opening through the headrest is lost."
3,OK,"The product came in a timely manner and was exactly what claimed to be, however, I was very disappointed that there was no scoop to measure the daily intake. All other kinds that I've ordered hsd a measuring scoop that goes in the bottle so I was bummed that this one did not."
2,Ew,"Granted this is the first time I've used a product like this, so I can't review it comparitively. But...ew. The mouthfeel is gross and so is the taste. Even my son who'll eat/drink anything vociferously rejected it."
5,Never felt better,"I started adding Greens+ to my morning shake and I have never felt better. You will feel the difference in your body with consistant use. More energy, greater memory, happier...the list goes on. I have never tried any other green supplement, and I don't feel the need to look any further everytime I glance over the ingredients on the bottle. I recommend it to everyone."
1,Yucky taste,"I went with this choice because it was half the price of ""Greens First"" which blows it away. You get what you pay for. Greens Plus tastes like Spirilina. I hope there is more than that in the ingredients. I was feeling good after drinking it so maybe it still has the benefits but yucky taste."
2,Yucky and overpriced!,"I like the ingredient content so I give it 2 stars. But the taste is horrible, it's slimy and it's too expensive. I get more for the money, the same if not better of an effect and MUCH better taste when I buy my usual stuff:Amazing Grass Green SuperFood, 60-Servings, 17-Ounce Tub(I bought it for way cheaper than today's listing, you have to watch prices!) I didn't like this Greens stuff at all and it literally gags me. I'll stick with Amazing Grass."
5,Greens+ One of the Originals and still the Best,"I've taken Greens+ on and off for nearly ten years now, and it is my favorite supplement by far. First of all, it's food rather than added vitamins. I actually like the way it tastes, especially in apple juice or orange juice. I find that it does give an energy boost. I take more in the winter, and although I can't prove it, I'm fairly certain that it boosts my immune system and is a good flu/cold preventer. I recommend Greens+ for days when you are eating too few fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, it's an outstanding energy supplement if you are eating well, and choose to fast or eat lightly for a day. The downside, is the price; but the price on Amazon is outstanding."
5,Very unusual taste.,"This needs to be taken with some type of juice. I am a nurse and this product taken with water is horrible. I have teken it with apple juice and it is tolerable. I am sure it works well and does what it needs to accomplish, however, it has an unbelievable taste. UGH!!!!!!!!!!"
3,greens supplements,"Here at Amazon is the only place I have found a decent price. Everywhere else this simply costs too much for what you get. It has a solid base of greens and then a lot of foo-foo that has little or no evidence of having value for your body.All greens supplements taste weird; you need to start off mixing it with other things in your shakes to alleviate the large green taste.I prefer ""Green Kamut"", to Greens+. It contains only barley and alfalfa, but I feel just as good or better using it than Greens+ and it is cheaper. Amazon sells ""Green Kamut"" as well."
1,Just so its clear,"Please note if you are considering buying that these are not the original movie soundtracks, these are an orchestra re-recording the music. If, like me, you like the original thing, then this is not for you."
1,THE MAGNIFICIENT WESTERNS,"Don't waste your money.This is NOT the original soundtrack music. The orchestrajust sounded like it was ""trying"" to imitate but couldn't.In fact, it sounds like some of the singers, were singingthe lyrics in BRITISH voices!! With British accents.Listening to that alone was like getting an ice water enema.Not at all enjoyable. I do not recommend this cd to anyone."
5,wonderful!,"These cd's were actually for my sister, but I have gotten to enjoy hearing them as well. They have an amazing selection, and have provided hours of enjoyment."
1,Re-recordings disappointing,"I've only listened to 1 song from this CD, so feel free to mark this review negatively. But the other ""one-star"" review here on Amazon should be heeded -- these are re-recordings. The song I listened to (on Pandora) is entitled ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and is based on tunes from that soundtrack. But the actual first half is from the piece ""As a Judgment"" and the second half is based on the film's overture. Both halves are re-done, and while not horrible, have lost a lot of power. The original As a Judgment, in particular, is a masterpiece so buy the original soundtrack! If you don't know these songs, you may be safe buying this CD because you won't be disappointed by the comparison. Still, I wonder how badly the other tunes have been mangled when re-recorded? I wouldn't take the risk of buying this CD unless I'd heard it entirely (not just Amazon samples)."
3,The Cow Goes: MOO,"This CD starts with a rooster bringing in a new day. This is soon followed by chickens who've just laid eggs and a lone cow (which turns to cows later). Then we hear various ""farm noises"" which if you've never worked a farm, they are just noises (for the most part). This CD didn't do it for me as since there were so many unidentifiable noises. But if you've worked a farm (a smaller farm might be best), you will appreciate this the most."
5,Just Right!,"Product arrived on time and the fit was exactly what my husband needed to help control the swelling. Because of the compression, they took some time to put on the first few times but it has gotten easier."
5,great fit,These give an excellent fit from foot to thigh when sized properly. They have silicone beads along the thigh cuff to hold them firmly in place. I have short legs for a guy so they come all the way to my upper thigh.
4,"too tight at thigh, too short for femur","Granted, I'm a lady with long femurs & these are for men, but no one is making these for the 6' crowd. Better than nothing, however."
1,Maybe Times Have Changed?,"On page 56, the author writes, ""If a sale looks good, go at the crack of dawn and knock on the door. Also, unlike the professionals, who seldom buy such stories, you can sometimes call a private or go to the house a day early on some pretense (a trip out of town, a doctor's appointment, or some such and get in before the crowd.""This is unethical and dishonest, and pretty much negates anything else the author has to say in the book. In my area -- if not most of the USA? -- anyone approaching a house door at the ""crack of dawn"" will be run off like a stray street dog! ""No early birds"" is a very common classified ad pronouncement.This kind of ""advice"" from a ""dealer"" also gives the whole business a bad name."
2,Not engaging at all,"I bought this for a 4th grader in advanced math. To be frank, the software is boring. You can be lectured to in one program or take quizzes in another. There's no interactivity - kids will become tired of this software quickly. The publishers quality control is lax too - one screen showing topics to be quizzed on listed ""Additionition"" among its offerings.The grade range says grades 4-12 but it has concepts (like addition) suitable for lower grades. Kids in those lower grades will find the software even more boring.I had no trouble installing the software and running it under Vista, though it takes a really long time to install and uninstall. I'm returning this software - don't make the same mistake I did and skip this product (I bought it in a store on impulse...no reviews to guide me.)"
1,DIDN'T WORK,"Waste of money. I bought it for my daughter, loaded it on her XP machine and it just locked up. I contacted Topics and they have a downloadable fix... but of course that only works if you got it to load right in the first place. Infuriating that software vendors can get away with this and I have to waste my precious time getting their products to work, and when I seek a refund they tell me I'm out of warranty. Finally you just throw in the towel and kiss your money goodbye. Isn't that called fraud? I will never buy a Topics product again. This event (along with many others like it) convinced me to migrate my family over to the Mac platform, where programs actually work!"
3,They Still,"Get warped =/. If you need a cheap alternative just get this, but I would go the extra range and get something good."
4,Good multifunctional case,"Good protective case, can fit up to 10 alto or tenor reeds in slots that are numbered for easy organization. Highly recommend for players that switch between horns."
4,Typical Lizzie,"If you watch the show, you'll see that this book comes straight from the series. Nothing new here.Its a quick and easy read for an adult (I did it in one hour). Its a clean, fun book for kids. I would say the development level for this is about a 3rd grade reading level although 4th and 5th graders would enjoy it, too."
3,lizzie mcguire book #2 tottaly crushed,lizzie finds out that larry tudgeman has a crush on her and when kate finds out and tells the hwole school will lizzie dis larry or get back at kate and plus later in a socail studies project lizzie gets paired up with kate and they bring up old memories will lizzie and kate be friends again or will they still be sworn enimies for life dont miss this book
4,Clean Vegan Eating,"A great book for Christian (or non) who seek a more spiritual and religious approach to healthy eating. Most recipes are easy to make, however some ingredients could be hard to find in rural markets."
3,"So Much Promise, So Little Satisfaction",This is a cook book which at first glance seems to offer so much promise but is full of frustrations when you actually try to prepare the recipes. Many dishes take too much time to complete and require extensive equipment as well as unfamiliar ingredients. The book's instructions are inadequate for the inexperienced cook.
3,Great book - Almost,I am not an accomplished food preparer thus I want and need all the help I can get from a recipie or recipie book. It is maddening that some of the recipies in the book (indicate only) that it is for one serving and some ( indicate only ) it will be for multiple servings but majority do not even indicate what it will serve. This is a major issue with me but probably not with practiced food preparers. Otherwise the book and principles it serves are excellent.
2,Definetly not Raw,Some of the recipes are good and some not so good as per typical cookbook. This definetly shouldn't be listed as RAW because it's not. They use flour in many recipes.
3,Not enough lush strings - too much choir,I was a bit disappointed in this album. I was expecting LUSH and lovely arrangements and not the traditional church choir/organ sound.I hope the other 101 Strings songs of faith album is better.
4,Brokeback Crackajack,"""Brokeback Mountain"" meets the U.S. Army and Tinseltown in this romantic novel set in 1960-61. While serving Uncle Sam, Alex Price falls in love twice, first with a fellow solider, then with the daughter of a TV star, all the while dreaming of being Hollywood's next leading man. His qualifications: he's a south Georgia farmboy with aspirations, exactly what Hollywood usually isn't looking for. Bill Jackson's debut novel crafts a fast-reading page-turner as Alex pursues his dream while stumbling through his love life. Mr. Jackson shows his flair for irony by interjecting ""Cracker Jack"" (as opposed to the title spelling) into the book's most moving scene."
3,a beautiful old story,"the movie was released in 1971, not 1905 as Amazon indicated. it's a love story with a happy ending. the story line is nothing news: a girl born out of wedlock was abandoned by her rich family and brough up by a poor gypsy woman. later she not only found her prince charming, but also reunited with her birth mother and the rest of her family. The 2 leading actresses, costumes & themes were all so beautiful. it's quite entertaining."
2,"Yesenia (Jacqueline Andere, Jorge Lavat, Irma Lozano) English...",great filme saw it many years ago in my country its amazing I found it in amazon great buy and good old time entretainement.recomend this movie
5,thankyou,this movie is great i am enjoing with my family and friends thankyou very much for this great and fast service
5,Beautiful Necklace,Comes in a cute black gift box with a bow. Also included was a tulle pouch to store the necklace in if desired. Perfect gift item!
3,Good package and a good replacement of the original stylus,"The metal shaft of the stylus adds to the weight which feels good in your fingers. The original plastic stylus was too light and felt bad.This really is a good pair of stylii for the zaurus - fits perfectly too in the 5000D and the C750 models, both of which I have.Go for it - if you want a perfectly fitiing stylus without thoughts of 'will-it-fit-will-it-not-fit'."
2,"Nice feel, but short life",Looks and feels nice. But when dropped on concrete or ceramic floors ir will snap. Both broke the same way within a few weeks. I'm looking for the original all-plastic stylus.
1,Stay away!!!,I purchased one of their bathroom faucet sets less than a year ago. One of the copper fitting burst about a week ago. Their customer service is crap and they expect you to pay shipping/handling for replacement parts for their faulty products. After this the parts will not even reach you for 7-10 days. I'd advise anyone to get a Moen/Peerless/Delta they at least back up their warranty.
5,MSD stiil great stuff,"MSD still makes a great prodoct, unlike alot of manufactures that cut quality along with cost.NOT MSD SAME OLD GOOD STUFF"
2,"Stepmotherhood: How to Survive Without Feeling Frustrated, L","My live-in boyfriend's son was coming to stay with us for the summer so I ordered this book to help me prepare for his arrival. Bad idea!!! after reading this book I was so scared. This book has a very pessimistic view of how things will be. It goes over all the fears you may already have and makes you feel a lot worse. Luckily I have a very understanding man who helped me prepare myself and made it a smooth transition for all of us. I know there are many negative aspects with step families, but this book tells you all the bad and doesn't focus on the good, let alone help you deal with the problems. For your own sanity,...read with caution!!"
4,Honest,"Yes, this book may come across as negative, but it is realistic. Being a stepmom is tough and tougher still when you go into it with rose colored glasses and the belief that it will all be wonderful. It isn't. Cherie is honest in her assessment of the stepmom experience for most women who find themselves inheriting children who view them as the sole reason their parents aren't getting back together-- Even when their mother has been remarried for years and their parents were never happy. This book helped me focus on the positives of my life as a stepmom by working through the negative. While there were things I could not relate to (my skids were teens when I became their father's wife), the advice is clear, realistic and above all else honest."
5,This book has helped me!,There are step-mothers in here just like every stp-mother. Each one of these women who are mentioned in this book remind me of myself plenty of times. This book shows you that you are not alone and its ok to have certain kind of feelings. It also shows us were we went wrong.
2,Not what I expected,"My husband lovingly selected this book for me as I started on my Stepmother-hood journey with him last year. The How to Survive teaser on the cover would lead one to expect some practical advice. Unfortnately all it offered me was many varied examples of other people's situation without any direction on how 'not to let this happen to you'.I found myself disappointed at not being able to relate to the examples set fourth, and was further confused at the general message (or advice) for each chapter.I was finally able to use my yellow highlighter at the last few pages when she discussed how a stepmother may make specific contributions simply by her presence. (""a career woman may offer a useful contrast to the nonworking mother, an artist can open up a new world for a child"" etc.)"
2,Lifestyle no longer applies to most families in this generation.,"This book was written more than 20 years ago when blended families were not so ""normal"" and it wasn't ""normal"" for both parents to share placement of children. Therefor, this book did not pertain to the way my blended family/step relationships work. This book would be for the step mothering of a family where the father rarely sees his children."
2,Somewhat helpful,"This book discusses a lot of the situations stepmothers face, but I felt it had a negative attitude about stepfamily relations. It addressed some of the emotions of being a stepmother, but it doesn't really give a positive outlook on how to improve situations. Other books have left me with a positive attitude about being a stepmom and emphasizing the importance of a sense of humor, but this book made me feel as if things will never improve...so why even try. It may be helpful for stepmothers with problem stepchildren such as behavior or criminal issues."
3,Other people feel the same way,"This book is good for an individual looking for someone to identify with how they are feeling. The author gives anecdotes that relate to real life situations that any step-family may experience. The book, however, does not give the advice that I expected it to. Mostly, it told the reader of experiences they might have in a step-relationship. It did not give the reader in depth advice on how to deal with those experiences."
1,Not the best for stepmoms,"After reading several books on the topic of stepmothering, I have to rate this one as one of the worst. It highlighted all of the negative and did not discuss the positives of stepmothering. We all know stepmothering has ups and downs, but this book mostly discussed the downs. The book seems full of negative, bitter vibes. The topics do not include the attachment bonds that can be formed between child and stepmom; the author advises stepmoms to keep a distance and not get involved. I do not feel like this advice applies to me because I am a full-time custodial stepmom. I am totally involved in my stepchild's life and see more good than bad in the situation. I would not recommend this book to other stepmoms unless they are looking for bitter and vindictive literature."
1,Garbage !,"I rate this 1 star and call it garbage not because of the racy subject matter (that COULD have been interesting), but because the film is unwatchable.It looks like somebody took screen captures from a webcam to make the film.. fuzzy, jerky motion that is annoying to try and watch.Almost like the movie is skipping every 3rd frame or running on an altered framerate or something.The girl is sexy (in a skanky way)... but NO WAY would she mess around with the greaseballs cast in this film.15 minutes of trying to watch and then EJECT !!Video quality worse than a home movie."
2,ok,"I got to see this movie and I think that the quality of the film is not the best, including picture and sound. The drama itself I think is good, but if you are a person that likes to enjoy a movie in all the sentence, including sound and everything, then you may not be a fan of this movie.*Sponsored Post"
5,My gradsons Babie,I was so excited to find this monkey. My Grandson has had one all tree years of his life. Seems they are getting harder to find but again I was so excited to get the oppotunity for this one!
4,Country morning gas burner covers,They are beautiful and match the decor of my new kitchen. I myself just don't find myself putting them back on everyday. The product is wonderful.
4,The book is excellent,"The book is well organized. Writing style is reader friendly.I bought the book because I wanted more information about Warrior, Players will learn everything they need to play this challenging and dynamic character class."
3,Mainly an episode guide,"Like so many books about old TV shows that come out today, this one features some extensive bios on the actors (though all the info seems to come from one LOOK magazine article) and a very extensive episode guide.This isn't the book if you want in-depth chronicles of the production, but if you want to know about the actors, or maybe just locate info on the rerun you just saw, this is it."
5,"Everything I needed to know, and more...","I had great fun with this book. Being a beginner with pate de verre, it has had to take the place of classes, as there are none dealing specfically with pate de verre available where I live. I loved the relaxed and humorous style - it's always fun to learn with laughter. I found all the info I needed to get started and have successfully cast my first small pieces. The fact that it's not a 'pretty' coffee-table book actually made it very accessible to me and, personally, I like to be given the knowledge and then to create my own projects. Project books with step-by-step instructions have never really been my favourite. I can highly recommend this book to anyone interested in creating with glass."
2,Get what you pay for,"I actually like the material and cut of the shirt. However, I have had it for 2 weeks and have had 4 buttons fall off each of the two shirts I purchased. While its not a big deal to sew them back on, it is very annoying. I would recommend this with the caveat of add tacking to the buttons before wearing."
3,good shirt,"comfortable and quality but needs a little ironing around the buttons to prevent fabric from rolling. Or, wear it open as I do even though my wife isn't found of the style"
3,"Very comfortable, but after almost 3 months, it still smells like paint","Very comfortable, but like other reviewers mentioned, it smells a lot. It's been about 3 months now, and it still makes your sheets/pillows/etc smell strongly of paint. Not pleasant. I even removed the cover so it could air out more effectively."
4,"Listen, I'm not under 13, just didn't want to open an Amazon account.","Well, I apologise for this saying under 13, but I didn't want to register. Sorry to Amazon and others.Well, first off, This was my very first MP3 player. I was rather pleases all-in-all. The main problem with it is that it uses AAA batteries, and it can get costly after a while, so I'd suggest recharagbles. If it's safe to use them with this product, of course. The interface was very simple and I was quite pleased with the sound quality. I'm actually in the market currently for an MP3 player - But that's just because this is too small to fit my needs.Another complaint besides batteries, is that if you want it nice and neat, you have to do it your self. I spent about an hour organising the music into the proper genre and proper album. But once I did, I was quite pleased at how smoothly everything else worked.Well, though this is a rather short review, I really suggest this product. It worked great for me."
1,No more Creative products for me!,"I bought my wife a Creative Zen Nano Plus 1g MP3 so she could down-load from books on cd. It died early, but not early enough to be within warranty. Like a fool, I bought another Creative MP3, but this time a 2g MUVO V100. It died in less than five months, and again, after warranty. They will analyze the problem for $35.00, and I pay shipping (probably both ways) and I pay for parts, if needed. Do a Google search for Creative MP3 and you will see what they are all about."
3,"graet product, poor volumen","that's a great product, but the volumen level is poor, and it's an battery eater, so, you have to buy a Ni batterys."
2,Performance is good but lacks accesories,"I purchased the Creative nano 1GB at Christmas and was impressed with performance and accesories that were included for the price. I then purchased the muvo v100 which is almost identical to the nano but a little larger and has a direct USB plug-in. For essentially the same price, I did not get any accesories(a armband,skin, or belt clip) I had to purchase an armband from Creative for about what the player cost, because was not availiable anywhere else. Creative also charged my card wrong for the armband. So use caution when dealing with this"
2,It's OK...,"I own this item, and it's ok if you feel like flipping through songs in order to find the one that you are looking for. I, personally, would like something with a screen."
1,"Inexcusable ""documenation""","If you think you will learn anything about how to use this product by reading the documentation, forget it. It is useless. The product supposedly has a microphone and can be used a digital recorder. There is no mention of this capability in the manual. The item was returned."
1,Kindle Edition does not include forward by John O'Donohue,"This is no a review of the book itself, but of the Kindle Edition. I was disappointed to find that the forward by John O'Donohue was not included."
5,The Real Saint Patrick,"St Patrick has been given a bad deal...on one hand he is one of the most popular saints in the history of the Catholic church but sadly he is surrounded with mostly myths and legends. No snakes were driven out of Ireland but a more important demon was: paganism. This small book contains the only two documents left composed by Patrick ,a semi-biographical account of his life and works and a letter he wrote to other bishops condemning the enslaving of the Irish at the hands of the pagans.One would be surprised to find that St Patrick,the great missionary and supporter of the trinity was British,a former slave, relatively uneducated,basically a agnostic up until his capture at 16 and surrounded by so much controversy over his past life that he was seriously under threat of being removed from his post by the Church.A great read and invaluable to understanding the real saint Patrick and early Christian Ireland."
1,"Do not buy this ""book"". It is a publishing scam","This Nabu, or should I say Bibliobazaar, reprint is just a very bad quality, unacceptable print of the version that's been made available for free by Google Books.[...]Most of the pages that were scanned originally in gray levels, have been dropped to black and white savagely, making these pages unreadable. On the other hand, a lot of the plates are simply blank and missing.This reproduction in fact could be seen as illegal. If it is not, it is shameless and plainly hideous.As Google states, our mission is to organize the world's information and to make it universally accessible and useful. This is clearly not a useful way to serve public domain.Avoid this cheap fake book and treat yourself to a real book.I hope that Amazon.com shall simply stop making it available."
2,Painless wiring?,I'm not convinced that it was entirely painless to install. I would have been better off to have simply tapped into my battery :(
4,A dark tale,"Set in Switzerland in the 50's, The Pledge is a timeless book that shows a policeman's obsession with fulfilling his ""pledge"" to find the murderer of a child. This man gives up everything in this obsession, against the consensus who have fingered somebody else. The characters and the setting have a chilly darkness to them. The sky always seems overcast, and little light shines through the characters too. It's a short book, and difficult to put down. It isn't the happiest of books, the characters aren't fully developed, yet the cynical nature of life is fleshed out completely. It is timeless in that regard, one man standing on his own against a disbelieving group of his peers."
2,Unformatted,"Like Santayana's INTERPRETATIONS OF POETRY AND RELIGION, this book has been digitized from a library copy, with no attempt to format for easy Kindle reading. If you don't mind an aesthetically damned series of pages, go ahead and buy. But wouldn't it be nice if the purveyors of this important book CARED about what they're doing?"
3,good,"tv quality is good, although i've seen much better.the amplified sound is very strong for such a small tv toothe adjustable wall mount is extremely tricky when you are trying to swivel (left and right) and at the same time tilt (up or down).i bought it mainly for it's gimmick appeal (the ball shape and texture) for my son's bedroom. so for that reason it was worth the price."
3,Mobius Band - City vs. Country,"The Mobius Band seem quite comfortable stradding the indie rock and electronic worlds. Thus, on their CITY VS COUNTRY EP, they're free to wander in from their guitar-based session into the programming room and plug in the drum machines. With the strumming in synch with the beats on ""Starts Off with a Bang,"" it's more of a pop than a bang. The near IDM strains of the title track fall under sway of the guitar lines and actual drumming so that the intro is almost forgotten. But the sadness of ""I Had a Very Good Year"" is almost haunting in its simplicity."
4,Short and Sweet,I have had this album for a while now and in no way has it lost its charm. Multiply is one of the top songs played on my itunes list.
5,Official Mastering Mentalism Trailer,"Length:: 3:18 MinsThe official Mastering Mentalism trailer, from DoSomeMagic.com"
2,Fiction in the guise of non-fiction,"Clear from the details that the author has had only superficial exposure to Japan and finance. While purporting to be ""the true story"", this is clearly a sensational presentation of an amalgamation of exaggerated stories that have made their way around the Toyko market. Good escapist fiction to blow away an afternoon, but not to be confused with reality."
2,2 Stars if you are in the Industry 4 if you are not,"I had to read this book, because I know Dean Carney and Bill Sammon from real life. Unlike Michael Lewis of Liar's Poker, Ben simply doesn't understand the business. Simple things like scalping the Nikkei (index arb), index additions, are very mundane and simply strategies. Ben attempts to make John and Dean more than they are to sensationalize the characters, and in the process losses all street (wall street that is) credibility.But if you are in the index arb community, or are part of the princeton wrestling/football crowd, or was an expat in Japan. I recommend it. Otherwise, it's a decent piece of ficition.As a side note. The real Dean Carney is a great guy, and actually lives in upstate NY now with his beautiful wife and kids. The real retirement place is not Bermuda! How can one do index arb in Asian markets while based in Bermuda. Just say Hawaii, you are not going to give anything away."
5,The 5 hour book...,"I purchased ""Ugly Americans"" on my way to New York from Los Angeles and was finished by the time we landed. The book keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It is a fast paced story about hedge fund traders and their activities in the Asian markets.Unfortunately, the book is not very technical and, therefore, written for the average reader. If you a financially savy individual the book may be too rudimentary from a financial perspective. Regardelss it is a very entertaining book.Sven Klein, Santa Barbara, CA"
4,Good read; could have used more technical details,"Although Mezrich embellishes the characters enough to make an exciting semi-fiction story, I was very interested when the actual topics of hedge funds and arbitrage were breached. Yet, Mezrich seemed to make little effort to explain these in anything more than basic terms. Considering that the book is based on the exploits of high finance, I wish there was more in-depth analysis. Still, it is an intriguing book and a fast-paced read."
3,"Interesting, but hard to follow at times",I enjoyed Bringing Down The House much more. This was difficult to follow without some background information about the stock market.
4,Enjoyable Book,"Ben Mezrich, author of ""Bringing Down the House"" (the movie is called '21') writes a very enjoyable book about young Ivy League graduates with little finance experience who manipulated the Asian financial markets to make a fortune."
1,Ugly,"This book is all about one big speculation revealed at the end: 'putting one billion dollars into the tech stocks, while shorting one billion dollars of Nikkei futures at the same time.'The rest is Ferraris, Rolls Royces, Bermuda, etcetera, combined with too well-known stories (Barings, Nick Leeson and the Osaka earthquake) and Victorian descriptions of the Japanese sex industry.Nick Leeson told his own story far better in 'Rogue Trader'.For a deeper insight into the Japanese 'water trade', you should read the works of Nicholas Bornoff, Ian Buruma or Lisa Louis, as well as Tomoko Yamazaki's deeply moving 'Sandakan Brothel No 8' about child prostitution.Don't loose your time with these boring and totally unimportrant scribbles."
3,"A story of the people, not of the business","This book is clearly written to entertain rather than inform, as it orders the exposition of events to maximize suspense rather than efficiency of information presentation. Additionally, it is a very shallow read, revealing absolutely nothing about the mechanics of trading or the business operations of the financial world, focusing instead on the lavish and crazy lifestyles of the rich and tasteless who run this world. For example, the author constantly refers to Nikkei trades done by the people in this book but never explains what it is about the trades that these men made that makes them so special. As an entertaining read, this book gets 3 stars, but as an exposition on hedge funds or stock trading this book gets 0 stars."
3,"Good, if you aren't expecting much.","I listened to this book on a recent 12 hour road trip. It was a nice glimpse into a world foreign to me, but I didn't like that Mezrich wrote himself into the book. Further, I thought there could have been more meat to the book. I am sure there was more material than what is shared by Mezrich. This book is part Liar's Poker and part Bringing Down the House; the main characters basically treat the Asian Financial Markets like their casino. It is a good listen, if you can get past Mezrich's writing himself into the book (really annoyed me), and the fact that the characters he paints seem to be one-dimensional."
2,The Ugly Truth,"A disappointing follow up to ""Bringing Down The House"". Anticlimactic ending, but I suppose you cant blame the author for the ending to a true story. You can however blame him for thinking the story was worth writing in the first place."
4,A Great Read,"Just finished this book and found it very entertaining. It is definitely not a book on how to trade. It is a very interesting story that I suspect is somewhat dramatized. Reads like a novel.I wouldn't worry about suspected minor innaccuracies. Maybe most people can't rent a car in Bermuda, but if you have $50 million I'll bet there is a way around it. As far as Ivy league schools not giving athletic scholarships that is not exactly true. It is a matter of semantics. Most people familiar with education in the Northeast understand that prep schools and Ivy league universities don't give ""athletic"" scholarships, but they do give ""financial aid"" that just happens to fall substantially upon good athletes even if their families are well off."
4,Ugly Americans aptly titled,"This book is like Ben's others, a good read that keeps you wanting more. It is clear that the author enjoys digging deep into what these intelligent, elite Ivy Leaguers do with their connections and smarts. The book follows a Princeton grad on his deep dive into the Asian world and shows how the natives view the over-bearing visitors and how the visitors could care less about how they are perceived.Expensive motorcycles, ubiquitous sex, high dollar deals and a daily dose of living on the brink of the next big deal, keep you interested and amazed at what these young hot shots are exposed to and how they handle it."
4,Fun and entertaining,"This book is not going to teach you about financial instruments or how to manipulate markets. Instead, it's a fun read, and very hard to put down once you start. If you have ever been to Japan, you will find it fascinating for the parts of the country you suspected existed but probably never experienced (for better or worse). It's as much fun as ""Bringing Down the House."" If you have a penchant for a book to devour over a day or two, and you liked BDTH, I'd recommend it highly."
3,Entertaining yet disappointing,"I caught an interview w/ Mezrich on the radio in which he was discussing his two MIT/Vegas related books. He made it sound like those books went into a decent amount of detail as to the mechanics of what those people were doing to make their money. When looking up those books, I came across Ugly Americans. Based on the subtitle, and the author's summation of his other books, I expected a decent amount of insight into the financial instruments and the methods these ""cowboys"" were employing to make their money.I was wrong. The book reads like a work of fiction, and it seemed any info related to how the trading practices worked was out of obligation only, which left me feeling a bit let down. The focus of the book is clearly on the ex-pat lifestyle and Asian water trade culture. This made for an entertaining, easy read that would translate well to a movie, but it's not the behind-the-scenes look at how the Americans took advantage of the system that it promises to be."
2,Thin story,"While there are some amusing, interesting parts I was disappointed about the lack of details. The book is written for a non finance audience. There is nothing wrong with that, the title just promises more than what's really in there."
1,Real Fiction,"This book is amazingly stupid. As an expat who actually trades the Asian markets for a living, I can tell you first hand that this book is complete fiction. There's nothing of any substance regarding the financial world. The little that he does talk about markets and traders, he manages to both oversimplify and get it wrong. In order to make-up for the lack of real information, Mr. Mezrich spends roughly half the book describing every minutia of every scene. The dust cover talks a bit about Mr. Mezrich transforming himself from a suspense writer to a non-fiction journalist. This book is certainly not journalism. At best, ""Ugly Americans"" is a third rate novel."
3,Disappointed with the content,"I bought this book hoping to find a detailed story of how these graduates made millions in the overseas market. At best the author just skimmed the surface of the actual tactics used by the traders, and instead focused on the Japanese sex trade as the highlight of the book. While this book may make a excellent script for a hollywood blockbuster, its value as an in-depth analysis of trading is poor."
4,a real page turner,I found this book so riveting that I often read it for hours at a time and hsrd a difficult time putting it down.
2,"cheap knock-off of movie ""Boiler Room""","The author is no F. Scott Fitzgerald, and this book will never be considered for the Pulizer, or any other major literary award. This is one case where the movie was better than the book. The movie ""Boiler Room"" may have been plagiarized in this novel; simply change the names from New York and Long Island to Tokyo and Kobe and you have most of the same story: some people involved with finance are corrupt. You're probably better off buying the book, ""When Genius Failed : The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management"" by ROGER LOWENSTEIN."
1,Propaganda book written by a bitter dummy.,Propaganda I could have read in a cheap newspaper rag. Nothing but lame writing. The Rag in a cheap store would be a better purchase.
4,Reads like a novel-,Probably not 100% accurate but this is one of those books that reads like a novel. It starts out slow but the ending is powerful.
4,Entertaining account of the life of a professional trader,"The best way to describe this book is a work of fiction that is loosely correlated to real life events. The book is lacking in technical details and is not recommended as a handbook for how to arbitrage Nikkei futures. Of the several hundred pages in the text, only a small handful are dedicated to the mechanics of arbitrage and trading. The description of trading is very generic and does not provide any insights to anyone with even a passing knowledge of finance.Nonetheless, like his last book, this one was entertaining. He could have fleshed out his main characters with a little more relish, so that the reader could feel more empathy with their stories. Overall, an entertaining narrative if approached as such. If you are hoping to learn the intricacies of trading, then expect to be disappointed."
1,True story? BS!,"i heard from industry people that actually knew the person mentioned here, so the person does indeed exist, but the story isnt true. Lots of BS and conspirary that the author just puts in to entertain the reader..."
5,LIved in Japan and this book is a good first step,"I agree some of the details are faulty and things of this sort, but for a entertainment read this book is very good. I also think if you had no influence from Asia this book might be a eye opener and help you get interested in the region."
1,Barely entertaining and a poor description of hedge funds,A very low quality book on hedge funds. The author is more interested to discuss the sex scene in Asia than to go over the activities of hedge fund managers. The whole narative is very poor and revolves around a proprietary trader running aroung strip bars and riding his motorbike around Osaka and Tokyo.
1,Hedge Fund Fairy Tale: Ugly Duckling or Cinderella,"This piece of bush league fluff can't be compared with ""Liar Poker"". It reads like a fairy tale, maybe Cinderella or the Ugly Duckling, about a guy who is just a saint amongst all the money and sin that surrounds him, and ends up marrying the beautiful Jananese princess and living happily ever after. Hogwash and I don't believe it for a minute.I bought the book to learn about some raiders and all you get is some superficial gloss on trading index futures. I wanted to know about the Wild East and some good old fashioned American cowboys and Mezrich serves up this faux character that is too good for a Japanee whorehouse. What a crock. You won't learn about the ""sex and drug fueled edge"" becase the main characters don't partake!!!!Forget this book and wait until someone comes along and writes a book about Dean Carney. That would be interesting."
2,Disappointing,"Having lived and worked across Asia within multiple industries (including finance), I eagerly awaited this read. Unfortunately, I found the same old clichés on Japan and Capital markets. It takes years to really understand the region so fault to the author, but for something less glammed up and exoticised, (yet also based on a true story), I might suggest Clissold's, ""Mr. China."" Better yet, spend some serious time in Asia. It will pay off for you in the next century."
2,might have made a decent magazine article,"...but there really wasn't enough material here for a book.""Mission Impossible, The Heart of Darkness on speed"" is what we're promised in chapter two.But the core of the story is index-based arbitrage at a computer screen, and to keep that from being as boring as it sounds, Mezrich has to keep throwing distractions at us.Also, amid the flurry of phony names, phony jobtitle, phony descriptive details, it isn't clear what, if anything, we are supposed to take this book as documenting. The Leeson crisis as seen by the peripherally involved?"
2,Not even that interesting,"I really enjoyed the author's other two works, which I read quite quickly. Whether they were totally factual or not was immaterial...they were fun and interesting reads. This book disappoints. I didn't find the story interesting or fast moving. The ""danger"" element seemed forced, almost as if it was added in to ""spice things up"".If you're looking for a fast reading ""true"" story of big money makers, try Mezrich's other books. Avoid this one, whether you're a Mezrich fan or not."
5,Great guide to the actual laws that govern the field of ART.,"Unfortunately the field of art is one of the least codified subjects on planet Earth, which then invites many ""experts"" who are more than willing to tell the artist what is wrong with his artistic products. L. Ron Hubbard actually figured out what art is, what the laws and rules of true art are, and has given them in this book. Great reading for anyone interested in any of the artistic fields"
5,Stevie + Marvin + Smokey---sung by Michael McDonald,"In 2003, blue eyed soul singer Michael McDonald released his first Motown concept album. ""Motown Two"" is in some ways better than the first. The arrangements are faithful and respectful of the originals. I admit to wishing he'd have a 'Tammy Terrell' type vocalist on ""You're all I need to get by"" but for the most part, the McDonald covers are great. ""Motown Two"" is a great addition to your collection if you're a fan of either Motown or McDonald."
2,"Singer Great, Production Sucks","Dont get me wrong. I LOVE Michael Mcdonald. He has an amazing voice. But unfortunately, his voice is the only good thing about this album.Whoever produced this record should be not ever allowed in a recording studio again. Ever. He took a great singer and fantastic songs and saddled them with the ""whitest"" most ""elevator music"" production ever heard in years. Every attempt at ""hip"" tracks sounds like something done in the 80's. The background vocals are a farce. Each song without fail is ruined by the production.Some smart record exec should take Mcdonals vocals and remix them with a new producer into tracks worthy of his voice. Until that happens, until they release a remix album, dont waste your hard earned money on this.Just my 2 cents."
3,what's going on?,Steve Gee is right on. The three stars is for McD's vocal performance. Everything else is crap. Doing a Motown cover cd requires two key ingredients bottom(bass) and rhythm and this cd lacks both. Everything about this is cheesy to the extreme. Why didn't the producers get the remaining living Funk Brothers to be the band on this? THAT would have been awesome. Third time's a charm?
2,He ain't no Levi Stubbs,"I always enjoyed listenting to Michael McDonald when he was with the Doobies but lost track of him over the years. When I saw this Motown 2 CD and the glowing reviews, I thought I'd give it a whirl. Upon first listening I was really disappointed. I've given it another few shots and my verdict is finally a big, bored shrug. The arrangements are kind of bland - which is really a shame because the original tunes rocked their asses off. Finally there's Michael. He's got lovely pipes and a really smooth tone but no guts. I listened to the original Four Tops ""I'll Be There"" last night and Levi Stubbs is strong. That's what singing Motown's about. Michael's a crooner. He ougthta cut an album like Rod Stewart of standards."
5,Even better than his previous Motown album!,"Motown Two has barely left my CD player since I bought it. There's a really great mix of songs on here that Michael sounds like he was born to sing. The man sings these songs so passionately and powerfully. It's really a fantastic listening experience.It's hard for me to pick a favorite song off of here, but I've been playing Nowhere To Run and Tuesday Heartbreak an awful lot.The latter song was unknown to me before I got this CD, but this version is great. As for Nowhere To Run - Michael REALLY gets into it! The song totally jams. I hope it's released as a single. I think it could be a very big hit."
4,Good but not his best,"Michael McDonald is an awesome singer and performer and I enjoy his music very much.Without going into detail, I liked some of the songs on this album but there are allot of other Motown songs that his voice would compliment even better.Maybe on Motown 3."
4,'Two' Good!,"If not for any other reason, get this album for the gorgeous ""Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)"" Michael's duet with Toni Braxton. It's delicious!! The rest of the album is just as great as the first, if not better because this time we get some lesser known Motown gems."
4,McDonald is not trying to imitate anyone!,"Contrary to the negative voters on this forum, Michael McDonald is in no way trying to imitate the originators of these truly classic songs. He is simply offering, as he did in the Grammy-nominated first one, his take on these songs that have stood the test of time.Like the first one, McDonald has delved into the endless vault of Motown and come up with another barrage of hits, performed in his own unique style. The production on this album is somewhat larger, befitting its follow-up status, featuring guest performances from Stevie Wonder, Billy Preston, and Toni Braxton. Interesting vocal and accompaniment arrangements flatter these new versions of the old songs but don't diminish the originals' strengths.The disc deserves a 4 1/3 rating."
2,"Pretty pop, but NOT much soul!","Michael McDonald is undoubtedly a gifted musician but here he is WAY out of his league on this one. In Europe this album has been released as a special package with both of his Motown albums as a 2CD and knowing and loving the songs and Michael's reputation I did not hesitate.However, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that he has made these immortal tunes ""pretty"" and ""accessible"", but with little or absolutely no soul - which in my opinion is what Motown is/was all about.For REAL soul, instead turn to Ruby Turner's ""Motown Song Book"" from 1988 or for ""white"" soul: Daryl Hall's ""Soul Alone"" from the mid-90's or Hall & Oates' latest album: ""Our Kind of Soul"" from 2004. If you are a soul person, all three albums will get you up off your feet and are sure to floor McDonald again and again........."
2,It's a shame!,Short and to the point Michael. Quit ruining the music I grew up on and enjoyed listening to! A classic is a classic! Your renditions are far from them.
1,Terrible,"Are you freaking serious? How can you think that is even close to qualifying as music? Mikey has the uncanny ability to take classic songs and make me want to jam pencils in my ears. Smokey, the Temps, and everyone else that he rips off in these two cds should be pissed as hell, I know I am."
2,A Big Disappointment !,"After hearing his first Motown album (which was outstanding ! ), I anxiously waited for this releaseto hit the stores. Unfortunately, there are few, if any, songs on this album that I really enjoyed listening to. I don't know if it was his song selection, or his musical interpretation, but I simply did not like this album !My advice is to save your money and use it to buy a beerand pizza while you watch the world series tonight !"
2,Not Pleased,"I really like most anything Michael sings. However, when I first heard Motown I, I didn't like it and felt somewhat angry. Later, I realized that the source of my anger came from the realization that I would never hear many of the artists sing the song again because they were no longer with us. I did like Mike's arrangement for Since I Lost My Baby. When I heard Motown II was coming out, I wasn't happy AGAIN! The only cut I really like is Stop, Look, Listen with Toni Braxton. The second album smells a lot like, ""exploitation!"" Let it go, Mike. Just let it go. Let the songs stand on their own merit. They deserve it."
1,No-Talent Joker,"OK, I'll admit, I don't own this album. I was recently on a car trip with a friend, who played it for me. Michael McDonald is horrible. Not only does he have the most ridiculous voice to sign classic motown numbers, but his piano playing turns all of these songs into elevator music, which is exactly the reason they were cool in the first place. THEY WEREN'T ELEVATOR MUSIC. To buy this album is to accept mediocrity & give this sellout your hard-earned money. Don't be that guy. Have some integrity."
1,Michael McDonald Is A Mumbler!,"This a another compilation that should NOT have been made by Michael McDonald, just like his bomb ""Motown."" He is NOT capable of recording an album with any real meaning of soul. He cannot relive those heady days in Detroit where Berry Gordy had everyone, musicians and vocalists, in the same room kicking out the jams. In addition Michael McDonald is a cotton mouthed singer, where he NEVER enunciates the words and just mumbles to the point of not being able to be clearly heard or remotely understood. He needs a translator. I do not know who is his vocal coach/instructor was/is but they should be made to walk the plank."
3,Michael needs the Doobies back...,"I adore Michael McDonald's voice so I really want to like his albums because I want to listen to him. But after having listened to all of his latest stuff, I have to say that even though his voice is still fantastic, the cheesy studio music and mediocre production of the tracks makes them for me, unlistenable (don't know if that's a word, but you get the point.) Just when his voice begins to soar, I'll hear the cheesy drum machine, or some musak sounding backup singers. It destroys it for me. Michael needs to find himself a real rock & soul band to put him on top. Musicians who could match what he can do vocally, with a really great producer, is what's needed to make that most of that voice. I'm still waiting."
2,just aight,"Michael Mcdonald is a really Good Artist&I 've always been a fan of His work,but the Motown Albums ain't happening for me. it seems forced&to generic for my tastes. I can take a Medley but not two whole discs of this. Michael Mcdonald as Good of a Artist as he is&especially with His Voice&Piano Playing the Guy in alot of ways is the Pre-cursor to Nate Dogg, in that Him with the Doobie Brothers or using His voice behind Christopher Cross or Backing up has had more overall Impact than His own Solo Material aside from a few cuts. he hasn't gotten to truly shine as a Solo Artist as he did with steely Dan,Doobie Brothers,duet with James Ingram,etc...."
4,For special customers target.,It's a very good book. Through its pages you can learn the more modern concepts not only about argentine tango but also the most innovative dance techniques. The author break all the learning and teaching dance rules.
2,Lacking the Spanish names for the dance patterns,"I have been taking Tango lessons in the San Francisco Bay Area on and off for 3 years. The instructors always refer to the Spanish names of the patterns or moves, such as a ""Barrida"" or ""Curzada"". I wanted a book that would be a reference to the patterns I was using so I ordered this book.However, I was amazed to find that all the moves lack the Spanish name, instead using terms like ""front cross"", ""open step"". I cannot tie those patterns back to what I am learning and returned the book.I did like all the wonderful footwork diagrams in the book and would have been thrilled if they were titled with the Spanish name, such as ""ochos""."
1,Amazing,"The inconsistency of this book is amazing. It opposes any serious book written about the Argentine tango that I have encounter. I have found that in the introduction tango is presented as a free dance, and after that it comes chapter after chapter with non sense phrases."
3,What is missing,"Good book, but something is missing here. I beleive that the structures defined by the author are in need of a fourth dimension, which exists in the form of the concept of multiple instances of its own 3-dimensional plane. But this is rather a mental concept, which the author does not envision here. Maybe in the next volume."
4,Very Nice Surf CD,"Whenever I close my eyes to this CD, I am right there at Panama City Beach as a teenager. : ) The sound of the surf combined with the noise of the gulls are a nice combination. It's not to bad to sleep to either. The volume does fluxuate a bit (some waves coming in soft and others louder along with the gulls) but it usually doesn't bother me. Certainly worth getting!"
3,It's okay.,"Big breakers on a long beach with lots and lots of birds. I keep waiting to get bombed by one of them. Other than that, a perfectly acceptable surf record."
4,pretty good,"Shipping was fine. I don't think it works as some reviewers have stated. Its one of the better ones I've used but it doesn't leave your feet as smooth as I wanted. Its holding up pretty good, not much wear and tear."
2,too smooth,I wanted to find a non plastic foot buffer and I was so excited I found this. I was hoping this was rougher but its just not. I have to use the edge that is rough to get anything done.
4,Handmade for Profit is very helpful,This book is great. It is easy to read. This is one to keep for reference. It was extremely helpful for me regarding finding a niche for my work. I highly recommend this book!
4,Great collection of information!,Haven't had a chance to read alot of it- there is alot of information in the book. Great to refer back to time and again...
2,"Some useful info, but so annoying to read","I bought this book based on all the wonderful glowing reviews, but I have to be honest. This book is really annoying to read. While Barbara tries to include many types of crafts when giving examples, it's easy to see that her focus is the country/traditional theme (think teddy bears, calico, painted wood, corn husk dolls, etc.).Also, her references to religion and God seem out of place to me. Isn't this supposed to be a business book? Not all crafters are religious!I could deal with those things, other than for the fact that it seems like every other page has some sort of grammatical error or spelling mistake. Did she not have an editor? I looked for an editor's name in the front pages, but didn't see one... case in point: If you plan to publish a book, GET AN EDITOR. Or risk looking very unprofessional.There is some good information in this book, but I know I'll be hoping to re-sell my copy."
2,Half good half crap,I purchased 4 of these brushes and with all of them the side with the larger hairs (left side on the picture) sheds and is of poor quality for anything other than cleaning your shaver. On the other hand the smaller side works great and doesn't shed nearly as much if at all.
5,Excellent,The best one's so far. I use them on my two Norelco's but the original came apart. Maybe my fault.
1,ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.,I would give it zero stars but i cant if you are looking for david huntsinger go to davidhuntsinger dot com
4,"Touch read, yet informative","This book is a tough read, kind of like a text book in school. I bought notecards and I went through each chapter writing down things like deletions, presuppositions etc. This book is very VERY informative. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the basics of NLP.Richard Bandler wrote this book based on the teachings of a gentleman named Milton Erickson. And while all of the techniques in this book are valuable and should be used until they become part of your natural speech let me quote Milton Erickson who said.""The patterns the techniques, they're not important. What's important is desire for change.""Always remember that you can be the most athletic person in the world, but without the desire to win you will never excel above the rest; because above all, you need a strong frame of mind. The materials in this book coupled with a strong frame of mind will make you an expert communicator. Good Luck."
4,Starter book for future NLP Practitioners out there!,"Elegant book that will change your way at looking, hearing and feeling the world.A must read for future people who want to train with Richard, Anna, or even Rex.This one book will start your curious life into the one and only field of Neuro Linguistic Programming.I'm a life long practitioner!"
2,There are major flaws in this book.,"Not in content, per se, but in format. As far as I can tell, the book is a TRANSCRIPTION of a seminar. It just rambles, with no apparent organizational structure. No subtitles, no chapter divisions, no charts or graphs to relieve the rambling ... even the paragraph divisions seem to be arbitrary. There's only one break midway, which seemed to be the time when all the attendees went to lunch. I resented the authors' lack of work that went into this book. It could have been so much better."
5,WANT TO LEARN ABOUT NLP?,"The first ""how to"" for NLP. Every time you read it you will find something new. NLP has changed much over the years, yet Frogs remains a classic. A definite ""must have"" for any NLPer. Also out-of-print so get it now."
5,Will open your mind to a new therapy,"I am constantly amazed by the results of NLP. If it were used in a religious setting, the results would be called miracles. We have accessed the subconscious all the way back to the birth canal with phenomenal results. -Bob Barnick, Cetified Hypnotherapist"
4,.45 cal 1911 holster,It is a good holster. Looks very original and is it well made.Assembly is requiered and it is pretty difficult. The instructions are not very clear.
2,Disappointed but should have known,"Product was poor quality, tough to assemble and overall was a real waste. I would seriously considering going another direction for a should holster. I bought it because it was cheap and I thought what the heck but there is a reason for this......duh"
2,Illustrated Horsewatching,"A slim volume discussing horse gestures and behavior, as well as some horse-related trivia.I found lots of misinformation here -- everything from wild canines being sprint predators (they're distance chasers) to the idea that horses run races because they're frightened of the ""monster"" attacking them from behind (as a horse can see the jockey and the whip, even a really airheaded animal is unlikely to imagine a cougar) -- mostly in the service of an anti-racing screed. The photos are few and far between and lack captions.I thought that a much better book on this same topic was Robert Vavra's SUCH IS THE REAL NATURE OF HORSES."
3,Grandme 's review,"I bought this set for my 2yr.old grandson, he seemed excited to watch it, but it didn't hold his interest for long. The price was fine, I think it is geared for a child a bit older."
2,Performer is great; MP3 is only 5 seconds long,"My rating has nothing at all to do with the performer who sounds great to me, only with the goofy short length of the MP3 version of Pra Que Chorar.Hopefully the fault with the MP3 for Pra Que Chorar will be fixed but please beware that the purchased MP3 download is only 5 seconds long.I had assumed that the 5 seconds was only for the sample but that was not the case.I looked for other means to try to return this or contact Amazon about the concerns above and couldn't find a way since the order won't show up for returns although it does show up under my digital orders."
4,Lully's Masterpiece,"Lully's Armide by Les Arts Florissants, William Christie,is the greatest work that Lully produced.It is the best French Baroque Opera withRameau's Les Boreades.In Five Acts, Lully created a masterpiece.The music is in harmony with the singing drama.The DVD also has an interview, in French, ofWilliam Christie."
5,A feast for the ear and the eye,"A sneak peek at Versailles opens the opera. The singing, dancing, sets, and costumes are sublime. This is truly great music, performed with great care and skill."
3,"Beware, this is Eurotrash!","I let myself be convinced by all the positive reviews that this DVD has on Amazon.com, failing (to my regret) to fully appreciate Ben Franklin's negative review of it. The staging is tolerable in Acts I and V, but there are just parts of this production that sour the whole experience. Take, for example, those hairy-chested male demons in women's garb applying red lipstick on in Act III! Or the stark-naked female dancer in Act IV who is only thinly disguised behind some veils! (thankfully, she took good care of shaving her private parts before appearing in this production). Also, Mr. Carsen's decision to dress dancers as if they were tourists in the Prologue is perhaps acceptable, but dressing Ubalde and the Danish Knight in Act IV as such (with backpacks and all) is just too much for me. What a way to murder good taste. Lully must be rolling in his grave."
3,Warning - Eurotrash Haters Keep Away,"To put it bluntly, for me, there was very little worth watching here except for the subtitles. No quarrel with the beautiful music or performance but you can also get that, for less money, on Herreweghe's CD. In the documentary, Robert Carsen explains that he wanted the production to be based on tourists at Versailles going through Louis XIV's bedroom! I am not joking. Now what the heck does that have to do with Armide and Renaud? Carsen did a much more interesting job in the setting for Rameau's Boreades which while it had updated costumes, enchanted with its depiction of the seasons. In Armide, two colors, silverish gray and bright red monopolized the visual aspect. Some of the low points were Paul Agnew in his briefs on a bed singing on his knees and a devil character with a hairy chest in a red dress. Save your money."
2,A Remix Project,"Jiani was not an artist who produced a real body of work to justify a Greatest Hits collection, and so this 4 track ep serves the purpose of covering the highlights. Unfortunately, the best song, ""Hit And Run Lover"" is in remixed form here. The strings have been all but eliminated and the horns set WAY back in the mix. Anachronistic synthesizers have been added, making the track sound like album filler from a mid-80's synth group. The poignancy of the lyrics are no longer supported by the melancholy strings and overall the song is diminished."
4,Cute Babysitting Guide,"This is a cute babysitting guide for someone just starting out. It gives tips from how to settle kids down to go to bed, to how to keep them entertained. This is a nice ""pocket"" guide that you shouldn't leave home without."
4,Babysitting Available,"This is one of the best books I have ever read on the subject babysitting. It has the best tips on what to do and how to do it. If you want to buy a babysitting book then you should buy this one or one like it: 'The Babysitters Club-Guide to Babysitting' by Jahnna Beecham and Ann Matthews Martin. (the author of 'The Babysitters Club') If your child or even you want to be a babysitter and need help, buy this book now!"
4,"Great writer, not so good shape of book","I love the writer, very informative book. But it was damaged by previouse owner folding/dogeared. pagees. I will have to tape them because they were bend for a bit it greated a grease which wanted to come off. and some one also underlined heavely leaving makes.Other than that the book came sooner than expected and it has a wealth of information which is helpfull for us who struggle with Aspergers"
4,Very informative,I learned a lot from this book. First I can recognize some of the sensory defensives in myself and I now know that my symptoms are mild.I thought the case studies in the book were a bit on the extreme side.
3,Sensory Understanding!,"This book is full of sensory information, but took me some time to get it all."
2,Completely not what I thought it was,"I obtained this book in hopes of learning more about Sensory processing disorder/Sensory Integration disorder. I had not realized that this book applies to adults with the condition, and therefore was not useful for helping children.It does contain information that is very helpful to adults with SPD, but if you are looking for a book to help your child, this one isn't it.Again, nice book, but it would have been helpful to know if was for what adults who have SPD could do to help themselves."
5,Did Sharon Heller interview me??,"I truly feel as if Sharon Heller came to my house and interviewed me for her book. I could really identify with so much of what was written and I thought it explained so wonderfully to those who don't have a sensory defensive disorder what it feels like for those who do. For so many years I have known that I was somehow odd, or laughed with my friends because I knew I had a lot of rules about how I lived. Now I know there is a name for what I experience. I am very excited to try some of the ideas Ms. Heller gives on how to cope better like massage, craniosacral, and controlling my breathing.I highly recommend this book for adults who may feel as if they are more sensitive than others to sights, sounds, textures. As a busy mom of 3 kids I read this 300+ page book in a day and a half!!"
3,Check this out!,"I found this book while looking for ADD information. I am so glad that I did. I just recently found out about Sensory Integration Dysfunction. This book is very informative in explaining how this disorder is woven into your life and how it plays out in different people. When reading it I found myself saying, ""That sounds just like me"". The language is a little hard to understand with some of the technical jargon but the sample stories to show how people live with this disorder are great and help the reader to understand what it means. This is overall a good book but I find it just a little to long. If it was more direct and more in layman's terms I would have found it to be better. All in all though, it is good for someone who needs more information on the disorder."
4,Great Read,"I received this book from a friend who thought I might find it useful and so I did. This book is well-written, in clear and easy to understand language. If you are one who suffers from hypersensitivity to sounds, scents, etc, this book is well worth checking out. It gives great guidelines for helping the sensory defensive adult learn to be less hypersensitive to the simple things in life that many others can simply tune out, as well as making it clear that sensory defensiveness is a physiologic problem rather than a psychological one. Recommended for both those who are or may be sensory defensive as well as those who live with sensory defensives."
5,too loud too bright too fast too tight,Eye-opening book that gives a lot of insight to how the mind and brain functions to outside sources in the world.
3,Sensory Avoiders this is for you,"This is a good book for people who are sensory avoiders. It helps you figure out why you don't like certain things (noises, crowds, clothes, etc)Be advised it will not help if you or your child are sensory seekers."
2,Great for extreme sensory defensives only,"This book is too dense and redundant. Though I applaud Sharon Heller's attempt to bring this issue to the mainstream, it seems only to apply to the most severely affected people and not to less extreme cases. Additionally, the only real suggestions for help seemed to point to seeing a specialist. I really could not find anything practical to help with my ""oversensitivity"". I did notice the author tends to mention ""brushing your skin,"" yet never really tells what that is, but rather refers the reader to a specialist. One last comment, the type is very, very small and irritating to read. Bottom line: Great for extreme sensory defensives, but overly detailed and redundant for those of us moderately so. Offers no substantial or practical self-help solutions."
3,"Amazon selling volume 2 only, starting on page 281.","Amazon does not make it clear that you are buying only volume two. Of course I would like volume one also.I have the two volume set from the 1940's, but the mold smell makes it impossible to read. So I bought this Amazon copy, but as said it is only volume two. And yes, the bottom few lines of each page are blurry or unreadable. So not the quality I would have expected from Amazon."
3,Theory is out of date,"This book is an interesting example of how a well-educated European between the wars evaluated history, but its theories have been discredited by subsequent events, and the problems go far deeper than the use of the word ""Aryan"". For example, Wells said that the ""natural"" division of Europe into nations was to group people by language. Two decades later Hitler was to use this theory to invade neighboring countries to ""rescue"" German-speaking communities. And when Wells talks about ""communities of will"", doesn't that remind you of the Nazi propaganda movie TRIUMPH OF THE WILL? Of course Wells didn't agree with the Nazi Germans; he was just being naive."
2,It's not what you think,"Wells is a wonderful writer, it is true; however, his bigotry and hatred of certain peoples and of religion is very apparent. His political leanings are also too apparent--it is not an unbiased book and may give some the wrong impression of world events. I am currently reading the book updated just after WWII."
1,Horrible printing - Blurry pages,Near the bottom of each page the type was offset and blurry to the point of being not readable. Horrible that people sell this book at all. Where is the QA?
3,"Expensive, but worth it?","I purchased this as an alternative to the much cheaper ones you buy at ""Wally World"". I am impressed with the quality. So far it seems to be holding up well, but I wonder if they will last long enough to be cost effective?"
4,Good attempt to look at the harsher side of Rome,"This is a great book for pre-teens, teens, and even adults who like fiction set in the ancient world. Here we see the harsh social realities faced by foundlings in the life of Beric, Roman child adopted from the sea by Britons during the Roman Empire -- when exactly isn't given. While I'm glad the attempt was made to show the harshness of life both in the north and then among the Romans there was still a bit of sugar-coating that is perhaps the result of wanting to respect our own morals or the result of a lack of knowledge. Thus the sexual terror and abuse of slavery is not mentioned and there is the idea that slaves have special clothes or jewelery to mark their status which is not the case unless one had been a runaway or a master really wanted to use a collar or brand or tattoo. The ending was also a bit too positive but then again most people don't want to read a sad tale even if it is more realistic."
5,Great Item!,Received product on time as promised in excellent condition. Product is a delight to use in my gourmet dishes. Fun to use on desserts or in chocolate drinks!
4,Communicators MUST read,"The Elements of Public Speaking is a textbook i used for the course of public speaking this year. Surprisingly, it's not only a textbook, but also an useful book for all communicators. It provides a clear concept to be a successful public speaker - good communication skills, avoid using jargons and comfortable eye contacts, etc. Anyways, it's a MUST-READ guidebook for all public speakers and communicators as well."
3,THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS THAN THIS ONE,"This book's title should be ""HOW BOSCH FUEL INJECTION WORKS"". There are very few ideas on how to modify your bosch fuel injection. The book explains how the fuel injection works and give some data on fuel injection systems installed in some cars. I have also bought other book: ""Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management"" that is definitely a better, more comprehensive, more descriptive book. Although there is just one thing that this book has, that ""Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management"" doesn't: how to tune the volumetric air flow meter. Ben Watson(the author) knows very well what he is talking about, so he doesn't bother explaining deep enough how every piece work. You better buy ""Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management"" by Charles O. Probst."
3,many good points and information for the beginer,Many good points and lots of information and specifications for all bosch systems. From the earliest VW systems to the latest. The modify section is short and lacks greatly. Ben Watson says almost nothing about modifing anything.
2,Pretty Disappointing...,"The title of this book is ""How to Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection"". Well, is says almost nothing about modifying and tuning. Most of the content is about how the Bosch fuel injection works, and the differeces between the various models, but again, not what I was looking for..."
1,dont bother,This book is garbage. There are many words that have the same meaning as garbage that I would love to put here as well but I wont waste your time the way this book wasted mine. The bosch fuel injection book you need is the one by charles probst.
2,not the best,this book wasn't too helpful. it's tough to navigate and not factory backed. if i were you i'd buy the bently manual.
1,Disappointing,"Back in the year 2000 I ordered this book, plus another 2 books about engines, written by Ben Watson...Unfortunately, I was not aware that ratings by readers were available at Amazon, or reviews had not been entered yet...Good books on these subjects are available, and the readers are rating them with 4 and 5 stars ...I am not surprised that other readers also gave a low rating to this book, because the title is misleading."
1,Buy the bently book.,"Bosch Fuel Injection and fuel management by Bently Publishing is a much better book, with all the same information plus more. This book has nothing to do with modifying or tuning fuel injection, it is mostly concerned with troubleshooting and theory of operation."
3,1st half of the book was very good but...........,"I read about 10 books a year, all non-fiction, mostly military but also some bios & auto-bios. I completely lost interest in this book about 3 chapters from the end! I've never done that before. I either love a book & keep reading & or don't like how it's written & put it down by chapter 2 or 3. The book really sucked me in telling about Randy Wurst & what he & other guys went through......then somewhere around 3/4 through the book I just didn't feel like I was into it anymore. I often buy 2 or 3 books at a time so I picked up Delta Force by Col. Charlie Beckwith & BOOM I was good again. I wished that book kept going!"
4,Well informed and factual,"My son is a Captain in the Special Forces Green Berets. This gave me a good insight into his life now as a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha Commander. From his start to his many deployments since getting his Green Beret. He does not share much about his experiences as he is not allowed, so this was a good read for me."
5,One of the best on this subject,"As someone interested in joining the Special Forces, this is one of the best books I've been able to find. In fact it is THE best as far as learning about the structure, missions, and operations of the Army Special Forces. The author chronicles the careers of several soldiers specifically throughout the book, but also writes more generally about a wide array of SF missions. Furthermore, the book is entertaining enough to hold the attention of readers that may not be interested in joining SF. For a good book on the training of Special Forces soldiers see Dick Couch's ""Chosen Soldier."""
2,Excellent? I think Not,"I hate to say it but this book is not very well written. However, I will concede that it might be me. I would have liked to read about more of the action and ""Chaos"" these operators deal out. It seems the writer listened to a few stories and made do with what she had. The empty space was filled with cliches. Also, there were few citations or foot notes; you just have to take the authors word for it. She wasted a perfect chance to get the real story."
4,"Good book overall, some lingering issues","Despite the fact that I'm mostly going to gripe, I did like the book quite a bit. But a few things did catch my eye:By focusing so tightly on actions of a few individuals, the overall picture sometimes is not given enough detail.Ahmed Chalabi is really painted with a black brush in the book. Objectively speaking, other Arab VIP personages do pretty much the same things he is denigrated for yet escape any opprobation.Mrs Robinson has problem with non-US weapons identification. G3 is not an Israeli rifle, but rather a German one. I suppose these particular rifles may've been sold by an Israeli intermediary, but it still doesn't make them Israeli. Or the witness confused G3 with FN-FAL, which were used by Israel at one point. Regardless, something is not quite right. Likewise, UK does not have any ""Tiger"" light tanks - perhaps she was told about a Scimitar or Sabre."
3,Wait for another book,"I know I gave this three stars, however it was a hesitant three stars. The book had potential. I did learn some details, however minute, about the invasion of Iraq and SF involvement. I have no doubts the SF guys in Iraq had amazing stories to tell. However firefights were reduced to a few sentences. Several SF guys were awarded Silver Stars following the Iraq invasion. I would imagine a better author could have told the stories in a much more interesting manner. I would recommend Horse Soldiers by Doug Stanton."
4,Excellent modern history of covert operations,"This book is a must read for those interested in Special Operations. It is easily one of the best written and encompassing books. The last half of the book deals extensively with the success special operations soldiers had in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the troubles once conventional units and the Pentagon bureaucracy took over."
2,Missleading title and cover,"Goes to show you that you better read all of the reviews. I didn't like the author's style of writing and sure didn't care for her written opinion, which is throughout the book and primarily at the end. I made myself finish this one, but I wouldn't ever purchase another book by this author."
3,????,I HATED THE BOOK. I ADMIRED THE HEOICS THE SF's have and show during each operation but mixing it with the politics is just wrong. As a soldier it is not their job to comment on freeing individual or any country but when they do that the whole story came apart.
1,Mistress of Chaos,A superficial treatment of a complex subject. Why didn't Robinson talk to anyone outside of Special Forces? What about the often questionable deployment of these units? What about all the unecessary death and destruction they frequently leave behind? Why didn't the author investigate the military's reckless disregard for the health and safety of these dedicated soldiers when abundant examples can be found in their training and during and after combat? I'd have given this book zero stars but that wasn't one of the choices.
5,The Ultimate Study in Greed and Hubris,"I bought this book when it first came out and have reread it every year or so. Tends to be a bit long and sometimes slow, but it's great. Buy a used copy, or check at the library.Being from the Washington D.C. area I kept constantly asking why someone didn't leak this to the press and blow the whole compiristy.The only comparable book is ""The Great Salad Oil Swindle"""
4,feinstein does fiction,"As a reader of John Feinstein's more popular works, such as A Season on the Brink, A Civil War, etc., I couldn't resist reading his attempt at fiction. This is a story about an unemployed sports reporter who stumbles across some disturbing information about a standout high school basketball player from the reporter's childhood town. The book is a fast read, and overall, good and entertaining. Although the ending is unrealistic, I recommend the book to those who enjoy Feinstein's anecdotes of real-life college sports."
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR DATA TRANSFER,Do not buy this if your goal is to transfer data from one computer to another. It does not work.
3,"USB cable, but didnt work for me.",I tried to connect two tech products together... A PS3 and Apples time capsule. I have yet to get the cable to work with a device...
4,I don't know if it's working or not,"The cable didn't advertise having a software disk with it. I got that software, I think, from the internet. So far I haven't been able to transfer the data from my old computer to my new one. I don't know if it's the cable or not. But it was cheap and if it is I'll just get another one."
1,Does Not Seem To Work,Bought it to use in data transfer from a Compaq manufactured in 2000 to a HP Pavilion Elite manufactured last month. Nothing happened. The Pavilion recorded nothing or indicated nothing in Win 7. I noticed this cable is not advertised as USB 2.0.
2,=(,Not the cord I needed...I was told I could use this to transfer from PC to PC....FALSE it didnt even recognize either computer.
5,USB cable -,"As always, the item was received in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I appreciate the care taken to ensure whatever I purchase is safely shipped and of course, the timely arrival of items is also very appreciated.You can count on my return business and I always share my satisfaction with Amazon.com."
3,LONG BUT WORKS,"THE CABLE ORDERED WAS TO BE 6 FOOT LONG,THIS ITEM WAS APPX 10 TO 12 FEET LONG.AS THE ENDS WERE CORRECT AND THE PRODUCT WORKED JUST FINE NO COMPLAINTS."
2,StarTech USB cable 6 ft,"If you have a USB-powered device that requires a significant amount of current (e.g., a 2.5"" HDD), this 6 feet of USB cable might represent too much impedance to deliver sufficient power to the device. Depends on the power source and the device - not necessarily the fault of the cable, but buy the shortest practical length."
3,Quality looks good,I bought this USB cable to connect my digital frame to my computer and expected that I can move the photos from PC to digital frames. It didn't work. I guess that i need a drive or something. the cable itself can be plugged in very easy. And the price is worth to try.
1,Cheap - but din't work for the intended purposes,I bought this to connect my hard disk to my TV. But it did not work. Neither did this connect my laptop to the hard disk. I guess it's only use is to connect the PC to a hub.
5,Works fine,"Reasonable price, seems to be constructed as well as any USB cable, fits snugly, and carries data reliably. That's about all you can ask."
1,Bad recommendation by AMAZON,"This item was a better with recommendation by Amazon. The cable won't fit the Canon Scanner I bought The CanoScan scanner is USB powered and does NOT have a standard USB outlet on it. I changed my Amazon order to NOT include this cable as Canon supply's the proper cable, but I was charged for one anyway."
4,Harrison's stuff has really matured,This is really an excellent record. George's stuff has matured quite well in these latter days. I love the opening track.
2,Over-rated sloppy album,"While '33 1/3' probably relates to Harrison's age at the time, AND the speed of an LP, it may also mean this album is faster than Extra Texture.But while it's a bit faster, it's a bit sloppier as well, despite haivng a better reputation amongst fans and critics. The songwriting is a bit stronger but the delivery is even weaker.'33 1/3' is an album drenched in a sea of fluid tones of flanger and electric piano, then a smattering of organs and synthesisers, and somewhere in the background are George's awkward, meandering vocals.The best song is probably the opening 'Woman don't cry for me'; it's straightforward and easier to understand the vocals. 'This song' and 'See yourself' are well delivered, the other songs are sloppier, although 'Beautiful Girl', 'Crackerbox Palace' and 'Dear One' are good songs. Rating 2/5"
5,This book explains it all...why the facts are just the beginning,I first read this book three years ago and since then attended the SalesBrain training twice. Now I understand why presenting the facts alone is not enough to drive to a decision. Learning about the SalesBrain method has been one of the most valuable investments I have made in my professional career in marketing.
4,"Great book, poor editing.","I really enjoyed this book, but the copy I purchased was poorly edited and a bit difficult to read."
2,ok,I had ordered this for my Dad and ended up returning it because of the spool. The spool just spins freely so it pretty easy to end up with a tangled mess. It's a shame that the manufacturers overlooked this basic design flaw in a otherwise seemingly sturdy piece of equipment.
3,Not all we expected,"Basically, we were impressed with the value of these Tupperware bowles, but the lid for the largest bowl appeared to be too small. I (the male household member) was able to force the lid on the largest bowl, but my wife could not. The other lids (2) fit perfectly."
2,Not Quite Shakespeare's Worst,"The only play Shakespeare wrote that I did not like at all was ""Othello."" ""All's Well That Ends Well"" was never that popular. It lacks the hilarious tone of ""The Comedy of Errors,"" the superb construction of ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" or the profound messages of ""The Merchant of Venice."" Also, we can very well be in two minds of what to think of Bertram's rejection of Helena. The characters are not that convincing, and much of the humour is based on bad taste. But the play is not quite a flop. There are moments of suspense. There is some delightful comedy (especially when Bertram chooses to stay in battle rather than go home and marry Helena). And at times, Helena is memorable. I would not make time to read this play, but then it's not a waste of time either."
3,OK book,"Since this will probably be a requirement for a class, I guess it doesn't matter what I think. But, some of the exercises, to me, weren't very clear and did require the instructor to give more examples."
5,Great Mattress,"I love this mattress. I bought it for my daughter and it is so comfortable. I am thinking of purchasing a queen size for myself, it is so easy to sleep on. I highly recommend it."
5,A Nice Mystery,"I happen to have the entire collection of Amanda Grange's Books, many which are now out of print. The is a delightful author who I have admired greatly. I particullary liked this book with the hero a dashing good looking man. Lots of twists and turns before it ends with a happy ending. I am so glad that several of Amanda's books are now available on ebooks."
5,Okay read,It was a good story. Not her best book that I have read but would diffently read another of her books
4,Fun escapism,"This was a short, fun story. While a lot happens that is quite ridiculous if taken as fact, it works just fine for an escapist read. Think of it as a condensed version of a full-blown historical romance."
4,Useful !,"Don't just enjoy the paintings, this book gives spot on needed information about perspective and the bones that make a good watercolor."
3,No More Morning Sickness,"While the book was worthwhile to have on hand as a guide, I feel strongly that the title and the first chapters are misleading--they suggest to the reader that if you follow Erick's theory and identify those few magic foods for you, you will stop vomiting, put on weight and be cured. Wrong. Basically, morning sickness is a hormonal phenomenon that your body has to ride out, in its own time. Neither nutritionists nor health practitioners, holistic or mainstream, really understand it or know what to do about it. Following Erick's premise will help you to identify those few foods that will help you feel less bad, and that you can keep down most of the time, but if you have it bad, time is the only cure. Take it from someone who's tried everything in the course of more than 10 weeks. The book should be retitled to ""Surviving Morning Sickness."""
2,Slide does not slide.,"I wanted this toy very much and I victimized my budget to buy it. Reviews were very good, but nobody said that slide on this toy actually does not slide! And I took it only for this slide. My daughter looks disappointed even more than me. What can I say? If that don't matter to you the toy is good, but again not for this prise. Would not recommend it, unless somebody can tell me how to slide on this thing."
3,Over-priced,"My daughter, who is five years old, saved up her allowance money to buy this toy. It's basically a teddy bear shaped like a carriage. The wheels don't turn, nor does it have any moving parts. I'm disappointed by the toy because it isn't very interesting. That said, my daughter likes the toy very much. She puts her Groovy Girls into the carriage, hitches up her Groovy Unicorn, and flies them around the house. I, personally, would give this toy 1 star, my daughter would give it 5 stars. I gave it the average of our two votes, just to be fair."
5,Worked great for me!,Had no problems while changing the spark plugs in my '04 Odyssey. Really satisfied with the purchase...genius idea and seems well-made.
1,Absolute junk,"I bought socket this because I needed to change spark plugs that are in a deep, nearly-vertical well.The very first time I pulled a spark plug out of the socket, the magnetic ring stayed with the plug instead of staying attached to the socket. I put it back in the socket a couple of times, but it always came back out with the plug -- okay for removing plugs but useless for putting new ones in. After four tries, the ring broke into two pieces; luckily neither one ended up in the engine.That explains the difference between a more-typical $50 magnetic socket and this $10 one -- you get what you pay for. This one isn't worth it."
5,FRIGGIN AWESOME,"Read the previous reviews, decided to give it a try, use it everyday and Friggin Love it! As a Mechanic by trade i am always breaking my tools and magnetic spark plug sockets are no exception. This one is designed correctly and just gives me smiles when i need to pull a plug now. Do yourself a favor and get every wrenching guy or girl one of these sockets today. The'll love it!"
4,A good general set,"This set has worked well for me; I'm not a heavy drill user, but for my purposes it has everything I need, and multiple drill bits of the more popular (and the more breakable!) sizes. The different drill bit types could be labelled more clearly, or indeed at all! I keep a cutout from the cardboard box inside which lists the different types of drill bit and how many of each, so I can work out from that which are the masonry bits, which the general purpose, etc."
3,Seems Cheaply Made,"The carrying case is made from cheap, easily deformed plastic, it rips, bends and contorts very easily. I have a similar bit set made by black & decker and the the carrying case is made of hard plastic and is very durable. Nothing like this brand. The bits don't stay in their slots very well; when I received the item most of the bits were loose and rattling around. Also, I feel the bits are cheaply made and won't last very long.Overall, I'd stay away from this product and go with something from a reputable brand the Black & Decker, Stanley or Craftsman."
1,Cheap,"First time I needed to use the set I had to drill holes in 1/8th"" steel. Broke 4- 5/8th drill bits just drilling 3 holes. Plus I had to use the broken pieces to finish the job!!!!!!"
4,Very nice around the house bit set.,This set is not for the hardcore DYSer or contractor... it is best for the weekend-warrior guy or gal that just bought their first real drill and plans to get some things done around the house. The case is very flimsy and will not hold up to being tossed around the back of your truck or on the job sight. Bits will break but there are enough of them that you can still get the job done close enough for a long time before you have to replace them. I give it 4 stars because the price is good and not 5 because I think that the case could have been better.
5,Great Book!,I am a Vietnam veteran. As such I like to read books about the military of today. Their patriotism is inspiring!
5,book review,"My son loves this book and has spent much time reading it. It took a little while for it to arrive,but it has been worth the wait."
4,America's Elite Counter-Terrorist Unit,"This was a fascinating book covering a fascinating topic. The creation of ""Delta Force"" is a topic that should interest all military history buffs. Col Beckwith gives a blow by blow account of the obstacles endured in creating Delta. He sometimes drowns you in the day to day bureacratic fight but the reader gets an appreciation for the difficulties he faced. Col Beckwith gives an excellent narrative of the fiasco at ""Desert One"" in 1980 while attempting to save the American hostages in Iran. It was a difficult time for all Americans and most would not wish to be reminded, but lessons are to be learned. And in order to learn those lessons Col Beckwith takes us back to that night in the desert. Overall a very informative read."
4,"Worth Reading, Good History of Desert One and Other Things","Well worth the money and the book reads fast. The prologue itself is a history lesson in itself and offers insights into Carter, Mondale, and Warren Christopher that few see. The account of Col. Beckwith's service is both interesting and impressive and the perspective he offers on the Desert One mission is unmatched.If you are a student of special ops warfare this is definitely a welcome addition to your shelf. I concur again with the reviewer from Ft Bragg and would suggest THE RAID if you can get it and would also add SPEC OPS by William McRaven. DELTA FORCE is both a good biography of an American patriot but also a good reference on the evolution of both American special operations thinking and resolve.Bottom line -- BUY this book if you like reading real life histories of modern warriors, Col. Beckwith will not disappoint you."
2,"If you don't like minutiae, don't buy it...","Reading the inside two pages of rave reviews, I expected the book to be far more gripping than it was. It started out great but quickly slid into tons and tons of small details about how hard it was to establish this unit. Every paper clip, every memo, every argument - just too much dull info. Perhaps if you like this kind of thing it's a great read. I found it overall a boring book. Finally, when it got to the failed hostage rescue I think he covered it in about 5 pages. I would not recommend it to MY friends."
2,Way to much detail about nothing,"All due respect to Colonel Beckwith, but he should have titled the book, 'Most of my years in the Army, Delta Force comes towards the end'. He goes into so much detail about all the B.S. he went through and whatnot. There are 4.5 million Generals you have to keep straight. Which ones are on his side, and which ones aren't. Then when you think you've got it down, he sprinkles in about 1.8 million more. It would be a great read for anyone who is looking to start another Tier One Counter-terrorist unit. But beyond that it's kind of a boring read."
3,Delta Force,The book arrived on time and in the agreed upon condition. I have not finished the book yet but so far the author comes across as too strongly opinionated and cocky. Not knowing much about Beckwith's personality I can't say whether it is accurate or not.
1,no action...only political infighting,Don't read this if you expect lots of action...only lots of political infighting as Beckwith tries to get Delta Force established will others in the defence establishment want to stop him encroaching on their territory...
3,second best,"if you are looking for insight to the beuracracy of washington and the military read this book, if you're looking for sweet delta force stories read ""inside delta force"" by eric haney"
3,"Good book, but they muck up a lot don't they?","This book is reasonably well written and details about the US Special Forces unit Delta Force. Overall it is a good account, but I have to say, having read many accounts of the SAS (Bravo Two Zero, Eye of the Storm...) they sound to be the better group of soldiers. Delta Force seem to muck up... a lot........"
2,boring...,"Delta Force was the most boring book I've ever read. It is like reading a school history book. There is seldom ever any excitement. The book has names, dates, and places about how Beckwith became involved in Delta Force. He talks about his time in Vietnam and in the Iran hostage rescue (the only two things that spark up some excitement). Other than that, this book was very boring. ... Also, I have to admit that Beckwith did a great job writing it."
5,Another Winner from Amazon,"Factual and truly fascinating even to those totally unfamiliar with this era and the subject manner. It brings illumination to a side of the war largely unknown by the civilians back home.... While it is told in an easy to read chat type format, it is still packed with information and details seldom available. Another must read for the student of that era and war as well as the vets who remember it all too well..."
1,Bait and switch,Do not recomend this vender item advertised in stock then they said they wanted to sustitute due to non stock sounds like a bait and switch to me
1,this is dissapointing. bad for business!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......,first they were selling the product. and now they dont have it. this is dissapointing to me. i wanted these speakers and there sold out..... what a waste of business!!!!.
4,"""A Good Introduction""","I love these postcard books put out by Bruno Gmunder. This edition #16 of David Vance's photographs is a must for any collector. It's a great representation of his wonderful photography, and in addition, it's a great way to keep in touch with friends and at the same time brighthen their day with a hot photo of young good-looking men. If you're not able to own the hardcover book this is a great way to still have a chance to enjoy David's photography at a very affordable price. If you're a collector this postcard book is a must, along with the other 15 editions previously published of other photographers."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this video. I bought it to use with a group of Cub Scouts (3rd grade) who are earning their Weather Belt Loop. I love weather, but this video is boring! The exciting things that kids want to watch -- tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, etc. -- are just barely touched on in short video clips. The video skims the surface of weather and doesn't linger on anything long enough to really entertain OR inform you. The recurring motif of the rotating rooster weather vane gets really annoying after a while."
4,Solid Overview Reference for Project Managers & Analysts,"Dispite the 300+ pages, I was able to finish this book in a day. It provides clear and concise information on how to manage a data warehousing project, caveats & pitfalls, and differences between DW technologies & strategies. The first half of the book focuses on step-by-step DW project management and methodology. The second half focuses on technologies and concepts. However, I felt that the second half of the book was not as strong as the first (probably because technology changes constantly). If you want a book that gives you a step-by-step task list that can be easily transferred to a MS Project plan, then this is the book you want!"
5,A priceless set!,"To affirm that Pablo Casals was the greatest musician of the XX Century may result for some a mere speculation or an emotive utterance, but under the light his personal achievements and his ceaseless effort for making of the music a true statement of principles, plus the materialization of a long dream, the Prades, Puerto Rico and Marlboro festivals seem to confirm it.This is an invaluable musical legacy from his genius. These recordings are hovered by a sidereal approach, in which the radiant musicality and lyrical splendor remains bellow every one of these Concertos.So, please don't let to pass these admirable recordings that are now part of a recent past."
5,A Musical Treasure and Artistic Legacy,"Interpreted with a vitality that belies this remarkable octogenarian's age, the individual ""voices"" within the orchestra are heard with a clarity that suggests the listener is present at the performance. Impeccable musicianship under Casals's baton. The Marlboro Festival Orchestra is comprised of the finest artists of the time.Rhythmic drive and ""expressive intonation"" practices epitomize the artistry of Casals."
4,these line blocks are well worth the money,"marshalltown trowell makes a very durable line block, their wood construction makes for a dependable grip and prevention of slipage."
2,Towel bar is of poor quality,Can't believe that Moen now makes a shoddy product. My previous Moen towel bar that I needed to replace was made much better than this. It's lasted for 10 yrs. I don't think this one will last 1 yr. I contacted Moen by e-mail and they only stated that if it didn't hold up that they would replace it. I don't plan on buying anymore Moen products.
5,Company came through,"Change my review to excellent, they came through and got this to me by Xmas. Quality of belt and pouches exceeds what is expected. Have a belt for twenty years and paid big bucks. This one is better quality and better price."
3,McGuire 490X 12 pocket carpenter apron,It was exactly what was specified by the person who will receive it as a gift. I'm sure he will find lots of uses for it.
4,Great Gate,"We have a 5 month old Doberman puppy that will soon have to be left alone for long periods. We didn't want him to be cooped up in his crate so we installed this gate to give him the whole kitchen to roam around and play in. So far it has held up really well. He's only recently begun putting his paws up on it, and is immediately given the ""off"" command when he does so, but the gate hasn't shown any signs of breaking when he does this. I had read some reviews that people had issues with the plastic joiner pieces breaking...they won't break if you're just smart enough to loosen them before you try to move the gate's position. We did have some problems installing it but that was more an issue of the crappy construction of our rental's walls than the gate. The only real complaint I have is that it can be a bit of a hassle to take apart to fold and store when you don't want it up. But with the gate we don't have to do that often. So far we love this product!"
1,Not as described,"I thought I was purchasing a Carlson pet gate. The item description and the packaging stated that the gate was white. The gate I received is a tan/brown. I strongly suspect that the gate I received was generic and not a Carlson brand. The gate is very flimsy and the latch does not work correctly. There are two stickers, which read Carlson, on the latch, but I believe these stickers were created and placed on the gate so that it appears to be of that brand. The gate pieces are three different colors. Nothing matches. I have other Carlson gates and they are very sturdy and good quality. This gate is a knock-off and somebody is using the Carlson name on their generic product."
3,A-N is not the whole alphabet!,"It is in the product description that this game only covers letters A-N. Unfortunately, I didn't see that. Who would do an alphabet game with only half of the alphabet? Kind of disappointing after I got so excited to find what looked like a good alphabet game in Spanish..."
4,I vote for Jonathan Carr! When does Kirkus have to pay up!,"I agree with the reader reviewer who stated that Carr's presentation was balanced and portrayed Mahler ""warts and all"" - therefore, also putting a human and sympathetic face on this titan for me (not much sympathy for Alma though!). I found the book facinating and as a new ""Mahlerian"", an excellent guide and entry point for his work. Bravo Jonathan Carr!"
4,Elucidating and interesting,"This is a great book for those who do not have the time to plod through the de La Grange tomes on the life of Mahler. Carr shows another face of Mahler, and that while he was a giant in the late 19th century music world, he had extremely poor taste in women! Carr's writing style is interesting and engaging. The only criticism is that he gives short schrift to the Ninth Symphony, including only 1 paragraph of analysis for such an important work!!"
2,"Carr's ""Mahler"" cooked up","It's hard to believe that a book this thick and on such a compelling subject could be so disappointing. It begins ambitiously, and soon peaks with a single insightful paragraph drawing a parallel between the music of Berlioz and Mahler, but then gets down to the real business: lambasting poor old Alma, yet again. This exposition proves to be British in the worse sense--gossipy, slight, and tedious. Granted there's a ton of detail proving Alma wrote down the wrong date and time for the dinner party with Gustav, but do we really care? Carr moves in the direction of redeeming his effort with a compassionate and accurate account of Mahler's time in America, his final illness and death. That is 64 pages out of 254. May Amazon offer those in excerpt at 75% off!"
5,Simply wonderful music!,"If a person likes Spanish and Latin music, they will love this one. I highly recommended this CD."
5,Soul of Spain,"OMG, this cd along with the Mexico ""sister"" cd, came the same day. I've always loved 101 Strings, and the 1960's recordings here are awesome. The first song on the album is almost 15 minutes long, but the music captures the soul and fire of the Iberian peninsula like no others. It's formal and quixotic all in one, just as the people of Spain are. Absolutely must-listening for the purists. Again while it's in cd format I don't believe it is acoustically as good as newer music since it was copied from the original tapes. However, it is good -- VERY good -- and highly recommended."
3,All of the original cuts are on Madacy Records 2 Discs: 2 Discs UPC: 62826124762,"To recapture the music in its entirety, the Soul of Spain [Digipack] is most superb; a nostalgic treasure!"
3,Don't know,"I am not sure if this would help someone else learn to knit or not. I still don't know how. I am more of a show me and I can do it kind of person, but didn't gain much form this. But then, maybe its me. I want to learn to knit, but this dvd set didn't do it for me."
4,"good for beginners, makes it easy","Yes, there are things about this video that are a little annoying, but, the bottom line is that the directions are clear and easy to follow so even a novice knitter can complete the projects. There are lots of good close ups, and she uses nice big needles and yarn so it is easy to see what she is doing. If you are a beginner knitter, get this DVD, it will really help you get started."
5,Beginning Knitter,"Applause, applause for this OUTSTANDING video. The instructor gives clear, explicit directions and the camera shots are excellent. The instructor speaks clearly and is pleasant to look at. Her directions are easy to follow and reinforces each lesson with a review. I highly recommend this video. You will be most pleased."
2,Pretentious and Tedious Play,"I felt that this play was a bit self indulgent and even a little masturbatory. It seemed like Kushner was just showing off his extensive knowledge of intricate language. None of the characters were particularly likable so I wasn't really compelled to find out what happened to them. Perhaps I am just not sophisticated enough (although I majored in Theater and have read and attended many plays) to appreciate what Kushner was trying to say; I found this play pretentious, depressing and tedious."
3,O.K. Just Not My Cup of Tea,"I had to read it for a class. It was O.K. At times it grabbed my interest more than I thought it would. It just wasn't the type of literature that I really enjoy and I found the writing hard to follow sometimes in the first act -- it was an intentional choice by the author to make a point, but still hard to follow. Perhaps if I had heard it spoken, since this is a play, it would have made more sense. While it did have many underlying themes I prefer something a little less pendantic.Also, it was written before 9/11 so the author chose to write a long afterward about remarks in the play about how the Taliban would be coming to the U.S. She wrote what she wrote. I didn't think she needed to write an explanation/politically correct apology."
4,Cute and smart but narrow,"I really liked the look and height of these shoes, but after a little bit of wearing them, the sides start to rub painfully against my little toes. I guess they were made for narrow feet. I may have to use a shoe stretcher to help a bit."
4,Refreshing and Practical Spiritual Devotional,"I have read many devotionals that are geared toward moms and not one has exhibited the practicality and truth that this one does. In simple terms and examples that a busy mom can relate to. This book seeks to encourage and remind us that life happens one day at a time and everyday is a different circumstance each with its own needs.At the end of each daily devotional the book offers insight on:-what we can do to better our goals as mothers-how to apply this-several scripture references that support the lecture read.I am a single mom of two. An 11 mth old and a 5 year old. The phrase ""Time is of the essence."" never really had so much meaning until now.This book is a quick great way to end my night and prepare my heart to open up in prayer before closing the chapter of my day.Cute little book!!!You can also use all the insight after each devotional to write a bible study or class if you wanted to.Enjoy :)"
3,It works and is easy to follow,"No program is ever going to suddenly give you knowlege... Regardless of what program you pick you are going to have to practice practice practice. This program is a little dated and looks like it was designed for the Win 95 platform. Still though it gets the job done and I largly enjoy it. Even though it is geared towards kids, as an adult, I followed allong nicely."
4,"Obvious clones of New Edition, but still a pretty good album","Though this group had a couple of Top 10 R&B hits with this 1987 album, they remain pretty well locked in obscurity. Though it does seem pretty obvious from listening to this that they were trying to jump on the New Edition bandwagon, this album does have some great songs on it. One of their hits from it is the gorgeous ballad ""Come Over"", which is uncommonly well-crafted for their general style, and the opener, ""Smokin'"" is a catchy, delightfully playful song (though it unfortunately does contain a deliberately favorable metaphoric reference to a cigarette). Overall, if you're an NE fan, you may want to check this out."
4,Quality product,"This is a simple suicide knob, but it's very well constructed and is a boon to boaters when maneuvering in tight quarters."
1,"Don't waste your money,but",another way to repell the gopher is to kill it with the poison from your local store.
1,Not This,"The only treatment that works is to kill what the moles eat.Put down something to kill insect larvae, grub-ex or somthing like that.That works."
5,Uncle Greg Loved it!,"My Uncle Greg and Aunt Linda had more moles than you could shake a stick at. After I purchased them two molechasers, the moles all but vanished. They had tried everything. Aunt Linda was going crazy sprinkling hot sauce on the lawn and driving my uncle insane. Now they are both relaxing in there mole free lawn!! Thank you so much for a wonderful product!"
1,Does NOT work for my gopher,My gopher loves the sound. It seems its activity has increased ever since I placed this product. Find new holes in the very close vicinity of this product every morning. I am considering to use traps.
1,Not working so far!,"I planted two of these ""mole chasers"", both directly in the path that the varmit has been using between my front yard and my back. I have to collapse the tunnel between the two molechasers almost every day and his underground network is starting to approach the size of the New York subway system. I fear I may need to take more drastic measures! Good Bye Mole!"
1,Bogus lawn dart,"Gophers have been ravaging my lawn. I bought the sonic molechaser as a last resort item since poison, traps, flooding, road flares, gopher gassers etc. have done nothing to eliminate the rodents. Two days after inserting the stake into the affected area, the gophers were back enjoying their daily diet of fescue. Perhaps my soil is affecting the unit's effectiveness as I don't have clay in my region - it's all aggregate. Next technique - explosives."
1,More of a homing beacon than a repellent.,"After having been in place for a couple of months, the moles were literally burrowing within 2 feet of the device.I had to double check to see if it was still producing the noise; it was.Totally ineffective device (at least in the sandy soil of Florida)."
3,P7900,This mole chaser appears to have a lower output amplitude compared to the lesser expensive P7901 model that I already owned. I have not used it long enough to be certain but the lower volume level appears to make it less effective. I would recommend the less expensive P7901 which does a pretty good job.
3,Don't work as good as they used to,"I have used this type of mole chaser for years and been very happy with the results. Although the new ones are the same brand and model, they don't seem to work as well as the older ones. The sound they emit is not quite the same as the older model and I don't think it penetrates the ground as well. In any event, they are not controlling our moles. This is probably a case of the company deciding to improve on a product and they should have left it alone."
1,Don't waste your money!!,I had bought a similar product before and was pleased with it but this one absolutely does not work. We still have moles.
2,Don't know if it would work,"IT IS A HOLLOW TUBE, SO NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BE POUNDED INTO GROUND. OUR GROUND IS VERY HARD."
4,Maintaining a mole free lawn - but I may be going overboard,"The only reason I didn't give the Molechaser a 5 was the questionable range guidelines. It may be that it's hard to determine the range in my soil conditions, but once I installed 2 more early last summer for a total of 4 covering approx 5000 non contiguious sq ft, they have left the protected areas alone. Due to some activity in my neighbors yard, I made some adjustments to the layout this spring, and noted that my perimiter was tested once again. I'm going overkill and picking up another one to confidently protect my entire lot (1/2 acre) for a mole free summer."
4,Nearly Right,"The author gives a great explanation of the rope and cordage materials available, how to choose them for a particular application, and how to care for them. Most importantly, he tells you clearly when different sorts of rope should no longer be used for critical applications. This is wonderful, necessary information. He chooses the knots he presents very well indeed. He gives the practical knots everyone will want to use, and he tells succinctly what the proper use of each one is---as well as the limitations of its use. All this is great. I find that his instructions for tying the knots is sometimes too terse. The pictures are good enough, but just good enough. To get the full five stars, he would have to improve the tying instructions and give greater elaboration on how to test each particular knot before putting it in service. It's a great book. There's no reason it couldn't have been even better."
5,"If you are level with the dart board, this game is a lot of fun","Realizing that most of us don't always read the entire review on here(for whatever reason), I thought I'd put the MOST important information in the title. When you go to mount this toy to the wall, make sure to out the board at the level of the child's head. When the child throws the dart, it will have the best chance to stick to the dart board if mounted this way. If you plan on playing with your child, make sure your head is also level with the board if you want any chance of having your darts stick to the board. For me, this means kneeling on the ground.This game is a lot of fun. My 5, 7, and 9 year old boys (along with 35 year old hubby) enjoy this game a lot.If you buy it, I hope it brings you hours of fun, as well :)~happy mommy"
4,Boys Blast of Fun...,My Grandsons enjoyed this dart game very much.I enjoyed giving it to them because the darts werenot sharp points for them to hurt themselves with.It really is fun.
4,Great purchase!,"The magnetic board and darts are fabulous and the darts stick quite well -- they do not fall off at all! Very good quality, flat-faced (no metal details like a cork board) and colorful. The whole family enjoys this game!"
4,A Safe Dartboard,"The magnets stick very well to this dartboard. My children (ranging in age from 3 to 9) all enjoy trying to get a bull's eye. Once the older ones get the hang of keeping score, it will be a great toy to help them practice their math skills."
3,How can I purchase extra darts?,"I bought this for my grandson's birthday and purportedly it came with 6 darts. Well as of today there are only 5. One of the reviewers mentioned they purchased a couple extra sets of darts, and I'm there! I'm ready to purchase them! But I can't find the extra sets on Amazon."
5,Fun Without the Holes,The magnets are great. Much better than what I've seen in other magnetic dart boards. My son loves it! It's nice to not have to worry about him hurting himself or damaging the walls.
4,Possible safety hazard!!!!,"I purchased one of these Marky Sparky Doinkit Dart Boards for our games room. It arrived quickly, looks nice, and is fun to play with. The trouble is that the metal face plate separated from the plastic back and sliced a little boys nose before it hit the floor. So beware, the metal face plate may not be securily fastened to the back. Pulling the darts off the board may result in injuries. I am going to drill a hole through the face plate and back then use a nut, bolt, and washer to make sure the two pieces stay together.UPDATE:I called the factory yesterday and told them what had happened. They are aware that the older boards will do that and have designed a new board. They are sending me a new board."
4,Fun toy for adults and kids,Doink-it darts is a fun toy of good quality. The magnets are powerful and they stick each time it's used. Good price for the money.
5,High-end quality,"This is a vast improvement over other child-safe dart games, and the board's 3-D graphics were so convincing I had to touch it to realize it was all a flat, smooth surface.The darts really are very well weighted, and throw true. Board requires some consideration on its mounting location: the darts are heavy, and will put small dents in drywall."
3,Price outweighs value,"The magnetic quality of the darts is no better or worse than other magnetic dart boards despite claims to the contrary.The body of the dart is a cheap molded trumpet shaped plastic that doesn't resemble a ""dart"" with a straight body and fins. They do not fly true and are not aerodynamic. It is always a guess as to where they will go. They are difficult to grasp for a decent throw.The package is probably ok for little kids who really aren't concerned with accuracy but even then it is vastly overpriced for the value. I previously owned one of the roll-up type magnetic dart board which was much less expensive and provided a better and more realistic experience."
2,Loud Noises!@#!@#,"The reason this thing sticks so much better than the other felt dart games is because of the hard surface. Because of this, this thing is LOUDDDDDDDDD!!! I bought this for my office and can't use it at all.I bought a cheaper $[...] felt dart board and use these magnets on that surface instead. I recommend that approach in an office environment. Also, the cheap felt dart board has a darts game side and a playing cards (for poker, blackjack ,etc) game side - so there are more possibilities there."
4,"Overall, a good product","This was a fun toy, for all who played (kids and adults)... The board was sturdy, the darts stuck well to the board. The only downside was the kids started to pull apart the handle of the dart (its a mesh material), which affected the aerodynamics of the darts. Also, it only came with 6 darts, I wish it came with some extra. I would definitely recommend though if you're looking for a quality magnetic dart board."
5,The Statue Liberty,"I am wondering. Does this show (The statue Liberty - CD) have closed capition? I am hard of hearing.Thanks,Tammy Johnson"
4,Statue of Liberty,"The Story of the statue's origin and creation in France and subsequent installation in America. David McCullough guides this historical drama, Jeremy Irons leads the readings in role of sculptor Frederic Aguste bartholdi. The Promise: The question of liberty itself and the significance of the statue to American life, includes NY governor Cuomo, former congresswoman Barbara Jordan, musician Ray Charles and MORE! Charlie Chaplin, Jimmy Stewart, Jose Ferrer and Charlton Heston are all seen in Hollywood encounters with Liberty."
5,The Buetiful paintings,This is the story of little boy of sabana grande. I liked the pantings alot.They were very beutiful and warm. The people in the story liked the paintings too. I also liked the work he put into it too. He worked hard too make the paint and then do the paintings.Then the people asked him if he coud paint for him to and so he did.THE END
3,Fascinating Research,"Not as lively as 'The King Must Die' but interesting and full of intriguing lesser known facts for all that.I can't see why Theseus is so attracted by a woman who's a mannish alter-ego, but that's a matter of taste, I suppose. Poor old Phaedra doesn't get a look in with either Theseus or his goody goody son. After Theseus tops her, it's a matter of time just how long he can stand living with himself.Well worth reading for that great background research alone."
3,another in her classical series,"Renault is well-known for her series of books about the classical Greek world and mythology. Read in order the books are interesting and flow well, though at times a bit too slowly and too detailed for thorough enjoyment. In comparison to the other books in this series, this is about average quality."
1,dont waste your time,"This book is, for the most part, difficult to hang on to. It rambles on about nothing, and is hard to pull together. The actions scenes might be ok if he didnt stop to talk about everything for 5 pages. How can a greek myth be written by a person named Mary Renualt, anyway?"
1,Don't read this book,"I had a choise of over 200 books to read for my Latin class, and I choose this one. The summary on the back of the book intrigued me. The title also caught my attention. My teacher had even suggested Mary Renault as a good author to choose. However, I found this book to read slower than an instruction manual for a do-it-yourself television kit. The punctuation is confusing as well as the word usage. Most of the time, I hadn't the foggiest idea what the heck was going on. It held my attention, but to what I could not figure out. Personally, I would rather read an instruction manual for a do-it-yourself teleision kit... or even a dictionary. I suggest you do the same."
1,i really didn't like this book,"this book was awful! it was really boring, and, the author could have done better"
4,perfectimage@monad.net,"I gave this book 4 stars only because I'm in Middle School and didn't understand some of the parts in it. It was also kind of hard to remember who was who when they were in few parts of the book. I think I'll read it again when I'm older. I didn't really get the plot either. I suggest that older people read this and not younger kids mostly because of the adult content in it. ""The Bull From Sea"" is a really good book. It gets you thinking."
5,peaceful resolutions,"In a world where everyone seems to be interested in what is wrong Dr. Rothblatt has offered a clear path to how we can make things right. The Two Star plan is the kind of out-of-the-box solution that our foriegn policy needs to adopt. This is more than a book, it is the kind of profession of justice that John Rawls would have loved to lived to see. The points are clear and the idea is classically American. Its a shame this was not written fifty years ago the whole world would be a much more peaceful place with American stability in the continental crossroads without forceful entry like we now have in Iraq."
2,Is She Kidding?,"What can this woman's voter registration be, Loony Party? Let's annex Pluto while we're at it! It would bring peace and prosperity and nation-building to millions of impoverished Plutonians, not to mention to Ms. Rothblatt herself. Two stars for Nuttiness."
2,Not the Jari I remember,I used to do a lot of Jaris' workouts and decided to try this one but wish I hadn't. The routine just doesn't measure up to her prior DVDs' and the guy who does the gorilla walk should be embarrassed to present such a dumb exercise. I won't be buying any more Jari Love DVDs'. The Gilad step workout is much better.
4,A lot bigger then I expected,"Great toy, My 5 yr old loved it and still plays with it.... He even puts a blanket on the top and uses it as his hide out!"
1,No Tattoo for you Popeye,"The labelling wasn't clear on the product listing on Amazon, so I got a product I could not use. You can't play it on equipment in the United States, so the whole thing was just a waste. Caveat Emptor. Why would you even ship it to someone in the USA?"
2,Aaaagghhhhh!!!,"woeful storyline, bad writing, character building and acting. Nothing against the seller but the movie below par."
1,Tatoo,"I was very disapointed in this product. I now have a movie I can't watch and no way to return it. When ordering, I was'nt clear about what they ment about the format. I'm not an expert!. I just wanted the movie for a gift. I won't ever purchase another dvd from this company. I thought all dvd players were the same, except for blue-ray. I don't blame Amazon,but I feel I threw away money"
1,Send me ny stuff!!!!!!!!,"I have not received this item yet, UPS delivered it to the wrong address and I contacted them any they said they were contacting you.Teri Collier"
3,interesting,"This book is certainly fact-filled, and I did learn a lot about this historically significant arm of the Kriegsmarine. However, I agree with the shortcomings mentioned by other reviewers. A lack of detailed maps of critical patrol areas and virtually no mention of the unique individuals who fought them are serious drawbacks. It should also be mentioned that Britain's Coastal Forces were seriously unprepared for the E-boat's superiority in a gunfight with British MTBs(Moter Torpedo Boats).There were so few MGBs(Motor Gun Boats)available to escort MTBs that many MTBs had their torpedo tubes removed and extra guns added."
3,E-boats 1939-45,"Follow the line of this type of edition, this book is a tenuous coverage about the topic, but offer a generic vision and description of main data and facts, a good choice to a fast consultation."
5,Good source of info.,This is a good book for anyone interested in these boats. Good pictures and background info for anyone modeling one of the exceptional boats.
3,Derleth's love for material and HPL saves book.,"When it came to soul chilling tales of Dark Fantasy August Derleth could not come anywhere close to H.P. Lovecraft, the writer Derleth saved from vanishing into pulp literary history. But Derleth's love for the stories and mythos that Lovecraft created in his short life clearly shows in this collection of overly similiar short stories (they all tell the tale of someone moving into an old, isolated house and coming under the influence of the Elder Gods) and it is this love that makes the book a delight to read. It will satisfy the itch for Lovecraft inspired fiction but won't leave a lasting impression. Recommended for die hards only."
3,"Lovecraft is THE Cthulhu writer, others fall short of him.","This is a really good book. All the stories are terrific. However, remember, Derleth is only a substitue for his master, H.P. Lovecraft."
3,Why you need to read this review,"Like the series, this film was made by a group of actor friends who decided to make a film. Is it funny? It's Amy Sedaris, mofo, so yeah, it's hilarious. It's also very uneven. Watch the film a second time with the Sedaris/Dinello/Colbert commentary on. It's not every day you get to hear filmmakers cheerfully point out their (many) mis-steps and mistakes. (One does long for Colbert to shut his yap hole, however. Christ!)"
1,Buyer Beware-This is not like the tv series,"I should start out by saying I am a huge fan of the TV series. So when I heard about the movie I was particularly excited. So excited in fact, I bought the DVD outright before I even watched the movie. A decision I would come to regret.While the movie had a few funny moments (or rather, a couple) I hardly laughed through any of the movie. The jokes seemed to just completely fall flat. It also didn't help that some key characters were recast for the movie, further taking away from the experience. With such a talented cast, including some pretty big guest stars, I guess I just expected more out of the movie.Do yourself a favor, stick with the TV series only. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off take this movie to my local Mega Media Xchange."
2,Not as good as the series.,"I bought this thinking it would be as good as the series and I was wrong. I LOVE the humor in the series, even though it can be a bit offensive (like Family Guy). I only laughed a couple of times at the movie and it was only at Gerry...noone else was really all that funny. Disappointing."
3,Great movie/bad dvd,If you enjoy the TV show you will love the movie.The only problem I had with it was the actual DVD is warped. I returned it once and they sent me a new DVD and the second DVD is warped as well.
2,What happened?,"Strangers with Candy is a cult classic, however the movie is ridiculous. A better idea would be to stick with the tv series dvds and avoid this movie. I don't remember laughing once during this whole movie, the jokes were so obvious and drawn out. Amy Sedaris wasn't enough to carry this whole movie, I wouldn't reccommend this movie to my worst enemy."
3,better for what it is,please let know that this is a good movie but far from the shows humor it did good on its basic laughter approval it was suppost to come out october 21 2005 now came out in theaters summer 2006 instead warner independant sold out out so now sundance studio thinkfilm did it it went with the same title as the show guest apperances phillip seymour hoffman mathew broderick sara jessica parker allison janney ian holm and dan hedaya showed in the sundance film festival in january 2005 the story is basically just about the beginning of the story
3,VERY FUNNY FIRST HALF LOSES STEAM THROUGH THE SECOND HALF,"I never really watched the TV series, but my wife enjoyed it. I watched this movie with her and I must admit, it was hard not to laugh. The film did seem to cool down a bit in the secand half,but it was pretty funny overall."
5,Jerri Blank,"Out of prison & unleashed on Flatpoint once again, for the first time. A prequel to the best politically incorrect TV comedy perhaps ever (at least besides All In the Family). Laughs galore as Jerri tries to adjust to life outside the harsh penal system. It is not easy, especially for everyone inside Jerri's ""chow zone"". You may take a beating or perhaps loose a finger, but Jerri is loyal to her bitches. If anyone messes with her friends, she'll stick 'em with a shive in the showers. Violent slapstick, vulgar sexual content and other delights await."
2,Not what we had hoped for...,"We are HUGE Strangers With Candy Fans, and couldn't wait for the release of the DVD as the movie was not shown in theaters in our area. The movie didn't have the same flair or the same feel of the original TV series on Comedy Central and we were really disappointed. We have the complete series on DVD (which by the way is a MUST HAVE) and are glad that we have the film to add to the collection, but haven't watched it since we first viewed it. Sad to say that the SWC gang lost their touch in writing their offbeat un-PC themes, and it was a shame of awesome comedic talent. BUY THE SERIES INSTEAD...THATS WORTH THE MONEY and WORTH WATCHING AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!"
1,Rent It!,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I enjoyed the series, and probably saw most of the episodes, but this wasn't worth the time."
3,wait to see it on tv,please let know that this is a good movie but far from the shows humor it did good on its basic laughter approval it was suppost to come out october 21 2005 now came out in theaters summer 2006 instead warner independant sold out out so now sundance studio thinkfilm did it it went with the same title as the show guest apperances phillip seymour hoffman mathew broderick sara jessica parker allison janney ian holm and dan hedaya showed in the sundance film festival in january 2005 the story is basically just about the beginning of the story
2,STARTS OFF WELL AND SINKS,"I liked the idea. I liked the begining. But somewhere in the first third of the film, it degenerated into a bad 1950's situation comedy that was stale on 1950's TV.Amy Sedaris plays a woman out of prison, and decides to resume her high school education, Even though she's into her 40's the school board allows her to deal with the teen age students.The principal has a problem with the school board and decides the only way out of it is to ""win the High School Science Fair"". Doesn't this sound original? Will Amy help? Gawd, the suspense...And Amy Sedaris does a hideous impersonation of Jerry Lewis. You know, socially awkward enough to gain our sympathy, but going on to do stupid idiotic things to make us disgusted.Better writing and acting might have help, as well as a different perspective.Nice try."
2,idiotic!!!,"I just saw this excursion into pure idiocy and couldn't help wanting to slap myself for wasting $9.00 on the ticket. This is a one-joke wonder that quickly runs out of steam. Maybe it worked better as a half-hour sitcom, but it completely ran out of steam on the big screen. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for exactly two funny moments in the entire film. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage!"
1,Stupide à souhait!!!,"C'est le film le plus stupide que j'ai vu les 10 dernières années. Mal joué, un scénario idiot, une mise en scène plate et insignifiante. Je me demande pourquoi existe ce genre de cinéma??? Peut-tre pour les inconditionnés de la télévision!!! Quant à moi, j'avoue l'avoir vu à cause de Justin Theroux, qui malheureusement fait une apparition express."
1,A complete waste of time,"As a person that does not watch television, we rented this based on a few comments on the web. It was horrible. It is NOT funny. The plot is the same old ""unusual person goes back to high school"" drivel we've been fed for decades. The jokes are all based on bad slapstick or scatological comments. This movie is simply not funny and quite boring. I don't know what else to say. Oh yes, the acting is atrocious. The main character is so overplayed (and badly) that it becomes nauseating at times. Stay away from this bomb! Just shows you how far you can push garbage if you have some money behind it."
4,LOVE this movie,"Ok, people say this movie isn't as good as the original show which I think is crap because this movie is awesome. It's JUST like the TV show (except that they must've had better quality cameras to film with so the picture is clearer), it's the same writers, same actors, and same twisted sense of humor. Best part? There is a commentary on the dvd with Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello, and Stephen Colbert. WIN!"
5,Never Saw the Show...Loved the Movie,"Most of the reviews here seem to be from dissapointed fans of the show, which may be understandable. But, having never seen the show, all of the laughs were fresh for me and I loved every second of it. I was almost stunned at just how funny the movie was! Amy Sedaris is hands-down spectacular and the star-power cameo actors weren't so bad themselves. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen the show. It may be a better movie if you haven't."
1,Minus 5! How Does This @%&* Get Made?????,"500 TV channels, nothing on! I decided to give this pile of excretement a chance. I lasted 15 minutes, wanted to stick a water pick into my ear to clean out of my brain what I had just seen. Luckily in time, memory fades!Can you imagine foreigners watching this ""thing""? No wonder we're hated!What a waste of millions of dollars, what a waste of everything. Great scipts laying around that don't get produced, but dreck like this does. Obviously everyone involved was under the influence of controlled substances if they think anything in this movie was funny. You know the same phenomenon that happens with Will Farrel movies.I don't know what an Amy Sedarkis is or IF she's supposed to be funny. Walking around with an over-the-top expression on your face like you've been constipated for the last 6 months is NOT funny. From now on wherever I see her name, RUN!!!!!!!"
2,Funny for awhile....,"Thought this would be better....while it's funny for a while, the acting and movie get boring. I really did not like it. This video ended up in a garage sale the next summer."
4,Excellent product,"I recently purchased the Miele Calisto vacuum. I have a very thick rug and could never find a vacuum that worked so well. I also have 3 cats, 2 of which are long haired. This vacuum does a fantastic job in getting the cat hair out of the deep pile of the rug. It has unbelievable suction.The only thing I really am having a little trouble with is the weight of the powerhead. I had shoulder surgery a few years ago and it really is a little difficult for me to handle. It's very heavy. Also, the power cord is way too short. It could use at least another 5 to 10 feet of length. I have to keep changing outlets numerous times to get my entire house vacuumed and I don't have an especially large house. It's about 1500 sqare ft.Other than the few complaints I think it is well worth the money and would recommend buying it."
4,A Worthy Purchase,"I recently acquired a painting with a frame around it that wasnice, but really showed its age. I wanted to find out if the frame hadany value and was worth restoring or if I should just reframe the painting. I purchased Eli Wilner's ""Antique American Frame Identification and Price Guide,"" which was a wealth of information, and came to the conclusion that this frame might even be more value than the painting! This book is a must have for anyone interested in learning about frames."
4,Antique American Frames,Great information with lots of detailed pictures. A must if you want to learn the details and values of antique American frames.
3,"generally poor visuals, good written information","Low quality frontal drawings are too small and in not-enough detail; the reader gets no idea of depth, detail, and dimensions of molding. The view of the Sully frame, for example, would be of little use in identifying a Sully frame on sight. Eye-opening prices and thoughtful, well-written text."
1,The 6 things WRONG with this watercolor set,1. The paints do not mix as true colors; no color learning for your child. Red and blue make mud; yellow and blue make mud; yellow and red make mud. This is because all the colors are diluted with white and other pigments and do not mix true. A cheap alternative to real paints.2. The pans of paint are very shallow and get used up in the first use. Another super cheap trick. Your kids will get maybe 3 paintings out of this set.3. Made in China; says non-toxic but what does that really mean in China these days?4. Overpriced at any price.5. Huge waste of plastic and our international shipping lanes.6. I expect more from Melissa and Doug. Cheapens their product line.
2,They're.......okay,"They look cool, the color wells are large and the color is fine. But they're not hard watercolors, they're more gel-like. They lasted two sessions with my two year olds. If you hover while your kids paint they might work for you. If, like me, you let your kids go crazy, they don't last long enough to be any kind of value, even at the extremely reduced price I paid. Go with the Crayola ones."
2,disappointing,"Not enouch paint. My daugther blew thru this in one sitting. The set said Jumbo, but very little actual paint.Disappointing from M"
1,"DON""T waste your time and money","I wish I had read the previous review on this product first. The paints colors are light hues at best. Yes, the case in which the paints come in is very sturdy. There is barely enough paint here for 1 paint session. My baby girl loves to paint so this product is not really worth the money.We also tried:Melissa & Doug Finger Paint Set 4pcDon't bother with this one either."
4,Love the paint,We bought the paint for my 4 year old daughter and she loves painting with it. She has used it many times.
1,Not sure why they still sell them!,"The colors are so bad, it's unbelievable. The petty case is the only nice thing about them.They are used up in one session, are watery and hard to use.I wonder why Melissa and Doug hasn't come up with a different recipe to make their colors richer yet!Maybe they haven't heard that there are watercolors out there that actually work!I'm so disappointed...don't waste your money on this product.I grew up in Germany and am used to watercolors from Pelikan ( they can be found at amazon). Those are by far the best colors I've ever used. They last long and are super rich. I used them even in art class all the way up to my teen years. Super great product! A bit more expensive I think $12.- for a set of 12 colors) but it comes with a tube of white, so you can mix pastels yourself which teaches about colors and shades etc. I highly recommend it!"
5,Lots of Paint!,These Melissa and Doug paints are wonderful! Our 4 year old grandson is forever running out of paints for his art projects and these have at least four times more paint then the little watercolor sets that most of us purchase for our kids.The colors in the paint set are nice and bright and the size makes it great for smaller hands.
1,Very little paint,"Paint is fine, not super vibrant, but fun colors...my daughter was excited. However, after a few pictures most colors were used up..I've never seen paint disappear so fast. We had a German brand water color set that lasted more than a year..this lasted a few days. Disappointing."
4,"Great, but runs out fast.","The Melissa and Doug Watercolor Set is a set of colors that are a little pale. If you have artwork with a lot of bright colors in it, then this is the set for you.If you don't want to get two sets, you can paint a few layers to get it to the pigment you want. Painting a lot will make the colors run down quickly. Those reasons are why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Those problems are very minor though. I like the brush, and how it's easy to swirl your brush around in the colors because they're very large. The Crayola brush is not so easy to use because the brush moves around too much when you're painting. The plastic case is great and sturdy.You can go with Crayola if you want more pigment and color, or you could go with this set with a lot of pale colors, if you like to add tints to your artwork.I know most of the reviews have gave this set a low rating, but I absolutely love this set, and that's why I gave it a 4."
2,Not Long Lasting,"The paint is relatively soft and doesn't take much water to get them ready to use. Unfortunately, my daughter went through almost the whole tray of colors in one sitting. Other watercolors I have purchased lasted a long time through many uses. I would not purchase again."
2,Not as good as Crayola paints,"I love Doug and Melissa toys but the paints really aren't as good as the Crayola watercolors I bought at Target. The colors are not as saturated, and my daughter really didn't enjoy painting with them. No amount of water or pressure or amount of paint on the brush changed the fact that the colors are just really weak. I hope we'll use them up someday, but I went out and bought Crayola watercolors again."
5,Spectre Chrome Split Loom,"High quality product and arrived promptly. Been using these for many years to dress up hoses, cables, and electric wires on my cruiser motorcycles. Good product."
5,40 year old friend,"I purchased A Guide to Reading and Writing Japanese in 1965. And it has been a good companion for nearly 40 years.The front and back covers are missing as well as the Title page and pages 16-17 that illustrate the first nine kanji.During my two years in Japan I purchased the 8 volumes of theNaganuma textbooks (24 books), the Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary and numerous other books. In addition, Iearned 12 college credits through the University of MarylandFar East Extension, and studied calligraphy under a retired Japanese school teacher.Yet, that little guide to reading and writing Japanese became myfavorite book. I learned hiragana and katakana in one weekwhile learning to pronouce all of the syllabic sounds in the Japanese language. As a part time student I learned 400 to 500kanji.It is a great book!"
4,Not so much,I'm not sure what I was expecting but this didn't get it. It is more about writing ( copying) some words but not speaking Japanese.
1,more than 20 years old,"This book is good but it is more than 20 years old. The kanji are listed according to the official specifications of the Japanese Government of 1946. It has, since then, been updated in 1981 and the new list of kanji required in everyday life now contains 1945 caracters. The content is good but it is definitely antiquated."
4,"A handy companion, but slightly outdated","A Guide to Reading and Writing Japanese is an extremely handy Kanji dictionary, referance and drawing guide to the characters. It also includes Kana and Hiragana in the back of it, as well as there stroke orders. This is the second revised edition 1961, the book says it can take you to a 6th grade level of writing if you learn all that is in it, however standards have slightly changed... The amount of characters learned per grade, and the characters learned in each grade has somewhat changed from the publication of this book. For instance one can even tell its age looking at the first page where it lists Shi as Four, this was changed well over two decades ago because Shi also means death and makes many Japanese feel uncomfortable using it.This is a great book, but I suggest the third revised edition (2003) as its more up to modern standards, not that this edition is bad in any way, you just might find yourself using some outdated characters here and there."
5,A good approach to classic topics,"A very well written text. A good integration of analytical and numerical methods. Each chapter is designed toward being able to understand a particular class of problems. This approach sets this book aside from the traditional ""Advanced EGR Mathematics"" texts. That is, if your looking for a book of examples (""long chapters"") then buy one of the traditional texts. If your looking to learn mathematics, buy this one."
3,Amazons Just Wanna Have Fun,"The animation is ok. The story is hit-and-miss.The voice acting is not great but pretty good. The jokes are phoned in a mile away. The Amazons are nothing then female versions of the male counterparts. The Villans are forgettable and also phoned in a mile away. This video is more of a ""rent me"" then a ""buy me"" I give this tape a 6 out of 10."
2,not very helpful,"It covers the first two or three weeks of a good piano tutorial, and even then skips the more difficult parts. Upon completion, you won't be able to play any kind of sheet music, other than real simple monophonic songs, like ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" or ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"". The reality is that it helps you to memorize a number of songs, as opposed to learn how to read music and play piano. The play along feature is poorly designed. If you make any mistake it gets confused and you have to start over."
3,It is not as easy and actual as I thought.,"The order processing was all-right, but Piano Suite Premier is not as innovated and modern as I thought. I was expecting something more actual. I have a couple of issues also when setting it up on Windows 7 (guest because of the same reason). I think I will end up buying something different."
2,Difficult to set up and not great software,"[-- SETUP PROBLEMS --]I've tried to set this program up using a midi cable and two or three different computers. It was difficult to get the software to recognize the attached keyboard, even though it is midi compatible.[-- SOFTWARE IS LAME --]There are included games which have nothing to do with music or reading music. We weren't even sure what the games were for.[-- MUSICAL GUIDANCE --]The musical guidance is the reason we bought the software and it just didn't exist. We simply wanted something that helped us progress from one note and one key to many notes in many keys and it just didn't have anything like this. It just set up the songs and had you go.[-- INCLUDED MUSIC --]The included songs aren't bad. Lots of public domain stuff so no royalties are involved for software maker."
4,Adventus,"The lessons do very well teaching a middle aged person with zero music experience how to play correctly. The software does not use ASIO driver so there are latency problems no matter what kind of sound card you have. To get around it will cost major bucks. The software is designed for young folks and the graphics can be annoying at times. The disk is copy protected and impossible to duplicate but they will sell you a duplicate for around $10. The printed sheet music is very good and if directions are followed they group formal music at levels to practice with. There are no lyrics on the printed music but are included in the software, there seems to be a lot of copyright disputes taking place."
3,Atleast Satisfying,"I think this Purchase of mine with this CD was fine i guess. The girls voices blended beautifully and gave a sootinhg remody. But I would'nt give it a 4 or 5. The girls voices aren't close to a high quality buy, but its atleast satisfying."
3,Not totally 3B880 Equivalent...,"Bought this as a ""Direct Equivalent"" to my existing 3B880. Though this battery DOES share the same voltage specs, this one arrived probably 25 to 30% LARGER than the battery I was replacing making it all but impossible to install in the place of the existing battery. I ended up damaging the circuit board trying to make this work.Buyer beware."
1,"This is a DVD review, not a review of the movie itself!","This DVD version (Pro-Active Entertainment) is complete garbage. The video transfer is so horrible it looks like it was taken right off a VHS tape. Also, the audio is not in Dolby Surround, but MPEG-2 (which simply means its in two speaker stereo). Avoid this version at all costs. If you want to purchase this movie, buy the version from Lionsgate/Fox which has a superior audio and video transfer. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Eh,I saw this when it was first released on VHS. Somehow it's not nearly as entrancing as I remembered it.
3,"an interesting curio, but badly dated","In all fairness to the director, this was probably excitingly shocking material with an edge back when it was made.In today's vastly superior technical on-location filming world, this all but screams, 'inexpensive college-level video production.'Even that wouldn't be so bad given the wealth of acting talent--'A' actors, several at the early stages of their careers--but the transfer to dvd is simply ABYSMAL."
1,Don't waste your money,"These things don't work. We've had two of them in our yard for 4 months now. In that time, we've killed 6 moles with a trap. Some of the burrows were within 5 feet of the molechasers. They have absolutely no effect on the moles."
2,Nylon is better for higher flying,"We have alot of these in nylon as we use them every year for about six weeks during boy's day celebaration. Nylon flys higher and dries faster. They last for several years as we take them down and put them away until the next year. They do fade after time, especially in the extreme sun, but we have learned to put them in a shadier area with lots of wind to help keep them bright for as long as possible. We end up replacing some every year, but doing it like this it is on a rotation so we never have to replace more than a few every year."
1,"not graceful flight, fades quickly if not brought back in within few weeks",This is not the windsock to leave outside for more than a few weeks.Its profile and flight in the wind is not like a larger windsock - more like a piece of cloth.
1,Dallas buyer,"Nyon windsocks from the House of Rice are cheaply made of the thinnest nyon. Poorly sewn and definitely not worth the price plus shipping. Forget it!Fish Windsocks, set of 5 Koinobori #G633"
4,An insider's view into the early Reagan administration,"Haig was one of the early members of the Reagan administration, but one who did not quite fit in. Haig was not a Reagan ""man,"" rather he came from the Nixon/Ford wing of the GOP establishment. Consequently he was never really on the inside of the decision-making process, and this book illustrates what he thought the results of this. Haig also shares his views of Reagan and his policies. And, he seems to find both wanting. Is this sour grapes? Or is it something else? Well, this book shows that Haig was just working another paradigm entirely. Reagan and he were just not on the same page. Still a great read."
4,A stirring look at three generations of women,"This book is a good read; no more, no less. The story is well written, examining the lives and relationships of three generations of women. Jean, the eldest, is newly widowed, and is just beginning to do all the things she never got to do. Diane, her daughter, is approaching middle age with a less-than-satisfactory marriage, while her 16-year-old daughter Julia is experiencing the fierce pangs of first love. This is a great book for lazy summer days when you're looking for a worthwhile way to spend your time."
3,"3 women, 3 generations, 3 stories... 3 stars","I can't tell you that this is a bad book, but I can tell you that this book is more for women that for men, the book will keep you reading almost all the time the three separate stories:Grandma, is the best of all the stories, but at the end something is missing with her, her story is not complete, but the way she does everything for her family is like a fairy tail, but if she was happy doing that it was perfect.Mother: She was a little bit selfish, but even if she has her own career, she care for her family until her husband doesn't care for her and she look for an FBI agent.Daughter: Is the same story of her grandmother, the only problem is that her mother doesn't like that kind of life (that is the selfish part)."
1,Thumbs down,"Would not play pass the first 5 minutes, it sucked! Seem to be a good movie and was interesting, if only it would play."
3,Not bad at all. A fun movie.,"This movie was a bit of a suprize. I expected a low budget film and was impressed at how well it was made. It was enjoyable and entertaining. I would have to say that it would never be up for an Oscar, but it was fun to watch."
4,The Brotherhood,"The Brotherhood is a good vampire movie, widely appealing to teens and younger adults. Good movie."
2,FRATERNAL INSTINCTS,"Okay, this is obviously a movie meant to turn on the guys...if you're in to hunky young flesh, this one's for you. There's some studly looking dudes in this one. However, other than Nathan Watkins as Chris and Josh Hammond as his buddy, the rest of the acting is junior high level. Especially Bradley Stryker, the hunk who plays head guy Devon. Elizabeth Bruderman is simply awful as the female lead, a whiny voice delivering lines like she was a recorded answering machine voice. Direct David DeCoteau loves the slowmo camera as evidenced by the many shots of the four hunks strutting around campus.The biggest sin, though: it's not the least bit scary..not the least.Rent this one, don't buy it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a ""B"" movie at best! After all the hype from reviews and such I was thoroughly let down. Yes they were vampires. No there wasn't blood and gore. It was supposed to homoerotic. One scene with guys running around in their briefs. I still can't figure that one out.Save your time and money. Rent ""Interview With A Vampire""."
3,Low budget-but not all bad,"I kind of like how the story revolves on the main character getting into this secret society. Although at first he's not feeling the whole idea at first. But given some coersion from his roommate and another person. He decides to attend and the story basically goes from there. I would like to know though why they couldnt afford a real axe. Because i couldnt help but laugh at the dude carrying it the first. It was shown in the movie (i know its not a big deal). But if i notice it, i'm sure others did as well. Overall the characters were decent and it kept me interested for most of the movie. It's not too long around an hour and 20 minutes (give or take a few). I would rent/borrow it first before putting down the cash just so you can know what your getting into. Hopefully the next movie ramps it up a notch."
1,Terrible,Why does anyone think that this book is a good one? I think it is the worst book ever written.
3,Dries Permanent Over Time..,"The Expo Low Odor Chisel Tip Dry Erase Markers, 4 Colored Markers(80174) are bright and easy to see when used on a clean whiteboard. The whiteboard marker markings rub off clean for several days after use, but if left on the board for an extended period of time, they tend to be a little hard to remove with a dry marker eraser, a dry or a damp cloth. It's almost like using a permanent marker.You can easily remove the old dry erase markings without purchasing any special cleaners. Just retrace over the old markings with a whiteboard marker and you'll be able to remove them. You might have to retrace several times over the old markings before you remove them all. This technique also works when whiteboards have been marked with permanent type markers.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
2,One Dry Marker,"I was pleased with everything about the product except the black marker being dry, right out of the box. It would have been too much of a hastle to return the package for one dry marker."
5,What a story!,"I have yet to read the entire book, mainly because my husband will not put it down. As a current wildlife officer, he can both relate to and enjoy Terry's stories. Especially enjoyed : the Chilli story. Not to miss!"
3,I could wish for better writing,"Terry Grosz has some good stories to tell, but I agree with the first reviewer, the book could use some editorial polish. I happen to have some knowledge of CDFG in the 60's and 70's and there are many tales worth telling. If you are interested in wildlife, it would be worth borrowing ""Wildlife Wars"" from the library."
3,Insightful Side of Wildlife Protection,"The book provides some very interesting insight into a side of wildlife and its management not seen by the public. Everything generally looks so peaceful and calm in wildlife areas, but there's poaching, crookedness, thievery and associated danger to animals and game wardens not often heard. These are not simple stories of a warden just ticketing offenders for catching more than their limit. Each chapter is a different story, so one can read whatever story has appeal. This simple organization can wear thin after awhile. It seems like good material for a TV series on his life. Could have used some pictures. Maybe the hardback (if there is one) had them. Often they are omitted from paperbacks."
2,Too much repitition.,"Although the stories themselves are interesting, the repetitive phrases used throughout the book take away from the validity of the stories. The author reminds us in almost every story that he is a very tall 320 pound fellow. We know that you're big . . . get on with the story! He also uses certain phrases too much which also cheapens the book that was not [inexpensive] at all."
4,Good music therapy song resource,"This is a good learning source for music therapy students in particular. The lessons are clear and the sequence of chords are well chosen to make it a good learning tool. There are excellent examples of therapeutic ways to use the songs such as lyric substitution ideas. Songs are organized to give beginning students ideas about what to consider when choosing a song for a therapeutic purpose. It would be improved by having more up to date repertoire and some different guitar strum rhythms, but on the whole, an excellent choice for music therapy students learning to play guitar and sing."
5,Toxic Avenger 7 DVD Set,I purchased this for my nephew and he has been enjoying the DVD's since he's received it. I received it very quickly and it was highly appreciated. Thanks.
4,ANY SUBTITLES?,"Hello! I'm looking after a set like this for a long time, and it looks pretty awesome my question is...Does the dvds have any subtitles on it??Can anybody tell?Thanks!"
2,Fine until you compare,"I've heard many recordings of birds over the years. This one has a bit too much extra noise for my taste. I recently bought a collection from the Lazer Light series (from Amazon) that is the best recording I've ever heard. Very resonable also. 5 CD's for about 15 dollars. One is exclusively titled ""Morning Song Birds"". The complete title is, ""Echos of Nature Vol. 2"". The best. There is no noise (hiss etc) going on, just the sounds. Couldn't be better. So skip ""Birds in a Meadow"",and go for the set or I believe you can get each separately. But why bother because the complete set is only just a bit more!"

4,Ignore Makepeace,"Readers and potential purchasers of 'The Prince of Wales...' should be advised to ignore the 'review' by Nathan Makepeace. One can tell in an instant that Makepeace's florid damnation of the book is made in either jest or abject ignorance. Perhaps when Makepeace's own novel is published - and as a publishing professional myself, I doubt his turgid style would find an audience - perhaps then he will come to understand the harm a mocking review can do to a first-time author.For those yet to read Mallalieu's work - prepare yourself for a fleshy feast of literary originality and dryly sardonic, witty, and intelligent writing. In this age of dumbed-down, easy-to-read pap centred on midddle-class ennui and whingeing - Mallalieu is refreshing to read. I have tried to find out if this talented writer is still 'in the game' - but have had no success. ...As for Nathan Makepeace - well, we're all entitled to our opinions...."
1,Jon - drop me a line,"if you're reading this Jon, e-mail your old hendrefoilan roomie at kristian@tbwaraad.com"
3,Lost in Babble,"It is hard to criticize any book that helps kids pray and be closer to G-d, but this latest from James Riordan (the actual author and not Bill Myers) is awash with bad information.Becka and her Brother Scott have been sent to Louisiana to help a young girl who is getting caught up in voodoo. Armed with prayer and the love of G-d they must go up against some scary forces.When writing a novel, it is important to get your everyday facts correct. James Riordan fails in this. Right from the start with the actions of the airport and pilot we see that the author has not done any non-religious research. We also get a baseball game being played in the heavy rain, a wheat thresher harvesting sugar cane, and absolutely no mention of the kids being away from school back in California. If you want the book to work, you have to get the everyday details right."
2,what happened???????,"forbidden doors just isnt what it used to be. when i read the gaurdian a year ago i thought it was so cool, but now its changed drastically. the curse wasnt suspenceful or scary. the characters come across as wooden and dont act like normal teenagers.not to mention, the climax was entirely copied off the gaurdian!im an advanced reader and i was very disappointed with this book. i used to love reading about ryan and becca and their adventures. but this book reminded me of the goosebumps books i used to like. if you like real thrillers, stay away from this book."
4,A moving account of the anonymous soldier,"Ever wondered what it was that *actually* happened during a war? How the men fighting it out on the front felt? What it was like in those frightening moments just before a life-or-death battle?Steinbeck brings his extraordinary insight and simple, deliberately understated prose style to the field of war reporting. And the result is breathtaking. In this collection of dispatches from the Second World War, Steinbeck looks at one oft-ignored aspect of the war - the man on the field. For whom the war wasn't strategies and troop movements, but a constant struggle to stay alive, preferably unhurt. For whom the war did not mean liberty and freedom as much as the price of potatoes and a job to go home to. It is a considerate look at the common man, who has been thrust into a war not of his own choosing."
3,Patriotism,"After reading many John Steinbeck novels, I decided to read one of his lesser known books. Once there was a war is a fine book, if it was read during or just after WWII. They were all brave, fine young men and women, and the stories are well written and interesting."
4,Great shine,"Pobably the best tire shine on the market...but bottle versus price is far too great for my taste. Great shine, superb product but disappointing lasting and amount versus cost."
3,Too soon to tell,I have not been watching TV when a power outage happened yet so I'm not sure if it keep my TV and DVR running or not.
3,Very erotic at times... kind of [bad] at others,"Darrien Caine is a hottie! Of that there can be no doubt! In this video she's being haunted by some very lust-filled female demons, who consistently have their evil way with her --- which is also the best part of this tape! They also include a sub-plot of her husband --- but it's basically what the fast-forward-search button on your VCR is for. As for Darrien being molested by female demons, my favorite scene was when Jade Duboir takes her from behind with a strap-on! Very nice! Tammy Parks also mixes it up fairly well with Darrien. But that's about it."
2,"Strange, but weak","What a strange film. Not deep and strange, just strange. Something about a guy stuck in a hellish nightmare of a life, possible literally hell and his wife who is visited by an assortment of lusty over sexed ghosts, vampires and succubus. Most of the film was girl on girl soft porn. None of which left me or my girlfriend very steamed up. The best part I found were the extra&#65533;s on the DVD. It was neat seeing people involved having fun."
5,Classic California - Here We Come!,"Pitt's history of the decline of the Californios is an extremely important record of California's past. Few contemporary Californian's are familiar with the rugged settlers who came to this place and created a society of their own. Largely abandoned by the Spanish and then Mexican overseers, robbed by the invading Americanos, the Californios left their indelible mark upon us. their influence is subtle now, but we still live in the various ""ranchos"" they founded and ranched. This is a very accessible and well-written piece of scholarship. It is simple enough to qualify as a popular history, well researched enough to be taken seriously in academia."
2,"it was informative but with so many names,a bit confusing",pitt certainly gives us a descriptive account of life in California before the gold rush and after. his referring to so many names and families did make the whole story of the people a little confusing.
3,Post Lukin hangover,"Compared to all the other Mudhoney full length albums, this is their worst. That being stated, it's still not a terrible record... there's actually many bright spots on the record. They're branching out here (lengthening songs, bringing in horns) which is cool to hear, but it is obvious that this is a transitional album for the band. Some tracks really rock, while just as many drag. Dyin for it, Crooked & Wide, & Winner's Circle are particularly offensive to me, just because they are so extremely unremarkable and bland... tedious really.The following album (Under a Billion Suns) is a bit spotty as well, but blows the doors off this record and Lucky Ones competes with their finest work. Since We've Become Translucent captures the band struggling to get their footing.I do give the graphic design of the album five stars. The gatefold of the vinyl edition is super sweet."
5,One of the classics,This book is a must-read for anyone in the teaching profession. It's simple and straightforward to understand.
5,Ideas,"This last review is an illustration of exactly what is wrong with so many educators. Imagine someone so narrow-minded they can't get past the style of writing that they most prefer in order to understand the ideas behind the writing. This book likely did a great deal to counteract the design of curricula based on the kind of traditionalists who would focus exclusively on ""commas in the wrong place"". BTW, there are few if any grammar or mechanical errors in the book, and Tyler certainly didn't do the jacket design."
1,Not Satisfying,I tried this book pan seared with a light cabernet sauce. It was not all that I expected it to be. 2/10 would not eat again.
4,Purchased the book to use as a reference,The book was easy to use for how I needed it. I just wanted to read it quickly for a graduate class in education that I am taking.
3,Cause-and-effect paradoxes as seen from interesting perspective,"This book is a bit of a hard sci-fi with political (and even religious) overtones, but the great thing about this book is that ""our hero"" is not really at the center of things, but is rather giving his perspective of what is going on from just off of center - he is familiar with the people most deeply involved, but does not know everything that is going on for himself.Very nice change from the ""Jack Ryan"" hero who is right in the middle of all the action all the time. Recommended for sci-fi/time travel buffs who like to ponder paradoxes and contemplate the interplay of cause and effect."
4,Difficult book to pigeon hole,"This was a really interesting idea, well told. The ending didn't quite work for me, but until the last 50 or so pages I was hooked. It's a sophisticated treatise about time travel and expectation creating reality. In the year 2020 a huge chronolith appears in Thailand, a man made monolith commemorating a military victory 20 years in the future. Then more and more of them come and the world comes apart, under the stress of these battles yet to come, these victories against armies unknown by a victor we have yet to meet. It was complex and thoughtful with the occasional gleaming sentence. I enjoyed spending time with Scott and his struggles and successes and would def recommend this book. A-"
3,A Fabulous Concept that Sadly Is Never Realized,"The concept of this book is brilliant and utterly original. I love scifi and this is one of the greatest ideas for a book I've come across.With that said, however, I think the followthrough is disappointing. The book never rises to the potential offered by its concept. The story itself is promising in the beginning, but then it sort of evolves into a tepid made-for-TV movie.Sadly, I think this is something of a habit for Robert Charles Wilson. I felt the same about Darwinia -- great concept that never is realized in the telling of the story."
2,Paradoxiically Good and Bad,"I love time travel stories. I wanted to like this one. Its not that the writing or characters were bad. Quite the contrary, I enjoyed much of the story. What left a sour taste in my mouth was the obvious contradiction of the Chronoliths.Chronoliths appear from the future altering our present to lead to a situation that generates the Chronoliths in the future? I don't buy it. Just take a moment and think it through logically. If you are satisified with your present status, do you do something to alter the past? No. If you are not satisfied with your present, then you do something to alter the past, so your present existence will change. You can't alter the past dramatically to keep the same present existence. It's not a paradox, it's nonsense. That's why this book gets only 2 stars."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to read this book as advertised on Amazon, but found it to be lacking in closure. The story dwells too much with the main charater's relationships with his ex-wife and daughter. It boils down to a man's quest for meaning and purpose in his life and relationships with friends. I could criticize furhter but would have to give away the end of the story to warn readers."
3,who the heck is this Kuin anyways?,"and can he keep his damned monuments to himself?Cool idea: Out of nowhere, huge pillar monuments materialize, commemorating military victories that occur in the future.What happens? The main character, Scott, has family issues and the world goes nuts over these damned chronoliths.A brilliant sci-fi concept is diluted by mediocre characters and an unsatisfying ending..."
5,none,"Once again, Wilson has managed to write a book chockful of mystery, suspense, and the alienness of being human. Robert Charles Wilson is one of SF's best writers, and best kept secrets, and with ""Chronoliths"" it's time to let the secret out...Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
3,"a small comeback after ""Darwinia""","As a long time reader of Robert Charles Wilson books, I've come to the conclusion that he's been in a slump lately. Darwinia, his previous novel, had an amazing premise but a muddled plot and little dramatic action on the part of the characters, which propelled earlier works like The Harvest and The Divide. His new one, The Chronoliths, resets the balance somewhat. There is a more active plot, and Wilson is never better than when he wraps his ideas around a ticking time bomb of a story. His Characters are a bit better defined in this one also, I find I enjoy his books more when his settings and characters are contemporary. Since I don't dislike period books per se, I believe that he actually writes stronger when using the here and now as his starting point. You should search around for some of his hard to find earlier stuff, but this book makes a nice addition to his literary niche."
5,An enjoyable time travel story.,"Suddenly, monoliths commemorating the future victory of a great conqueror start appearing around the world, inflicting great damage in the spot they appear. This has profound consequences on the fabric of society, and leads to major changes in life as it has been known.I found the concept behind time-travel to be solid and consistent through the book. Time-travel fits nicely into the story, and is not used just to justify the tale. I started this book a Sunday morning on a business travel, and read it completely in one day in the hotel, so engrossed I was. I found the characters enjoyable, and liked the pace of the book.Since it may serve as a reference, other time-travel books I have enjoyed are: Isaac Asimov's ""Eternity Inc"", Robert Sawyer's ""Flashforward"" and Stephen Baxter's ""The Time Ships""."
2,BORING WITH NO CLIMAX,"THIS BOOK LEFT ME FEELING EMPTY. THE NATURE OF THE CHRONLITHS AND THEIR ORIGIN IS NEVER EXPLAINED. ALL WE ARE TOLD IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY SOMEONE NAMED ""KUIN""- IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED WHO HE IS OR WHY HE SENT THE CHRONOLITHS. I FIND THIS TYPE OF WRITING TO BE EXTREMELY DECEIVING- AN INTERESTING MYSTERY IS PROPOSED, BUT THE AUTHOR THEN MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE MYSTERY OR TIE UP ANY LOOSE ENDS."
2,"Exciting put in scene, disappointing elaboration","The premise of this book is compelling: giant obelisks sent back in time by some future warlord, cities destroyed, the future molding itself acting on the past. It makes you think on a story dealing with time-loops issues, scientific speculation, worldwide geopolitic action... but nothing of this is delivered. The author preferred to focus on the tribulations of a couple of characters, caming back to the main topic now and again and always marginally. The sci-fi content of the story is rather poor, and the ending is frustating at its best: abrupt, anti-climatic, and non-informative.It's disappointing to see how a brilliant premise is wasted in this way. Surely the author could have done much better."
4,"Fascinating look at ""time travel"".","I placed Time Travel in quotes because this book is really not as much about traveling in time as it is about the effects of time travel. Although it lags a bit 3/4 of the way through, overall it is extremely interesting and looks at time travel a whole new way. As always with this author, I was deeply invested in the charactors- and the story.A great read."
3,"An interesting science fiction idea, unattractive characters","In this novel, Wilson describes a remarkable phenomenon: huge, obelisk-like monoliths begin appearing at many sites around the Earth, destroying their immediate points of touchdown. Inscriptions on the monoliths praise the achievements of a future leader named Kuin. Is he sending these colossal objects back in time to influence the course of history? How can present day people stop him? The male narrator, a somewhat degenerate and irresponsible techie, is drawn into the effort to counter the chronoliths. The female scientist leading this campaign comes across as brilliant but weird. Beyond the scientific concept, the most interesting aspect of the story is the semi-religious pro-Kuin social movement that emerges. These true believers oppose those who want to disrupt the arrival of the chronoliths, leading to a violent confrontation in the Dakotas. Great concept, but it's difficult to care about these characters."
2,Huh?,I give this book two stars only because it has a promising premise.Unfortunately the premise is not taken to any real extent. This is one of those stories that you keep reading hoping that it will all work out in the end. In this case it doesn't. Not even close. You are left with a big HUH? and a that's all feeling.There was so much potential and at times I could feel the story moving in that direction only to have it slip away as it became tangible.
2,Not as good as Sphere and Blind Lake,"Halfway through this book, I wanted to quit, but I finished it anyway. It wasn't worth finishing. I just could not get into the very slow relationship stories in this book that are typically an integral part of RCW's books. The main character just wasn't that interesting, nor was his love interest, nor was his boss, or her love interest, or the edgy friend. I really liked both Sphere and Blind Lake, but not this book."
2,Boring,The picture on the front cover and summary on the back made the book seem WAY more interesting then it actually was. This book is not really Sci-fi. It's more like a biography set in the near future.
3,Great Concept Marred by Recycled Plot,"This is the first book by Mr. Wilson that I've read. I found it to be very well crafted, with strong dialogue and strong characterization. The science fiction concepts were intriguing and I enjoyed the entire read.However, once I read Darwinia, I became greatly disappointed with The Chronoliths. The main character in Chronoliths is extremely similar to the main character in Darwinia. Both men are married and have a daughter. Early in the novel, their wives leave them due to their absence. I won't spoil more of Chronoliths, but if you're familiar with Guilford Law from Darwinia, you know Scott Warden from The Chronoliths. This does not apply just to his psychology, but to major plot elements.I still would recommend The Chronoliths because it is indeed quite well written. I find it unfortunate that the main character and his story are not more original, even within the author's own body of work."
3,Not that great,"I kept reading, hoping for something to happen that was interesting. Never really happened. I have enjoyed some of Wilson's other books, but not this one."
3,Good space opera that comes to nothing,"I like Wilson's work and am waiting for Vortex to appear, even if the Kindle price for it (like this one)is pretty outrageous. Not Wilson's fault, I know. He won't even get most of the money---which will only go to temporarily shore up the publisher's collapsing business model.Chronolith is good space opera with more mysticism than science (merely reiterated, obscure theoretical physics) but it all comes to nothing in the end. There's no explanation of the central phenomenon, and barely any of the mystical stuff, which surely could have been expected.The characters are engaging, as you would expect with Wilson, so read it for that. Just know ahead of time that the disappointment of the ending makes the story considerably less than the ""superb"" of one of the major media blurbs."
5,Really liked it,"The description initially seemed pretty hokey to me, and my expectations were low. However, I ended up really liking the book, especially the concepts behind the plot - the physical and social ramifications of the Chronoliths appearing, and how that effected how everything played out.It didn't really progress as I expected either, but the way he wrapped it up was satisfying to me. It seems more and more these days that scifi and fantasy novels are coming in series, so it was nice to discover one I could enjoy without having to follow it up with four sequels."
4,A story out of time!,"The Chronoliths by Robert Charles Wilson was enjoyable. A riviting story that kept you turning the pages, wondering what the mystery of the chronoliths is all about. Some interesting similarities to today's societal issues (crumbling infrastructure, rising political factions etc.) The idea of time loop stories have always been fascinating to me. The ending (which seemed to have been rushed by the editors) was interesting and totally unpredictable with a cogent twist. The characters were quite memorable and had a human face. I would like to see a sequel of this story as there were numerous threads left unanswered, but that depends upon how you look at the plot. The merit of the novel outweighs it's minor flaws (some answers you have to discover for yourself) and I would freely recommend this as a must read."
2,I was very dissapointed,The coming of the Chronoliths and there effect on humanaty is almost a background to the story while the authour spends most of his time discussing the main characters boring family problems.I was hoping for an epic style sci-fi adventure but that is not what we get.
3,could have been a lot better,"Great idea, great structure and decent execution. I applaude the author's creativity and story telling but the story just has no depth or unique styly. It doesn't hit you straight to your core it only scratches the first layer or two of your being. I urge the author to keep writing and exploring with his craft for he is talented. I just don't think this book is quite there. It was a fun read and moved relativley well. I am glad that I read it for the concepts alone. I don't know if I would have finished it if I didn't have so much free time on my hands at the time. It is averagely written and does not give you the hit that one expects when reading an imaginitie story of this type. I probably would give it a 3 and a half. Like I said the ideas are great but the writing is weak. I recomend it to those that are strongly interested in the idea, time travel, time webs, future paradoxes, and the magnetism of life and how it flows."
4,Builds gradually to a mind-bending conclusion,"Took me a few pages, but hooked me in. I found the warped version of cause and effect fun to stretch my mind around."
2,This Story Just Lagged on and on.,"I almost didn't finish this one. It has a great plot - obelisks that pop up everywhere with no explanation, other that they are from the future. In the end the story doesn't hold together. Too much time was spent on people that didn't hold your interest, while the real story was about the these ""chronoliths,"" which I felt was under-discussed or treated in the story. The author tried to make the characters have intensity of emotion, etc., but I felt it was too contrived. It's your gamble on this one. But if your like me and what a fast paced and interesting sci-fi story, skip this one."
2,"Dragged, and then floundered.","I thought the reviews would lead me to a wonderful book. Instead I found one where the premise was just compelling enough to get me to buy it, the intial plot lines enough to get me to read it, and an ending so bland that I skimmed through the end of the book just to finish it and then threw it in the garbage. Nice beginning... fair middle... lousy ending. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy it."
3,"Mediocre, not really a time-travel story","I was attracted to this concept because I'm typically a fan of stories involving time travel of some sort. Unfortunately, there's very little in the way of time travel, just some mysterious monuments that are never really explained--at least not in any satisfying way.Ultimately disappointing."
4,"Intriguing concept, good story, but....","The concept presented here is fresh and fascinating, and the story and characters are nicely presented and not overwrought. The story progresses at a brisk pace, and wastes little time with trivialities, and takes some unpredictable, interesting turns. Thankfully (for this reader), Wilson doesn't go over the top with what could have been a deep foray into the mind-boggling physics/paradoxical side of the subject.Ultimately, though, the ending was a little dissatisfying. I would have liked some of the loose ends wrapped up a little better. I think you'll know what I mean when you get there.... It's a fairly quick, read, though, and well worth your time."
2,disappointing,"This is one of those books you keep reading because you hope that eventually something significant will happen or that some revelation will be made. By the end of the book, you are still waiting. I closed the book and pronounced ""What a disappointment"". You don't know anything more about the chronoliths on page 300 then you did on page 10 and nothing significant is revealed about the conflicts caused by the appearance of the chronoliths. Not a bad read, but no substance."
4,Intriguing sci-fi concept(s) laced with real humanity,"Casual fans of science-fiction will find much to like in Robert Charles Wilson's seminal 2001 work, ""The Chronoliths."" Full of easy to understand 'big idea' sci-fi concepts and a storyline that spans the lifetime of one man, this work has an epic feel to it while remaining throughout a quick and very engaging read."
3,This book won a major award?,"The premise of the Chronoliths is terrific, objects smashing to earth from the future. But they are never really explained,the time paradox is never explored or solved, and while there is some excitement and a lot of demolition, it all goes downhill.The other problem is that the frame of the story is right out of the early 1960's: Not-so-young man's life is falling apart, his wife is divorcing him, etc, etc. There is too much padding for too little real plot, and the book is filled with constant: ""I didn't know then. . ."" Very disappointing."
4,Entertaining and amateur,"This movie is likable and charming. But do not expect high production values! This slight movie does explore aspects of ""pushing the envelope"" with respect to gay/straight relations. Yes, it's true that in large cities like Philadelphia this should not be a big deal. But clearly this relationship still pushes buttons for people -- even those who consider themselves open-minded and liberal. Is it a vanity project for Butch? Of course. But that turns out to be one of the biggest charms of the movie. Think of this as a home movie that you will enjoy watching and talking about with your friends."
5,"An anthem, in the truest sense!","This tune is a club juggernaut. The keyboard work and structure are so strong, you almost forget there's only one sentence of lyrics in the song.A great pickup for DJs or lovers of eurogressive/trance music. The abbreviated versions you find on comps don't do the tune; justice. A good tune like this just envelopes the listener and makes one sad that it has to come to an end."
3,A little disappointed,"I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting when I bought this book. Whatever it was I was a little disappointed. Many of the ideas in the book seem obvious, and not very useful to roleplay veterans. However I did find some use in the random roll chart for traps, gave me a few ideas to use in my campaign, though I'd recomend not leaving traps up to pure chance, take what you like and makes sense and incorporate it. Also as I find myself to be a horrible cartographer I found some map pieces (little bits of a dungeon layout that can be fit together like a puzzle) to be of use when designing dungeons."
3,My comments,"I got this book at the same time as I got the World Builder's Guide Book, and I was expecting lots of good things from this book, but (and not to put it down) it didn't hold my attention as the WBGB did. I've had little use for it as I haven't done much dungeon building, but it does provide some useful info and items such as traps, as well as discussion about why a monster would be down in the dungeon rather than just something for the PCs to kill. My rating is only because it's not been as useful as it could have been for myself. For others, this could be the best darn book, and it probably is."
3,Experience needed,"I found this book helpful, admittedly, I don't use dungeons very often and I didn't use anything the way it was supposed to be used. I would reccomend those wanting to build dungeon crawls using just the table go elsewhere. However, if you take the time to modify the tables to your own needs, it can be valuable. For example, the trap table produces traps that are far too deadly for any gaming group, but it creates very interesting magical items in a pinch. Also, the random dungeon creation table has got to go."
4,Shiney! Quality product. Might have a drawback.,"I purchased this product to help prevent my '06 Ram headlights from ""frosting."" I'm referring to the discoloration in the plastic headlights caused from solar exposure. This product will definitely do that and they look really good. They match my factory chrome perfectly. The only possible drawback is the fit. Once installed, I noticed there is a small gap underneath the leading edge of the bezel where it meets, or attempts to meet, the plastic of the headlight. I can tell this is going to collect bugs, dirt, and small rocks. I only hope that it will wash clean since these bezels are semi-permanent with the 3M tape. Other than that, I really like them."
5,Item.- Es wird morgen,I am glad with the product that I bought throught Amazon and I am glad about service you gave me.Thank youMontse
2,"A so-so record, but all the material is available elsewhere.","""Tonight At Noon"" is an album of leftovers-- half of it is taken from the sessions for ""The Clown"", half of it from the sessions for ""Oh Yeah"". Charles Mingus was batting consistently high during this period, and at least one piece from each of these sessions is essential in his catalog (""Tonight At Noon"" and ""Peggy's Blue Skylight""). The balance of the material is ok, but either a bit uninspired (""Old Blues for Walt's Torin"") or lifeless (""Passions of a Woman Loved"").Having stated that, the deluxe edition reissues of ""The Clown"" and ""Oh Yeah"" include all this material. I'd recommend skipping this one and going with those. My rating reflects the inconsistency of the material and the lack of reasonable value. Still, if you've got those two records, pick this up for 'Tonight' and 'Peggy', you won't regret it."
1,Disappointed...no fragrance,"I have used this product for years, but this particular tube of gel had absolutely no fragrance. I was really disappointed. It was expensive. It pays to check where the product is actually coming from I guess."
1,Not for Cars,"If you have a sedan even on stock height it won't climb.The lower bumper will touch the ramp.MAKE SURE SOMEONE IS WATCHING FROM FRONT OR YOU WILL BREAK THE LOWER BUMPERDon't even attempt to climb the rear axle as you will break your muffler.The company says 6500LBS where as the ramp clearly says 2000LBS/RAMP, so this only makes it a 4000LBS Ramp."
5,my husband loves it,My husband maintains all our vehicles himself. I bought these for him and he immediatly loved them. Years later he still loves them. He's never searched for an upgrade with these. The neighbor even asked him where he got them. Definitly a great buy.Side note: One of the cars we owned once was too low to the ground for these. I can't remember which car.... and the ramps aren't really for cars with low ground clearance.
4,Decent value,These are the typical ramps you find at places like parts stores and harbor freight for example -- they work as designed.
4,"A Great Book, But It Seems A Little Short","I enjoyed it alot even though I could read it twenty times a day because it is so short. It was the first Star Wars book I've read and really got me interested in other novels as well. I would recomend it to people who just started getting into SW, but I guess other SW fans might enjoy it to."
3,"I will escape - Not for Vengeance, For justice.","This is a review of the Scholastic book Star wars Journal - Captive of Evil -by Princess Leia Organa - written by Jude Watson and published July, 1998. Scholastic specializes in books for 9 to 12 year olds, and jude Watson is an experienced author in writing at this level. Watson is also the author of the Prequel books aimed at the same age group called Jedi Quest which is the adventures of obi-Wan and his young Padawan Anakin.In the novelization of Star Wars the adventures of Luke Skywalker (sometimes called New Hope) they expanded a little on the torture that Leia received while she was captive on the Death Star. This short book is the Journal that Leia kept while being held in the tender graces of Tarkin and Vader. It is the journal she kept throughout NH giving us her take on the greatest movie ever made.Scholastic has also produced journal for Luke and Han if you like this one."
3,interesting,"This book was a little weird, probably wouldn't order another book by the author. Not really what I expected or was looking for. I didn't read the whole thing as I got bored with it."
2,Burnt matzos,Most of the matzos were burnt. The ones that weren't burnt tasted good. I wouldn't purchase this product again.
2,"Good service, mediocre product",The delivery and price were fine but the matzos crackers were burnt (all the boxes opened so far). To be fair I haven't contacted the supplier about this problem yet. Previous product (same brand) from this supplier was fine.
4,A Most Unusual Documentary,"This film made me homesick for San Francisco. Actually, one of the reasons I wanted to see it was to see if I recognized anyone. I didn't, but then I left there in 1985, and all my old friends would be really OLD friends by now. This is mostly a young person's movie.The focus is on transgender people -- trannies, as they call themselves -- both male-to-female and female-to-male. But the scope is quite a bit broader, and includes quite a few people who are most comfortable being ambiguous. The old term is hermaphrodite, but I've managed to forget the modern term.I've been fascinated by trannies ever since the encyclopedia year book for (I think it was) 1958 published the story of Christine Jorgensen. It occurred to me that someone who had spent time as both a male and a female would have unique insights that would be of value to those of us who find it so hard to understand what the other gender feels and thinks.This movie reinforced that hypothesis."
3,Gendernauts,"This is a pretty good documentary about the life of gender non-conforming people, including transsexuals. I found it to be sympathetic of the trials and tribulations of the trans community. The documentary itself is about 10 or so years old and some might find it to be dated and lacking focus, but I found it to be a decent and entertaining look. I would recommend it to others to watch. Monika Treut comes across as being a novice at documentary film-making and I feel that it shows, but it is still worth a look-see."
3,Lack of Customer Service,The shoes were not very comfortable. I attempted to contact the seller and received no response.
5,Captivating History-With Romance and Adventure,"Susan Nagel's biography of the Countess of Elgin makes history come alive in a dramatic, romantic page-turner. You'll be transported to a land of wealth and privilege, where egg-sized emeralds are exchanged as small tokens of affection, where cannons salute the arrival of dignitaries into new ports and where love of art and love of man mixes to create a heady and destructive combination of emotions.This book is perfect for a day at the beach or an evening curled up at home - if only all history could be this fun!"
4,"Charming, simply charming.","There are two points that I didn't like. One, is very minor and really only means something to someone that is highly tuned to architectural history. The other, however, I would have liked more information on. She contends that Robert the Bruce was a descendant of someone that came over with William the Conqueror. Because I am not a Scottish history person, I would like to have know that familial line. She did not provide that and so, I feel like it is just conjecture.However, if you put those two points aside, you will find a wonderfully written book that pulls you into the story line of subject. I did not cry, but I almost did. I felt compelled for the heroine, and did not like the first husband, and fell in love with the second. So, it was indeed worth the read.This is really a 4.5 star"
4,Cute pictures,Cute stickers. Contains 20 one to two inch stickers in a little booklet. Not exactly what I was expecting but they are cute.
4,Ring pen great for arthritics,"I have used this pen almost daily for 6 months. I am a college student who suffers from arthritis severe enough that at times I can not write at all. This pen has increased the time I can write comforatbly by 4 fold. I have recently noticed some wear at the bottom of the pen which may cause the ink cartridges (which are small) to fall out in the future. Therefore, I don't know how long this pen will last. If it fails, I will buy a new one, because I can't live without it. If you don't have trouble writing with a normal pen, there is no good reason to spend so much money on this pen it's refills."
1,don't bother,"i work in an office and sometimes experience pain/fatigue from writing. i bought this pen to alleviate, but it's loose around my finger and then difficult to hold in place. plus the quality is not good, the cap that comes with the pen does not stay on. look elsewhere."
2,Doesn't stand up to constant use,"I bought this belt less than a year ago, and have worn it pretty constantly since then. Normally I wear the (dark) brown side out because most of the time I wear the belt with the khakis I have to wear for work. Four or five months into wearing the belt, I started noticing that the leather on the brown side is starting to crack. That side has completely cracked through to the next layer, and now I have to be pretty careful not to stress the belt too much when I put it on.It was a good-looking belt to begin with, and the buckle itself is very solid and nice, but it will not stand up to everyday use."
1,Very poor quality,"This is easily the worst belt I have ever owned. The leather is stiff and difficult to bend around into the buckle. The ""brown"" is so dark it is barely distinguishable from the black. Worst of all, the three layers began to separate at the point where it goes through the buckle on the first wearing. Not to mention that the bends at the buckle have set in so severely in just a few wearings that it will look awful if I gain or lose enough weigh to move to a different notch. All I can say for it is that the buckle is quite attractive."
1,Piece of Chinese Crap,"First, just like 99% of all clothes and apparel sold in USA it is made in China. Second, after just 2 weeks of wear the pieces of leather started to come apart and the hole tore and very noticeable marks developed. Don't buy this piece of crap."
4,Nice belt,This belt actually looks good either way and it doesn't look like a crappy reversible belt.
2,Purple Incense Passion Flower,"I wasn't happy because when it bloomed, it was a more common variety than a Purple Incense Passion Flower that I ordered. Took several months to bloom and that is when I realized that it wasn't the real deal."
4,Slow start,"This vine had a very slow start for me, and at one point I was tempted to pull it up and throw it away... but it did take off at the 3 month mark and is now about 4 feet. Even at the height of my frustration, I made sure to continue following the sellers instructions. The key to starting this type of vine is patience, and I've definitely learned alot from growing this beautiful vine."
2,"Already has a hole, washed once",I bought these aprons in Jan/Feb and we have washed them ONCE and the seams are already coming undone! Don't buy it!
4,We love it until...,It is great my son loves it until someone let my two small dogs out and they jumped on the slide part and ripped three holes in it. You would think it would be a little more durable considering I always make sure to keep the dogs in while it is up and the second they get out they rip three hole in it just by climbing it.
2,Fun while it lasted - dead in 3 months,"I bought a little tykes bounce house for my two kids. They loved it, and it was really fun.But the thing started falling apart very quickly. The rubber coating that keeps the air came off, so air would leak out very quickly. I bought it for them for Christmas, and three months after Christmas, it couldn't even hold three small children.The warranty is only 90 days. When I called about returning it, they said I was two weeks too late. (It's probably such a short warranty because they know that it won't last 6 months.)It's a great toy if you're rich and you can afford to spend money like this for something that won't last long. But if you aren't so rich, then you won't be as happy."
5,Excellent book!,"I was surfing the net one day and came upon the Advise Sisters' Message Board. That's how I learned of their new book, Recruiting Love. The book is excellent. It is very well written, fun to read, and perhaps most importantly - it makes sense, unlike so many other relationship books out there. I would highly recommend it."
2,Look closely,"That other reviewer is right. Look closely at these reviews and you will see why this anonymous reviewing system is a problem. Have you noticed how practically every review here is 5 stars and written with the same tone, punctuation, style and length? They read like sound-bite ads. I wonder how much time the author spent creating the multiple login IDs."
4,A Necessary Review,I am using this with a student. The opening test made me aware of her strengths and weaknesses. My student can now get help where she really needs it. A very good review book.
5,"Quality Book, Great Price, Excellent Service","I really like this book. It shows all the answers, in detail, in the back of the book and it is very reasonably priced. The only thing I don't like about this book is its title. It is actually a Fundamentals of Mathematics book. Some of my non-GED students don't like this title but I help them get over it. Once they use the book they like it.Great book!Rick"
3,Matching game,"A sturdy, well-constructed matching card game. The only problem is that the ""bugs"" all look quite a bit alike and it's a little hard for a three-year-old, although if he really concentrated, he could do it. He tired of it quickly, so we put it away and will try again when he is closer to four."
3,Red Sonja with out the sex problems,Frank Thorne is probably best know for this work on Red Sonja for Marvel.Ghita draws heavilly on that experience (or perhaps vice versa) with a lot in common with the chainmail bikini clad Sonja.The big differences come in 2 areas 1 the level of gore this is far more visceral and bloody than the Red Sonja books the other is of course the sex Red Sonja had this no sex until beaten in battle clause Ghita shares no such qualms.Franks sex scenes are quite time by the standards of the eros line which may be a good thing he also seems to marry the needs of the plot to the sex quite well so while it comes off as titilating rather than erotic it's still worth a look
4,it's okay,"It is okay,but don't use it in tournaments or against wolborg, cyber dragoon, or dragoon fighter."
4,Dragoon Storm,This beyblade has a rubber tip for endurance. This blade is not for attack it's for endurance. The TT Hongli version spins longer. It can even spin for over 3 minutes. TT Hongli is the originator of Beyblade and you can get their products off Toycup.comHere is my comboDragoon Storm attack diskDraciel V weight ring (TT Hongli version)Rock Bison base ( Get this Japanese blade of Toycup.com)
4,"Great grill, great service, damaged during shipping","The grill is fantastic. Great value. It is not a large grill, but every inch of this grill is crafted to make it useful... which means it acts like a grill that takes up more space. It gets very hot, and stays very hot. It took 30 minutes to put together - a fact that made several friends cry after losing a weekend of their lives putting together other grills. I have also purchased the side burner and pizza stone, which are nice additions. The customizable surfaces are awesome, ESPECIALLY the dishwasher safe cutting board surface.My only complaint is that it did come dented - but both amazon and the company made up for it. If the grill had been damaged more, it would probably turned into a horrible experience, as things turned out, I am VERY happy."
1,Dont buy this Brand!,"I bought this grill from William Sonoma thinking if they sell this grill, it must be a tested high quality grill. I was wrong! It is attractive and has a small footprint however, It is performance that counts. The firebox is too small and and there is only 3 flavor bars so the flair ups are extensive. The electric start never worked and the food cooked very unevenly. The rear of the grill was well done and the front was medium. I was attracted by the accessories but it is the cooking quality that counts. I promptly returned to the store and bought a Weber. Learn from my mistakes and get the best!"
2,DO NOT BUY without reading this,Poor design ...almost dangerousThe Gas tank can only be turned off and on from behind the unit...The wheels are located on only one side .. they do not swivel.. thus the unit is moved by dragging itThese items work together to make this a very poor design ...how could anyone think this is a good design?To turn on the gas you have to crawl behind the unit or drag it out from the position you placed it in.. here I make an assumption that you (like most people) have the unit backed up against a wall or something.. Remember those wheels that are only on one side and do not swivel... that means you have to drag the unit. Hard enough to do to turn it on.. even harder when the unit is hot ... that is dangerous.I am sorry .. I so much wanted to like this unit ... small and nice to look at .... but the design is so flawed as to make me think the company never even tested this unit in the fieldSome one please disagree with my comments ... what am I missing
3,"""Flavor bars""","First the good stuff. The grill is hot and cooks well, but be aware of some shortcomings. The flavor bars are cut too short and they fall of their resting place very easily. One shelf attachment screw pulled right through and some are rusting after a few weeks."
5,Great gift for new big sisters,"This was given to my daughter when she became a big sister, and it was an instant hit - and almost two years later, we still read it frequently. It has become our go-to gift for little girls becoming big sisters. :)"
4,good stuff,"First off, I do not work for this company as some reviewers do. I'm a hobbyist who experimented with this brand alginate and arrived at the following conclusion...This is a good product. It mixes surprisingly well, easy and sets in good time, not too fast and not too slow. Its skin safe and silica free which is cool. If its going to be used for dental impression mold making from the subjects mouth, it has a pleasant minty taste so no worries about chemically residue in the mouth. The mold deteriorates after a couple of days as the water in it evaporates. so its important to work quickly (but not so quickly that you're racing the clock). i wanted to use it for a creative art project but it didn't do what i wanted it to do, i needed a silicone based compound. For the creative types, this stuff is good for fun disposable kid projects too. I recommend Hollywood brand alginate. its worth it."
1,Horrible,"I bought 4 boxes of this stuff, and only got 1 to work out of them all. With two of the boxes I followed the instructions exactly, and the mix turned into a fast drying clumpy mess. With the other two I decided to try different powder-water ratios and got one of them to work with a 2-1 ratio.Complete garbage, I will never use their product again."
3,A little too basic,"Betta Care is a well written book with excellent pictures of ""Siamese Fighting Fish."" If you have only one source of information at hand, this will serve you well.Unfortunately, there is another source of information that will serve you well at a much smaller cost - the Internet. Though this book is a handy way to get all the information in one place, you can get the same info (as well as all the good pictures) on many different websites.My recommendation: If you are the type of person who likes to have the info in black and white in front of them, buy this book. If you're the type of person who spends a lot of time on the web, get the same info for free."
3,Betta Care,"The book had a lot more information for breederds than for beginners,but the information that a beginner could use, was very good."
3,poorly supported book with good ideas,"This book starts in an appealing way, telling the story of a fictitious couple & their ""just friends"" relationship. The concept of the need to guard one's heart when it comes to male/female relationships is a good one, but if a reader is looking for a solid, biblical basis for ""emotional purity"", they will not find it in this book. Also, an entire book was not needed to say, ""Guard your heart around the opposite sex, until you meet the one you know you want to marry,"" and ""Don't lead anyone on, if you have no intentions of marrying them."" the book is kind of redundant"
4,Pretty good!,"In this book the author talks about the need to keep yourself emotionally unattached to men while you are single. I recommend it to all young ladies that have problems with men, or want to protect themselves from heartache. It has a lot of good advice in it and it was worth the read! It's helped me and how I view my friendships with men, I'm glad I got it!"
4,Good review of thermodynamics,"This book is a pretty good review of basic thermodynamics and its principles. It includes fairly in-depth theory and it is a great study tool if you need to refresh yourself on the ideas of thermodynamics. It's a little outdated (I would recommend Atkins' Physical Chemistry for a more up-to-date approach) but for the price, its a great text (and a classic), one that would be great in any chemist's library."
4,Good introduction to thinking maps,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow teacher who participated in a schoolwide adoption and application of Dr. Hyerle's Thinking Maps program. Her students' test scores increased measurably in the year following adoption of this program and she attributed this gain to the schoolwide use of thinking maps. Based on her recommendation and enthusiasm, I purchased this book, and am currently trying to find ways to integrate the maps and concepts into the established district-approved curriculum."
3,Decent coffee at a reasonable price,"The coffee is a light/mild blend and not strong enough for my taste. Otherwise, it is a good choice that comes at a reasonable price."
3,Fairly Functional,"This product fulfills my need for charging multiple devices while traveling in my car, however I have noticed that I need to keep an eye on the charging lights for each device because they have a tendency to slip out of the charging socket. They dont fall out but come out just enough to lose contact with the charge. I am not sure whether its my devices or a general problem. I can live with it. Other than that the product is fine."
4,Great PDA...Good Phone,"I have had 4 Sprint phones and this one is my favorite. It is a great PDA - much better than my old Palm. My only complaints about the phone are the fact that you must use the ear bud or speaker phone, the only way to have a private conversation is using the earbud; and the relativly short battery life. Other than that I think its a great phone and especially love the fact that you can use Internet Explorer to surf the web in almost the same manner you would from home at a desktop PC. All in all I am satisfied with the Toshiba 2032."
2,Stay away from this phone,"I tried so hard for a week to make this phone work for me, because I liked the features, finally I am giving up. There is not enough power in the battrey to make it last a complete day.If Toshiba/Audiovox was in the construction business, they would have developed a city with no power supply!With the rebates I got lured into buying what other recommended not to. I thought I will make it work for me, against odds. The phone is so bad, I would not take it for free (considering the 2 year contract)STAY AWAY FROM THE TOSHIBA 2032 !"
2,cool but too many drawbacks,"I've had mine several years. Pro: It takes a beating! From dropping it to spilling coffee on it, it still works. Great to have so much in one item. The handwriting recognition is great, it really works.Con: The mp3 player is not loud enough, I can still hear people talking around me, even with the volume all the way up. Battery life is terrible. Phone never actually rings, it keeps re-setting itself for no ringer. It also keeps turning itself on, and when I'm listening to music, keeps beeping. The sound quality on the speaker phone is awful, and there's no way I'm going to ba able to get the headphone plugged in in time for a phone call. I hate that you have to use the headphones or speaker phone, you can't just use it like a regular phone.It may have some cool features but I would not buy it again."
1,Buggy and not well designed,"As others have written, the inability to use this like a regular phone is irritating (headset or speakerphone only). Being able to surf is nice, but, only practical if you turn off pictures and still really slow. My device also had a strange bug where it would turn on and the lower left menu would pop up repeatadly, which is really annoying. I've switched to a smaller, normal phone and am much much happier."
3,"For Sharon Moxon ""mzliberty """,Check your guarrantie mine doesn't resets itself an actually rings and vibrates you better check it and it's true the batery is horrible i actually changed it and for the volume use another earbuds i use it with headset jack not with speaker )it sucks) well that's all hope my review helped yoy
5,Purple Prestige Medical Criterion Plus Sprague Kit,The item arrived quickly! Item was described very well. Everything works really well. I will order another one in the future for a cousin of mine. It is definitely worth the investement! :)
3,blood pressure cuff and stethescope,"Not sure if the calibration is ""on"" but I don't want to return it as I had a hard time getting the kit in the first place. Cuff sent, stethescope forgotten Took 3 weeks to get the kit. LOVE the purple colour though"
4,It's not bad,This protector is not bad at all. It's hard to install it without having dust and air underneath protector but one you succeed it's almost unnoticeable. I give it 4 stars because the quality of image becomes a little worse. Otherwise - it's a good thing to buy.
1,IMPOSSIBLE,"Okay, For one, I don't know how this is getting good reviews. Maybe I got a lemon...There are two things that i hate about this product.1) It is matte. The surface to write on is not smooth. This makes writing akward and unpleasant.2) It is nearly impossible to apply and since only 1 comes in the package if you mess up... you mess up...DONT GET THIS! Its also overpriced! $!2 for 1!!! C'mon.. At j&r; they sell a 15 pack of a similar product for $9.99This is a waste of money."
2,Not a product of quality,I bought this product because of the Kohler name. I installed it and every time I try to get soap from it I have to pump it MANY times to get anything out.I DO NOT recommend this product. Don't be fooled by the Kohler name.
4,good for small patios or balconies,i dont have the exact george foreman grill the specs say this stand is designed for.so i purchased a large plexiglass cutting board to sit a different model george foreman grill atop.works well on my condo balcony and makes a good plant platform when not grilling.compact and easy to assemble.
4,No line included with reel.,"There was no line included with the reel. It had to be purchased separately. Though it was not mentioned in the summary of the product, I had expected the reel to be ready to use."
1,Disappointed,I bought this for my grandfather as his Christmas gift. When it arrived it looked that a child's rod and reel kit. It is tiny. I returned it because it didn't seem appropriate to give this to my grandfather. Speedy shipping and return though
1,Weight Please???,"I would never buy any product that advertises its self as ultralight and then does not list its weight. I have searched at least 20 sites trying to find the weight of the rod, the reel, and the case. If your going to advertise a product as ultralight it seems very poor judgement to have no information of the actual weight anywhere. Obviously shipping weight is not a useful number. As an avid ultralight camper, fisher, hiker, and rafter, I would not trust any company who does not list the weight of gear advertised as ultralight."
2,Reel jumps off the rod,"Pros: It packs up nice. I has extra compartments in the case for a few pieces of tackle. It is easy to assemble, break down, and pack into case.Cons: I had to restring the reel with new line because the line that came with it kept snapping. I lost two fish because of it. The biggest con is the fact that when I get a hit and snatch the rod back, about every other time the reel will jump off the rod. Then I have to bumble around and get the reel back on quickly so I can continue reeling the fish in. I don't have the problem at all when I put the reel on another rod. I have tried tightening it, but it just seems to be a flaw in the design."
5,I own two of them,Great rod to use if you're just looking to fish off the dock or on land. I wouldn't use it deep-sea fishing though. The combo is meant for a maximum of 4 pound testline. I have used it the whole summer and haven't had any issues with it. I've put alot of force on the rod trying to break loose of many snags and the rod hasn't broken yet. The Reel has 3 setting:1st setting - Left - allows the reel to spin in either direction (reel-in or let out more line)2nd setting - Center - allows the reel to make a clicking sound when something is pulling your line3rd setting - Right - one way reeling that locks doesn't let the fish get away unless it breaks your line.
1,malisimo,este libro carece de virtudes artisticas y o literarias. su unica importancia proviene de que fue publicado en los albores de la guerra civil norteamericana que significo el fin de la esclavitud y la derrota del sur. la escritora narra una historia absurda y un personaje totalmente sumiso y sin sentido. LUIS MENDEZ
2,"Calculus with Applications, Brief Version (10th edition)","The book itself was in good shape but it took too long to get it. Although it came within the time suggested, there was no way to tack it even though it took weeks to received after it supposedly shipped. I ended up buying the book somewhere else and returning this one when it finally came."
1,Worst Math Book I've Ever Used,This is by far the worst math book I've ever used and I would not only avoid this book if possible but I would also avoid any class associated with this book.
5,One of the best cookbooks I own,"This has become one of the books I reference most often. I like the individual recipes, but I absolutely LOVE the recipes for full dinners and buffets. I have made the cocktail for 40 not once, but twice, and it was a smashing success both times. My new mother-in-law so enjoyed the frozen apple waldorf salads I made for an inlaws visit recently, she asked for the recipe - when I removed it from my cupboard, she said, oh, I have that cookbook, but I haven't looked at it. What a shame! It's one of my all-time favorites!"
5,Highly recommend,"My copy is worn due to its extreme use as almost every recipe in this book is a keeper. You can prepare tasty gourmet meals ahead, leaving time to visit with guests, and still serve them a meal that will wow them over.We particularly like the Piquant Mini Meatloaves and the White Chocolate Chip cookie recipe will make anyone happy.Highly recommend."
5,ATTENTION ALL AQUA FANS: READ THIS,"For many of you Aqua fans, they have released an official book, which is a must-have. This book contains exclusive photos, biographies of each member, stories of their success, and so much more. If you like Aqua so much, this must be the book for you."
4,Good for Agua fans only,If your a fan of the fun pop/dance group Aqua then you will probably enjoy this book. It tells the story of the group right from childhood and follows them up to the release of their first album and tour. I found it very interesting and well set out. A very good read
3,"Lots of info on Aqua, but bad writing.","Has a lot of previously unknown pictures of Aqua, and a lot of pictures, which I love. But in my opinion Jacqui Swift uses words like ""sensational!"" and such words about every other sentence, which makes it kind of strange to read. I mean, Aqua have really done the unexpected and sensational, but all they do is not sensational! It becomes a bit unnatural..."
2,Too much story!,"This disc is trying to do Beethoven's Pastorale in nature sounds when all I want is a background. There are over twelve minutes of happy birds singing in the sunshine before the thunder is distantly heard. This is not about rain: it's birds bracketing a thunder display. So don't expect it to be good for sleeping, or even to provide a white sound background."
3,chart topping hits?,"to see if these are really the hits, i compiled a list of the songs and the peak positions on the billboard hot 100 chart.. Rock Your Body - Justin Timberlake-- #52.

2,"Think yourself lucky, America!","Now 13?!!! Man, this series has been running in the UK since the early 80's, and we are on NOW 57 over here, would you believe?!Our versions are all double CD's, and as collections of recent chart-hits, they were peerless at one point - if the market is flooded with similar discs right now, it is only because of the fact that the NOW guys started the trend. Guess you will either love 'em or hate 'em...but 57 editions later, SOMEONE must be buying them!!!"
2,It was ok,It was ok.I like Stuck and The girl all the bad guys want is mostly what I listen to.Others are ok.I like a few other.But I have some ideas for Now 14Rock wit u(aww baby)-ashantiCrazy in love-Beyonce Knoweles and Jay-ZMy love is like.....whoa-MyaAct a Fool-.......To the window to the wall-........Miss Independent-Kelly ClarksonIn da club-50 centWhy Not-Hilary DuffDilema-Nelly and Kelly Rowland21 questions-50 centThats all I can think of.Great job with the now I have them all from Now to Now 13.I'll buy the next one.No matter whats on it.Those are just ideasbye
2,What happened??,"I don't know why these albums can't have punk-pop and pop-rock songs all us fans have HEARD of(well besides the Ataris song and Girl All The Bad Guys Want). I think if I could suggest 3 songs for Now 14, I'd suggest these:Ataris - Boys of SummerNew Found Glory - My Friends Over YouMichelle Branch - Are You Happy Now"
3,"there have been better ""Now!s""","This is an OK compilation, but some of the songs are boring. Here are my ratings on each song.PLEASE NOTE: ""O"" means ""Outstanding"", ""E"" means ""Exceeds Expectations"", ""A"" means ""Acceptable"", ""P"" means ""Poor"", and ""D"" , means ""Dreadful"".Justin Timberlake...

1,crap,wow. thats got to be the worst collection of music EVER...except for chevelle i don't even know why that's on there...and godsmack's ok. how can people listen to this crap!? i don't understand. go get some talent!
4,Skip Now 13 -> Get Now 55,"While I have to admit that Now 13 shows at least some improvement over the rather sad Now 12 compilation, it's still missing most of the biggest hits of the year. And too often they replaced an acts biggest hit this year with a less successful track. Examples: The Ataris ""In This Diary"" instead of ""The Boys Of Summer"" and 3 Doors Down ""The Road I'm On"" replaces the mega-hit ""When I'm Gone"".The big missing tracks are, of course, 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"" and R Kelly's ""Ignition (Remix)"". You'l also get tracks by Wayne Wonder and other hits from Justin, Jay-Z, DJ Sammy, Coldplay, Mariah Carey & t.A.T.u.Both of these are on the UK version of the NOW series (Search Amazon for ""NOW 55"") a 2-CD set which shares some other tracks or artists with this set. Many of these tracks have already appeared on earlier UK NOW albums, so check out NOW 54 and NOW 53 as well."

Clocks - Coldplay = Good song 5/5
5,Another great cd,"i love this cd, there really is nuthin better then to pop a cd into your car and hear Justin followed by J-Lo. Even though Britney doesnt make an appearance on the cd, there are plenty of other artists that make up for it. I really like how this installment of the Now series has some good punk on it like Sum 41 and The Ataris...hopefully Now 14 will have even more!!!"
2,Good?,"I think this is a terrible item. Anyone whoo says it is good is only in to pop and rap but now is supposed to be the top 18 or 20 hits not only the top 20 rap songs. I disagree with the rating of an A+ if you really want to know a good album check out Now 17, which has more rock on it, more modern. Just because you dont know a band or artist doesnt mean they arent amazing!!!!!!!!!"
2,A disappointing release,"I own every volume in the NOW series, but the last few haven't been worth the purchase. This one has one real pop hit, Justin Timberlake's ""Rock Your Body"", as well as some lesser hits by B2K and J. Lo. Plus, the entire last portion is rock songs I've never heard of before. Some of these songs failed to chart or failed to reach the Top 40. I suggest that the NOW series ends, at least until the state of radio improves or they can put some ligitimate hits on an album. If you want any of these songs, buy the artist's album. This isn't worth the money or the time it takes to listen to it."
1,(Useless) 13.0,"Yet another useless compilation meant to cash-in on the music buying base. This CD has nothing good on it and is just another slapdash crumb-ridden dish of bland pop )B2K), sickeningly stupid R&B garbage (""I'm Glad"" J.Lo) UGH!, and generic rock. This CD is a complete and total waste of time and I ask to avoid this CD. Now has gotten worse and worse with time. I can't believe that the series has sunk so low. I sure don't want to look at the tracklising on Now 14 whenever that comes out! Many of these songs charted poorly or haven't even charted at all! Goes to show how sloppy the Now series has gotten lately. The series needs to be TERMINATED immediately before it ruins more minds. For the few who have bought into this gunk, go ahead and buy this. I just feel sorry for the mental arrest that it will cause you. End of story!"
4,Better than the first which was good.,Better character development and tighter plot than first novel. Love scenes still a bit stiff. Excellent description of what the area was like during the Civil War.
3,Ghoulish,An intense movie about a freelance cameraman struggling with life in the city. He is a complete vulture how films the horrors of life and sells them to the highest bidding local news station.While in a drugged state he sees a crime in progress and grabs his camera to document it and happens upon three men tearing a woman to shreds. He realizes that he didn't put a tape in his camera and proceeds to hunt down the men only to find death and desperation.I didn't really like many of the characters but this is a good movie. Some people will be offended by the main character (portrayed excellently by Timothy Muskatell).
2,Moved WAY too Slow.,"I like the idea for this film. It had great potential, like a modern update of the Night Stalker [Darin Mc Gavin's old TV show] . I didn't mind the low budget either. I like low budget films , in some ways better than high budget films. My problem with this film was the speed it moves. It was like it was filmed on cement. It needed a ton of editing too to improve it. I was fooled by the box too. I thought it was a zombie movie."
3,Where's Tiffany?...,"OK, I loved EASTER BUNNY KILL! KILL!, so I figured I'd check out Chad Ferrin's early work, THE GHOULS. Well, while it's not altogether awful, it's certainly not that great either. GHOULS does capture the whole grindhouse / cult aesthetic, w/ grimy atmosphere and cheeezy action. Unfortunately, it also drags along at a wounded turtle's pace for the first hour. Also, it could have benefited from more humour. I'm a big Tiffany Shepis fan, so her name also drew me in, which is funny since she's in the movie for -almost- two and a half seconds! THE GHOULS is alright, but I seriously doubt that I'll watch it again..."
1,anyone who likes the ghouls are fhouls,WAIT!there's a ghoul no! its a fool with a camcorder ahhhhh! roar!!!! What a piece of junk! I feel bad for the ones who bought this movie.Maybe your souls will be forgiven if you resell it!That is if you can find someone willling to buy it.Please use a false name and address.We don't want them looking for you.Now back to our review.Nah! skip this review and this movie.Why waist the space on this dribble!!!!
2,"Mates, Dates and Sole Survivors",I did not like this book very much. The way these books are written are not what i like. It had hardly any humor and I didnt want to stay up and read it. The way the main character was and the way her freinds acted was almost the same. I dont know what to say except for that i didnt like it and probably wont like the others. If you think I should then go to my info and email me.I do have to say I did like the T-shirts at the end of every chapter.
4,Great book for teenage girls,"-This is a great book about 4 British teenage girls looking for boyfriends. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for a light, humourous, and realistic read. Those who have read the book ""Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging"" would like this book. One think to know: you have to know a bit of British slang in order to fully understand this book. Example: 'snogging' means 'kissing'."
1,NO GOOD ! Ignition Lock .,".Lock cylinder NOT COMPLETE - NO INFORMATION !So Ordered NEW lock cylinder --- "" BUT "" IT COMES WITH ""NO"" KEY'S !HOW DO YOU REKEY IT ? So one key will fit doors and ignition ?????Unhappy Chebby owner !Parts order came VERY fast and as described ,but now need info to make it work !I HAVE HAD TROUBLE "" PASSLOCK "" SECURITY SYSTEM 1998 K3500 and thought I'd try and throw some parts at it like the dealers or stealers would."
5,A testimony,"The content will cause you to question the effectiveness of your walk with God.Specifically in the area of soul-winning and spiritual warfare.Sincerely,Evangelist Paula R. Turner"
1,Opportunistic Lies,"This book is patent nonsense by a so-called ""Christian"" who is motivated to lie for political and personal economic reasons. She claims absurd things, like witnessing the changing of human beings into animals. Kimberly Daniels is psychotic and this book is useless to sane people or authentic Christians."
4,an enjoyable hodge-podge,"For collectors of vocal material,this one is filled with snippets from obscure performances. There are some clinkers, and some delightful surprises. Who knew Leontyne Price sang such a magnificent Manon Lescaut? Ponto claims to be planning to release many of the complete operas from which these are taken, so it may make sense to buy this set to see what you will want to invest in later, especially at this low price. The informative notes are written in quaint English."
4,Silver love pendant/necklace,"This was a beautiful gift for my wife on Valentine's Day. She loved it, very much."
4,"wanted something else, endedup with this","Bought this for my daughter for xmas. she had just turned 1. I put it together by myself (didnt' want the wife to see it untill she came down in the morning), would recommend using 2 people. As soon as I got it together I thought, my daughter will not be climbing up this for a while. Well, the next day she climbed right up the slide. I am using this inside and I have it positioned so that the ladder opening is up against the wall, so only way up is using the slide. I would say she uses it a little everyday. I did want to get a larger one...but buying in the winter, and close to xmas...selection was limited. I am not disapointed with it, will just be getting her and new brother a bigger one for grandmas house."
1,Terrible install,"Bought this toy and had a terrible time putting it together. THe manufacturer's instructions are a laugh, you need superman to assemble this one. My advice would be to stay away from this one"
3,"Informative, but not an enjoyable read...","This is perhaps one of the most informative books which I have read on this topic. It is filled with exact references and examples, complete w/ citings that can be further researched by the reader.There are two major drawbacks with this book. First off it reads like an academic dissertation or thesis work. It is slow and tedious for the reader. If you are looking for something to read in your spare time for fun only, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for ""just the facts"", this is your book.Secondly, as stated above, it seems that the author's primary focus is African tribal practice. I was hoping for a little more Western (or perhaps modern) references. However many of his tribal examples were enlightening.Overall, if you are really wanting a factual writing on this topic, Buy It.If you are wanting something to pass the time at beach, Pass."
3,Hard to Clean,If you use a marinade forget easy clean up. Too bulky to clean near sink. Useful for large meals; cooks quickly
2,Wish it was easier to clean.,"The George Foreman Grill is a good idea, however they really need to rethink how to clean this thing. Like others have said, forget using any kind of marinade or you will regret it. I wish there was some way to detach the grill and clean it under running water. Scraping off scraps of meat and wiping with a paper towel just doesn't seem very sanitary to me. Plus the teflon is scraping away after less than a year. George, can you go back to drawing board and give us a grill that we can actually wash???"
4,Very heavy lid,"I feel that the lid is very heavy and should be lighter, otherwise I love it. Food comes out delicious and healthy andcleanup is a snap."
2,disappointed,"i used my first large george foreman grill so much, that the teflon eventually came off. i raved about that grill, but the gr62 i recently purchased is a different story. i just purchased another grill, from another company to replace it. the best thing i can say about the grill, is it looks great, and it has a very large cooking surface. the problem with mine is, it doesn't actually grill the meat. unless i'm cooking a very thick steak or some other thick meat, the top cooking surface doesn't touch the top of the meat. so, one side of the meat gets light grill lines, but the other side is just browned. the cooking surface doesn't hug the meat well enough. for the most part, i end up, sort of, baking my meat instead of grilling it. i've read other reviews, where people have complained the grill doesn't get hot enough. that may be part of the problem."
1,A piece of crap!,"I wouldn't even rate this with one star!! I was given this grill for a birthday present. For the first year it was great. After about a year and a half, the non-stick finish on the grill started peeling off. Now it is a piece of crap that is hard to clean. I only cleaned it with hot water & dish soap. No abrasives! The numbers on the dial are worn off. Only a very few remain. The grease drips everywhere with very little in the drip tray. It started out as a wonderful piece of kitchen equipment but has turned into nothing but a big worthless piece of crap junk that sits on its recommended stand that you trip over the front leg as it sticks out into your walking path."
4,"very good, until the finish began to turn loose.","really enjoyed it, then the inside finish began to turn loose after about one year, so we gave it away & I bought another one.It's a good to use grill."
5,Cant Beat It,After reading the mixed reviews I decided to purchase this grill and try it myself. Its amazing it takes up a good chunk of counter space but it allows me to cook two pounds of chicked breasts at a time. Unlike some of the previous reviewers I haven't had any problems at all doing this all two bpounds done after preheating the grill for 10 minutes and cooking for 18 minutes. Cleanup was a breeze I just wiped the grill down whil it was still warm with a soapy sponge and then rinsed. Some have complained about not being able to clean marinades or spices of of the grill without scrubbing. I didn't have this problem but I also sprayed the grill after preheating with a PAM non stick spray made for indoor grills. This is one of the best buys I've made in a long time
5,Bigger is better,"This is the best George Foreman Grill made. I use it for parties, breakfast, lunch. Big enough for 12 burger and 3 (8 pack) of Hot Dogs. I also use it for Grill cheese and other sandwishes."
2,Power Problem -otherwise??,"This has nothing to do with Amazon. This product came from a brick and mortar store...I just received this grill for Christmas. I grilled sausage on it the first day and they turned out great -no complaints and better tasting than when cooked on a griddle. Unfortunately, during it's second use the power cut out. I thought it was either a curcuit breaker or Groung Fault Switch- it was neither. The dang thing just stopped working. There is no reset and it doesn't seem to have an access panel designed for consumer use. I don't want to open it up and risk violating the warranty. It would be easy to hate except (after two uses) it turned out great food -when it worked. I'm taking it back for a replacement in the hopes that this was just a fluke."
2,This CD is not very good-save your money,I gave it two stars because it has about two good songs. I would save your money.
3,Overall Size,The overall size of the box is not given. Please do so in order for me to know if I have room for it in the space I have. Thank you.
5,Mountain Woods 3x5 Roll Top Recipe Box,This was a belated Christmas Gift to my adult son who is enjoying the fact that it holds so many cards.
1,Piece of Junk! Arrived Broken!,I should have heeded the warnings of the other people who reviewed this piece of junk. Mine also arrived broken with the left side panel snapped off and unglued to the base. BUYER BEWARE!
2,Fell apart immediately out of the box,"I bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas. She wanted an extra large recipe box as one of her gifts. On Christmas morning, she opened it and was thrilled with it. As soon as she took it out of the box it began to fall apart...and I mean fall apart. Both sides of the recipe box came off and literally all of the parts were laying all over the floor. The glue must not have been strong enough to hold it together. I was mortified! Nothing like giving a person a brand new gift and seeing it fall to pieces as they take it out of the box.It looks beautiful, but don't be fooled by its looks!"
2,"Well, at least it holds 3X5 cards.....","My reason for buying something more decorative than just a normal file box was that I wanted it to sit on a shelf in my kitchen, looking nice while it held recipes.We don't always get what we want.... I got the funhouse version of a recipe box...One side is actually shorter than the other, so it sits crooked, and the rolltop portion rolls crookedly as well.Since it was so badly made, I finally wound up putting it out of sight in my cabinet.Guess I could have bought that $1.98 metal filebox after all."
2,Definitely not what they used to be!,"Many years ago I bought a recipe box just like this. It was a quality product that was well made and beautifully finished. Unfortunately, over the years the roll top wore out, so I did some investigating and was delighted to find that I could still order one that was exactly the same - or so I thought. I have no issues with the service, as it was shipped in a timely manner, but I was very disappointed when I opened the package. For whatever reason, the roll top has no finish whatsoever on it, and it sits crooked on the box itself. Why do companies start out producing a quality product and then cut corners later on? Shame on them!!!"
2,Too much money for value,I would not recommend this recipe box. It is cheaply made and the roll top lid does not roll smoothly. It is made of cheap materials. Not worth the money.
1,Very cheaply made,"I was very disappointed in this. I am so sorry I spent so much money on something so flimsy. I have thought of saving it and giving it away as a Christmas gift next year, but in good conscious I am too embarrassed to give such a shoddy present. If it costs too much to return it, it will go to the Goodwill. PLEASE, do not waste your money on this. I will keep searching. Elaine"
3,They don't all work,"I did get a lot of ink for a low price, but some of the cartridges did not work in the printer. A couple of them leaked after removing the plastic strip and some did not allow the ink to drain from the cartridge. I had purchased this type of cartridge for the Brother printer once before and was completely satisfied. The second order was not quite so good. Stick with the Brother brand cartridges."
5,Made me want to learn more.,Never before have I read a history book that was so riveting. I read it and then read it again.The other reviews give great details into why this book was so good so I will only add this: This is a book that rekindled a desire in me to read more and to learn more.
1,Shakespeare,"My review of this book would indicate that the author has taken Lincoln out of context for his period and once again tried to put him in some hallowed hall. A simple review of the bible and Shakespeare plays which were Lincoln's main references would enlighten one to the origin of the speech. As for the support of the Declaration vs. the Constitution, I would hope Lincoln would find some legal status for his actions as he virtually distroyed the Constitution and reset our government on its present socialist agenda. Perhaps the only worst president has been Clinton.(by the way, my family fought on both sides and ran the underground railroad)"
5,Important,"Garry Wills, the author, explores, analyzes, and provides sensible commentary on Lincoln's great vision for keeping us all one country (united we stand, divided we fall). I think this book provides essential information for any American who wants to understand why our country is as great as it is without reading jingoism, fake patriotism, or corny, hokey, screwy whacky stuff.Wills gives us an intelligent word-portrait of a great man who gave us a true prescription for what freedom actually means and why we are its guardians."
2,Boredom.,"I have never panned a book about Lincoln before, but there's a time and a place for everything it seems. This book is well researched, insightful, and in some places even illuminating, but it reads like a doleful college thesis, lacking a cohesive focus and existing without any tempo or cadence or rhythm whatsoever. Lincoln himself is not exactly the central figure, nor is the Gettysburg Address. For a while it seems Edward Everett is the focus, then the history of ancient cemeteries looms largest, with rambling discussions of Greek and Roman resting places and their evolution from urban to rural, etc. etc. etc. I suppose in all fairness, I should mention that Gettysburg, the place, is the subject. Do yourself a favor: visit the Memorial, skip the book."
4,An excellent book that falls just a bit shy of 5 stars,"This book is so close to being a five star on the amazon.com rating scale. It is an excellent book that fizzles out at the end. The only other problem is that Wills begins taking issue with the works of Mc Pherson and never truly substantiates his claims. To me it appeared that Wills has some point of contention with Mc Pherson, but he never fully develops the conflict. Wills book is not long, but it is very detailed and loaded. When reading this book you can tell that the words were chosen very carefully by the author. It is THE book on the Gettysburg address."
4,Great thing to have,For those who want to do the work themselves this book works out great. I used this to change change the brakes and rotors as well as change a few other things.
1,Not updated.,"This is merely a relabeled older edition. The one I bought said for through 2007. In 2005, they did make some changes to the engine and this does not cover that. Specifically, the water pump belt no longer uses a tensioner. Our 2001 did, the 2005 does not and theis only shows how to remove the older one. Didn't need a book for that one.I wrote them and all I got back was the standard canned, thank you response. For what they want for them, it should be better."
3,Our problem not covered.,"Certainly no manual can cover everything, but we bought the more costly manual hoping for complete information. -- We were looking for information re: coolant system warning light. -- There is nothing on that subject. So for us it was an expensive waste. --"
4,World War II German Resistance,"This film is essential viewing (particularly for those born since 1960)to gain insight into the rarely mentioned german resistance movement.Contains authentic interviews with participants and/or close relativesof those who took part.Well worth viewing from a historical point of view, this film alsoprovokes discussion about the world 60 years later"
5,"Gripping, vivid and heartbreaking. A must see.","This film is amazing. It grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Ms. Beller had to use archival film footage, old photos and interviews with the elderly family and friends of the brave Germans who tried to put an end to the tyranny. No actions shots, little color, no special effects, yet you can't stop watching. Fantastic work. I saw a library copy, but I'm going to purchase a copy."
4,Anti-Nazi Resistance Inside Germany,"""The Restless Conscience"" is an Academy Award nominee that explores the motivating principles and activities of the anti-Nazi resistance inside Germany from 1933 to 1945. The film is a moving portrayal of individual destinies, focusing on the moral and political evolution of people whose conscience was at odds with an overpowering national consensus. Filmmaker Hava Kohav Beller points out that in 1944, at least 170 German citizens were convicted as participants in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. This was the last of more than 20 attempts to overthrow the Nazi regime. ""The Restless Conscience"" highlights the tension between individual responsibility to a personal ethical code and fear of a tyrannical political system. Bonus extras include an interview with the filmmaker."
4,"Powerful, intelligent and fascinating","This documentary explores a much under-examined element of Hitler'sGermany. German citizens, some of high army rank or social status, whorisked everything, and usually forfeited their lives to try to stopHitler.These people had nothing to gain, and everything to lose. They could ofgone along quietly, and kept their lives and their life styles, Butinstead they trade it all to fight for an ideal.The film-making itself can be a bit dry; lots of talking heads, WW IIfootage and stills, and fairly dispassionate sounding narrators tellingus the facts. But the stories themselves are heartbreaking - especiallythe desperate attempts to warn the outside world what was coming,getting only mistrust and indifference in response.Also remarkable are the bits of actual footage from the show trials theNazi's gave these men before killing them. Their quiet, brave dignityin the face of death is deeply powerful."
4,101 Strings- The Heart & Soul of Mexico,"This is a great 101 Strings album. It offers a great variety of instrumental versions of all time Mexican musical favorites. More songs have been added to the CD re-issue than there were on its vinyl Lp ""Alshire"" or ""Somerset"" labels predecessor ""The Soul of Mexico"". The only flaw I find in this re-issue by ""Madacy"" is the exclusion of ""Adios Mariquita Linda"", a great romantic classic, masterfully arranged in the 60's by 101 Strings superbly skilled maestro Monty Kelly. Madacy should re-issue this song in another CD. In spite of the exclusion it is a great compilation."
5,Simply Delicious - Simply the BEST!,"My youngest daughter owns this book and loaned it to me, I'm an experienced 'scratch' cook and this book has amazed me with it's simplicity, the recipes are easy enough for novices and presentable enough to fix for company. I highly recommend it to new brides, college kids, experienced cooks and gourmets - you just can't lose and the presentation is wonderful. Just ordered 4 for gifts. If you have an up coming wedding to buy for, add this inside a lovely covered casserole dish and the bride will thank you forever."
4,Great Info - if you can ignore the production value,"The book is full of very informative and elusive information about how our monetary system works behind the scenes. The author has taken great pains to explain and in some cases prove his points, and reveals some really scarry information. It's question and answer style was a little hard to take at first, but it's not written for it's style, but it's content. I would give it a 5 if it weren't for it's style. It's not an entertaining book, but the information it gives-- is."
4,COMEDY CLASSIC!,One of the series' best finds Ernest in love and on the run from jewel thieves in Africa. It's great to see Ernest in such an exotic setting.
5,Great movie.,"This is by far the greatest movie ever made.I love Ernest,but all his other movies suck.This is by far,the best Ernest movie ever made.I love when he's in Africa.I watch it every time,and every year.If you haven't seen this movie,your missing alot."
2,Maybe he's too funny to be appealing.,"I saw this movie today and the one thing that disgusted me about this movie more than anything was that woman Renee. She totally deceived a funny, warm-hearted guy who really had feelings for her. How bitchy she treated him was in my opinion absolutely uncalled for. All he wanted was for her to be his girlfriend, but all he got was hurt feelings and deception instead. She was mean and what I'd rather see in a movie is a nice woman who gives the hero the love and romance he deserves.I hope you see my point in my sincere interview.Steve"
2,Ernest's downfall,"I've always pretty much liked the Ernest movies. Yes, they are silly and whatnot but they were always funny and I can't think of another actor who can make such funny faces. Unfortunately, in this one the budget was seemed to have been kept to a maximum of about 200 bucks. It's very low budget and it was dissappointing to see Ernest in something so stupid.The story was cheesy, flimsy, and stupid. The actors (excluding Ernest himself) were horrible, and it was altogether just cheesy. Ernest also wasn't very funny in this one at all. His co-star, that dumb waitress who goes along with Ernest to Africa was so mean and stupid I just wanted to slap her across the face. Anyways, there's not much to say about this movie except if you want some real Ernest, I'd suggest ""Ernest goes to Jail"",""Ernest Scared Stupid"", or ""Ernest goes to school."""
3,Pretty Good Ernest,"This is what I'd call Pretty Good Ernest. Not up to the level of Brilliant Ernest (e.g. ""Ernest Rides Again""), but better than Banal Ernest (e.g. ""Slam Dunk Ernest"").If you're already an Ernest fan, you'll probably get a kick out of this movie. If you're just getting started on Ernest, I'd recommend one of ""Ernest Rides Again"", ""Ernest Goes to School"", ""Ernest Goes to Camp"", or ""Ernest Goes to Jail."""
4,"It's a Knick-Knack Patty-Jack, Give the Frog a Loan!","Ernest is back, but this one wasn't as good as most Ernests but definatly better than Ernest Scared Stupid and Slam Dunk Ernest. There were a few things I didn't like, though. I didn't like the woman who cared about her car, she was a jerk. And when Ernest made that Yo-Yo the ""Eyes"" he made it out of became a compleatly different shape. And Ostrich eggs don't break that easily (you can stand on one and it still wouldn't break!). Dispite these things, it was still pretty good!"
2,Not for attachment parents,"While this book offers good information on baby massage, it also includes harmful advice on baby's sleep needs, recommending solitary sleep in a crib, starting at four months.Babies need their parents beside them at night, for many emotional and physical reasons. Every baby knows this, that's why they so strongly resist sleeping alone. Forcing a baby to become independent before they are ready to do so is unhelpful, unrealistic, and damages the bond between parent and child. Would the authors recommend forcing a rose to bloom?Solitary sleeping in early childhood is one of the main reasons so many adults in our culture have sleep disorders. It seems completely inconsistent to promote such a loving practice as baby massage and then give misinformed, harmful advice on sleep. I urge all readers to visit The Natural Child Project at [...] and click on articles/sleep for informed and caring advice on this subject."
5,Outstanding book!,"After looking at nearly every massage book out there, I decided to buy this one and have not been disappointed with my choice. The main thing that clinched it for me was the fact that it is illustrated so well - every stroke has a photograph and a detailed description, making it so easy to follow. I found that many other books have line drawings rather than photos for many of the strokes. I also like the fact that there is not too much information. It is clear and concise - just what you need when you're holding the book open with one knee while attempting to massage a wriggly newborn!My 2 month old daughter absolutely adores massage time, and has done since the day we brought her home. This book is my number one ""must have"" for all parents. Massaging your baby is a wonderful bonding experience, and one which can be continued into the toddler years."
5,Paris through female eyes,"Profusely illustrated and painstakingfully researched, this book is an enlightening account of women who between wars found their self and their own voice in Paris. Though mostly concerned with the stories of lesbian or bisexual women such as Colette, Gertrude Stein, Alice Toklas, Sylvia Beach, Djuna Barnes and Natalie Barney who came to the City of Light attracted by an aura of unbridled freedom missing in their places of origin, this book will appeal to all those who are interested in this fascinating early period of the twentieth century as well."
5,Innovation where it is needed!,"Finally, in our saturated music world, this ""melting-pot"" of an album brings something truly refreshing. Every track is first curious then suprising. Try mixing jazz,latino, hip hop and a little rock in your head and you might get close to what these guys have to offer!"
2,could have been so much better...,"I usually don't review what I consider one- & two-star items; this DVD is an exception. For some it may be worth more stars. It is at least four-star in quality and content. But Vaults is presented with a continuous flow of sophomoric attempts at humor. The host, Tom Cavanagh, does a lot of things right. He is appropriately hands-on and asks relevant questions. The Smithsonian staff are great. If the intended audience is pre-10-year-olds, raise the number of stars to three."
4,The vaults of the Smithsonian? How could it NOT be good?,"The subject matter is fascinating and never gets old. I could watch ten more seasons. As for Tom Cavanagh, I can't help but like the guy. He brought levity without disrespect, and a fun, spontaneous humor. I especially enjoyed seeing him interact with the occasionally awkward and serious-to-a-fault curators (all of whom I deeply respect, I might add). More than once his jokes fall on deaf ears and he gets blank looks instead of laughs, which makes them even funnier. Some of the curators are surprisingly lively. He talks fast, but I appreciate that because he's getting as much information in as possible in a short time. You'll love him or hate him."
4,Good,"This game is exellent. I wish that this game would be available currently so I would be able to buy a new ""Go West!""."
4,Well above average ...,"for contemporary chess books. The content is of high quality and clearly presented. There are some problems with the design and layout, though, which suggest the triumph of enthusiasm over thought -- some ""sidebar"" diagrams are confusingly placed,the shaded tint blocks are too heavy, and the garish ""colored"" diagrams are merely distracting. The bio of the 70-year-old Krogius is accompanied by what seems to be his high school class picture, and to include a page on publisher Al Lawrence along with grandmasters Alburt, Krogius, and sevaral world champions, is quite inappropriate. Nevertheless, a good instructional work at a price no higher than is usual these days."
5,deadly diversion,"I eagerly awaited this second mystery featuring Monika Eberhardt, a nurse who also solves mysteries that arise in the hospital setting. Eleanor Sullivan successfully evokes situations in hospitals today and uses them to create the environment for her mystery stories. I thought this one was even better than the first and highly recommend it."
1,Deadly Diversion,"This was quite the most inane book I've encountered since correcting sixth grade papers during my teaching career. If there was a plot, it was certainly well-hidden."
5,Intensive Care or Intensive Murder?,"At St. Teresa's Hospital, ICU head nurse Monika Everhardt struggles with serious understaffing, an insensitive boss, and a visit from the accreditation commission. In the meantime two patients have died. The younger son of the first patient gives one nurse a black eye and threatens the rest of the staff. The medical examiner calls the death of the second patient suspicious. To clear her staff, Monika embarks on a hunt for the truth. The trail leads her from the bars of South St. Louis to a casino on the Mississippi to the home of a retired undercover cop whose beat was the St. Louis mafia back in the old days.In Deadly Diversion, Eleanor Sullivan provides a puzzle to challenge the most demanding mystery lover, and she provides food for thought. Along with a gripping plot, you've got engaging characters, the humor and drama of the hospital workplace, and a view of today's health care issues from the nursing perspective. Deadly Diversion is a great read. Enjoy."
2,Molechaser didn't chase,"The product was, as advertised, easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since I installed it. So far, it does not appear to have affected the mole population, however. To be fair, it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device (instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil, although the critters have dug quite close to it). To be really bend-over-backwards fair, I suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles, although the telltale signs are exactly what I understand mole tunnels to look like."
1,Vibrasonic Mole Chaser Review,"When I initially placed the Mole Chaser in my front yard, within an hour a discoved a mole outside the ground in my yard. We rid ourselves of one mole. After that time, we continue to find mounds in our yard, frequently within a foot of the Vibrasonic Mole Chaser. Unfortunately, we were only able to rid ourselves of one mole. There are many still feasting in our yard. I am disappointed. We purchased two of the Mole Chasers, but we are disappointed."
3,P3 Mole Chaser,"I purchased a couple of P3 International Vibrasonic Mole Chaser based on the recommendation of a friend in the area, and to prevent damage I had last winter. He had severe mole problems and the P3 chaser worked great. Unfortunately, when I received the items,the instructions stated the P3 should be removed during the winter."
3,MoleChaser,"Purchased the product in hopes that it would atleast thwart the mole problem, and it didnt. It did however, slow down activity in the area around the device. It did not completely get rid of the problem. The moles seemed to dig just a few feet past the device and around the area.The device is sturdy and lasts longer than expected on the D cell batteries. I still have it in my yard and will keep it there to hopefully deter any other moles from digging in."
1,About what I expected - nothing,"You have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is? This product is proof of that. I really wanted to avoid poison and traps so I thought I would try this P.O.S. to solve my gopher problem humanely. Sure I was skeptical, but some buyers reported success. After 4 weeks, I can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product. I noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity, but I have seen nothing. Nada. Zip. Numerous fat happy gophers before, numerous fat happy gophers after.Caveat Emptor"
1,Moles love it!,Pretty sure this thing actually summoned moles into my yard.I think the little buggers are still laughing at this.
2,Gophers? Don't bother.,"It's true. This doesn't do anything to deter gophers. I'm convinced they like it. Maybe it's a free massage. The best deterrent I've found so far is a playful and friendly dog. What's playful and friendly for the dog (honestly playful and friendly, he does no harm to the gopher) is quite the opposite from the gopher's perspective."
2,Mole vibrasonic,"Mole tunnels run right past the vibrator, and yes I hear them both working.I would expect to see no tunnels in the area."
2,Disappointment,"I have used the product before with modest success. However, I now have two in my front yard, and they now seem to attract moles and gophers rather than repel them - I have a new burrow this morning right NEXT to the still beeping molechaser! Will call an exterminator this weekend."
5,Mole chaser,The devices arrived swiftly and at a good price. Not sure if they are working as I can't see the voles - only their holes.
2,Cautiously optimistic,"I placed 2 mole chasers about 4 weeks ago in my back yard. I have sandy soil so I placed them about 30' apart (shorter interval with sandy soil/farther for clay soil). So far, no success. The moles are still tunneling the same as previous. I know the mole tunnels are active because every time I smash the tunnel down, within an hour, it is back up. These tunnels are within close proximity of the mole chaser. I took the cap off to determine if they were still working and they are. I haven't given up on the mole chasers yet, but I'm getting nervous. My friend used a mole chaser in the past with success, so I'm remaining ""cautiously optimistic""."
1,More of an attractant than deterrant,"Well I hoped this would be the solution to end all my mole problems...or at least provide some better results than a do nothing strategy. Initially I saw a lull of activity after strategically placing the P3 International P7906 Vibrasonic Molechaser in the worst part of my yard. I even bragged to my neighbor that i had found the perfect solution. Well about 7 days later i started noticing that my ""friend"" was back with a vengeance. He had the gull to dig up piles of dirt two feet away from my ""molechaser"" and more. Finally after about the 10th mole mound I concluded that this mole has seen too many episodes of Caddy Shack and the escapades of his cousin the gopher. I sent an email back to the vendor and quickly got back my RMA. I guess i need to try a different approach...anyone have a hammer...."
1,Save your money!,"I bought two of these. I've had them out for months, and have new tunnels all around them. They simply do NOT work."
1,P3 International P7906 Vibrasonic Molechaser,"There's one born every minute. If that's you then send your money for this molechaser, it's your destiny. Everyone else should just slowly move away from the computer so as not to activate a one click purchase on this rube-magnet.Best of luck with the critters. Try chili pepper, at least it's cheaper."
1,My story,"I have 2 acres with heavily forested edges that I gladly share with a wide variety of wildlife. I have a huge mole problem in the grassy area in the middle. I bought two of these units and placed them in the areas of worst infestation. Imagine my thrill the next morning when I saw 3 mole trails heading for the edges in a straight line (instead of the normal meandering route they usually use). But in a week, they were not only back, but practically circling the units. I tried to follow all the tips another review gave, but if anything, things are worse than they were before. I guess I'll try putting these out again in the spring. but not sure why.Also, I can hear the sound these units make, and I don't like it at all. But I'm real fussy about sounds. I thought it would be like my indoor sonic pest chasers, which are inaudible. These seem to work well, since I have had no indoor pests since I installed them (years). Before, well we won't talk about that."
1,Mole Lovers Delight,Don't waste your money. I bought two of these. A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year. I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight! Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps.
1,The moles will laugh as they run circles around this thing!,"Sorry, but I tried this thing and it was a waste of money. I'm not kidding when the mole made a circle all the way around the thing to check it out. He then went along with his regular business of tearing up my yard.The search for something that works continues."
3,P3 International P7906 Vibrasonic Mole Chaser,"What I like about this product is that it is over 16 inches long as other mole chasers on the market are 12 to 14 inches. It is made out of sturdy anodized aluminum, most of the other mole chasers are made of plastic. It sounds at 8-second intervals, other chasers are every 15 seconds.What I don't like about it is that it makes a rattling sound that doesn't seem to work as well as the buzzing sound that other mole chasers make.Where I have the chasers that buzz on my lawn the grass is comming back thick and green. Where the P3 International's are the grass is not growing back yet and it has been over two weeks.If I were to purchase another mole chaser I would purchase one that buzzes not rattle."
1,Doesn't work,"Plain and simple, these don't work. I started off with a couple, no success. I thought maybe I needed more to minimize the coverage radius..., nope. I can just see those little varmits gathering around these things in the ground, eating worms and just laughing when these make their goofy little sonic rattling noice."
4,"Finally, they are gone!","After about 45 days waiting, it works. The hard part is to get the mole chaser into the ground and wait for the result. Hope they will not come back."
1,Defective out of box,Ordered 4 new units and out of the box they do not work not unless you hold the unit in your hand. When placed in canister they stop. Had great luck with the product in the past. The manufacture must be outsourcing to cut corners. Moles are digging around the units placed in yard. Looking for another brand that works.
1,For people who are dumber than moles,Bought two. Ran them all spring at opposite ends of the lawn. ABSOLUTELY no help. Not worth any money at all.
3,Disappointed,Anyone on a mission to erdicate moles from burrowing across your lawn will want to try one of these mole chasers. I have tried all of the standard remedies without much success. I bought the mole chaser as a last resort and with low expectations. I placed it in my yard and it has worked well in a small area. The claim that it repels moles for up to 1/3 of an acre is not valid in my lawn. It does work well for up to 50 from the molechaser. I can honestly say that it does appear to work better than anything else that I have tried.
1,Not Happy,The Vibrasonic Mole Chaser is a joke. We bought four of them. We had new mounds with in inches of one of them a month after we installed them.
2,So-so,"This book is not a book I would refer to for ideas on decorating style. I guess I can't expect Home Depot to offer much in that area. It does offer good how-to-do-it instructions for specific projects. So, I give it a C-minus."
3,Review from IMDB customer,"Cute, Silly Movie, 24 September 2010Author: Otsu Notuchame from JapanThis is a cute, SILLY movie about a so-called all girl punk band. Do not be fooled by the title Velveteen Muff. There are no sex scenes in this movie. If you are looking for just an entertaining little film with a goofy plot and some pretty girls, then watch this movie! Understandably, it has its low budget moments (especially with lighting in a few of the scenes), but it was still handled well with locations, a pretty good storyline and several funny scenes to back it up. Also, there is a music video with the actual ""band"" performing included on the DVD that is cute. This is the same group that did the GLBT movie called The Book Club."
4,not for long,As the previous reviewer stated the hose is sturdy and the threads fit the threads in the head well. They do but the threads are made of bronze or some other soft metal and I can already see them getting damaged after a few uses. This is not a shop tool this is for the car enthusiast who only occasionally checks compression. Not a bad deal at all if you don't use it often in a repair shop.
1,Mr Heater is a Loser,Nothing wrong with their products but I will have a hard time buying anything from this company which pretty much leaves you in the dark regarding the proper hose attachment for many of their portable heater products. Yes I bought this and it will gather dust while I had to wait a month and buy another attachment and regulator that can actually do the job. Always amazed at just how incompetent a company can be creating such ill will with poor communications and not including critical components in base products - Not a good experience.
5,"Like a ""lamp under a bushel""...","Without question, the quality of Anita Carter's voice is as good as it gets. There is no superlative that can adequately describe the tone and range of this marvelous singer. Until I heard this CD, and specifically her version of ""As the Sparrow Goes"", I had been more or less convinced that no other female voices could rival those of Patsy Cline, Emmylou Harris and Judy Collins. I believe now that Anita Carter belongs in that exclusive club of female vocalists whose voices are not only magnificent but utterly memorable as well. How or why she never received the recognition she deserves I will leave for others to figure out. It is enough to say that hopefully as time goes on, this lady will be appreciated not only for being a member of country music's first family, but for being one of the most gifted and versatile female voalists of all time."
3,Gives the wrong impression,"Hey, your right, Anita Carter is THE female vocalist of all time. But I was disapointed with this release. A lot of people think that this is all of the solo recordings she made. Wrong!! She made a lot more, and they were a lot better than these.Some of these songs are 5 star recordings, then some are Joan Baez style folk songs.This cd would make an essential supplement to a reissue of her more country sounding recordings.Pray that more of her recordings are released, along with the recordings of Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters. Those recordings do exist.But until more is released, this will fill the void very nicely."
4,"Great book, informative, perhaps too critical of certain....","I have seen many people attacking the Big Book of Buds as being a seed catalog in a books clothes...then saying check out cannabible. I bought the BB of B and agree, it was a glorified seed catalog...the cannabible is 1000% more informative and a more meaningful approach to reviewing the strains is explored - there is also a ton of useful info on storage, different apparatus etc - a very necessary coffee-table book for all ""users"". One aspect I found a little off in this book however were open attacks on amsterdam bud - I agree with certain points, but the book seemed to attack nether-bud and totally advocate west-coast USA bud...instead of a glorifed seed catalog, it seemed at some points like a west coast sales pitch - I've experienced the dam-stock and do not totally agree..never-the-less a great book and really, is a must have, the best book in its catagory."
4,Surprisingly well done,"Why surprising? Er, because it's a coffee table book about weed. I was expecting good photos, but the book also provides an informative and well written intro by Robert Connell Clarke (one of the foremost authorities on mj), well edited descriptions of the many strains, interesting supplementary topics from the mind of Jason King (e.g., vaporization), and excellent layout and design. And the photos are fantastic, particularly the microscopic shots. I give it four stars instead of five only because I would have liked to see more. Bring out Cannabible II, with the scratch and sniffs."
4,Eye candy for the cannabis connisseur!,"OK, so I'm not a connisseur; Heck, I'm not even sure if I spelled the word right or not! There's nothing like a beautiful hardback book with detailed colour pictures! Although this may be considered a coffee-table book by some, I've seen it as a great introduction to the history of the plant, its strains, its breeding history, the different bud highs, etc... A wonderful gift for the pothead in your life!"
5,Outstanding!,This author deserves at least five stars for his unparalleled effort! The Cannabible is a monumental work that will form the base of marijuana identification in the future. King has dedicated his life to writing about and photographing cannabis. His passion permeates every page of the book. We need more dedicated author/photographers like him. Traveling the world collecting information about an illegal plant is difficult and dangerous. King has risen to the occasion and provided great photographs and engaging text on my favorite plant. This connoisseur-quality book is a welcome addition to my library. My Cannabible II is on the way now!
5,My sweethearts dream come true!,My sweetheart just wanted a rice cooker for Christmas and this one is perfect. It is simple and does the job. It is designed so the rice paddle is attached to the unit at all times and it is easy to clean. Perfect size for 2 people.
5,Finally a real rice cooker!,I have purchased many rice cookers starting with the cheap ten dollar one to the high end cooker. The common problem was all of the steam from cooking and the spill-over mess.The Tiger Rice cooker is the perfect size for me and rice is always perfect. The steam and the mess is gone. The snap tight lid is the the reason it is so much neater than my previous rice cookers. It is worth spending just a little extra to get a great product. The rice stays hot as long as it is plugged in which makes it nice for those second helpings. It makes plenty of rice for 4-6 servings. Buy it - you'll love it.
5,Genie Dry Vac Filter 903-03,"Good product, which fits my old Genie 8-gallon unit perfectly. This filter for some reason is nearly impossible to find except on the internet, as Lowes, Home Depot etc don't stock it."
4,"heimiller, you are an idiot...",i cannot believe as i was reading through reviews of this book that i found some idiot trying to in-a-roundabout-fashion justify the murder of a (fellow american!) journalist. there is absolutely no evidence of pearl doing anything other than working as a reporter. heimiller you are a total cowardly a$$ and if i lived next to you i'd punch your teeth in for writing such nonsense.
1,A REALLY Bad Book,"The subject matter (which could have been handled so much ) is treated very poorly by this author. He has very lttle factual information -other than what was generally available to everyone, so he tried to ""stretch"" what little he had by supposition, fantasy, and make believe. It should really be classed a fiction, he has taken so many liberties with hard facts, and he uses his Jewishness as an excuse for putting words and actions into the mouth and body of Daniel Pearl. He doesn't seem to have spoken with people like Mr. Pearl's wife and the entire exercise is really so boring I couldn't finish it. I have seen this author many times on Fareed Zakaria's show ""GPS"" and always thought he was was ill-mannered, overbearing and opinionated without being well-informed, but his accent is so beautiful I gave him the benefit of the doubt... Don't waste your time with this book!"
1,Rape of consciousness,"BHL is a specialist in intox and here the rape of conscience against a backdrop of megalomania (his own).His portrait is quite rightly camped in ""Une imposture franaise"" by French journalists Nicolas Beau and Olivier Toscer where ""Who Killed Daniel Pearl"" is analyzed into its component field. There is evidence that BHL was in a physical impossibility to reach the scene of the execution of journalist Daniel Pearl and that any description of the scene is fantastic.I quote Mrs. Daniel Pearl, the widow of murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, in response to this rag overstated: Bernard-Henri Levy is a man whose ""ego destroyed intelligence.""BHL is an imposter in agreement with the Larrousse: ""a person who deceives by false appearances, which is pretending to be someone else.""Reader, do not be fooled nor accomplice."
1,Poorly written book,"Other reviews have mentioned Henri-Levy's factual errors and his self-centered approach to the Daniel Pearl case (see the review by William Dalrymple in the New York Review of Books, at http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16823), but not many mention the fact that this book is written in terrible, fractured English. I don't know if the translation was rushed or what, but it proved a major headache just following Henri-Levy's clauses back to their sources.On top of this, the book is disorganized and meandering and relies on supposition to an alarming extent. Whoo-boy is it bad."
1,Shoddy Journalism,"Poor Daniel Pearl.He certainly deserved better.Levy's volumnious tome is not, as he claims, the fruit of any enquete or romanquete but a venting of violent hatred accumulated over the years.Anyone with any knolwedge of Southeast Asia and Islam would know that Levy does'nt have a clue as to what he is talking about.To be sure, Pakistan is a nation living on the edge of danger, with a corrupt feudal elite and all the problems that the so-called developing world faces.But the Pakistan that Levy protrays is a pure product of his sick, hate-laden imagination.Levy's cloak-and-dagger narrarive in which he presents himself as a seeker of the truth facing mortal danger in Pakistan is laughable to say the least.His reportage is filled with factual errors on almost every page.Are there no fact-checkers in American publishing companies?Poor French! If this is the best that their philosophers can do...J. Sherian"
1,Rant of hatred and bigotry,The book is as noxious and odious as it is factually incorrect and intellectually dubious...Such a book would not have come as a surprise since there are always people who are more keen on spreading hatred but the fact that it is supposedly one of the bestsellers in the US and France is indeed alarming and shows how deep islamophobia has seeped into the western world..Without commenting any further on the book I would recommend the readers to a brialliant review on it in the respectable New York Review of Books of 04 Dec 2003 at:http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16823
4,Pakistan is a tinder-box state we must all watch,"The death of Daniel Pearl was a major tragedy - and it is no coincidence that it happened in Pakistan, a tinderbox state that could blow up at any moment. What makes that even more scary is that it has nuclearl weapons beyond any shadow of a doubt - some people reckon that up to 52 MILLION people could die if Pakistan and India went to war together and the conflict went nuclear. We must all hope and pray that this does not happen! So whether all Levy's conclusions are justifiable, we ought all to become much better acquainted with what is happening on the Indian Sub-Continent. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003) and WHY THE NATIONS RAGE (Rowman and Littlefield, 2002)"
3,Ok,I bought this book because I had doubts about just having one child. It talks about the environments and how lowering the population will help the planet. It also talks about studies and misconceptions about only children compared to children with siblings and the results are positive. I don't think this cemented my decision on having one child but it was an interesting book.
1,Argument Based on Fallacy,"Why did I have to even give it one star? The problem that someone should point out is that McKibben's book has as its core basis a fallacious argument. The United States, like every other developed nation is not growing because of the rate of reproduction of its population but because of immigration. If he had chosen to focus on a way to slow population growth and improve economies in the developing nations and thereby probably reduce the rate of immigration his argument would be stronger but since he didn't it doesn't matter what he says because once the core reason for his book is proven wrong, why should we believe any other argument he wishes to make?"
1,So many bad ideas in so few pages.,"I am not a pro-natalist, but the anti-birth crowd certainly miss the boat here. Compare McKibben's statistics with Simon's (The Ultimate Resource). Rigorous analysis and peer-reviewed references are lacking here.With this latest tract, McKibben proves that environmentalism is the new ""hobgoblin of little minds."""
3,Chinese New Year,"This is an old book. The information is very interesting, but the pictures aren't in color. The book with color pictures would have been rated more highly."
3,wiper arm,"good price but the arm was not splined, prob universal , but it did work after all , price is in line"
1,Disappointed,I was expecting more for my money. This seems to have been written for junior high school aged kids. It's a dud.
2,Just too hard to believe,"I am a believer in ghosts and in the fact that some people have extrasensory perception, but I just found her to be unbelievable. The places she went were well known and it would have been easy for her to know the stories before hand. It also seemed that the information came too easily to her. I just found it hard to swallow at times. For the ghost stories though, I like them, hence the two stars."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. I was not expecting to have a little excerpt of a story and a worksheet to fill in. I wanted more substance. I will use the book but I have to do a LOT of work to make it worth our while. I also think the that the author could have used more interesting selections. I don't mean to sound harsh but the other reviews were what sold me and I don't think the book is quite as good as they seem to. However, it's not a terrible book and it gives me a jumping off point to build from. Hope this helps."
1,"useful, as a last resort","I needed a back-up system for a photography trip to Galapagos. I was worried about needing to download flashdrives (2gig), in case I took so many photos I was running out of cards (shooting raw, 300 frames per drive, 3 drives). I also figured I could, as advertised, use it as an MP3 player.As an MP3 player, it's inadequate. The battery life on playback was about 2 hours, and the file system was hard to navigate when looking for songs.As a back-up medium it was barely adequate. It took about 20 minutes to empty a disk. Because one can't (or at least, from the documentation I was unable) give it a format for downloads, I had to rename the folders, once I spent another 20 minutes loading to the computer. Given the poor battery life (if I used it to store two disks, I had to charge it before downloading it to the computer), the, relatively light weight, and the slow transfer speeds, it's not really worth the money."
5,Great to see this available again!,"This is an absolutely great album that I once borrowed from the library on vinyl, but could not get for myself because it was out of print. How wonderful to see it re-released on CD! These are traditional Jewish tunes - of both Yiddish and Israeli origins -- that hearken back to the earlier, more idealistic days when Israel was just beginning to make the desert bloom. I'm ordering one right now!"
3,"not a ""Sould of Israel""","Whole CD sounds like background music to theatre/movie show. Music is putting you on the stage, but no show...Not a ""main course"" as I expected. Songs are deformed and overdramatized to fit classical music mold. I don't think one sould of Israel was involved in making of this CD.I much rather listen to Israel orchestra than to this strange 101 strings medley."
3,"The cover of this album is gorgeous, but the compositions were below my expectations! The service was fast!","I know Israel very beautiful compositions as songs Leor Chyiuchec (the light of your smile), melody of blessings, Od Lo and Ahavit Dai and Manavu, but none of them integrates this CD!"
4,It worked,We tried other things such as the fake worms. Someone suggested this product and the mole was gone within a week. I wish I would have tried the solar one.
2,Does not work on Ground Squirels,The ground squirrels are borring next to this unit. The vibration and sound does not bother them. I have put this unit in their holes and that has not worked.
2,CANNOT FIND A WAY TO GET IT INTO THE GROUND,"Don't know if this would be effective ,we cannot get it in our hard ground--it is only plastic and fragile."
3,Still hoping they work,"We received and installed our 3 mole chaser units per the instructions. We hit one of them with the mower, breaking the cover. We contacted P3 International customer service who was kind enough to send us a replacement cover. We were told by a friend that we'd have more mole activity initially -- that is certainly the case. Still hoping they chase them away permanently as happened with our friends. Have to wait and see. They've been in the ground for about 3 weeks now."
2,Engineering...or Luck?,"I am uncertain if this really does what it is INTENDED to do, even though the device itself works well. Yes, it removes moles from its *immediate* vicinity, but they will just go hide underground behind the nearest obstruction that extends underground (i.e.: trees, fences, etc.) and dig up your yard a whole lot more in the process of getting there. I imagine you could use A LOT of these...but seriously, we are talking about a 1/8 acre area with hard, compacted clay which is great for sound transmission: we should not have a problem here! I am convinced this is no different than turning up your music really loud to try and get your neighbors you don't like to move away: it doesn't always work and you may have worse consequences by doing it than if you just lived with them peacefully."
2,P3 International Mole Chaser #P7901,"I ordered two. One was DOA. Other is in the ground and seems to be doing an adequate job, but it could be that they are flushing the gophers out for my cat, who nailed 3 in one night. ""good boy!"" I'd like to give this more time and will do follow up in a month."
1,Not a great performance,I purchasd 6 mole chasers and tested 2 mole chasers for two weeks. The results were not great and I still have the moles/gophers coming two feet away from the chaser. I'm going to try the Exhart Mole mover since they have a good reviews.
2,I think the moles are thinkin' its dance music or something.,"I have placed two of these devices about 25 feet apart in a heavily torn up area. I rolled the previous damage down to make mowing easier once again and they are back in that area again after two weeks. I put new batteries in them and buried them using a shovel and stomping in around the stakes, but I guess its dance or tunneling music to our moles. Perhaps it just takes a bit longer."
2,Chasing Dreams.....,"The product documentation claims it takes several days for the sound emitted from the Mole Chaser to chase the buggers away....well 21 days and counting and Mr. Mole is still dinimg on my garden. Take my advise, buy the poison and save yourself from wasting money on the Molechaser!"
1,Gopher Chasers - do not buy,Don't waste your money on these Gopher Chasers - they DO NOT work at all and is a complete waste of money!!!! I had them in my yard for at least 6 months and the Gophers could not come in the yard fast enough.
1,Does not do the job it claims to do,"After 20 days my moles continue digging happily all around this so called mole chaser; they do not seem affected or bothered at all by it, let alone being chased out.If you ask me, it was a waste of money and I should have listened to guys who left low ratings for it. I am just way too lazy to send it back and most likely will just throw it in the garbage where it belongs.I would like to see a unit working for those who left high ratings since I am puzzled by their claim. Either their moles are more sensitive, or something is wrong with their observations."
2,The mole man (still) cometh,The moles in my yard didn't seem to take any notice of these devices at all. I used 2 in an attempt to drive moles away from my storage shed to no avail. The devices did emit their sound for over 2 months on one set of batteries...but unfortunately had no effect on the moles.
3,Sonic P3,It works in my soil for about a 7' radius. That is as close as the MOLES will get. So the 2 that I have are spaced 12' apart. My soil is very dense and damp. The item is very tight in its hole. I suspect soil type could determine success or failure of this product.
1,"Saw it on TV, bought it on the phone, got it in the mail, it was a piece of ...","These were my final step ""pre"" doing the Bill Murray / Caddy shack approach to getting rid of my gophers. Put several in the front yard, several in the back, and waited for results ... they didn't come ... The gophers would literally burrow up next to them, chuckle at such a preposterous notion, and head off their merry way leaving tic tac trails through my gardens everywhere. Let's face it, the only way to get rid of these guys is to face that it can't be done. Castor pellets / spray works relatively well if you do it often enough / at least once a month ... I've had ""Clark Pest Control"" in for almost a year now and I may as well have been spending my money on ""insert derogatory word here"" (complete waste of money) ... All they do is use a tool you can buy at Home Depot for $25 to insert poison pellets in to the gopher burrow ... All in all ... forget buying any kind of product that uses this technology."
3,Worked on chimunks but not on moles,"I bought this because I had a chipmunk (ground squirrel) problem. I tried other things like spray repelants but they did not work on chipmunks. This product chased away the chipmunks but then moles moved in after the chipmunks left. The moles seem uneffected by this product. I have to use the spray repelant for the moles (the spray repelants have work in the past on moles). In conclusion, this worked on my chipmunk problem but not my mole problem"
1,Not working Yet!,"I Purchased the P3 P7901 Mole Chaser and put it in the ground just like the instructions said. It doesn't stay on all the time. Have to go shake the top of it 2 or 3 times a week. Chipmunks have made new holes, right next to it. I am not impressed with this item at all. Save your money."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought two to cover a decent sized yard, but was very disappointed.I gave it months to work, and for a brief time I thought that these were working, but the moles kept coming and the mole holes kept popping up.Eventually the ground froze and I had to take them up as indicated in the instructions. I'll try them again in the Spring, but so far I'm just a little mad at the amount that I've spent on batteries.On still evenings I did hear the chirping of the steaks, even from inside the house, but that wasn't enough to give it a negative review. I do live overseas, and that might be a contributing factor?? Perhaps these Eastern European moles are more resilient than their US Counterparts.But overall I'm just disappointed that they didn't seem to help at all. In fact, if it didn't sound paranoid, I'd swear that it actually attracted more moles to the yard..."
2,Mole Chaser - doesn't work,"I bought 2 of these for a fairly small front yard, about 50ft by 50ft. Installed the first one 2 weeks ago. The moles built a new outlet about 12 ft from the mole chaser. I then installed the second one about 25 ft from the first one last weekend. The moles built another outlet about 2ft from their other hole and about half way between the 2 mole chasers. I am going to leave them in operation to see if they will drive the moles off. Right now, I am skeptical that the mole chasers will do any better than they have done so far."
2,Don't think it works,I purchased several for my first house and I thought they chased the moles to the neighbors yards. On my second house it had no effect and the moles even dug around it and even dug up a couple. Don't waste your money.
3,Mole chaser,After I used all the 'D' cell batteries in the house (8) I dug holes less than 25' apart & placed the units in the yard. 1 seems to be working. The other seems to have had NO EFFECT on that darn little critter. Scalped my lawn/trails w/the lawn mower. At this rate I'll have to install 6 more!
1,NOISY PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"This device has not helped the situation one bit. The gophers have left me dirt piles 2 feet away from it. I don't know why they call it a mole chaser, unless that's because it only works on moles. All I got to say is ""hold on to your money"", this is just a noisy piece of junk."
1,Not efficient,I installed this chaser a week ago and today i saw a gopher who made more holes 20 inches from the chaser.
1,Fun while it lasted,Maybe I got a bad copy or something but after awhile my city would stall no matter how hard I tried booting quality of life or lowering pollution. Really lacking in memory and nothing like the PC version of yesteryear. I ended up selling it after a while.
2,Difficult and Challenging.,"I have to say, the game's graphics are nothing short of cheap. But besides that fact, the game is cool and all, except you have limited creativity. I got stuck many times trying to figure out what to do, or how to do things. The tutorial was of limited help when it came to the real gameplay. I struggled and eventually just gave up, never to play again. I hope to sell it soon."
2,boring,this game was so boring and it took forever to get anywhere. you have to start off building a city and then you have to wait for that city to grow. and wait and wait and wait and thaeres not much you can do to speed up the time you pretty much can jsut set the game down and run a couple miles and come back and see if anything happend. not a very fun game
4,SimTown not SimCity,"Well maybe not quite, this mini version plays like the SimCities of old but gets very annoying when people keep ""barging into the mayor's office"" to complain about this and that. Its almost every 10 minutes. Else this game plays like the full scale version (with a few bizzare and pointless mini-games)"
2,Should have bought the PC version instead.,I am sure the game does exactly what it is supposed to do. But I bought it for my sons birthday and he lost interest after 1 day. I tried it out and it is kind of boring plus you can hardly see what you are trying to create.
2,Not that impressed,"My daughter and I were so excited to get this game on the DS. We play Sims City 4 all the time on our PC. Unfortunately, we were really disappointed with the DS version, probably since we are so used to the interface and features of SC 4. I understand this is more like playing Sim City 3000, which I didn't play.We found it hard to make the city and the city is hard to see on the screen. You can't cut through the zones to make new roads - at least I haven't figured out how. I also don't like that you can only make one city at a time. You have to erase the city to start a different one. We are used to making 5 or more cities at one time on the SC4 - I guess we got spoiled. But if you are trying to share the game with another person, you would really need 2 games since you would probably each want your own city. At least that is what I was hoping for. I know the DS limits the options, but I was really disappointed with this game."
1,blah,"I didn't think the game was much fun at all. In fact, I tried to return it the next day and ended up having to take a cheap trade-in on it because I wanted to get rid of it so badly. The back of the case made it sound exciting (""save your city from fire!"" turned out to mean, ""rebuild the city afterwards"" etc) and i was really disappointed. I also had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do anything. I guess i was expecting it to be more like other games I'd played in the past, such as Sim Hospital and Sim Theme Park."
5,From Fly Creek,"I found Jim Atwell's book FROM FLY CREEK a delightful read.Jim Atwell's sense of humor, insightfulnes, and intelligence shine through this collection of newspaper columns. Jim's love of animals and all people is a true celebration of life.Shirley HallAnnapolis, Maryland"
5,Wonderful find,"This is a quiet, funny and enjoyable collection of essays about why slowing down and smelling the roses has tremendous payback. I highly recommend it."
5,Illustrated Guide to the Human Body,If you wish to help young children 7 yrs and up to understand and appreciate the human body this book will help them.
2,"Not what I expected, but okay","I thought I was getting the item pictured, a recent publication. However I got a 35 year old book which probably has about the same information, but not nearly as attractive as I was expecting. I will use it rather than worry about sending it back. A bit disappointed."
5,A must for any serious Carr collector,"This book should be on every serious Carr collectors bookshelf. It's full of buxom beauties, swordsmanship, history, and ""fair play."""
5,A Sephardic Journey,"I LOVE this DVD set !!! Yitzhak Navon is charming, friendly, knowledgeable and just plain entertaining in this three-disc set, which covers the ""basics"" of Sephardic life on the Iberian Peninsula before, during and since the dark days of the Spanish Inquisition.If you are at all interested in Sephardic history, get this set. You won't be disappointed.I do have one caution for viewers; there is nudity on the first and third discs (topless women), so beware if you are offended, and/or watching with children. Otherwise, ENJOY !!"
2,Hashed out Again Fanatics VS Sweet Gay Couple,"This story has been hashed out more then once; nothing original just another Afternoon TV Drama about religious fanatics out to get the sweet Gay Couple next door, sadly it's something you'd expect to see on the True Movies Channel. I found it difficult to sit through it...tired subject matter with an outrageous ending. If you like Afternoon Television, you might like this movie - it was a no brainer."
2,And These Are Magic Beans...,"I really tried to like this movie. The premise piqued my interest and it had some known actors, so I thought what the heck. Soon to wed gay couple are menaced when a religious hate-monger (played very effectively by Chris Donella) moves next door. One of the gay guys is found dead and all fingers point to the religious zealot.That's all I'll reveal about the plot. What transpires next is a movie that feels it has a lot to say--on a subject that needs in-depth discussion--but get mired down by unbelievable twists and turns which turns this movie MUTE. Most of the characters introduced in this movie are so transparent you can see through them like used Neutrogena.The filmmakers may have thought they hit a bullseye with their movie, but they were way off target. I would not recommend it."
4,Better Than Expected,A gay couple is living in a suburban Dallas neighborhood. They get new neighbors who are homophobic. The acting in this movie is excellent. The story keeps the viewer watching. The movie also takes unexpected twists and turns. The lead is very good looking and the character development is good. I would have just liked the movie to be a little longer; it was an hour and a half. It was a great movie overall.
4,Good film that touches on all emotions,"By the time all is said and done, the viewer is presented with a moral dilemma with the characters you want to love and the characters you want to hate. Definitely didn't see the end coming. The video was worth it and was more than what I expected from information on its web site."
3,A Little Too Pat,"This movie may be a little too pat a morality play about homophobia. The haters appear to be too one-dimensionally villainous; and the hated appear to be too one-dimensionally admirable. There is even a lovable pet thrown into the mix to wring our hearts on cue. And tragedy strikes with a predictable knell.However, the plot takes an interesting turn or two. There is some suspense and some detective work involved. And the movie does bring home the lesson that no good can come of blind hatred.Overall, this is a worthwhile film."
5,BEST COUGH DROPS. Wish they were available.,"These are the best for reducing coughs during a common cold illness, and reducing irritation. More effective than all the competing cough-drops and lozenges I've tried over the years. And the taste was good too.I purchased these in the past from a local store, but now cannot find anywhere, unfortunately. I hope they've not been discontinued."
5,Stunning,"Riveting plot, excellent Oxford setting, superb acting and music. I was not expecting anything like this fine a production! Thanks!"
4,fun mystery.,"Just a good old fashion mystery. Fun to watch, nothing great but good. I rented it from amazon streaming. worth it to me."
5,Really enjoyed the movie,"Have the entire Inspector Morse boxed set (yeah, the $400 wooden box one), and all 5 seasons of Lewis. I wasn't sure how I'd react to ""Endeavor"" but at $15.00 I was willing to give it a go. Glad I did. Thought they did a great job and I almost cried at the end when he looks in the rear view mirror. Great job!"
5,Shaun Evans - GREAT JOB!,What a great background story for how the Inspector started and the inside scoop (some) about his quirks ... personality traits and characteristics we all have ...
4,Nice Intro,"This prequel to the Inspector Morse series does a bang up job of portraying the young Endeavour as he finds his place in life. We see him develop in his chosen career path, and the car mirror premonition at the end of the film is priceless!"
5,Endeavour,"I heard that they have picked up the series for one season, which usually means three to four episodes and I will love it."
4,Enjoyable,"I loved the Inspector Lewis series: the storylines, leads, and settings were terribly appealing. When I finished the series I wanted more, but found Inspector Morse too gritty and unkind for my current frame of mind. I stumbled upon Endevour and found it charming. Morse is both fleshed out and played well, and even if the viewer is unacquainted with his older self--the story of not only a murder but a young man's character development and how he learns his craft is charming and highly entertaining. I can hardly wait for more."
5,Fantastic!,Really enjoyed this movie. Made me an inspector Morse fan! A must see for fans of Masterpiece Mystrey fans. highly recommended
3,"Not as good as the ""older"" Morse series","I bought this from Amazon.co.uk (region 2) because it was cheaper (less than $12, shipping included). The focus is on young Morse; as a result the other characters and the plot are not fully developed. The whole thing is sketchy and you are left to work out the details for yourself. Also, the movie lasts only 98 minutes, not 120 as listed on Amazon.com. Interesting because of Morse, but I would not buy more of the same."
4,for morse fans this is a good one.,This like 'george gently' takes place in 1965. And it transports you back to the beginning of inspector morses careet. We get to see him in his frist case when he was just a new person on the force. The quality is excellent and this does show the start of the hugely popular character. The dvd looks great too.
4,A must for any Morse fan,"I am a big fan of the series Morse. Endeavour attempts to trace Morse's beginnings to show and explain why, in later life, he acts the way he does. While many fans did not appreciate this Masterpiece Mystery, I found it to be a very good show. You have to make your own decision, but in either case, this is a god show and worth watching."
4,Surprising twists and turns one would expect of a good mystery,"Having been an intellectual suffering from questions about the meaning of existence and my place in society, it was easy to identify with the detective and his angst. Often we don't realize we have special abilities until there is a synchronous twist of fate which requires our response. This is such a story and is definitely bittersweet on many levels. I highly recommend it. The acting is good, although the supporting actors could have been better. That would have made this an excellent storytelling experience."
5,Utterly fascinating,"With no exposure to the Inspector Morse novels or tv series, or to its successor Inspector Lewis, I watched this for the sake of actor Roger Allam. I was captivated by the unfamiliar Shaun Evans' performance as young DC Endeavour Morse, teetotaller, opera lover, crossword solver. Seeing Allam as Morse's DI, Thursday, was a pleasure, but it's watching young Morse that's the point (along with the glorious displays of Oxford, of course). How does this skinny, self-contained young man become the irascible white-haired magister? If this is, as I think, the launch of a new series, I'll be eager to find out."
3,"Masterpiece Mystery, Endeavour","Being a fan of the Inspector Morse Series, I found this beginnings of a young Morse very likeable, so much so that I do hope there is more to follow in future. If you like Inspector Morse, you will love this"
4,A pleasant surprise for Morse fans,I watched this on OPB and was pleasantly suprised. I was a devout fan of the late John Thaw (as Morse and also as Cavanaugh so I was not too sure about this. I thought it was well done and enjoyed the connections to the later Morse we knew and loved.
4,Lila Spaulding,The packaging was good as always and it did get here on time- I alwasy like to see the smile on the box --- That meanssomething new is here. The movie was good I like the mystery movies as you can tell. thank you again. L.S.
5,Surprisingly Great Photographs,"I have never been a devotee of photojournalism. Not for any of the ethical reason, but simply because the quality of most photojournalism I have seen is quite poor. There have been a number of exceptions, and this book is full of them.It is astonishing to me that these photographers managed to create such beautiful images during the horror of war. I am speaking apart from subject matter, which too often gets in the way of any meaningful discussion about the particualr merits of a photograph. Yes, the subject matter is horrific, but the images themselves are incredible. Being a photographer myself, I am aware of the skill required to create a meaningful image. These artists who crawled over Southeast Asia with their Leicas created images that many other photographers without the added burden of imminent danger, have not. END"
1,Still defective,"... All the pictures of American soldiers show the Vietnamese cowering away from them, being hurt by them, being horribly wounded, etc. All the pictures of the communist soldiers show them being brave. The written stuff by Halberstam and Sheehan is their same old same old blame America first. And you wonder why I think this book is dishonest and that photojournalists deserve no glory. Take a good look at the close ups of the American GIs, the ones here there faces fill the whole page, and look at the exhaustion and determination and fear and courage mixed in their eyes, and tell me again how great journaists are... And all my veteran friends have had the same reaction to this book...how about ONE picture, just ONE, of a medical aid team helping villagers, a soldier receiving a medal, a picture showing pride...never happen. I continue to think that this book is selective propaganda for the wrong side and fully deserves the ""1"" I gave it."
2,"Inadequate, narcissistic and mis-focused","A book in which photojournalists congratulate photojournalists for being photojournalists. Narcissistic pap. The authors forget that those who record the activities and work of others are engaged, at best, in a derivative effort. Far too much attention is paid to these inflated egos already; the lowliest private with a rifle did more for the peoples of Indochina than these Ur-yuppies in pursuit of glamorous careers. Pass and buy Stewart O'Nan's The Names of the Dead instead. signed, Vietnam Veteran (1968-69)"
4,"Little new, but worth having","If you've already got both of Mencken's Chrestomathies, his Prejudices series, Newspaper Days, Heathen Days, Treatise on the Gods, and The American Language, this book will be mostly gratuitous. Otherwise, it's a good collection of his opinions, and opinionated he certainly was. It also includes his introduction to The American Democrat by James Fenimore Cooper, various magazine articles (including two published just before his stroke), and some previously unpublished letters.The major value in Mencken's writings is that he thought outside of the mainstream. I share his views more often than not, but even when I disagree with him, he makes me think."
5,Survival of consciousness : Life after Death,"Three cheers for Gary and his research staff!This book is a magnificent introduction into the unknown realms of consciousness.This information is a must for anyone who is developing their quantum mind. Gary's ongoing research will open new dimensions for us all.The 21st century will be the ""birthing"" time as we carry our conscious Selves into the new awakened quantum state of awareness."
3,Did not connect with the universe.,"These two authors appear to be educated, both having PhDs. I liked the writing style and the composition of the book, namely the placing of reference books and authors in the text of the story as well as at the end. However, there lacked something in the book that did not lend realism to their hypothesis. It was a book that can be read to give one another view of the world and the hereafter, but it does not address the reality of what might exist. The information in the book is far below that of PhD writings. I bought the book expecting more than I got and I can see why used books are so much less than those that are new. I would not recommend this book, unless you can pick it up for 50 cents at a book sale."
5,Schwartz and Russek's Work Takes Science to a Higher Level,"This brilliantly articulated, provocative work is both entertaining and informative. The authors boldly traverse new ground that makes this work a watershed, and leaves the reader hungry to see further applications of the Universal Living Memory Theory, especially regarding the issue of survival of human consciousness and the tests now being performed under Schwartz and Russek's watchful eyes at the Human Energy Systems Lab.This book is a gift to humanity."
2,"Sweeping Conclusions, nort science","The Author claims to be a scientist (and anyone with a science degree from a university can claim), but I am afraid his personal quest has gotten in the way. The author makes sweeping conclusions from data that can be observed in the natural world, and then because of a faulty logic and false deduction, introduces us to the absolute reality of mediums, angels, guides, etc, without a real proof. It has some interesting ideas if you know where to look."
1,Unnecessarily Vulgar,"Shrake's story is interesting, but to compare this to Lonesome Dove is a serious mistake. While I think his portrayal of a a brutal time in a dangerous land is probably right on, his narration of the events sounds like something out of a Penthouse Forum. I don't mind the characters speaking in a vulgar way, but for the narrator to choose words that are clearly unneeded to develop the story is really too bad. I was disgusted for the last time within 100 pages of starting it and proceeded to do something I have never done - threw the book in the airport trashcan. Stick with Lonesome Dove - or Gates of the Alamo."
3,Somewhat disappointing; not a bad book though,"This book came highly-recommended by fellow native Texans and I had read the reviews placing it among Texas classics. I think many are searching too hard for the next legendary Western story.Shrake lays out a setting that seems to have great potential for an exciting Texas novel. His descriptions of pre-statehood Texas are beautiful and will have any reader constantly imagining what it must have been like living in Texas when it had few laws and fewer boundaries. But in the end, the book falls short of an epic Texas story as the battle scenes are often short and hardly captivating. If one begins this book by discarding the hype, they will probably come away with a better opinion of it than I had."
1,This is not Comanche Moon,"Contrary to the dust jacket hype, Bud Shrake's writing does not compare favorably to McMurtry. While having an interesting plot for fans of Texas history, the use of telepathy and a yeti as plot devices is not very convincing (nor was the ghost of Deets by McMurtry). Sloppy editing is also apparent in several places, especially when the climactic confrontation of the two main protagonists at the end of the book just fizzles out to nothing.I really hoped for better."
1,Only has 19 games,This is not what the cover says it is. There are only 19 games on this product. Very disappointed with this software.
2,"Mahjohngg Is Okay, Solitaire Is Not","The mahjongg games are playable and work pretty well, although a lot of the tile selections are useless (e.g., the tiles are so similar it's difficult to differentiate them).However, the solitaire games are nearly unplayable, both from a visual standpoint and in the way the games themselves work. It's so bad that at one point, I had to reinstall the game, and I left out the solitaire module."
1,Does not fit iAudio 9,"I ordered this hoping that it would work with my iAudio 9. The product description is sketchy, so I wasn't sure whether whether it would work or not. As it turns out, it didn't."
4,Might be needed for Windows 7 users,"It seems that I can no longer charge my iAudio 7 from my home PC after migrating it to Windows 7. Issuing a ""stop device"" command is supposed to switch the Cowon from 'USB Device' mode to charging mode, but with Windows 7 it doesn't do this. I highlight the Cowon and select ""Eject"" but it never goes to charging mode, it just stays on ""Connected"".So apparently my options are: make sure I keep at least one computer on Windows XP, or buy this AC adapter. I think I'll go with the adapter."
3,Amazing Calendar is pretty Amazing,"I started using Amazing Calendar Maker in 2003. I've never noticed it putting spyware on my computer. Panda Anti-Virus said nothing detected on the disk.I use this program every week at least a few times. The only problem is that you cannot save the file you create as anything other than *.cfl, a proprietary file extension. Therefore you can only print the calendar through Amazing Calendar Maker. You also cannot print it any larger than slightly short of 8"" on the short side.Otherwise, I love it."
3,Remembering Eritrea's Struggle for Independence,"This work is a clear account of how the Eritrean people stood up for freedom and great personal cost. It recounts the amazing story of their resiliency in the face of great odds, their innovation, and their love for freedom and independence that finally led to a free country. The story provides a compelling understanding of why the Eritrean people and government today are determined to find their own pathway into the future instead of turning over control to another countries vision for their future."
1,Don't bother with 2nd edition,"Not a bad book in itself, but the ""revised & updated"" 2nd edition is just the first edition with some very minor notes added a few times to the last part of the book. It has the same number of pages as, and is essentially identical to, the first edition. To describe it as ""revised and updated"" as it does on the cover is quite deceptive. So if you already have this book don't bother getting the 2nd edition, it's a complete rip off as it adds next to nothing."
2,"Excellent 1st edition, rip off in the 2nd","I was enchanted by the first edition and since have played Pirc regularly. Unfortunately, it is already outdated so I have jumped on 2nd revised and updated edition. Unfortunately, it is a complete disappointment, almost nothing new and even what's is new it merely says something like ""there is a new move which changes the assessment of the position. You have to improve somewhere earlier"". Rip Off. Black list Alburt :). Chernin was not involved in 2nd edition."
3,"Detailed coverage but lacks ""good book"" value.",This is probably a very good book. I have tried on many occasions to learn more about the Pirc by studying this book. It has great ideas. I just thought it was very verbose and lacked instructional value. I gave it three stars for the potential is has. I will use my Botterill book instead.
1,Cosmi=spyware!,Do not buy this or any Cosmi or Starshine software. It installs Spyware on your computer and it will take an expert to get rid of it. Don't make the same mistake I did!
4,very inspiring,"I really enjoyed the ""13 Senses"" though not as much as some of Villasenor's other books. It is a great story about the author's parents when they were in the first years of marriage. I really enjoyed the descriptions of the time period and how things have both changed and not changed through the years. This book actually gives me some real hope during this time of economic manipulation by the powers that be. It sounds like the Great Depression was similar in its cause and manipulation by the rich. The reason for the 4 stars for a book I really enjoyed was the bothersome exclamation points and capitalization used to such a degree!!! I picked a page and counted 33 exclamation points on just this one page with some capitalized words thrown in. If you enjoy history, study of religion, study of Mexico or California or a good love story, this is your book."
3,Repetitivo,"A mi parecer Villaseñor es repetitivo en su forma de describir los sentimientos de sus protagonistas. Prefiero ""Lluvia de Oro"" que esta historia, y si... también lo prefiero leer en Español."
2,very disappointing,I was so excited to read this book because i LOVED Rain of Gold. It almost didn't seem written by the same person. The conversations seemed very forced and I was pretty much bored to tears. Very sad. But do read Rain of Gold. It was great!
5,Villasenor has done it again!,"I am a big fan of Victor Villasenor's literature. He has such a style that is serious but can make you laugh out loud. In Thirteen Senses, it starts where Rain of Gold left off. The boo chronicles the first few years of Lupe and Juan Salvadors marriage. This book is very intertaining and a delight to know that these events actually took place. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
2,frantic and disappointing,"I really looked forward to reading this book. I had read Rain of Gold in Spanish, and actually I read this one in Spanish too. Mamma mia! I have never read a book with so many exclamation marks. All the bolded phrases about Papito Dios etc became quite annoying as time went on. The story related in this book was also tedious and silly. I'm sure his parents were great- the photos are the best part of the book- but I began skimming about halfway through because I couldn't bear the hysterical and preachy tone anymore. Sorry!"
2,Doesn't Deserve the High Marks,"With all due respect to the author, I found this to be one of the least helpful books I've read on perfectionism and related concepts. While I appreciate the author's sincerety and efforts, the work reminded me of a nice and fluffy John Gray book. In a nutshell: not much meat, not that well written, and not especially insightful. It lacked sound logic and clarity. Much of it didn't ring true to me. I don't think it deserves the high marks."
5,Got shade? Get this book!,"There are two reasons to buy this book:First, it's a great guide, reference and philoshophical perspective on how to garden successfully in the shade. Having gardened in the sun, I was frustrated with the dense shade on the lot around our home. I love trees, but I missed the sun! This book opened my eyes to a way of looking at shade and gardening successfully with it.Second, this is one of the most beautiful books I've ever owned. Ken Druce's photography and the book's production quality is top of the line. Even if you don't have shade, if you enjoy books on gardening, this is one to add to your collection."
3,"Not really a ""gardening book""","I have a shady garden and bought this book expecting some good information as well as inspiration.I must say the photos are all indeed beautiful and pretty inspiring. But this is not a book you would consult for gardening information. For example, it doesn't even tell you the hardiness zones for the plants cited. I for one, am glad I knew that Hostas will not grow in California, but I'm pretty sure a lot of beginners out there will get excited on plants they can't even grow.I would say this is an absolutely beautiful ""coffee table book"", but not really a ""gardening book""."
3,"It's okay, but not for beginners","I got this book based on the very high ratings posted here. I think the book is OK, but very difficult to read (lots of boring lists of plant variants, for example), and targeted to a much more sophisticated gardener than I am. I like Druse's philosophy tremendously, but need a few more years of gardening under my belt before I can really make use of much of what he says.The photography is beautiful."
4,Beautiful Shade Garden book,"We have a shady, sloped yard in Texas which is highly unusual for this part of Texas. This means we usually can't grow many of the plants that most people in our community do. So, my husband and I went to the bookstore and found this book. There were others on shade gardening, but this had the best photography. The publisher obviously used high-quality printing techniques on this book to get the vivid color. So, this makes just a beautiful book to look at. I used to feel a little disappointed that our yard was so shaded (except that it's cooler in the hot Texas sun than others!), but when I saw this book I realized we could make it into quite a gem.I will admit that I am a novice gardener, but I found this book inspiring with lots of ideas for plants that we could use in the shade. I am not sorry that I spent $40 on this book!"
5,Great deal,"The product arrived quickly and as described. A great price, cheaper than our security provider was going to charge us."
3,"A terrific book for Doc fans, but...","""Doc Savage: Arch Enemy of Evil"" is an essential reference guide for any true Doc fan -- it features the pulp magazine/paperback covers and a capsule synopsis of each story, plus some great essays. Unfortunately the price is rather steep for such a slim volume... Were it priced at fifteen bucks or so I'd rate it worthy of another star (or two)."
5,perfect,Item was exactly as described. Works great if you have stiff fenders and makes you sit accurately. Way worth 24.99 :)
5,Great guide for parents of twins,"Being the mother of twins, I am glad to read a book that lets me see what is happening inside the twin relationship. My twins are often in their own world and this book has helped me see what it's like in there! ""Dancing Naked"" is very informative, yet entertaining. I think all parents of twins should read it - - you'll learn some surprising things about twins."
3,tiny,"yeah, i read the product details, saw the dimensions, even used a tape measure to estimate how it would look in the litter box area...still a little unimpressed. the deep grooves contain the litter very well, and it comes right off when i tilt it back into the box, but for the area it covers, it doesn't do the best job. i'd almost suggest getting two of these."
2,Where's the beef?,"This ""book"" is 61 small pages. Adler reports that the court's decision is inconsistent with an earlier opinion by Scalia and opines that the decision violates ""separation of powers"". That's about all you'll find; little about the decisions of the lower courts, the arguments, the dissents, how the court came to vote the way it did. Poor value."
1,"An article; not a ""book""","I have read and own each of Ms. Adler's books. Each book - previous to this sham - provides an engaging, thoughtful experience by one of the best thinkers and writers in America.I thought I was getting a good, detailed look at the genuine issues and context of the 2000 election--the kind of work the author did on the CBS/ Westmoreland case or even what Alan Dershowitz did in his book on the case or what Richard Posner wrote in his book on the Clinton impeachment. This is an extended letter to the editor dressed up on the web to look like a book; it belongs rather in a collection of the author's freelance articles."
3,A real good time!,"It's a nice album. If you really like to meet the Samba, the real one, as it is played in the favelas you shall buy this album. It's a modern music, keeping the roots. I think at the same time, if you like bossa-nova it's very interesting to hear this album. If you know Bebel Gilberto's work, with the drum'n'bass, you will feel disturbed, in a good way, with this CD. I bought and I kept it."
1,Very dull video,I purchased this video for my nephew and as we sat down to watch it I was shocked that it was so inappropriate for small children. I was led to believe this video was geared for children and boy was I wrong. It's all about paleantologists searching for dinosaur bones. I am very disappointed and feel it was a very big waste of money! I wish there was a way to return it.
4,Great for older kids,"I would like to add a few words to the previous comments regarding this video. It is not going to interest most very young children. But it is an excellent video that introduces children to the science behind dinosaurs, and allows them to see how people can work with dinosaurs and fossils. And some younger kids may enjoy it. My own son is not quite three, and he loves the video. He even knows the names of some of the featured paleontologists, and he wants to work in a museum when he grows up."
2,let down,"What a total let down. Should have expected the documentary format based on the National Geographic name. However, the title and links led me to believe otherwise. My husband and I like it, but not being the dinosaur fans my 3 year old is, another shelf life video."
1,Professor,"Very poor text, with mistakes in several problem solutions and equations. I wouldn't reccommend it for structural analysis classes"
1,Structural Analysis,"Very poor text. Illustrations are very plain. Many of the example problems simply contain formulas with no real explanation of how and where they are used. Much of the ""in between"" steps that are essential for a student to learn the material are left out! The book is also short on verbal explainations. Chapter 5 on shear and moment diagrams is awful. I had to refer back to a strength of materials book for shear and moment diagrams. Come on guys, put a little more effort into the small details next time. Many more STEP BY STEP examples are needed in this text."
1,structural analysis,"Extremely poor text. The example problems use formulas that come ""from out of the blue"" with no explanation of how to apply them to the situation. The explanations of how to solve the problems are totally inadequate. To a student, this text would be absolutely useless, and may cause many potential structural engineers to pursue other avenues of study. Absolutely should not be used by any professor for teaching structural engineering to students!!"
1,No good,"This is a very poor text for structural analysis. The examples are absolutely terrible. Luckily I have a decent professor who explains what is going on. Also, there are several mistakes throughout the text and I often found myself refering to my Strengths books to help with the shear and moment diagrams, and beam deflection because this book did a horrible job explaining those topics. I highly recommend you use a supplementary text along with this if you are using this book for a structural class. -M."
3,Flawed in my opinion,"Although in most respects it's more convenient to use the intdividual as the unit of natural selection and it works fine, in cases of conflict between the individual and the gene, the argument must yield to gene logic. (Dawkins is right on genes, mistaken on memes, see Atran's In Gods We Trust). Mayr argues because of pleiostropy and polygenetics among other things, that the unit of selection has to be the phenotype (i.e. the individual), but I disagree with his conclusion. How does natural selection work over the millenium on phenotypes? Natural selection is slow and statistical. How could it change anything on an organism that lives a relatively short life span. Sure, many of the genes are hidden from it because it only 'sees' the phenotype, that's probably why there's so many by-products of adaptations, what Gould calls 'spandrels'. If there are hidden genes that work well with the selected genes, they will become the by-products of the adaptation, in my opinion."
2,An article of faith,"I looked to this book to present for me the best case supporting the theory of evolution. In fairness, I did not read the whole book. But, by the first page of chapter 2, ""Evidence for Evolution,"" was this phrase: ""Given the fact of evolution..."". It went on to make apologies for the fossil record evidence being spotty in its support of the theory. I was surprised that a Harvard scholar would write in such a way. Accepting a theory as fact is no way to prove a theory."
5,A Nice Overview for the Educated Layperson,"Mayr treats the following topics:-history of evolutionary thought-modern synthesis (incorporation of major biological disciplines into the darwinain fold, a process in which he was a principal agent)-prokaryote/eukaryote evolution theory-overview of phylogenesis of major phyla (esp. animalia)-speciation, species stability mechanisms (mayr is the world's formost authority in this area)-role of regulatory genes in stabilizing upper phyla-species concept/taxon/type-macroevolution (whales/horses/birds/mammals)-hominid evolutionalso, mayr has no trouble indicating ideas he disagrees with, or considers wrong-headed, crusty old deutschman that he is :). he tolerates eldridge & gould, but trashes dawkins at every turn.to summarize, a reader with a bit of biological study as background is presented with a fairly sophisticated, yet approachable, survey of the most important evolutionary concepts, all in a volume about an inch thick. not too shabby at all."
2,Difficult to Read,"As many other reviewers on Amazon have stated, the nomenclature is a little too much to handle for the laymen interested in evolution."
2,A mile wide and an inch deep,"I was a little disappointed in this book. Though directed toward the educated layman, Mayr here writes in a manner that only biologists would find easy to understand. At the same time, he covers so much material that many interesting topics only get a page or so of attention. There isn't much detail that a reader capable of getting much from his writing style would not already be familiar with.There are many problems with this book that a good editor should have brought to Mayr's attention. Mayr often mentions a specific case in passing, saying that X property of evolution is displayed by Y animal, but fails to cite clearly his reasons and source. So what's the point of mentioning the example if it's not explained how it relates to the topic being discussed? Where can I find more information? I found this book frustrating and tedious, and I learned little from it that I didn't already know."
1,disappointing,"Mayr should have stopped (writing) when he was ahead. This was a very disappointing book. It's not that it needed better editing, which it did, but it needed better writing to begin with. Far too many ideas and narrative directions are addressed in very general, almost trivial, ways, leaving the reader feeling like he or she has only just begin to skate across the surface of ""what evolution is."" And it's not a very smooth or fun surface."
4,Brief but comprehensive,"Mayr is able to condense in a very small book, most of the areas of evolution. It suffers a little bit because of that(mainly if you have a knowledge more than the basics of evolution), but you have to realize that this is not a book for advance reader. It is for the illuminated basic science reader, that wants to expand their knowledge of this topic. From that standpoint, it's excellent. The authoritary tone that Mayr imparts to his writing is a little bit gratting if you know that some of the discussions that he closes up as resolved are not really that defined, but again if you are not a specialist it's good to have somebody telling you that X or Y is definitive.In conclussion 5 stars as a beginner's book, and 3 as a general one."
2,Did Mayr author this book?,"Ernst Mayr's reputation is such that we expect writings of only the highest quality. This book is disjointed, patronizing, and written professedly for the educated layman but with jargon and explanations that only a specialist would understand.What is unnerving is the lecture mode that the writer uses, asking questions and then answering them as a neophyte would do with his first book.Mayr ""wrote"" this book last year when he was 97 years old. I cheered for him as the poster boy for many of us elderly. His preface he seemingly wrote--it's clear. But his secret may be out when in his Acknowledgements he thanks the three people who ""prepared the manuscript"" and contributed in other ways."
4,Men's Soccer Sandal,"I wear a lot of soccer sandals during the summertime around the pool. This sandal is a little stiff when new, but will soften up after break-in. Looks good and has very good arch support."
3,short,"This book does give an alright over view of the war, however it lacks any meat. The only battle that has any depth is tsushima. The land battles were not described very well, and it was hard to see what tactics led to sucess or failure. The book is good for information, or if your writing a paper, but not a whole lot of content for the military historian. The author does explain some of the flaws of the rusian army, and some of the after effects of the war, however the book seems to be too short for anything more. The book also was a little on the dull side."
4,Good intro to this conflict,This book is a good introduction to this conflict for its 96 page length. Not very in-depth but for 96 pages what can you expect. If you are looking to get up to speed on this conflict in about 90 minutes of reading this book is excellent.
2,Could have been better...,"While the story flows well in this mystery, why have so much filthy language and so many detailed sexual scenarios? If the author is trying for authenticity in dialogue, this is fiction and seeing the ""F-word"" and other ""curse words"" every other page is jarring and unnecessary, and not representative of most people. It doesn't further the story and offers readers an uncomfortable place to be in throughout the book. Some of the characters are interesting, but continually reading about ""sleazy"" people feels like work instead of pleasure. I have read one other Maggody book, but if this had been my first I wouldn't have read another. And many of these fictional Southern characters really make Southerners look bad, resembling the often-used negative stereotypical portrayals that those who don't live in the South like to perpetuate. This book excels at that. A good writer, but some maturity would help the work."
3,Better information on New Order than Joy Division.,"I have listened to Joy Division since before Ian Curtis died, have all the original vinyl, etc., and I must say I was a little disappointed in this book. The New Order coverage is pretty good, but I picked up the book more for Joy Division. Both bands' names appear on the cover, yet the J.D. coverage ends on p.38 of a 127 page book! What information there is on Joy Division is good, although the author has a habit of interpreting lyrics and claiming to know exactly what they meant without explaining whether he's speaking his own opinion or has information to back him up. In closing, I would recommend this book only for New Order fans looking for a little more ""Insight"" into Joy Division. For Joy Division fans, I recommend looking at one of the other Joy Division books."
4,Packard Book,Collectors information book. Seventeen more words required??? 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17
5,exactly as it looks and fits the dog in the picture,"i really love the store and the suit for my dog. it fit him exactly as it looked in the picture and on the other dog.the only thing when i washed it, it turned into a fuzz ball. but the suit looked great, my baby was able to run, hop, roll, crawl around in it with no problem. he looked so hot. i got my monies worth and i am happy"
3,NEED NAME OF MUSIC please,I ask if anyone knows what music is playing at the house of the asian guy when jimmy finds him dead siting in the sofa??ThanksThe movie is ok.
5,Unbelievable playing and continuity,"The whole set is well worth the money and highly recommended. This is some of the best playing in my collection. The group continuity is amazing and the soloing is virtuosic and inspired as expected. This DVD along with the ""Three Quartets Band"" recording in the box set I just couldn't stop watching/listening... but they are all good so buy the whole set.Chick's skill are [if I didn't see it myself] just unbelievable. True effortless mastery."
4,"As an Alaskan, this book leaves nothing out.......","I thought this book was complete and easy to follow, A must for anyone who wants to hunt Alaska"
5,A must for anyone considering Alaska hunting.,"This is the most comprehensive book about Alaska hunting out there. Chris Batin is an authority on Alaska hunting and does a good job of educating you in detail on the particular species you may want to hunt. After reading, if you are truly serious about planning a hunting trip in Alaska, I suggest a consultation with Chris too as he knows the guides and the areas. And no, I don't have any affiliation with Chris whatsoever other than reading his book and speaking with him on the phone afterwards."
5,"The Original Was Great (Multi-Player was Awesome), This One Tops it (ON-LINE Multi-Player)","OK, so I was a big fan of the original. It was a fun way to kill some time at the gym, or waiting in line for a movie, or on a trip in the car. And if you had a friend with a PSP, even better! The two of you could mix it up for even more fun. Now, with Warrior's Code, they take it a step further. If you're at the gym, and you can tap into an unsecured line, or if you're away on business, and the hotel has free wireless, or even when you're at home on your own wireless network, you can link up with other players that have access to a wireless network. OK, so did I also mention the fact that while playing a linked game through two separate wireless neworks, there was no apparent slow down? Now that's impressive. I don't know how they were able to get everything to play so flawlessly in a linked game, but I like. Oh, and the single player game is a lot of fun, too."
2,Sucky game with expensive price,This game does not worth $39.99. It plays like Diablo. Boring and boring and boring.
3,depends on your taste,"i got this book to compare her style vs the colefax & fowler style. But my taste has switch to modern & minimalist ie john pawson since i got this book. So i dont find it as interesting..the more interesting question is whether old-money look will come back. If so, then this book may help rehash it w/ more contemporary vision of old money"
1,Franklin has poor notification policies,On Dec. 7 I ordered a Franklin Dallas Cowboys youth uniform... plenty of time for Christmas. They never gave notification that the item was out of stock until Dec. 20. I had no time to purchase a new one for Christmas. The one item that my 6 year old wanted never came.
3,heinously dry,"a lot of this album sounds like second-rate electro jazz; it seems quite uninspired, and more than just a little bland. the songs are trance-inducing, but not in a good way: i was sent into a kind of dense, stupid trance. this cd is relaxing, but the repetition gets to be a little overt: just a warning. i'll turn to Boards or the Squarepusher for true innovation."
5,The cd is awesome,Daddy Yankee is da bomb. I love this cd. I've played the cd soo much I'm tired of it now. You must add this cd to your collection. The way he raps to all of the songs with the beats is soo crazy! This cd is a A+.
1,basura!!!!!!!!!!!!! no lo compres!!!!!,"definitivamente este disco es una basura despues de tanto tiempo sin lanzar una nueva produccion discografica Daddy Yankee nos trae este CD cual no es ni la mitad de lo ke se esperaba de el. el disco solo tiene 2 canciones buenas y son la de ella me levanto y la ke tiene con Akon mas nada el resto es mas de lo mismo y pensar ke con este disco ia a revolucionar el regeaton pues se le hundio el barco a su disco.me da lastima de ke el como artista no pueda hacer algo bien buena musica como Barrio Fino y no piense solo en $$$ ahora despues de su One Hit Wonder.mi recomendacion es no tires tu dinero a la basura mejor bajalo por internet de gratis o compralo en la calle pirateado ya ke no vale la pena gastar mas de 5 dolares por un disco ke tengas ke darle a skip a tantas canciones.Mejor comprate el disco de Wisin & Yandel ""Los Extraterrestres"" este si es un disco bueno mucho material buena musica y mejores canciones aparte de ke este disco trae de todo y esta mejor."
3,Otro Mercado,"Definitivamente esta producción está dirigida al mercado Gringo y no al Latino. Es una desición de Yankee. No esta mal, pero no me deslumbra."
1,THE BIG CRAP,I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS ALBUM I HEARD THE SINGLE IMPACTO AND SAID O.K NOT BAD BUT IN THIS ALBUM DADDY TRIES TO CROSS OVER TOO MUCH THIS SOUNDS LIKE A AMERICAN RAPPER TRYING TO DO REGGAETON HE SHOULD OF DONE WHAT HE DOES BEST AND KEEP IT REAL THE FANS WILL COME YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE DON OMAR DID IT NOW YOU
4,The Big Boss,"I am a Daddy Yankee fan, and considering the region of the country that I live in I will probaly never see him in concert unless I specifically travel to New York. So when I saw there was a dvd of MTV's $2 dollar bill concert, I purchased this cd/dvd. The interview was good, it was in English, and the concert footage was enjoyable, but I pulled up the concert on youtube and there were some highlights of this concert that I wish were included on this dvd. For example, a violinist played while he sang ""Corazones"", and I liked "" Lo que paso paso"". These highlights were not included and I wish they were. The dvd was only about 33 minutes long, I wish it were longer, but I was happy with the dvd. I already had most of the music from the cd, so I did not listen to the cd, he has other music that I like better than this cd. All in all, I liked it."
3,got what I payed for,"I bought this as a gag gift for girlfriend, Who doesn't need an ""evil-eye"" bracelet now and then? Its worth $15 dollars, but very delicate.The green is as deplorable as it looks, thats half the fun!!"
4,Heartbreaking,"I purchased this book because I am ghostwriting a story about polio. My client's 14-year-old twin siblings died from polio in the 1950s. She was 12 at the time and it devastated their family. I wanted more background information and this book provided it for me. Truly, truly heartbreaking on so many levels. Great photos and bios."
2,It ain't necessarily so!,"25 years after the Tlatelolco tragedy, Luis González de Alba, then jailed and interviewed in prison by Poniatowska, said she ought to make several amendments to her now-classic book to make it more historically accurate and less militantly oriented. Turns out to be, Poniatowska credited many others for things González de Alba told her in his cell. He thought that was O.K. then for propaganda reasons, but now history demanded a more straightforward approach.What happened next? Poniatowska resigned her seat in NEXOS magazine -where González de Alba writes- and threatened to do the same thing to La Jornada, Mexico City's main leftist paper, unless they sacked him on the spot, which they promptly did.So, all that talk about freedom and liberty and tolerance and stuff you read in the book has to be taken with a big grain of salt, since it seems the author can't even take one single comment, not to mention a critic!"
3,Nice but lacks a lot of helpful info.,"I thought this book would be helpful in ""celebrating personal style"" - It doesn't. It celebrates some very nice but very expensive traditional or theme weddings. These weddings also seem to have limitless budgets (e.g. spare no expense last minute change of venue to the groom's family estate in the south of France).Simply put, This is a very nice picture album. Nice pictures, nice cover.NICE. Not helpful! Very little info and advice. If you want planning, dress ideas, favor/craft how-to's, time and money saving ideas this is not that book."
3,not as expected,"i expected this book to have better ideas and tips, but i was surprised with the modest level of creativity it contains"
3,An okay fantasy novel,This was a very basic fantasy but was not a bad one. The environment was unique and the characters were adequately described. It is a rated PG-13 novel of Adrian Cole`s. A Place Among the Fallen was a much better piece of his though.
2,Uncomfortable grip,"I purchased this item hoping it would resolve my difficulty in being able to write with an assistive device. I have severe neuropathy in my hands. You have to grip this hand aid with all four fingers and your thumb. Gripping with my thumb caused marked discomfort, thus preventing me from using this aid."
1,Don't buy this.,"I bought this ... at a local store, just wanting a basic chess game to play around with. Boy, am I sorry I bought it. The graphics are terrible, and there is an annoying intro to the game that you can't avoid. It looks like it was made in about 1990."
1,ditto,"Just a terrible game. I was looking for a cheap chess game as well. The graphics are absolutely awful. However, the game itself has no depth. Nice waste of $10."
1,I did not receive the Item,I have received his Request for review and I have not received the CD!!! I would like to know if I will receive it or not
1,Not worth 91.00/UNHAPPY w/PURCHASE,"I bought this item because it looked nice. Was very excited to get, took it out of the box and put it together. The plastic cylinder didn't fit.There was a chip on it. I expected walnut and received black, Looks are deceiving. Please do not waste your money. I won't return it because its more of a hassle to return then buy."
2,Over Priced,"I was really disappointed with the overall quality of this lamp. It's made out of cheap wood with plastic semi-circular covers that are somewhat difficult to install during construction and/or if you have to change out a light bulb. The base never fit together correctly. Despite my efforts, I never got the lamp to stand up straight so the lamp always slanted slightly to one side. The only reason I kept it was that I had paid so much for it ($100+) and because it was hidden behind a 6-foot folding floor shade and was never seen by visitors. All that said, it did last me 5-6 years until a short finally made me not trust it anymore and I threw it out. For the money I would recommend buying something else."
4,a masterpiece with lack of adrenaline,"Ocean is a real mindblowing album but something is missing. I have always prefered ""Dawn"" or ""Power and Passion"" albums. But still, Ocean is one of the best concept albums ever made."
4,Highly Informative,"I weighed into this book on the basis of an article I read about Panarchy. Some of the text is too technical for me (all the chapters are written by academics) so I confess that I skipped some parts. Nonetheless for anyone who is trying to grasp how change happens in our world, this is an outstanding source for understanding the complexities and inter-relatedness of everything."
1,Perfect Attorney Platinum riddled with errors,"Go to the Nevada Living Will and print the form. You will see the grave lack of quality this program has. It is riddled with spelling errors, misplaced words and problems. If something happened to you and your relatives looked at this living will, they would most likely be left just scratching their heads. This is a terrible program."
1,Dreadfully limited and poorly written,"It's a templating software with very simple string substitution and some very poorly written, limited templates. Their legal documents don't contain special versions with local law alterations. There are numerous errors in the template, often leading to a string not getting added into the appropriate place.It doesn't provide any way to itemize entries on the forms at all as well. I wish I had a way of returning this dreck."
1,I hate these crayons,"I don't get it. These crayons are terrible. You have to press SO hard to see anything. The pink is practically white, even when I am pressing with all of my grown-up muscles. My little guy is constantly frustrated by them and gives up coloring all together. He prefers opening and closing the box. They don't break, so I guess that's a plus, but what's the point if they never get used? Also, I don't think the triangular shape is all that comfortable to hold. These crayons suck. I wish I'd never bought them. This is the only product I have ever hated enough to bother writing a review for."
5,More durable than other crayons,"These are great crayons for young toddlers as they are harder to break. Not impossible to break, but harder. They're not as creamy with the dreamy colors that Crayola has, but for this age, they are safer. They are not dog proof though as we found out...we lost one that way."
3,Eh - I expected more,"Well I guess I'm one of the few who's not entirely pleased with these crayons.I got them so that my 4 year old could play with ""colors"" and my 2 year old could observe and try his hand at the fun. What ultimately happened was my 4 year old complained that he could not make any color show up on the paper (because of the bearing-down factor) and my 2 year old was not at all interested when he saw that big bro wasn't into it.Honestly, I typically love Melissa & Doug products so I'm pretty disappointed in these crayons that really should be sold as colored pencils instead.Don't think I will be recommending these to friends, sorry Melissa & Doug. :/"
5,Long lasting crayons,"Large size for smaller children, very durable and long lasting, nice colors, just great crayons! The best part: they do not break easily!I gave a few as presents, and hear back very positive comments."
4,Crayons for Toddlers,"These crayons are a good size, and relatively sturdy. They are actually made of fine plastic, so only mark when pressed quite hard. A few have broken, but it doesn't deter my son from using the stubs."
3,The colors aren't true,"My only complaint about these crayons is that some of the colors are not true. The red is actually red-orange. I was very surprised that none of the reviews mentioned this fact, so I thought I should. Otherwise, they are much stronger than Crayola crayons and my daughter enjoys putting them back in the case so they are much easier to keep up with."
3,Durable but difficult to use,"I bought these crayons based on other customer reviews. While I agree with everyone's comments that these are very durable crayons, it takes a LOT of force to get substantial color. That is certainly not helpful when you have a young toddler just learning to scribble and color. It is frustrating for her when she is coloring with these and barely sees anything come out on the paper. In contrast, we have some jumbo size Crayola crayons, which are also pretty durable, and the color of those is much brighter, more vivid, and easily shows up on paper when my toddler uses them. Perhaps these crayons are fine for older kids but for those that are really young, I suggest Crayola instead."
4,We LOVE these!,"I bought these for my 3 year old son to use to color his new cardboard playhouse. I wasn't really sure how I would like them as all we have ever had is the basic Crayola crayons. I really like these! I love the fact that they are triangular and don't roll. I love that they aren't wrapped in paper (nothing for the kids to peel off & shred), I like the little case they came in and overall, I think they color well. I also think they are just *little* heavier duty than typical Crayola ""fat"" crayon, and thus a little less breakable. I would highly recommend these for anyone with toddlers!"
3,not so clear,"MY Baby loves to hold this but the mark is not so clear so she looses interest pretty fast. Otherwise its a good product and i love that it does not have a paper covering, which my baby would have ate long time ago!"
5,My 18 month old actually tries to draw with these,"Completely agree with other reviewers. These crayons must not taste very good, because my 18 month old son actually tries to draw with them instead of chewing on them (I can't give him crayolas because he will not take them out of his mouth!) These feel pretty sturdy, nice size for the little hands and nice bright colours too, maybe except pink, which is quite light. He also loves taking them out of the box and then fitting them back into their slots :) Highly recommend!"
5,SENT THIS AS A GIFT,"I never actually saw this product, but the person I sent it to just loved it. It was for my little niece and her mother saw how much she loved it."
2,NOT washable!,"While these are sturdier than the crayola variety, if you have a toddler who likes to color on AND off the paper, these do not wipe up with a washcloth like crayolas do. Wish I had known before purchasing, now we only get these out occasionally."
5,"Durable, great color, last forever","I LOVE these crayons. I thought the triangular shape was a little strange, at first - but then I realized, they don't roll away! I bought these for my son, for his 2nd birthday. They're super easy for him to hold and use and he used them A LOT. I mean A LOT. He went through several (Melissa & Doug) drawing pads, scribbled like mad and yet, 4 months later, these crayons have barely worn down. I wouldn't be surprised if they last a whole year. He also drops them all the time and they haven't broken. They don't really seem to need sharpening, either? In any case, if they do finally wear down, I'll definitely buy more."
4,Love these crayons. Don't love the case.,"My daughter (13 months) loves these crayons. Any mention of coloring and she will race over to where they are stored and point at them until you get them down for her. I put down theJaq Jaq Bird Eco-friendly Splat Mat, Owlssince she colors WAY outside the lines. I thought she was going to have difficulty pressing down hard enough, but she took to them right away. The only complaint I have is that the storage case doesn't shut smoothly. It catches on something and spills the crayons out every time you open and shut it which is annoying. Other than that I love them."
3,Not a favorite,"My twin g'daughters (five years old) seem to prefer their usual and customary crayons. Still, they were a hit for awhile. I, however, appreciate the fact that these crayons don't roll!! Thanks!!"
2,"This is not a ""definitive book"" of cosmology.","I have been waiting for one month to read this book and I was disapointed. It was advertised that the book was a State-of-The -Art of cosmology and in my opinion it was not,it is a recollection of articles that have been published before,most of the articles are not updated and forty percent of them are not illustrated,and the ones that are illustrated are of poor quality and they ara black and white, there are some colored pictures in the center of the book that are not enougt to make up the deficiences in the rest of the book.I advice the readers interested in cosmology to read the book of Edward Harrison, Cosmology:the science of the universe."
2,Nice cover but...,"The book fails to offer a comprehensive perspective and is certainly not the definitive work described in the publisher's promo. The ""S.A. Book of the Cosmos"" is neither up to date nor does it provide a coherent retrospective view. It flits about from topic to topic and leaves important questions unanswered. In my opinion, there are far better books on cosmology for the casually interested reader: Look for titles by Harrison, Gribbon, Davies, Guth, and Thorne."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this stroller!!,"I bought this stroller for my 2 year old on the internet and would have never bought it had i seen it in person. I was hoping to get a light weight sturdy stroller that would last until my daughter didnt need it anymore. Instead the stroller is ""mushy"" when you push it and it is extremely hard to steer and handles terrible on all but the smoothest surfaces. It is almost impossible to get up curbs and even turning corners is difficult. It feels like the entire stroller is going to fall apart. In addtion, this stroller isnt made for people over 5' 7''. I am 5' 9'' and the handle is too short my poor husband who is 6' 3'' has to nearly bend over to push it. It is a poorly designed and made product and i wouldnt waste your time or money on it."
3,its ok.,"Its an ok product. given the chance i probably will not buy it again. i bought it because i liked the design,portability, weight and basket at the bottom. Ofcourse being able to steer it was an absolute nescessity. Thats precisely why i am giving it a 3 stars. it has all the above things except easy steering. my son weighs 38 pounds...but when he sitting in it i have to push with tremendous ammount of effort. if i am going straight i have to apply extra force for it to turn. its really an effort to drive this stroller. my mother in law cannot push/carry heavy things and this has been a big dissappointment since she starts to ache while pushing this stroller.I had a $10 umbrella stroller before this one and i am really not sure if there is a difference between them. Even that one didnt require this much force as well."
1,"It looks cute!, but don't be fooled!","if you need a stroller for everyday use, this is not it. I use it everyday and the wheels have worn out, the safety harness is too big, and can't be adjusted, my daughter weighs 25 pound and I feel its going to break soon, I have had it for 4 months and I wish I had bought another stroller, so not worth the money."
1,Bob's,"I am sure that I will enjoy the games, if IO can get them installed, But They Are Not Compatible with Windows 7. Please tell me how to install the program. Thank you."
3,not received well,"This item was received in a box with no padding around the item itself and the box was torn and crushed. The item did have some damage when received, but does still work."
3,A modern-day version of the Jane Austin classic,"In Persuading Annie, author Melissa Nathan has paid homage to Jane Austen's classic novel Persuasion with not only her title but also her cast of characters. Annie, a young, motherless college student from a wealthy family, is persuaded to reconsider her plans to elope with her college sweetheart, Jake, by her interfering stepmother. Seven years later, Annie is still unhappily single, and the family business is rapidly going downhill. Re-enter Jake, a business consultant, to not only save the family but possibly Annie as well.Although Nathan mirrors Austen's style of using chance encounters, misunderstandings, and various group outings to futher the plot, her writing lacks Austen's wit as well as its unique charm. This leaves the reader with a very average, somewhat amusing boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story which ultimately fails to live up to the classic novel which inspired it."
2,Unlikeable Annie..,"I liked Melissa Nathan's other books, particularily Pride..Jasmine Field, but this one was hard to like. Primarily because Annie was such a drip-no backbone whatsoever. Furthermore she stayed a drip till the very end. Her sisters were selfish twits which would have been okay if they provided comic relief. Unfortunately, not. The other characters were two-dimensional and also, not entertaining."
2,Slow...,"I picked up this book because I generally enjoy these re-dos of Jane Austen's work. But this one doesn't hit the mark in any way: it's slow, it's boring, and hard to finish. I just never sensed the emotion or passion between the hero and heroine and the result is that one just plain doesn't care. Stylistically, there is a lot of ""head-hopping"" which one doesn't see that often and which was interesting to read; but in fact it is a bit confusing and my conclusion was that I don't need to read this style again. In all, this was a disappointing read."
2,Lots of gurgle about kiddies and babies,"Pick up most romance novels today, and most of them have the Almighty baby shoehorned at the end of the book, as proof of the Couples Luv for each other. With this story, they turned up on every other page. Do yourself a favor and read the original 'Persuasion'. Unless you want to read about how exasperating kids are (even in the womb), but how worth it they always are. Only thing I did like when the heroine would go off by herself in the city, that made good reading."
3,Not the best blade.,I bought this blade and i wasnt totally impressed. it is very unstable especially after it does its jumping attack. i am fairly new to beyblade and i also bought a kid dragoon which always seemed to beat this trygle. if i were you i would take out the spring if you are going to buy this.
4,TRYGLE..,"This beyblade isnt worth your time or money! I brought this beyblade 1 week ago and it's already broke. I used this and battled with my sister's Galleon, and Trygle lasted 5 seconds before jumping up and out of the arena... This beyblade might seem cool but if you want a beyblade that jumps, I suggest you get a jumping driger.. Also don't get a Trypio either. This attack ring is to big and with one hit its easily knocked off balance! A pretty good choice would be a metal dranzer!"
5,"Scholarly, Readable, Excellent Biography","Bremer has brought us a sensitive and balanced portrayal of Winthrop, one that is at the same time truly gripping. One of the significant contributions of the book is Bremer's attention to Winthrop's forty or so years in England prior to coming to New England, which helps create the sense of organic development and shows points of continuity between English Puritanism and that of the New England colonies. The relationship between Bremer's presentation and other scholarly opinions is covered in many of the endnotes, which makes it useful to the scholar but not burdensome for the average reader. Scholars, history buffs, and even those just interested in the human experience of life, will find this book rewarding. Highly recommended."
5,Suprisingly Great,"Again, having just read the previous comments from a reader in Tennessee, I have to wonder if we're reading the same modules. Everything about A Darkness Gathering is wonderfully great, including the way it manages to weave together 4 sub-adventures that can be played in any order (how un-linear can you get?). Better yet, the players' exploits in one sub-adventure affects the play of the others: A ""haunted"" sewer, a thief-infested warehouse, a wizard's tower, and a secret illithid Cyst are well rendered, and better yet, really well written. Really, this module is one of TSR's better offerings, ever, especially when brought together when Master's of Eternal Night and Dawn of the Overmind. I would be seriously interested in how this module could have been made any better, and that's why I give it 5 stars, the best!"
1,too much ugly,"no no it's the worst album by electric universe,too boring and the rhythm is too acid, j remember the right sound of them as unify or divine design but this album is decidedly monotony without sound only obsessive rhythm."
1,Just Be Warned,"I'm sure the other reviewer enjoyed every minute of this CD, but if you've come to this offering by searching for a specific song, be aware that these are NOT the original hit renditions but, instead, remakes done some years later (with as many of the original group members as possible). Those who remember the songs when they first came out in 1956 will recognize instantly, for example, that that is NOT Tony Williams doing the lead on The Platters' My Prayer."
3,Needs to be updated for current exams,"This was one of my resources when I did the exam prior to the changes made earlier this year to the certification and accreditaion professional (CAP) exam. This book needs to be updated to reflect the changes in the exam. Even before the exam changes, the book helped with understanding how C&A is viewed from another person's perspective which may not always be what is practiced. The best preparation for the CAP exam is to be knowledgeable of the various NIST guidelines - SP 800-53, 30, etc. and have a good C&A background to rely on."
2,This CD Dissapointed me and i love CONFLICT!,"Their older material...(time to see who's who & increase the pressure) are 100 times better, if you are a fan of conflict you may like this. It dosent sound raw, or heartfelt or underground at all, it almost dosent even sound punk! They add some ska to their sound??? I dont know i just like the old conflict more....just my taste. I was dissapointed."
1,worthless,"Narrow and biased, it focuses on a narrow aspect of china-some of the IT players that David Sheff met by accident.Boring, newspaper style writing stretched over 200 pages. Mr. Sheff simply can't write. He would not hold your attention if he had a gun to your head.Don't waste your time."
5,Mandatory Reading Required,"As one involved in this struggle over the last 25 years I agree this book is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to learn about the struggles related to accessibility. Congressman Edward J. Markey, Ranking Democrat, House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, stated, ""Telecommunications technology can enable and ennoble the lives of millions, but only if our laws animate such technologies with human values to ensure universal access and inclusion. Karen Pelz Strauss, a tireless ally in expanding disability access to new technologies, presents a wonderful history about the inexorable march of innovation and the ongoing struggles to bring its wonders to all sectors of society."" Former FCC Chairman William Kenard noted, ""The lessons revealed in the pages of this book offer a compelling roadmap to those who are willing to take up this challenge in the decades to come."" I am glad the author took the time to capture the struggle so others can learn."
3,Right tool for the job,"This is a good combo for the avg. homeowner, it allows you to use the right tool for the right job."
4,It works.,It helped me to understand the wooden dummy better. If your a guy like me that lives in the middle of no where with no King-Fu schools with in a 100 miles or more in the area you live. This will help a lot for beginners.
2,Too complicated to use,"Waaay too complicated to use. Manual is written by engineers for engineers. I tried hard to use it, but unsuccessfully. Nobody is around to tutor you. Yamaha has no idea what a WX5 wind controller is."
1,Not enough information,"I'm sure that the instrument is everything the other reviewers have stated but for someone just getting started, there is little information about what is actually required to create sound! One reviewer tried to fill in the blanks but was hoping that the ad itself would be more explicit."
2,fair,"I was diappointted in the size and the durabilty of this item. It is more of a colletors item, then a ""toy"""
4,Not an action figure,"If you think these are action figures, they are not and if you think they are 100% metal they are not. Now the detail of the mini statues are really cool they are about 3"" tall great for any collector or optimus fan"
2,Cheap and falling apart easily when my seven year old son try playing and tranforming it. Cheap!!!,Cheap and falling apart easily when my seven year old son try playing and tranforming it. Cheap!!!
1,No audio channels,"This is like one of my favorite movies. I always check out discs I get, and after all these years, I got a dud. No audio. And frankly the video doesn't come across as 1080P. For the price, it's not worth returning. Performed checks with some of my other movies, and no problem. Oh, well, out $13.00. Could be worst."
2,False advertising,"I remember when this came out on video, I was managing a video store and expanding my reading of military history out of WWII and into other areas- Korea, Vietnam, WWI, etc. Hoping for a high-quality film of the battle of Heartbreak Ridge in Korea. Ended up with made-for-tv feel of boot camp, and then the dramatic climax in.....Grenada. Yep, Grenada. Admittedly, that's all they had to work with, but still I get the feeling that Clint would like to forget this movie more than I would. That being said, if you just want to see some really accurate uniforms and a few war-movie cliche characters, by all means invest your time. For a better time, check out the 1959 movie ""Pork Chop Hill"" produced and directed by Gregory Peck. Although full of heavy-handed evil godless commie sterotype imagery, still much better than this one here."
3,"Wow, this movie really hates gay people.","No one in the platoon cares that Profile is dead,lolThey don't even bother to bring back his body in a flag draped coffin, these guys suck!"
4,"Great Movie, but most wont appreciate it","This movie is kinda like an inside joke. If you weren't in the Marine Corps you might miss some of the more subtle humor. Clint Eastwood does a great job portraying one of those Motivator, Hard Charger types. The Lieutenant is another great stereotyped character. He's got that nerdy, book-smart character perfected. Overall, the characters are developed and believable. The so called training exercises and tactics are all wrong but I can forgive that sort of thing in a low budget movie. Overall, the plot is weak but compensated by the strengh of the characters. I think most people that were in the military will like it, not sure about everyone else."
4,Poor by Clint's high standards but,"Along with The Rookie its probably the worst film Clint Eastwood ever directed. However I've given it 4 stars because it IS hugely entertaining and even though he was 56 when this was made Clint looks great in the role.The film is too long at 125mins, but for the first hour and a half you will get to see and hear Clint deliver some classic lines. He spits and chews people out. I also think this is the first film where Clint used that gruff voice that has subsequently become a trademark, reaching its zenith in Gran Torino where simply growls at people!The plot such that it is needs no explaining, there is a love story and its a classic re-working of films like Full Metal Jacket and the Dirty Dozen. Its not as good as those, although it is a little tongue in cheek where they are not, but it has Clint Eastwood in it, and that is reason enough to see it. A living legend."
2,quality issues,The movie content was great but the down streaming issues ruined it!Frequent stops and starts and the images were blurry.
4,Pretty Good,The product arrived very quickly but about 3/4 of the way through it will randomly pause. No other movies do that on my system so im curious as to what is causing it. otherwise good price and fast shipping.
3,Heartbreak Ridge,"I typically like Clint Eastwood movies . This one is no exception. I enjoyed this broken down war horse namely, Eastwood acting as the almost retired plotoon leader and getting a bunch of misfits ready to become real marines against the wishes of the commander of the regiment.This so called commander referred to his unit as the new Marine corps."
5,evohnav is an ...,"You are wrong. It was Marines, not the piddling army, that inveded Grenada. You are thinking of Panama. Second, the Marines GySgt Highway was in charge of were NOT recruits. They were RECON MARINES. Get it right or get out. This is a good war movie and Marines everywhere love it. So what if it was originally going to be an army movie. This movie, at times, shows the spirit of the United States Marine Corps, the finest fighting force on the planet. Nobody has anything on the Corps."
3,Clint Slipped...,"I've always enjoyed Clint but, considering the amount of control he had over the production, this one surprised me. The lines were predictable, the conduct of the trainees was unrealixtic and Marine Mario Van Peebles being allowed to wear a huge earring while training was just too much. Soft-spoken Eastwood wasn't right for the role of a drill instuctor. In the future Clint needs to speak less, as in the Dirty Harry or western movies, and let co-stars play the roles that demand shouting to make the movie realistic."
4,AMarine Movie,Anybody who has been a US Marine will want this movie. Clint is at his best as a battle hardend Top Sgt.
3,Suspend reality and enjoy the show!,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie every time I see it, but I have to suspend reality during the show. Is there a former or present member of any branch of the armed forces who doesn't look at the ribbons on the uniform? Imagine Mario Van Peebles as not just a Marine, but a member of Force Recon meeting a Gunnery Seargeant on a Greyhound bus and not noticing the Powder Blue one with stars on Gunny Highway's top row of fruit salad. Take it one step further and imagine a gung-ho USNA grad Major who would bad mouth someone who had earned the CMH. I bristle when they use the expression ""won"" as opposed to ""earned"", but that's another story. Never mind that flaw and about a thousand others. You will enjoy this for its humanity if for nothing else."
4,"very real acton, perfect cast","Clint Eastwood presents another fine example of his acting abilities. An ageing gunnery sgt. who is trying to find his place in a younger, newer military. The kind of movie you can watch over and over."
4,Heartbreak ridge,"i thought was good defence us students in the invation of grenada, all though advicing artilary from a cell phone sound out of reality the builup frpm a strange kind of reconacense team from the marines adds up as well as the final break out between the unit and the commander who tries to put the awards for him but theres is always the fair good film i had it since vhs dvd & now upgraded to blue ray"
4,"""Heartbreak Ridge"" DVD",I didn't need to know anything more thaN I already knew from previously seeing the movie on cable TV. I pruchased the DVD from Amazon.com to give as a gift to a retired U.S Marine Corps officer friend who has not yet seen the movie.
3,This doesn't mean we're gonna be swappin' spit in the shower,"I suppose Clint Eastwood should apologize for this not being a flag-waving, everybody-wins rah-rah flick. I, for one, think its a pretty enjoyable flick, though certainly no masterpiece. Eastwood is great as the ""Gunny"", with some terrifically vulgar dialogue which no one but him would be able to deliver properly. Oh, and for the reviewer bitching about the platoon calling in air support through their home base in the States via telephone on the island, it DID happen, during the invasion of Grenada, I believe, due to radio failure that left Marines cut off from their support."
2,fair,"Now I see whyUnforgivenand the Eastwood work actor and director since is rightly considered such a renaissance. Heartbreak Ridge encapsluates every negative stereoype about Eastwood that saddled him before 1992 when Unforgiven arrivedEastwood acting is fine here as a hard boiled marine, but the writing is cliche, you could be watching a Chuck Norris flick. The serviceman encounters the hippy and the new gaurd officer, all with predicible sarcasim. So what.Eastwood had done far more nuanced work before--Dirty Harry and a lot of the Leone westerns--and it is disappointing to see the master working so far below his capacity.But also kind of fun. Seeing this now shows you how much Eastwood redefined homself in the 1990s, making morally complex films that define him as one of the best in cinema."
3,Heartbreak transfer!,"I was excited to received this Blu-ray in the mail. This was Clint Eastwood in his macho military role and all his dry humor. I saw it when it first came out and always remembered it as one of his memorable role as an American hero.But, afterI watching this disc, I was sooooooo dissappointed!It was such a bad transfer. I don't think any restoration was done before the transfer. In fact, I think its the same DVD transfer except into a Blu- ray disc. The sound is not bad but the picture left much to be desired.I was very dissappointed. Shame on you Warner Bros!!!!"
4,"""IF THIS DOESN'T KILL US, IT WILL SURELY BREAK OUR HEARTS,""","Is the legend behind Hill 931, Korea, 1951, according to this fierce Clint Eastwood tale. USMC Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Highway is Eastwood's most interesting character since Harry Callahan: mangled flesh, voice as raw as a wound, sarcastic and crude, considering he has the CMH won at Heartbreak Ridge. HEARTBREAK RIDGE could have been a throw away drive-in cliche fest, instead it's a great lesson of how pride changes attitudes. Only a great film veteran like Clint could get that much mileage out of the invasion of Grenada. I think the film is longer than the actual combat activities."
3,Enjoyable mostly due to Clint's solid performance,"Heartbreak Ridge really isn't that great a film, but it is enjoyable, and I do give it three stars, mostly because of Clint's solid performance as the veteran Marine gunnery sergeant. This is really the first role in which Clint shows his age, which has increasingly been part of his personna (notably in Unforgiven and his recent True Crime and Blood Work, where his screen character roughly approximates his own age, afflicted with the foibles of old age). Marsha Mason is very good as Clint's ex-wife, and Mario Van Peebles is fine as the young corporal who both lionizes and seeks to outfox the old sergeant.A must-see for all Eastwood fans."
4,"Stereotyped, but enjoyable","This movie is so over-the-top it's very enjoyable. To me, anyway. I haven't been in the army (or the marines) and I'm fortunate enough to live in a country that hasn't been at war for decades.Therefore, from my neutral point of view, I have really had a great time watching this movie. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of Gunnery-Sergeant Highway is overdone, and therefore a treat to watch. Also, catch Everett McGill as Major Powers, absolutely unlikable in this part. Always thought he was a great actor!This movie has something in common with ""Full Metal Jacket"". Both movies start off on one foot and seem to end on another. The bad part about this is both movies start off better than they end. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, I really do. But I always seem to loose interest in it after the training-part comes to finish, and end up switching the movie off after about an hour. And I suppose it's for good reasons."
3,Movie is great Prime instant video not so,I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if it had streamed properly. However the film kept stopping in the middle and kept getting out of sync.
5,My son LOVES Diego,"My son loves Diego, so anything Diego is a big hit. I love the stories because they encourage my son to think and problem solve. Diego is into wildlife rescue and the stories teach facts about different wildlife found in Central and South America and teaches the need for conservation. My only complaint would be that there aren't enough Diego books and toys. Dora gets all the limelight. Don't forget the boys!"
4,"Very, Very Good, But Not Great...","Being an avid Football fan, Total Football is a dream come true. It gives me fast reference to players and their statistics, positions, high schools, and even hometowns. However, there is one glitch that keeps popping up. After referencing through the book many times, i finally realized that a player must have played in a game in order to have been given credit for being involved in football that year. Therefore, a player could have been not played in a game, or sat out the season on injured reserve, and the book does not give him credit for playing at all. If a player was on a team's roster, but missed the year because of an injury, that should be noted. With the way Total Football is, I wouldn't know if a player was injured for the year, on the roster but didn't see action, or just sat out the year. To me, that's a big deal."
2,No Way,I have all of the 4 major sports books of the Total package.These stats were increddibally incomplete like they show no tackles stats. I know tackles are not an official stat but there are sources like with the Negro leagues in baseball that show the stats. I liked the part about the Top 300 players to 1998. The Draft had all of the picks but I wish they would have who the top players were in each draft like the hockey one.I thought this book was okay it had some good stats but is no where near Hockey-Baseball-Basketball versions.
2,An alright book!,This book was alright. Some of the words I couldn't understand. Words like roughing the passer. I believe that if someone has the ball they should know that they are going to get smashed!
5,Lieutenants,Fantastic Novel. This series (Brother hood of War) would make a great mini-series. However a mini-series would not do it justice. I never wanted it to end. I've read this entire series 5-6 times and The Corps series 3-4 times.
5,The unabridged audio was fascinating. I liked it.,"I listened to the audio while driving and doing yard work. It was a great book. Only 2 comments. 1) Mr. Griffin, you can't start a blood transfusion in an artery. You have to use a vein. 2) The end came too soon. I hope to find the next audio to pick up the loose ends. If I can't, I'll have to take the time to read it. Keep writing!"
5,terrific book as well as series,As a retired 1SG and veteran of all 3 combat arms I found Mr. Griffins 1st book of this series to be amazingly factual and correct as to military life and the warriors way of life I would recommend this series to anyone who has been in or around the military. I would also say that to anyone deciding on a military career this series should be required reading . Well done Mr. Griffin
4,A good summertime read.,"Having seen the name W.E.B. Griffin on numerous trips to the bookstore before, I decided to pick up this book and give a try as a light summertime read. I was very happy with my choice. Griffing weaves an enjoyable yarn centred upon a number of characters in the latter part of the Second World War and in the years immediately thereafter. While not containing some completely unfeasible plot, what Griffin does give you is a good story with interesting character development.This book is well written for its genre and I can highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good escapist read to pass away a lesilurely afternoon. I will certainly be picking up the other books in this series to read over my vacation."
3,This book is saved by its depiction of the war in Greece,"The counterinsurgency war in Greece immediately after WWII is one of the least dealt-with periods of the Cold War. There is no logical reason for this, since it was the U.S. military's first experience fighting Communist guerrillas, later repeated in Vietnam and Latin America. Griffin deals with a little known ignored but nevertheless important time and place, and does it well.There are only three books (I haven't read ""The Colonels"" yet, so I can't judge that) worth reading in the ""Brotherhood of War"" series: ""The Lieutenants,"" ""The New Breed,"" and ""The Generals"" (the best of the series, since it's the only one that can stand on its own apart from the series.)"
3,Griffin sliips,"The book was not up to Griffin's usual work. It was readable but not terribly enjoyable. I found it ""choppy.:"""
2,boring.,"The first few chapters where ok. Then is just turned into a soap opera. It gets boring very quickly, and jumps all over the place. over 100 pages where dedicated to playing Polo...really?!"
2,Disappointing that accompanying software doesn't work,"I think the book itself is good, but one of the things that attracted me to buy this vs. other books was the accompanying software, CADEC, to be used as a learning tool. Unfortunately the software doesn't work with Windows Vista, and probably Windows 7. I wish I had known that before I bought the book."
3,A Picture Book of Passover,"This book gives the history behind where Passover came from. The author writes about the story of Moses, and how his life was saved. One day a burning bush spoke to him in the words of God, and told Moses that he would be the new leader. As much as Moses pleaded for the Pharaoh to release the slaves, he declined and pushed them harder. As a reult Moses put a plague onto Egypt. These ten plagues swept through Egypt that attact various things. The Pharaoh soon let the slaves free, and sent Mmoses away. However, the Pharoah felt he had made a great mistake, and went after the slaves. Moses parted the sea for the slaves to get away from the Pharoah, and as the Pharoah proceeded across Moses commanded the sea to go back. As a result the Pharoah and his followers were killed. Tthe Israelites became a free nation. This became a celebrated holiday called Passover.us"
1,Disappointed,"Received a battery operating portable fan (model #1041) instead of the misting fan. Emailed the company, will post back once I know how they corrected it. Hoping they do!"
2,Super flimsy,I bought these for a trip to Thomas the Train and they were super flimsy and the top wouldn't even stay up. I would not buy them again!
1,So Cheap!! Not Worth the Money and Does Not Look Like the Picture At All,"The worst part of this hat is the quality. The material is thin and cheap. The bill feels like it is made out of cardboard. The hat does NOT stand up, like in the picture. When you put it on, it collapses and looks like a bundle of cheap fabric on your head. Last point - this is in no way a children's hat. It is too big on adults."
2,What You See Is Not What You Get,"I ordered this children's engineer's hat for my young grandson who is very much into trains at the moment. My husband often wears an engineer's hat, and I thought it would be a great idea to get one for Boone, age 2 1/2. Much to my disappointment, upon opening the package, I saw that it was simply a nylon type fabric cap with ""train/engineer"" type stripes.I am very disappointed. If I saw this item in a retail store, I would not buy it, and feel the photo accompanying the description here online, was desceptive. I ended up giving the hat to my grandson only because it didn't cost alot and was too much trouble to send back."
3,Cute hat,"The hat did it's job, is kind of flimsy. But, you get what you pay for. We still have the hat, and it's adjustable, so that's nice."
5,Perfect yellow color,"I bought this to go with the matching Hamilton color, and it works as you'd expect. It's actually 4 feet long, not 4 inches. :) Great banana yellow color, not too bright or too neon looking."
3,Poor Man Thomas Covenant,"Haven't yet read the entire series but the first book seems like a bad rip-off of Stephan Donaldson's ""The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant"".Okay, not a bad rip-off, just not as good. The beginning of the story could have been better written. Without giving anything away, one part of the story I thought could be better explained was how Wallie Smith went from complete and utter disbelief to complete belief in a matter of days.But overall it was a good (not great) book and I will finish the series (ordered the next two on my kindle today :)"
5,Reluctant Swordsman,I wish I had run across this book and this series years ago. This then would probably be my third reading. An engaging concept written with style and grace. Timeless and insightful. Truely an excellent adventure into the lives of a believable and well fleshed out world. The author receives my highest praise. READ THIS TRILOGY!
2,"Lame, Unfulfilled Promise","What you are promised: A savage swordsman with unparalleled abilities with the mind of a modern day average joe awakens on a new world and undertakes a heroic quest to save said world.What you want: Swordsman kicking all kinds of butt and average joe learning what its like to be a total badass. Getting the girl, challenging the gods, saving the planetWhat you get: Annoying whiny joe who second guesses anything remotely cool and does his best to be boring predictable and useless. Every interesting moment is chalked up to the will of the gods, and every challenge is overcome not with some positive attribute of a character, but some retarded magical coincidence that is thoroughly uncompelling.In the end, its just not a good book."
4,Does what it says it does,"Opens cans on the first try, quick, no mess. Under the cabinent mounting was a bit difficult though."
5,"AWESOME, VERY ROMANTIC","Having finished watching BYJ in the Legend, aka TWWSG, I wanted to see him in other roles and stumbled upon this series. This was a beautifully written and dramatised romantic drama amidst high powered mergers and acquisition in the hotel industry. I enjoyed this very much, needless to say that BYJ was awesome, the blurb describes it as his finest performance, but I think it is one of his finest performance as he was awesome in the Legend, winter Sonata and the others. I recommend this series whole heartedly for the sheer quality of the romantic lines and dialogue from BYJ."
1,DODDLE ART,"HOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT YOU ARE BUYING IF YOU CANNOT SEE THE PRODUCT? THIS IS THE MAIN REASON i HAVE NOT BOUGHT THE COLORING POSTER iI AM LOOKING FOR, NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ALL LISTED AS A BOOK AND I SURELY DIO NOT WISH TO PURCHASE A POSTER AND GET A BOOK. WHY CAN'T I SEE WHAT I AM BUYING? WHY IS IS LISTED AS A BOOK INSTEAD OF A POSTER? DOES A BOOK COME WITH THE POSTER YOU CHOOSE? HOW CAN ONE TELL THEY ARE BUYING WHAT THEY WANT IF THEY CANNOT SEE IT? I GUESS I WILL HAVE TI SEE IF THERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I CAN SEE WHAT I AM BUYING, I HAVE BEEN TO THIS WEB SITE MORE THAN A HUNDRED TIMES HOPING TO BEABLE TO VIEW WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR BEFORE I PURCHASE IT."
2,Not bad but only useful for those who live in the US.,"The resort information is good but this is clearly targetted at US residents. If Arizona, California and the Carribean are inconviently far away then there is not much for you. There are a few in Bali but Asia is poorly covered and Europe hardly at all."
4,"Works well, but...","The scrubber works as advertised. However, the design in how the handle holds the pads is not the best. Because of the design the pads can't be flipped over easily without getting messy. This isn't a huge con, but it should be noted."
3,Buy extra scrubber replacements!,"I recently purchased the Tool Wizard Grill & BBQ Brush and the scrubber lasted a total of one scrubbing. Now perhaps we scrubbed too hard, but whatever the reason, be prepared to go through scrubber replacements. The shipping cost is discouraging to ordering more. If you buy a Brush, just go ahead and order about 10 more scrubbers while you are at it."
1,BEWARE - Cheap Imitation - Poor Quality - Made In China !!!,"This brush is cheap crap that's made in China. I bought one for my father and the scrubby unravelled and fell apart, and the cheap plastic handle warped after two months of use. Additionally, this brush is a poor imitation of a great design. This brush is a cheap copy that only has 1 scrubby, which results in only cleaning the top of the grill grates. The original Grill Wizard brush has the superior design that actually has two high quality scrubbies, which results in cleaning both the top and the sides of the grill grate. Finally, in addition to the better quality materials and construction, as well as superior design, the Grill Wizard brush comes with a sturdy, wooden handle, which is traditional for BBQ tools. I don't know if Chris Kimball and his CI/ATK crew are confused or what, but don't waste your money on the Tool Wizard. Buy the original Grill Wizard brush!"
1,Not the real thing,"The BBQ Brush Wizard Grill Scrubber is a knock-off of the original Grill Wizard. It is a MUCH inferior product. If you Google Grill Wizard it will take you to the site of the original ""real"" Grill Wizard. The Grill scrubber is breaking patent law by marketing it. AMAZON! go to the Grill Wizard site at see the real deal. I have no connection to the make of the original other than being a customer."
2,"Great Brush, Below Par Scrubbies","I use my grill A LOT, and I also purchased this brush based on the America's Test Kitchen review because I was tired of the brass bristle brushes not cleaning well and the little bristles sticking in my fingers when I cleaned the inside of my grill.The brush itself is great; the angle of contact on the grill grates is perfect for cleaning...it hopefully will last a long time. The brush does do a better cleaning job, however, the scrubbies are ""Tool Wizard"", not ""Grill Wizard"", and they come apart after 20-25 cleanings."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,After reading a review in Cook's Illustrated on the Grill Wizard brush I immediately went out and bought it. The brush is TERRIBLE. After just one use the scouring pad completely unraveled and the brush is useless. I just e-mailed the company to find out what gives with this. Don't waste your money on it!!
1,Not the Cook's Illustrated brush,"Not the brush reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, a much cheaper knockoff. The grill wizard China brush with the wood handle and the much better stainless steel scrubbies is the way to go."
2,Not worth the price,I thought this was the answer to my problems. It wasn't. The head is not steady and flips open while cleaning the grill. The scrub pads take off only a minimal amount of burnt on matter and the product does not address the sides of the grates. It would have been better to include notched scrappers to get at trapped food.Very disappointed.
2,Burned by ...,the 5 star reviews. I bought this because of the 5 star reviews and I ordered extra cleaning pads at the same time. I didn't find that it cleans any better. The shipping costs are expensive and there is no tracking. I had to pick this item up at the post office.
5,Great Grill Grate Scrubber,"This ""brush"" is not really a brush, but it is an excellent grill scrubber. It gets the grate clean and because it isn't a brush but more like a heavy-duty stainless steel Chore Boy, it lasts longer than brushes. Brush bristles tend to lose there effectiveness fairly quickly; this tool lasts and works well."
1,Buyer Beware,"While America's Test Kitchen rated this brush highly in their 2008 test, it is not the real thing and it does not hold up. One wonders how many uses ATK got out of it. And there's some serious, unfortunate and misleading name infringement going on here."
5,What a Brush!,"She saw this on America's Test Kitchen and of course had to have it. We do BBQ all summer, so what the heck. I haven't heard her complain about it, so it must be ok."
2,Don't Buy. Not the Cook's Illustrated Brush,"This brush is not the model reviewed by cook's illustrated. This model has a different mechanism for holding the scrub pad. This model has a plastic device that screws into the head through the pad and holds it with four arms. these arms limit the amount of the pad that actually comes into contact with(and cleans)the grill. This is inferior to the recommended model which holds the pad with two metal prongs through the side of the pad and therefore the entire surface of the pad is involved in cleaning the grill. The Cook's model also has a metal head while this model's is made of the same plastic as the handle. The company name is correct on the package, they must have gotten a new manufacturer."
1,Not the brush tested on America's Test Kitchen,I agree with previous reviews. This brush lasts maybe one or two cleanings and then the scrubbing pad literally rips off of the handle.
