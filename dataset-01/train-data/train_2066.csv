2,too lite weight,"not heavy enough to stay in place when used,Therefore he is afraid to get on them.needs someway to attach to keep them from moving or sliding. Great idea though"
2,awkward and unstable,"these steps need to be taller and my dog refused to use them...he did try them but i could tell they made him nervous as they are too lightweight, and awkward height, and rickety...a waste of money because of the return policy ( i pay the return shipping and 25% restocking fee) it is hardly worth the cost and trouble to get barely ten bucks back."
4,worked great til I killed them,"We bought ours at a store that carries a lot of ""as seen on TV"" stuff. Took me just a few minutes to put them together and in a very short time all the dogs were using them to get on the couch, especially the shortest one who had a hard time getting up there without them. I even caught my agile cat using them for her nightly rips thru the house.Unfortunately they didn't survive me tripping over them and falling on top of them, they shattered in a bunch of pieces and had to go in the trash. I guess if I'm gonna be a klutz, I should invest in something that is strong enough to handle getting landed on or get the foam ones that'll pop back after a bashing."
1,Zero Stars,"Ditto to the first one star review. Unfortunately, I did not read her review prior to my purchase. This is JUNK. BEWARE 20% re-stocking fee."
3,Worth the Money,"I bought this product for my two basset hounds to use. I didn't realize it would be so small, and now I need something a little higher. If I could find the same product with the fourth step, I would buy it. This is an inexpensive product and you get what you pay for. It's not high quality furniture for our house; it's only meant to help the dogs get up and down their favorite chairs. If you want quality, be ready to pay a higher price. This one does the job and is sturdy enough to handle two 65-pound bassets.My dogs have short legs so this product is perfect for them. It's small (too small), it's low to the ground and has very short risers so it's easy for them to manuever those little legs around. Other steps I tried were way too steep for these dogs.As I mentioned earlier, I would buy this product again (with the additional step) because it seems the best fit for my dogs."
1,"CHeap, small, dog won't use it","If you look at the picture that is displayed it appears to be a reasonable size, BUT the steps are so small and close together that the older dogs can't use it. It says for dogs up to 70 lbs, my 30 lb dog can't use it. The steps are too close, small, narrow and then its made of plastic. For the price I could have gone to the hardware store, bought a 2x4, carpet scraps, screws, paid for the gas and had a better product and saved money.A 6 year old could build a better product.Very disatisfied."
1,Extremely Misleading Box Pictures,There is a reason why dimensions of the step are not included ANYWHERE on the box. This thing was so tiny when assembled it was a joke.I can't believe they actually showed this thing next to a truck bed. Even with the 4th step I cannot imagine this stepper coming close to the tailgate of a small truck.DO NOT BUY!
4,Macy steps,Our 7 pound Maltese loves the steps. Found them sturdy enough for her. Might be too flimsy for larger dog. Found them too short to reach top of her crate where she likes to lay so turned them upside down and it worked better for her. Because of their design we could attach them to her crate with piece of wire so will not flip over. Little shaky but works for her.
1,Junk,total junk. My dog is eleven pounds and won't use them. the step width isn't good and they are flimsy. With these you really do get what you pay for.
3,Gave a a Gift,I gave this as a gift. I'm not sure if the person (or their pets) enjoyed it. But when the gift was opened it looked fine and operational.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the three step doggy steps from Amazon.com based on photos showing similar size dog as mine climbing up to a bed. I should have looked at the height dimensions before ordering the three step stairs. The three step stairs maybe okay for a low couch but it doesn't come close to reaching a normal bed. In addition, the treads are two narrow in depth for my 13 pound Maltse to use.It goes to the next garage sale. It looks good in a photo but it doesn't delivery. This is my first purchase from Amazon.com I was not satisfied."
2,Flimsy,"Flimsy construction and not tall enough for pets to reach the bed. But, this shipper chose to use UPS and we appreciate the prompt delivery. The items also arrived in perfect condition."
2,Pee Pads,These pads are very thin and everything leaks to the floor. Would not buy again. I have a very small dog.
3,flimsy,"These steps werent too bad for the price, but they were a bit flimsy. I actually ended up returning them because my dog was too afraid to use them!"
1,Poor quality item,"This product is very poorly made. Assembly was difficult due to misfitting parts. The cover does not fit well, requiring me to add elastic across the bottom and stich the cover to the step risers with carpet thread.We have a 20lb Bichon, and a piece broke off where the steps fold. Now it makes a loud noise when she uses it. I will try to fix with duct tape.I was tempted to send this back, but decided that it was cheap enough to make due.I do NOT recommend this item."
3,Unhappy,"I had one of these steps when they first came out on TV. My doxies loved it. However, the cover was getting worn and I could not find just the covers. Therefore, I purchased the whole set - steps & cover. Well, the steps are terrible! Difficult to put together and then did not stay together. I ended up using the new cover on my old steps. They are much better!!"
2,Doggy Steps,Steps were poorly constructed and too small. My dog still will not use them even after training attempts. He goes up and down regular steps confidently but these steps do not provoke the same. He seems frightened and does not trust them.
2,Not as sturdy as I thought they would be,The description says up to 70 1bs and my dog is only 20lbs yet I worry that they'll come apart when she's on them. Made of plastic that snaps together and doesn't seem very secure to me. They look pretty nice though once you put the cover on it. I just purchased similar steps at CVS for $7.50. They look exactly the same and are made the same. Can't tell them apart. Save money and buy the ones from CVS instead.
1,disgrace item,do not waste your money. Worst item on amazon ! It seems completely different in the picture. Item comes as uninstalled cheap plastic and with a cover . Extremely disgusting product
5,Great Value,"These steps are a breeze to assemble - no tools needed YAY!!! - and are very sturdy. If need be, one can order an extra riser which makes them a suitable height for all but the highest beds. They also don't take up a lot of floor space. All and all, they're a great value for the price."
3,3.4 pound teacup poodle always needs a little help!!,"These stairs are functional, and my poodle of course uses them happily to get onto my bed by herself. However, I thought they were more padded or of better quality. They are made of a plastic frame that you have to put together and the carpeting is very thin and goes over the cheap plastic frame. I was a bit disapointed, but my poodle is happy; that's what's important overall."
1,Unstable,"This item was not worth the price. It is made of cheap plastic. The cover was fringed and falling apart. I have two pugs and they are scared to use it because it moves when they walk on it. I have tried several things to make it more stable, but nothing seems to work. I put it on a piece of carpet (we have tile in the house) ... I placed ruber under the four pieces of rubber that are already attached while it was on the tile and on the carpet ... One of the pugs went to use it and it actually toppled over onto him. I suggest to spend a few more dollars and get something that won't wobble."
2,It always happens to me,"Easy to assemble, but when I got to the crossbar in the back, they sent a crossbar with two left feet so to speak. They assembled two of the same crossbar, instead of a right and a left. Luckily I have an 11 lb dog, so it's not as stable as would need be for a 60 lb dog only able to use part of the crossbar."
4,Very Acceptable Pet Steps,"We bought two of the 4-steps about a year ago and are buying two more for our three shih tzus. The steps are lightweight, sturdy (we break them down and take them on road trips for use in the hotels/motels). They are easily assembled and disassembled. The girls have had no problems using the steps and one of them likes to hide under the set in the family room for her afternoon naps. We're buying more for grandma's house, etc. Our dogs use these steps many, many times a day and we're pleased how well the product holds up to what has to be called 'excessive' use by our two one-year-olds playing tag hours on end, using these steps. A good product at a good price. We're buying more."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Beware Beware this product is typical TV advertised JUNK! I would not even put it together and allow my precious dog to climb onto it. This came as a KD assemble yourself and is cheesy and flimsy and not worth half the money I paid! Then when I called R&G to return they expect me to pay a $5 restocking fee and will not refund the shipping! Brother was I taken for a ride! BE SMART and DO NOT order! Amazon you should take it off your sight YOUR reputation isn't worth this! I will return and get what money I can back, and I plan on telling everyone who will listen what a piece of JUNK this is! GJ Lichtel"
1,garbage,to weak to support a yorkie terrier a total waste of money i would give it NO stars if i could
1,Poor Quality,The cover does not fit the steps properly. The dog is scared to use the stepsdue to the cover slipping and sliding. I would not recommend these steps.
4,fabric was nice looking,The product is basically Styrofoam carved out in the shape of stairs and then covered with fabric. I didn't feel the Styrofoam was very durable. The fabric was nice looking and provided good traction.
5,Excellent,This is my second set of steps to purchase. I still have my fist set from several years ago. I just got tired of moving them. They work well for my 23 lb. Pekinese. Received them quickly.
2,"Cheap, rickety and with an ugly, ill-fitting cover.","Stay away from these. There are plenty of pet steps on Amazon of higher quality for comparable $. If you're looking for small, cheap, snap-together plastic steps with a cover that doesn't properly fit, then buy these. If you want something better, try a different brand."
4,good dog steps,"I had already purchased two of these doggy steps and really liked them. This one makes three. If the need for more ever comes up, I will buy another one."
5,Good for little dogs,"These stairs are GREAT for my 12-pound rescued dachshund. She can now get on the couch all on her own. I didn't even have to show her how to use them. She just jumped right up on them and onto the couch. The cover looks nice, and it cleans up in the wash well. Plus, they're soft on her little feet and keep her from slipping. They're also the perfect height for the couch and don't take up much space. I wouldn't use this for a huge dog (an older dog who needs help) because I don't think they're sturdy enough to hold an 80-pound elderly dog. But for a small dog, they're perfect. I have absolutely no complaints."
3,Great doggie steps,These steps work perfectly for our two little Maltese puppies. One must be careful as they are of lightweight plastic structure and can be broken if a person kicks them accidentally.
3,dog steps,My order included an offer to add a 3rd step. The URL referenced took me back to the original 3 step instead a a 4th step. I need the 4th step. Help!
5,Doggy Steps,"They're perfect for my needs. My dog is an old lady dog now, and she has a hard time getting into the car, so this was the perfect solution."
5,Doggy steps,"This is our second purchase of these neat little steps. It allows our small Yorkie to get up on chairs, sofa or up to the wiindow to view a larger world without assistance. It's wonderful and so light and handy to move around. Thanks!"
3,could be beefier,"customer service was great. The item arrived in record time, in flawless condition and exactly as advertised. But it isn't really what I had hope for. The plastic frame if very light and despite the ""grippers' mounted to the bottom my 20 lb beagle still tends to shove them away from the bed when she jumps in. The Chihuahua's need often encouragement that they won't move when they use them. So that is acceptable.They are a little shorter than I had hoped; wished there had been an option to purchase a fourth step. But they certainly do serve their purpose. I am happy to have them, but would not buy them again. They were certainly worth the money I paid for them."
3,Try figuring it out,Good item only problem is the assembly instruction are not clear. you need to be handy and have a good imagination to figure it out. Its like a puzzle. enjoy
5,"Perfect size, perfect value",These are exactly what I needed to help my older dog get in and out of the car! A Great value and fast shipping too!
4,Creme Brulee Perfect Everytime,"If you are a lover of creme brulee, this is the ultimate dessert cookbook for you.Comes out perfect, although you MUST ADJUST recipes to fit your brulee dish size. For instance, if you are using a shallow 5"" dish, you should bake the brulee for only 25-30 minutes and not the full 50 suggested in the recipe. Less sugar on the top for flaming was also better.But you will enjoy the recipe variations and will learn from doing how to create your own creme brulee."
5,satisfied customer,It was a pleasure to buy from this seller. The item arrived in a short time and was in perfect condition.
3,Not Bad,"This movie wasn't bad, and actually it proves that you don't need a big budget to tell a good story, and bring it to life. The acting was good, the plot was cool, and for a shoestring budget, outside of the picture quality (which wasn't the best) you can see a lot of hard work went it to it by all, and it looked like they had fun working on this project."
4,Divinely Entertaining,"This was a light hearted comedy with a spiritual message. I enjoyed the comedy, Shang has been a favorite for many years.It also has a great message, without being preachy.Recommended for the whole family."
2,Too religious and too sexy at the same time,"I bought this DVD based on the strength of the reputation of the actors. Too bad the story's characters were questionable. The new pastor is seriously ""checking out"" the old pastor's daughter and is oh so holy one moment, but can't wait to get her alone the next. The old pastor is hostile and jealous of the new pastor. The daughter dresses and at times behaves rather provocativley. Two of the deacons' wives are ""potheads"" whose scenes are not only far from funny, they seem to come out of nowhere and go nowhere.If it comes up on cable or satellite tv, then go ahead and watch it. But actually purcahse this DVD? That would be a mistake."
2,Not worth the price,"I was disappointed by the value, not the content. There are only two episodes on each tape. There are other videtapes out there for a better value (more episodes, for roughly the same price). I wish I had bought the reissues offered by my local department store instead of these."
2,No vibrating bunny ears.,"I put the batteries in and turned the shaft on and it squirmed around and the beads moved just as they were supposed to so I tried to turn on the vibrating ears and nothing happened.I bought the toy just for the ears and they didn't work. (AT ALL)The pearls are a cool sensation but I am highly disappointed in the toy also It was kinda big (I'm a beginner so Don't take the `big' part in consideration for me)Overall, I wouldn't buy this toy again and I wish I had not in the first place. Waste of money"
2,Not quite waterproof,"I loved it while it worked... life span was only a few months. It's not truly water tight, so it shorted out."
2,This bunny does not keep on going,"Well first of all the battery compartment is badly put together, I had to practically jam it back in there and now it's jammed forever which means I can't change the batteries and use it for future sexploration.However I did use it a few times and it was pretty good, but the head doesn't rotate like it says it does in the description and the pearls don't twirl either. The bunny ears do buzz though and give you a pretty good orgasm. Never had the chance to try it in the water since the battery compartment won't open. Oh well. It's pink and pretty, but I think there's better toyzz out there."
2,doesn't work,"shipped quickly, but does not work at all with batteries properly inserted. would not purchase again."
4,Econometric Theory,"It is simply a must-have for any serious theoretical econometrician. However, be advised that If you want to learn econometrics from scratch, this is the last book you should study. Certainly not for practicians."
4,Classical book,"Of course, this is a useful book for those who are interested in advanced econometrics or asymptotic statistics. Clear and concise definitions and theorems are smoothly described. Nevertheless, it's quite inconvenient for consumers without a tracking number in standard delivery!"
5,stotytellers,Some American Indians stories and legends.But I would rather have prefered more pictures of storytellers and notes on the artists.Still a good introduction to pueblo pottery.Huguette
1,Poor quality,"These *used* to be great. I have several still going strong that are over 30 years old. Unfortunately, with the outsourcing to China the quality also took a huge hit. At first glance they look the same as the old Made in the USA vise-grips, but if you put them side by side they're not even close. After a few months of use the teeth are worn to nothing and the joints are loose. Huge disappointment and even bigger waste of money."
4,Winterhawk - blues beginner,"I bought this cd because I liked the cover and also because I am trying to learn blues guitar, and who better then Johnny Winter to cop a couple of licks from. This cd shows you what Winter blues is all about. Bad News, three tracks, and Lightning Blues, an unreleased track make it difficult to figure out what goes into making the selection for the released track since all are great songs. The version of Rockin' Pneumonia on this cd just screams ""Listen to me"" on this cd. Hook You has some blistering lead work on it and Kind Hearted Woman makes you wish you knew who it was the song was about. The only reason I gave it a four was that I wish they filled the space with some live out takes instead of the unrealesed versions."
1,"used, ugly, usuless","it is looks better on the net.i ordered this watch with other Casio watches.I received all watches in the same time.others watches arrive with plastic case and brand new, but this one came with scretch on the glass.I cant believe they send me used watch.I thought they send me new one.I dont like this seller or supplier of watch.I choose brand new watch, they send used.and looks so cheap quality.I never seen before this quality watch.I bought 7.99 casio watch too, even that cheap watch looks better than this sheet watch.dont buy from this seller.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED."
2,Good watch until it leaked after 2 years light use,"Purchased this on Amazon primarily because it is advertised as water resistant to 100M and suitable for snorkeling, and comes with a 10-year battery, and had favorable reviews. It was water resistant for the first year of use, while under warranty, just failed (water leaked in) after a little over 2 year's occasional use. Never took it under about 2M underwater. So it you are looking for a watch that you can take into the ocean, which will last, this does not seem a good deal if you are expecting something that is going to last much beyond the 1 year warranty. Not worth repairing, since minimum repair charge seems to be $10 + shipping and handling."
3,Good for young boys,"The watch itself is acceptable, but the strap is another story.It is entirely too short and too stiff to fit an adult male's wrist. I normally have to have one or two links removed from wrist watch bands to fit my wrist, but this one - when buckled into the LAST hole was just barely long enough to wrap around my wrist, and then the portion of the strap that extended beyond the buckle formed a VERY stiff point that would catch on EVERYTHING, making the watch unwearable."
4,good watch,"My son has enjoyed this watch since he received it for Christmas. He has not had it long, but it is holding up well."
4,$20. ointment vs. Puralube,"Our one-eyed, blind, deaf, sweet 15-year-old pom. had terrible cataracts and a dry, crusty, build up in her eye that made her miserable. We used an antibiotic ointment recommended by our vet which didn't work well and cost $20. per tube. At a fraction of the cost, Puralube Vet Ointment did an exceptional job lubricating her eye and preventing build up, keeping her eye clear and comfortable. I highly recommend Puralube."
4,Sexy suspense,"M.J. Rose has a knack for weaving suspense and sex into an appealing pattern -- fear and sex, after all, do go together -- and for drawing real people. For example, Jordan's solicitousness with her patients is tempered by her stubbornness in her personal relationships. I alternately commiserated with and wanted to poke Lily, and I think I'm in love with Robert. These are all people I'd like to know. And I'd love to have some of that jewelry!"
3,Good Characters-- Too Much Plot!,"I see that most reviewers give this book either one star or five, but I'm going with three and a half. There is a great deal to like about this book-- it is far superior to her first novel, Lip Service-- but Rose still misses the master storyteller level.I won't recap the plot, there are several reviewers who have done a great job of that. I will say that the relationship between Jordan and her teenager is very well written. The daughter, Lilly, is extremely exasperating; I am gnashing my teeth just thinking about her. The themes of photography and jewelry are also fresh and intriguing. And I enjoyed eavesdropping on the psychoanalysis sessions between Jordan and her patients.My biggest problem with this novel came 3/4 of the way through when several different threats converge on Jordan's family. It felt like overkill to have a crazed stalker AND a scheming patient AND a malicious attacker. Maybe Rose's next book will get it right."
1,Not Art--Mediocre and Middle-Brow,"You see this book everywhere in my town, even at the airport. From the cover you can't tell if it's sex or mystery. It is neither. You can finish the sentences before they've begun. I don't know if I would give it one star but for the constant sight of it, which led me to imagine something better. I'd prefer art or schlock. This is the netherworld, purgatory for this reader."
5,A.J. Russo,"I found M.J. Rose's novel, In Fidelity to be gripping and erotic. It was a great follow-up to Lip Service. Her main character is as strong and believable a character as I have come across in a long time. This is a page-turner that you don't want to miss."
4,Delicious,"Now's the time to click on In Fidelity, so you have time to relish this and Sheet Music while waiting for Halo Effect. I love a book where I can sympathize with the characters' pains, glory in their pleasures, and feel just a little bit quicker on the uptake. Excellant suspense. Unlike many books featuring a woman in peril, this one does not feel like a made-for-TV-movie. Readers who grew up on Nancy Drew mysteries and moved on to the suspense of Daphne Du Maurier will recognize a familiar form presented in a format to appeal to literate readers.And, if that isn't enough, M. J. Rose is the Most Sensual Author in the World. I can smell, taste, feel, and hear what's written. Every scene is vivid and engrossing. Reading should always be this pleasurable. Nummy."
3,What matters most?,"Jordan Sloane, psychotherapist, has her own past demons to deal with. Her father's killer (and her former lover), is being released from prison. She knows he still harbors an obsession with her, and fears the worst. Her own marriage has been shattered by infidelity, and she is floundering, trying to find what matters to her the most, her own independence or her need for companionship and love."
3,coffee lover review,Kenya AA coffee from Aroma Ridge is slightly better than most in flavor but similar products are available for less money. It has been harder to find high grade Kenya since political wars of Xmas 2007. Best I've found in US is from Salt Lake Roasting company--also pricey but worth it for what I consider the best (or sometimes the worst) Arabica coffee in the world.
4,good old rock 'n roll,"one of the early ""concept"" albums by one hit wonder Ryan...lots of fun and nice guitar work"
5,Great CD to dance to!,This cd is fun and bouncy.A great way to praise the lord and have fun at the same time.My kids love it and we dance to it.And they ask for it in the car.
3,Smithsonian Folkways,Smithsonian Fokways CDs don't work on my Denon CD system. I have to listen to them on my computer. That's the problem with all of them.
1,Not as advertised,"This is very deceptively labeled. It has to be a woman's or child's watch. I am a man, do not have large wrists, and it barely fit, and not comfortably."
3,"Basic watch, does the job",This is about the most basic watch you can get. I ordered it because my son needed a watch for taking the ACTs since he wouldn't have access to his cell phone and there would not be a clock in the room. It did the job it needed to do. The strap doesn't seem too sturdy so I don't think it would hold up to much abuse.
1,Junk,This watch is not werth the postadge. If I could have left a zero I would have. Cancal My Amazon acount if this is the best you can do.
3,Not plastic,"I had to return these watches because the info on this page was incorrect, the watch band is plastic but the back of the watch is metal."
1,Casio Men's Watch,"Watch is a very good price, and very easy to read, however the strap has a sharp edge that is uncom-fortable."
5,GREAT FOR WHAT IT IS,"I like to wear a watch when I'm working on my cars. This watch is very small and low-profile, and has no conductive surfaces other than a tiny exposed part of the stem. Mine also keeps excellent time, and the minimalist look is very rive gauche. Less than $10--amazing."
3,Really small watch.,"The gentleman that is shown wearing this watch in the product images has a really thin wrist. This watch on a normal man will look like a tiny women's watch. I bought this simply to calculate heart beats per minute at my job and I won't be wearing it outside of work. This watch should be labeled as a children's item, not men's. Beware - it's REALLY small."
5,awesome still works,this watch is simple and awesomei never took it off even when i take a showerits lite and water resistantcannot go wrong for 10 bucks
5,perfect,"its small thin and out of my way. i dont even feel it on my wrist but when i need it its still working. the only thing about this, it got moisture inside it somehow, i was wearing it out one early morning, it was very foggy and i was laying in the grass but when i got up i noticed moisture in my watch so watch out"
1,broke after a month-,"nice watch- too bad it lasted just long enough to be out of time to return to amazon- if you want a watch to wear once, ok- if you want a watch to wear every day, keep shopping-"
4,Accurate watch but the band is a bit small,"This watch is inexpensive, attractive and accurate. The numbers are easy to read and there is a second hand. Straightforward design, no glow-in-the-dark, light, calendar, or special functions.However, the band is a bit short. It measures 8 1/8"" from the hinge of the buckle to the last hole--which you really can't use without losing the watch. The rubbery material doesn't seem to be stretching out, either. If you have large wrists or like to wear a watch loose like a bracelet, then this one may not be ideal.Otherwise, at this price it would make sense to buy a new watch rather than have the battery replaced in another inexpensive one.The movement is made in Japan and the watch is assembled in China.The front says ""Water Resist"" and the metal back says ""Water Resistant"" which means it is okay to wash your hands while wearing it but not to submerge it in water."
4,For under $10 it seems great.,"Comparing this to most of the stuff I see at Wal Mart for under $10 its much better. It is easy to read. However, I made a mistake and didn't measure out the bezel size in the description. I find it to be small on my wrist, and I have very small wrists. I would recommend measuring out the size in the description first.I actually bought this watch to use on a timed exam where I have to re-adjust the watch every 35 mins when taking the exam. During practice I found it a bit tough to pull out the crown, and for that only I give it 4 stars. However, most people will probably not have to regularly adjust the time so they probably will not find this as much of an issue."
5,Worth its Price,"I'm not the type to accessorize like crazy when I go out, so having a timepiece that's this simple and affordable is perfect for me. Black, matches well with everything and the resin doesn't stick to your wrists as much after it swells and sweats by the end of the night. I should make sure to up the quantity on my Wish List should the first watch wear out because I love this thing."
5,CHEAP AND SIMPLE,"I love simple things. It it doesn't get better then this. It is inexpensive well built and easy to read. I bought it for my 75 year old father and he loves it. He can read it easily, thin, and light."
3,"good, cheap watch","this watch is nice and simple. it has a clean look and is not as bulky as other cheap watches. plastic band, so don't expect anything too classy. i wish it had a the date though."
2,Looks like a Toy and not worth the price,Flimsy. I don't normally wear watches and just needed one for clinical rotations. Cloded up when I got cold water on the outside of the clear plate of the face. I think I spent like $10 with shipping; I ended up buying another more expensive watch.
5,Everyone should own a complete set!,"These books are great! The illustrations are amazing and the characters will capture your heart while teaching children the truths about God.Joey has captured the innocence and energy that make children so special. Adults will be reminded of the faith and trust of children that we should all have when it comes to trusting God.These books make a perfect gift for any child or a unique baby shower gift for those who are expecting. Joey has not only presented the truth of God in easy to understand books, but his illustrations really come to life. I love them all!Be sure to read the Forward and A Word to Parents in this book. It is a great message to adults as well!"
4,"Good book, but didn't give the clearest picture of the 3 in one concept.","If you want a children's book that really gives a great explanation of the Trinity you should try ""3 in 1: A Picture of God"". It explains the Trinity using the example of an Apple.I bought this book and the 3 and 1 book to use for a Sunday School class, and I will probably not use this book and focus on the other one.That being said, this book is good for an introduction for really little kids, maybe 3-5 year olds, but much over that and I think they would lose interest. So I give it 4 stars because it is a good book, but I know there is at least one out there that is better, and that one will get my 5 stars!"
1,No Meat. Example Code Does Not Work on WLS 6.1,"This is a very light overview of Weblogic and J2EE. This book is a step-by-step follow-the-numbers outline of how to get a particular example program to work. You will not find any indepth information on why things are done the way they are.A lot of space is wasted on screen shots of DOS shells that show how to run a .bat file.Even though it is advertised as supporting WLS 6.0, I am disappointed that the webauction example source code / build scripts do not work with WLS 6.1. Considering that this book was just published and that its copyright is dated as 2002 (sic), the example code should run on the current version of Weblogic.To add insult to injury, the ""questions / comments"" email address on their web site bounces."
3,A good book for beginners,"I would say this is an OK or good book for beginners, but not for advanced users. It touches every aspect of J2EE (JSP, Servlet, EJB and JMS) and references Weblogic whenever applicable. But it does not provide the depth an advanced user is looking for. The screen shots from DOS windows for executing a batch file are not necessary. The paper quality of the book is bad."
3,No Help Available,"I purchased this book in September 2001. I worked through a few examples and had several problems with versions of WebLogic, build scripts, etc. The author was helpful with the problems and had a web site with corrections and errata. I returned to the book recently (January 2002) and now the website is gone and the author is nowhere to be found. Think twice before you buy this book. Its a good reference but I'd recommend Enterprise Java Beans 3rd Edition coupled with Weblogic Server 6.1 Workbook. There is help available for these books and combined they cover as much if not more ground."
1,Quality of this book causes much confusion.,"On the surface this book looks very informative. It does give a broad understanding of J2EE.BUT, I found the numerous errors and typos to be very distracting to the point that I had to write this review. I would bet there are typos on almost every page of text. Some are so bad that I could not understand the entire topic. Others were less obvious until I read other sources that contradicted this book. In other words, I thought I knew the topic until someone else corrected me. Very bad!Despite the reviews that maybe correctly portray the overall book, I highly recommend boycotting this publisher for putting out such a poor quality book. I for one will try my best to never buy a Prentice Hall book again."
2,Disappointing,None of topics are covered in any detail. The documentation on BEA's web-site is probably far better than this book.
2,Who Proofed this?,"Answer: No one. While this book is fairly comprehensive in its coverage of developing J2EE applications on WebLogic Server, it appears to be thrown together. It looks like no one proof read the book. Paragraphs and examples are repeated or nearly repeated within pages, fonts change. This has all the markings of a first draft. BEA and Michael Girdley should insists on a higher quality job if there is ever a second edition."
2,Don't buy this (updated review),Last fall when I first reviewed this book it was the first Weblogic 6.x book available and the best of breed at the time despite being deeply flawed because the proofreading was poor and most of the examples required fixing before they would work.I may have been the first person to go through this book in detail and I provided detailed eratta to the authors which they published on their website. Today the website appears to be gone.You will be much better off buying Monson-Haefel's Enterprise Javabeans 3rd edition and downloading the Weblogic 6.1 workbook from his website than buying this book now. This is the way to go for a Weblogic beginner IMHO.The best overall EJB book now is the Ed Roman book from the Middleware Company.I am looking forward to an updated version of this book covering the new Weblogic 7.0 (Cajun) product however.
5,Excellent book in designing a good J2EE application,"I like this book comparing with other J2EE books because:1. Reading other J2EE books is like learning driving in a parking lot. This book illustrates how to apply J2EE technology to a real Application Server.2. This is not a book written by a dozen people in a few months with over 1000 pages.3. Solid and important advises in the Best practice section for each chapter. Definite a big plus in designing a high traffic volume application.4. Concise and clear. Cover the most important J2EE technology.Room for improvement for next edition:1. Clean up some typo.2. Add local interface for EJB. (But most people should be able to pick this up in a 2-page long technical article.)3. Add Web Service if it can live up to its hype.This book will help you becoming a solid J2EE and Weblogic programmers. However, I should not raise too un-relalistic expection. A lot of hard work is still needed to become a J2EE guru."
3,Best in class (it's the only one ...!),"Fortunately, it's the only book about WebLogic 6. This would make it the best there is in its category !No, seriously, the book is a good reference for someone familiar with Weblogic, but lacks little bits of critical info that render it useless to someone trying to use it as a self instructional tutorial. I would have loved to see disected the RDBMS security paradigm, for example, so that a DBA could go directly into a database and define there the users and passwords and glue that info to WL 6 configuartion stanza.So it should come to no surprise, this thing among others, is missing."
1,First Draft,The intent is laudable. The execution is not. This book reads like a first draft. There are numerous errors and typos. It might be worth forgiving these shortcomings if the book covered WebLogic or J2EE well. It doesn't. Save your $$$ -- buy a different J2EE book or wait for a corrected and revised edition.
2,"Pretty OK, if you can spot the errors","I bought this book in order to learn about the changes in the Weblogic architecture in version 6. At the time of this writing I have read 6 chapters. I found many errors in the book, mostly misspellings and sometimes the code given is also wrong. There is no way that the code would have worked. If you understand Java well, you will be able to spot the errors. I think it is a good book for understanding the changes to weblogic in version 6."
2,Rob,"The product advertisement is misleading. The Amazon add appears to offer the product as a kit, which includes an air chuck hose and gauge. The word `kit' is extremely misleading and not what I have been accustomed to in Amazon advertising. Because the tank valve did not come with a hose and gauge, I had to use my old air tank hose and fabricate a fitting in place of the gauge. Very unsatisfied and disappointed."
1,Poor quality.,"I ordered this manifold to replace the original that came with the air tank because it leaked air. After installing the new manifold and attaching the pressure gauge and connector, I found that the cut-off valve would not turn either ""on"" or ""off."" Forcing the plastic knob to turn, it broke. So now I can turn on and off--using a pair of vice grips. In addition, it doesn't hold air much better than my old manifold.There must be something that works better than this!"
1,This book disappointed me,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Bondage Breaker, is a book chock full of godly and spiritual. I would recommend that book for panic attacks and anxiety moreso than Freedom From Fear. This book totally misses the mark. Neil and the other guy's attitude towards people with panic disorder is condescending and dismissive, to say the least. He even seems like he's blaming people with this disorder for bringing it on themselves with sin. That's so far off the mark I couldn't believe he would say something like that. I was very dissapointed, especially after reading The Bondage Breaker, which was wonderful. And in case you're wondering, I'm a born again Christian. I have panic disorder and I want to get out of this God's way, not the world's way, which is why I was so disappointed when I read this. I bought a secular book by Dr. Carbonell called ""The Panic Attack Workbook"" instead."
5,marvelous!,"Neil Anderson is filled with the Holy Spirit and it shows in the knowledge of his books/ministry. This book is no exception. I especially like the bedtime prayer model and wrote it on a large index card. I pray the prayer when I go to bed. It helps me keep my thoughts focused where and on whom they should be. I hope he continues to write on warfare and I wish he would write a book exclusively on sinful eating habits and how to ""eat in the Spirit"" without going 'under the law!."
5,Another awesome book by Neil Anderson,"This is yet another awesome book by Neil Anderson. It's easy for most people to say ""Get over your fear,"" but he makes a lot of great points in how to do so. I can be reading his book, and come across something I hadn't heard about or thought of before. He sure gives me a lot to think about. I've recommended this book, as well as others of his, to friends, and will continue to do so."
4,good,"good book, as will all Neil t. Anderson books, very well done, to the point and very applicable to issues with many of us."
2,Disappointing amount of rust,"All three Norpro strainers I ordered rusted after the first use. Basically unless I dry them off immediately after washing them (can't let them air dry) they develop lines of rust on the strainer part. After 6 months of use small pieces of the strainer have completely rusted out and there are holes, despite diligent cleaning and drying. Very disappointed."
1,Norpro stainless steel 3 piece strainer set,when I received the strainers one of the 3 was discolored and they are all suppose to be 18/10 ss - I washed all 3 in the dishwasher and now it is very clear that the one with the discoloration is rusted and the mesh size is different in quality and size than the other 2 - I thought I was purchasing good quality but so wrong - extremely disappointed in quality.
3,Neil Diamond Collection from 1968-1972.,"Neil is a big star in the US and worldwide too.Some of his best songs can be heard here, Cracklin' Rose, I Am...I Said, Song Sung Blue and Sweet Caroline, although I prefer The Hollies version of He Ain't Heavy...He's My Brother.He also inteprets Tom Paxton's The Last Thing On My Mind and (I think) Gary Puckett And The Union Gap's Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon.So some good stuff can be found, however for me not much else hits the highest spots, all the same 3 stars."
4,Great Looking Shoe,"This shoe is absolutely gorgeous! However, if you order this shoe I recommend going 1/2 a size up. Unforunately, I did not. Now I have to return the shoe."
5,Cocker ears - love Oti-Clens,I have used this product for years on my cocker spaniels ears and they have only suffered one ear infection... when I was out of this brand and bought another brand. Oti-Clens in combo with narrow water bowls... solve ear problems.
5,Brothers Four,I have enjoyed The Brothers Four since 1962. Was thrilled to find this CD and am very pleased with both the product and the service.
5,Great summer buy!!!!!!,"I of course have not purchased this 4th to 5th grade as my daughter is going to the 5th Grade, but I have used the 3rd to 4th and it is wonderful. I had previously purchased for my local Boys & Girls Club other grade levels and they are just great! Many parents loved to have their children working on these while still having fun! Highly recommended!"
3,A keeper,"Got this as a birthday gift for my son (10). He gets it out from time to time and takes on another trick. He's gotten pretty good at some of 'em. They aren't witch crafty or creepy, just simple optical illusions that do take practice and effort to learn and perform. Only gave it 3 stars due to the price. The video is very short and isn't much bang for the buck."
5,Adolescent God,"Through a series of short stories, the author uses metaphorsand abstract examples to really make you think. It's refreshing tohave a book about religion that makes you actually stop and think.The stories aren't the standard 'Bible' stories you're parents told you, just written in a different form. The moral isn't written at the end in bold print. The author does a great job of allowing the reader to come up with their own meaning. Great book! Check out 'Symmetery'(p.24). It's my favorite!"
5,Super Gabba-Gabba!,"Gread DVD! It features Differences and The Train. A must-have for your kids.Yo Gabba Gabba is educational, fun, amazing, WONDERFULLY PRODUCED.Love the dvd; it works perfectly. No scratches. Came in time. Thanks! I will go buy some more now."
5,My son loooves Yo Gabba Gabba,This CD has paid for it self over and over. This is one of my son's favorite things to watch.
4,love it,myn son will love this gift. it is for christmas it came in quick and in time for christmas :)
4,DVD,"My one year old princess loves Yo Gabba Gabba and this video has alot of music and fun, she loves it!"
4,Good seller,"It looks good and came in a few days. I have not put it in yet, don't have time, but I am happy with it so far and it was easy to buy here and at a reaonable price."
5,Very nicely done. Well worth the price.,"I was only looking to get an overview of the language, purely out of intellectualcuriosity. I got that and more. With no other reference material, I now have a goodunderstanding of German grammar and pronunciation.I've listened to the audio CDs multiple times in my car while commuting to work andeach time I pick up a bit more. I did finally break down and purchase a workbook andtext book because you really need to see the words written down and spelled out.I do wish they'd move the microphone away from the narrator though. Apparently she hassticky saliva and you can here it clicking and sticking with every word. Kind of grossafter a while. Perhaps she should drink more water."
1,Only an american can writte this book,"In my oppinion someone that has written this book is someone that has never been in Spain and if he likes to writte about fiction he sould avoid using names, places or, at least, get some information about what he is written about."
1,This is pure racism,"Spain is not a country like Yugoslavia. Spanish people live without the tensions that the author mentions. Spain is not a banana-republic. Mr Tom Clancy, please... come to Spain before saying all that nonsense. You can do it better."
1,Upset. I am upset.,"I have read this unbelieveable piece of nonsense titled ""Tom Clany's Op Center: Balance of Power"". I don't want to talk about it's ignorance of Spain and Europe, nor about it's idea of a civil war between Spanish states (it's like thinking about that a war between California and Colorado is possible, absolutely THE SAME), no, I don't want to talk aobout it. Please, read the rates of the reviews of the USA readers: 10, 8, 6... , and read the rates of the spaniard ones: 1,1,1... As I suspected. We know the reality of our country, and all our medium citizens know something bout the contemporary reality about USA; the opposite, as the rates show, doesn't happen: the medium citizen of the USA have NO IDEA of what happens in the world, far away the frontiers of ther own state. Well, you have a serious problem as conclusion: you have a really bay education system, if it produces readers like this, and, of course, ignorant, arrogant and silly writers like this."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Spanish politics and shooting.The Op-Center is a semi-independent agency that gets to do some dirty, dangerous work.This time it involves getting mixed up in Spanish politics, virus, and terrorism, leading to a stressful time for all, as it doesn't take long for an assassination to happen.Just an ok thriller type book is all."
1,The deepest ignorance about Spain I have ever seen,"Mr. T. Clancy shows a complete ignorance about spanish way of living, people, culture and all the related topics about it. He has written a book playing with people's lack of knowledge about Spain and its history."
4,A Good Action Book!,"Personally, I found this book to be very entertaining. The Op= Center intelligence apparatus finds that Spain is about to begin experiencing internal problems. A potential revolution is just about around the corner. A Spanish General and his loyal troops are poised to take over the government of Spain. The general has a good following among the army units of the Spanish Army. The Striker unit is called upon to save Spain from an armed insurrection. The General and his troops are finally overcome and defeated by the Striker unit. The General is killed and his troops are defeated. The Striker unit once again saves the day. I thought that Tom Clancy used imagination is using Spain as a setting. The reading was exciting and came closed to being action packed. This was not a bad book. I was well satisfied."
3,Controverted Entertainment,"Not a bad political fiction-action hibryd, the more controversial think, here in Real Life Spain, is how inacurate and exagerated the political and -really think about it- ethnical thing is developed. Is not like if it was inacurate or misunderstod... it's all magnificated and distorted, transforming the every day political circus into a liberty treathening plot. Some body wrote in a Newspaper that Balance of Power was an aberration... It's not true... it's just fiction, from the first word to the last comma... and it's really well constructed and entertaining..."
1,Don't WASTE your money & time on this one,"For an author renown for his meticulous research on his previous books, Tom Clancy has definitely not done his homework on Balance of Power. His lack of understanding (& ignorance) of the present political/social situation in Spain is incredible, to say nothing about the totally unrealistic plot of the book - laughable. It is obvious to this reader that the author has never spent any time in Spain. As a Spanish reader, I found his characterization of Spaniards one dimensional & totally demeaning. As for his use of the Spanish language, I suggest he use a proper Spanish dictionary. Personally, I think Tom Clancy has confused the situation in Yugoslavia or maybe Russia & tried to apply it to modern day Spain.In conclusion, Balance of Power is a badly written book (where was the editor? ), with an unrealistic plot. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DOG!"
5,"Absolutely the best of the ""Op-Center"" series!","I was disappointed with the first Op-Center book, it was so obviously NOT written by Clancy and lacked his intricate web of story line and whatever it is that makes Clancy such a great writer. However, ""Balance of Power"" did not disappoint me in any way - what a great read! Intricate plot lines, interesting characterizations, great action and suspense to the last page made for a book that cannot be put down - just like a typical Clancy work. Do it again!"
1,Where is this country?,"Being from San Sebastián and living in Madrid, I was immediately drawn to this book when I saw that the action starts in these two cities. I finished the first 100 pages out of curiosity, the rest of the book out of sheer masochism.The story is poor and full of stereotypes, the ""historical facts"" are wrong, the research was done without leaving the plane at the Barajas airport, and the characters are from a Scooby Doo cartoon (my favourites are the fisherman and the priest)...even at some points the book turns completely ""kitsch"" (asking a shepherd for directions in San Sebastian??).There is not worse lie than a half-truth, and the book is full of them. I know it is just a novel, but I expected a bit more refinement from Mr. Clancy et al."
2,Clancy as an example of American ignorance,"I had the chance to read this book during my last business trip to the States and I was very interested to see how Clancy dealt with this story about pseudo-nazi attitudes in today's democratic Spain. I've got to say that the plot is catching enough, masterly webbed; the setting though is not credible at all and, besides that, it's insulting not only for Catalans but for the rest of Spain's nations as well. In Europe, people usually have the feeling that Americans are ignorants in many matters as long as these don't relate to the US. Some of us, after knowing lots of educated American folks, changed our minds and began to think this was another old fashioned topic with no truth behind it. Unfortunately, Mr Clancy has made me change my mind again. Sorry."
1,Couldn't give it zero,"I can see why the Spainards hate this book. I have never been to Spain and besides Medieval history and Franco of course I don't know much about the nation beyond the norm. However, the idea of Spain turning into genocidal Balkans is just silly to me. Yes it happened in the 1930's but many things happened in the 1930's a time of insanity and hate.Also the pyschobabble was just plain annoying to me. ""She was there when Martha was killed, the guilt is going to put her into shock and paralize her!"" Right and that is why whole armies stop fighting when they lose comrades. Stupid and not even close to human reality and just plain annoying to read.I will stay away from Clancy and the techno-thriller crap. Bring back some good old cold war novels those were his master pieces. This sucks will not bother picking anymore up when I see them."
1,Trite -- all cliche,"The first 120 pages consist of trite, stereotypical dialogues between nearly two dozen agency directors and various bureaucrats(mostly in Wash., DC). There is no focus on one particular person and hence ruins the reader's interest, let alone empathy. The language lacks sparkle and originality. The book ends with the typical and foreseeable carnage that is as boring as it is unrealistic. I hope no one gets the idea of making another worthless movie from the gore."
2,Read between the lines,"Did any one of the people bashing the book, note the bottom of the cover, where it ISN'T WRITTEN BY TOM CLANCY. Tom Clancy's Op Center is the name of the series, originally by Tom Clancy. This literary abortion was not written by him, but by another no name contracted. Learn to recognize who wrote a book before you write off an author wholesale."
1,catalans are not serbs,"Even in a fiction book, the comparison between catalans and serbs is hateful. Specially since we feel much more like the Croatians or Slovenians: the rich Nation of the State, paying lots of money to the other parts of the State, with some basic rights in the edge of discrimination against us; and still being hated and/or missunderstood by most of the other people. I just think the author doesn't know anything about what he's writting. Very unfortunated."
2,Very dissapointed in the quality (?) of this production.,"This DVD is compiled of a visit to the countryside of West Virginia followed by an outdoor 4th of July concert. Hosted by The Nashville Network's ""Crook and Chase"" gives the disk a lively yet monotonous atmosphere. The outdoor concert has terrible video quality...in fact on some shots one can hardly make out the picture. The song selection is an excellent choice of Statler Brothers gold. I seriously doubt that we will ever witness a quartet like the Statlers again. Their vocal range is as pure and impeccable as ever with soul touching lyrics that generates continual applause from the large audience. Although the audio quality is very good, I must admit disappointment in this production. The Statlers had some excellent production in their last TV series. A compilation of these hits under a better production would have been much better value. Maybe next time?"
5,Wide range from an incredible artist,"I'd heard so much about Cathy Berberian that I jumped at the chance to buy this CD. I was particularly interested in what she did with the Folk Songs (since I'd worked on them myself). She is subtler than I expected, but always clear in her interpretation. She has a surprisingly youthful sounding voice, and I suspect she was something of an actress (Recital I)! The range goes from avant garde (Recital I) to show tunes (Kurt Weill), with everything else in between, and she performs all equally well. The reviews sum it up well."
1,Confused,"I have the Sarah Walker recording of Berio's Folksongs, but I wanted to hear Berberian's interpretation, as the songs were arranged for her. What a shock: terribly annoying voice, intrusive accent in the English numbers, embarrassing pronunciation of Italian and Russian, and shallow, formulaic over-acting. Berberian fans would do well to check out Sarah Walker: gorgeous voice, careful and elegant pronunciation, exquisite phrasing -- and, in dramatic numbers, powerful acting. In addition, for all those who appreciate Berio, Henze, and other ""modern"" music composers, Walker has done her share, not only Berio and Henze, but also Maw, Tippett, Taverner -- and the older composers from Monteverdi through Wagner (she has the best hoy-yo-to-jo of them all.)"
5,great drug dealer story.,"it starts with friends dealing drugs then with time they become so powerful but at the end they end up turning on each other, its war."
2,Good Series Worthy of Better DVD Release,"Presumably if you're considering this DVD you already know something about the series. It's a good miniseries -- much more realistic than your typical Latin American telenovela. The problem is the DVDs -- one disk we can't get to play at all (on several different players). Other disks have problems with certain chapters, or will play up to a point then stop. As it was, I was annoyed, but if I had not seen the whole series on TV when it first played in the US, it would have made it impossible to follow. Even though this showed on Telemundo with subtitles in English, they are missing here. Considering that plenty of the dialogue is in colloquial, Colombian narco-slang, that makes it hard to follow for non-native speakers. There is a disk with some ""extras"" but nothing like what you would get with a US (or most foreign) films on DVD.It's a good series worth watching, but it deserves a better quality DVD release."
2,GREAT PLOT! POOR QUALITY OF DVDS,"THE PLOT OF THE STORY WAS INTERESTING. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN IT ON T.V. I WANTED A COPY OF MY OWN, BUT WHEN I RECIEVED THE DVDS THAT I HAD ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON FROM A COMPANY CALLED ""PRODISCOS"" THE ITEMS WERE OPENED AND THE DVDS WERE SCRATCHED!! I HAD ORDERED AND PAYED A LOT OF MONEY FOR A NEW COPY THAT WAS NOT NEW AT ALL. THE DVDS WERE LOOSE FROM THE CASE. THE ITEM LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN USED. I WANT TO RETURN IT. CAN I HAVE SOME HELP ON HOW TO DO THIS. THANK YOU!"
3,70% satisfied,"It's a great series but DVD quality is not. They freeze too much, picture is excellent, sound quality varies between chapters. If I was the producer I would include at least English CC, my wife is american and she loves the serie but I have to be tranlating at all the time."
1,El Cartel,"La serie es muy buena, pero la calidad de los DVDs es pesima, al menos 4 discos no sirven y ""musica del recuerdo"" ni siquiera contesta e mails o llamadas telefonicas."
3,Good Novela,I watchecd this Novela on T.V. and wanted to own it. It comes with 13 dvd's. 2 did not work. I e-mail the company and have not received a response. I hope you have better luck than I did.
2,inexpensive as promised,"Not great, but it works. Can't beat the price. It feels like it may fall apart at any moment."
4,Makes you wonder !,"A bit repetitive and hard to follow but still a must read. Although all dates provided may be subject to review and/or revision, the author provides a strong relationship between a catastrophic event and mythologies description of unexplained events. I believe this book has served two purposes: number one, it increases our awareness of possible meteor impacts on the Earth in the future; and number two, it provides an alternative interpretation of world mythology and the Bible itself. AC.CHB"
3,Buyer beware: This book is a mess in Kindle format,"While I much enjoyed the content (I'm about 3/4 of the way done reading it), I must say that the Kindle version of this book has major formatting errors that make it hard to understand at times. The problem is that frequently, a paragraph splits off in mid-sentence, and the remainder of the paragraph reappears a page or two later, with out-of-order material in between.Sometimes you can figure out where a given thought leaves off and picks up again. At other times these passages are so chopped up that you can't figure out what's going on.This isn't the fault of the basic Kindle format nor of Amazon. It's the publisher's fault. Somebody should have checked this e-version before the book was offered for sale. It's so bad that I'd ask for a refund if I could figure out how to get one...but unlike physical goods that are damaged, it's hard to negotiate a refund for an electronic download.I hope the print version is better organized."
2,I found it boring and useless...,"I didn't get all the way through or even more than partially through, it just bored me too much in the beginning and seemed to just state common sense. I didn't read the ratings but most people (who I'm assuming read it all the way through) seemed to really like it so I suggest reading their reviews and seeing what I may have missed later on in the book."
5,Develop habits for highly successful introductions,The suggestions and areas of focus are presented in ways that make sense in most instances of introduction. The scenarios relate to many personal experiences and has made for good discussions with my friends
1,What is it with writers like this?,"Are they just too lazy to fact check and, instead, just pass along the myths they hear? Or do they knowingly mislead their readers to further an agenda?This is utter garbage from start to finish and unworthy of anybody's time or money."
4,For those who question why!,"If this country is going to survive, then we all need to protect and defend the constitution. Freedom of speech, religion, and the 2nd amendment. We must stop the destruction of our way of life. After it's gone it is to late, and we going to have to start all over."
5,Excellent Book!,"The book is exactly what I was looking for. It is well researched and to the point! If you are sick of the ""politically correct"" takeover of our history books this is the book you should read."
1,"""Christianism"" on the rise",This inaccurate 'vision' of the founding documents is a distorted attempt to tie religion and state ever closer.
1,More historical revisionism from the pro-theocracy crowd,Newspeak for the ditto heads. The founding fathers never could have believed how the David Barton's of today would twist history in an attempt to convert our great country from a secular state with freedom of religion and freedom from religion to a theocracy.
1,Crapola,"This book, and I use the term loosly, is lies and more lies. Nothing but REVISIONIST history. We are a secular nation. Barton had better get used to it instead of shoving this crap down our throats."
4,Enlightening and honest,"This book will give you an honest and informative account of how our country was truely formed by our ""Founding Fathers"". David Barton does a perfect job of making his point with documentation that holds up. There is no way to dispute the intent of the framers of our constitution because the author quotes their speeches and writings. While I found the point hammered home over and over, I still think that this is a book that you must have. I was able able to learn a great deal of information about many of the ""founding fathers"" through Mr. Bartons writings. I enjoyed getting a brief biograpy on some of the most interesting and patriotic people of our great nation's beginnings. You will walk away very enlightened."
1,"lies for lazy, unimiganitive people to hide behind","this should go in the library at the creationism museum, right behind the flintsone-like dinosaur garbage disposal. i am tired of being sermonized to by people who won't ever admit that they could be wrong about something, people who judge the world, but have never visited it, people who believe that God is on their side, no matter what horrible acts are committed in his name. true crap. should do well with the 26 percentile..."
1,History should not be revised,This book is totally revisionist history. It is fabricated to make history fit what Barton wanted it to.
1,revisionist pseudohistorian strikes again,"If you want to understand original intent this is not the book for serious students of history. However, there are a number of excellent books available that accomplish what this book does not. Other reviewers have done an excellent job of criticizing this book so I will not bother to reiterate the many weaknesses of this book."
5,Very well documented,"The evidence that David Bartion used was based on quotes from the Founding Fathers themselves. Current books often state their own opinions as fact, but David Barton does the research and shows what the Founding Fathers themselves said."
5,Non-Christians will hate anything Christian,"It is no surprise that non-Christians do not like this book. The book lays out the truth that our country WAS founded on biblical principles. That is why the book in which the Declaration of Independence was drawn from, John Locke's Two Treatises on Goverment, quotes the Bible multiple times on how government should be organized according to God.As a non-believer, you obviously will not accept this because if you did, you would have to accept God and to accept God means you know that you will be accountable for your life and how you live it."
3,Original Intent a bit over the top.,"Original Intent by David Barton depended mainly on what the founders wrote and did not, in my opinion, bring that wisdom forward. Most of what is contained in the book are quotes of the original language and publications which are very strong. But we need to interprete what was written. I am not a history scholar. I am thinking there is another side to this history that Barton did not reveal in its fullest. All in all, I do like the book. TK"
3,Don't trust the 5 STAR reviews nor the 1 STAR reviews.,"I wish people would review the book and not push their own biased political reviews in this forum. I found the book average. It wasn't so great, the research is common and the author has a strange way of interpreting the facts.This country has devolved into a place where hatred runs rampant on the Right and the Left. It's terrible. What happened to the middle?Frankly, I don't want to live in a USA where we still follow exactly what the founding fathers wanted. Slavery? No Women's rights? Kill the Native Americans? Come on, I love America as mush as the rest, but there were major flaws in their thinking.I guess I fell into my political views and not about the book. But, honestly do these reviews actually influence anyone? Either you like this guy or not. I doubt many actually even have read the book."
1,Right-Wing Propaganda,"It would be hilarious if it weren't so dangerous. The right-wingers have no shame, and are content to attempt to rewrite history in order to further their political agenda. Truly pathetic that something this transparently fictitious and misleading could be taken seriously at any level by anybody who understands history."
4,Original intent,"I bought this book about a month ago on Amazon. I had been reading it three weeks before i got it on a recommendation from a school teacher. This book is packed full if information and that makes it a difficult read, the person who recommended it is having a hard time reading it. If you love the truth and want to know what was intended for this country by the constitution, This book is for you, but be prepared to read through more than once so you can take everything in. This book shows how far south we've gone in the rights we have as citizens and how the supreme court turned into a theology board."
5,Very eye opening,"I must admit that when I orignally received this book I was not sure what was in the pages. I realized the book was written by the relgious side of the house. As I read it, it did intrique me and did make alot of excellent points. There are many view points in our world and the intent of this book is to expose us to little known facts and information. Since completing my reading I have decided to pass it to another person in hopes they will do the same. A very good book and worth the effort to read."
5,Original Intent,"This is an excellent read, it opened a new appreciation for the intelligence of our Founders,the Constitution,and the Declaration of Independence. I now have a better understanding of the two aspects of natural law which are embodied in the Declaration's phrase ""the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God"" - the phrase the Founders invoked as the legal basis for their separation from Great Britain."
5,Second Best Book Ever Written,"This book is so interesting. Nothing but original documents were used to research this book. It is written so well you cant put it down. This has to be the most important book ever written with regards to the founding of our country. No wonder the liberal socialist reviews have their panties in a bunch, the truth is exposed and proven. Bad for them, when everyone starts to learn the truth. I have bought this book six times and keep giving away copies. My MD loved it, but he is not the foot cutting off kind of doctor. America is waking up. Thank God. I loved it so much, I ordered every book David Barton has written. Now I am ordering another copy of Original Intent for myself. Thank you David."
4,I Bought This Book Because There Are So Many Amazon Reviews Against It,"I like controversy and debate. Look at all the negative one star reviews against this book; it's a must read, just based on that fact alone. Kudos! buy the book and enjoy fact finding for yourself."
5,Love it!,"I agree that the dragons cover the numbers and letters on the plate, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Stylish and unique, especially around where I live. I've had people ask me where I got it and that I must've payed a fortune for it, but all I could tell them is that I found it in my garage. lol"
5,CAT MAGIC,"This book is a fantastic collection of wit and rowdy artistic risk. Albert Van Troba's artwork is vibrant and alive. The riddles are smart and well planned. The riddles work together to spin an outrageous family tree of cats! Buy this book, whether you like cats or not! You will be pleased."
1,Not cat proof,Cat Mate feederMy cat figured real fast how to open it before the scheduled time. Is there any ways the company could improve the product. It is useless to me now!
3,The new Margie Adams,"I have Margie's original recording of most of this music from the 80s on another CD I bought about a year ago and on an old cassette. Margie's voice (like that of Tony Bennett) has lost it's spirit. Most of us lose something as we age.... I continue to enjoy her inspiring songs, and plan to send the better CD along with my original copy of Margie's Songbook to my granddaughter Jenna who is a singer. Kate Russell"
5,Memoirs of a Papillon,"I met Genevieve and Dennis one day by accident in Sarasota and I have since read ""her memoirs"". Absolutely delightful!"
5,"My Papillon, Nicki, must have read this book!","I read this book before our dog, Nicki, adopted us. She could be Genevieve in disguise, because she has all the same traits and personality. The first time she hit me in the back of the leg in that spot that buckles your knee, I remember how Genevieve described that exact tactic to get her humans attention. It was eerie! A great read whether you are a dog owner or not."
5,Memoirs of a Papillon,"This is the funniest book, written by Genevieve, the tiny Papillon! I laughed out loud quite a few times! She has a new book that just came out, as well as MORE Memoirs..."
5,Memoirs of a Papillon: The Canine Guide to Living with Humans without Going MaD,"GREAT BOOK. I'm a papillon owner and a friend gave me a copy of ""Genevieve's"" book. I laughed till my sides ached. I read it in oneevening and then read it again. I've watched my papillons ""zoom"" aroundthe house and act just like Genevieve. I've purchased several copies to give to friends as gifts."
3,William Is Not What It Appears,"William and the Magic Ring is a well-written 62 line poem. The story addresses children's night-time fears and shows them to be only shadows. The laser cut images are clear and cast good shadows on the wall. The book, however, is not the 32 pages that the description says it is. Due to the nature of a shadow book, it is one-sided. This book is really only printed on 16 pages. The other 16 pages are the blank backs. If you do not mind paying quite a bit for such a small short story, it is well done."
2,evil pictures,"I like the construction and the idea, even the story, but there are 3 of the pages that are pretty evil looking. The jackle has sharp teeth and hair standing on the back of its neck. The page with the other animals in the forest following the crow, looks like ghost images. I read the reviews and some even said it was good for 3 year olds. Well, it makes me feel a little uncomfortable reading this to my 3 year old. If I had been able to see these pictures I definately would have not bought this particular shadow book for her."
1,False Positive!!,"I just finished my first IVF and bought these tests to see if it had worked and if I was pregnant. Imagine the emotional roller coaster ride... the first test on Sunday came out negative. I did the test again Monday morning with first urine and it came back ""PREGNANT""- I was thrilled and convinced that the IVF had worked. Then, I went down to my Dr. at Stanford to go get a blood test to confirm and while there, started my period. What an incredible let down. I thought this thing was supposed to be ACCURATE! What a waste of money... best to always go get blood pregnancy test done. I will never make that mistake again. The pain of thinking you are pregnancy because of this idiot device and yet finding out that you aren't.. too much."
1,This thing is GARBAGE!,"I took a pregnancy test two days after my period was suppose to start and it came up negative. Four days after my period was suppose to start I took another test. It said ""Pregnant"". I did not get excited because I read all the bad reviews on Amazon. I took another test the same evening and it came up negative. I am going to get my money back from EPT."
4,Good choice from the local drugstore,"I knew from my research that this wasn't absolutely the most accurate test out there, but it's one of the most accurate you can find at your local drugstore. I used the dip-in-the-cup method, which is easily the cleanest way to test with over-the-counter pregnancy tests. The double pack comes with two sticks and a reusable digital reader.Fast, easy to use, and certainly no questions at all about the results with the digital interpreter. I had my answer in less than 5 minutes from beginning to end.Most importantly, I would use this test again."
1,Error,"My period is a couple of days late and Im dying to know if I was pregnant or not.I am not trying to get pregnant, and it's nothing i've been thinking about. I told my boyfriend that we might have a baby and he got nervous, yet a bit excited. I bought the test, opened the package and the screen read....""see leaflet""....yea! A couple of minutes later the screen semed to be ok and I took the test. Nope, the screen says error. I wait 30minutes, take the test again. And it says NOT PREGNANT. Well, now it's a week later and my period still hasn't started. So, I'm forced to take another test. It will not be a EPT one, wich I concidered a waist of money!"
1,False Positive,"My period was late and I got a ""Pregnant"" result. So when I started bleeding later the same week I thought I was having a miscarriage. I had blood work done and an ultrasound only to find out I was never pregnant and that I was just starting my period. So disappointing."
5,Detected pregnancy 5 days before the hospital!!,"I love these tests!! I love the fact that the use words and that you don't have to go off of the lines, which are so annoying!! I found out I was pregnant using EPT, and then I went to the Dr. to get tested and it took them 5 days and 1 urine tests and 2 blood tests to tell me I was pregnant. I also tried First Response and it took a week after EPT to come up positive. I will always use EPT now!!"
1,Terrible gamble,"I am three days late on my period. I woke up this morning and was dying to know if I was pregnant or not. So I ran around and bought the EPT Digital Readout Test. When I got to work, I opened the package and the screen read....""see leaflet""....yea! Another customer screwed by a low battery. Do not buy unless you want to gamble away 14-16 dollars!"
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would...","It had been 8 weeks since my last period, I thought it might have been due to stress because my fiance and I only had sex a few times, not around ovulation times. Took the test, got two NOT PREGNANT results. Two weeks later, still no period, went to a walk-in clinic for a blood test, and what do you know? I'm pregnant."
1,False Positive,"Took this test yesterday morning and was excited to receive a ""Pregnant"" result after trying to conceive for 3 years. We called our doctor and went in for a blood test to confirm the same day, and the blood test came back negative. Took a Clearblue Easy digital test this morning and got a ""Not Pregnant"" result. Very disappointing to get our hopes up and then find out it was a false result. EPT did refund our money spent on the test when we called the 800 number on the box. I thought EPT was supposed to be the best, but I won't be purchasing it again."
1,False Positive!,"I bought the test. Used one of them about 8 months ago and it worked fine. I still had another one left. I thought I might be pregnant so I took the test. After a few seconds ""Pregnant"" flashed on the screen. I went the next day to the doctor to confirm results and their test said negative. I took another home test different brand and it also said negative. I guess over time the test went bad. Very frusterating and emotional!!"
1,still don't know,"I had an odd period, so thought I should get a test just in case. The first time I tried I peed on the stick and absolutely nothing happened. No error message, no result, just blank. Having wasted the urine, and feeling a little upset, I popped open the test to look at the actual strip inside. 2 lines. On other tests thiswould indicate a positive result, but I couldn't be sure with this test. About 6 hours later I took the other test. The digital screen told me I am ""not pregnant"". Feeling now that I couldn't trust the digital screen, I popped open the test to check the strip. Again, 2 lines. A day of testing and $15 later I still have no idea if I'm pregnant. I have 2 kids, and this is the first time I have even been unsure about the result of a pregnancy test."
5,we read biographies of ancient Kadampa practitioners,"Hi everyone, I've just read, and was thoroughly gripped by thewonderful book - ""The Life of Milarepa - Tibet's Great Yogi"" byLobzang Jivaka (Llanerch Publishers,ISBN 1 897853 63 7). Geshe-lasuggests we read biographies of ancient Kadampa practitioners to beinspired and the book certainly did that for me.I highly recomend it.I was wondering if there were any books of other famous practitionersthat people had read and loved, maybe for:Je TsongkhapaBuddha Shakyamuni (I know there are thousands of these - but a goodone that you've read and loved)NaropaNagarjuna"
1,Little value for high cost,"This slim (62 page) softback book is certainly not worth $[...]. I'm a long time Amazon customer and am returning a product for the first time in 8 years. Self-published by the author (I will certainly check for this in the future), this book's content consists of musings (few), white space (a lot), photos (some fuzzy, few high quality) and prints (buy one of the author's digital images for $[...]). What a disappointment. I was looking for some in depth, poetic essays on San Miquel in preparation for my first-time visit. There was nothing here to cast even a shadow on the essence of this city."
2,Scent is a little weird,Not their best. But it depends on what you're into. They have better scents available in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend.
1,Not Original Packaging,"This Aura Cacia Essential Oil did not come in the original manufacturer's packaging. I have purchased this brand from local stores numerous times and it comes in a small box - which is also very helpful to store the bottle in as it gets oily sometimes. It was also not quite as full as normal. It is disturbing to me that something you use on or in your body would not come in the original packaging, I have to wonder if the bottle was refilled with a lesser product. I would like to return the product but haven't figured out how to not pay for the shipping which I don't feel I should have to since I consider it defective. I would give a positive recommendation to the Aura Cacia brand as I have used it frequently."
3,"Good Book, but there are better","This is a good book, but the best by far is the U.S. Army Survival Manual."
3,Good if you are not in a megalopolis,"I think this book is very good for certain situations, but I feel that it does not meet the needs of most average folks in case of major catastrophy.I would recommend Ron Foster's practical guide for all scenarios. Since he works in the field of emergency response, he has the most up to date and useful methods of urban and rural survival.If you seriously want to learn more than ""how to live off the land"" short term, I would highly recommend Mr. Foster's publication, ""The Rural Ranger: A Suburban Manual & Field Guide of Traps and Snares for Food and Survival"".I know how to live off the land if one can even get to such a ideal location, but hunger, thirst and the elements will wear out the millions of people trying to vacate their huge cities all at once.This book gives one a fighting chance no matter what your skills are or where you live.Seriously,David Highum"
4,"a reliable standard, along with US gov't pubs","Pretty fair, illustrations good, maybe a little more expansive on first aid, snares and improvised equipment than FM 21-76, some stuff on vehicle operation that is sketchy but useful and often not in these books, I would put Wiseman on a par with FM 21-76 (Army) overall, though I almost agree with the reviewer that found 21-76 better; I also would add that AFR 64-4 (Air Force)is great as well, though not very portable. Scanning the books on my shelves, I see these three are falling apart while the others of this sort look hardly used."
1,"First this is NOT a ""SAS"" survival handbook","First this is NOT a ""SAS"" survival handbook but a book written by John ""Lofty"" Wiseman who got out of the SAS in 1985.... Yeap real up to date.... here it says he was in for 26 years and he is on youtube saying 27 years and he states he got out in 1985. The book uses the name SAS as if this is what the British military uses and it is NOT. I am sure the title helps sell this book, but the content is not up to date and is lacking in many areas. The book is some what helpful but if you think your getting a true military manual from the SAS your not. There are many good military survival manuals here on Amazon."
3,"Too tiny, font is too small.",I thought I would get a regular sized book. But I was wrong.It is not bigger than my half palm.My mistake of not reading the product dimension carefully.Be sure this is the kind of size you want!
4,usefull,"I like the format I did not realize that the book is small, actually pocket sized. You could actually have this book in a survival kit. I would pull off some pages that are pretty basic. i have to say I ahve not finished reading. Browsed, now going through throughly. Overall worthwhile"
4,Great Survival handbook,This is a great book for beginners and pros alike. It gives you the very basics to save you time in emergencies or just surviving the outdoors. Will keep this book handy for years to come.
3,Good but kinda stupid...,"I bought this book with an interest in outdoor survival and picking this one out at the book store. Started off with bood points and it's bad points. Good points were the pictures of everything from edible plants to animal tracks. Some of the bad stuff was going against common sense. Like saying you should have a survival kit on your person while in an airplane in case of a crash. 2 of the most important things for survival would be a blade and a source of fire such as a lighter or matches, neither of which you can take on board an airplane. And when talking about polar travel and survival in talks about polar bears. It says respect them not don't go near them. It also says don't eat their liver...now if I just went through something that put me in the situation to be around polar bears in the artic regions, I don't think I would have anything I would challenge a polar bear. And if I killed one, the first thing I would say would surely be ""I can't wait to get that liver!!!"""
1,Not as Good as the Army Survival Manual,"Good title but that is about it for this book, compared to the U.S. Military."
3,Considered the Wilderness Survival Bible but...,"Very dry reading, most topics are not covered in detail, very general direction/instruction is given. Seriously, the book covers way to much for a novice. Survival experts might find this book useful because it can give them refresher training, however, for example, the fire bow section is less than half a page. This can be misleading for a novice who might think it is just that simple. Do not buy this book if you are a novice unless you have other books to learn from first. Try everything you want to learn at home, before setting out into the bush. Make a fire in your backyard using the fire bow first, then try it in the bush with a lighter in your pocket!"
2,Disappointing,"There is a reason you see used versions of this book for sale. I was very disappointed in that it only covers 6 parks. Considering the number of state parks in Alaska, this is a pretty poor showing. Those that are covered are covered in a ""this is what I did"" vein and not in a ""this is what is available"" manner that I was expecting."
2,waste of money,Don't bother with this bag. The sparkles dont' stay on. Get it only if you're looking for a pouch to put your coins in it and keep it in a drawer (as opposed to carry it in your handbag).
3,Not Sure,"I'm not sure if I like this product yet.It's not like the usual masks I've used, such as clay masks.Used it about 4 times.I found it to be was very oily, almost like a moisture mask.The mask did not dry or harden, stayed moist and oily.Was afraid that it was actually clogging pores."
3,Really works,"Really works. All odors are gone. Small, size of glass, doesn't take too much room in regrigerator. Could be 5 stars, but a) There was no manual (how I will know that it is time to replace batteries? Sometimes LED blinks, sometimes glows solid - what this means?), b) Specs says that batteries are included. Acctually, there was no batteries"
5,RD&F,"Works fine, came with instructions. Did state somewhere that batteries were NOT included. Although somewhere else it says it does? That was a bit confusing."
1,No Advanced Concept,"In contrast to the title "" advanced concepts "", this is an introductory book. Readers waste time if they read advanced concepts chapters. Only lists of refernces are useful."
5,A good introduction to modern radar,I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a basic understanding of radar fundamentals as well as more advanced concepts. The book covers almost every aspect of modern radar and gives extensive references for in-depth study. An unique feature of the book is its thorough discussion on imaging radar and the related digital signal processing. Many of the homework problems given at the end of each chapter also help to enhance the understanding of various concepts develped throughout the book.
5,Penguin and de Tocqueville,This is a great volume of Tocqueville's monumental work describing civil society and the nature of governmental interactions in early 19th Century United States. I highly recommend this volume!
3,abridged edition,"When I ordered Democracy In America, I thought I was getting a full translation of the French classic. However, this edition is abridged. There seemed to be no indication of this in the information offered on the website. It should be noted that this edition is abridged."
5,Excellent for history buffs,"My rating is for history buffs and history majors. For others, I would give it three starts.Alex gives you a lot of perpective and appreciation for this country and its origins. The book is from the perspective of a Frenchman during the formation of our country, and also let europeans know of his thoughts."
3,book,"A so-so book as far as reading material goes, I guess it is all dependent on perspective and political views."
3,Oops,"935 page book with no index.Come on, you don't need one.You can remember that part about the aristocracy of the law...was just about here...Or was it here...Don't worry, I've got it...Just a sec..."
2,"the text is fine, the condition of the book otherwise","The book was tattered and was obviously haggard.it's a classic, but i don't see why the crap damaged copies must be sent to me"
1,DEMOCRACY WHERE?,"In America? In 1831? Which part of America EXACTLY did this man visit? Which ""Americans"" did he talk to? Did he talk to blacks? Did he talk to sharecroppers? Did he talk to the industrial fodder that were dying in the factories of the north?I never understood why this book was so impressive except that it helped to perpetuate the myths of the building of America."
3,4 views of egalitarianism to some degree,"This is a Good Book but it is basically from a functionally egalitarian perspective. Even the complementarians are not truely complementarians..courage and a strong biblical stance seems to be lacking in this treatment of such a vital issue.I liked the book for what it is-which is a book in favor of some degree of egalitarianism. I found the book helpful in seeing the progression of error in relation to the issue of ""Women in Minsitry"" but I would not suggest this book for someone who thinks that they are going to get a true picture of biblical complementarianism even though there are several sound principles that can be gleaned from the text by a discerning reader."
4,deju vu,"very interesting movies in the way that it can go back in time to see what has happened to figure out a crime,very well done"
4,I think I have seen this before,"Looks like a bit of terrorist hanky panky is about to take place; we get a front row first hand view of the action. The real story starts when one of the apparent victims Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) washes upon shore an hour too early. This intrigues an ATF Agent Doug Carlin (well acted by Denzel Washington.) During the investigation Doug starts to fall in love with the victim (yes this has happened before in ""Laura"" with Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney -Déjà Vu.)The question is will life and technologies allow Doug to make a small correction to future history? Or is this a world of ""what will be will be""?This film has a lot of good explosive action and beautiful people that just can not be replaced by CGI. And don't overlook the acting ability of Val Kilmer.The Sticky Fingers of TimeSomewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)"
3,Problems with playback,"The movie and storyline was good and kept us entertained. My problem was with the DVD itself. The playback had problems and got 'stuck'/froze at the start of the movie. The only way to get the movie to play was to advance to chapter two and then rewind to the beginning of the movie (without going all the way back to 0:00:00 or the problem would re-occur). I have an ONKYO DVD player and have never had this problem with it, it still plays all of my other movies just fine. I did have the exact same thing happen with 'The Queen'. Both of these movies are by Disney companies, could it have to do with the mastering/copy protection? It was very frustrating having to watch the first five minutes or so in rewind before being able to see the movie."
4,DejaVu review,"DejaVu is a ride on a roller-coaster called: creative suspense. Some very imaginative ideas were interspersed into this plot, which offers glimpses of ""Minority Report""'s futuristic crime solving, but Denzel Washington gives a performance a step (or two) above Tom Cruise's version. The sequence of events peaks the imagination in DejaVu, and supplies well enough camoflaged leads, that makes the production a progression of links into the climax, transitions that are as smooth as possible, with only a minimal amount of fragmentational scenes which never seem to add-up. Its a difficult theme to digest, even after the movie. The whole idea tooses back and forth from being Far-fetched, to anything's possible, and Denzel is a key ingredient for making DejaVu's mysterious premis as believable as it could ever get. Acting is excellent, Action is adequate, Suspense is sometimes subtle, but alwayspresent."
4,New version of timecop,"If anyone remembers the movie timecop starring Jean claude van dam, then you will see a lot of similarities in the two movies. Both movies have the federal agent going back in time to alter a crime, and just so happen to save a woman. The difference between the two is that deja vu is a better version with better actors and a better plot. Even though the plot isn't totally original it still manages to entertain and make you wonder what will happen next. The movie is very good (as most of denzel's movies usually are) and is highly recommended."
2,DEJA VU GIVE MY MONEY BACK IN TIME PLEASE!!!,"WHAT A WASTE OF HOUR AND HALF OF MY LIFE, THIS MOVIE SUCK AND BIG WAY, iN THE BEGINNING, THE FIRST EXPLOSION AT THE FERRY LOOKS VERY FAKE CGI STUFF, AND THE WHOLE EXPLANATION OF THE TIME TRAVEL MACHINE (LOOKS LIKE A GIANT INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY MACHINE) AND DONT FORGET ABOUT OF THE AMAZING DUMB FINALLE. THE WORST OF ALL IS THE SEVERAL GOOD REVIEWS THAT THIS MOVIE HAD, ITS LIKE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT MOVIE ANALYSIS. WHAT A WASTE OF FILM REEL AND ACTORAL WORK (DENZEL WASHINGTON).I'LL LIKE THAT THIS REVIEW MADE SOMEBODY REGRET OF WATCH THIS FIASCORAMA.[...]."
2,Giant Plot Holes,"I often will have a willing suspension of disbelief in films just for entertainment, but this puts that willingness to the limits. I love thew sci-fi principle of time travel in this film... what I have a problem with is the tremendously flawed logic that the characters have. The chief flaw is the centering on a single character, played by Denzel Washington of course, to thwart a horrific terrorist attack. If any normal person were put in a similar situation as these supposed geniuses, they'd take much more obvious... much more logical decisions. Such ridiculous plot devices are a bit hard to swallow, despite how well crafted the movie may be."
3,Deja Vu,"Deja Vu is a good Movie. I recomend it, if you like stuff about time travel, a good ending, and Denzel Washington you 'll like this movie. I only gave it three stars because it's not the kind of movie I would like to see over and over again."
4,DeJavu,"The story line was interesting , different and exhilarating. Unique movie allowing one to see the possibilities of things to happen with computer technology, and get one to wonder if it is possible to change happenings with cutting edge technology of computers. The sound and picture quality is excellent with the Blu-ray format."
5,This Rocks !!!,I have to say was entertaining.The premise was silly and Denzel Washington has played this role before in alot of his movies.There is no escaping the fact that the movie looks and sound excellent on blu-ray. You would be stupid if didn't add this movie to you collection.It's one of the best Blu-ray title on the market.You won't be disappointed.
1,Deja-Crap,"This movie had me going right up until the final act, and then I watched it spiral out of control, as story and acting took a terrible u-turn and crashed on landing.Now I'm not a big Denzel fan, but for the first 2/3rd of the film, he actually did a pretty good job. But whether it was the writer or the director(horrid want-to-be as good as my brother, Tony Scott), the last 30 minutes left me and my girlfriend shouting at the screen, ""Move your butt, aren't there people to save!"".It's been awhile since I've viewed a movie where you can actually pinpoint the moment where everything derails, and all concept of time and logic is lost in the ashes.Avoid this one."
3,Not A Cool Movie,"Denzel Washington in this movie is way too emotional and not nearly as cool as in other movies like ""Training Day"". He was basically a stalker!Another thing I didn't like about this movie is the computer graphics. The director must have believed we will think the past viewer CG so cool and like it so much that he used it over and over again. On the contrary, I feel slightly insulted to be thought of that way. I like computer graphics in movies that are used to reproduce reality to show spectacular scenes that cannot be shot otherwise, like those in Star Wars episodes. However, I loath CG used as if it were something cool, e.g. CG on computer user-interface. When PCs are so ubiquitous these days everybody can tell a good user-interface from a bad one. And bad ones are not cool to me, no matter how much computer graphics you put into it. They should have just showed the past viewer as a Windows-based application as would be developed in research institutions in reality today."
1,Talk about Deja Vu,"I feel like this movie has been made before, hence the name. Can you say unoriginal??It's stuff like this that makes me not want to take the wife and rugrats to the cinema anymore?"
2,"DEJA VU EXCELLENT, I JUST KIDDING ITS SUCK BIG TIME","WHAT A WASTE OF HOUR AND HALF OF MY LIFE, THIS MOVIE [...]AND BIG WAY, iN THE BEGINNING, THE FIRST EXPLOSION AT THE FERRY LOOKS VERY FAKE CGI STUFF, AND THE WHOLE EXPLANATION OF THE TIME TRAVEL MACHINE (LOOKS LIKE A GIANT INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY MACHINE) AND DONT FORGET ABOUT OF THE AMAZING DUMB FINALLE. THE WORST OF ALL IS THE SEVERAL GOOD REVIEWS THAT THIS MOVIE HAD, ITS LIKE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT MOVIE ANALYSIS. WHAT A WASTE OF FILM REEL AND ACTORAL WORK (DENZEL WASHINGTON).[...]."
1,this movie is AWFUL!!!,"this movie is terrible. I imagine this will be the new form of torture, being forced to watch really stupid movies. Yet a lot of people actually like this film. HAHAHA sheep."
2,It's been a while since I saw something as bad,"This is a really bad movie.I love movies and I have giving bad reviews, but this one deserves it.D. Washington gave a standard performance. He acts pretty much the same in every movie.The time machine related stuff.. dunno, I am no physicist, but the explanations just didn't seem believable. And in this particular movie believability is important.And then scripting and rhytm.. it has ups and downs, coupld of times it comes down to a standstill. Its an action movie, shouldn't get boring, ever.And it was boring. Too bad, cuz the idea is not bad."
4,"High Concept, not quite brilliant","I give it four stars instead of 3 because the concept was so strong--I don't give that away here. I think it's probably possible that at some time in the future we will be time traveling.Funny how Deja Vu and ""Next"" (Nicholas Cage) are similar and out at the same time.A solid base hit for Washington, no breakthrough here. Fans of Denzel will be happy. A good escape flick.Tony Scott's camera work is as usual off the hook."
2,Deja Phew,"Deja Vu is about a man who is on this mission to get facts about a bombing that takes place in some remote dock out. There is time travel involved in the film. There is a lot of detective work and dragging storylines around this film. There is little or nothing ""cool"" about this film. I almost slept shortly before the intermission. I know there are a gazillion Denzel Washington fans and all; I can respect that but seriously, guys, WHAT A BAD FILM. This film reminded me of XXX 2. And readers, Van Helsing was a better film than Deja Vu and that is saying a lot without saying much."
2,A Bit Too Far Fetched,"When a New Orleans ferryboat is destroyed by a terrorist bomb, killing most of the people onboard, ATF agent Doug Carling (played by Denzil Washington), is sent to investigate. The mystery deepens when a young womans body is found, near the scene of the crime, yet the evidence indicates she died a few hours before the explosion.I thought this movie started off quite interesting, as Carling gets his teeth into the investigation, but once the technological parts of film 'kicked in', it got a bit too far fetched for my liking. As the movie progressed it got more and more ridiculous, and I feel the 'technology' bits would have worked better, if it had of been set a few years into the future. Not even Denzil can save this one!"
4,Good film,"Yeh thanks for amazon telling us almost the entire plot!Good film, starts off with a terrorist attack on a boat full of sailors and their families and Denzel tasked to investigate it. He hooks up with a suvailance crew who claim that they have cameras that set up at every angle can give a 360 degree veiw of events but only 4 days in the past.It is at this point you start to yawn and the old interest starts to go as a bunch of geeks are buisy spying on people you start thinking to yourself ""You know its still early maybe I should have gone out after all"" When the twist in the story comes in 'time travel'Without going into too much of the story our Denzel jumps into action to save the day. Does a good job and you are begining to thinnk to yourself ""Is this going to be another 'man on fire'?"" But no, it has a pretty good ending to boot.Overall the acting is exellent and their is enough action in the film to keep you happy. A good film well worth watching."
5,Well-worth the time and money,"This was actually a film I was reluctant to see, mostly because I knew it had to do, in some part, with time traveling. Which is extremely difficult to pull off consistently and realistically, and most people fail when they try. In this movie, they didn't fail. They managed to make all the pieces fit together, and they made a very fun (albeit far fetched) enjoyable movie to watch.Add to that the superb acting of everyone in this movie (Denzel Washington plays his role to a T) and it's one of the most solid movies I've seen in awhile. It's not *special* enough to be Oscar quality, but its a movie you can enjoy watching again and again without getting bored or tired of it. And that's worth a lot, in my opinion. :)"
4,Suprisingly Good Movie!,"I'm a very big fan of Denzel Washington, who caused me to really appreciate his work and amazing presence watching ""Glory and Training Day"". Unfortunately over the last 2-3 years, he really hasn't come out with anything I'd call worth more than a trip to the $1.00 rental store. This movie really kept my interest and though some parts were rather cheesy, I actually found myself wanting more towards the end. Though certainly not his very best work, it's for sure a sturdy bridge to his eventual mega hit in the near future (let's hope). Check it out, I think you'll really like it."
2,Denzel vs Jesus Caviezel + Val,"This movie stunk. It was full of time travel and all the twist and turns that come with the possibilities. But of course we have seen it all before a million times (can you say 12 Monkey's?). The movie has a great cast and it is a shame to see Denzel, Jesus Caviezel and Val 'I am washed up and not even trying anymore' Kilmer wasted in this stinky doo doo."
3,Round peg in a square hole,"Denzel Washington is my favorite actor, so it hurts me to see him in movies that don't live up to his talent. I do, however, have to give them credit for coming up with an interesting spin on the whole ""time-travel-space-time-continuum"" thing. (It's kind of like ""The Butterfly Effect"" meets ""The Terminator."") How they integrated this into the story, however, seemed forced and it never really meshed--kind of like a round peg in a square hole. Washington, however, saves the film from being a complete flop.Ultimately, DV is a sci-fi movie that wants to be taken seriously and it just doesn't work."
2,"Amongst all the good, it really just asks for too much...","Okay, look, I agree if you stick it through ""everything does pull together"" in the end and there is the usual fine and polished acting from Denzel, but did anyone really believe the time travel? You know, the part where Denzel, whom I respect so much, was sitting in what looked like a sewer pipe with a oversized torpedo hatch-like door waiting to go be bop back in time. I'm all about cashing in my suspension of disbelief at the movies, but this bending time rubbish was handed to the audience like it was no big deal. Like, hello, doesn't all law enforcement bend time via their uber-secret projects when needed to solve terrible crimes? Overall not my cup of tea, extra star for Denzel 'cause I like him. I'd guess others will like this movie better, because it's really not terribly crafted overall, if they're will to buy the comic book parts of the story line."
3,dejavu,"Love Denzel, he's always good. Precept of film border's on science fiction. If viewer doesn't analyze whole concept, then the film was fine. Serious gaps, assumptions..weak plot. Directing is lacking - but Denzel is Denzel."
3,"Disappointing ""science/fiction"" thriller","I was expecting a lot more from Tony Scott and this ""science/fiction"" movie. I really enjoy Denzel Washington, but this plot was just too confusing and implausible. I had to watch it a few times to try to ""make it fit,"" but I still didn't understand the ending. Too many things just didn't make sense. Although the acting was fine and the premise had great possibilities, the screenwriter couldn't quite put it all together. It wasn't a very good job of either ""science"" or ""fiction."" Don't bother to watch this unless you're just dying to see Denzel in another movie."
4,If you could change the future would you?,"I seemed to get caught up in the subtle complexities of time travel films, and there are plenty of those in Deja Vu. Given the cast, great performances are a given, leaving the unfolding of the story and issues of traveling through time to keep you guessing until the end.Very entertaining."
5,Mind bender!,Fantastic movie and Mr. Denzel Washington performance is great! This one keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you think. Action packed and not a dull moment anywhere right to the very end!
3,Reminds me of ....,Denzel Washington's Out of Time. He must have pushed the movie in between movies. It just doesn't cut it like his other movies. Could have been better but still worth watching.
1,Wish I could go back in time and rent some other movie,"Now, I have never given one star to a movie before. But this movie is _that_ bad. It's so absurd that it insults the viewer's intelligence. Denzel is decent, but then the movie started getting so ridiculous at one point that I gave up.. right when Denzel went back in time by four days and started chasing the bomber... go figure! Oh, it also seemed like he was falling in love with the girl who is already dead (or is she?) by watching videos of her taking shower and changing clothes. I guess by the end of the movie, she will get back to life again and fall in love with Denzel.This movie is plain stupid. I'm surprised it has a 4 stars rating on amazon. If you want to watch a good time-travel, sci-fi movie, I recommend12 Monkeys (Special Edition)"
1,By the numbers - predictable,"I'd sum up the experience of seeing this mediocre film as: predictable, you have seen it all before, and it's a thin story idea. The actors had all of the correct facial expressions at all times, to match the dialogue - hopefully they weren't paid too much for doing this. That's about it. (A friend lent this to me, so I'm glad I didn't buy it.)"
1,very very predictable and painfully unbelievable plot,"This movie is very predictable and has a painfully unbelivable plot. Nicolas Cages movie, called ""Next"", is a far far better time travel movie. I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie. I mean, who would believe that you could not only see backwards in time through an LCD screen TV but that you could also alter time through that screen? I gave up on this movie 20 minutes into it."
4,Gripping,"I heard next to nothing about this movie after it was released in theaters, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it such a great watch when I saw it on dvd. Facinating storyline, great characters, enables you to ""suspend your disbelief"" enough to truly get into it and enjoy it despite it's complete basis in fiction. Kind of sci-fi, which I also didn't know. Completely engrossing."
4,Tony Scott back on point,"After Domino, I may have never watched another Tony Scott movie, but since he had Denzel Washington with him again, I gave it a shot, because I for one had really liked Man on Fire.Deja Vu, is a pretty good, but not quite great film dealing with quauntum mechanics, terrorism and paradox.This is one of the better films around dealing with such topics, it worked hard to keep the details making sense, but did not really grab me the way Man on Fire did. Well worth a watch, not for younger kids, but a pretty good movie."
5,One of the best British Blues albums EVER !!!,"If I had to choose between 5 TOP British Blues albums, this will be one of the 3 firsts. This album is A MUST in every blues collection, an it helps us to understand how the British blues was born. It is also a MUST for any guitar player, not only blues guitar players, 'cause PETER GREEN here shows how a white man can make a guitar cry.This is also the album that Gary Moore was trying to imitate in his great album Blues for Greeny.Don't think twice and buy it RIGHT NOW !"
5,Recommended reading for anyone with an interest in the history and socio-economics of St. Louis,"Hidden Assets: Connecting The Past To The Future Of St. Louis by Richard Rosenfeld (Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice, University of Missouri-St. Louis) is a historical and analytical study of the metropolitan area of St. Louis and its rich and colorful past, as well as providing a practical understanding of its future, and the challenges it may soon be facing in industry, economy, and demography. Providing a concise study of the past years, of city growth which could well serve as a template for similar studies of other American cities, Hidden Assets deftly delves into the living past of the great river city of St. Louis, Missouri. and is recommended reading for anyone with an interest in the history and socio-economics of St. Louis."
4,Excellent resource for anyone plagued with chronic back pain,Wealth of information for back pain suffers. Written in an easyto read and understand format. Excellent reference for answering manyquestions about alternative and standard type treatments. Have purchased additional copies of this book to give to friends and my physical therapist.
3,"A.Weiss, author of the BackSmart Fitness Plan","If your doctor did not explain why you suffer from back pain, this book is a good start. The terms and information while general will give the reader an overall outlook on thier pain and I suggest picking up other books on how to solve thier problem."
5,Excellent Resource,"""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Healing Back Pain"" is an excellent resource for those suffering from back pain. I initially used this book as a source for an article I was writing about chronic back pain, focusing only on the treatment sections, which assess both traditional and ""alternative"" therapies. But this book has more to offer: it presents clear, concise direction about ways to avoid, live with, and recover from back pain, in addition to basic facts about back structure and posture. The straight-forward writing, abundance of information, and useful blurbs within chapters make this an ideal reference guide for anyone interested in back health."
5,Incredible Time Saver for Decorating Your Home,"I bought this book during a remodel of our home. I still have it and use it for all my decorating. The pocket pages are the best for storing samples and the grid design is great for showing your room to perspective contractors. If you take it with you shopping, you will have all your information and color swatches with you for every project. It makes a wonderful gift for a new home owner, or for that first apartment."
1,Used-Very Good means torn and terrible!,Length:: 0:56 MinsI wouldn't have even choosen a star for this review but it makes u choose at least one! I hope I loaded the video correctly so that u can see the condition it is in...terrible!
3,Alert to the features of good English,"If you just want to grasp the gist of the book, take a look at the ""POINTS TO REMEMBER"" at the end of each chapter. I think they are well written for everyone to understand easily.You would definitely learn a lot if you could digest all the examples and practice all the exercises provided in the book. Even though you couldn't, like me, you can still get concrete ideas about some main features of good English, which can make you more alert to how well, or poor, people are expressing themselves, and also more alert to the way you are expressing yourself. I believe once we are aware of those good features, we can try our best to pick them up and integrate in our writing style.Nevertheless, it does take patience and basic linguistic knowledge (for those who learn English as a secondary language) to truely appreciate the full content of the book."
5,This is one of my favorite episodes!,"Even though I was too young too remember when Little House was originally on the air, I started watching the reruns a few years ago. I was hooked from the very beginning. Melissa Gilbert is one of my favorite actresses if not my favorite. I love the work she did on Little House and that's why this episode is one of my very favorites. She and Dean Butler(Almanzo)really shine through. I watch this episode whenever it comes on TV and then I can't wait till it comes on again. If you are thinking of purchasing an episode of Little House on the Prairie, I strongly recommend this one."
2,"Love Wilder, can't stand Landon's schmaltz & ego","Sorry to dissent from the fan-fest for LHOTP lovers, but I just can't take the schmaltz that Michael Landon put into these movies, especially in the later years. Worse, he deviated so far from the original stories that the characters and situations are unrecognizable. The first movie (where is it? Out of print? It's the only one true to the books and without a weepfest every 15 minutes!!)was good, and I watched the series religiously as a child, but my gosh, Landon turned the later years into male bonding sob fests. Alfred (nonexistant in books!) becomes a major character, and he and Pa get most of the attention...I guess I'm a minority viewpoint, but don't mistake these made for TV movies for a Laura Ingalls Wilder experience. Read the books."
2,No one here is talking about the quality of this DVD,"It seems like people here are reviewing the BAD tour and Michael Jackson, forgetting that this place is for the DVD review.So let me tell you, MJ is brilliant, BAD tour fantastic! With that being said, the quality of this DVD sucks! Common, VHS tape transfer? Really they couldn't do better than that?For the first time ever I felt like returning a MJ product! So buyers be aware, this will look pretty bad on your flat screen TVs! Sound is great though.I'm looking forward to the next 10-15 years when someone will ""find"" a decent footage of the BAD tour and release it on blu-ray."
3,Just okay if you are a Fan,"This was not the best. Okay if you are an M.J. Fan.Your money is better spent on the ""This Is It"" DVD."
5,MJ,"What's not to like about MJ. I love evrything about him, needless to say I'm a diehard fan. Needless to say since his passing I try to get my hands on everything MJ. The price was right for this product and it shipped quickly. I would purchase from this merchant again!!"
4,A good DVD of MJ at the top of his game.,"A good DVD of MJ at the top of his game. He was planning to return to London to do the ""This is It"" concerts."
3,Got it for My Daughter,She had a sudden interest for some reason in this cd. She enjoyed it. She is 15 and is too young to have seen his dancing in his time.
4,great tape,only thing negative about this tape which is really not woth talking about is that michael strut aroun like a chicken just a little too muchbut he is still the greatest of all time and this tape is awesome and worth buyingalot of thigs/material in this dvd packageget it
3,Latest concert video,"Would be much better with HD audio, but I do understand the limitations with the source material. Seems like they just put this out to make another quick buck on MJ."
4,Very enjoyable,This DVD is worth seeing as Michael is no longer with us. A great concert as always. Something to remember him by.
1,Lightweight book on LDAP,"Very thin. One of the most basic uses for LDAP is to setup an address/contacts book. The example in the book didn't even work and was thin on getting things like the postal address to work across multiple programs.I managed to get my project done using web resources, magazine articles. No thanks to this book. After using the OpenLDAP site for help, I got a very weak address book going that held the minimum information. After launching the book into the corner of my office, I managed to get the full project done to 90% of where I want it to be.He spends so much time pointing you to different RFCs, in essence, making you do all the work. The reference to where information comes from is great. Mention the RFCs but narrow the information down to help me solve problems.I hope Oreilly can find an experienced author to re-write this book in a way that helps the people who fork over the money. I have tons of really good Oreilly books. This, however, is a poor poor poor book."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"Although it spends a lot of time talking about OpenLDAP, the version is covers is outdated. I would also have hoped to find more information about how to choose which schema's. The email section does not mention the different attempts at standardizing a schema."
4,A book well worth its price,"This book is written a while ago and it definitely needs update. It frequently refers to RFCs and states ""blah blah is not yet accepted as standard"" but probably it is accepted as one by now.The organization of this book is a little chaotic. When I read it from the chapter 1, introduction, it was still not clear what I was getting into. After reading it all, I still think the introduction was not very helpful. I don't think reading this book from cover to cover all through would help a lot.Nonetheless, after reading through this book with actual practice (installing OpenLDAP and running the examples as the book illustrated), I got good grasp of the concepts of LDAP and understanding how it works.I like its practical examples and connection to other applications.In conclusion, I feel I spent my money well on this book."
4,LDAP,I am still reading this book and it does have alot of useful information for LDAP. Coming from the Windows world of administration is misleading as to what a directory service actully is. When I started I only envisioned using LDAP for account creation (Active Directory). I had no idea that the protocol was used for a wide array of solutions in complex I.T. configurations. Although the book is good it does not have a simple step by step guide for a beginer just wanting to set up a domain as easy as it is in windows. I Still reccomend the book as a great resource!
4,Great history of LDAP and the current state,"The author is obviously very knowledgeable on LDAP and walks the reader through the history of LDAP from X.500 to the present time. The author quotes RFCs and IETF drafts when necessary, since some standards were not in place at the time of writing. This book does focus on LDAPv3, but gives advice about migration from LDAPv2, if you are still stuck in the past. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to deploy LDAP. It is also the best Kindle-ready book available on the topic of LDAP. I bought this book because another LDAP book was not available on Kindle. I am pleased with that decision and do recommend this to any Kindle owners. There were a few table formatting issues on some pages, but they were minimal. THUMBS UP!"
4,Great LDAP book!,"Great book!If you use LDAP in a serious way and need to REALLY understand the inner workings, get this book.It is clearly written, to the point, and very valuable!"
1,the worst book on ldap with great misleading title,"The writer is not putting any attention on ""Administration"" which is the title of the book! You will only find how to deploy LDAP and basic understanding for LDAP - and that too at primitive level.I don't know how O'reilly can start such a project. You can tell this book as just a compilation of material already out there. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY for THIS BOOK. Seriously.-Kunal"
4,Rich in History,"Though I generally dislike mystery's, I really enjoyed this book. This is and was a man's life, a real story was being told. What a great book. From the first page I was sucked in. Rips is a wonderful storyteller, knowing just the right amount of humor to throw in. Who knew that Omaha's history was so interesting. I felt that I was sitting i history class ( I love history) drinking up facts about Al Capone's ties to Omaha, brothels and slaughter houses. There were parts of the books that lagged a bit, but its still worth the read, Rips finally finds the naked woman and he finally knows the man that was his father."
3,Enjoyable if Heavy Handed,"I will start off by saying that I am an Omaha native and so a good deal of my enjoyment of this book has to do with my familiarity with the places and some of the people that the book deals with. Contrary to another perspective, I find a lot in this book plausible, or at the very least a good capturing of the many spirits of humanity that inhabit this most eccentric city. What I wish is that at times the author would have employed a lighter touch, especially in the philosophy. The connections to Levinas etc. are interesting and add to the story, but their use was a bit too heavy handed and distracted from the power of the narrative. Perhaps if the author had found a way to leave the reader some freedom to come to the connections on their own it might have been a more pleasant read. But that said, it was a very enjoyable and pleasantly quirky read."
2,"a document, sure....","A very energetic performance, no question. And good material. But -- near bootleg sound quality and a release that only profits Johnny Winter's now-despised former manager Roy C. Ames."
2,Disappointed in durability,When i first got the glove i was happy with the fit and how the glove felt while bowling. After only a few weeks the tacky parts of the gloves were coming off and now the glove is tearing in spots and larger chunks of the rubber are coming off. I only bowl one night a week so it's not like i'm bowling 12-15 games a week.
4,Works Good,I received this Glove months ago and it has not shown any signs of wear at all. It fits great and i cant bowl without it any more. I feel naked without it. I recomend this to any seriouse bowler.
2,Just repackaged 3M Scotchlite,"Sticks great, reflects great, problem is it costs about 4 times as much as a roll of 3M scotchlite(also available from Amazon)."
5,"After 19 months of use on my bike, still works great!",This tape has remained on my bike after 19 months of hard ridding. Still sticking. Still reflective. What else do you want? 'nough said.
4,"Cheap, invaluable doo wop primer","Okay, a few odd choices (the Penguins' Ookey Ook rather than Earth Angel? And no denying his roots, but what's with the Marvin Gaye choice?) Nevertheless you get more bona fide classic doo wop songs here (and mostly in excellent sound) than anyhwere else short of the expensive Doo Wop Box series. A truly ""very best"" would also include the Flamingos' Golden Teardrops and the Dells' Oh What a Night, for my money but the compiler hits the bullseye more often than not and this is certainly as comprehensive an introduction to the classic era of doo wop for the novice as you will find."
1,Nothing Gained - time lost,"Photos from different angles of a few kitchen never used to prepare a dinner for more than two people [if that].Very,very little copy on the photos.No layouts.Somewhere in the past some ideas shown may have been good as Epcot Center displays but not even applicable to a single person's basic loft needs today.Somebody got carried away with themselves when this book was published."
1,Big Designs for Small Kitchens,This picture compilation of mostly european kitchens has little practical application for everyday cooks. I bought a used copy for only $2 and still feel I wasted my money.
1,This is what gives Salespeople a bad name!,"In a nutshell, this book is awful. This guy is so cliché, I am surprised he has been successful. I have taken many legitimate sales courses that have taught me great things about dealing honestly and candidly with customers, but Tom Hopkins suggests a different approach. He espouses that, when faced with rejection, you should accuse the customer of not trusting you or your companies integrity and to ""guilt"" them into giving in. This is NOT how professional salespeople become successful. Give me a break, buddy! Go back to selling steak knives door-to-door."
4,Recent purchase,"The wife wanted it, I ordered it and it came without any difficulty as usual with products from Amazon. Thanks."
1,Beginner writer or Beginner's JSP Guide,Read this book last weekend. Should have watched Simpsons reruns instead. Found the book to be tedious. Didn't really step me through any sort of learning process....Not for beginners!
5,Perfect addition to my 4x4,"Truck: 2004 F150 6"" Fabtech Lift, 35x12.50x20 nitto mudgrappler tires with 20"" ProComp Xtreme Wheels.Proper research will indicate that this kit is for a fabtech 6"" lift on an f150.I installed this kit in about 30 minutes with minimal effort and tools.I would remove the tires as I attempted with them on and it was more difficult.I can now hit any pothole without the steering wheel being jerked out of my hands.This kit bolted right on and was one of the easiest installs for me to date.I highly reccomend this and all fabtech products.The price is very reasonable as well for a dual shock stabilizer system.If you are running large diameter tires and or wheels this is a must. You will not be dissappointed."
2,No synch,I purchased this product for my Married daughter because Consumer Reports rated it #2 including ease of set up.Neither she nor her husband has been able to get it in synch with her cell phone.
4,Shirley's,Like the product. I drive a lot on military installation where talking on the phone will result in a fine so it works well for me
4,Bluetooth,"I thought this bluetooth headset was a little below par as far as quality. It had static in the background whenever I used it. I gave it to my son though, and he loves it."
4,good,"I got this as a gift for my step mom who loves purple, it got to me in excellent time and it works as good as any motorola headsets:)"
1,worst bluetooth headset!,"The sound quality is awful, very scratchy sounding, does not recognize voice command, overall bad product!"
1,Motorola Bluetooth Headset H700 Plum [Motorola Retail Packaging],Worst Bluetooth ever.... Supposed to be the high end blue tooth but I have to hold the phone to the blue tooth to keep from hearing nothing but crackling and static.(Kinda blows the Hands Free Thing that I bought it for.)Voice Commands does not work. No Ease of Use at all. Won't EVER buy again. Wish I could return it... too much money not to be able to use!
4,Good headset for the money,"This is one of the few headsets on the market that doesn't have the earbud which goes into the ear, hence this is the product of choice for those who don't like the sensation on the small rounded object in their ear canal :-)Overall, the headset provides average performance and sound quality. However, it is easy to use - just flip the boom out and the headset connects to your phone. USB charging port is handy too, you cna charge the headset from your PC or laptop or from a generic USB-tipped charger. A good deal for the price, which can probably be explained by the fact that this set has been on the market for several years now. I got my first H700 in 2007.The only annoying thing so far - relatively short battery life, only 2-3 hrs of conversation time (it will go much farther if it is just turned on but not in use). My other headset from BlueAnt averages twice the working time."
5,I've recommed this to several friends,"It is 10x better than my old one which I threw away in disgust! The directions for getting it connected were not all that clear. My cell phone carrier was no help and when I called Motorola, they were no help. After a few tech savy friends couldn't get it to connect, I went to the internet and found better instructions. Once I got it working, I'm very happy with it."
4,Loooks almost perfect,"Used these to replace my old plastic rubber end caps on my bike. Tighter fitting and look cool, however installation is a bit tricky and the screws inside were not stainless steel, as mentioned in other review. THe other person changed it though, so I guess it is feasible to make it look gleaming silver instead of dull for the screw."
1,"Sad, very sad","Anyone who takes the arguments in this book and calls them solid is so far from reality that it can't be measured. I really don't know what to say beyond this. This whole argument line is so fallacious and unbiblical as to be laughable. The ideas that are being promulgated about African people and their rhythms are not only completely sad and racist, they are based on false assumptions. Fact is, rhythm was not a dominant part of African music until into the 20th century. Folks, be real. This stuff makes Christians look bad. If you want to spend the rest of your life singing and listening to dry, soul-less and lifeless music, have at it. But don't get on your high horse and expect anyone to buy this concept. Man I wish there were a negative five rating..."
4,Let this collection of strong goddesses guide your new year,"One of the delightful gifts I got this year was the new Vallejo and Bell Fantasy Calendar. A friend who enjoys strong, sexy women, and who thinks of me as such, gave it to me. If you like said women, you will enjoy having this calendar.The pairing with his wife seems to have brought a softer edge to the muscular women that I've seen Vallejo portray in the past, and I enjoy the strong-but-not-overwhelming body forms these women have. The theme for 2002 is The Return of the Goddess. The women shown each month portray victory, victim, warrior, sorceress, spirit and more.The imagery is neither overly violent, nor overly sexual. The functional part of the calendar includes clean boxes with large print numbers. Special notations include the basic UK/US holidays."
3,Ravioli maker,"Ravioli maker was a little light on the instructions. No explanation on required thickness of pasta, so it took some experimentation to get it right."
2,Waste of time,"It really doesn't save any time. I own it but its just easier to make my own hand-cut raviolis. It is messy and clunky and you have to have the pasta sheets just right to make them go through. For all the effort to get a few sealed raviolis, you might as just make them by hand."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Lousy product. Get a manual ravioli maker and it is less hassle and produces better ravioloi. The other pasta attachments work great, just NOT this one!!!!"
2,really is a waste of money,"I used this in a pasta/ravioli class and it is NOT worth $130. First, it does take practice, but so does using a ravioli tray or making them free hand. The ravioli we made came out better using a $20 tray or free hand with a $6 fluted cutting wheel than they did on this thing. Sure, if you practice you could get it to work...but it would take less time and practice to use a ravioli tray or cutter and save you more than $100. Even when we got ""good"" with it, it was not a major time saver, in fact, I could do more by hand in less time. You could buy dozens of cool sizes and shapes with the pans for the cost of this one piece of equipment. This is one place where KitchenAid misses the mark...I will say that the roller is a lifesaver, and I will not use a hand-crank machine again...but this is a waste of money."
2,not as expected,The Ravioli maker does not work properly and only the ravioli in the midle are usable. I own a ravioli maker I purchased for $20 and it works the same.
2,It's easier to do it the classic way,"I own almost all kitchen aid stand mixer attachments and this is one of the few that I gave up using after few weeks.It's very difficult to adjust the amount of filling that goes into the sheets, and I also struggled to make the sheets air tight. After several unsuccessful attempts, I went back to the classic way of layering sheets by hand. It was not worth the $$."
1,Not Up to Standard,This is the first kitchenaid product that I have purchased that is not up to standard. The price is absorbant and the operation is to say the least laboring. You would do better to buy Batali's wheel and cutter for less than $15.00 than to pay $149.00 for this item. I have the rest of the pasta attachments for the kitchenaid and they work fantastic. I would of sent this product back but they wanted and outrageous restocking fee.
5,Pasta!Pasta!Pasta!,"Is there anything better than homemade pasta. So worth the effort and time. This contraption takes a little time to get the hang of, but once you realize that the pasta has to go through the press a good 20 times (per size adjustment),then you will have a true appreciation for the art of pasta making. A solid buy!"
1,Kitchen not aided,"This product is not as advertised... firstly you have to buy the roller which is not disclosed at purchase time... secondly, it is a manual machine, all it does is hang off the mixer, so you just as well nail it to the wall... it, and the roller, can't be washed, so it is unhygenic. But most importantly it doesn't work."
2,it will make ravioli,"but it is messy, not really easy to operate, and expensive for the level of performance. I love the Kitchen AidKitchenAid KPRA Pasta Roller Attachment for Stand Mixers, but when it comes to ravioli, I think it is cheaper and easier to make them by hand, or even with aNorpro Ravioli Maker and Press."
2,Disappointed,"We waited with great anticipation for this product to arrive but was it worth the wait and cost, NO. A big fat disappointment. It is far more trouble than it is worth. Whatever you do, do not put in anything that isn't solid, butternut squash well what a disaster, filling oozing out all over the place. Better off with cookie cutters!!!!"
1,What a total waste of money,"I am not just unhappy with this product, I am bitter about it. What a piece of trash. I've tried it, repeatedly. My friend, who was also duped into buying one by the good reputation that KitchenAid enjoys, tried it. Her husband, who can make anything work, tried it. Failure after failure after failure after failure. If you're looking to make a pot of disconnected shreds of pasta with free floating filling, this is the equipment for you. If ravioli is what you're after, you'll do better buying a can of Chef Boyardee."
2,not what expected,"It was very difficult to use.Spent several hours on it and it never did stuff the ravioli or moved the pasta through as it should. Even with it attached to the mixer,still had to hand crank the machine. Is not worth the money or time."
1,Piece of Junk,"I've been happy with many other KitchenAid products, but this one is pure junk. The pasta roller attachment that KitchenAid also offers is great, but the width of it is so close to the size of this ravioli press, that the edges of the ravioli barely have enough dough to seal - and many of them pop open.It's worth noting that although this does in fact attach to a standing mixer, it does not use the mixer's motor. You have to manually turn the crank with your hand.I returned this piece of junk, and bought the VillaWare V5500 10-Square Ravioli Maker for $18. Save yourself some money and do the same."
5,Real Time Saver!,"Heavy duty construction, simular to the old familiar hand crank model that attaches to the kitchen counter. Ravioli is a household favorite, we have used several different machines as well as the mold type. It is easy to use, simple to operate and produces a uniform product. When we make ravioli, there will be enough for a good meal and extra for the freezer for quick meals at a later time. I can see where a person would have a problem with the ravioli sealing, that will happen with any machine if your dough is too dry. Follow a good pasta recipe, and you'll have great success.Enjoy!"
2,"It works, but...","I have used several Kitchen Aid attachments, and this one is very mediocre. I received this and the pasta roller as a gift. The pasta roller is great, but the ravioli maker requires dough size that is exactly the same size as the pasta roller, many raviolis burst, and it is difficult to precisely adjust the amount of filling (some overfill if it ""grabs"" a bunch and some underfill). The ravioli size is also relatively small. It works, but you may be better off with something else (such as using the pasta roller and manual ravioli trays)."
5,Ravioli Maker,"I just made my first ravioli using this wonderful product. I practiced with no filling as was suggested by someone. This helped get the idea of how to work the attachment.I believe by rolling the pasta large enough and not overfilling the holder, you can't fail.I really do love this and my guests will enjoy the cheese ravioli I made."
2,Font incredibly small,"I liked the idea and the layout, unfortunatley, they have used a font which is incredibly difficult to read."
4,A good book,"This is a continuation of his first book and delves into some of the less significant mysteries. They will continue to be 'mysteries', but Faid explains one way in which nature could make the various mysteries happen. I enjoyed his explanations of the individual mysteries from a biblical perspective, then his relating it to the natural world. It helped me to better accept the biblical mysteries, knowing that his explanation is only one of the possible explanations. I didn't think it was mindless or senseless at all. Course, some of us don't even think Jesus is God. Those people will have a problem with this book."
1,Senseless ramblings of a deluded man,"This book is so pathetic, it almost makes me cry. Faid tries to defend his faith by twisting and bending science in all ways possible, resulting in something that is not science at all, but pure apologetics or pseudo-science. The way he approaches things, he could just as well try to 'prove' the validity of Santa Claus or the easter bunny with the same result.Books like these just make clear that things like religion aren't backed by any scientific proof whatsoever. Claiming it does so only makes things worse for religion, leading to hilarious outbursts like this book... so why bother in the first place."
2,obnoxious.,seriously all the musical numbers are compeltly annoying. their is no point to them and they totally ruin the episode. what the hell went on in the writers heads?? did they lose a bet?
2,silly,"If I had to guess, my guess would be that the writers of this episode had just seen a broadway musical and got ""inspired"". But I dont love this show because i want to see a musical. so its pretty awful."
4,GOOD SEASON,"I have all the seasons of GA and was never disappointed. This season is packed with some wonderful stories, tense moments and usual dab of humor."
3,A Maybe,"I love the show Grey's Anatomy and i wanted to catch up a little before the new season started. Unfortunately, i had more problems playing this on my Galaxy Tablet than i would have liked. If i stopped the video at anytime, i would have to restart it from the beginning in order to get it to play again. Sometimes, i would have to restart it several times to just get it to play in the first place. Not sure i would buy any more videos to download, i think i would just by the DVD instead."
2,Two bad discs,One disc skips and another disc (number 5) won't play at all. It's at one of the segments in the series I was looking forward to. Oh well
3,As it goes on.,"As Grey's Anatomy continues it journey, unfortunately, it isn't getting much better. Coming back from what happened last season, pretty good. New characters, different story lines. It's nice to see them all growing up and become people, couples, and actual doctors. I will always be a fan so of course I would recommend this."
1,This is the one after the last for me - good drama gone bad,"I own all earlier seasons of this and they were very good. I wish I had not purchased this season and am putting it up for sale. There must be entirely new writers and directors for this season, and they definitely have a social agenda. There is more attempting to focus on and 'normalize' deviant behavior than on good medical drama. I'm far from a prude, but this has become disgusting. Don't waste your money on this season"
1,CHEESY,Did alot of skipping trying to find a part where there's no singing. They just butchered this episode! It was unbearable!
3,Not a complete waste of time.,"If you are excited about trashy tv, this season is for you. If you could take or leave the soap opera scene, you may want the hours spent watching this back. Definitely my guilty pleasure, but not for everyone and not a show I would write home about.I did watch this on amazon streaming, and I had few if any trouble with the picture and sound."
3,Never a dull moment,"I thought this season was a little dry, it didn't really have the same pace as the other ones, and i would have loved to see the drama between Der and Mer start a lot earlier in the season. I am still pretty satisfied with the season and can't wait to see what happens in the fall."
5,Love it!!,"I Love that I can watch it when ever I want. I am impatient and I didn't want to wait till September when the season 7 of Greys came out on DVD, so I bought it so it would stream to computer right away. I watch it when ever I have a free time. I absolutely love it!!"
1,Worst Grey's Episode Ever!,"I am a die hard Grey's Anatomy fan. I own every season and usually love every episode....however, this episode was unbearable and by far the worst Grey's episode ever! Grey's fans do not watch the show for singing and this episode had so much potential and fell completely flat. It was so hard to watch. I really wanted to skip it all together but then I didn't want to miss anything important so I stuck with it even though it was awful. I really hope they never make an episode like this again. If I wanted to watch a musical, I would watch Glee; and if the writers wanted to make a musical, they should work for Glee. Gross!"
1,Two Words. Simply Awful.,I threw up a little in my mouth watching this particular episode. Unfortunately I can't rate this zero stars. Greys is officially in the toilet. They should fire whoever thought this was a good idea.
1,Are you kidding me?,"I love Grey's Anatomy, but HATED this episode! It was so painful to watch that I stopped after I realized the entire episode was going to be a series of ridiculous musical numbers. What the hell got into the writers, or were they on strike? PLEASE, PLEASE do not ruin another episode of this normally fantastic series!"
3,good customer service,Unfortunately some of the discs did not work but the seller immediately refunded me my money no questions asked. I understand these things happen sometimes and its nice not to be hassled.
3,Stop the music!,"This is what happens when writer and directors think they have to resort to gimmicks in order to attract an audience. Stop! This was painful to watch. I had to fast forward through all the singing--which NEVER stopped. (Originally written October 2011).Since my first posting of this review, I have watched this episode again. Still not crazy about it, but perhaps deserves something better than one star. Sep 30 2012."
3,Disappointing,"I have been a stop the world Grey's is on fan since the beginning, however, this season was no longer ""must see TV"" for me. Callie is not(and has never been) my favorite character and she seems to have been the featured character for many of the episodes. I really didn't care about her, her drama with Mark, Arizona and the entire baby business. I actually turned it off...really couldn't stand it.The music episode was unwatchable...turned that one off, too. What were you thinking?I agree with one of the other reviewers that they seemed to have lost touch with the original interns and they're the ones who made the show what it was.April is the annoying person at work that you just can't stand to be around and now, she's chief resident??? Really? Callie was selected over Bailey, too, and they undid that. There's still hope.I watched the finale last night and thought it was the best episode in a long time. They came back to their roots and redeemed the entire season for me."
2,Grey's Anatomy,"I still haven't received the product, another order posted after this one has arrived. What should I do to learn about this order?"
5,For those into it,So deep in the season I can only comment on the streaming - technically. It is working nicely most of the time. The occasional connection crash that are simply solved by resuming
5,gt,this is my ultimate favorite show in the whole wide world thanks so much wounderful shipping method and now i just cant wait for moe to come out thanks
4,My favorite Medical Drama,"Another good season, I recommend buying the whole series, good character development, even have some I don't like (because they want you not to like them)"
1,Organic endocrine disruptor!?,"Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year."
5,absolutely the best,"I love Muir Glen. This size of sauce is perfect for me, no waste. The sauce has the taste of fresh tomatoes and is very thick, not watery. I use tomatoes in almost every dish, love pasta. I also love the fire-roasted tomatoes by Muir Glen. Great price and they are not available in my locale."
2,Incomplete info on product.,"The information here isn't complete. It doesn't tell you what kind of charger you need. If you're like me, your old charger won't work on this. How does the battery perform?..I'll follow up in a month when I get the charger for it."
5,Endless power,"Although you will spend a chunk of money if you are doing this to replace the older type of batteries for your drill, but to me it was worth it. You have to buy a new charger also by the way! I love my 9.6 drill and did not want to buy a new one (these last for ever if you ask me) the power is much better than ever before and they last forever. I used mine to drill several 3"" holes through 3/4 inch treated plywood and was already using it before I started the project. The batteries were not freash and it did not let me down. Great product if you can shell out the money on an old drill.... that is up to you!!!"
2,9.6Volt NiMH Makita Battery,Be SURE you have a charger that will charge a NiMH battery -- many if not most standard Makita chargers will NOT!
2,Hard to follow,"For a beginner, this video is hard to follow. The demonstration is not step by step and tends to jump around. Also, the camera keeps circling around the dancer which makes it difficult to see the dancer's arm, feet, and body positions."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed. The tape really only teaches 2 hip moves. All the other hip moves she just tells you what the other girl is doing but doesn't actually explain how to do it. She just basically tells you what each move is called. I would ask for my money back if I could. It was a big let down for me...
1,suffered!,"I really liked the first three books, but this was painful to read. I hate how so many fantasy series start off strong and end up with me paying to suffer through bad storytelling."
1,The worst conclusion imaginable!,"The first 3 books of the Wayfarer Redemption where wonderful: great plot, characterization, and wonderful writing. However, the next three books in the series went from bad to worse. The series `continued' the story while changing the entire storyline; the character's where all very similar and predictable; and the writing was malicious at best. There was a lot of completely unnecessary violence, vague and unexplained concepts, and the ending was positively the worst conclusion of a tale that had began with such promise. I will NEVER be able to reread or forget the last 3 books of the Wayfarer Redemption series, and these last three books where so awful that they may have ruined the first three!!!"
2,"Crusader (The Wayfarer Redemption, Book 6)","I found this book to be of little enjoyment, I feel it strays to far from the rest of the series and leaves the reader with a dull and vague finality to the series."
2,A disappointing conclusion,"The ties that binded this mythology together begin to unravel. As I enjoyed the first three, it is a sad thing to have to say, but the characters leave much to be desired, the story is splintered, and the brutality is often unnecessarily gruesome.Loose threads remain -- who are the people of the forest? Where did the enchantress come from? And was it really necessary to tie this vision to an 'old earth' which did nothing for developing the story?"
2,"Very Very Odd, with a touch of disappointing","Well, where to start... The book starts out, okay....but then quickly becomes ridiculous. The end is well, weird, it feels like she didn't know how to end the series so said, ""I'll just send them all to heaven."" then worked for three books to give us an Adam and Eve/Atlantis type ending. Yes, seriously, that's how it ended. Enjoy if you can."
2,Where did this book come from?,"I was very dissatified with this book. When I finished it, I wanted to throw it against the wall. I think the author took ""love conquers all"" to extremes.Some of the things I was unhappy about were:How Zenith started out so strong and turned into an idiotThe Zenith/StarDrifter relationshipThe Zenith/WolfStar relationshipFaraday's determination to be a victim - I wanted to shake herThe Faraday/Isfrael relationshipIsfrael's change and what happened to himThe whole endingIt was just such a let down.I liked Faraday in the first trilogy and I always thought she had gotten the dirty end of the stick. The fact that she finally got her happy ending is the only reason I gave it two stars.Since its the last book of this trilogy, people will have to read it. Just be warned not to expect much."
5,perfect condition,i got the book in perfect condition. it was sealed and in great shape. i couldnt ask for more. it even got to me quickly.
3,Where are her editors/proofreaders??,"Yi, yi, yi! Doesn't anyone at Tor know anything about grammar? Sara Douglass is a wonderful storyteller, but she stupidly and frequently makes the offensive blunder of writing: ""between you and I"" (p. 51 of this book) or""better for you and I"" (p. 35 of this book). Someone with a PhD in history should know better; and if she doesn't, then her editors/proofreaders should. Grrrr."
2,Great series but weak ending,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Wayfarer Redemption series until I got to the middle book 6. The first trilogy is superb. It is a tightly constructed fantasy with a sophisticated plot, intriguing elements such as the Star Dance, and impressive use of foreshadowing in the form of the prophecy. The characters grow and the plot develops very smoothly in the first trilogy. By the end of book 3, Enchanter, the story is nicely wrapped up and it would have been a great place to stop.Book 4 starts 40 years later following many of the children of the original heroes and a new evil threat. I continued to enjoy books 4 and 5. But by middle of book 6 the author had written herself into a corner and was struggling with balancing the power of the characters. The demons had been made all powerful. Last few chapters of the book were a struggle to read as the rules of the game become erratic and the heroes seem to win various battles arbitrarily."
1,really bad!,"I agree with others when they say that the series started out great, but it is so obvious that Sara Douglass didn't like Faraday. I was so disgusted with the series, that I threw them out in the trash. I just couldn't believe how she ended it. There is nothing beautiful about suffering, depression, and betrayal. Don't get me wrong, I am all for the twists and the new found love in stories, but this was just wrong. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Terrible,"Probably the worst, most drawn out, book I have ever read. The ending is just plain stupid and defeats anything else she had previously represented in her earlier novels. I was left in a terrible mood after reading it because the ending was just plain horrible. It was as if the author got bored with it and tossed some random elements into the book and just finished it off. It could be comparable to a hunter killing a bunny. No one wants to see it happen and destroys something that could have been good."
2,Douglass does it yet again...,"You'd think I'd quit reading these, considering how much the author's misuse of words annoys me. Once again, the story and characters have great potential, but the whole thing falls flat because of serious language problems. Neither the author nor her editors seem to own a dictionary, because there are still a number of extremely amusing flaws in the writing.1. Douglass continues to use ""virulent"" in place of ""virile"" to describe her male characters.2. An automat is something found at a restaurant or lunch counter ca. 1950; she appears to have this device confused with ""automaton"".3. The plural of child is *not* ""childs"", but is ""children"".If nothing else, the books are good for a laugh."
2,Disappointed!,Shipping was fast but when i gave it to my girlfriend for her birthday there was a big knot it took me over an hour to get it out.
2,Quality of cd mastering leaves much to be desired.,"Mount Rushmore's music was good heavy rock perfect for it's time and when I had the records, I really enjoyed 'em. However...the cd's sound really thin and scratchy. Would never have bought had I known. The music is great but the quality sucks. Don't buy these."
4,Great Deal,this shoe runs about one size smaller (if you usually wear an 8 youll need a size 8 1/2 or 9) but it is definetly worth buying. it looks like a much more expensive shoe and you wont be dissapointed with it. only complaint is the strap in back dosent look as sturdy as it could be but still a good purchase.
5,"Excellent ""sequel"" to The Dramatists' Toolkit","This book is an excellent ""sequel"" to Jeffrey Sweet's earlier playwriting book, The Dramatists' Toolkit. Scenes written by students and lesser-known playwrights are included along with detailed (sometimes line-by-line) analysis and criticism. I found this book helpful as well as interesting. Highly recommended!"
2,Dazed and Confused,"The Sex Offender by Matthew Stadler is a reading nightmare. When you think it's coming together and starting to make sense, everything goes astray. It peaks the imagination, but ultimately leaves you, like it's hero, overexcited and unable to perform. The writing is someimes beautiful and sometimes indulgent. It would be nice to be inside Matthew Stadler's brilliant mind and travel with him on this convoluted trip."
1,Mistake in Price????,Is there a mistake in your price of this item and if it IS $10+ do you truly have this item for sale? I am interested in buying some smaller flour sack kitchen towels but not for $100. Thanks.
2,childish fight,"It is a bit strange to watch all this fight against Dan Brown's book. What is for? Millions people who like the Da Vinci Code book usually do not take it as a source of historical facts. The value of this book is not in the particular facts but in general (and serious) idea about danger of destroying male-female balance in society. Indeed, a human being consists of two parts. Males and females have very different views on this World so that these views should be well balanced. If one of the parts becomes heavily predominating, it may be truly dangerous for survival of our species. Dan Brown just takes our attention to the problem. He shows that the imbalance has a long history and it might be a major source of many current problems in human society as well as the source of overall instability on the Earth. And the latter is not fiction."
1,Extremely Biased,"This is an extremely biased DVD put together by Christians for Christians. I thought it would be some ""Discovery Channel""-type look at the historical facts surrounding the controversy, but it's not. Since viewing this, I have seen some other similar programs on The History Channel and The National Geographic Channel which are much more fair, and give both sides of the argument equal time. This one doesn't. It also has several facts wrong. If you are really interested in the history behind the controversy, buy something else. This is very one-sided and is only good for showing in a church basement during a revival meeting."
1,Only for the closed minded,"Fortunately I obtained this DVD from the library & didnt have to pay for it. Very one sided. Almost completely avoids discussing both sides. Recomnmend instead, DA Vinci Codde Decoded, Jesus, Mary & Da Vinci or Unlociking Da Vinci's Code. Check Amazon reviews & rating on these other DVDs"
2,This is for non-beleivers only!,"I was extremely disappointed with this title in the sense that it is a one way only answer. They do admit that the book is a great read but apparently everything Mr. Brown wrote is fiction based on his own delusions. They also seem to point to Mr. Brown as the only person to ever make claims like the ones in his book. I am an open-minded person and will gladly look into new ideas and possibilities. This dvd made me feel like a fool to do so. On the other hand, if you don't beleive anything in the book, then this dvd is for you. It might also help to let everyone know that at the end of the presentation, the narrator tells you that if you want to know the whole truth, you should seek your answers in a book you probably already have at home... the bible. How convenient! Hope this helps!"
2,Great Song Horrible Quality Vinyl,"Let me just say i love this song loved ""cross"", but the quality of this vinyl is just ridiculously bad...it sounds like its coming from a tin can."
3,I will treasure my copy forever,"Have you ever stared at your boring dinner and wished that every item on your plate could come in the form of a gelatinous blob? Have you ever tried in vain to find Clam'n'Cheese Jello at the grocery store? With this book, you can surprise your dinner party guests with a five-course gelatin-based meal featuring such beloved dishes as Boeuf à la mode en gelée (p. 40), Thousand Island Salmon (p. 33), or the aforementioned Clam and Cheese Salad (p. 47)!I'll admit, it would take a braver palate than mine to actually try any of these recipes, but somehow my life is just a little better because this book exists."
5,Great ! as usual,"Once again great job Naxos for a quality product ! Great sound and production !!Boccherini was a talented virtuosic most people don't know much about. He was a virtuoso cellist and took his cello compositions to a new light. I have all the Haydn Baryton Trios and works by Beethoven and Vivaldi. These works equal and exceed in most cases those works. Boccherini has a unique compositional style of a musical potentate.Boccherini is listed in the Guinness Book of Music Facts and Feats as ""the most ingratiating composer."" His sound is as aristocratic as Mozart.I use to listen to alot of Vivaldi, now I have moved on to Boccherini and Tartini.Please remember this is just my opinion. I do not seek, nor relish, hostile or vindictive animus from anyone. If two people always agree.....One of them is a liar.Great used cd price made these cello concertos an awesome aquisition !! Make sure to get Vol. 1 (#1-4) and Vol. 2 (#5-8)Good day friends !"
2,"Uninspired, Formulaic","I really like Elmore Leonard and have enjoyed and respected much of his work. But when reading this book I felt that Elmore had really mailed it in this time. The big ""surprise"" ending comes as no surprise, and the book fizzles rather than sizzles. In this book, the characters are more like cartoons than people. All in all, I was disappointed, and was glad when it was over so I could read something better.Just so you know I'm not an Elmore basher, I just finished reading ""The Hot Kid"" and loved it."
3,Kidnapped Wife Finds Herself,"Two small time hoods decide they can get away with kidnapping the wife of a wealthy businessman and scoring $1,000,000 ransom. They hook up with a rent-a-cop who collects Nazi memorabillia. While being held hostage the victim comes to the realization that her life as a wife, mother and country club goer was quite empty. She decides to go over to the hoodlums. Kind of like a Stockholm syndrome situation. A decent but not particularly gripping read."
1,"Slow, terse, and unfocused","Slow, terse, and unfocused. Elmore Leonard's 'The Switch' is one of his more convoluted works. A testament to late `70's upper-crust living and a some shady characters quick-money scheme that falls flat - much like this book.Leonard's talent for developing personalities in small doses stands shaky in `The Switch'. Leonard quickly develops Mickey Dawson, a well-to-do wife living the country club lifestyle in suburban Detroit. Her life is set on appeasing her husband, Frank, a real estate businessman with a penchant for golf and booze. When two ex-cons contrive an idea to kidnap the wife, the plot then takes a twist even the ex-cons didn't anticipate. The book's ending, which leaves you with some intentions, is uninspiring.Slow in reading and heavy in dialogue - leaning between insight and contemplation, this book is not one of Elmore Leonard's better offerings."
4,"Taranteno recomends,....","I live in Michigan. Leonard in a celeb here, but I never read any of his books, until I heard Quentin Taranteno had his cast of ""Jackie Brown"" read ""The Switch"" before they started filming.Yes, I know ""Jackie Brown"" is the Leonard novel ""Rum Punch"".So being a huge Q.T. fan I read ""The Switch"".POW!!!I have a new hero,....his name is Elmore Leonard!!!"
2,WISH I HAD SWITCHED FROM THE SWITCH!!!,"Have read several Leonard books and this may be the worst one I have read. The two so called ""bad men"" remind me of my self if I tried to do what they did. NOTHING goes right. Ordell Robbie and Louis Gara grab Mickey Dawson, wife of Frank Dawson, to hold for ransom. Frank could care less. He has a mistress and does not want his wife back. This makes Mickey very upset and she decides she wants part of the action with Ordell and Louis. Meanwhile, the mistress decides she wants to be part of their plan too. You will meet crazy Richard, who likes to shoot people. There was page after page of just talk. Nothing happening. I kept thinking it would get better but no such luck. If you are having trouble sleeping try this book."
1,Crayola presents The Ugly Duckling video- awful!,"Unlike the other Crayola presents videos we have (Brambly Hedge, Percy the Park Keeper, and The Mouse and Mole, this video is more along the lines of The American Tale. It is very scary with unnecessary dark plots intermixed with otherwise cheery songs by the two main characters. It has evil characters who constantly threaten or encarcerate the protagonists. How one can turn what could have been a nice lesson in understanding others into such a dark scary story is beyond me. It's going right into the trash! It really deserves no stars. Buy the others and enjoy! Ages 4 and up-IT'S NOT!"
4,A fun way to practice English,"I've used this book to liven up false beginers to intermediate ESL classes. The repetitve structures offer plenty of practice on grammar structures, but put them in context with a story; the students don't even realize that they are studying grammar. It's not sufficient as the sole text in a course, but is an excellent companion to any English textbook."
4,I really wish DDD existed back then,A good album but the transfer is terrible. It sounds like this CD was recorded with a mono microphone held at the speaker of an old phonograph. The amount of noise is so great that sometimes it is really hard to hear the soft parts over it.
2,doesn't work,"this product doesn't clean very well. the glass cleaner is good, the bathroom cleaner is ok. i have yet to try the other products. it may prevent scum buildup, but it doesn't remove it very well. i really hate strong odors and this one has one too. it may not be the same as inhaling clorine products, but it's still annoying. the only reason i'm giving it 2 stars is cause it doesn't burn eyes, skin, or throats the way other products do."
4,nice nd snug,This is a good sturdy binder.However it does not make you sweat like some other brands- I also like it because it will not tear up on you.I did notice that the price went up on it since i have bought mine.
5,Super!,"I have bought cheap blades at drugstores, they don't work well. This one is truly quality, easy to install and it works better than any wiper blade I have ever purchased. The price is low for such a great product."
1,"""fast and easy installation"" ...yeah, right!","I give this product one star because the box promises ""fast and easy installation"" yet it utterly fails to instuct me in how to put these on the car! (It's not intuitive and I'm no idiot, thank you very much)The installation instructions provided on the cardboard backing consist of a series of tiny drawings of a pair of hands holding various hard-to-identify objects performing various undescribed tasks that all look the same! What is the weird tool for? How does it work? What is happening in the pictures? What's the objective? Absurd!"
5,great cd for those just getting aquainted with opera,"a great ""entry level"" work for those unfamiliar with opera but wishing to experience the music. It is at the same time easy to listen to and exciting."
2,He is DEFINATELY NOT Del Monaco or Corelli,"For all of the people out there reading the reviews on here make sure you take them with a grain of salt. Most peoples ear for voice is terrible. If you had heard Del Monaco or Corelli live you would know what complete and utter bullcrap these reviews are. Although Ben Heppner's voice may be considered large by todays standards it is small compared to Corelli and ESPECIALLY Del Monaco. In this age of state of the art recording equipment everyone sounds like they have a big voice. Mr. Heppner also lacks the core and squillo that Del Monaco and Corelli (and countless others) had. The ring in their voices is where all of the harmonics happen. It is these kinds of comparisons that have allowed the opera to decline to the level that it is today. Intstead of saying, ""Why are'nt people singing like DelMonaco and Tebaldi and Nilsson anymore?"" we have people trying to bring lesser voices up to their level. Very sad."
4,Great little book - recipes may need tweaking,"I got this for my mom and she is enjoying it. She reads Thai and a little English so this was perfect. However, with use, we've discovered some recipes definitely needed tweaking. This could be due to the different kitchen and qualify of ingredients I guess. Still, a very good reference for some hard to find Thai dishes."
3,Bug Book,"This book is large and includes every bug in North America (even teeny-tiny ones) but I was a little disappointed in it. Perhaps because I had different expectations than what the book for compiled for. For an example...galls on plants. The book lists all the bugs that cause galls, and have many, many pictures of different gall types and styles, but with hardly any details. Some bugs are good, bad, or ""just are"" but very little was written about any of them. Although the pictures were numerous and nice clear shots...many of them didn't show a good example of the actions that a particular insect causes, or treatment plans for the damaging ones."
4,The Flower Gardeners Bible,"This was very interesting and covered lots of flowers, which is what I was looking for. Nice pictures, lots of good information for the flower gardener."
4,Ray Cook Putters,"As in the past, the M1-3G heel shaft putter is a fine example of engineering at its best. Beautifully balanced,a double bend shaft can also be provided by Ray Cook. The blue and white coloured head is unusual but does not detract from its principal object of getting the ball into the hole.I just wish it could be purchased in the UK as the shipping charges, as well as HM Customs and Excise dues, are extortionate. Regretfully, the extra costs very probably prevent the UK customer from buying this magnificent putter."
5,COUNT IT ALL JOY!!!!!,"SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!! Mrs. Adams has got to be sitting at the feet of Jesus to get such inspirational stories out of her soul. THANK YOU FOR SHARING what GOD has imparted into you!!! It's my prayer that you will get the INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM that you so deserve! You are doing KINGDOM work, girl!! I am so proud of you. Can't wait to read Watercolored Pearls!"
5,NOTHING BUT THE RIGHT THING:A NOVEL,"When I first read this book I did not know this book was a follow up to SPEAK TO MY HEART.I thought from the first word that this book was good!It takes a lot of heart to do what Erika had to do as far as her having to leave her husband,Also to for SERENA to take in her friends baby especially since she had a hard time having a baby of her own.GOOD BOOK!"
5,perfect,I received my book in a very timely manner and in excellent condition. I really enjoyed this book.
5,Loved this book.,How did this jewel of a book get lost in between the success of Wasted and Madness???? It's brilliant!!!
5,A great essay on the mislabeling of genocide.,"It is always interesting to hear someone who is not an Ottoman expert or one who hasn't studied the material to label the massacres of Armenians, which were all isolated incidents resulting from Armenian-Christian tensions, as an ""Armenian Genocide"". For an event or massacre to be genocide, there must be some sort of intent by the government or an ethnic group to exterminate the other group. There was no such hate or intent documented by anyone. In fact, the Ottoman government tried it's best to encourage the ceasing of massacres and even relocated the Armenians away from the massacres and violence since the Ottoman government could not differentiate between the honest, hard-working Armenian, and the secretive Armenian rebel, collecting arms, and damaging Ottoman communication lines and supply routes.Buy this essay and give it a read, hearing both sides to a story riddled with propaganda is the democratic way."
3,Static,"This headset works nicely when it works. But, it sometimes connects poorly and has static. It has to be disconnected and reconnected to function properly. It has to be re-paired sometimes also. I do like the long battery life but I will definitely go for a different headset when this one dies. I like the wire free convenience."
3,Okay,"I was able to hear everyone fine. However, most of the people I spoke with heard more background distortion despite the quietness I heard. Therefore, I ended up taking it off most of the time and it didn't really serve the purpose of me driving with a hands free headset."
4,Motorola Bluetooth Headset H700 Fire Red,"I have never used a Bluetooth headset so this is my first experience with this gadget. I absolutely love the color, because it matches my Razr. It's small and light so you don't feel like you're being weighed down. The communication is clear. I'm not a big talker but I needed a hands-free method of speaking on the cell while driving and felt that wireless was the way to go. The only downfall I find is that it is another gadget you have to charge. The charge on this headset does not appear to last as long as I thought it would. If you don't mind having to charge another gadget, I highly recommend it."
4,Love my H700.,"Had a bluetooth that came with my phone (I think the H530?) and it drove me crazy...didn't fit good, poor sound quality, difficulty making calls. The H700 fits alot better...stays put around my ear much better. Nice and small. Great sound quality. Using the voice tag feature is still a little annoying, but it may be me or my phone (it sometimes has difficulty recognizing the tag and it occasionally connects but neither party can hear the other). Overall, I'm pretty pleased."
3,Motorola H700,"When I first got it, it worked really well. But recently everytime I use it, people I am talking to can hardly hear me and complain that it is constantly breaking up."
4,H700 Headsets,"Descent headset for the Amazon price. My wife and I have a Motorola RAZR V3m along with two H700 headsets. The headsets have pretty good volume control. Sometimes people we call have trouble hearing us saying it sounds like we are in a tunnel. There is an intermitant ""static"" like crackling at vary rates everytime we use the headset. Most times it isn't distracting, but it is there. Other wise a good headset for $60."
4,I like it!,"I read other reviews of this before I bought it. Sounds like no Bluetooth headsets are really perfect but this one was rated pretty good and it matches my Motorola KRZR Fire. It does echo a little from time to time, but otherwise seems to work well. It is a handy little item to have as well because I can never hear my phone's ring tone, even at full volume, when it is in my purse and I am driving. If I have the headset on I don't miss a call. So I am happy with it."
3,"Nice, but not the best","Bought this when my first Motorola bluetooth headset died. Read lots of reviews, and thought that this would fill the bill nicely. Audio is great, I can here very well with it. Talking is worse than my older headset - people frequently tell me I sound distant, ""like you're in a tunnel"". I've been using it for several months, and I'm looking for a replacement. Not terrible, but adequate at best."
3,Typical H700,"This is just a nice color on the typical H700 headset. it picks up a lot of background noise, especially while I'm driving. The red color gets noticed by everyone, and my wife doesn't accidentally leave with my headset anymore (she has the blue one) Other than that it is identical to every other H700 out there.it would have been great if they flipped the lights so ""red"" was working normal and ""blue"" was needs a charge, but I guess it would have been too much to ask."
3,can you hear me now?,that's what's I have to keep asking everyone when I use this headset. I'm not impressed.
3,Decent for the Price,"The Good: This headset is light and fairly comfortable to wear. Speaker performance is acceptable. Battery life is impressive. It's also really cute.The Bad: Microphone quality is not great. People I call can always tell when I'm using the headset, unlike better (but considerably more expensive) headsets like the Jawbone."
2,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset,"I have tried several and found the H700 to be my best pick. I like the collapasable boom which serves two function. First, it is a very positive way to turn it on and off. Other devices require that you depress a button for a specifed period of time and wait for the tone. This fucntion was a little unreliable on some of the units I tired. Secondly, it make for a smaller package for easier storing. The over the ear attachment was comfortable and secure. With devices that plug into your ear, I could never get a good fit or feeling like it would fall out and I would loose it. Sound quality and connection speed is excellent when used with my Samsung A900M."
2,Ok Bluetooth,"This bluetooth doesn't is the same as the first one that i had, but it doesn't work as good it keep disconnecting from my phone."
3,Not very sturdy,I really like the color and the product but the durability was poor. the ear part broke off in less than a year.
2,Motorola Bluetooth H700,"Not a ""Happy Camper"" with this product. It doesn'r hold a charge. Talk time is maybe 30 minutes. Took it to a battery store and found there's no way to replace the battery. The case is a sealed case. Would not buy another one."
5,Great Price,"Super Great Price,and came really fast I ruined my other bluetooth so I needed a new one buying this one I paid more then half the price then my original one, Thank God for online buying. Thank You Very Much."
3,"Pleasant, but not essential, effort by a 1990's line-up","This 1992 CD features original member John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson along with a couple other guitarists and various backing musicians. This is a very different group than the legendary 1970's version. However, take it for what it is, and it's a pleasant listen. Essentially, the group reworks a few classics, and plays a few standards and originals. However, the remakes do not measure up to the originals, in this fan's opinion. (The change of lyrics in ""Lonesome LA Cowboy"" doesn't work for me, for example). Still, ""Midnight Moonlight"" is a great song, no matter who's playing it, and the bagpipes on ""Sutter's Mill"" are neat. The musicianship is also top notch. This is not a disappointing CD, unless you are expecting the original group. Enjoy it if you are a fan of the NRPS. But if you are not familiar with this group, try one of their early albums first."
5,Amazing and Heart-warming,"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it for the first time when I was about 16 and I am now 23 and have recommended it to several people who truly love animals like I do. This book made me realize I wasn't alone in the hard life of caring so deeply for animals that it affects your life on this level. I could relate to so many of her feelings...I recommend this to anyone, it is a must read!"
1,Another one of her compilations of stories,"Disjointed, hyperbolic, pedestrian. Is this the kind of book the reviewers rave about-- it's so transparent."
3,Uninspired rendition of a masterwork,"For the most part, this recording of the famed Berlioz Requiem is very good. In some places, I feel as though Maestro Ozawa is pushing the tempo, making this great piece lose some of its strength. One place in particular is in the Tuba Mirum movement. The tempo is simply too fast, and the timpani chorus does not come through very well on this recording. What is usually the high point of the Requiem is not in this recording. I do love the interpretation of the Sanctus movement, the tenor soloist and chorus do a splendid job of interpreting this gorgeous part of the music."
2,needs a different tenor,"This is an excellent recording of the orchestral and choral parts of Berlioz' great Requiem. The brass especially comes through nicely for the most part. Unfortunately, I find the solo tenor almost painful to listen to. He has a voice like an angel, and in many ways this is, of course, particularly well suited to the subject matter. However, he is one of those singers who slides from one note to another--if he's moving up a fourth, for example, I guarantee you are going to hear every note in between. If this doesn't bother you, then fine, but I for one am going to look for a different recording of this."
2,Warning to casual listeners: Mostly unlistenable,"While the other reviews praise the quality of the performances, it is unmentioned how badly the dynamic range of the recording ruins the product. If you listen to it on headphones or in a dedicated room (I don't) it may be ok, but if there is ANY background noise at all, you will hear minutes of silence punctuated by blasts of trumpets and chorus, the Hosannah and little else. Gain equalization software helps, but the levels are too dissimilar for that to be of much use. What needs to happen for this cd is a remix, bringing up the quiet parts and down the trumpets."
1,Tired old rehash in a shiny cover,I own a 65 MKII Spitfire and was hoping this book would be usefull in my restoration efforts. I was very dissapointed with it. It is too generic in its information because they are trying to cover 4 different cars through the decades of models in 300 pages.all the pictures are black and white and show little detail. Haynes was once a good source of info but this book offers nothing that can't be found in better detail for free on the web.
2,Not Great,I was hoping that this would help fix an old Spitfire. Not a lot of detail. Not clear photos or writing.
2,Dark Pictures,"As a picture book on in-depth repairs, the darkly printed photographs are difficult to make out. Lots of good information, just can't get as much out of the pictures as hoped."
3,triumph restoration,I personally find the layout of picture captions and descriptions a little confusing. Overall this is a good comple over view but not as detailed or helpful as I thought it would be. Also the picture quality/sharpness could have been better.
4,Take a picture before you open.,The only improvement I would suggest is to print the names of the butterfly on the back. We took a picutre of them before removing them so we would know which they were later.
4,Best feeder on the market,"We bought one of these feeders a few years ago and liked it so well we bought another. They stand up to the weather well and hold lots of feed. In our country setting most feeders are emptied within a day except for these. They also come apart for easy cleaning and the large opening makes filling them easy, too. Highly recommend this for anyone with more than just an occassional visit from feathered friends."
1,CellStik,This product apparently does not work for certain phone service companies such as Cricket. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THIS IS A CONCERN AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE. This was a complete waste of money for me and I would like a refund. If it is not going to work for all V265 Motorola phones there should be a way of knowing this in advance of purchase.
4,NO LIMIT 1989 - 2005,THIS IS THE BEST screwed and chopped cd i have heardthe original cd is good as wellNO LIMIT -WHERE THEY AT -they on topYA HEARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
4,"A Reading Of ""(Florida Revisited)?""","Length:: 3:07 MinsThese previously unpublished poems and essays (exhausively footnoted) indeed do not display the fine craftsmanship of Bishop at her best. But they do reveal the extraordinarily chaotic life of a poet beset by all manner of dire events: bouts of alcoholism, suicides of lovers, relatives dying in madhouses etc. that make it a very gripping read.I chose this particular poem to read because it best represents these elements in Bishop's life. Her approach to it and herself was extremely sardonic. Indeed, having read all the poems included herein aloud, I find it impossible to get the tone correct without adopting a sardonic, self-mocking manner. It's simply the only plausible way to read these poems.This is not the best Bishop poem, but it's the most representative of this volume. It reveals the dark side of herself which she hid from the world and did not want us to see."
3,More interesting than early reviews indicated,"Now that this is remaindered, it's safe to pick up a copy. No, it is not a perfect EB collection, but it doesn't claim to be. Any time one delves into the unpublished material of a writer, one knows one is not going to find gold--it's not here. But it sure is interesting stuff. I do wish someone had transcribed rather than reproduced the series of drafts of ""One Art."" There's real insight into EB's process."
3,"Decent, but could be better","Nice size, nice smooth texture, flexible yet firm, not a bad toy. There are a couple things I would change, though: 1) do something about the smell! I thought maybe the smell would go away, or at least fade a bit after a couple of washes, but it didn't. You might want to use a condom, or take a shower after using, or else smell like rubber. 2) the suction could be a little better. It's ok. but only if you're going pretty slow and easy. If you're getting a little crazy, it tends to pop off just when you get a good rhythm going!"
3,so so,not as good as the rest of the series. unfortunately I had slightly higher hopes for this product. hopefully I'll have better luck next time.
1,"According to JWs, Jesus is not God.","The book has some excellent art work and is well organized. That's why I gave it a one star. The biased, out of context teachings herein do not teach the Jesus of the Bible. Witnesses do believe in Jesus, but as a perfect man and not God. That puts them squarely in the middle of heresy, that of Arianism and Gnosticism. So, they do not believe in the Jesus of scripture but have set up their own version of Jesus. Muslims, non-messianic Jews and others do the same thing: They dispute Jesus own words and the witness of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.In John 1:1, they translate thus, ""Jesus is a god"", which is polytheistic. This is only one of 300+ places in their 'bible' that obscures or eliminates the proofs of Jesus' divine nature. Don't believe me? Check out the book ""Reasoning from the Scriptures with Jehovah's Witnesses"" by David Reed."
5,Seriously Funny,I was channel surfing one night and came across this show. First off ALL of these ladies are funny. Especially Monique Marvez (She was my personal favorite) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD I love the way they bring alot of female issues that we men sort of take for granted and make them funny. I honestly watched this after a argument with my lady and after watching it together we forgot what we were fighting about. So I guess it's true comedy cures.
4,"Very entertaining, you'll share this one with your friends.","This DVD features four of the funniest Latinas I have seen in a long time, including a very special performance by the late Marilyn Martinez who I had the pleasure of seeing several times in person. This DVD makes a great addition to the collection of any serious or casual fan of comedy, don't miss it!"
4,The lion roars,"Good beginning to this series. A little harsh, but very entertaining. I read other books in this series prior to this one and it fits quite well."
3,Other Books,"Another novel in Wilbur Smith's Courtneys of Africa series of stories. Here he tells the tale of two Courtney brothers, Sean and Garrick. They are non identical twins, and one day, decide to play with firearms. Garrick becomes a poster child for why adults should keep their guns away from children.He is shot, and has to have his leg removed as a consequence. This colors the brothers relationship, even with their women, for a long time, and through various African historical events."
3,"Great story, but many typos in the Kindle version","I read this book many years ago, and having (mistakenly) disposed of the paper version in a house move, have now downloaded the Kindle version for my wife to read. She enjoyed it as much as I had, and I am now re-reading it myself. Its surprising how much you forget of the plot over the years! I have enjoyed it again, but that enjoyment has been marred by a large number of typos, or scanning errors in the text. Where there should be quotation marks, or punctuation marks, there is a spurious letter on the beginning or end of the word. Often the word is just wrongly transcribed, necessitating a stop to decode what it should be, and that destroys the flow of the text as you read. Very disappointed in the quality of the Kindle transcription, especially as it was nearly as expensive as buying another new paperback! Get the transcription right, or reduce the cost! Maybe both?"
3,When The Lion Feeds,"I love all of Smiths work, but considered this book not quite up to the standards of his other works. Will this prohibit me from reading the next installment of this series? Absolutely not! Wilber Smith is my favorite adventure writer of all time."
4,When the Lion Feeds,Wilbur Smith writes good stories. Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Immediately purchased (on my Kindle) the next novel in the trilogy; The Sound of Thunder.
2,Disappointing,"I read the previous books about the Courtneys. Excellent reads. I was disappointed with this extension of the Courtney Saga from Wilbur Smith's previous work. Good story until Sean Courtney meets his wife to be, Katrina. Read like TV a soap opera sounds after that. The end of the story was not credible. Not exactly a waste of time to read. But almost. I hope the next one measures up to the ones that preceded ""When the Lion Feeds."""
4,Sorry Wilbur,I do like Wilbur Smith books but this does not keep me reading as much as the Egypt series did. Hopefully the more Courtney's I read the better it will get.
5,A Lion of a Man,"Twins more different than fire and ice. Sean & Garrick Courtney were raised in South Africa's cattle country during the late 1800s. Accidently Sean maimed his twin brother while out hunting when they were still kids. Then, something that can destory even the best of men come between them, a woman. So Sean leaves home to make his fortune in the 1890s gold rush. But when he has the fortune he deals with the problem of every rich person. How do you keep everyone eles from taking what is yours?? A great book in all aspects"
3,Does the job but overpriced,"It is basically a 36mm socket for more than $20. They did not let me know what size drive it had. It was 3/8"" and my torque wrench is 1/2"". Now I need an adapter so it will be a socket for more than $30"
4,Nice earphone for voice,This is a wonderful earphone for a pop fans which only cost no more than $120. The only one bad is earmuffs can't make it tightly in your ears.
3,Nothing New Here,"This is more an EP than an actual album since it's so short, and there's nothing new here at all. These songs have been featured elsewhere. I'd save my money unless you really don't have any other Celine Dion music."
2,MY LEAST FAVORITE RELEASE,"Amon Amarth is without a doubt a talented and unique extreme metal band,but this cd can not be compared to the brillant VS. THE WORLD or OSFTGH. The songs on this release sound rather repetitive and suffer from a more straight forward death metal sound,rather than the killer viking style in .VS THE WORLD. I would suggest picking up AMON AMARTH .VS THE WORLD(WHICH IS 2CD WITH UNRELEASED SONGS AND SONGS FROM THE RARE FIRST CD)AND AMON AMARTH OSFTGH rather then THE AVENGER anyday."
2,How did these guys ever get a record contract?,"My friend told me to get this CD because I was into bands like Samael and Substance D. So I bought it and it was terrible. Someone should teach the frontman to sing, not growl. Coming up with lyrics is pretty much pointless, all he has to do is make noises in the mic and hey, you have what the lyrics sound like. But I do have to give the band credit for the music. The music is really good, but the godaweful lyrics take away from the song."
3,Solid,"The cool thing about Amon Amarth is that they can continue the same sound without sounding old or like they are regurgitating a previous album. This album follows up ""Once Sent From the Golden Hall"" and delivers a platter of metal that leaves you wanting more. The production here is a bit raw, at least compared to more modern recordings. Though probably not necessary, I would like for it to get remastered like its predecessor."
2,Was this a rehearsal?,"A dissenting view from a long-time Shostakovich fan who finally tossed out his copy of this CD after several tries. Among the many so-so available versions of this work this is the only one that consistently makes me cringe. Yes Mr. Temirkanov has a good reputation, but if you listen closely, the brass--very important in this work--is out of tune! How can a good conductor let this pass, I dont know; perhaps budget and time considerations. Otherwise, the playing is, for the most part, of fair quality and non descript; certainly nothing to write home about. I simply refuse to be impressed by the fact that this is a Russian performance of a Russian work. If that is such a big factor, why even bother listening to it? The actual performance is the main thing. In short: Good recording quality, subpar performance. The greatest Russian composer of the XXth Century deserves better than this."
3,Didn't stop Vibram Five Fingers of Funk,"I purchased this item to help combat my Vibram Five Fingers' awful stench. It worked for a little while, but after about two weeks, the smell was incontestable. I recommend using a stick-deodorant on your feet."
4,Good Research Tool,Good for getting facts and tone for my genealogy scrapbook project. It is like a history book not a novel.
1,Cheap monitors.,"I have 2 of these at work. They were bought through Newegg back in March, and I use them for about 9 hours a day. While locking my computer today I noticed burned images on each screen, one has the iTunes bar on it and another has one of the programs I use. This review is based on 2 of the same monitor.PROS -~ Inexpensive (but cheap!)CONS -~ Low native resolution 1280x1024~ In less than 3 months there are already very noticeable burned images.~ One of the monitors had a dead pixel upon arrival.Stay away from these, especially if you do a lot of graphic work."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"This is the book commonly used by trainers for Lotus Smartsuite 97. It has mainly helpful topics on the main products of SS97. Where it falls short is on its teaching concepts (like Microsoft Press use of step-by-step approachs). Furthermore, it seems like the author used the older version of SS97 to write the book. Mainly, the book is poorly proofread (examples/formulas/concepts). They also fail to show you that Screencam is an included product of SS97 on the front cover!!! I feel like Sandra Eddy or another author should rewrite the book and make it more focused on SS97 applications (by thoroughly testing out examples and formulas with the updated Lotus 1-2-3 97 and included patches). Sybex needs to make a second edition of the book and do a serious rewrite. Otherwise, it provides decent help and is comparable to Lotus SS97 for Dummies (but not as fun reading!)."
1,Under-whelmed,"Production quality was poor. It shows the form in essentially two sections. Although I admittedly know nothing of this particular style or of the demonstrator, I have been a practitioner of Nanquan for about 30 years. I am less than impressed with the demonstration including his posture (note the obvious head tilting throughout the form) and his footwork. Didn't seem to work together as an integrated whole. Aside from that, this is supposed to be an instructional DVD. Although I have no intention of trying to learn from it, this is not formatted to help someone achieve that goal. There is only demonstration of the form without a breakdown and explanation. There are absolutely NO applications shown for any of the movements, which would further clarify the intent of the movements in the form. I only wish I could have seen this demo before purchasing the DVD."
1,You are fake,"No else to be said. Sir you are one big fake, tempting to use the Chi Sim name will get you no where."
5,As Informative As It Is Useful,"The Healing Cuisine of China by Zhuo Zhao and George Ellis is an excellent book! It is not a typical health food book. The book not only teaches you how to prepare healthy food; it teaches you how to prepare healthy food that tastes good! Also, there are many tidbits about Chinese culture and medicine in this book. So, you learn as you cook! Truly, this book has something for everyone, whether you are a fitness fanatic or simply one who likes good food."
4,Rough but good,"This is a book that some people will hate and rip apart. It is full of typos and other errors that indicate a ""low budget production"".However, I loved it. It is blunt and in your face and I can see why perhaps some people may not like the honesty they are confronted with. The book certainly made me think.I agreed with a lot of the theories as I could relate to some of the scenarios they presented. I didn't agree with some of the theories about parenting. I found the advertising and sales pitches funny at first, yet after a while somewhat annoying.All in all this book is full of great ideas and really good comedy. I have given four stars as I find the content and ideas more important than the form."
1,how old is the author??,"Here we go again. I'm getting bored of ""authors"" who talk like teenagers. Others described this book as controversial(the-old-how-do-you-know-it's-offensive-trick),offensive, and ""politically incorrect"" (which usually means women are the target).Shock value blah blah blah. This kind of writing is actually quite mainstream-ever watch t.v.? Most of the points the ""author"" makes will be obvious insights for the average reader who has spent any amount of time thinking of others. Perhaps the best guides for how to behave around men/women comes from the accounts of happilly married couples anyway. Ya think?"
3,Why so dry?,"One would think that it would be easy to make the biography of such an amazing person interesting. As a pleasure read this book is difficult because it is very dry. However, if you are doing research, I would recommend this book because it is full of details."
4,A classic collection of rock and country standards,"A must have item for rock and country affecionados Frank has played with the best known artists in both genres. His Jesus loves this mandoline player track,of which he has done over 100 versions,showcases Frank's speed and accuracy and truely show off his skills as one of the greatest mandolin players of our day. New Riders of the Purple Sage fans will enjoy Frank's version of Ashes of Love and Panama Red. He covers just about all the bases and has some of country's best musicians playing along with him. The Good Old Boys never sounded better."
4,A Delightful Disc,"And now for something completely different. No, not a naked organist, but a refreshing set of contemporary concertos for the recorder played by the foremost international exponent of that instrument, Michala Petri. I approached this CD with some hesitation, thinking that I would soon burn out on the sound of the recorder, but the musicianship of Michala Petri and the excellent variety of the compositions, all of them accessible but all of them interesting, soon won me over. This is a delightful disk that works well both for casual and serious listening, meaning that it should appeal to a wide spectrum of listeners."
3,joke gift,"I bought this as a bday present for my boss, it was kinda a joke, she loved it though. It was in good condition and i have no complaints.thanks"
1,"Should be titled: Heaven Talks Back, A COMMON Conversation","This book was very disappointing. Nothing was uncommon about these conversations! I've heard all of this before - it's full of common cliches. Because it had cover comments from Billy Crystal and Jay Leno, the book enticed me. I did read every page, searching for something that would make me laugh. It was then I realized that since I'm not a fan of Crystal or Leno either, I shouldn't have read this book. So, if your'e like me and you are more intrigued by offbeat humor, this book is not for you. If you like uncreative 'safe' humor, you'll like this book - maybe. (But wait until it comes out in paperback.)"
1,Not recommended for the average person,"What a book! Unless you like tasteless humor, I wouldn't recommend this book. Some of it is really offensive and I don't think it's just me. Several of my friends weren't happy with this book."
1,"Watch out!! If this is the new humor, we're in trouble!","When I buy something, I like to get my money's worth. I turned every page looking for something clever. How's this for clever? ""MARCH 18 - Love thy neighbor. And hope her husband doesn't come home early."" Am I crazy??? Is that really funny? Is it clever? It's definitely not clever (it's one of the oldest jokes around) and not funny. It's just page after page of this nonsense. Another one ""JANUARY 11 - God asks only that you include yourself among those you love because self-love is the key to happiness. But too much self-love can make you go blind."" Is this funny? The joke was on me, I picked out a book because Leno wrote the introduction and I thought, hey, maybe there is something here.... Now I know it's all connections and who you know. Buyer beware!"
5,"Great read, extremely funny and entertaining.","A little healing salve for the soul from the ""Big Guy"" himself. This is definately something to read that will left your spirits and help you refocus on the important things. Great job!"
2,"...just can't bring myself to give God only 1 star, so here","This book seems to poke fun at all the ""feel good"" books that are out now and I don't think they deserve it. I want to feel happy when I read omething, not take yet another peek into the world of redundant Hollywood jokes about Jewish women, viagra and breasts. At least this book is short, so if you spend an hour reading it, that's ALL you've lost. I got this book for a gift for someone, and I still can't decide whether to give it to them or not."
2,boring,"I don't think you could find a book that is more boring which is especially annoying when you think you're buying a ""humor"" book. A humor book is fun to have because they help you ""escape"". This book made me feel like a prisoner - I felt complelled to sit and read and find SOMETHING, ANYTHING that would make me laugh. I gave it two stars because the joke was on me, God got me good. He got me to stare and stare at this book and then buy it. I'm losing my faith!"
3,quit smart quit smoking with hypnosis,"the content of the cd was very good, but the length was too short. It should have been longer so that you get deeper into a hypnotic state. time will tell is it has helped me or not."
2,"Cheap, will not last.","This is a very cheap pump. I have been putting beer through mine. The spout is crome on the outside, but not on the inside. It has corroded badly on the inside and leaving a really bad after taste. I am not sure how to clean.The system also will not drain out unless you flip upside down...if you installed in a motor home, you will need to take off and fully flush for winter...whole pump system is plastic and will bust apart for sure."
3,Works as advertised albeit leaky,"While I'm not using this to pump water, I find that while it works as advertised there is a serious leak between the handle and the base. This happens mostly when left in the primed position, but even when not in prime position it has a slow leak at the same location. I don't know if this is a defect, or a feature. Guess that you get what you pay for (sigh)."
1,Poor product,"I purchased two of these pumps to replace a unit that had failed on my camping trailer. Neither of the two products worked. One pump failed to pump water at all, and the second leaks badly around the handle where it enters the pump body."
3,Worked as expected,My original unit (same model) was 30+ years old and stopped pumping. Bought replacement at RV store. It leaked from handle. Went back and the other unit (same as one purchased) also leaked at handle. Took a chance and ordered from Amazon. This one was OK and did not leak.
2,3 leakers out of 5,Hate to say it but I gave up on these. 3 of the last 5 I've either purchased or received as replacements have leaked at the handle seal. Valterra was great at sending replacements but how can such a simple product have such a failure rate? I'm referring to out-of-the-box failure.
3,jewelry is smaller than it looks in a picture!,It would be great if sellers would put a ruler in the picture with their products so buyers can have a better mental picture of the items actual size.
3,thin gold chain,I didn't realize how thin it was. I just hope it doest break. this is not one I would recommend for charms
5,Delicate beauty,"Beautiful chain. Delicate, but strong. Clasp is not as tiny as the chain, so it is easy to open. I wear it with a simple gold cross pendant."
5,Gold Box Chains,"I love the quality of the chains, and they were shipped in a timely manner. I would recommend this seller."
5,So glad I checked Amazon.ca for this item!,"I've been trying to get my hands on a copy of Pinch Me sung by Wee Bonnie Baker for months now! Finally I have it, and so much more. This hard to find CD is a wonderful collection and I'm so glad to have it.Prices on Amazon in 12/2009 were running about $75...YIPES! I found mine on Amazon.CA for USD $31 delivered."
5,Spectacular Blade!!,"Wow, what a knife. I'm an avid outdoorsman & collector, and I love this blade, it was love at first sight. Razor sharp out of the box, it has a beautifully symmetrical, brutal black blade with substantial heft to it, yet it feels well balanced and light in the hand. Very responsive. The stacked washer/epoxy handle was bigger than I expected, and the finger grooves felt awkward at first. However, after an evening of handling it feels like a second skin. I did some light chopping and cutting and was impressed by the results. Effortless. Razor sharp again with a few strokes through a Smith's sharpener. Pure quality, I highly recommend!!"
1,Very Disappointing,"Compare Raitt's ""Soliquoy"" on the Decca ""Selections"" CD to Hayden's on the London cast recording. Raitt's operatic majesty, masculinity laced with self-hatred, and charismatic musicality jump out of my tinny little CD player. Michael Hayden is - and I hate to criticize any performer - downright anemic by contrast, as well as lacking utterly the pathos and complexity of Raitt's showstopping version. The use of a real opera voice, with Raitt, was a stroke of genius, as it contrasts so deliciously and painfully with Billy Bigelow's shortcomings of character.I cannot overstate this- DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS LONDON VERSION. Suffice it to say, it misses ""the point"" of the show.I will continue to explore other versions, as my love of and fascination with this show is endless.GET THE DECCA VERSION - ""SELECTIONS FROM THE THEATRE GUILD MUSICAL PLAY,"", instead. Whatever its deficiences (truncation mainly) its emotional and aesthetic rewards are enormous and triumphant."
1,"Nice orchestra. Shame about the cast, though...","In my opinion, Carousel is the best R&H play written (I usually find their work to be overly fluffy). As such, I really did not like this recording. Katrina Murphy was great, the orchestra was great, and Meg Johnson was decent, but how in the world did Joanna Riding and Michael Hayden ever make it into a musical? Neither of them could sing to save their lives, and I've heard high schoolers perform ""If I Loved You"" better than that. Barbara Cook sounded like a better Julie on her recording, and she was 60 and I hate Barbara Cook!! In short, avoid this recording like the plague, get the original cast or the Broadway revival and lets just forget this little musical disaster ever happened."
5,In search of Sweetie-Peetie,"This is a wonderful little Whitman book published in 1978. It features a very good story by Jean Lewis alongside beautiful color illustrations by Werner Willis. The story takes place a few years after the events of the original Benji feature film, as Paul and Cindy Chapman are now teenagers; Benji and Tiffany haven't changed a bit, though. Now everyone knows that Benji has always enjoyed chasing Mrs. Finster's cat, and everyone pretty much knows how much Sweetie-Peetie actually enjoys being chased. Now Sweetie-Peetie has disappeared, however, and Mrs. Finster is blaming Benji for scaring her away. With his sterling reputation on the line, Benji must assume the role of detective and find his feline friend.Whitman books were a delightful part of my childhood in the 1970s, never failing to put out children's books of high quality. The story and illustrations here are excellent, bringing Benji and Tiffany to colorful life yet again to delight children of all ages."
2,"So, so","The toy is cute, but the website is not adult friendly, let alone child friendly...needs way more work!! Not very much to do on the site, and very slow loading...webkinz is way better."
1,Website never works!!,"The stuffed animal is cute, but the Shining Stars website never works. This gift was given to my child over a month ago, and we have not been able to access the website. I can't find any contact information for the company to find out the situation. Don't waste your money!"
1,STOP!! DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!,"Their Website is junk and does not work with any kind of consistency. I have several computers and we tried all of them and were only able to get on one time, and now can't get back on. I've tried contacting their online support through their email system to no avail.My son used his allowance money to buy two of these Shining Stars things. He loves Webkins and thought they would be similar. He is bitterly disappointed and I'm very annoyed.Do yourself a favor, buy Webkins and avoid this junk like the plague. - And tell all your friends!"
1,Do not buy this product,The toy itself is fine but the website is worthless. We were unable to get to the main page. The help desk told us to access the site without using our internet provider. Apparently some people are accessing the website via magic. Anyway - we are taking this toy back and getting a Webkinz instead.
4,9 yr. old likes it,"We gave this to our 9 yr old son for Christmas, and he really likes it. He loves the toy, and that's good enough for him. He hasn't gotten on the website yet, but I know he'll like that, too... he's into that kind of stuff."
4,Gift for Grandson,The penguin Wii toy is adorable. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my grandson who is wild about penguins. The nice thing about finding it on Amazon was that no stores in the area carried it. It was shipped quickly and arrived in great shape.
4,Poor John!,"Thank goodness John Matteson has alerted us to the evil agenda of Captain & Tennille! Pity it's 30 years after the fact. Nevertheless, I will now be on guard against any further acts of dastardly subversion by this most notorious of acts.Seriously, though, anyone getting angry about this most innocuous of acts - it's akin to being furious with ABBA, or even Tony Orlando & Dawn! - has a problem understanding the function of commercial pop music. I have happy memories of Song of Joy from my childhood, and although my taste in music is now considerably more sophisticated C&T; can still bring a smile to my face: that was their job, and this album still works."
4,"Great show, very funny!","I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Yeah, I know, it's silly, but it's funny and the kids love it! Nickelodeon has another hit on their hands, and it gives the kids something else to watch besides Spongebob. Don't get me wrong, I like Spongebob, but it's nice to get a break from that show once in awhile!"
3,"Technically proficient, but emotionally immature","Kissin is still a youngster in the world of Chopin; as much as people like to put him on the pantheon of great pianists already, the truth is that his ideas of dramatic structure are vague, his phrasing is narrow and confined, and he has virtually nothing new or visionary to bring to the music. While he is technically proficient - almost perfect - so is Pletnev, or Volodos, or any one of many who have recorded the same pieces. I would recommend Cortot, Harasiewicz, Horowitz, Ohlsson or Pletnev for any Chopin fan who isn't swayed by the sensationalist hype surrounding Kissin. Give him 20 years, then see what he produces."
4,This is the only book that explains the OCF in details...,"As a person who is concerning in developing javacards via OCF, found this one very useful due to contents that it has on framework. You could get and develop off-card apps, if it does make sense to you.."
2,"Overprice, Underweight","For the price of this book (which I see has now gone up even more!) there's too little of substance here. This is a very thin book with too much space taken up telling us how smart cards are used in industry, business, etc. all of which has nothing to do with getting smart cards going in *your* application. If you needed convincing that smart cards are useful for business applications you wouldn't be looking for this book, would you?If you are an absolute beginner with smart cards you may get some useful tidbits of information here, but I don't think there's anything here you couldn't find through a couple hours of research via Google or from any smart card manufacturer's documentation. If this was a low cost beginning tutorial it might be of some value at one-fourth or one-fifth of its current price."
4,Smart card application development using Java,"I bought this book looking for a deeper reference regarding Javacard applets, native code in smartcards and so on. Neverthless I found the book very useful in the off-card stuff, because it explains in a very clear way how to access the terminal, send APDU's, etc., always using the Open Card Framework which is very important for us Java developers. I strongly recommend this if you are developing applications in Java that must access smartcards, but if you're developing also the on-card software, let's say the Javacard applets, then you must also get the book from Zhiqun Chen also available in amazon."
1,Too heavy based on OCF,The important thing that I notice is that the book is too heavily based on the Open Card framework. I needed instead a book on java card first. Only found some tutorials on the net until now.
5,Astonshing. Unforgettable.,"Riders in the Chariot is a supreme work of art. At least a dozen times, I found White's writing so moving and beautiful that I had to put the book down and reflect on what I'd just read. All too rarely has a book prodded me to deeply examine my own life and priorities -- this book is one of them. Riders in the Chariot provides a reaffirmation for the jaded 21st century reader: humilty over arrogance, beauty over ugliness, good over evil."
1,Mumbo-Jumbo,"Being a Miles Franklin award winner, I thought this book would be interesting. How wrong I was! Religious mumbo-jumbo with a bit of homosexuality thrown in for good measure. Patrick White must have been off with the fairies (he was one) on some serious drugs when he wrote this rubbish! None of the characters have any likeability, and the story itself is just not interesting. A complete waste of time, and it goes on and on and on. Reader beware!"
4,Good for the price,This stand feel sturdy and also looks much better than other cheap stands. I'm pretty satisfied with it. There are only two things I don't like: #1 it's not real wood (this is obvious since it's cheap). #2 those metal columns in the picture are fake. The columns are hollow plastic tubes with long bolts inside.
2,No directions on how to assemble this product,"Albny Plsm TV StdThis item was received from the seller on time to the shippers for me. I have just received the item in Barbados March 11, 2008 and was very excited to receive it but to my dissappointment on opening the box they are no instructions on how to assemble it. I have to go find someone who I think has a good idea on how to screw up all this little bolts and washers etc.in the right order. In other words we have to use trial and error to get this stand to function. Would be grateful if I can get some instructions on how to assemble this product in case my trial and error does not work."
3,The Magic Awakens,"Every great journey must start somewhere, and for fans of the Cirque this is a must have. But even those who wouldn't know the Grand Chapiteau from the Grand Canyon can enjoy this CD.The soundtrack for ""Cirque Reinvente"", the first touring production from Cirque du Soleil is good, but not great. While all the tracks are listenable, few have the ability to ""evoke, provoke, invoke"". ""Boules 1 á 3"" is one of the exceptional tracks that hints at what is to come in future productions. To get a better feel for the atmospheres of Cirque du Soleil, I'd recommend Alegria or Quidam. But there's certainly nothing wrong with a newcomer starting his or her exploration with this initial vision of things to come."
5,Great frame!,"Frame is sharp and shiny! If you use it on the back of the car, it will cover the registration stickers and you will have to remove it every year to replace the new ones. Looks hot though!"
4,The author captures the essence of the trail of tears.,Lucia St. Clair Robinson totally captures the reader into an ongoing stuggle between the Cherokee Nation with its trials and tribulations from their homeland of Tennesse and the complete stupid anarchy that the white man presented to the seven clans. Quite the captivating and thoroughly researched manuscript concerning the plight of yesteryears Indians just to survive a basic hostile takover of their homeland. To all of the people who like to read accounts of the trail of those who cry.
2,Unimpressed,"I'm sorry, but I just can't get into this author's writing style. I absolutely love the historical fiction of James Alexander Thom, and went looking for more historical fiction authors. This book was pretty difficult for me to wade through, to be honest. It took a long time, and I found it be extremely forgettable and unimpresive. Her style just doesn't work for me. I tried reading Light a Distant Fire and Ride The Wind, and couldn't fully get into those either. I suggest readign James Alexander Thom instead (Follow The River, From Sea To Shining Sea, Children of First Man, The Red Heart)."
4,"I am still in the midst of reading ""Walk in my Soul""","Walk in My Soul--I purchased this as an e-book for my Kindle (you did not provide that option)I am still in the midst of reading the book. I am pleased with the ways of the Indians are describe in great detail.The relationship between Indian people and white people is quite interesting, with some of them being trusted friends and others hated enemies!!Rogers is my mother's maiden name, and I believe that the Rogers in this story who lives with the Indians could very wellbe one of my ancestors! There are known ancestors in my family that have proved to be part Indian. Sam Houston plays an important part in my history of our family.So, as I read through this book, I feel like I am learning a lot about some of the history of my ancestry."
3,Good reading but too condensed...,"Starts well with interesting little stories, that become tedious and cover the main plot (s). The pages are too 'stuffed'. Written in small script, that would be double the 656 pg inregular size letering. Would have been better read if it was made into a 2 or 3 volume 'saga'. I had high hopes for it with all the 4* reviews but I just couldn't get in to it."
4,excellent depiction of addiction,"I liked the characters in this movie- especially the main character (the actress did a great job, very believable). It's basically a ""slice of life"" movie in which you view the movie through this character, since she is in almost every scence. It shows how her addiction destroys her relationship, friendship, job opportunities, and health.it was well written - using ""everyday street language""; the film was so real it felt like a documentary to me.this is a must-see for those interested in substace abuse, addiction, and recovery."
4,Gets the job done!,"Like the title says, it gets the job done. I used to go to a salon to get waxed, but decided to save some $$$ and do it myself. It can get a little painful and you begin to hesitate, but c'mon, it's not THAT painful, so man up! Overall, this is a great product and works well if used correctly."
1,Not good!,The wax was very thick even after I heated it 3 times in the microwave for about 10 seconds each time. It did not come off with the pads right away I had to go over the same spot (sometimes) a few times over to get it off. I won't be purchasing this product again.
2,Oh Dear,It works well for a few small areas. Forget about legs/chest...its WAY too much work. It was really messy and painful too.
1,it sucks,it sucks. it probably works with lots of practice but it's frustrating because you have to keep washing and drying the cloths.
3,"Not a well fit, cut or style","The goves are shape oddly. I have large yet slinder hands and these gloves don't look good on me, in comparison to other short style gloves I have by Alpinestar. The material and quality is supurb though. No photos do this product justice, you may like this style but I recommend seeing how it fits you before buying if you are concerned with fit."
5,Revealing stories,""" The Violence Prone Workplace is a revealing collection of true stories of troubled workers. The stakes are very high in these case studies. Richard Denenberg and Mark Braverman give us an invaluable resource for learning how to recognize these situations and deal with them constructively.""--Robert J. Rabin, Syracuse University"
2,Light Weight but Cheap,"Bought this tripod for use with a small spotting scope. The pan movement was not smooth at all. Even with the tension screw loosened all the way, the head would stick initially each time the head was panned from side to side. Overall quality of the tripod seemed cheap. Sturdy enough, but rough movements."
4,LIGHT WEIGHT....,I AM A PUSHOVER FOR CHRISTMAS MOVIES SO I ADDED THIS ONE TO MY COLLECTION. IT'S CUTE BUT NOT ESSENTIAL....
2,NOT ENTIRELY FAMILY FRIENDLY,"Some of the reviews I read here described this film as clean and family friendly. The vast majority of it is cute and family friendly. But, for what ever reason, those who made this film, (which is obviously a Christmas time film aimed at families with children),decided to toss in one God-dishonoring profane phrase in one, and only one, scene. Why????? I hope this film is not just the first of a new wave of cute ""Christmas time family movies"" that are ruined by the entirely unnecessary use of hard profanity in Christmas movies!"
5,Dear Santa,"Good movie, I actually like watching it with my wife. I caught myself smiling often it was so good. Good to add my ""Hallmark"" type library of films."
5,"Positive, uplifting and genuinely warm movie experience","The one thing I have noticed on many of these reviews is that we all keep watching this over and over again. I too have fallen under this movie's spell. Amy Acker (Crystal) is an absolute angel is this movie with eyes that will stop you in your tracks and a smile that melts your heart. Olivia is wonderful and makes you feel like she is truly falling in love with Crystal wanting her to be her new mom. Derrick is also terrific. He genuinely makes you believe he is falling in love with Chrystal. It certainly is one of my top 3 romantic movies of all time. Right there with ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've got mail."" I've already ordered this on DVD as it will definately become part of my yearly Christmas movie line-up. I wish they would have a follow-up movie. Crystal's parrents in the soup kitchen setting would be interesting to see."
5,Very entertaining,I adored it. I'd seen it on last year's Christmas movie line up and watched it. I will be ordering again.
4,Great,Great movie all around. Good acting. Gotta love the rich and how the good things just seem to land in their laps.
5,Sweet Story,"My mom, sister and I really liked this movie. It's a super sweet story, perfect for when you need some entertainment ""fluff"". Price and packaging were great too."
4,Dear Santa,Dear Santa is well worth the viewing. Good story line. The movie was wonderful for the season. Mostly light hearted.
3,"Use this book as study only, not to make a rocket belt!!","I found this book with a lot of information about the rocket belt, but please don't make a rocket belt following this plans because you will be killed, the control valve published in this book is totally wrong and not like the original, also the method of making the silver catalyst with samarium nitrate was done for electrolytic h2o2 and not for organic h2o2 because this catalyst is poisoned by the organic peroxide.The video have original footage of the Bell rocket belt fights.Use this book as a study book to understand the mechanics of the rocket belt but if you make one following this plans you will be killed or severely injured, I discussed this with the author.SincerelyJuan Manuel Lozano..."
2,dissapointed,"Tha penis pump needs a more stable cushon at the base, where the pump touchesyour body. With the thin plastic that separates the body from the pump, you lose suction,and this is very uncomfortable!!!!!!!A larger and thicker base bettwen thr body and the pump, would work and fell much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!Do you have anything like this avalable????????????If you do please let me know."
5,An Amazing Commentary on the Greek Text of Romans,"This commentary on Romans by Cranfield is by far the best ever written on the Greek text of Romans. His approach is to deal with each problem of interpretation by listing and describing the various options, then analyzing each in turn until he gives the reasons for his own conclusions. While you may not agree with his argumentation, you know that he has done a full analysis and presented good reasons for his views. Get both volumes, and forget the ""shorter"" one-volume edition."
1,Common Sense You Already Know!,"This book is full of common sense you already know. Let's see... is it important to be a mother? Well, yeah... who wouldn't argue with that? If someone doesn't already have common sense, then they are not magically going to get it from reading this book. Don't bother buying it for your niece or grandaughter about to graduate from college as they will easily see through this drivel. If you have a brain and use it regularly then you have no need for this book. I would be seriously insulted if someone gave it to me as a gift as it would imply that I lacked all common sense! This is one book to avoid..."
5,Good Book,"Bought two of these for granddaughters upon graduating high school. Maria shares good, everyday helpful hints and good ideas to apply in ""making it"" in this world of ours."
2,"Light,upbeat,but nothing totally new!","I've always been a fan of Maria Shriver & still think her and her husband are the more ""down to earth"" celebs...but.... on one hand,she tries very hard to be humble and criticize herself with humor to keep that ""I'm one of you"" images. On the other hand, her advice when given is hard to be taken seriously. Reading the book, I get the feeling her parents are more supportive than most and she is not just ""one of us"". I believe she works hard, but it only makes me feel worse that she could do all the career stuff and have a large family...it's a serious struggle for many who make huge sacrifices. I also think she doesn't reveal true feelings/genuine weaknesses all the time in this book. To me this book is not extremely helpful to the average person. Lessons nothing new, hard to internalize coming from someone of her upbringing. In conclusion, disappointed . May be helpful to some!"
2,Another book by a different author says it better,"In reading this book, I kept wondering, ""But where I have heard these similar opinions and phrases?"" Then I remembered, I'd recently finished a 1992 classic, Dr. Susan Jeffers book, Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway. Dr. Jeffers signature phrases are ""I'm creative, powerful, and I have nothing to fear,"" and her essential point throughout all her books is ""I CAN HANDLE IT!"" as she puts it -- the same phrases and advice Maria Shriver promotes as her own. Ms. Shriver's book is okay, but doesn't have the power, insight, originality of Dr. Jeffers, who includes very pragmatic exercises in her book and workbook to it."
1,Ten reasons to be born a Kennedy,"I scanned this book for about twenty seconds before flinging it back on the best-seller table at Borders. Only a silly child of a privileged American dynasty could write such dribble. Aristocratic Europeans would hestitate to so boldly offer advice on how to succeed at life when your own contribution is mostly to be spring from a blessed womb. I very much doubt that little Maria has ventured very far into the ""real world,"" and I doubt very much that anyone could think of ten good reasons to buy this ridiculous book, unless you are a combination self-help addict and Kennedy sycophant. (Of course, I forget that many, if not most Americans fit into at least one of these pathetic categories, so that may explain why this is a best seller.)"
4,to laugh,"to laugh, ah yes I laugh alot at all the things that bother me, to laugh at alcoholism and wish it would go away, to laugh at cruelty and not know why the cruel, why the alcoholic, but I laugh and make jokes to deal with it, of course I might ad I cry a lot too but I can always get back to the laughter, I also pray a lot too for prayer is the key to the door where God here's my painful laughter and unerstands too that Jesus died for them as well as for me, but yet it still hurts, just like He hurt hanging on that tree, and then I cry again, but I know he cares for them so I wait in joyful hope of what is to come. I hope you continue to be successful in writing and in laughing. Pat Kemm."
1,Good Grief people it's not like she actually WROTE this book,"Thousands of years ago when books were scarce, people would write things and attribute them to famous, dead people.Now that publishing is an industry, famous, live people hire people to ghost write books for which they can take the credit. Ms. Shriver has probably published more books than she has ever read. Of course, there's a family history for this sort of thing.After all, uncle Jack's book PROFILES IN COURAGE was ""ghosted"" by Ted Sorenson."
2,Exasperating,"Yet another rich and privileged person who is sure that she got that way by her virtue and hard work. One thing for which Ms. Shriver hasn't given credit in her book is how much luck, yes, luck, and the family into which we're born factors into success in all areas of life. Do every single thing Maria Shriver suggests in this book and you, too, can be married to a studly movie star and work at your convenience as a news magazine anchor and have all the nannies money can buy so you can have tons of kids and still have all the time and money for yourself that you need. Try it. I dare you. Let me know how it goes."
1,Real World? When has she been there?,"Why does America continue to buy such drival? I read this book in 22 minutes flat - borrowed from a friend. I think it took her that long to write it. Why do Hollywood types continue to think they can pen works of art? What she would have liked to have known before going into the real world? When HAS she gone into the real world? This is a person who has ridden the coattails of her family name, and now her husband. Her ""journalist"" work is as passionless as this worthless book."
1,A SHRIVELED SHRIVER,"The one thing I say now that I read this second book by Mrs. Arnold Schwarzenegger: Hasta la vista, baby."
1,What does a debutante know about the real world?,"I looked at the book jacket and laughed, i opicked up the book for fun and really began to laugh, You have to be kidding.pcs"
5,Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I went Out into the Real World,"This is a wonderful book. I am 49 and wish I would have had something like this when I was graduating from high school. I have decided that from now on, when I have a graduation gift to buy, this is what I will give because it's worth much more than the $25 to $50 we give for a high school graduation gift."
3,"Worth the Read, but Not the Money","Maria did have some excellent points. The majority of the book is just an autobiography, though, and I skimmed through those parts. My advice would be to stop by the book store and look at the table of contents and then the very end where she gives a list of some other things she wishes she knew, because they explain themselves. A lot of her things I already knew, and she points out that she's not trying to help us avoid those things, just let us know we're not alone. If the great, talented Maria could get through life, then we can too! That was sarcasm."
1,DISAPPOINTED IN VENDOR,Terribly disappointed as I received not only a USED book but a book that the previous owner had written inside :(
4,useful,"I am a working (outside the home)mother of two, and a bit younger than the author, and I found that although her ""10 things"" were basically common sense, it doesn't hurt to focus on them every once in a while. I listened to the audiobook on a couple-hour drive and found it entertaining and relevant. Sure, there's nothing earth-shaking, but although we all probably know these ""things"" deep down, we are often so busy with our kids, our jobs, our lives, that we don't take the time for a little self-reflection. And this is a good nudge toward self-reflection. It is true that in the financial sense she is not your average mom, but should that mean that she must be prohibited from offering advice to the rest of us? The angry, self-righteous, Kennedy-bashing seen in a lot of reviews is really unfortunate. Give her a break -- her heart's in the right place."
3,Eh.,"Sorry, Maria, but most people do not regularly spend their summers in the hamptons and get post-college jobs directly in their field of choice.Although this book does have some decent advice, I longed for Maria to tell some tale about how she suffered through a waitressing job at Bennigan's before getting into the career she REALLY wanted. Not so. She graduated from college and immediately got a career in television.Basically, this book has nothing that someone who HAS been in the real world can't tell you already. They might be able to even offer advice Ms. Shriver couldn't. Save your money; you'll need it to help pay next month's rent, you recent college grad, you."
1,"What, is she completely deluded?","She's a Kennedy. She's married to Arnold Schwarzenegger. How in the name of all things holy can she claim she ever ""went out into the real world""?For further evidence of what a waste of paper this is, here is a sample of the wit and wisdom of the author, from an exchange in a yahoo chat session:normal_person_at_computer asks: Where do you see America in 50 years? maria_shriver_live: Good question. I think it depends on who leads it. And I think if that person is a kind and compassionate leader you'll see a different America than with someone who is not. (source: http://chat.yahoo.com/c/events/transcripts/authors/041700shriver.html)Gosh, thanks Maria! In any event, this book is chock full of depressing platitudes. At heart, it was a really cynical enterprise. It made me really sad."
1,Something an 8th grader could write in 45 minutes,"Maria Shriver's book, ""Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out into the Real World"" really could have been written by an 8th grader in 45 minutes. Here is a person whose uncle was President John F. Kennedy, one of the greatest Prsidents of the USA. Ms. Shriver has written a rather simplistic booklet on life. Her husband is the current governor of California. With all that experience one would think that a more sophisticated write would abound. However, we find this booklet a simple 20 minute read. One star is a gift to this ""book""."
3,Four years ago I loved this book,"I bought this book for years ago when I graduated from high school thinking I'd get a ""head start"" on the game and planning ahead for my future. Four years have passed and I have since graduated from college and the whole finding-a-job thing is a lot harder than Maria makes it out to be. She seems to skim over the whole part about actually finding a job soon after graduation. I guess she doesn't know what it's like to send out nearly fifty resumes and still be unemployed. Or go on dozens of interviews and not get the job. Maybe she did experience this but neglected to include it in the book. Big mistake--how can you find your ""passion"" if you can't get the job first? Had I reviewed this book four years ago I would have given it five stars because, for me, the future seemed so open and optimistic. Now, after rereading this book, I realize my life will never even come close to Maria's."
3,A Gift for Young Women,"""Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went into The Real World"" is very inspiring and motivating, espescially for young women like me. It's more important that the book written by Maria Shriver, a member of the great Kennedy family, who is 'different' from the other members of the family. (How should I explain the word 'different' here? She is different indeed). Reading the book, I beleive in the differences more.I am also a young mother, a presenter at a jazz radio station in Bandung Indonesia, and I'm glad to know that Maria cancelled an interview with Kuba's President Fidel Castro for her child's first day school. It convinced me that children and family are the most important in the life of a women. I also agree with Maria that marriage is a hard work, and I appreciate she do hers well. I wish this book could be translated into Bahasa Indonesia, as a gift for young Indonesian women."
1,"Why, Oh Why?","Heaven help us all. As a recent grad, I received no less than 4 copies of this book, from well-meaning aunts and such. All I have to say is this...what pap! What unadulterated hackneyed tripe! Ms. Shriver is certainly graced with extraordinary self-confidence if she felt that it was appropriate to create and market this collection of fortune cookie platitudes. Maybe we should all take a lesson....this is America, and schlock sells....No matter how putrid an idea, someone will want to buy it."
2,Ten things I wish I'd known,"I'm a femal reader, I think I expected more from this book. In my opinion, this book is very superficial. There is no question that Maria Shriver is a very accomplished person,but as far as her book is concerned, I think she is better in her special reports on TV."
5,"Excellent life ""guard""/guide!","In this book, Arnold Schwarzenegger's precious wife puts things into focus. She's blunt and direct, explaining that success is not that easy to come by and success is never a freebee. The book contains lots of valuable lessons on life and it's a life guide and to many perhaps even a life ""guard"" so to speak. Mrs. Shriver is honest about her own challenges to live up to the measurements of her parents and now being a parent and so forth. In short: it's an excellent book. Another book that I highly recommend as it deals bluntly with key issues in life and is extremely helpful, is Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression."""
4,The evil of savagery,"A wonderful little film about the evil of savage society. As a woman becomes civilized she learns to love, but her old superstitions make her decision a difficult one."
1,"This book contains lots of awful, inaccurate nonsense","Please don't waste your time on this book. The theory lessons are incomplete and contain gross, weird inaccuracies! But don't take my word for it. Show the lesson in this book titled ""the seventh scales"" to a good music teacher, and I guarantee they will tear it apart."
3,A Fiedler fun fest....,"This compilation is a nostalgic romp! Through his long career Fiedler and the Boston Pops shared the stage with many accomplished soloists. He insisted that one appear with him for every concert and this CD is a sample of such talents. It is a mixed bag with mixed results. The Al Hirt and Duke Ellington arrangements come off the best! Some of the performances are recorded live, some are studio, making for uneven soundthrough out. The engineers do a good job with the remastering but balancing is a problem. The Pennario and Leontyne Price selections seem out of place hear, more like to fill up the 68min. disc. The Nero-Haymanarr. of ""I Got Rhythm"" is performed at break neck speed. I prefer the composers own version. All in all this is a pleasant program that can be obtained at a bargain price. Charming annotation by Fiedler's daughter Johanna is included."
3,"An extremely demeaning, dismissive view of Jesus","Nino Ricci is a skilled writer, and his description of scenery and of some of the characters is excellent. However, sooner or later, each of the narrators begins to talk like a Greek philosopher -- even the non-Jewish peasant. At times, Ricci thinks he is Charles Dickens. His description of the 10 year old Jesus running around the streets of Alexandria with his ""gang"" makes him sound like the Artful Dodger. I laughed out loud. All in all, Jesus doesn't seem to be the kind of person who would inspire his followers to invent a new religion, or at least a cult. He is, more or less, a nobody, who has no real mission, no plan and little purpose. I have read many versions of the life of Jesus, fictional and non-fictional, and in none of them does he seem so insignificant. Any stature that Jesus has must come from one's own knowledge of the gospels and history of the times. Without such knowledge, this Jesus is something of a bore."
2,Edited Monster Episode,"Although MXC is a great show, I sadly have to give the DVD only 2 stars for editing the best episode on the set."
5,MXC Season 2 DVD,"Great show! I couldn't stop watching these when they came to me, perfect for any MXC fan, or for those who just like a rather pointless and very humourous TV show."
3,"Edited Episode?? Indeed, Ken!","I was waiting for this one, because it would hold my favorite episode, MONSTERS Vs. MASCOTS (aka The Monster Show).Got it home, & I see on the INSIDE packaging ""HIGHLIGHTS"" - Edited from Broadcast version. NOOOOOOOOPop it in & sure enough, EVERY rubber-suited monster scene is edited OUT. The beginning, where Vic & Ken gather the monsters, sinkers & floaters cut up, Muddy Balls cut up, and Stones of Mount McKidney COMPLETELY cut.The only thing I can think of is it had to get cut due to copyright problems. The monsters are mostly Ultraman & Dynaman critters, and an ARMY of Ultramen fight them off at the end. The character dubbed ""Piss In Boots"" is actually an Astroboy-like costume, so that's why HE's out. Ah well.. At least I have it on VHS from broadcast. So word of warning - if you HAVE it from broadcast, DON'T ELIMINATE YOUR TAPE!!! INDEED!!!!"
5,The must see series of the year!,"If you ever seen this show it speaks for itsself. Having them all on one collection is terrific, and every bit as good as season 1.This show is abslutely hilarious. If you haven't seen it you are truely missing out. Sometimes the commentary is a little lame but the action and extreme eliminations of the day more than make up for it. Add in a couple beers and a couple friends and max out the comedy of this one!"
5,This worked great for our cat .,"Our cat slept quietly for the day and a half drive she took when her blanket was sprayed with Feliway by Comfort Zone. The last time she rode in the car she cried the whole time, even with a sedative the vet had prescribed for her. This time she slept quietly for hours and when she woke at the hotel she was alert and exploring her environs. When the Feliway spray seemed to wear off in the car, I sprayed the blanket she was on (while at a rest area or food stop - outside of the car) and she slept again. When she arrived at our destination she was alert and ready to explore her new surroundings. It did not over sedate her, but made her ride (and ours) much more comfortable."
4,Please Write Number 4,"The (so-far) ultimate book in a very entertaining series. Please Please Mr Stasheff write more. As a theatre professional who loves science fiction I beleive you have caught much of the truth behind ""The show must go on"". Sure your characters are stereotypes but stereotypes only survive because there is some truth in them. Press on."
3,"Sevengood songs, the rest is awful!","I bought this cd after purchasing Hitler Bad, Vandals Good and I loved the first song Wanna Be Manor. The next five songs were the vandals at it's best! Urban Struggle and Anarchy Burger are some of the best songs EVER written! Then once you get into When In Rome Do As The Vandals it gets quite bad. Ladykiller is a decent song but then it sounds all the same from there. There is little comedy and the songs are repetitive and boring. Overall this is a poor vandals album. Peace Through Vandalism is awesome, probably the greatest but too bad there are only six songs and the rest is probably the worst stuff the Vandals have ever put out."
5,Peace thru vandalism is great,"this was the first vandals music I listened to, and my recording is so old, it's a record (it was my brother's-I wasn't born that early.) I love Pirate's Life, Anarchy burger (Hold The Government) and Steve-o was the best, I think. His lyrics are usually pretty funny, and the new guy is ok, but not as good as Steve-o. Anyway, this is a record (cd, tape) that you'll want to have if you like the Vandals."
3,"Different sound, different members, great punk energy.","If you like the Vandals of the present, don't expect to find them on this record. Every member of the band on this c.d. is different, with exception of Joe (who now plays bass but plays drums on this). The sound is even different from the Vandals now. But never the less, it's got some good songs. The first record on this c.d. (Peace Through Vandalism) is great. Every song is awsome. But the second record (When in Rome do as the Vandals) is pretty much a drag. They're aren't really any truly good songs on it. But no matter, the first six songs make up for the 10 remaining tracks making it a wise purchase to add to your punk collection."
5,Two great DVDs inside!,This item comes packaged with two disks inside which makes it easy to share with a friend! The routines progress from basic to advanced with really young to actual parents of the instructors participating in the background in one segment. Really classy stuff!
4,Good moves,"The moves are good but the instruction moves pretty fast for a beginner. IF you have some basic hip/hop moves down, this video may add some flare but if your a beginner, be prepared to hit the rewind button a lot."
1,don't buy,"This is the worst ""learn to hip hop"" dvd. I bought it for my 6 year old. It is so ""old school"" like the 90's maybe. They don't teach you little moves they teach you a whole routien. NOT worth it at all."
2,Ok.,My 11 year old did not like it. She was okay with the parts Shane Sparks was in but did not like to simple way they break down the steps. Will try to get her to watch completer DVD.
3,"Learn To Hip Hop Collection (Vol. 1, 2 & 3) / Featuring Shane Sparks (2009)","It's not what I expected. Suitable for early teenage eventhough the dance look nice. I only like the part featuring Shane Sparks, which was very short time."
4,Meet Sneazle review,"Very colorful book, cute characters, easy to read and a good message. Book pages are tear resistant and water proof. Recommended for young children!"
2,Earrings are MUCH larger than they appear in picture,"These earrings are much larger than most studs and look awkward in the ear because of it. When held next to a pearl earring, for example, they are considerably larger."
5,Every kids dream job,"Covers the history of animation, how it is used today, specialized roles of animators, education requirements and the future of the industry. Appealing format for young people in grades 5-9. Colorful photographs enhance the easy to understand text."
2,The Turning Point,"Very difficult to read, you need to be keen on the subject matter to keep the interest up to plough through this one."
3,Great find,"Found this today at the annual library sale for $2 and this was right after showing my class the movie ""Mind Walk"" which is based on the book. Talk about coincidence! I have ""The Web of Life""."
5,Important messages,"I think Fritjof Capra is making some very important observations in this book. Through his observations, the author states that Western Civilization is gradually approaching the climax of a major turning point in its evolution. He suggests that the cause of this is in our consciousness, a certain way we are seeing and understanding our experiences. This is leading to many of our present day environmental, social, political, and financial crises. We are all sitting on a treebranch that is gradually getting too heavy. Many modern theorists try to explain this phenomena but Capra articulates this in a way that many people can understand. This book as well as ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato do a very fine job in trying to open the public eye to these issues. Both of these books are highly recommended for people who want to understand things from a wider, larger, and deeper perspective."
5,Cats Rule The Night,"On a Foggy Christmas Eve, Santa is trying to see his way to deliver presents. When the cats realize Santa has not delivered presents (especially catnip), they unite to form a line of almond shaped lights (cat eyes glowing in the dark).The cat's eyes,like a runway,were easy to follow,So Santa and reindeertook off likeApollo.All the cats purr and meow and help Santa find the houses. This is an amusing story for cat lovers and has some highly imaginative moments. Yes, this is a perfect stocking gift that will be enjoyed by young children and feline fans everywhere.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Poor Toaster,"This is fine to use as an oven, and the convection fan does speed up the cooking process. However this is a very poor toaster. My toast never browned evenly, and I had to always flip over the bread to ensure both sides were toasted well. As a result, I returned this item back to Amazon. I'm a little surprised as I've owned a different model of Delonghi convection oven in the past that worked very well. If you're going to use this as a toaster, I don't recommend it."
2,Disappointment,"Don't pay extra for this just for the name. It is poorly designed - once you turn on the toaster, you cannot shut it off, you have to wait for the timer to run itself out. The broiler does not get hot enough to brown food and the broiler pan's non-stick coating started peeling after the second use, despite using recommended cleaning products."
1,Another One Bites the Dust,Unfortunately we bought this convection toaster oven before reading all the warnings that were posted about the machines breaking after just a few months. We had ours for about 3 months and the other day it just stopped working. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TOASTER OVEN. It's not worth the hassle.
5,ben,Oven bakes better than our full sized oven. Biscuits rise higher and more even browning. Easy to use.
2,I loved it till it broke,"I registered for and received this as a bridal shower present. It is pricey but it was worth it to me for an appliance I use multiple times a day (I only like to microwave water). It isn't great for toast as it only really gets one side at a time and the door did stick occasionally but it worked great for cooking and reheating things. Yesterday (after just over 2 years of use) it stopped working in the middle of a toast cycle. After coming on here I was able to determine that it was the thermal fuse and was able to fix it, but I really expected better from such an expensive appliance. Without the internet I would have had to throw it away and that is unacceptable.Edit -Well, after another 8 months of use the controls broke so that it would randomly switch itself on and since the only way to keep it off was to unplug it I finally got rid of it."
1,GOOD LUCK AT CLOSING THE DOOR!,"I have owned several Delonghi toaster ovens. THe convection feature is great, it is quick to cook and cooks evenly. However, the number one capability of any toaster oven should be the ability to open and close the door securely. After just several months of use, not to mention several hundred dollars spent, the doors of these ovens will not close all the way...this resulted in inconsistent cooking temperatures in the interior of the oven. In short, we could not trust the oven to cook something properly. For the money, Delonghi should be able to install a decent door latch...that is not asking for too much I don't think. Even a 19.00 Proctor Silex from Walmart has achieved this engineering feat.Also, the toaster function is very slow....my great grandmother can cook toast faster and she is blind, uses a walker, and cooks on a wood stove."
1,"Horrible, stopped working after 3 months...","I purchased this to replace an older, non-convection toaster oven. This DeLonghi model had been working fine up until last week, when it just stopped working while it was in use. I've only had it for 3 months and used it only a couple of times per week. I'm very disappointed and would not recommend this purchase."
4,PEELING TEFLON COATING,OVEN WORKS VERY WELL BUT WITHIN DAYS THE TEFLON COATING ON THE GRILL RACK BEGAN TO BLISTER AND PEEL...WHICH I SUSPECT RESULTED IN MY CONSUMMING SOME TEFLON....CALLED DELONGI AND REQUESTED REPLACEMENT BUT NO RESPONSE.
1,Poor customer service - Don't buy DeLonghi products,Purchased top of line model for convection oven ($165 3 years ago). Heater elements broke and DeLonghi no longer carries repair parts. Spoke with customer service manager who promised to replace unit in kind because I could not get replacement parts. They ended up replacing my expensive convection oven with a $79 toaster oven. I wouldn't spend the money on a DeLonghi product again.
1,QUIT WORKING AFTER 49 DAYS,"I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS POSTS....I HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR 49 DAYS AND IT JUST UP AND QUIT....HARDLY USED IT, ONCE A DAY TO COOK LUNCH FOR MY 3 Y/O DAUGHTER. THATS IT, NOTHING REAL DEMANDING, MAYBE 15 MINUTES OF USE A DAY, MORE OR LESS. THE PRODUCT WORKED GREAT, RIGHT UP TO THAT POINT. I AM IN THE PROCESS WITH DEALING WITH DELONGHI NOW...WE'LL SEE. I WOULD NOT PURHCASE THIS PRODUCT OR ANOTHER FROM DELONGHI. 49 DAYS IS RIDICULOUS, ESP. WHEN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.. I SMELL A LEMON COOKING."
2,toaster oven,"I found this machine not to be the best. The turn knobs are very finicky, and they can break very easliy. You cannot stop the timer even when the toast is finished. You have to let it run it's course. Very annoying."
5,Oh My God! It fits! Finally!,"I mean, it has been a stressful experience, trying to find a case to fit the 60-gig Gizmo. (The 60 gig gizmo is wider than the 30 gig, so the case has to be wide enought. That has been the problem in some cases.)Finally, mission impossible has been accomplished. All is well. Tell the Lady in the Lake, Camelot has a king again!It's a sturdy leather case, with a belt clip, and holes in the right place for ear phone and charger connections. It will protect the Gizmo nicely. I mean, I could just put my gizmo in the fabric pouch and stick it in my pursie, or in my pocket to power walk, but my son (an electrician) was banging the heck out of his gizmo. Now he can cover his and protect it."
4,Martiniduck,"The case looks good. It protect the player. The leather is kind of stiff and can cause multiple buttons to be press. Also the player tends to slide in the case, but that is not realy a problem. If you have the Creative Lab Zen Vison M, you really need a case. That player shiny surface scratches just by looking at it. Overall it is a good case for the price. Go Bears!!!"
1,Case is worthless,"This case is useless. It looks nice but is really only a thin veneer of leather over cardboard and fabric. When the player is in the case, the buttons don't work."
2,Not what I hoped for...,"When I first put the player in the case, the elastic on the side was too strong and was holding the buttons down preventing the player from working. After stretching it a little the problem ceased. However, the leather covering the control buttons is too thick and stiff. I have had to press control buttons several times to get them to work. Even after flexing the case for several minutes to soften the leather, I cannot get the ""short cut"" button to work. Very frustrating. The excess glue inside the case left a sticky residue on the player that had to be washed off. Lastly the stitching inside the case is very rough and is likely to leave scratches on the finish."
3,It's ok.,"I have a 60 gig Vision M, & the case seems a little tight for the unit. I noticed some scratches on the face of the player from just sliding it in & out of the case a couple times.I think I'll get a skin for it & see if I like that better."
1,Not a good case for the Zen,"The case is not real leather, its some paper-plastic laminated material that is way too stiff and doesn't allow one to easily operate the front panel controls. The flexible plastic window arrived scratched and I eventually removed it from annoyance. Don't buy this case, get one of those flexible silicone rubber cases with a hard plastic window."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I'm not sure what product every previous purchaser received, but the case I received doesn't cut it for the 60GB. It fits in so tighly that the case depresses the buttons so that the user can not push them. I do NOT recommend this product for the 60GB. I suppose we Zen 60GB owners must resign ourselves to the fact that only those stupid skins will fit our players."
4,Fun old Simian tracks...,"This is the first Never Be Alone EP, with the 2nd EP also being found here on Amazon. There's a third maxi-CD (SOURCDJX067) which combines the two but leaves out the Never Be Alone video. If you're into Simian but not a completist, the maxi-CD might be the best choice.By themselves, I find these tracks to be more curiosities than anything else. But Never Be Alone remixed very well, and these tracks aren't available on any other releases that I've heard of."
3,Having a weak joint.,"It's a great sculpture. It is a good figure. It has a very good height about 10 inches. But, having a weak joint."
2,Analytical Robotics and Mechatronics,"This is a book about industrial Robot, not for habit reader. This may be good text book for higher Education. It contains very hard physic equations, hard to understand. Unfortunately, The writer has not put enough explanation for the equation. Understand University Physic before read this book."
1,I never Recieved this album Kenny wheeler What Now,I am very dissapointed in how I have ordered this item and still yet to receive it. It has been over a month and still waiting...........
2,Religious book,It is more about Christian belief than raising a child. Not recommended for a father to get tips on how to raise a son. Interesting enough I got it for free.
1,Only good if you believe in god,I guess I should have read the description a little better or it should have been more in depth. The whole book pretty much says if you don't believe in god then you're son will grow up with no morals or ethics. I'm an athiest but my wife is catholic so that's a war in itself. But besides that I guess if you believe in god then you should read this book.
2,Mediocre book,"I saw this on a friends bookshelf and skimmed through it. In about 20 minutes, I found several things that were either misleading or totally false. Then, I tried Googling the author to see what his credentials were (I had never heard of the guy). Big surprise, can't find anything. You are way better off buying something by Paxton Quigley."
3,it's okay,"i'm a big guy 6'3"" 250, so I ordered the XXL. it fits, but the sleeves go down to my fingertips. the shirt has small arm-holes, so it fits tight though the armpits... like the '70's t-shirts you'd buy as a kid. one complaint- the stripes are screen printed on the shirt, not sewn. i don't remember seeing that in the product description."
4,A very fun and easy to use toy,"We bought this toy for my 6 year old son for Christmas. He loves it. He dosn't have the best controll over where it flies but that dosn't really matter to him. He thinks it is fun to crash it into everyone and everything. The toy seems very breakable. It is made out of some really lite styrofoam. When we opeaned it we thought there was no way it would survive the day but it is now the second day and it has survived some pretty hard crashes and is still running great. My brother got on for his 3 year old son and he loves it too. He is able to fly it himself, with a lot of crashes. His, sadly flew under someones foot and got stepped on but with a little bit of tape it's still flying. I bought this to for 20-something dollars and thought that was a good price but I definatly would not pay much more than that for it."
3,"Not great, but ok.","My son was thrilled with this toy initially, but the tail broke after only a few minutes of flying. The upside is that it could be easily fixed with tape. All in all it's not the greatest toy and it is somewhat difficult to fly, but it is ok. Because it's difficult to fly, my son lost interest after a few days."
3,Fun for a few minutes!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas last year and he did indeed love it, but it quickly broke with regular, expected ware. NOTICE: they sell a ton of little replacement parts which means that this little toy tends to fall apart and need them! Would not recommend if you are on a strict budget, because you will be disappointed!"
2,Crap...,"I bought 10 of these(never going to buy again)about 2 years ago and they are all at the landfill right now. The first one the gear came off of the shaft so I threw it out, next one was the havoc heli laser battle, those just completely died, 3rd was a blue helicopter I flew it outside and it fell on a rooftop and I never saw it again. (skipping forward) then one day I had a boxfull of busted havocs and made my own. That lasted about a year till it decided to commit suicide. So instead of buying this first, please consider the syma s107 or the pocket copter, the s107 can fly up, down, side to side, and forward and backward. It is also very durable and EXTREMELY EASY to fly. The pocket copter is very fast, durable, and fun."
1,Worked for the first 5 min.,I guess this is another one of the category you get what you pay for.stop working after 5 min.if only there was an option to give zero stars...
1,Not the same product as described,I ordered this product after watching the video. The video shows a helicopter with durable bendable landing gear. The one I got has thin plastic landing gear. It also says it charges in 15 minutes for 10 minutes of flight time. the directions that came with my product says it takes 30 minutes to charge and only flies for 6 minutes. Once I finally got it charged it would only fly in circles and any direction I tried to turn it it would simply ignore my controls. Not happy and returning the product.
2,Broke within minutes - first charge!,"Pick this up at ToysRUs for my 5-year-old.Pros:- Simple- Inexpensive.- Charges pretty quick.Cons- VERY hard to control- Trim doesn't work that well. Turned right at first, so I trimmed it left. Got it stable for a bit then it just spun left and wouldn't trim back right.- Still on the first charge, after about 7th or 8th attempt to fly, one of the weighted bits on the smaller rotor broke off.- Others say they had to weight it to fly fwd. This one flew fwd on it's own, with no way to stop it.Taking it back. Will look at sharpshooter or S107 as others have suggested."
1,don't waste your money,"This toy lasted all of 3 hours. It was difficult to control so it took some time to get good at flying it. It, unfortunately, could not hold up to crashes. After several mild crashes, the heli broke and was not fixable."
1,Broke immediately,"My son didn't even have the toy out of the box when the tail broke from the helicopter. We tried to fix it, but it was shot. He didn't even get to use it."
1,Junk,"The main reason I don't complete these reviews is because most do not require more than a few words, so, I just copy and paste this each time. Stars is enough."
1,Broken Helicopters!!,These started out great and tons of fun. We bought the battling helicopters for my son's 8th Cristmas. First one broke but my son was okay since he still had the other. By June they had both broken.
3,re Air Hogs Havoc Heli,Not seen as sent as bday gift to a grandson. Said didn't have any batteries so was still waiting to get some the last I heard!That disappointed me.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NSFO3W/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,Doesn't Fly,"i would not suggest this toy for anyone. it barely stay up, requires constant charging, and doesnt fly ""up"". my nephew won't talk to me b/'c of it.thanksc"
1,Horrible.,"This, like all of the Air Hogs, is designed to last 5 minutes. Piece o' Crap, not worth buying. It'll break before you can have any fun. Also, note that if you want to return it to the manufacturer, they're in Ontario and the cost to ship it back is about the cost of the crap."
1,very dissapointed,I PURCHASED THE HAVOC HELI FOR MY FATHER AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. IT WAS DEFECTIVE. IT WOULD FLY UPWARDS BUT YOU COULD NOT CONTROL IT. ONCE AIRBORNE YOU COULKD NOT LAND IT OR CONTROL IT. IT WOULD JUST DIVE TO THE GROUND OUT OF CONTROL. AFTER ABOUT FIVE TRYS THE ROTAR BLADE WAS DAMAGED. THIS WAS A VERY DISSAPPOINTING GIFT AND SO FAR I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DETERMINE HOW OR TO WHOM I NEED TO SEND THE DAMAGED HAVOC HELI BACK TO FOR A REFUND OR A REPLACEMENT..
3,air hogs,You get about what you pay for. With a little practice you can fly these things. But the remote doesn't have anywhere near the range advertised. You have 20 feet max then they drop like a rock. I would recommend them for a cheap way to enjoy SHORT flights.
3,poor level of control,"I was reasonably impressed at first; reasonably powerful, and it wasn't too hard to get it to go up and down. Once I got past that, though, it was useless. It's supposed to be possible to steer it, but first it's nearly impossible to get it to avoid turning left and right, and second, it would not move forward. My children kept playing with it for several days though.It survived many, many crashes by my children, but still broke (a crack in one leg) in the first day or two of play."
5,I have the whole fleet,"I have the whole fleet, and have been playing with them on and off over the past 3 years. Now my grandson asked Santa for one. So being a good grandpa I got him two.... When one runs out of gas, he can fire up the other, by time it's out of gas the first will be charged and ready to go. I have a blast buzzing grandma, and the doggies! I've flown real helicopters in my lifetime, and these are easier to fly and no threat of life and limb, unless a rotter blade got ya in the eye or something.... I've got them stuck in the doggies fur once or twice though. OOPS! Gotta get the tweezer and clean the hairs out or it will make them fly funny! These are really durable too, they can take allot of wall crashes or fall from the ceiling onto the floor and their good to go again and again. I can see me and the grandson angage in mid air warfare soon.... hehehe!!! ya, eat my dust junior, and grandma, and the doggies better run for cover!"
3,Fun to fly but hard to control. I'll spend more $ for more control,"This is a good intro into RC Heli. I have very large rooms with high ceilings that made the low level of directional control easier to work with. To give you some idea, I would say that flying this is kinda like going down a river in a round raft with only one small paddle. It is more of a case of spinning and trying to stop once you are facing the direction you want. The copter descends faster when turning one direction and ascends faster when turning the other. It laso make tighter counter clock wise turns than clock wise. This may be due to the direction the blades are spinning. They provide adhesive weights to place on the nose for forward momentum, but I found a pushpin works better. My over all rating is 3 1/2 starts. I am not unhappy with the purchase. Great price and would spend more money in the future for more control."
3,Misleading,"The writeup and commercial are misleading. I bought the toy believing you could steer the copter right and left, but your only controls are up/down (altitude) and rotation to the right and left. It's extremely difficult to go forward while turning and very unintuitive."
1,Usless,"I consider this a real piece of junk. The vertical control is extremely sensitive and after more or less mastering that I find that directional control is non-existant. It is a little bit of fun, but the lack of directional control makes it really usless."
4,Better than you'd think,"Our four-year-old grandson wanted a helicopter disparately for his birthday. But we did not want to buy him something that would frustrate him. So, his grandfather bought it for himself. He practiced flying it and then invited the grandson over. It's a bit tricky to fly, mind you. But the four-year-old has flown it better or least as well as everyone else.It's light weight and likely won't last past Christmas, as it crashes from ceiling to floor constantly. Meanwhile, it is a heckofalotafun. Put a little blob of modeling clay on the nose and it is easier to control, by the way. And Elmers glue fixes the bottom wing things pretty well. Have fun and don't take it too seriously."
4,Fun Little Toy!,"This is the toy that began my interest in r/c planes and helicopters. It does take a little practice for anyone who isn't familiar with the controller but after 10 minuets I think you'd be set! This thing was hours of entertainment for me and I even flew it around my room when I was bored, no small feat my room is very tiny. The only problem I have with it, is that once the Li-Po battery wears down you are done, no replacement batteries. However they do last for a couple months and really are almost crash proof (I definitely put mine to the test). Overall it's an absolute buy and a fun introduction to r/c helis!"
2,Uncontrollable,I could get the aircraft to pickup and eventually hover but there is no such thing as getting that thing to go in the direction you want it to. I put the aluminum weights on the nose to get it to move forward that way all I had to do was turn it in the direction I wanted it to go. It is very difficult and is no way as easy as it looks on TV. And I've practiced a lot.
3,nice product ... not very durable,really nice product for the initial cost ... just not very durable. costs $50 incl shipping & worked about ten times (about 5 min each time) before it died. so if you don't mind paying $1/min for your kids to fly a mini-chopper then you should buy it ... actually not a terribly bad deal in my opinion ... which is why i gave it 3 of 5 stars.
3,You get What you pay for,"The toy is a good learning tool for flight dynamics. I wished the battery lasted longer and that the constant turning was more controlable. Overall, a good product for the money."
2,Really fun but broke within a 1/2 hour,"For Christmas, we bought 3 of these for our 3 kids (2 teenagers, and a pre-teen). They were a big hit and really fun. However, within the first 1/2 hour of play, one had the little tiny piece that holds the propellers in place snap off. (It didn't even crash!) Thus, no more use for this helicopter. The other two are still working fine but now I am nervous about how long they will last. At $40.00 a piece this was an expensive 1/2 hour of play. As far as I can tell there is no way to order replacement parts. Needless to say we have a very disappointed teenager."
2,Broken in two days!,"Out of the package, this toy was pretty easy to set up. The learning curve for my 8 year old son was about 5 minutes who had figured out the ""trim"" functions and was able to fly this around the house like he had been doing it for years. The problem we had was the charge interface. There is a small charging wire that you pull out of a slide opening in the face of the remote. The wire then plugs in to a VERY small female receptor on the cockpit of the chopper. You need to make sure that the plug is pushed in the right direction, because you can push hard enough and make the plug go in either way...which I'm assuming is the reason our charger broke. We haven't been able to use it since (I'm in the midst of sending it back)."
1,Worthless,"I bought this for me and it did not get off the ground. As soon as i took it out it started to spin uncontrollbly and crashed. I tried again after charging with same results and it got mixed debris in the propellers. This is not worth your money, please dont buy it."
2,Fun but cheap,"Very addictive and fun to fly, but after a few crashes, it's broken ;-( I can't understand why they would include a tail rotor replacement, but no main rotor replacement. After a few crashes, the main split. A little scotch tape patch up job got it flying again, but then the little weight on the stabilizer (upper propeller flew off and almost hit me in the eye. A little super glue got it flying again, but it didn't hold. It flew off somewhere and I think the cat ate it. This is the 3d Havoc I've owned, and they all break within a few days. If they would provide replacement rotors for the main, than I would go out and buy another one, but these little buggers are playing HAVOC with my bank balance!"
1,Air hogs has way better choppers for the same money,"Peice of crap, would not trim out, crashed several times until it no longer took off due to damaged rotors. returned to the store for a refund and got the Sharpshooter model. much more stable design, trim actually works and it flies without crashing"
1,This is for older kids or collectors only,My two boys played with the helicopters and they flew around the house and crashed into everything and were broken within only a few days. I saw them and didn't think they were overly hard on the toys but they were difficult to handle and did not sustain the crashes into the walls and floor very well. I would not buy anything like this again unless it was for a serious child with a serious collection that would take time from other collectors to sup up the helio so it would actually function.
1,"Good Idea, not kid durable",I have purchased two helicopters in the last two days(or exchanged rather b/c it was a Christmas gift). My son is very careful using remote control vehicles and is not rough. The first copter lasted 10 minutes until it hit a wall. The second lasted most of the afternoon until the propeller hit the Christmas tree branch and the plastic piece broke. It is a great concept but really cannot withstand normal bumps and blunders. The moto frenzi made by Air Hogs has the same flawed design...can't withstand bumps while children learn to work the remote.
1,Never Worked,"Helo over-rotated from the beginning. I was never able to correct it per instructions. While some reviews claim 5 minutes of fun, I never had one second of use. Hopefully I can take back. I have a feeling the Salvation Army is going to get flooded with donated RC helos."
1,Horrible RC Helicopter,"Simply the worst of available RC products out there. Lots of trimming, low play/use time and EXTREMELY short battery life. Worked for all of one week and charge will not fly beyond two minutes. HORRIBLE PRODUCT! The ONLY positive is that it's durable - and literally - that's it! Don't waste your time or money."
4,"Good, but...","I've been through 4 of these little guys. Battery failure, motor frying, and the little rotor replacement is to sensitive when replacing, I pulled out some wires.Good fun, but...Why pay more for something not really worth it?The Syma S107, is the stuff.Durable, reliable, and easier to fly."
1,This Helicopter is terrible!,"I would not reccomend this piece of junk to anyone. I got this for my son for Christmas and it was a disappoint from the start. First of all, the battery only holds a charge for a minute or two. After that you will be lucky to have it hover inches above the ground. Secondly, once it does fly you better not run into anything because it will surely break. Save your money for something else because this thing absolutely sucks!!!!!!!!"
4,Delicate but fun for grownup kids,"ok when I first got this out of the box i was a little disappointed by the seemingly flimsy stryofoam body,but after taking a licking during my learning curve of crashes and one chow(dog) attack I have come to appreciate how durable styrofoam is - the toy itself takes a good bit of finesse-ie small movements to get it under control but once you grasp this its alot of fun , i wouldnt suggest for kids under 12 though just cause of the patience it takes to learn to fly it perhaps even buy 2 and sacrifice one for the learning curve. be wary though prices VARY greatly in my opinion not worth more than 25 [...] tops -but tons of fun-T"
4,so-so,"I purchased this as a gift for my nephew. Although he was very pleased with it, I took one look at the box after it was delivered and went ""huh?"" It's much smaller than it appears and its made with Styrofoam! Very reminiscent of a junior high art class project. I just don't think it's worth the money. Plus, I seen a television ad for this exact model plus a landing pad for $10 bucks less than I paid here."
4,Cool,Cool toy for the price. Recomend for adult or teanager. Breaks fairly easily but still a lot of fun for the price. The cats go nuts and think its a bird. The dog also gets a little excited too. Can only use indoors but thats not too bad.
4,Great low-cost RC flying toy,"We got this for my son's 7th birthday, since he's been interested in all things that fly for quite a while. We had previously tried an Air Hogs rocket, and loved it, and an Air Hogs airplane, and hated it. This helicopter was a very pleasant surprise. It's very cheap for an RC helicopter, so we had low expectations. It doesn't look or feel like much, but it flies great once you get the hang of it, and the controls are simple enough that a 7-year old can easily fly it. We love the fact that you can fly it indoors - our great room with a 20-foot ceiling makes an awesome fly zone! And even when it crashes (which it does, often), it doesn't get damaged. The only problem we've had is that hair and fuzz gets caught in the tail rotor, causing it not to rotate. When this happens, the helicopter still flies, but just spins out of control. Taking out the hair/fuzz made it work properly again."
3,fun....but easily broken,"i got this toy for christmas and i had loads of fun playing with it. but after about two months of use it gave out on me. This toy is made of styrafoam and is easily breakable. when charging, you plug it in to the side of the toy. but if you push too hard, it will break or damage the wires inside. my advice is: if your going to buy this toy, then be sure to be carefull with it."
3,Send 2 helis for the same channel!,"I bought this products, 2 of these, because I wanted to fly and compete with my mate, but the seller send both for the same Band/Channel!!! we lost part of our fun. It was not specified in the product details that the channel was fixed, the control supports multiple channels, and that's why I did not payed attention to the product colors, BTW there was no choice to select colors. Beware if you want to buy 2 of these for the sharing fun with friends, it may not work at all! Too bad. What's the purpose of having a multi-channel control if the heli comes with a fixed channel?"
3,Broke the first day,"bought this for my hubby for Christmas...he used it for a few minutes,then had to charge it because the battery only lasts for about 6 mins.So he did that off and on for a couple hours. The last time he wentto play with it, it hit the wall and broke. It should have comewith some replacement parts for the money... what a waste."
2,Battery Hog,"This product appears to be a bit of a battery hog. I went thru 2 sets of batteries in the same day. Each set (duracell alkaline) were good for 2 charges. Afterwards, any attempts to recharge resulted in in spinning and inability to get the helicopter airborne. Better invest in rechargeable batteries for this toy. Any body else have this problem?"
4,We loved this little toy,"We had so much fun with this toy. It's simple to use, just take it out of the box and start flying. It's tricky to get the thing to go where you want it, which is half the fun. Highly recommended toy, just be careful with it, it's made of foam and can get broken easily."
2,not as advertised,"When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting the best of the indoor helicopters. After I received it, I found the exact same product at target for $10 less. I forgave them, but then on Christmas day my dad open the air hogs heli and I opened a similar one from Brookstone. Let me tell you the air hogs heli was not very responsive, it would cut out, it did not hover very well and overall was not just much fun to play with. The helicopter I received from Brookstone, was very responsive, came with lots of extra parts and was very fun.All and all, I would not choose the air hogs heli and I would go with the one from Brookstone."
3,needs batteries,Works well. Medium control quality. The helicopter handset needs 6 AA batteries. Recharges from handset so delays play. For the money and the flying model experience it is well worth it.
3,Air hog havoc heli,"This helicopter is a lot better then other remote helicopters on the market. I've tried a few, but there still could be better engineering on Air Hog's part. The helicopter does not always want to fly straight no matter what you do to the helicopter to make it fly in a forward direction. I would not buy one again, unless there have been some improvements to the helicopter."
4,"Fun toy, Great for Beginners","This helicopter isn't the most maneuverable but it was very easy to use and very durable. The first few days we owned this, it crashed into most everything as we learned how to use it but it is still flying great. It's a lot of fun for kids and adults and a good beginning helicopter for those interested in the more complicated ones. We used this one to 'learn' on before we tried flying a more expensive one that we received as a gift. Very fun, very durable."
4,Great fun for all ages,"Length:: 0:25 MinsThis is a video of my 10 year old playing with the copter after about 10 minutes. She is now flying it all over the house and basement. The machines are a lot studier than what you think, and a lot of fun for all ages (I sneak in some time too)."
3,Air Hogs: Fun but trouble,"Just opened this Airhogs Havoc Heli (we also have one of the Stingers version that looks like a dragonfly). Both flew well and charged on day one. Day two, the Havoc heli stopped flying, and we broke two tail rotors on the Stinger heli. Ours came with two replacrment tail rotors so after some difficult (and delicate) pulling and prying, we got the new tail rotor on and were flying again. The main trouble was with the larger main rotor. You have to be careful when picking it up off the floor because once it starts to get loose, the heli just spins on the ground, but does not fly up. I was luckily able to gently put the main rotor back on, but I had to put a small bend in the driveshaft which helped hold the blade tight and was able to get flying again."
1,Doesn't last long and eats batteries like a cookie monster,"It's fun once you learn how to fly it. It doesn't break or crack when it hits the floor which is nice. We have 2 heli's. And both are having problems after 2 months. 1 won't lift off higher than 2 feet. Now it does not fully charge. Heli will only run for 2 minutes and then cuts off.. The second helicopter's lower propeller doesn't spin half the time. Also it won't lift off at all when both propellers are going. Not worth the money. Frankly if your kids are old enuf, you would be better off with a more reliable brand. As for batteries just go buy packs and packs b/c they just don't last with this product."
1,Keep Your Money,I bought this for my son it Lacks enough power to get off the ground more than a few inches.
3,"Pretty Good, but not worth $30","This is one of the most undurable R/C Helicopter I have ever used the support broke off in two days and I crashed about 10 times in very soft areas, I really don't reccomend anybody getting this it's really not worth the price. The heli battery is terrible it only holds charge for bout 10 minues on full charge, over tie after using it for a 1 wek or even 5 days you will notiec the charge of it will hold less and less. The only thing good about it is that it's REALLY easy to fly. Pretty much great for first timers but dosen't last long."
1,for an extra $7.72 you can buy a syma,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! for an extra $7.72 you can buy theSyma S107/S107G R/C Helicopter - BLUEFirst of all its only 2 channel meaning it goes up, down, forward, clockwise, and counterclockwise.The syma on the other hand is 3 channel meaning it goes up, down, forward, backward, clockwise, and counterclockwise, plus it has a gyro, making its flights a lot smoother."
3,flight of the non-navigator,"Great toy for playing around a large room, high ceiling house. I think 16' x 16' is just enough. Outdoors is okay too, just stay in radio contact. Very tough to steer, often watch the thing twirl and maneuver on its own. Very durable, doesn't break easily, but seems to have diminished ability to keep charge after a few runs (just mine?). Stays up and is a lot of fun... get different colors if you want to fly more than one plane at the same time. Same color = same radio frequency built in (A B or C)."
1,Short Lived Fun,"My son loved this toy and was able to easily maneuver the heloc with the remote control. However, the toy is only made from styrofoam and it broke from gentle banging after the second day. It was short lived fun and my son was very disappointed that it broke. I called the company and they were unwilling to sell me a replacement heloc."
4,Very fun toy,"It is a very fun toy, the bad thing is the 6 AA battery for the control and the very short time in the air, about 6 minutes, but in general you can have a great time playing with it."
2,"Fun, but broke",This helicopter was really fun to fly while it wasn't broken. One of the blades chipped and now won't lift. Haven't figured out yet if we can get a replacement blade or not. We've been busy with some other things and haven't had a chance yet to check.
2,didnt stand beyond a week,"we loved this at first, but then it just didnt fly..what we think is it has some hair stuck in the wings..nothing we can see though..cud have been sturdier"
1,Terrible Toy,"Do you want to buy this toy? Well don't!!!!! This toy is one of the worst toys I have ever had and I have had so many toys. It worked okay for a short amount of time. Then, all it did was spin out of control and then later it cooled down and didn't spin as crazily but it wouldn't stop spinning even when me and my mom kept hitting the trim button repeatedly. The same thing happened to my sister's helicopter and it is also a havoc helicopter. You also need to charge it for 20-30 miniutes, you need 6 AA batteries. SIX!!!!! You can also only play with it for 5-6 miniutes and then you must charge it again. I'm ten years old and I am very unhappy with this toy."
3,A lot of fun while it lasted!,"My 12 year old son had a great time with this Heli until Christmas night at my parents house. He was hovering the helicopter and my sisters little Demon 5 year old walked over and kicked it out of the air and then stomped on it. It does not fly now, but oh well. My son took it pretty good and we are looking locally for another one to replace it.My Sister has no clue how much of a little brat they have created. She told him NO a bunch of times and he just looked at her like she was speaking Chinese. I would assume that is because he has never heard the word NO before, and so it is like a foreign language to him.Bottom line...... My son learned a valuable lesson in that I think he will listen to me in the future when I warn him about bringing things to my parents house that he cares about... especially when my sister is there!"
5,"So easy to fly that even I, a Private Pilot, can fly it.","A word of advice. This may be a toy but it needs to be properly operated. Breakage is very easy with things that fly. The harder it crashes, the more it gets broke. I would consider it get great way to start training your future budding pilot. But then I'm just a crabby old man."
3,"A nice kids toy, but little more.","The Air Hog Havoc is a tiny toy, very lightweight, rather durable, made of foam plastic and controlled by an infrared light link (not radio control). The controls are rudimentary - collective (controls rotor speed rather than pitch), and cyclic (rotates the nose right and left, but omits forward/back except the bit linked to right/left motion). The result is a difficult to control craft that must be used indoors only (can't handle even light air currents) and not in bright light (interferes with the infrared controller). Fun, but for a former helicopter crewchief, disappointing in the lack of control that causes frequent crashes, and I can't imagine how many ""takes"" the TV ads needed to show aerobatics and maneuverability."
1,Junk,"I can think of many other better ways to spend 30 dollars than on this piece of garbage. The unit will not trim out, it is near impossible to fly because all it wants to do is auto rotate. (spin). If I had my father in laws reciept I'd take them back since he bought two for my kids and give his money back. Don't buy this product if you are looking for any sort of quality."
1,Havoc Heli sucks,"I picked up one of these POS devices, and it was horrible compared to a lower-priced Syma S107 helicopter. Symas fly with precision indoors, and are easy immediately. I think you need to pound down a few drinks to have a good time with a Havoc Heli, watching it run into the floor, walls and ceiling."
2,"Awesome concept, horrible quality.","I purchased these for 2 grown men at Christmas time. The kids were so excited to give them this awesome toy, but it was short lived. The second day one of the wings broke on one of the helicopters, and by the end of the following day, the other one wouldn't keep a charge or stop spinning in circles. I considered exchanging them, but I don't think I would have any different results, considering it was both of them that crashed and burned!"
1,Terrible piece of junk,"We bought three of these for Christmas--what a HUGE disappointment. They do not fly worth a darn. One never ever got off the ground. The two that did fly could not be steered or controlled. They were endlessly bashing into the ceiling and then plummeting to the floor. They seemed fun for a few minutes until it became apparent that it was not a question of learning how to fly them--they just stink! Within two hours, the blade on one helicopter broke off after hitting the wall. All three went back to the store.Skip this one and get the Syma S107Syma S107/S107G R/C Helicopter - Bluefor about the same price. It's a MUCH better helicopter. You can steer it, control how high it flies, maneuver around the house--even under tables and chairs. The Syma helicopter even lands rather than crashing! I can't say enough good things about the Syma helicopter."
3,A.H. Sharp Shooter is much better helicopter,"I first purchased this toy for my friends kids. One of the Heli's battery would not hold a charge and Spin master sent us a new one; so great customer service there.This is actually the Air Hogs Sport which is the same as the Heli, so say spin master, just an improved version as the body is make of plastic and not the cheesy Styrofoam.The Heli is not as stable and easy to fly as the Sharp Shooter but with a little practice it is manageable. the kids like the Sharp Shooter over the heli which they don't play with anymore.Save your money and get the Sharp Shooter version instead. You can get it at that ""Wally World"" cheaper than anywhere else."
1,Don't bother it breaks within hours!,"Its a total waste of money. The product quality is unacceptable!It breaks within two hours, the kids were disappointed and frustrated."
3,Flying fun - Inside!,"This indoor helicopter is a great concept, but the toy only lasted 5 days! I bought it for my Husband and he absolutely loved it! He flew it a few times a day for 3 days, and his flights would last around 10 minutes. Then, it stopped holding a charge. It would only fly for about 1-2 minutes, then gently fall to the ground. I tried changing all the batteries, but no luck. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be a very good present, as we had to send it back within a weeks time."
3,Fun but fragile,"My 12-year old wanted this for her birthday. It's alot of fun, and works great, but with much use you find it's a very delicate toy. She's had to glue or repair certain parts."
5,Wonderful,"We purchased this helicopter for my son's 13 birthday. He has thoroughly enjoyed it, and we have all marveled at what it can do. We purchased a different brand earlier, and it was broken in 5 minutes. This one has lasted."
5,Way too much fun!,"This is the best toy a boy could want (yes, an adult boy). The daughters and I are still playing and enjoying. I bought extra props, but they have not been needed."
1,Save your money,"This toy was less than 24 hours old when the battery wouldn't recharge, so the helicopter would not fly. Unfortunately for me, i had thrown out the box because it was my recycle day otherewise i would have shipped it back the day after it arrived."
1,"Sorry, but this product is worthless...","Unfortunately, the price should be $0. Reason: It is designed for kids, but when kids use it, it is not mechanically designed to survive the first day of use. Therefore, the joy when it's put in service is turned on its ear as your child (10 in my case) spends a bit of time with the product. It's a sharp looking product, perhaps it belongs behind a plexiglass box - admire but do not touch! Regards."
1,I Do Not Like Air Hogs,Doesn't trim well. Does not recover easily from any disturbance. Doesn't hover at all. Steering did not work at all well. [...].
1,"poor electric contact, even worse warranty","Bought one of these for my son (12 years old) before Christmas. He was excited and was extremely careful with it. He likes to collect toys, so after playing with it on 3 or 4 occasions he put it back in the box and onto his toy shelf. About 2 months later he took it out to play and it would not charge. The connection light (between helicopter and controller) doesn't light. There was no damage to the plane or controller and we followed all instructions to the letter. When I called the company in Canada the first week of April they told me the warranty was up and that I could buy a new plane (without controller) for $[...] and it would ship when it became available. I am extremely dissatisfied with the durability of this item. Non-functional after 1 hour of total play??? Ridiculous."
1,Not worth the money,sorry-but this is definitely not worth the price of $ 40 !!!Takes a lot of adjustment-then time to cool the Batteries after flying-then charging time-then ONLY 5 minutes of playtime-no fun for kids at all. I would NOT recommend this product!
2,Falls apart,"My son is 8. Loved this toy...must make sure it is charged before using.Problem is ,it is for indoor use and we live in an NYC apt. and this beautiful and delicate helicopter, strongly resembling a dragon fly and all it's beautiful gracefulness as it flies....was not tough enough to with stand the confined space and finally made it's way into a torcheire lamp, burned part of one wing, still worked even so and then.....poof....it just fell apart one day. The extra propeller included, no longer worked when attached as something obviously happened to the unit itself. If you have a large playroom for your kids....fabulous and mesmerising gift. New York apartment....not going to last for long."
3,Airhogs Helicopter,"Pros: Light,easy to operate ""in the ground"" :-)Cons: It did not fly,did not enjoy, sort of factory defectNext time buy it in the store so that u can check it b4 buying it."
1,Disappointed Aunt,Terrible. I bought this for my 6 year old niece for her birthday. It was very flimsy and never worked from day one. Do NOT waste your money on this.
5,Havoc Heli,"I bought these for my nephews for Christmas. They loved them and enjoyed playing with them. Despite their small size, they are very durable."
3,Great toy,"If we could find a space large enough to try this....It has been raining for days (no complaint as we need rain)....My husband has tried it in our living room and kitchen.....both spaces are large enough. The only problem is our TV goes off!! The radio control interferes with the TV, so the TV has to be reset. Otherwise, it is a great toy for my husband during the winter months!"
5,Loved It,I purchased 2 Air Hogs Havoc Helies and had them shipped to my son and 9 year old grandson for Christmas. They arrived promptly and work great. This was a great father and son gift.
1,Terrible.,This helicopter was impossible to control. Not even the adults could make it work with practice. The body fell apart from all the crashing. I would never buy this again.
3,Could use better materials,"Spinmaster Air Hogs Havoc Heli (Colors May Vary)We bought this remote heli as a gift. Our first impression was that the product is not made of plastic nor resing or metal as most toys are today. Rather is is styrofoam, which makes it a bit flimsy and poor. We enjoyed making it fly although rechargable AA batteries are highly recommended as these units are charged from the controller and will not last more than a few hours of play. Do not use outside."
2,Too much trouble!,"Getting this little thing controllable takes a lot of trial and error, which really takes the fun out of trying to fly it around a room. It is durable, but, it has to be. Average time before crash in any room is 5 seconds. Instructions on control are sketchy so it's just trial and error. Up and down control is great...forget direction or eliminating spinning. You will lose weight or ""hurt your back"" getting up and down to retrieve it. Spend another ten bucks on something more stable and controllable!Mike R, FL"
4,Very cool but has it's weak points,"I just got this for Easter and let my tell you this is not just for Kids. My dad loves IT!!! It is very very easy to fly but the Min age us 8 ,I think that it should be given to a kid around 9-12 for the min age. The one issues with it is 1.The back spiner break's easly ,2. The Foam that they use has the little balls he you can rip off of it, so it brake's more easly. Buy this item today , you won't be sad."
2,Get a real Toy,For the around the SAME price you can get a real 3ch RC (NOT IR) Model and actually fly it and do something interesting with it.I bought a Dragonfly and haul a wireless video camera on it.Whether the real Silverlit or one of the illegal knockoffs they are not really worth the money.
1,Lasted 4 Days,"I gave this to my great nephew as a reward. Well, it lasted 4 days and then parts started falling off. I'm returning it for a refund and not having it replaced. I think products should perform as advertised and this one certainly does not. If there were zero stars, this product would get it hands down."
2,Fun but could be better,"We purchased the Air Hogs helicopter after we saw a commercial for it. The smaller size and manauverability are what got my attention. I've had it for a few weeks now and am somewhat disappointed. It is not nearly as manauverable as I thought it would be, even with the small nose weights added. It basically just goes up and hovers around eradically. Having operated the Bladerunner helicopter, I was used to being able to land it where ever I wanted and having full control. I would consider this an uncontrolled toy and not a true remote control."
1,BIG disappointment,"The landing gear fell off as we took it out of the box. We carefully read the instructions, which wasn't easy because they read like they've been poorly translated from Japanese. Charging worked, but that was it. Mostly the helicopter just sat on the floor and spun. Following the instructions (we think), we tried the trim controls on the remote, but we might as well have been pressing the room's light switch for all the good it did. We tried trimming the tail according to the instructions, and the tail promptly broke. Piece of crap! Do not buy!"
5,Buy this now,"At first this thing seems to just go up and down. After you learn to hover you will see that leveling off will result in forward movement if held level and straight. Added weight to the front is a must. The included sticker weights aren't enough. Get a thumb tack (use one that looks like a pawn) and place at the bottom front of the nose. It helps to super glue this into place once you find the sweet spot. Save your feet. Some people will suggest to use a push pin at the front. If you do, DO NOT PUSH the pin all the way. You will puncture the battery. This will kill your heli. As for controls, once it is in the air slight movements will give the best results."
2,Spinmaster Helicopters,"This is a great toy that my son has enjoyed, but beware...it's not very durable! I also found that it was much cheaper (even at the height of Christmas shopping frenzy!) than I purchased here for. And, watch out...if you are looking for laser game, these are not them!"
3,Fun and flimsy,"Really lots of fun, especially when it got tangled in Mom's hair. It was OK though because Dad cut it out. It crashed several times, and destroyed itself on the stairs. But what fun while it lasted."
2,Fun but disappointed,"Picked up one of these for my son, it was the first thing on his very short Christmas list. He was so excited for about the first 15 minutes until it stopped working. It kept spinning in circles and at first we thought it was just his aviation abilities, then we realized the back propeller thing had quit working. I'm sending it back and hoping for a replacement. It seemed like a really neat toy for the short time it worked."
4,Greatest Cat Toy Ever,"This helicopter is one the funnest toys I have ever played with.I get much enjoyment watching my cats try(and many times succeed) to swat it from the sky.Considering the cats smack it around,it pretty solid.In the two weeks I have had it,I have only had to replace one tail rotor(it comes with 2 spares).It definitely takes a certain touch to fly it without ramming walls,but considering how inexpensive it is,you wouldnt feel guilty about it as you might with a more expensive model.The air currents(including the A\C) certainly affects the flight patterns,so it's not so good for outside play,but I still recommended it.Great for ages 8 to 80."
4,colors and channels do not vary,We bought 3 of the Havoc Heli counting on getting at least 2 different colors and 2 different channels...but no. We received 3 identical ones. Now we can only fly one of them at a time because they are all the same channel.
2,Havoc Heli that isn't worth it!,Had great fun with the helicopter for one hour. The motor lost power over the hour and eventually couldn't get air. Charging or new batteries weren't the issue. A very poor use of our money.
1,Not worth your money,"Now i know what your thinking air hogs havoc heli's look so good in the commercial so i think i might get one,DON'T! My son got this toy for his birthday and loved it. But when we first tryed it out we didnt have any control of it it would go in the air and start spinning in circles and ultimitly crash. Now eventualy the back propeller got a hair stuck in it and that was the end of air hogs. If you want one of these kinds of toys go with wowwee my sone got the starblade and loves it."
4,Small but Mighty,"The review below was written by my 13 year old son.This is a great remote controlled helicopter! My only concern is that the first one I bought was a defective. I flew it twice and the top rotor snapped right off. But then I returned it and got another and this one is working perfectly fine.For those of you who live in a place with high altitude such as 7000 ft. just to take a little weight off your shoulders, it will work perfectly fine.I do not suggest that you buy this for very small kids. They must be gentle because this helicopter certainly is not indestructible even though it is tough for a little helicopter.This is a great helicopter and for those of you who want a low cost flying R/C this is perfect! Enjoy!It may be cheaper from stores near you.P.S You probably will need a reasonably large space to fly it in, like a living room."
4,Great little toy!!,"I bought these helicopters for my husband, son, & dad, for Christmas. They all enjoyed playing with them, however, they were a little hard to control. But they are fairly durable and for the price you can't beat it!! If you want a great remote helicopter you're going to have to spend significantly more. Like over [...]."
3,OVER-COMPRESSED BOOTLEG FOOTAGE!,"THIS DVD IS FOR DIE HARD YNGWIE FANS ONLY. WHILE IT HAS GREAT PERFORMANCES, THE VIDEO AND SOUND QUALITY IS MOSTLY POOR. THE MUSIC IS OVER TWO HOURS AND HIGHLY COMPRESSED TO FIT ON A STANDARD SINGLE LAYER DVD. IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USING A DUAL LAYER DVD LIKE 99% OF RELEASED DVD'S."
3,Not worth the $$'s in my opinion...,"I've been a HUGE fan of Yngwie since the late 80's, but this dvd is really disappointing and not worth the price in my opinion. It is bootleg quality but also lacks bootleg footage that could have been included (Milwaukee Summerfest '85, Legend Valley Ohio '86, 1981 rehearsals, Tokyo '86, Osaka 1992, and many others). Even the new interview footage isn't 2010 quality! I don't understand how officially released VHS gems like Tokyo '85, Leningrad '89, and his Videos collection still remain unavailable in the USA on DVD, but stuff like this gets issued!?!"
3,Nice material,"This was a nice costume as far as the material goes, but it really didn't look like a lion, and was structured in a way it was hard to get on. Price was good though."
2,Okay for rubber cleats,This rubber doesn't hold up if you are using metal cleats. We had to replace the pitching rubber after one day of use.
2,Doesn't fit my phone.,"I ordered this battery and cover based on the description which listed my phone model (T-Mobile Motorola Razr V3), but when it came I found that the battery fits, but the cover does not. I attempted to resolve this with the seller, but was told that it wasn't designed for my model. If that is the case, it should not be listed in the description. I don't have the time to continue to pursue this, so will just find a battery cover elsewhere, but I won't be using this vendor again."
3,Cute but fuzzy,"The rug is darling. Thick and colorful. However, within an hour my granddaughter (4 months old) was able to create a fist full of fuzz from her little feet -- let me explain. I put her stationery jumper on top of this rug so she would have a soft place for her feet to land when she jumped. Each time she jumps she creates a ball of fuzz. I hope it stops soon, but I have had the rug for about 4 weeks and it is still fuzzing up."
4,"Acoustic piano version of ""You Were Right""","For those of you seeking an acoustic, piano-based version of ""You Were Right"" like the one BDB played on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, this is the CD to get. The track goes a bit long near the end, and the audio quality could be better, but this softer, slower rendition is really beautiful and worth the price."
5,Seems accurate,The tool seems pretty accurate. Good to know where your at with your engine before pouring money into it. I purchased on for harbor freight which seems to be off about 10psi compared to this product. Also all the attachments can be screwed on together so you don't lose them. (which is common for me lol) Would recommend to others considering!
4,works,"Works on my Toyota 22R, not too difficult to thread, though it's all hand-tightening, seems like there's gotta be a better way."
3,OK for the price,"It worked fine, with the exception that the guage developed a 30psi offset (stuck on 30 at when no pressure applied). The is no apparent way to set the ""zero"", so I exchanged the unit."
3,..,Purchased this product mainly to do compression test on my Suzuki SV1000S. All sizes didn't fit as they were too big. Works perfectly for cars.
1,sheep are white and fluffy,"My name is david charles duell and i am 16 years of age. my birthday is the 5th of may and i live on elms road, in stratford upon avon. i live with my deranged lunatic of a mother in a small flat, and my room is the cupboard in the kitchen. my only friend is a small plate called tony, and a nice mug known as dillon. my only escape from my horrible life is when i get home and see my 2 favorite kitchen appliances, with whom i play various games including twister and cluedo, and i always lose. the story of my life really!!! h yes, your book is awful. i need proffesional help, i am on the brink of insanity, and if i lose my marbles who will care for my deranged mother??? help me please. END OF MESSAGE"
3,"Important story, self-important author","This desire to hang on to history and heritage is noble and necessary. Bravo to the author and his colleagues. There are things that can be expressed in Yiddish, that when translated, need twice as many English words to convey their meaning. Unfortunately, this book is incorrectly marketed as an adventure---we expect to encounter Indiana Jones! With so much built up anticipation, the reader is left with a ""hmmm"" instead of a ""WOW!"" at the end."
5,more than just the books,"Aaron Lansky tells us about a lot more than just his efforts (and those of his many, many supporters) to rescue Yiddish books. He interweaves his stories with a history of Yiddish language, culture, and literature. Although these brief history lessons are not nearly as entertaining as his anecdotes of traveling around the globe (although mostly to New York) to collect the books, put together they make for an engaging, even enlightening read."
4,Saving Yiddish Books,"Aaron Lansky has devoted his adult life to rescuing, collecting, cataloging, and re-distributing hundreds of thousand of books written in Yiddish. They rescued the books from abandoned libraries, dumpsters, and taken publishers' complete collection when the publisher closed their business doors. They also accepted the private libraries of elderly people who wanted the story of each book preserved as well as serving Lansky and his cadre of volunteers kugel.The book is funny, erudite, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. Lansky's style is very easy to read, and he draws you into his obsession one book at a time."
5,A must read!,I really loved this book filled with Heart and Soul. It made me laugh and cry. What wonderful work they have done!!!!!! My Hadassah book club love the book as well!
5,historical travel writing at its best,"This book is a joy for the armchair traveler. It takes you back to a place and a time, to a Turkish winter in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Burnaby's style is immediate, and compellingly readable. He lets you feel the mud, the cold, the mood of the times -- and the exotic east. It's great stuff. Crossing Anatolia by horseback in the winter, trying to track down rumors then circulating in Europe of anti-Armenian sentiment among the Turks, Burnaby finds the rumors to be baseless. But through every step of his wild goose chase, while we follow him through village after village, Burnaby describes in colorful detail the environment, and the people he meets. The first three-quarters of this book read like fiction, like a good, rollicking adventure story. It doesn't have a crisis near the end, like an adventure novel would, but Burnaby's story is all the better for being true."
4,Great Adventure Book,"Fred Burnaby did as much as possible, often using his intelligence over his admirable physical strength!A GOOD READ!This guy traveled all over Russia/Middle East/Africa/Turkey with tales you will be glad you read about!"
3,It kind of works,"Overall it is functional, but getting it setup gave me a few frustrations the first couple times. For some reason when I set the two countdown times, they tend to switch (1 becomes 2, etc). Overall it seems to work, but I just got it. For some reason I thought it was much bigger from the photo. It's a basic small plastic timer. Should work for what I need though probably a bit overpriced."
2,Not easy to use,Its not friendly user to many steps and poor design andI would not recommend to any of my friends.
4,Near perfect for home gyms and garage training.,"When I received my shipment we actually didn't even see the round timer at first, it was smaller than I had expected but hangs handily on the wall. You can set how many rounds, how long each round and how long each break between rounds, which works perfectly for mma/boxing/circuit training. The auto-off is nice post-workout, especially for home workouts, not having to worry about turning it off or wasting batteries as a result. It's simple once you take five minutes to figure the whole thing out, tho the directions kinda suck and the yellow up/down arrows are misleading as they don't function like they appear to, but the volumes completely controllable and gets plenty loud if you need to turn it up over music or anything, and the comparably priced Everlast and Title timers I've seen aren't really comparable."
1,Junk!,this thing is a piece of garbage. i followed the instructions step by step and after one use it stopped working. the intervals never worked.. the time was always wrong. i only bought this because my dog ate my gym boss timer. i should have just ordered a replacement.. or just payed the big bucks and bought a clock gone bad timer.
1,Dont Buy This,I bought this product based on reviews...after buying and now using the product I can say that it is not worth buying. I had GymBoss timer previously...and it is soooo much better. This timer works...but is useless. The bell is largely inaudible during a workout ..unless you do yoga. I don't. I box. The light is like a toy light...useless.. so unless you want to keep checking the (non backlit) clock...you wont know when to stop.Programming it is a breeze.But the Gymboss and other timers are at least as capable of interval and rest periods and have much louder sounds and or vibrate to alert you...
4,great timer,"Only complaint is that I wish the beep was louder. The settings make for easy adjusting for whatever interval you want, from tabata to whatever, it's all possible."
5,a must have for any aspiring tailor,"Although Poulin's book was written in the 50s, he has a very modern voice that is easier to understand than earlier books such as the Blue Book of Men's Tailoring. His passion for the work is evident in his instructions on how to do everything from press fabric to inserting the lining. The book takes you through a vest, trousers, skirts, and suit jacket from draft to finish. The explanations of the drafts can be a little spotty, but you will find that in any good tailoring book. Poulin's methods use traditional techniques and materials (some of which can be hard to find nowadays) but his advice is still priceless. Depending on the edition, there are varying degrees of information about women's suits, with the later editions having more. This is purely a construction book, written by a tailor, for aspiring tailors, and not about style or design. It is about creating a beautiful, well made garment."
3,A little disappointed,"I was expecting greater things from Contemporary Authors, a time honored publication. All the information seems to be correct, but most of it could be found for free with a quick Internet search. I feel as though I overpaid, even though it was only two bucks. I had to write a report on her for a graduate class I'm taking and thought I would get much richer information than what I did. Perhaps my expectations were too high. All in all it's not bad though.Sections included are:FamilyEducationHobbies and other interestsMembershipsAddressesProfessional employmentPublications""Sidelights"""
4,Proving the Promise,"I found Promise to be a enlightening book taking me through the Scriptures and showing just how the Messiah had been ""promised"" and how those prophecies were fulfilled. I like to read through this book every year before Easter."
2,"I hope this is the right book,","Due to the fact that it doesn't even say how many pages there are or when it was released or give any editorial reviews at this time, it might not be.If this is however the book about Christ's return and the proof of his existence:This was a terribly boring book even though the subject was interesting to me. There is some information that you can connect with the bible if you're into combing through the bible for things that may or may not make sense to you or even make you care much even it does. It was interesting but didn't strike me as having alot of substance. It's like he's just throwing opinions out at random, then trying to find a way for any part of the bible to sound like it comes close. I didn't care for it at all, and I don't think it is worth buying."
5,Absolutely superb investigative reporting!,"This book takes us back to the 1980's, the dark days of Oliver North's ""neat idea,"" Reagan's Freedom Fighters, and the crack cocaine explosion. The evidence is overwhelming that agencies of the U.S. government were complicit in the importation of cocaine, and Oliver North was even more deserving than I originally believed of a long-term stay in a prison cell (too bad Alcatraz is no longer a federal prison - it's where Ollie belongs!).We probably can never know the extent of CIA involvement as then U.S. Attorney General William French Smith exempted the CIA on behalf of then CIA Director William Casey from having to report illegal drug activities. If you don't have to report it, you don't have to keep records - therefore, there are no records and the Inspector General's report can truthfully say - ""We can find no records.""Thank you Gary Webb for writing this book. I am truly sorry this cost you your job at the San Jose Mercury News."
5,Dark Alliance,This book is outstanding!It's a shame that such a talented investigativejournalist had to lose his life because of it's content.
5,"A great read, and a great purchase","I was very interested in this product, and I was happy to find it at a reasonable price. The book arrived in perfect condition, and it has also turned out to be a great read. Exactly what I was looking for, thanks!"
5,Gary Webb is a great American,America is great because Americans are good. Gary Webb is a heroic journalist. His determination to tell this story is admirable. The research is meticulous...the conclusions undeniable.
1,Funny,"I read this for a class and find the fact that people believe this crackpot credible to be humorous. He briefly mentions the Boland amendment which made it illegal to help the Contras, which was a two sentence earmark thrown into the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983, it was seen as a dirty trick. He also spends much of his time making Blandon, Ross and other drug dealers look like decent human beings when in fact they were nothing but criminals; but you understand why he makes them out to be good guys when you realize that they are his primary sources. Let's not forget the gaps where there are absolutely no sources, sometimes up to 8 pages without a source. It is no wonder this fool was fired and attacked by his own peers for his lack of journalistic integrity; he had the journalistic integrity of Dan Rathers. It is a shame he took his own life, I would love nothing more than to watch this idiot try to defend this fictional garbage."
3,striptease,"Appreciated for its lengthy and detailed account of its American origins the book manages to dry out just where you thought it would be most interesting - the post war scene. The photography from this period is also dissapointing whereas the early imagery is very good.I found its international references strangely lacking. Occupied west Germany had a huge industry as did France and of course the famous Windmill Theatre of London could and should have been dealt with.Even Australia in the sixties especially had its lively clubs in the major centres (and even country shows), so this history missed the opportunity of presenting the universiality of stripptease, in this fairly dryly written history. In style this book is sadly missing the point of stripping!Lets hope a better history gets done someday."
2,A Lumpy Bump,I have to agree with the other reviewers who have said this book is cobbled together from too many other books on the subject. I saw too much emphasis on the history of modern dance (Ruth St. Denis?!?) and not enough on the history of the real strippers.
1,same old thing...,same photos and same words I have seen in every other burlesque book. It's all just filched from the 5-6 vintage burlesque books you can buy used.
4,Interesting perspective of hunting and living in Kenya,"Finn has produced a very interesting account of the years of life as a farmer and hunter in Kenya before legal hunting was outlawed. His recollections are not quite so colorful as those of Peter Capstick, though probably more truthful. They allow a prospective of the life of a professional hunter that is not commonly available.After you have read the rest, you owe it to yourself to read the best. Life is sometimes like that."
2,Letdown,"After the awsome BBC and Best Of releases, this Tribute was a total letdown. The two or three good tracks can't save this album. If you don't already have Come On Pilgrim, go buy that instead."
1,Why? What's the Point?,"yes, all the songs on this album are great but almost every band (except maybe two) play the pixies' songs exactly like the pixies. It seems to me that a good cover should take the song to another place, another level. I don't see the point in all these otherwise good artists copying the pixies verbatim."
2,"PIXIES Tribute, Where are our minds?....","Not bad as tributes go, but the source material is superior. Do yourself a favor,listen to Surfer Rosa and Doolittle. You'll soon realize they (the songs) don't need to be reinterpreted...Oh well"
5,It's rich in the geek rock sound.,"I'm just happy that there is something new from weezer. I was surprised that alot of the other bands I like are on this too. If you are a weezer fan, you'll love this."
4,pixies + mid=90's post punk = great CD,"wow...this is a great tribute CD. i mean, as far as tributes go. i was psyched out of my mind with the weezer track, but it wouldve been cool if radiohead had put something on it. overall really good. yay 4 nada surf and superdrag too!"
3,It's not that horrible,"Yes, it's not the pixies, and yea it doesnt have that ""feeling"" of the rawness of the pixies, but they're just covers. and you dont need to diss weezer and the other bands too. The album of course isnt a pixies album, some of the covers are painful, but its not that incredibly horrible either. I love Pixies, and also love Weezer. So thats my review, and chill."
3,My Velouria...,"Weezer's cover of Velouria is AWESOME, no one will ever convince me otherwise. Weezer took that song, broke it down a bit and made it theirs. In my opinion they made it better. When I listened to the song the first 3 times, I got goose bumps. The way they did the song in their own way was much more powerful to me than the Pixies original version of the song. I have listened to the original version of 'Velouria' by the Pixies and it doesn't groove with me the same as Weezer's version, not even close.In my opinion the two best songs on this CD (and the only ones that I care to listen to), are Velouria and Where's My Mind? The cover by Nada Surf was very well done and was a huge surprise I must say."
2,This is decent,"...I went into this CD not expecting much, since tributes are often poor representations of the bands to which the collections are dedicated. This mindset provided that I was not disappointed by this mostly bad compilation...The bad on this CD not only outnumbers the good, it outweighs the good..."
3,where is dave kendall when we need him?,"Gimme a break. The whole point of tributes is to for each band to make the song their own right?Weezers cover of Velouria is the most bland, uninspired thing I have ever heard in my life. Could it be because Weezer rips of the Pixies so much that they dont actually have a style of their own? Sadly, Superdrag fell into the same trap.At least Reel Big Fish, The Siren Six! and Teen Heros took a risk and made the songs interesting to me again. I've never busted a move to Gigantic before.Yes, yes we like the Promise Ring. And I La, La, Love WestonEve 6 annoys me. It's all the singers fault I'm afraid."
1,"Embarrassing ""tribute""","As a devout fan of the fervor and grit of the Pixies, I found this to be a limp-wristed, disgusting insult to the raw genius of the Pixies.Most ""interpretations"" attempt to be literal and sound as if they were played sitting down. Covers by Weezer, The Get-Up Kids, and Nada Surf were hardly noticeable.Hated it so much I destroyed it instead of reselling it. Why contaminate fellow Pixies fans with this garbage?"
1,bad follow up,high/low was a good cd but this cd is terrible. the songs sound stupid. don't get this cd.
4,Who are these bands?,I have to admit that I was a little dismayed when I saw who was contributing to this album. I've read numerous interviews with bands who list the Pixies as a major influence but they are conspicuously absent. I really expected Dave Grohl to put something on it. The Weezer song sounds great though.
2,WHo picked em?,"I very reluctantly bought this CD, and I only got it because of Weezer being on it. I'm completely in love with the Pixies, and completely in love with Weezer. Unfortunately, all the other bands suck. THerre are some interesting versions of thier songs (Wave of Mutilation, The Holiday Song, and even Nada Surf doing Where is my mind), but the only reason ANY of these stand up is because of the Pixies song writing. All of the bands just plain suck. I'm hoping the less major label Pixies Tribute coming out will be better. These bands are just crap. Some of them (Reel Big Fish mainly) seem to be making fun of the songs even, not paying tribute. QAnd many of the others are just people playing them exactly how they originally were, but just sung slightly different."
2,Not as good as the real thing,"Ugh, that Weezer cover is bad. The original is such a powerful song, and Weezer just makes it sound flat.Most of the other covers lack the energy of the real Pixies. Get the 2CD Pixies compilation Death to the Pixies instead."
4,a decent disc that will grow on you,"so hey..its a cover album. get over it before you drop your 13 bucks. its more of a celebration of a great band that some weird reinvention of it. the track list worries me at times (esp. since jimmy eat world didn't end up on it), but suprisingly most of the bands come through with pretty good covers (weezer, nada surf, and sense field are the standouts that make this disc worth buying). easily the most listened to record of late summer.DNA"
1,debasing the legacy,"i will admit to not having heard the entire CD, but the very concept of marginal talents (like weezer, nada surf and eve 6) recording pixies songs for some misbegotten tribute is anathema to me. it's like being staked over a red ant hill. excruciating. there are literally hundreds of superior bands that have also cited the pixies as an influence. this label is reducing transcendent songs to little pop nuggets for weezer fans.it makes me want to smash my head on the punk rock."
1,Don't WASTE your money!,"Aaagghh! The Pixies wrote incredibly intelligent and surreal music. Here we have a collection of the current ""top 40"" alternative bands to cover one of the greatest bands (Pixies) of all time. I could NOT find one decent cover on this CD. This stuff is horrible. I highly suggest you find yourself a guitar and do your own cover because it couldn't possibly be worse than this! - I'm so bummed out."
3,Here comes your tribute.,"This collection of Pixies covers reminds me of most any other tribute-type album. It's decent, and alot of the bands do a good job. Sure they don't compare for the most part, but it's somewhat nice to hear songs you know well given a new spin. Mostly I'd say this is a must for the fanatic. However, LIKE most every tribute album I've ever heard, it just makes you want to listen to the real thing. So why not?"
1,Cheap.,Cheap fabric as this is not applique. It twists a lot in the wind and color fades. I do like the graphics though.
3,disapointed,"My daughter wanted this toy because she thought it sang the theme song "" If I never come home I'll become a king"" not the all I wanna do is make him laugh and he only sings one song very disapointed that song is getting very old very quick"
1,Journey to Rip-Off Alot,"This bear has no educational vallue. It is annoying, too! It just sings ""all I wanna do is make 'em laugh"" !! I have a 3,4,10,12,45, and 59 year old relation, and they all HATE it. The only good thing is it's fairly durable, but we never play with it, so I can see why.(hint: if you can't get it to shut up, punch it's stomach.)"
1,Don't waste your time,"I have loved every contemporary romance Catherine Anderson has written so I usually trust her books as being good on sight, however, this book was not deserving of that trust. It dragged on for page after page after page with the same discussion over this womens mountain sized insecurties. Get over it already! and move on with the story, the romance please. The best and most romantic part of this book was the end. Why because it was the END and there was finally some romance."
3,Pretty good but sometimes a little annoying,"This book was well written and had a pretty good plot but I got a little sick of reading about all the insecurities the heroin felt all the time and how placating the hero had to be. I also didn't quite understand why the hero fell for Molly. Sure she had a good heart, but she was pretty darned annoying and went off the deep end a couple times. And I definately did not want to read about how much the heroin's cellulite (yes this word was used in the book) turned our cowboy hero on!!! Yuck (I personally found this part a little unbelievable). I enjoyed reading it, despite all that. I wouldn't try to deter anyone from reading it, but i wouldn't recommend either."
5,Great read.,"I always enjoy Catherine Anderson, she has the guy chases girl, girl wants to be caught, girl gets caught. Everyone lives happily ever after. Just enough sex that wants more of the same people in other stories."
2,DISAPPOINTING -,"- I usually enjoy Catherine Anderson's warm style of writing, but this story spent too much time on Molly's sick, violent, evil, verbally abusive ex-husband and not enough on the attraction between Molly and Jake. Don't we hear enough about violence on the daily News?? I want to get away from it in a romance novel. The romance aspect kept getting lost!! I also got a little tired reading about how appealing an overweight - plump woman was to the hero. It seemed to me instead of Molly just worrying about her ""Jiggle"" she could have tried to do something about it... exercise - firm up, etc. she began to sound like a real wimp ."
1,Sweet Nothings,"Well, I bought this book last year, January I think. Catherine Anderson has been coming out with one new book a year so I just bought it assuming it was her newest. Well, apparently she has started re-releasing her old books like Nora Roberts has been doing. Buyer beware. Make sure the plot doesn't seem too familiar. I had already read the book, probably in 2002. It wasn't that great then and now I'm out the money I spent on the new version. It doesn't indicate on this website that it is a re-release. New cover art and a January 2007 release date. I work hard for my money and hate to waste it on a book I've already read. I'll think twice before I buy another Catherine Anderson book."
4,Decent But Not Great,"I found this book to be fairly well written and was particularly captivated by his love for her even though she was less than perfect. Unfortunately, there was some redundancy and parts of the the plot line were old and cliche."
5,Wish I'd bought it sooner,"Spectral Analysis and Its Applications is an excellent source for professionals with intermediate time-series statistics skills. It clearly outlines and demonstrates the methods necessary to carry out sound spectral analysis of time-series data and how to use this data for modelling purposes. It is also a great aid and reference for anyone who needs the means to triumph over inexperience and under-education in time-series debates. Four years out of graduate school, I need this book again; I wish I'd bought it sooner."
4,"Great for developing ""teenager-proof"" rules","As a professional therapist, I have used the material in this book to help families with out-of-control teenagers develop ""teenager-proof"" rules. Teenagers are particularly good at finding loopholes and exceptions to rules developed by adults. Munger teaches the reader how to come up with very specific rules and consequences, so that there is no room for arguments about ""what ifs"". He also provides a very nice section about ways to improve communication between the home and the school by creating a daily report card that is easily used by teachers without overburdening them. The only short coming of the book is that its scope is very limited, but it does a great job of thoroughly covering these selected topics."
4,rapidly going out of print,"According to the Merge website, this one is sold out. So there are no more ""on the way."" A shame, too -- this is an excellent compilation with a number of rare tracks (Neutral Milk Hotel, Magnetic Fields, etc.).I'm still celebrating this label's 10th anniversary six years later!"
4,Favorite Artist from Merge,"This album features some of the best performers on the merge label and gives a great sample of what they do. If you like two or three artists, buy it to sample the other people and you;ll wind up buying their albums too. Great compilation - not a bad song in the set."
2,Cone size too large,"There are four silicon rubber rings (small, medium, large, and extra large) in the kit, and a plastic cone to facilitate the placement of the rubber ring over the penis. The cone in the kit is sized for used with the extra large ring. Since my size is medium, the kit is useless to me. The kit should come with different plastic cone sizes so that people with less than extra large penis sizes can enjoy the benefit it brings."
1,75% Useless,"I only have one penis, not four (!) and being on the small size of average only the small ring works for me, so the other three sizes are useless to me. It is beyond me why they market this product this way. Very shabby."
3,Strays from main premise,"The book is well written and documented. Unfortunately the author uses the last third of the book to discuss the value of honesty, using long discussions based upon Augustine and Lord Acton. The book's initail premise of the Papacy creating a system of deception is dropped until the closing paragraphs."
1,Poor Effort by Wills,"Wills really dropped the ball on this one.Wills seems to argue logically most of the time, but never seems to be able to really put together a coherent argument. Wills doesn't seem to even understand the concepts of the church he supposedly ""exposes"".So Catholics make mistakes? So what?! Every single member of every other religion also makes mistakes; The Pope goes to confession like any other human being, and Wills doesn't seem to get it. The Pope does not speak infallibly every time he opens his mouth, and those who understand the concept understand they are free to have a voice of their own.In the end, this is a poor effort by Wills... try one of his other books."
1,"Polemics, Not Scholarship","Readers of Papal Sin should be aware that, although the book bears a physical resemblance to a work of scholarship, it's mere angry polemics. Wills consistently ignores serious authors who argue--and, often, demonstrate--theses that contradict him. The treatment of matters like Vatican Council I and the Humanae Vitae debate will not impress anyone familiar with the literature on these topics. A pity."
1,Garry Wills' Book: A Structure in Deceit,"This book is nothing but an angry book about the Catholic Church. Just what religion does Garry Wills see as evolving from this effort? He doesn't believe in priests, doesn't believe in the Real Presence, advocates abortion, amongst other things. This isn't even a book about Popes!If Garry Wills considers himself a ""Catholic"" I think he should read the Catechism of the Catholic Church and see exactly what it means to be Catholic.Garry Wills has no faith in God. I don't even believe he believes there IS a God."
1,Structures of Willsian Deceit,"This work is not a scholarly look at the papacy. It is a tantrum with footnotes by an anti-Catholic Catholic. While cooing how much he loves the Church, he systematically denies the most basic Catholic doctrines on Christ, Mary, and the Church. His rage know no bounds. He attacks the canonization of Edith Stein, claiming her death had nothing to do with her being a Catholic. In fact, she was killed because she was both Catholic and Jewish; like other Catholics of Jewish descent, she was sent to Auschwitz after the Dutch bishops denounced the Nazis from the pulpit. He claims that the majority of bishops of Vatican II supported contraception; in fact, they explicitly criticized contraception in Gaudium et Spes. He can't even get his facts straight on noncontroversial issues. Where does one find the infancy narrative in Mark? A sad piece of self-hatred, but his masters at New York Review of Books are surely delighted."
1,Papal Sin,"If you are a Catholic hater, and want something to fuel your hate, this is the book for you. But, if you are interested in truth, at least get a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and better yet, in addition, read anything by a brilliant, faithful Catholic mind, such as Scott Hahn, Peter Kreeft, Patrick Madrid, or David Currie."
1,Totally Misleading,"I was terribly disappointed with the content of this book. The author presents his ""theories"" as factual historical information. It seems to me that he wrote this book simply out of spite for the Catholic Church. Any scholar who is familiar with the history of western civilization and the Catholic Church's hierarchy knows these stories Wills presents, to be totally false. Several examples he gives in the book are completely fictional and give a powerful weapon against Catholics, if only his stories were fact instead of fiction. This book is a complete waste of ones time if they are looking to learn about the history of the papacy or the Catholic Church. Look elsewhere!"
2,Church of Gary Wills?,"If Wills stuck to the point that power, including papal power is subject to abuse, few sincere people would be able to take issue with him. The problem is that he tries to sell the reader on a different vision of the Church, the Church of Gary Wills et. al. and he does this with all the zeal of a televangelist. No Roman Catholic, progressive or traditional would recognize Wills' new (or ""reformed"" to give him his due) Church. It would be a church without Sacraments as we understand them today, without teachings grounded in absolute truth, and where conceivably women priest may avail themselves of abortion. It is ironic how Wills' in ""Necessary Evil"" almost scolds us for not trusting big government, now cautions us against the Church structure. I don't think the Catholic Church needs to hide from its failures, both past and present and with John Paul II we need to seek forgiveness, but to ask us not to be Catholic is beyond what should be expected from us."
5,Provocative but Excellent,"I won't waste space here to repeat what the critics and admirers have stated here about Wills' book. Bottom line is that it is a thoughtful, mature and indeed spiritual book that takes a fresh look at the Roman Catholic Church. While sometimes a bit too arcane for me, I am nonetheless familiar with the wide spectrum of views of loyal Roman Catholic theologians on matters of faith and morals, and Wills brings home that reality. This might be a surprise to some who think Catholicism is monolithic in its thinking."
1,Embarrassingly bad writing,"This is poorly researched, written and edited. Names and dates are confused, sources misquoted, opponents badly misrepresented. I didn't know Wills had this sort of ill-tempered myopia, but that's what often happens when you turn against your own religious tradition."
1,Biased and unfair,"The book is a simple bash the catholic church book by someone who disagree's with the church's teachings on a variety of issues . It points out sins of bad popes and it simply makes some other stuff up . It doesn't give a fair look at all the pope's in history especially the present one . If you already hate the catholic church and it's teachings this is for you , however if you want only the facts and not biased propoganda then don't waste your time or money ."
1,Deceit,If there is any deceit in the Catholic church it is on the part of Mr. Wills. It used to be that bigotry came from without now it comes from within. Mr. Wills is no longer Catholic and has no business receiving the sacraments. He wouldn't get them in my parish. If you want to know the truth about the Catholic church this is NOT the book for you.
1,High Kitch,"Empty-headed petulence. This book more than anything is a fascinating and highly amusing portrait of the liberal-catholic mind at the end of the 20th century.To call Mr. Wills smug or the book bad is meaningless. It is pure Wills. And unfortunatley, the show must go on. The book is simply high kitch. Mr. Wills cannot even explain why he remains a Catholic.A sadly mindless, witless piece of work that reads as if it was cobbled together in a few hours."
1,New Age Religion,A book about the New Age Spirituality and direct from Yale University. These are the same old thoughts half truths emerging from the global village. Do not waste your money!!
5,An important book,"Catholic doesn't have to equal anti-intellectual. But, as Wills shows, the intellectual dishonesty of the modern papacy has fostered an environment where the one requirement for being Catholic is one's complete submission to the Pope. One's love for God, for neighbor, and for Truth all seem to take a back seat to subservience to another human being. The Pope=the Church=God? It has not always been this way, says Wills. In fact, recognition of the pope as human, capable of error, has been more the rule than the exception throughout the history of the Church. It is only over the past two centuries that this notion of absolute, inerrant authority has been developed. Papal Sin is not at all an anti-Catholic book-in the end Wills' clear vision is probably the best thing that could have happened to Catholicism."
4,"Polemical, yes -- but very good nevertheless.","Some people have described Wills as a ""liberal"" Catholic. I hardly think so. He is merely honest and intelligent, which sets him apart from the vast majority of conservatives in the Church today.For the most part, I admired the book. Wills deftly dismantles the preposterous arguments put forth by the Vatican to buttress erroneous teachings in the interest of maintaining this ridiculous charade of infallibility. He writes very clearly, and his sources are credible and well-documented.I find it amusing how so many reactionaries have dismissed this book as little more than angry polemics in reviews that are even angrier and more polemical. I suppose having your security blanket taken away from you can be upsetting."
1,Pope Gary?,"I found this book too shallow and too predictable to finish. This is yet another in a long line of books bashing the Church, usually written by cultural Catholics who lack the humility to truly examine their faith. Whatever spritit is moving Mr. Wills, I doubt it is a holy one. If you are looking for substance, look elsewhere."
1,What a long strange trip it's been...,"Over 35 years ago, Garry Wills wrote ""Politics and Catholic Freedom,"" and I respected him for it, even though I disagreed with much of what he had to say. But ""Papal Sin"" is different. It reads more like an intellectual tirade. It covers much of the same ground, but in a notably slipshod manner. In the end, I learned more about the author and his new politically correct dogmatic beliefs, than the subject itself. Too bad.Where is the old Wills? Or is THIS the ""OLD"" Wills? Too tired to proofread. Too close to retirement to bother with careful argumentation. Northwestern University deserves better scholarship than this from its professors. And so do we."
2,Papal Confusion,The convoluted series of essays by Wills really misses the point. The inherent hierarchy of guilt created by the Church is ignored and philosophical gibberish invades our logic. A tough read with little enlightenment. Don't waste your time or money.
1,The Klan does it better,At least the Klan doesn't pretend to be intellectual when it is crudely anti-Catholic. The usual haters of the Church and morality will love this.
1,A counterfeit by any other name ...,"By exposing their more than obvious apostasies of the past, can the Roman Catholic church become a new and improved 3-dollar bill?"
2,Why This Book?,"What was the whole point of writing a book just to make people feel bad about their Church? ""Papal Sin""? Come on, this book is not only totally biased, but it seems to bare no point, as Wills doesn't say that Papacy is evil or anything, he does say it has its mistakes though. But doesn't every religion have its mistakes?"
1,same old rhetoric,Same old silly agruments. We have heard it all before. I can't imagine why anyone would bother to write such silliness. I did not think that Wills carried around so much psychic debris...including anger and guilt...but it is obvious that he does...big time! Don't bother to read this book. Instead do some that would be more constructive...like shine your shoes.
1,Why did it take him so long?,"As I write, somewhere on this planet a Christian is being murdered for the crime of being a Christian, as hundreds are every single day. Under those circumstances, Papal Sins is not a clever polemic, not a timely critique, nor a first-rate piece of work (Wills has never writtena nything first-rate; a piece of work cannot rise above the level of its source). It is, quite simply, a sin.Wills might want to think about that a bit before he next faces an altar."
4,Useful Addition for Small Households,"The EO1251 is particularly useful for 1-2 person households, as it is a terrific little oven and an adequate toaster. I can't give it 5 stars until the designers improve the setting knobs, which are stiff and provide too small a finger grip for turning, and add a second rack to provide more placement options. To get the most reliable toast results, one needs first to warmed up the toaster settings. While the Cuisinart convection oven gets the higher ratings, some users I know have complained of the need to vet the equipment thoroughly, as it gives off an unpleasant chemical smell on initial usages. Fortunately, the DeLonghi has no such drawback. I also appreciate the simplicity of its settings; it's easier just to turn a knob in the morning than have to face the Cuisinart's digital pad."
1,Delonghi = defective by design,"We had a rude awaking today, our Delonghi toaster was on fire. I will never again buy any Delonghi product. The defective design is in the toast switch. It is mechanical. When it finishes toasting, it sometimes continues to the ""Always On"" position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast: very, very hot. We literally had a house full of smoke & a toaster full of flames. These Delonghi toasters need to be recalled. You were warned.Funny thing is, Delonghi makes an attractive product.Sad thing is, they can cost you your house or worse."
2,"Mediocre performer, did not last","Purchased this from Amazon in Dec. of 2005. Good looks, good control layout. Plenty of racks and such. Shape does accommodate a pizza perfectly.Problem areas: Thermostat is wildly inaccurate by about 20* too low. Convection fan causes a hot spot in the back of the oven, so it actually increases the chance of burning something. Adequate for minor toasting and baking chores, but no more than that - and certainly no faster than anything else out there.After 15 months of regular but no heavy use, it just died with no warning.Not a recommended purchase unless you also get the extended warranty, but even then, it's a matter of whether one can tolerate the operational issues and problems noted above."
1,Died after six weeks,"I ordered this oven in mid-November, and it worked beautifully for six weeks -- made evenly-browned toast and heated frozen foods quickly. Then, suddenly, after six weeks, the unit completely died. Just wouldn't turn on anymore. I called the company, and was told I would have to take it to a DeLonghi service center, but there aren't any in Manhattan -- I would have to travel quite a distance to get it repaired. Given this turn of events, I cannot recommend this product -- and for anyone living in Manhattan, I wouldn't recommend any DeLonghi products!"
1,this has broken down in just a few weeks after purchase,"The DeLonghi E!1251 oven/toaster is lovely and I love it but it never works for long. I've been through two, the last one having broken down today, one month after purchase. It just shuts down, no explanation. And I can't find anyone here in Manhattan who can repair it. Why should it do this? I buy it and then I toast and bake and enjoy it and then - whoosh! It stops working.Any suggestions? Can I get a refund, or at least someone to help pay for the repair? By accident, you guys sent me two last month and I returned the second, unused one. I was going to keep it, figuring this would happen but I didn't want to spook it so I sent it back.HELP!!!!"
3,Worked fine.. while it worked.,"I'm not sure the life span of your average toaster oven, but this one hung in there for 5.5 years of daily use. It reheated pizza well and cooked things like frozen french fries & chicken tenders a bit quicker than the regular oven. I wish it had lasted a bit longer, but while it lived, it did its job well."
3,"Nice toaster, died after 23 months","it was nice while it worked, toasted well enough, cooked chicken, corn bread, pizza muffins, etc. mysteriously gave up the ghost (but fortunately had cooked the chicken just enough that it didn't ruin dinner). We don't overuse our appliances, so 23 months is disappointing. Bought a Cuisinart replacement today that has a 3 yr warranty, so hopefully that'll work longer."
1,worked well until the knobs broke...,"just a couple of months in, the on-off dial quit working and the oven would no longer turn on. BLAH! Too bad, because the size and shape of the oven was very convenient and it worked quite well for our purposes. But what's the point of making a good product and then cheaping out on the most critical component!"
2,Reheated pizza pretty well... then it died,"We didn't really use this very often, mostly for reheating pizza. I never found it to be good for toast as it took forever and toasted unevenly. But it came in handy now and then. However, two days ago I went to make some bagel pizzas for the kids and while the tick tick of the timer sounded, nothing else worked properly. I tried several outlets. Wasn't the issue. No lights and no heat.I usually read reviews before buying appliances. Either this was so new that the reviews weren't out yet or I bought on impulse. Either way, I'm disappointed. We've had this maybe 2 years...??I think I'll be checking out another brand for the next toaster oven."
2,loved it until it died on me,"bought mine from Bloomingdales for about $60 about 1.5 yrs ago. It stopped working on me last week. I don't know why.what i liked was the easy clean catch tray. the height had been less, it probably would have cooked toast faster. Think'll I""ll go back to black & Decker's $20 models when they come on sale again."
1,Worked great until it broke,I owned a DeLonghi Convection Oven for 15 years that work flawlessly until it gave out. I bought this in November 2008 to replace it and on April 2009 smoke started to billow out of the vents of the oven as the wiring shorted out and the house filled with smoke. Lucky I was standing nearby to unplug it and rush it outside the house. I am a huge DeLonghi fan and have owned and used their products for decades with excellent results. This is the first time that I have ever had a problem. I noticed that I am not the only one here that had the oven fail prematurely. Let's see how well DeLonghi takes care of my problem. I will post an update if that happens.
2,Was good while it lasted,This toaster oven worked great while it lasted which is less then three years! For the cost it didn't last as long as expected. The oven worked great and we used it a lot but one day it just stopped working. I would not buy another toaster/convection oven from Delonghi.
3,Don't expect to learn very much...,"While Lucock's beautifully illustrated book clearly marks him as a good naturalist and an excellent photographer the book falls far short of offering any real instruction (save flash photography) on the matter of nature photography technique. The book reads more as Lucock's personal log on trips to Turkey, Grand Canyon, etc. The book serves more as a cursory study on the natural history of his subjects rather than as a serious photographic instructional book. Too bad because his photos are spectacular and if only he had shared his ""thinking"" behind the shots the book would have been much more enjoyable.Lucock clearly is a master at close up photogaphy, making the photos themselves, worthy of buying the book. Do not expect to learn a lot though."
3,Asteroid,"I watched this movie on TV and it was seen in two parts. When I bought the movie, I noticed that there were some scenes cut out in the VHS. I think that they should have left them in. The scene was where the Dr and little boy come out of the house and are walking to the hospital and an old woman ask's for help; other wise the movie is great."
4,Sci Fi,"I seen this movie before & liked. Something that could really happen one day ( & lets hope it wont!) & not just a made up one.Full credits goes to the main lead actors. Well played & well made movie by the producer (s) directors & all, it shows what could happen should an Asteroid collide with Earth."
3,Could Have Been Better,"The theme of the movie is an overused concept. They could have done a better acting job, but it is entertaining. It is a good movie for collectors of disaster movies."
2,Barely Worth Even Checking Out.,"This is probably one of the worst asteroid\meteorite disaster thriller ever made. Some of the special effects in the film were absolutely lousy and the acting was even worse. There were also many flaws in it to many to list. Like I said, not really worth seeing. Almost as bad as ""Meteorite!""."
2,Coulda been worse...,"Well, it would've been worse if this had been a theatrical movie instead of a TV miniseries...on TV, you just lost your valuable time. Think what it would've been like to have paid eight bucks to see it!One aspect of this failure of a movie has been overlooked, and that is the unsuitability for children. There was just too much of the one kid in peril. That scene would give any kid nightmares.By the way, I did see this on TV the first time around, and I do think it was a bit more enjoyable...there were commercial breaks and quite a few of the commercials were more entertaining than the movie.(Hey, I'm getting mean here. LOL)"
1,"Fantasy, not to be confused with facts","This telplay is supposedly based on the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth. That possibility is real, and many people take the issue seriously. One commercial film, Deep Impact, also included some real effort to ""get it right"". However, there is nothing in this film that relates to the real concern about asteroid impacts. This is pure fantasy and thus a turn-off to anyone who has thought seriously about this issue."
1,Dreadful tripe,"This was so bad, that I cannot think of words appropriate to describe it properly. What a stink bomb! The characters were so silly and shallow, I was actually rooting for the asteroid."
1,this is a movie?,"After watching this movie I wish an asteroid would hit Earth, or the movie studio that put it out. And what a lame 4th of July scene. I hope the movie extras in that scene didn't get paid, especially the putz in the white t-shirt. Geeeesh what a waste of video tape."
1,General TV drevel disater film,"The female ASTRONOMER! sees asteroid. Astronomer figures out it will impact the earth. Need I say more.Barf inducting effects, shallow characers(with the exception of Mike B.), cheezy plot, and really BAD ACTING! But what can one expect from the networks. One star is being nice! Dont waste your time, see Meteor or Armageddon."
1,Terrible!,"I watched this movie once, and it made me feel stupid just for buying it. It's horribly innacurate, and terribly made. The characters have about as much depth as poetry by Homer Simpson. Rent it, then do the video store a favor, and burn the tape."
4,KISS OF THE ASTEROID,"FACT: This is a science FICTION movie.FACT: The thought of asteroids hitting the earth is frightening.FACT: Considering this is a TV movie, it's a remarkable feat to make this overall so good.FACT: Michael Biehn is like Kurt Russell and Kiefer Sutherland, a good actor who hasn't quite got the right role yet.FACT; Annabella Sciorra is so lethargic, one can doubt she's feeling anything at all.FACT: Anthony Zerbe is still a great character actor.FACT; The demolition of Dallas is devastating.FACT: For what it is, this is a very enjoyable and mind-boggling movie."
2,The crown is...,"...MUCH TOO SMALL for a man's watch! The crown is very small and without knurling- almost impossible to get a grip on and turn for any guy with normal sized fingers- and mine are on the slim side. Additionally, I couldn't get the day of the week dial to flip over along with the date. I'd wake up in the morning and look at it and the only thing that changed was the date- the day of the week remained the same. Its just a very hard watch to get along with. Ended up returning it."
4,Accurate and attractive,The watch face is easily seen. Accuracy is very good and the small size makes it easy to wear. Several people have commented that it is a good looking watch and asked where I got it. The solar function has worked well.
4,Nice stylish watch for the price,"My Sieko Kinetic needed repair again for the capacitor so I decided to buy a new watch that was about the same cost of repair. The Citizen Eco-Drive is a nice watch, especially for the sale price and is much lighter than the Sieko. Would have given it five stars but for the minute hand as it is sometimes hard to see in dim light."
4,Very Good,"Just as advertised; I've had it 3 weeks. It has a class look about it without being ""loud""; I would buy it again."
3,Works but cheap wrist band,"I've had this watch for a month or so. Still ticking so that's good. Pretty thin and light, which I like. But man, the ""leather"" wrist band is el cheapo. Even after this short period of ownership, the fake brown outer layer has rubbed off the buckle area...and I wear long sleeved shirts to work.If you're a larger man, forget it; the wrist band may not go around your wrist."
1,not what i expected,"The watch face was smaller than i thought and the band doesnt fit, I found another watch similarthat i just love. Wasnt able to return the watch so i had to give it to my son"
5,elegant low maintenance watch,"I wanted a watch that wasn't bulky, looked nice, had the date and showed the minute notches between the hours so I could know the exact time. This watch was everything I was looking for and more since it also never needs a battery change since it gets charged by light whether indoors or outdoors. The band looks nice and I have had no problems with it (some other reviewer was complaining about it). It keeps time accurately and I am totally satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this watch to anyone.I was trying to work out to what degree it was water resistant and found some conflicting descriptions online about that, but believe it only has a basic degree of water resistance. I.e. it is okay with rain and the like but don't take it swimming."
3,Be aware of the description,"I received my watch last Thursday but I was out of town until today. The watch is pretty but the band seems to be used? Perhaps it's just the style.However, after reading the instruction, I came to realize that the watch is not water proof as stated in the description. Called citizen customer service and was told this watch only has a superficial water resistant depth. The description is wrong, you would damage your water under 330 Feet!Be careful before you buy!"
3,nice watch,"The watch is beautiful, although it arrived non-functional. The instructions say to leave it in the full sun for 11 hours to have a full charge, so, hopefully, it will work one day soon. Not especially satisfied with the packaging: it seemed worn."
4,Comfortable - Expect Compliments,"The month/day is a little difficult to nail down, as I would be halfway through a Wednesday and it would tell be it's Tuesday - but once you get used to it and the band loosens up a little from use, you're enjoyment will increase.For the money, it's comfortable, recharges itself, and fits nicely with many different color combinations worn during the course of a normal business day."
4,Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Gold-Tone Leather Watch #BM8242-08E,"I have had the watch a year and a half, and I really like it.It keeps perfect time.It handles getting wet.It is classy looking.That being said, this is what I don't like about the watch.The leather band is showing wear and developing that smell from getting wet and absorbing sweat. All leather bands do it.Very difficult to see the second hand. It is so thin it can hardly be seen on the black face of the watch.The day and date are difficult to see unless the watch is in direct light. No big deal, if I want to time something I use the digital stop watch on my phone, and I'm usually aware of what day it is and the date.I would buy the watch again.I love not having to get batteries changed, just make sure it gets exposed to light. Have gone through 2 dreary, overcast winters without having any problems with the charge.Overall, a good buy."
3,Everyday watch,"The watch is a solid everyday, accurate, and durable timepiece; however the band is cheap looking and does not stand up even after only a few days."
5,Beautiful watch for a gift.,"I gave this watch to my husband for father's day and he liked how easy it was the read the time with the color contrast between the hands, numbers and face. The leather band is of good quality.Not sure how well the eco-drive will work to keep power to the watch. It is light powered, so we will see."
4,Awesome,"I needed a watch to wear on air, I am a newscaster. I looks great on my wrist, it looks great on air, I love it"
5,what a fine gift!,I purchased this as a gift and it is beautiful. It looks very rich and comes in a fancy box. The eco feature is very cool; no batteries ever needed.
3,Solar Style,"When it has came down to Citizen, they definitely have made some excellent watches, time and time again. But nevertheless, there are some pieces that they have made that could have had a bit more to match. This Citizen Eco-Drive piece is alright. But it does display a mixture of both accents and numerals 4, 8, and 12 on the piece. It is alright but honestly it could have had a bit more in its features. It snugs very comfortably around the wrist and is easy to setup on the time. Yet, I did though wish there could have been a little more in its features including illuminated hands that glow in the dark, and a bit more in the feature of the face. Still, you do get a quality watch from Citizen Eco-Drive, but more could have been added here in this solar timepiece.Price: C+Comfort & Setup: C+Overall: C+"
4,"Excelente Reloj, BBB Bueno Bonito y Barato","Es mi primer Reloj comprado en Amazon, igual que muchos, pense, que las fotos serian retocadas, etc, etc, pero una vez en mis manos, sobrepaso a todas mis expectativas, no le doy las 5 estrellas por que la correa esta muy corta, apenas en el ultimo agujero, OJO pa los manotas consideren gastar en una correa extra.Saluds desde Tijuana..."
1,"Nice-looking watch, but ""day of week"" complication will not work","I did some research by consulting major watch forums, reputable dealers, and those who I know to be knowledgeable about watches. In short, I was told that Citizen makes great watches. That's why I was so disappointed when I began to set this watch. As a few one-star reviews have previously commented, the ""day of the week"" complication would not work; the subdial was simply stuck on ""SUN"". Being the optimistic guy that I am, I exchanged the item and gave Citizen another chance. My disappointment turned to frustration when I received the second watch a few days later, and it too had a faulty ""day of the week"" complication.I'm sad, because I really wanted to give Citizen a good review and enjoy their product. Yet 2 watches in a row with faulty ""day of week"" complications cannot be overlooked. Please look elsewhere for your timepieces."
4,A must have for any soon to be Bloodhound owner!,"This book has everything you need to know about the Bloodhound breed. It shows pictures of how to take care of your Bloodhound ect.... I bought this book to learn more about the breed and to train my Bloodhound to track game, and it has worked perfectly for my needs. The only thing they don't really mention in this book is how serious the ear problem is for Bloodhounds. My Bloodhound for example needs her ears cleaned about every 3 days. If you don't clean their ears that often they will get a really bad ear infection and the only way to get it out is surgery, around $500.00 worth. They are a very high maintenance animal but are well worth the effort."
5,"Love these old ""Scary Movies""","There is a market for these old movies. I personally love them and spent many a Saturday glued to the screen watching them. Some, like ""Monolith Monsters"" are almost impossible to find in any format. The transfers and sound are crisp and clean, great job. Only demerit comes from the lack of ""Extras,"" but I am not downgrading the set on that basis as these were released in an era when takes and alternate scenes were not saved. Few of the principals are likely alive to interview. That minor caveat aside there is a lot to savor and enjoy- mysix year old loves to watch them with me as they are not too scary.Now, about VOLUME #3, when will it come out? Plenty of material, plenty of interest, how about it guys?"
5,NOW THIS IS SCI-FI,I watched these classics as a kid and I can tell you they are just as good now as they were then. I was glad to see they finally were affordable.
5,Universal Sci Fi = Tremendous hours of Entertainment,"First off Universal Pictures is awesome especially they're horror/sci fi films, I love em all even awful ones like Cult of the Cobra 1955. All the films in the set only come with a theatrical trailer as a special feature. Each Volume comes with 5 films.Volume 1 is better than volume 2 but volume 2 is still cool.Volume 1:The Monolith Monsters 1957: 2 1/2 stars out of 5The Incredible Shrinking Man 1957: 5 stars out of 5Monster on the Campus 1958: 4 1/2 stars out of 5Tarantula 1955: 3 1/2 stars out of 5The Mole People 1956: 4 1/2 stars out of 5Volume 2:Cult of the Cobra 1955:2 1/2 stars out of 5The Land Unknown 1957: 4 stars out of 5The Deadly Mantis 1957: 5 stars out of 5The Leech Woman 1959: 2 stars out of 5Dr.Cyclops 1940: 5 stars out of 5"
1,Cheated again!!,"So now if you want to buy the second set, you have to buy the first set again. Punished for being a little ahead of the trend once again. It's sad that the rights to these great titles are owned by such greedy bastards."
1,only one worth watching,"hi all, I have been waiting for ""The Mole People"" to come out on dvd for a long time. I had it on vid, but gave away the player. I don't have much money now, so I am dissapointed that it's only offerred in this large, and largely worthless, collection. The Mole People is not typical ""campy"" 50's sci fi. It's interesting and intelligent, with wonderful and creative script, sets, costumes, make-up, acting, and even, like the narrator says at the begining, a message for all of us. I think some talented, blacklisted people found themselves working on this low-budget, B-movie type project and put their best into it regardless. So if you have money to throw away on the rest of the silly trash in the collection, by all means buy it for this one gem."
4,A Treasure Trove,"This collection is a veritable treasure trove of 1950's B Sci-fi movies. If you enjoy this type of film, you are guaranteed to love this box set, as some of the most memorable schlock films of that era are included here."
4,Universal classics review,"The transfers of these films are nothing short of amazing. The Land Unknown, The Deadly Mantis, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Tarantula, The Monolith Monsters and Dr Cyclops are the best films in this set. Cult of the Cobra sounds exciting but it's a big let down same with The Monster on the Campus. The Mole People is an okay film but not up to the standards of The Land Unknown which is also in this set. The Leech Woman I have'nt watched it yet. The dvd's were lacking on extras but that's nothing new the video presentations of these films more than makeup for it and the packaging was porrly done but other than that it's a nice collection of 1950's sci-fi films and highly recommend it to sci-fi fans or fans of giant monster movies. A great way to start a collection of American made monster movies."
4,looks vintage,I like the vintage look. It is eclectic. Adds atmosphere to our living room. The downside was that there is not a switch on it. It was an effort to hang.
3,Good but awkward,"This is a great pillow. We've had no problems with allergies or stiff necks or anything since getting these pillows. However, they are only comfortable if your head is in one position: with your face pointed towards the ceiling. If you want to lay on your side, your head gets engulfed in the sides of the pillow and it's hard to breathe without having the pillow get in the way."
2,Good idea--didn't pull it off,"This pillow looked great. The orthopedic benefits of having a pillow supporting your neck are great. However, the middle section of this pillow was filled too much and therefore very hard. It gave me a headache everytime I used it. It has made a good cat bed however!"
4,"Pitch black comedy, flawed, but unique and striking","Almodovar meets DePalma in this dark thriller with less `jokes' than most of his films, though black humor pervades the whole thing. All the characters are obsessed with death; a murderess who kills during sex, a teacher of matadors who lives to kill, and masturbates to snuff films, and a student who wishes he could kill but faints at the sight of blood. Some of the twists are silly, obvious and/or cop-outs, and the characters never feel `real', but there are some great, operatic disturbing and funny moments as well. Sort of a thinking person's, surrealist `Fatal Attraction'. Some of it is clunky, but the film sticks with me. Very good performances all around. Most major critics I respect liked it even more than me, and I'll probably re-visit it down the line. It seems like the kind of film that could easily grow on a second viewing -- its flaws more forgivable, its strengths more powerful."
3,Poor insulation on connecting wire.,"I put one of these on my van a year ago. It has worked fine, but as I was changing the oil the other day I noticed that the rubber covering over a large copper wire (I think that connects the solenoid to the starter) had cracked open and the bare wire was visible. I used liquid electrical tape to seal and encapsulate it, but I shouldn't have had to do this after just one year."
5,Incredible book; Uplifting; Hopeful,"This book arrived quickly and was in perfect condition.I highly recommend this book (and the other by the authors: If Grace is True)for anyone searching to understand God and his unconditional love and grace. While I don't agree with all the ideas in this book, it sure got me to thinking about things and people in a different way. A gentler, more nonjudgmental, loving way. Definitely a refreshing change from the fire and brimstone approach (fear, fear, fear, sin, sin, sin) of some churches and people. I have a hard time believing in such a mean, vengeful God/Heavenly Father."
5,there are two authors,"While I agree totally with Leigh's Fleming's review of If God is Love, I would like to say that there are two authors, Philip Gulley AND Jim Mulholland. I know both of these wonderful people and have the honor to attend a Quaker meeting where Jim is pastor. I know the hours of collaboration that have taken place in order to bring this beautiful, challenging concept to fruition and I pray that the dedicated effort to share their journey with others touches the hearts of all who read this book."
1,"This book should be titled,""If the Bible isn't true...""","This book fails to recognize the inerrancy of the Bible. If you are a bible-believing Christian, this book is not for you. This book should not be written under the Christian guise. Rather, it should be written as a philosophical book and not taught in any church."
2,"Please, come to the Scriptures with humility","My mother has been friends with Mr. Mulholland and his family for several years, and she and I will both testify that he is a kind man with good intentions. However, we are both saddened by the message he and the other writer put forward in this book and his other works. I sincerely hope that readers of this book will not embrace everything that is said without also going to the scriptures to examine his claims. I feel this issue is important enough to warrant such extended study, and I hope you do as well."
1,so the Bible doesn't exist?,"I am horrified that people might read this book and believe it. Satan is real and this is just another one of his lies to make people not believe in Jesus Christ and heaven AND HELL. This book would have gotten a 0 star if I could have. The theology is so wrong and it breaks my heart that they are trying to make a profit about ""what they believe"". Their belief does NOT change the Truth. The Bible is true, as is Heaven and Hell and Satan."
4,IF GOD IS LOVE,"Very good, although I don't agree with all statements, I do believe this book reveals just why the Church, of all denominations are declining, because of the beliefs that each church had people in positions that truly believe their church and their ways of worshiping are the only to Heaven."
1,"Give everything to ""de po'"" which we will always have with us","I always liked Mr. Gulley's books until I read or tried to read this one.It was the most communist inspired book I have ever seen. He blamed me, at least I felt like he did, for everything from slavery to the 9-11 attack. According to him we should kiss all these mustlims (or whatever they are) and ask their forgivness for them attacking and killing our people which weren't even all Americans, but people of every nationality.I don't mind helping those less fortunate, but I enjoy my material possesions and feel that I earned them. IIf I would lose all my possesions today, I could handle it. After all I can learn to be miserable in about three minutes."
5,Anyone Who Loves Music...,"...must have this DVD in their collection. This is music history, and should be a part of college courses that teach the arts.For those who complain that this wasn't a movie about the lives of the individual artists or didn't give more attention to the great James Jamerson, two points: 1. This is a documentary, not a biographical movie. It wasn't intended to be another ""Ray"" or ""The Temptations."" 2. In my opinion, Jamerson might be the greatest bassist who ever lived, but this documentary is the story of The Funk Brothers, not any single member of the group."
4,Worth a look for History pundits,"Well,Good information on the whole history of motown, but in my opinion it lost my intrest many times due to the fact of so much talking but less music along the way.Sometimes it became confusing also for others around me who where not that familiar with motown and the talk of the band artists until they heard a familuar song, or tune from this era that they had heard on the radio in the past.Apart from the above I really liked it, but I have only played it one time so far, and maybe I need to review it for further inputs I may have missed during questons asked of me during the play time.This is not the best buy I have made, but it is history to pass on to my kids in the future."
2,"good info, but overall dull","I was looking forward to seeing this documentary. However I was sorely disappointed, becuase it's much too slick. It has that corporate ""Buena Vista Social Club"" feel about it. What really put me off is the initial interviews with the ""real music fans"" in the record store. These were obviously scripted responses(""No, who ARE The Funk Brothers!"") to simple questions (""Do you know who The Funk Brothers are?"") - also, the way it was filmed is mighty annoying. The director uses that ""Ken Burns pan effect"" throughout this film, and everything looks way too perfect. There are a couple of touching scenes in the old Motown studios, but overall I was left with a vacant feeling. Plus, am I mistaken, or is Berry Gordy almost completely absent from this film? Watch it if you're a hardcore Motown fan, otherwise just spend your money on a good Motown compilation."
2,Motown disappointment,"I was looking forward to seeing the actual footage of the singers. I do appreciate the story of the fellows behind the artists but still, I think the video would have been more enjoyable had they included the actual singers."
5,Review of Standing in the Shadown of Motown,"This is a great documentary for fans of Motown. I rented the DVD on a whim. What I found was a film with so much heart and soul that I have to purchase it as well as the CD. I especially liked Joan Osborne's rendition of ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted."" That is perhaps one of my all-time favorite Motown songs."
5,The best movie of the year!!,"What a movie! Emotional, fun, historical, moving, toe-tapping, glorious. These guys are beyond amazing. I loved every minute of it. And the extras are fantastic. I'm giving this DVD to everyone I know for their birthdays or for Christmas."
5,great movie what can you say,"they essentially wrote the music to the so-called motown sound along with some gifted producers and composers who needed the ""funk brothers""to make those arrangments come true so to the ""badartcrtic"" reviewer who said that it was the producer doesn't know about music.And then they prove it with modern musicians who sing their heart out with the exception of marvin gaye and stevie wonder (who wrote their own material and learned at the feet of the funk brothers and those same arrangers and producers)this is a great documentary and i loved every minute of both dvds go out and buy this wonderful movie."
5,The truth revealed,"I was originally looking for a video on James Jamerson (baddest bass man to ever pick up the instrument). To my surprise, the video told more about the Motown hit machine than I expected. The Funk Brothers, the heart and soul of Motown, were responsible for the fame and notoriety of just about every singer on the label. Motown had exceptionally talented vocalists, but the grooves laid down by Funk Brothers took them over the top. These unsung heroes deserve the full credit due them. These brother's grooves are alive today in just about everything we hear. By the end of the video, I felt as if I knew these guys personally. Several of them have passed on before and since the making of this video, but their legacies to the R&B genre will live forever. This video was a long overdue and well deserved tribute to some of the baddest cats in music...ever!!!"
5,Do yourself a favor and get it,"This might be the best 10 bucks you'll ever spend if you like Motown or heck if you like music. It leaves you wanting to know more and many of us who grew up with this music should know more. While some of their stories are heartbreaking it was a pleasure to see Pistol Allen smiling behind the drums even though he was so sick he would die shortly after the completion of the film. It was a sad moment too when two of the surviving brothers describe their last encounter with James Jamerson who would die the day after their visit. But there is fun too, fun for the Funk Brothers and fun for us as we are honored to hear these guys play and play they still can. The band is still very tight and very good. The vocalist do an admirable job of interpreting the hits. It would have been nice to have been graced with Marvin Gaye's and David Ruffin's presence but this is about the Funk Brothers and I for one am damn glad I got to see it.Thanks to Dr. Lick's for putting this together."
1,Wish I could stand in the shadow!,I couldn't play the movie because there was some sort of regional lock on it. Why ship someone a product they can't use? I know Amazon knows where I live (and a whole lot more).
5,If you like Mowtown you gotta see this,This is a great documentary of a group of musicians that no one knows but everyone has heard. This is the story of the music behind the mowtown hits...the Funk Brothers. It is entertaining and informative with the right blend of humor and seriousness. The sound is excellent. This should be in every schools music appreciation class. You cant help but move to the groove. It is a must see. I made my teenage kids watch it and now they are hooked.
5,Where was I?,"I missed this first time out, and I am a huge Motown fan. Now, when I hear the music, I am picturing the musicians, feeling their stories. I highly recommend this to any Motown lovers......"
5,The Real Talent of Motown,"It took Alan Schlutsky over 15 years to get this story told. His goal was finally accomplished. These excellent musicians finally have a little slice of the notoriety that they have deserved since the '60's. I have known many of them and they are much more talented than the movie could possibly show. Rest in peace 'Pistol' Allen and Johnny Griffith. You finished the movie, and never had a chance to see how excellent it is, but your story was told."
5,Rich in music history!,"The stories from the greatest band that very few have ever heard of. The Funk Brothers also proved they can make anybody sound like they were a MoTown artist. I recommend this dvd and accompaning music cd to everyone, especially if you are a music buff."
4,Informative,Great behind the scenes story of the musicians who made the Motown sound. The video would be interesting for any musician or for anyone who grew up listening to the great music of the 60's and 70's that came from Motown.
5,"Awesome, enjoyable and informative","My husband and I enjoyed this dvd. I never knew who were the Funk Brothers until this dvd, which was recommended by a friend. The music is awesome and it is a documentary to enjoy time and time again."
5,Standing in the Shadows of Motown,I saw part of this on television. I knew at that point that I had to have the DVD. I did not know that it was two DVD's. Very enlightening. Anyone that grew up during the Motown era should have it.
5,Never Knew About Them,"With many of my favorite groups, I know they have stage hands doing backup on recordings and live concerts, but I did not know that such a group existed that did so much and lasted such a long time. Granted, my forte is not Motown, but I do like it. There has been a consistent high quality from many groups, but I was suprised at how much of it was based on the Funk Brothers. Certainly one of the best documentaries I have seen in the past two years."
4,Standing in the Shadows of Motown,"THIS . . . Is NOT the Documentary that the Legend---Whichis MOTOWN deserves. Instead of expanding the storyto cover the dozens of contributors, this Video coversa group of Musicians (A group of Very Unique Musicians)But, what about the real and up-close stories ofso many stars --- and HOW THEY GOT TO Grand Blvd . . .)"
5,"The film was a long time coming , finally respect is given","For many years , it was known amongst musicians that many of the great Motown songs had great backing bands .Not many people knew who they were .This film is about them - they are deservedly the focus .These guys were the supporting players and how often do those people get the attention ? Not very often , it seems .Stars' egos usually get satisfied - after all , they have the press and PR people .Well done to the Funk Brothers - I am still fascinated and awed by your gifts .As far as I'm concerned , the hit records are yours ."
5,"The ""power"" under the hood!","A ""behind the scenes"" type look at the real musicians behind the Motown sound. They made the greats happen... sure there were some soulful vocalists; It was the combination that worked. There would be no Motown sound without the Funk Brothers. Interesting and highly recommended!"
5,Standing in the Shadows of Motown,Best DVD in my collection. By far. After watching it I ordered 3 more to give to friends and I may buy more. It's amazing to find all that music behind the Motown hits was played by the group of guys.. and now I know who they are.
4,pretty good video,"well done, gets the story across, video and audio quality are fine. i'd give a higher rating if the issues were more compelling. but if you know what it's about, it does deliver."
4,Math text,"Worthless, dated text. It's from a CA high school and I'm shocked to have it assigned to my grad school math class! The print was so small with few illustrations, our professor ended up not using it!"
1,Not good,"I am a huge James Galway fan, but I thought this recording was strangely off. He just seemed to be toodling his way along without a sense of direction, and the lines of the music didn't come through -- at least not to me. There were some good moments, but not enough, and some moments when I could swear he was actually off-key or not quite in sync with the other two musicians. I'm tossing it."
4,"What, no carrying case?","An outrageously expensive pair of tweezers. For the price, I would have liked a secure carrying case to be included. No such luck. Therefore, I won't take these tweezers with me on any trips out of town.I bought these for the pleasure of using a superior tool. What sets these tweezers apart is their rigidity. The metal does not bend much while in use, which gives a feeling of precision. The next best tweezer is probably from Tweezerman, at a fraction of the price. The Tweezerman product matches Rubis in most respects, except for the rigidity."
5,Absolutely worth the money!,"I have always owned the $5 tweezers sold at the grocery. On a recommendation, I purchased a pair of Rubis tweezer. The make plucking very nearly painless! I wish I had known this years ago!"
4,sharp precise tweezers,"I tried a few pairs of Tweezerman tweezers for everyday beauty use, but was never that impressed. I finally did some research and decided to give this pair a try and I'm glad I did. Although they are so sharp they sometimes break the hair instead of plucking it out, they are far superior to other tweezers I've used. They are sharp. precise and don't tear up my skin like more blunt tweezers can. All in all, I'm happy with the product and think it was worth the price as long as they last (I've had them about three months)"
4,Rubis Stainless Steel - Slant Classic Tweezer,The most expensive tweezer i have ever purchased. It's sharp but doesn't pull out hair as well as i thought.
1,not for me,I am always looking for a good pair of tweezers for facial hairs that drive me to despair...when I saw these I thought they might do the trick but they don't work at all.
2,not sharp,I spent so much money on this item hoping that the high price means it will be better quality than the cheap alternatives. It is already blunt. Not happy with the quality. And yes i always cleaned after use and also closed it with the enclosed closing stuff
2,I really wanted to love these...,"For the past 10 years I have been using a pair of cheap drug store tweezers - they finally got so bad that they were impossible to use. I pluck my eyebrows and chin every single day (sometimes twice a day)so I decided to splurge and buy the best tweezers I could find. After reading various reviews I bought these over the Tweezerman - I was SO excited to get them and thought they would be amazing and that they would save me so much time! I was super disappointed - they are no better than my cheap drugstore pair, in fact, in some ways they are worse. The hairs slip right out of the tweezers - and the points are so sharp that they end up nicking my skin. Over the past couple weeks they've gotten a little better as I've gotten used to them, but really they are so not worth the $26 I paid for them! Maybe I just had unrealistic expectations?"
4,"Good, but sharp!","The tweezers do what they should, i.e., pluck unwanted hairs from the skin, but beware when using them because the edges are both pointed and sharp. If planning to use them to pluck ear hairs be quite careful with them. Otherwise, the steel in them is excellent and they should last a very long time."
2,nope,"I didn't care how much these were as long as they worked well. Unfortunately, these tweezers didn't work too much better than the standard Revlon pair from CVS. Sharp point, but don't grip every time."
2,Dregs,"This is some of the absolute worst intentionally-created music in the history of humanity, which in itself makes it somewhat intriguing, and which made it the perfect music for the ""disco dancing"" scenes in ""Borat: Cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan."""
2,Needs Improvement,Great money belt in terms of number of compatrments and accessibility. I got a skin rash on my stomach where I wore the belt and I do not have sensitive skin. I think this is if the weather got hot I would perspire under the belt. After one trip the belt is worn looking at the back an the material is fraying. Also some thoght should be given to how to secure the loose strap to the money belt so this is not left hanging
3,Good Idea - Bad Zipper,"I purchased this belt for my recent trip to Italy since I was going to be visiting areas with numerous pickpockets. The belt is very comfortable; however, after using it for only two days, the zipper broke. And I did not over-stuff the stash area to create the problem. I was able to retrack the zipper but am disappointed that this happened. Also a better design would allow for securing the belt (excess) that goes around your waist."
3,Good general introduction for technically oriented reader,"Well organized book which ranges over the topics of general design principles to the mechanics of pressure hulls, boyancy, propolusion and underwater hydrostatics. For the technicaly oriented beginner, insights into the specifics design parameters suffer by the authours' frequent ommission of definitions for their terms. Overall well worth the time to orienting oneself to the subject of submarine design."
2,Definitely NOT Jerry Butler at his best,"Sorry Bradley Briggs, that's definitely not Jerry Butler at his best! It seems by 1980 Jerry Butler lost the sparkle and funk of his 1976 ""Love's on the Menu"" album and the fabulous groove on his joint album with Thelma Houston. Once you experienced these, it's hard to settle for anything less. I am confident in his huge catalogue there are some more pearls like these.I wish I knew them all and they were not out of print..."
3,Steele Not There Yet (3 Stars),"It's hard to put a finger on exactly what's wrong with this album. The production is good, but too many of the songs sound alike. Bigg Steele has a nasaly flow that can be a chore to listen to, but there are still quite a few good songs to be found. What plagues the album most are the suspect hooks and from time to time, the lame subject matter. Don't look too hard for substance here, I mean, it is gangsta rap. But the potential for success is still evident. Bigg Steele is definitely pointed in the right direction, but it feels like something is missing from this album."
4,Revealing.,This is an excellent little book. Not for the squeamish. It's half in-your-face reality and half poetic silliness. I liked it. Not unlike Catcher in the Rye.
5,Bible of Open Space,This is a very good hand-book for open space newcomers.Easy to understand and easy to read.I strongly suggest this book for anybody who want to start learning open space technology
5,This is a concept that really works in actual practise!,"After reading this book, I attended an Open Space conducted by a trained facilitator. The results were fantastic! Just as described in this User Guide. It is easy to understand and captures the essential understanding necessary to conduct or participate in an Open space event."
1,AMAZING Series... Bad Reissue Company,"5 Stars for the show... No Stars for Shout! Factory.This is one of my all-time Favorite TV Shows. It's one of the Smartest shows ever on TV. Great Writing, Directing and Acting. Great Characters. Amazing stuff.But...As a die-hard fan, I've already purchased the first Three Seasons - one-half at time - released by Roxbury/Infinity Entertainment Group... and they weren't cheap.I did the same with Barney Miller. I purchased the first 3 Seasons, one at a time, years apart. Then Shout! put out all 8 Seasons last year. It wasn't that bad since those first three seasons were cheap and only 3/8 of the Seasons total.It's not the same with Route 66. Shout should take into account that we fans have already purchased the first three seasons... and at least release the 4th Season separately."
5,Nice set and a great show.,"Trust me, I have a bootleg set of R-66 and these are vastly superior to those. It's like watching the whole series for the first time. My God, Tod has freckles?! The picture is good enough to appreciate the cinematography which was pretty remarkable, such as leaving people in the background out of focus. Shading is very good. Like I said, Martin Milner has freckles. I'm very glad I bought this set and certainly would again. Very grateful."
1,Thanks reviewers,"After the New York Times article I rushed eagerly to buy this on Amazon. First, I almost bought the wrong set, something called 75th Anniversary something but a reviewer alerted me that this was not the series. Then when I found the series and read about the companies producing it etc. I decided to take a pass. I am really grateful to the reviewers who took the time to explain what this set was and was not and thanks to Amazon for making the reviews available. Too bad though. If the company had released a first-rate product they would have had at least one more sale."
3,Shout Factory...you WERE once the best :(,"I am so thankful to Shout Factory for giving me Season 4 of Route 66. I am hoping they can remaster Season 1 from the Infinity releases because some episodes were in bad condition. Although I already have seasons 1 to 3, I will fork out the money for this remastered set to get the 4th season.As you can see, my hopes for a remastered season 1 are gone....So I give 3 stars because you gave me season 4, but oh how I wish you had of remastered season 1 properly."
5,24 Carat Gold From The Golden Age Of Television,"The intense competition between movies and television shows from 1955-65 created an unprecedented stream of high-quality TV shows. ""ROUTE 66"" features stellar acting, provocative themes, and terse scripts, which makes it a towering standout amongst its incredible peers. For those who appreciate first-rate drama that has the courage to confront controversy in the finest democratic tradition of providing a catalyst for reflection and discussion, this memorable television series is an absolute ""must""!"
2,Hardly Worth the Money,"After I decided to shell out 65 bucks for a book of only 280 pages I was disappointed that the page count included filler chapters such as ""Introduction to the Internet"" and ""Introduction to Object Technology"". The remainder is primarily an overview of different distributed technologies, e.g. COM, CORBA etc.If you are interested in a good overview over EAI, I recommend to get for Fred Cummins' and / or Chris Britton's books instead (about the same price for both of them)."
2,I was Disappointed,"I agree with the review from J.K. Kelley. The guide for HL was fantastic! The ideal book would be the HL guide with the map format in the Opposing Force book.I don't like the paragraph-style walkthrough. The numbered format in the HL guide is excellent.The Opposing Force guide does have the information you need if you get stuck somewhere, but it doesn't have the step-by-step information like the HL guide."
5,A Must!,"I have read them all and I like this one! I am truely the flea market shopper! I loved the photo's this book offered and the idea's. With all the garage sales in our area we are never at a loss..I especially loved the way it taught me a little bit about each subject you find at a flea market..i.e. china, books, toys. The best part though would be the photo's. They lend your eye the lasting look of oh! I could use this technique with this....."
1,decorating.....not,"i ordered this book to give me some ideas and decorating tips, what i got are pictures of old flea market items, that have nothing to do with each other. didn't help a bit, and truthfully if it didn't cost so much to return, i'd return it in a second."
1,Is it Halloween yet?,"I love antiques and most anything of age but... this book has some creepy ideas! If you like old broken doll heads or other body parts planted in containers as topiaries, then this is a book for you! I personally would not want an old bathroom sink as a focal point in my entryway either! Book for sale!!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Flea Market Style : Decorating with a Creative EdgeI couldnt wait to receive this book. I have a love of JUNKING, and turning trash into treasure, but perhaps my expectations were too high, when I ordered this book. I expected to find page after page of TRUE flea market style furniture and accessories, and how it was used in the home. In my opinion, this book fell far short of what I thought it would be. Trust me, dont waste your money@!!!"
2,"One, If Not The Worst","I love browsing magazines and books for ideas and inspiration and I have been flea marketing for forty-five years. This book by far is one of the worst I've looked at. I can usually garner at least, one idea from a book, but this book had nothing to offer and I could not imagine living in some of the houses and rooms featured."
2,Shabby Chic mixed with a little creepy,"This book is basically photos of antiques and flea market finds, artfully placed in rooms. I didn't find anything that I haven't already seen in 100 other shabby chic books.The creepy part is the taking antique doll heads and putting them on top of plants and calling it a topiary. Creepy and very unattractive.If you are looking for ways to revamp old flea market finds, this isn't the book for you. THis book is for people who are buying revamped pieces from stores and vendors."
1,Tested on kids and it doesn't work,I made almost every single recipe in this book and the kids liked only 2 or 3 dishes. It says that it has been kid-tested but I really wonder where and how because it didn't work in my household.
4,"Great bag - good looking, but....","This is an excellent bag that fits my macbook pro 17 like a glove. Moreover, it's properly stylish, unlike those TUMI-style black bags that you see worn by travelling salesmen carrying Dell laptops in airports. It's thin, has lots of (flattish) pockets for magazines, walllets, cards, iphone etc. However keep in mind that it is thin, so you're not going to get more than say 2-3 books or magazines in there.My only gripes are with the power supply pocket which flaps outside the bag. It's a good solution, and keeps the bag looking good, but the silverish finish wears very quickly as the power supply bump inevitably bumps into things."
2,not as described,"I was very happy to find this product as it had a longer waist strap than most. however, the clasp would not stay closed and the bag bunched up. I would not recommend this product."
4,Really cute book,"A good read, not too much mental stimulation, but enough that it was interesting and I could finish it."
5,I Love Charo!,"Que puedo decir de este album? Absolutamente un clasico de la disco. ""Cuchi-Cuchi"" tiene todo el sonido de Salsoul y la orquestacion resulta realmente increible. El album, en si, tiene un sonido mas dirigido hacia el pop, las unicas excepciones son la clasica ""Dance A Little Bit Closer"" y ""Cuchi-Cuchi"". Lo mejor de todo es que se incluyen las versiones extendidas de dichos temas y la remasterizacion es inigualable. Larga vida a Charo!"
1,"Get it together, Amazon!","$20 for the CD, $10 for the mp3 download of ""the album"". That seems fair, no physical material changes hands. But when you look at the mp3 list, there are two tracks which are ""album only"". Why? Wake up, Amazon - charge the extra $0.01 (download $1 instead of the stupid $0.99 which shouldn't fool anybody) and sort out the legal issues!"
5,Terrific! I play it all day long. Customers love it!,"Excellent way to get started. I love the 90 second excerpts because it is constantly fresh. It's literally invigorating to listen to. And you absolutely can't beat the price. I play it all day long at work (Talking Book World) and the customers keep coming up saying, ""Is that for sale?"" But we carry only audiobooks. That last reviewer is an idiot. Buy it today and you won't be disapointed."
3,Pretty good choices...,"If you wanted to boil the great classics down to 99 pieces, this is a pretty standard selection of the best. As others have noted, it has greatly abridged movements--- wouldn't it be nice to expand this selection to four or five discs, and have them all complete? Another problem-- these are in alphabetical order by composer-- it would be more helpful to me to have them in chronological order by period, such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, etc. If that is what you need, try EMI's 6 CD box set, Classical Music for Dummies. Now that is the five star."
5,I can name that tune in three notes,"My family likes to put this disc in on shuffle and play name that tune. I wish they made more discs like this, only with more obscure works."
2,"Too many tunes, too little time.","I found the CD had many wonderful tunes in it, however each tune is approx. 90 seconds long. Not long enough to enjoy it. Not long enough to learn the name of the piece. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but people in elevators."
4,AJACKS,IT IS MY FAVORITE REFERENCE BIBLE FOR STUDY AND SERMON PREPARATION. I DID HAVE SOME DIFFICULTIY LEARNNING TO NAVIGATE IT.
3,Bible,"I really like the Open Bible it has loads of useful information,however, I was disappointed that the study on the Holy Spirit is no longer a part of the study materials."
3,Navigation needs much improvement,"As another reviewer mentioned, the navigation is quite poor in this edition and I think really degrades the experience of reading it. I'm not sure what they could do to improve it but something definitely needs to be done about it. Also, something else to consider is if having the Open Bible on your digital medium such as an iPad or Kindle is the best route? I may end up buying a physical one to be able to easily flip back and forth between books and write physical notes."
5,"The Ioen Bible, Expanded Edition","I found it is handy to read the Bible in the kindle and easy to carry it to church and everywhere I go. It is easy for me to understand and I am able to look up the texts thru the content, old and new testament, then the chapters and then to read the verses."
4,interesting approach - but look for an update,"By all means, I recommend you to read this book. However, since this book came out in 1995, a NEW VERSION is available in paperback. The new version includes an extra preface and some revisions to chapter 2 and chapter 8."
4,Very helpful in contrasting autocratic vs shared leadership,"This book will be very helpful for those leaders who desire to create an environment that draws the best out of people. While many leaders resort to top-down approaches of leadership (dog eat dog), O'Toole demonstrates how a leadership that seeks to find the best in people, encourage people and value their input, yileds both more satisfaction and better results in the long run."
3,Drifters,"Great C.D. However, I would have liked to known that it wasn't music from the later group. There were many different singers over the years and this C.D. has music that sounds different then what I was used to."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic cd! Mr Size is going back to his roots, funky drum and bass, certainly one of this years hits!"
1,absolutely avoid this album,"this is one of the worst album i've ever bought it's too heavy for my tastes, i prefere something like ""new forms"" or even ""in the mode"" but surely not this one.... i think the first two where very sperimental records and (above all the first record) where good cds but this one is cheap teeny music i think it will be a 15ers choice...when the kids will grow they'll tear apart this album for something better i hope!!!! (i gave it 1 star cuz you can't give 0 stars!!!)"
4,Size Matters........,Steve from Miami....When it comes to dnb Size matters..becuz Roni Size can put on an amazingly killer display of tracks.In comparison to his previous album i like this one becuz it's more instrumental you get soaked into the album with beats that Mr.Size Provides.Even though i like rapping over my drum n bass his last album didn't really do it 4 me(i dunno why) it was still hot tho.However in this album The Size is touching down sticking his hands in the ground and going back to his roots cuz the truth is this cat can mix.This is one Ronis best albums since his debut album.He gets really crafty with his tracks also you'r gonna love the excellent introduction he has to the cd 2 me thats a definate classic introduction.Neways BUY this album its HOT!
2,Dont believe the hype,"This album is nothing like Roni's last album: the beats and breaks here are completely repetitive. Listen to one song and you've basically listened to the whole album. No guest vocals either, nothing experimental or new. Just a plain album. A real let-down after his last album. The album had potential, but didn't fulfill my expectations. Get Aphrodite's last album instead. Much better."
2,Little innovation,"Perhaps I'm not a true junglist, but I do not find anything really innovative or amazing about Touching Down. In reflection to Size & Reprazent's first release, New Forms, which at the time destroyed and rebuilt the whole meaning of DnB, I would say Touching Down is your average DnB album. Club favorites maybe, however Size's latest solo work leaves a lot to be desired on the creative side of things."
2,Childish illustrations,"I bought this book because it had such good reviews, but I was very disappointed with the contents. The title is fashion rendering with color, but most of the illustrations are black and white (very misleading). Plus the illustrations don't look very professional in my opinion. If you have no drawing skills but want to become a fashion designer, then this is the right book for you. Otherwise, don't buy it."
3,Rimsky-Korsakov ; Sheherazade (1977),"I've rated this 'title' only as good, because the Berlin Philharmoniker EuroArts disc identified as ""Sheherazade"" is far superior due to its orchestration. Neeme Jarvi is one of my preferred conductors!"
3,"Good, but not the best","First, let me give you my credentials. I have EXTREMELY fine hairs that grow on my lower eyelids and curl into my eyes! (I know, weird, huh.) Anyway, these things bothered me for years until i finally found a way to get them: a small, 15x concav....conve...curved mirror suction-cupped to my bathroom mirror, a small LED flashlight, and some top-of-the-line tweezers. The absolute best tweezers I've found so far are the Tweezerman Slant tip. They grabbed those little hairs and removed them with ease. However, I dropped them and they were history! Ruined! I thought, well to heck with them if they're that fragile; I'll go with these Rubis I've read so much about.I wish now I had just swallowed my anger and bought another pair of Tweezerman. Don't get me wrong, this pair of Rubis are good tweezers and will work nicely for most people. However, they will NOT grab the finest hairs and did not work for me. sigh Now I have to spend another 30 or 40 bucks and get the good ones."
2,Try: Bill's Sliver Gripper Tweezers,"Try: Bill's Sliver Gripper TweezersI have not purchased any other tweezers since finding ""Bill's Sliver Gripper Tweezers"" They are simply the Best, Easiest and Most Painlessly Precise tweezers I have ever owned.... And Amazon has them... $6"
2,Only Lasted a short while,"We got this camera for my daugther for Christmas this past year. It's only a few months old and she has only used it a few times. Today when going to to put new batteries in it, the camera would not work. She has not dropped it, gotten it wet, etc. A brand new camera should last more than a few months. I loved all the things, such as a big screen etc., but I am very disappointed now that something I spent good money on is not working. The camera makes a funny sound, and then when I press the power button it lights up, but that is it. It shows no picture and won't turn off. The camera is for a good cause but beware."
1,Agree with first reviewer.,"Don't even bother spending money on this one. Footage taken from ""Private Dances"" Volumes and spliced in with a pathetic story. Forget this and go directly to the Private Dances DVD's.If you do buy this, be for warned that this is not a professionally pressed DVD. It was burned from someone's computer. When you look at the bottom side of a standard dvd it is either silver or gold in color. This one is blue. A sign this is a copy. In time the blue dye will degrade and the dvd will be dead."
1,killer sex queens from cyberspace,"o.k. as far as campy video's go this one takes the cake...no real plot, realy bad acting, some of the footage namely the glori-anne segment was taken from another video. wasnt worth the time to watch or the money that was spent...and i'm a guy who love's cheesy campy video's. most of the video did not make any sence, the plot hole and their were many of them made no sence. this is the typical movie scenerio as if i had the money i could have done better...and it is my belief that anyone else could have...do not wast your money on this major flop. your i.q. will defenitly drop several points after watching this."
5,Memorable Journey,"The Book of Lights is not as well known as Potok's The Chosen but was much more memorable for me. What struck me most was the convergence of faith, especially the protagonist's developing Judaism and his driver's steadfast Mormonism. The moments of mysticism truly gave me chill bumps. It is less plot driven than The Chosen and will probably never become a movie, thank goodness, but ultimately has more to offer."
2,Only Potok book I've read and not liked,"I wanted to love this book. I expected to love this book. Found an old copy of this in a thrift shop and wondered why I'd never seen it in book shops. Then I read it. I've loved everything else I've read by Chaim Potok, but this book dragged. I felt it had no build, no climax, just kinda strolled along, and then, THE END. I more or less forced my self to finish reading it in stubbornness, and in hopes that the book would pick up, but no... throughout the book I found myself not really caring about any of the characters much.Now, admittedly, I am not Jewish, and and I have only a surface understanding of Kabbalah. While my limited experiences with Judaism has never previously kept me from falling head over heals for a Potok book, it's quite possible that --in this particular case-- it might be ignorance keeping me from seeing any depth to this book."
4,Fascinating clash of cultures,"I read the Book of Lights in Korea where I was stationed (2nd Inf Div), and perhaps for that reason it really came alive for me. The Chaplaincy is a unique institution, in that military clergy provide ministry for all soldiers, not simply for those of one's particular faith group. Then add the Asian element, the post Korean war trauma, along with the personal struggles with faith, and the result is confronting conflicting cultures and ideas, and an internal struggle to find one's identity. A must for readers of Chaim Potok's novels."
5,authentic New Mexican taste,"Being a native New Mexican, I, was skeptical at first. However after tasting the product, I am a believer. Excellent soup base with true New Mexico flavor. I highly reccomend it."
3,Disappointing transfer,"Saw this at the theater and was wowed away by how visually stunning this film is. I was excited to order it on DVD, and received it today, but was disappointed by how low quality the transfer is. The colors are dull and blurry compared to what I saw on the big screen. Total let down because the visuals make the movie."
5,This Film is Awesome!,"Tears of the Black Tiger is an amazing and ground breaking film. Fans of low-budget films that push the limitations of their situations to create unique works of entertainment/art deserved to be seen by a wider audience!I am excited because this film, along with Nang Nak, introduced me to Thai Cinema.. and now I want to see more! Does anyone know if Yam Yasothorn will be available in the United States soon? Or where I can find the soundtrack to this film? Fans of this film should check out 6ixtynin9 by Pen-ek Ratanaruang as well! Enjoy..."
2,"Overpriced, repair if you can","The light is very good BUT...I replaced the lamp after about 3 years with one from Sylvania (Do It Center in SoCal have it) - just as good, much cheaper.Also, the two parts of the tube stem thread on to an internal ferrule - probably aluminum. This ferrule takes a lot of the stress when the lamp is moved, twisted etc other than by the flexible head. Having wrapped the joint in duct tape to help relieve some stress, I bought another year or so of life. The ferrule or tube thread is now stripped on the top half and to replace it would mean complete disassembly beyond the 'knock down' it arrived as, since the cable runs through the ferrule and tubes.I may try a 1"" hose clamp to buy a bit more time before junking it..."
1,repair history,"I had an 18 watt Ottlite floor lamp which worked well for about 4 years. Then the switch went bad and it was impossible to get in repaired. I live in a large metropolitan area, but no repair shops would work on it. The repair shop owners were very helpful--explained I had to go to Ottlite for replacement parts. I did not want the expense of shipping, had discarded original papers in a move, so junked the lamp. Repair shop owners advised me to never get another Ottlite."
1,Shameful Lump in the Landfill Now,"Not only was this lamp overpriced in the first place, but after it stopped working, it cost me the price of two bulbs to find out that it was a ballast problem, not a bulb going out. As previous reviewers have commented, Ott does not offer a replacement ballast. Shame on them for making me throw this entire lamp into a landfill now--it is unfixable. I will never buy another Ott light."
1,Save some grief: Don't buy.,"I have one just like this. It worked for a while and then became unreliable. There's no way to know if the problem is the light or the bulb, even if you have a spare, as I do. And by the way, it is very difficult to insert and remove the bulbs. Since bulbs are expensive, I don't feel like buying another one, only to find that the lamp still won't work.By the way, I bought the lamp to evaluate photographic prints. I work in dim light and just turn on the Ott light occasionally. But I've now learned that if you turn the light on and off frequently, the bulb life will be very short. This agrees with my experience.This lamp, which was not inexpensive, is going to the dump."
2,first daughter,well it was funny thought the mother didn't much care for her daughter only her husbands carear. The ending left you guessing will they get together. I liked chasing liberty better at least they got back together at the end of the movie. The movies are alike but chasing liberty was better.
3,Fascinating history or more accurately HERstory,Who knew there were such goings on....going on so long ago. Not I.Albert Payson Terhune who most people seem to know from his many collie stories is quite the witty writer. I often paused in this book to admire the turn of a phrase and his judicious use of euphemisms.
3,Neck Stash,"Plan to use this neck stash when I go to Europe this coming Fall. it will be fine, but was disappointed that it doesn't have a zippered compartment!!!! Love ordering from Amazon, always quick service!!! Judy Herrick, Maine"
3,meh,"This ended up being a bit of a pain when I wore it under my clothes on our recent trip to the Uk, so it ended up serving as more of an inefficient wallet in my purse."
1,"Product is not white, it's beige","There is no mention of the color in the description, but the photos are clearly pure white. Product is actually beige. Returned."
4,I feel quite Secure,"I purchased two of these for a trip to Europe to be worn under our shirts for security and safety against pick-pockets. When the pouches arrived I was pleased with my purchase. The neck straps a little on the flimsy side, I think, and could easily be cut with a knife if it were worn outside the shirt. But underneath a shirt it will be perfectly sound. These pouches will fit my passport and money/credit cards easily and not be too bulky at the same time. Velcro secures the fold over top flap."
3,Smells fresh!,This is a good product for ladies who like to smell fresh all day. Just a spritz or two will do it. I like it a lot and its a good everyday type fragrance. Save the heavy stuff for the evenings.
2,Disappointing Mompou from Larrocha,"If you can find Alicia de Larrocha's recordings of Mompou on London/Decca, they are far more preferable to this RCA recording.Most of the Songs and Dances is wonderful music; the Preludes are interesting, but I could have done without these. Why couldn't she instead have recorded Mompou's ""Variations on a theme of Chopin"", a wonderful 20-minute work which is virtually unknown?Technically, this music is not terribly difficult, but Larrocha's slowly faltering technique make her tempos sound cautious, and interpretively the magic of her previous renditions on London/Decca is missing.Also, RCA's typically hard-toned piano sound is unattractive. This is typical of so many of RCA recordings; I've noticed that the same problem afflicts virtually all of the Rubinstein and Horowitz recordings for this label.Nevertheless, I'm a die-hard fan of this pianist, and I'll keep buying whatever she records."
1,"""Price Guide"" Baloney ! ! !",I'll make this short and sweet. I thought this book would be helpful when going to sportscard shows. I felt I wouldn't have to carry a big book around. But this book is so superficial you are better off just taking the Monthly or Beckett Plus Price Guides. DO NOT waste your money on this book. I returned it to Amazon.
3,Meh,"The Peter and the Wolf part of this CD is great. Bowie is perfect! And of course, the orchestra is spot on. The Britten section frankly, sucks. It's just fragmented with no narration. Waste of space."
4,Good product. Clumsy delivery practices.,"The product itself was fine. Because of your confusing website I wound up ordering it twice. When I ordered it with your one-click system, and then wanted to go back and order something else to go to the same address you dumped me somewhere else. Then there is the always confusing situation where my billing address is one place but I want the product delivered to another place. (I order books and records for my granddaughter and a friend.) Because of this experience plus a book ordered many, many months ago that you just never sent, I avoid Amazon unless there are particulr reasons to use it--and there aren't many.Don Frazier"
1,Very bad;,"These are not like normal windshield wipers. For some reason, the design requires that you insert an unusual piece into the wiper. I tried to follow the instructions, but it did not make sense. In turn, the wipers would not fit on my car.I promptly went to an auto parts store and bought another set (that has the normal connections) and popped it on in 10 seconds.Do yourself a favor and buy another brand (unless, of course, you're an auto repair specialist and can read crude illustrations)."
2,Uneven set,"This is a very uneven set. Heppner is a fine Lohengrin, one of the best around. Sweet, while not the Elsa of one's dream, is better than average. Leiferkus is mediocre and Marton downright bad. Rootering and Terfel are excellent, though. A mixed bag. Look elsewhere!"
4,source of electroplating information!,I got much information specific to analyses of electroplating solution and additives. Experience that world for yourself! thanks!
3,Strapless in Spain,"The money stash worked ok until the adjuster on the strap broke. It kept fully extending and I had to tuck my neck stash in my underware, which really kept everything safe!"
3,A little bulky for my taste,"I bought this neck stash for my trip to Rome, Italy. I only used it once - on the day of my arrival in Rome - for my cash, credit cards and a pen. It looked a little bulky to me - you can notice the protrusion under my long sleeves. I used instead the Eagle Creek leg stash for the rest of my stay in Rome (a week)."
2,Neck stash,GREAT idea but the back pocket tore away @ the seam so I couldn't put anything in the back pocket. Not good in Haiti!!!
5,GREAT for TRAVEl,"I love this product and am so glad I got it for a recent cruise! I could bet this across my body, and it was easy to access and carry all my necessary paperwork in! It helps a passport, money, room key and even some lip balm!"
4,Great item...,It fits more than one thinks. Very discreet and easy to store within your clothing. I would recommend it to the travelling folks.
4,Very useful,"This item is great during travel. Especially getting through the airport and customs. Safely stores items such as passports, etc. and makes them secure while still being easily accessable. I'd reccomend this item to travelers."
5,Terrific item!,"We ordered this for my 11-year-old granddaughter. It arrived quickly (thank goodness!) and is exactly what she needed! Having two zippered compartments and two pockets inside the velcro gives ample space for holding cash, debit cards, passport, and itinerary. It's lightweight enough to wear all day without feeling heavy. Great product!"
4,Satisfied but...,"I bought this travel wallet for a trip to India. It worked well to stash all my most important things: passport, cash, ID, credit cards, hotel key, a small notepad and pen, some tissues, pack of gum, lip balm, and maybe a few other small items. I was really happy with having this small wallet, so I didn't have to carry my normal bulky handbag and risk getting pick-pocketed. And with the option of wearing this ""stash"" under my shirt, I felt extra secure. My only complaint is that one of the side zippers came off the track on day 2 of the trip, rendering one of the side pockets insecure, as it was stuck open. However, I was still able to stuff all I needed into the other compartments, so overall, it was a good investment and served its purpose!"
4,Very convenient and spacious travel pouch,Lots of room in the pouch for just about anything and everything you could want or need to bring on a trip.
5,Lewis N Clark Deluxe Neck Stash,"I used this neck stash on a trip to Mexico and found that I did not have to carry a purse. It was part of me and held everything I needed, Passport, money, ID's, flight tickets. If someone wants to have hands free then this is the way to go.Lewis N. Clark Deluxe Neck Stash"
1,Very disappointed!,I just received two of this item today. It appears that the quality of the zippers is very poor and one of the zipper has been broken and can't close at all. I don't recommend it to anyone.
5,Works great!,This is a great aid traveling.... but you need to wear a loose fitting shirt... it shows veryobviously under t-shirts...
5,Travel safety,This is the type of pouch recommended by TV travel hosts. Bought one for my son for trip to France; VERY HANDY and VERY HIDDEN.RECOMMEND.
5,Worked just as it should,"Took it to Europe and worked great. I was able to not only carry my own passport and money, but after my wife's neck wallet's zipper broke, I carried her passport, money and make up, and could have carried more. I liked the 2 zippered side pockets. They complement the main, divided, top pocket very nicely. It was comfortable to wear."
4,Great for traveling,"Made of durable material, all compartments are completely secure. I tried to adjust it different ways to conceal it beneath my shirt, but you can always tell it's under there. Our friends at the TSA will make you take it off before you go through the scanner, but other than that it is great if you need to have your hands free and go to multiple sites and don't feel like carrying a purse. I will also use it for playing sports and at my job, which is located in a drug infested gutter."
3,OK pouch,It is lightweight and basic. It is comfortable to wear. I wish it has a zippered pocket somewhere for money.
4,A Very Stylish Shoe,"I've always liked Kenneth Cole's shoes but this is the first pair that I've owned. They are very cool looking but for the current style trend (Mar. '08) they are a a little too square in the front. As far as the fit, one of my feet is a little loose, but that's minor and to be expected with slip-ons. Other than the slight slip on the loose shoe, they are pretty comfortable. I don't wear them every day so it's hard to judge wear, but they seem to be very durable. I bought a pair off Nunn-Bush oxfords a month after these and I had been wearing the Coles to work for about two weeks every day with no sign of wear. The Nunn's heels after the next two weeks were visibly worn down already. Overall, a very good shoe."
1,For A Shame,"Even though I ordered ""2"" the first one I got I ware for one day the I notice that the medal part was missing as for the 2nd one the size was all wrong it didn't fit at all I won't recommend it even for an enemy."
4,Remarried with Children,"This is a great book to start with if you are considering blending your family with another due to remarriage. It gives several examples of what could happen, which is great since there were some things that I did not think about before reading this book."
5,one of the best decorating books,"I have a lot of decorating books, and I am not a huge fan of french interior, but this book is great! It is full of photos of classy decorated rooms, the colors are so tastefull and it makes you wanna go and redecorate your place until it looks like the rooms in this book. It is worth having it and I still go back and look at it, beacause it is sooo cool."
1,offensive and deceptive,"This is not really a ""tour guide,"" the author, an NPR commentator, has taken her radio rants and slung them haphazardly into a book. Has some entertainment value, but seems unnecessarily offensive (for example, the cover)."
1,plastic hooks fail to hold up feeder,"the plastic hooks could not hold up my feeder. It crashed to the ground destroying a $100 bird feeder that was performing wonderfully. The design of this dome was working perfectly, but the inferior parts failed.I've since seen other domes with metal hooks. Please checkout those unless you plan to hang a basket ball."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This is JUNK. My backyard squirrels figured out how to get around this in a little less than an hour. It is not big enough or deep enough, so they can out their weight on, slide to edge, and jump or grab onto the feeder.In addition, the 2-piece screw hook comes undone after a few days of hanging. This meant that the feeder fell off the hook and baffle onto the ground. I put it back together, tightened it really good, and tried again. It fell the next day and this time my $15 feeder fell and broke. So not only did this product not work - it cost me $15 to try it, PLUS the trip to 2 stores to find a replacement feeder (I bought 2, so I have a back up now.)Some years ago I got a squirrel baffle that worked for several years (and through all seasons!) - before the metal hook rotted away and it broke. Unfortunately the store that carried it no longer has them. So I am still looking.But I cannot recommend this one unless you want to throw your money away on useless junk."
4,Works for me,"I didn't buy these for squirrel baffles but rather for rain shields. And they've been working great. I hate it when my feeders get all wet and the seed sticks together and turns to mush. Gross. The seed can still get wet if it gets real windy during rain, but not as wet as it would if unprotected. I'm a bit concerned about the longevity of the plastic hanging hooks so I will be making my own out of stainless screw hooks and coupling nuts."
1,A DEFICIENT SQUIRREL BAFFLER,16-inch baffler---too smallplastic-not durable. A GENIOUS SQUIRREL WILL KNOCK IT DOWN AND IT WILL BREAK IN HALF
1,MORE SQUIRRELS THAN EVER,THIS PLACTIC SHIELD HAD TO BE IMPROVISED FOR FIT ON BIRD POLE AND FEEDER. BOTH NOW IN MY GARGAE AS JUNK. TO ANYONE WITH FEEDER AND SQUIRREL PROBLEM USE THE INVERTED POLE BAFFLE CONE THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED ON POLE HEIGHT. MY SQUIRRELS ARE COMPLETELY FRUSTRATED AND HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED FROM FEEDER AND ATTEMPT TO GET AT BIRD FOOD. ONLY A POLE BAFFLE WILL WORK. SQUIRRELS LEARNED TO JUMP ON 340 TRANSPARENT AND GET TO FOOD.
5,Compact and Versatile,"This keyboard is the best accessory to the Samsung Q1 UMPC, together with the organizer. Together, they make the perfect mobile PC. The special function keys on this keyboard allows control of volume, brightness, display toggle. The size is perfect for touch typing."
2,Great product -- not so great price,"Granted, this keyboard was manufactured with the Q1 in mind, but that doesn't justify the price. For $12 or $20, one can get a very portable USB keyboard that works equally well. This keyboard somewhat matches the dimensions of the Q1, so if that's important, buy it. But for much less, one can get a similarly sized USB keyboard from a different manufacturer."
3,this cd is ok,alot of the songs are not good but some of the songs are good like facelift and pretend i'm human and when you lie. people should get this cd but get tragic first.
2,REST IN PEACE O9mm!!!,"The record and mixing got better, but the songs....hmmm, I guess a real guitar player is missing...I'm talking about Chris Traynor, who maked O9mm one of the best band ever.You should hear ""tragic"", a perfect album. ""Driver not included"" is also great. This ""human"" cd has no guitar player. The bass man took control...OK, it's not that bad. Thank's to Chaka Malik with his unbelieveble vocals."
