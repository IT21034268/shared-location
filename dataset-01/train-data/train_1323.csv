5,Awesome,"This album is so awesome! I love JoJo, I love her music, and I especially love the fact that she has made herself very clear and that people are taking her seriously since she is a young new artist. You go girl!"
1,"Bad, JoJo, Bad!","I don;t really listen to her type of music.(I'm a metal-head)Apparenlty she's 13. I've heard her song Get Out(Leave) and I've seen the video for it. *rolls eyes*If this talentless girl was anymore full of herself, she'd explode!! What a waste of money to let her record an album. Her parents should smack themselves for letting her dress like Britney Spears at 13! I shudder and gag violently whenever I see this horrible waste of my hearing abillity.Yep, she's right up there with the others I hate (Avril, Britney, Hillary, Jessica and Ashley, that Rose girl)If you want pop music with talent, check out Maria Mena.Otherwise, you will be brain-washed.Kiss-Kiss- JackSkellingtonsBytchps. I'n not really 12. I'm 16."
1,Another Wannabe ...,"hmm.. give her 2-3 more years & im sure she'll improve. obviously she didnt write any of the songs on her cd. i think the only good songs on her cd are ""leave (get out)"" & ""baby it's you"". & when i heard ""weak"" that got me pissed off. originally by SWV, they made it great, jojo killed it.basically all the songs sound the same. all the 5 star reviews are probably britney spears fans as well & obviously they have bad taste in music. basically this cd is a WASTE OF MONEY"
2,Urgh,"I really liked Leave (Get Out) by Jojo, so I picked up the cd and bought it. When I listened to it though, there are no other songs like it. The rest are all RnB songs where Jojo hardly gets in a word at all! It's all older background singers and the same beat. Disapoints!"
5,Introducing Jojo!!,"Jojo is off the hook!! This album is so amazing and she's the Aaliyah of 2004!! This girl blows on every song and she sounds like she knows what she's talkin about on her debut-self titled album ""Jojo."" I bought this cd is day it came out and I can't stop listening to it. It's addictive. The stand out tracks are ""Not That Kinda Girl"" and ""Leave (Get Out)"" and the other songs as well as ""Weak"" are tight and they are the thing!! Jojo is my #1 artist of 2004!! Buy it, you won't regret it!"
1,Tsk-Tsk!!!,13 year olds singing about love and boyfriends and going on dates. It saddens me what this world is coming to...
1,THE TRUTHS REPLY!,"by dumb kid "" The songs on the c.d. were all good but the best one was #7 (Leave get out) because this is the one song I and every one else can relate to. Most girls will like this c.d. but I don't know about the guys. Also all the fans will be happy with her new c.d.""THE TRUTH: of course you like that song, its her only hit. only girls who dont know talent or who are untalented like this bull""Korn doesn't writes songs that they feel, but JoJo dose""THE TRUTH: its spelt ""does"" stupid kid. and korn writes songs they feel. JOJO DOESN'T EVEN WRITE EXCEPT 1 SONG. SHE SUCKS AND IS A FLOP. AT LEAST KORN WRITES LIKE ALL THEIR STUFF. YOU ARE SO DUMB YOU LITTLE WHITE PIECE OF TRASH WHO DON'T KNOW TALENT. KORN IS WAY BETTER AND SO MUCH MORE TALENTED THAN FAKE MANUFACTURED 1-HIT-WONDER JOJO!"
2,I'll be perfectly happy just downloading a single....,"I definately think she has potential, but I was shocked to learn that she's only 13 ....good grief honey, what did your boyfriend(as portrayed in leave/get out) do anyways? Share a bucket-o-popcorn at the movies with some other girl? OMG! That's like so terrible! It's like worse than what happened with yo mama when your dad slept with his secretary *rolls eyes*"
5,A Wonderful Soultry CD!,"JoJo's CD is wonderful, and I am so glad that I purchased it. This 13-year-old singer's powerful voice will have you blown off your feet. Her soulful lyrics and music defintely make this a one-of-a-kind CD. All of the tracks on her debut CD are wonderful, giving JoJo a great start to her music career. I highly encourage you to purchase this CD, and also to recommend it to your friends to buy. This CD is great!"
1,talentless girl,"don't listen to the good reviews those reviews were made by ones in a online promotional team FOR jojo(pathetic an't it?)i have been around long enough to know a talentless pop act when i see one and jojo is defently talentlessher video for ""leave"" in which she tries to convience the viewer she's done with the guy is extemtly laughable she has terrible acting skillsthe song ""leave"" says the same thing over and over again ""get out until you treat me right""and the rest of the album is just as bad and full of terrible one liners from ricki lakeskip this album and buy christina aguilera at least she can sing"
1,JoJo = Record Company,"Oh, trust me, none of this stuff is actually written by the girl herself. All of this ""music"" is pure, unadulterated record-company goodness.I don't see age as an issue, if she's good enough, she's good enough. Unfortunately, she isn't. And that's why this 13 year old ""girl"" (I prefer to call her a ""front"") is not going to be listened to in say, another year.I shed a tear for everyone who was suckered into buying Jo-""record-company-front-girl""-Jo's album."
4,hilary duff? lindsay lohan? urgh...,"i love to listen to jojo's songs, especially ""not that kinda girl"" and ""leave (get out).""she sounds way better than those teen age girls...you know the blondie whose best almbum just came out(only two albums and one best album? folks, what's the matter with this world?!)"
2,Leave...Get out!,"Very rarely have I came across a cd this bad. Thank goodness she is only 13 yrs old. Perhaps as she gets older, her voice will improve as well. I'm not quite sure what the other people are listening to when they rate this cd so great. Obviously these listeners are young too and their ears haven't really been introduced to great music as of yet. Jojo has a serious lisp in some of her songs. She has a problem with the letter ""s"" at times. Listen very carefully throughout the cd and you will notice it on some of the songs. Better yet...don't purchase this cd and go purchase the Haley Westenra or Joss Stone cd!"
1,HORRIBLE ALBUM!,THE ALBUM IS HORRIBLE! ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME AND SHE IS TALENTLESS! THANK GOD SHE ONLY HAD AND WILL ALWAYS ONLY HAVE 1 HIT! ...THAT 1 SONG WAS ENOUGH!
3,JOJO~~,"When i first heard Jojo's song ""LEAVE(GET OUT)"" i was blown away, i was like wow this gurl is good for a 13/14 yr old, when i heard the rest of her songs they arent as good as i thought, the good songs are: leave, not that kinda girl, and baby it's you . thats about it. Her song ""sunshine"" has alot of screaming on it, she isnt that good with her vocals and i think she should stay away from the hi notes. She is mostly an r&b style singer but she could probably do better if she did fast hip-hop style songs, i dont no about the lyrics, they arent that great either. I was a little disapointed after i heard LEAVE(get out) i thought the other songs were going to be better."
1,What Does JoJo Do With Her Music?,NOTHING! SHE DOES NOTHING WITH HER MUSIC!NO WONDER SHE BECAME A 1-HIT-WONDER!
1,Why The Hate? HERES WHY!,"SHE IS UNTALENTED. SHE DOES NOTHING WITH HER MUSIC! SHE IS OVERRATED! SHE DOESN'T DESERVE! HER VOICE IS JUST DECENT, NOT LIKE A MARIAH!SHE IS A 1-HIT-WONDER ANYWAY...SO GET OVER IT BABIES!BY THE WAY...WE ARE ALSO GOT JEALOUS OF THIS UNTALENTED MANUFACTURED PHONY FAKE 1-HIT-WONDER WANNABE WHITE GIRL WHO HAS NO TALENT AND IS A KIDDIE STAR....WHAT A FLOPPER!"
3,3.5 Stars Some songs are great some not,"JoJo is not 100 percent talentless. She has a good voice but only some of her songs are godd ""Leave (Get Out)"" was a good song. ""Baby It's You"" I didn't care for. She did a great remake of ""Weak"" by SWV. That is probably the best track on this cd. She sounds a lot like Coko from SWV. She has a great singing voice but some of the lyrics to her songs SUCK"
2,"A young talent, yes, but the album is definitely monotonous","Her hit tune ""Leave, Get Out"" is the best song on the album.The rest of the album is not as refreshing. At first thehip hop loops and samples and the heavy bass mix delude youinto thinking these are hot tracks, but if you listen repeated-ly you will soon tire of them and find them too predictable.JoJo is a gifted young vocalist, but on this outing, she doesstart to deliver the same vocal riffs over and over, and yourealize it's more about vocal acrobatics than deliveringreal song expression or sensitivity. Hopefully her producerswill freshen up her approach on the next album. And her hip hop language is a little ludicrous for her age. It makes the songs sound silly after awhile."
2,"Sorry, JoJo!","Why shouldn't you like JoJo? She's young, and talented, right? Well, I'll tell you why I don't like her. Actually, I like her, I'm just not fond of this album. I wouldn't spend my allowance on it. ""Leave (Get Out)"" is a really good song! It's on my list of favorites. But JoJo's other songs are duds, from what I've listened to. They're slow and boring. They definately don't match up with ""Leave (Get Out)"".(...)"
4,JOJO,"I totally think JoJo is a really good singer. I know that people think she is singing about things that are over her head, but I know that everyone is doing things younger. There are people that have boyfriends at 11! But the content isn't an issue to me. It's about the singing, and how good the quality of that is. JoJo is hot!"
2,"Good Voice, but ...","Jojo's voice is rather mature for her age, and as stated by others, I think she does have talent among other teen stars. However, I agree with those who think her lyrics are too mature for her. Sadly, though, a lot of 13 or 14 year olds in my school seem to be experts in relationships as well. America's youth is trying to grow up way too fast, and I should know, because I am only a few months shy of being 14 myself.It's a sad reality, but to most her own age, Jojo DOES represent them and sing about what they experience. I don't agree with it, but thats just how it is."
1,mistake a review from kevin f,i really thought jojo would of been a really good singer and she has a good single called leave get out that is a good song but this cd sucks i but this cd for the wrong reason
5,JoJo's album review,I think JoJo can really sing. She is only 14 and that is amazing! I've been singing since i was 3 and i'm 13 now but can't get nobody to listen so good for her. i love every song and she seems so nice that you have to like her!!!!!!!!!!! I love JoJo!!!!!!!!!!she makes everything original.
5,"GoGo, JoJo!!!!!!","JoJo is by far the most talented singer I have heard for a while, and considering she is only 13 years old, she is sure to be a big hit for years to come! My all-time favorite song is Get Out (Leave) by guess who?. . . JoJo!!! I am sure to be a big fan of hers forever!"
4,Very Good Album!!,"Yes she is young and shouldn't being singing about the stuff she's singing about but this girl can sing. And I myself am a 24 yr old who found this album to very good considering I'm an R&B fan, I was very happy to hear that this album was not pop. She has a voice stronger than a lot of the female artists out there today. So just because she's a kid doesn't mean she can't sing. Let's just hope she doesn't turn out like little Brittany."
5,I like it,I like this album. and plan to buy her yet to be released album thats supposed to be released in Spring of 2006. I love this one. All the songs are catchy to me.Waiting for the next album!
1,Fake young idiot!!!,"Looking for a young prodigy,look up somebody decent like american idol person... she is pathetic.l.. she sounds awful on every song and she screams so much@!!!! ewwwww"
4,~*~I WANT THIS CD!!~*~,"I absolutely LOVE the single ""Leave (Get Out)"" !! It is so totally awesome and JoJo has a great voice to sing it with. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe that this was a thirteen-year-old! She has such talent!! Now I want this CD!! I watched all the videos, and listened to all the song samples and everything, so now all I need to do is BUY THE CD!! I would like to buy this along with ""This Is My Time"" (Raven-Symone). The only reason why I'm not giving this CD 5 stars is because I don't actually own it, so I don't know what all the songs are like..."
5,This girl can SING!!!,"It's not bad for a 13 year old white girl!!! She's better than Hilary Duff!!She's so mature for her age and her voice is mature,too!! It includes pop,r&b,hip-hop,soul,etc. Buy NOW!!!"
1,Horrible...Just another wannabe,"I saw all the great reviews on this site about JoJo and was excited to buy her CD. Big mistake! I just wasted valuble money on a trashy, worthless cd. Jojo has little singing talent, no stage appeal, little difference in all her songs and overall a non-entertaining cd. I understand that she's ""only 13"". 13 or 30, (...)"
1,WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?,This singer is terrible. Who told her she was a good singer? Why does she try to act older than her age?
1,This is what Diarrhea sounds like,"You know the sound of a really bad diarrhea splashing into the toilet? Well, that sound has been recorded and issued on CD. This is it."
1,JoJo: One Hit Wonder! Duh!,"I can't believe she is still around. She had one hit! Get over it! Now she is is trying to milk it for all it is worth. No offense, but I think that maybe she should go back to school, and maybe come out later when she has better material to offer!(...)"
1,NO TALENT,JOJO has no talent. She's just a money making scheme. Her songwriting skills are _______________. When I listen to her songs on MTV I feel as if I can re write her lyrics to make her a bigger success..Cmon dont buy this stuff!
5,JOJO's CD IS HOT,"This cd is very good... Outstanding vocals and originality... IF you havent bought it, go out and get it.... you wont regret it..."
1,UHH........ this is poo LOL,"this cd is awful, although her voice is good for her age but some of the songs are over her head and some of them are too young for her.. but heres the thing u know the band hanson well i know alot of ppl dont like them but thats not my point. my point is there ages when they first started was like 11, 13, and 15? i think and they wrote most of their songs and played their instruments and here we have a 13 year old who writes one of her songs and sings ALRIGHT and a bunch of people are like "" she's only 13?"" uh ya she sounds 13 and u can tell by the songs she is. I just think she is highly overrated and i am tired of hearing leave get out the song is stupid her ex must have let a another girl wear his letterman jacket or have a drink of his coke because boy did she sound mad bout it...lol..... the best song on this cd is the one she wrote i hope she doesnt come out with a second cd but if she does good luck with it hope it is better than this one ......"
1,Sucks,"She can't sing she sucks so bad, she is has no singing voice and she needs to leave SWV alone don't waste your money you will be very upset!!!!"
1,She's a winner!!!,she deserves these grammys:Worst Pop Vocal Performance - Trans (Leave-Get Out)Worst Pop Collaboration with Brats (Baby it's you feat. Bow (Da Bitch) Wow)Worst Stupip Song (The Happy Song)Worst Pop Vocal Album (JoJo)Worst New Artist
4,My thoughts,"Jojo is doin it real big rite now.The album is sikk...dis girl gotz vokalz.If I had to choose my top 5 songs from her album it would be numbers 1,5,6,9 and 14. The girls young and has crazy talent."
1,DID ANYONE NOTICE,"i dont get it but these kids ignore talent and don't realize that their favorite stars are all hasbeens, which is why there on disney only! she blows and since her career is over, i think amazon should take her off their website!"
1,JoJo is a HoHo ....her cd is Retarded ..everything suxxx !!!,"""Leave"" get out is the ONLY good song on her album everything esle is just trash.....plus all of her songs sound the same....i would tell people to just burn it or not buy it at all it is the WORST album Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!JOJO SUXX!!!!!!!"
5,Jo Jo's Awesome Review,i thought JoJo's cd was great! She is only 14 with that kind of talent. it is amazing. I love every song on her album and to think she wrote 3 of her own songs. It takes a lot of talent to do what she does. She is also very beautiful.
5,this is awesome,omg jojo's cd is awesome. i really liked it. all day i listened to it. i know almost alla the songs now. haha. well just wanted to tell everyone that you should go out and buy it or just go to walmart and listen to it tht way. you'll rly like it. to alla my ppl on jojo's i-squad- whats up! this is danielle1008.
5,JoJo is awesome,This cd is awesome i think everyone will love not only teens and tweens but adults too!! actually I'm listening to it now on my computer my dad bought it for me yesterday when it came out because he knows i absolutely love her music she is my inspiration to continue writing music and searching for a record company to sign me. So look out world here I come and all thanks to JoJo!!
5,Quite a Voice; Style,"This girl has quite a voice and stage presence for being so very young. I am impressed.At first I was a little wary of her because of her age, but she is really good. Sounds a lot like Aaliyah. If you like Beyonce and Aaliyah, you'll probably like JoJo's album. She's a talented girl despite the fact that she is only 13 and singing about a boy cheating on her! Though I am sure other people pick the songs she sings.. so it's not her fault."
1,lame,"wow just another watered down teeny bopper....a white little teeny bopper girl on a record label called blackground who wants to work with dr.dre. The lyrics are stupid and she's only 13 and said she helped write them too. ""get out, right now, right, it's the end of you and me, you say that you would treat me right, but you was just a waste of time"". she's 13 for goodness sake, THIRTEEN and singing like she's been in a lifetime of relation ships when she's just barely older than a 12 year old. holy shiza, even I haven't gone through so much experience that this little girl has....she sure is one to look up to. It's all the little teeny and kiddie boppers that will rate this high."
5,JoJo,JoJo's album is absoulutley amazing. She is soo young and has much more potential then any other artist out. Her vocals on this album are outstanding. Im very impressed.
5,I LUV THIS CD!,I TOTALLY LUV THIS CD ITS SOOO GOOD:)!! i think everyone shuld buy it! the songs are great and shes absolutley gorgeous and she can REALLy and i mean REALLy sing:)!
5,Amazing,Jojo is soooo talented. I can't beleive she is only 13. first hearing her voice i thought she was atleast 16. Jojo better go really far because her voice is sooo amazing
5,The coolest cd!,This is such a cool cd! I rate all the songs 5/5. they have a good beat and nice lyrics.
5,Gotta Give JoJo Her Props,"First, let me say that I am 27, and the fact she was 13 didn't really deterr me, cuz I'll allow anyone one of any age their due if they are talented, and from the first single (Leave), I knew she was good. I bought the album for my niece and something told me to get a copy for myself and I am SO glad that I did. Her vocals are gret, the fact that she wrote some of the songs herself is wonderful (and hopefully she can do more on her next project) but definitely a surprise that such a strong voice and range that's great for an R&B edge coming from such a young person. And I'm equally glad she's from Mass, cuz so am I!Do your thang girl!"
5,Beyond Words,"Words can't really describe how extremely telented JoJo really is. It's hard to believe that she's only 14. I can't wait for her second album because she'll be even better. But this a formidable start to her recording career. While I agree that the songs could have been better and don't necessairly reflct the true nature of her youth, it's not a waste of her time or talent. There are many potential hits for her on this record. I would encourage people to have an open mind and give JoJo a chance. She deserves it.1. Breezy 10/102. Baby It's You 10/103. Not That Kind Of Girl 10/104. The Happy Song 10/105. Homeboy 10/106. City Lights 9/107. Leave (Get Out) 10/108. Use My Shoulder 10/109. Never Say Goodbye 8/1010. Weak 8/1011. Keep On Keepin' On 10/1012. Sunshine 9/1013. Yes or No 10/1014. Fairy Tales 8/10"
2,Jo Jo...So So,"Now this is just my opinion, but the only song I like is Leave (Get Out). I think the rest of her songs suck, to be perfectly honest with you. Also about this age thing, when I first saw her, I thought she was 18-20 years old. When my friend told me she was only 13, I was shocked."
3,"Good voice, but...","Jojo has a good voice, but I do agree that she is singing material that is too mature for her. She should wait a couple years, and maybe make a comeback. ""Leave"" and ""Never Say Goodbye"" are the best two on the CD, IMHO."
4,She is telented,"Jojo shows us that there is more to pop music than Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. While their music is O.K at times, it is very disposible. I see Jojo being around in many years. Her first single ""Leave"" is a very mature song for the 13 year old. Her followup hit ""Baby It's You"" has equal power. I think that she has what it takes to make it."
4,This girl can blow and I mean that in a good way of course,"(...)Jojo is the real deal.Her debut album is a mix of R&B/Hip hop and pop but this album sounds a bit mostly R&B.Tracks that are worth listening too are Baby It's you(Unfortunately Bow Wow is not featured in the album version),Leave(Get Out)an anthem for young girls out there about their boyfriends cheating on them,Weak a remake of the Female R&B Group 1993 #1 Hit which sounds almost pretty much the same as the original but Jojo still makes it a great track worth listening too.Other great tracks include City Lights(A Club Banger so to speak but isn't she a bit young to be going to clubs)Never Gonna Say Goodbye,great ballad about discovering and falling in love for the first time.Jojo is defitnitely a superstar on the rise and I wish a lot of a success she has an amazing voice and Highly Recommend this album to anybody little kids,teenagers,and adults you'll really enjoy it I give 4 out of stars"
5,JoJo's album,"Jojo's album is amazing and is very unique. I love it, I felt like I could relate to a ton of her songs. She is such an amazing artist at only 13! This album shows you who she is and her opinion on life. She deserves the five stars I gave her because she has so much talent and potetial. This album was defiantley a GREAT start to her career. JOJO ROCKS!!"
5,awesome CD,"Jojo is full of talent. Don't let her young age full you, she has a voice of a woman. She's pure talent. Her first single ""leave (get out)"" is one of the top singles out, I think anyone who buys her cd will love it!"
5,I LOVE JOJO!,"JoJo is such a great, talented, and unique singer. I respect her so much, she has a tremendous amount of talent. I bought her self-titled CD the day it came out (6-22-04) and I love it."
4,Homegirl has some pipes,"For such a tiny lil girl she can str8 up sang. So talented and so young I'm excited of things to come. Unlike some artists these days she has soul,depth and power in her voice. I think she could even join LeAnn,Alicia and Xtina in the club of best new artist Grammy winner."
3,Good basic primer,"Nicely written, a couple good pointers, but overall - nothing I didn't already know. Did give me a little more confidence since, apparently, I'm not as clueless as I thought."
5,Share this with your guy! ;),Excellently written. Informative without being overly graphic or embarassing. A must for women who are new to this. And a wonderful book to share with your guy.
5,I love Sadie Allison!,"This is a great book for all my friends and family who have said to me, ""I would never do that"" or ""I have never had an orgasm. This book breaks down all the myths and all the judgements. Plus gives you some very great tips and techniques. It is well written, and easy to read! Thank goodness for Sadie Allison."
3,"Fine, but nothing great","It's a fine book, but only slightly better than you'd get out of reading a year of cosmo"
5,Better than Basic!,"Thank you Sadie! I'm kinda new to personal pleasure, and didn't know how to get the ""o"". Growing up, I was told not to touch myself. It kinda made me timid about sexuality as a whole. But... this book taught me all the ""skills"" I needed! It's like having an educated older sister! Thank God such a valuable resource exists! Women like me just need a starting point! :) I've since read all Sadie's books. My sex life has never been better! :)"
3,a tickle is all you'll get,"I ordered this book hoping to find something 'new' about self-love. That was not the case. The book spends a lot of time telling an audience that is probably largely made up of grown women that have previously performed 'self-love' about how its healthy, the female anatomy,what an orgasm is, and many basic techniques that I and probably many other women have discovered on their own. It may be good for a young teenage girl that's curious about masturbation, but its really not a find for a woman looking for new techniques to enhance her experience. Save your money, and search the net instead."
4,Easy to read and use,Great for beginners and as a refresher course for those who have been neglecting themselves. It isn't one of those books that advanced users will enjoy because it really seems geared more towards novices. But it's a very easy read and the illustrations are helpful.
4,New Experience,This book was a wonderful first guide to ever womens need to have control thier desires. It made me wanna learn more.
3,"Not the ""large"" stool","I ordered the white stool and the one I received was not the ""large"" model which is suppose to measure 7.5 inches in height. The one I received was the smaller version measuring 5.5 inches (height of seat). Otherwise, as expected, but I returned it since it was too short."
3,"It does the job, but cheesy leather...","It does the job, but the leather looks and feels like plastic. I imagine with wear, the black ""finish"" on the leather will look pretty crappy. The real sheepskin padding is nice."
4,Good product,"Nice, robust product and easy to install. however, the drill bit that comes with it is smaller than the screws, and there are no pegs included. Good product overall"
5,Land of Little Rain,This book was about the desert and desert people which Austin knows well. Her language is beautiful. I purchased as a gift book for people who love the Southwest and the people.
4,Mary Austin,I used to live write down the street from Mary Austin's old house in the Owen's Valley. I found her life very interesting and maybe from reading this book you get more of an inside on what her life was like.
4,Interesting Read,"I chose this book as it describes Death Valley and surrounds in the US and as I had been there thought it might provide a little more in depth information about the area. She writes delightfully about flora, fauna and nature's way, however, I got a little bogged down two thirds of the way in with almost unlimited descriptions of flora - perhaps someone with this background would find it fascinating - anyhow I soldiered on and found the remainder of the book very good, particularly the native indian tribe's customs and ways. Recommended...."
5,Best natural history writing,"Austin lived in the Owens Valley during a turbulent period at the turn of the century, and she observes the people and wild things dwelling there with a novelist's eye. But what sets this gem above all the rest is simply her writing, the plain beauty of her voice and phrasing. She achieves a tone that is somehow at once wistful and tinged with levity, very gently ironic yet always loving. Her words caress their subjects like -- well, like the pen and ink drawings that graced the original publication in 19-ought-whatever. They evoke all the richness of the place, its austerity, its pathos, its beauty, with a gentle affection that is sweet but never cloying, sometimes sad but never downcast. It has a kind of Zen translucency, filtered through the gently humorous, sensitive lens of a literary genius."
3,The land of little rain,The book was hard to read but I enjoyed it. I now have a greater appreciation for the people who were able to live in that environment.
5,"Drum, Chavi, Drum Delightful & refreshingly educational",I loved this book & the children I have read it to became instantly enamored with the character Chavi.Mayra Dole talent & ability to express & to share so many aspects of her culture is evident here. She weaves many values in this fun & delightful book where the irresitable Chavi shares her world with us.The Illustrations reflect the color & authenticity of Miami's Cuban life. A captivating character & story.
2,Disappointed. Not what I expected.,"The item is very small. The football piece is actually just a rattle. The baseball piece doesn't function well. I expected a toy that my son could really interact with. I got a toy he can put a ball in the hoop and listen to the crowd cheer. That's it. I don't know exactly what I expected. But, more than what I got!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this toy for my 1 year old boy. He had more fun playing with the box it came in, than the toy itself. We are big football fans, and I thought it was really cool to have a toy with a football, but it is only a rattle. And it is not even a rattle that he can hold. It just spins..thats it. The baseball is too hard to spin around, and the sound effects, when a ball is put through the hoop is very annoying. There are so many toys out there, for $30.00, that are much nicer than this one. Don't be disappointed too."
2,Not much to it:(,"A friend gave this to my now 9 month old as a gift. He pulls the net area and it tips towards him. The football is just a rattle to spin. the bat and baseball might as well not even be there. When he drops the ball through the net, it makes cheering noises and adds points on the score board. After 3 dunks, he's off to the next toy."
2,It's a lot smaller than it looks,"The basketballs and baseball are about the size of a tangerine and the top of the hoop is barely over my kneecaps. I guess this toy is meant for the really young ones. Once they can walk, this toy has limited entertainment value. It's so short, that even my 2 year old has to get on her knees to play with it. We've had it for about a week and it holds her attention for only about 2 minutes per day, tops. I'm no expert, but besides learning how to put a ball into a hole, I don't see much educational value in this toy either."
2,Never Worked - baby never knew Difference,"Looked fun for my 11-month old daughter, however when I plugged in the batteries, there was no power. I thought batteries might have been dysfunctional so I bought another set and brand of batteries. Still nothing. My wife got it to make one slight noise when she pushed on the batteries with the back open and exposed, but whatever electronic features this product has, I have never seen work other than what sounded like a last grasp of breath. Luckily, my daughter never knew the difference and plays with it anyway, likes to walk laps around it holding on and the product never tilted or fell over, so it is durable.I didn't bother to exchange/return."
4,sports center,I bought this for my twin grandchildren. I have not seen them play with it yet but my son said they are having a good time with it.They are only 20 months old so will enjoy it more as they get older I think.
2,Not very entertaining,I bought this for my son for Christmas. So far he has spun the football a couple of times and laughed. Other then that he has no interest. He would rather play basketball with his flimsy nerf hoop then this thing. He is 18 months old and I really thought he would like it but he really doesn't. Plus you can hardly hear the music it plays.
2,Falls Apart,"I purchased this toy for my 9 month old. He seems to enjoy the rattle football and the counting when the basketball goes through the hoop. Two problems, I am missing a basketball and the hoop falls off when he just reaches out to hold on. It is not sturdy and I now have him play without the hoop attached!"
1,ARM STUCK,"My 3 year old got his arm stuck in this toy, it cut his skin and we had to have the fire department come to our house. This toy is dangerous."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"Terrible Customer Service. My son received the Little Tikes Little Champs Sports Center as a gift. After putting it together, I realized there was a ball missing. I contacted Customer Service and they told me that they would have to replace the entire thing but my best bet would be to return it to the store. I explained to the CR Rep that I already put the whole thing together and that it was a gift and therefore I would not be able to return it without a receipt. CR Rep told me well she would need a receipt as well. All this to replace a tiny 3-inch ball? I had much bigger and more expensive things replace from other companies without question. I am VERY disappointed in Little Tikes Customer Service. Not worth purchasing!!!"
2,much smaller than expected,"I came across this toy during a search for outside toddler toys. I have very active 14 month old triplet boys, and I am looking for thing that they can play with/on together. I would recommend this toy for a 6-12 month single child, rather than 6-36 months. The item description indicates that children can play together, it's two small to allow enough wiggle room for that."
2,Too Loud!,"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. I thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles. Unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is SO LOUD! It scares him everytime I turn it on and there is no way to control the volume. I know lots of kid toys are loud, but I have never heard one as loud as this one."
2,head stuck,my daughter is 7 months and loves this toy- i don't turn the sound on because i can't stand it. however today she GOT HER HEAD STUCK between the basketball piece and the football uprights. i have no clue how she did it but i had to break it apart to get her free. but she still loves the basketball part. but now i won't let her us it without me sitting right next to her.
3,"Samba, Samba, Samba...","A very good start to understanding the lure of Samba in Brazil. It will open your ears and eventually your eyes to the simple reasons that so many of us ""gringos"" head South for Carnival, New Year's Eve, Summer, or for the weekend. This albumn is truly Brasil. Valeu!"
2,Not for everyone,"This book has beautiful illustrations that would be interesting to many young children. Unfortunately, there are 2 things about this book that make it unsuitable in many settings. First, the text is written at an advanced level.Few young children could read or understand it. And while older children (12 plus) might get through the text,I think the overall approach and tenor would feel too young for them. So there's mismatch between content and reading level.The other problem comes from the repeated references to God's plan in the story of reproduction. (""God watches and cares for each tiny embryo as it moves and develops inside its mother."") This heavy religious context would be acceptable in some church settings and some homes, but does not seem appropriate in public school or childcare settings."
3,snazy,"Stuck in nuetral was pretty much about a child who that is dissabeld and had sarebral pawlsy and his brain works, but no one knows it except him. And none of his body parts work right. I liked it."
5,A boy named Shawn McDaniel,"Stuck in Neutral is an exciting book that I enjoyed reading its about a 14 year old boy named Shawn McDaniel. Hes stuck in his wheel chair because hes parelized from head to toe, whenpeople talk to him they think he can't understand them because he his brain doesn't function as well. Shawns life is in danger because he think his father is planning to kill him. His father knows he is suffering and hes trying help because he doesn't what his to go through anymore pain. In this novel the characters and the action of the book, you can really imagine what is going on throughout the story of Shawn's experience with all of the problems he goes through even with his father. He thinks god gave him a gift which was that he can remember exactly what the person said on that day and how their voices sound like."
4,Ending?,"This is a great book. It keeps you thinking the whole time and has amazing details and descriptions. It's not trying to persuade you to have pity on the disabled, but, rather, to think about them, and how they might feel, even if you cant tell.When I finished the book, I thought my book was missing the last chapter. I hated how it didn't tell you what happened at the end. In my opinion, there's no point in spending the time reading a book in which you have to write the ending yourself. When I tried to do so, I couldn't stop switching back and forth. Eventually, I, of course, chose the happy ending. I think books should teach us that real life doesn't always have happy endings. I think Terry Trueman should have told us what happened at the end."
3,Stuck in Neutral Review,"In the book Stuck in Neutral is about a boy named Shawn who has cerebral palsy and he can remeber everything everyone has said. He can not communicate with his family in any way, he can't even move. His dad doesn't know how Shawn is feeling or what he is trying to say to him, so he leaves Shawn, his mom, his sister Cindy, and his brother Paul, and they are left with the job of taking care of Shawn. His dad will come around every once and a while to see how they are doing, but every time he see's Shawn have seizure he feels so sorry for him. When really Shawn is having a lot of fun and freedom.I would recomend this book for people that are more mature then most people because it talks about stuff kids would not get or would thin it was funny."
4,A awesome book called Stuck in Neuttral,"I beleive Stuck in Neutral is a great book! A short summary of what happens in this story is there is a little boy named Shawn who had ceribral palzie and it looks like he is telling the story but really he cant talk or anything but the story is telling from what he is thinking. Sean gets the feeling his dad wants to kill him throughout the story, and later on his dad goes on a talk show because he is writing a story on a man who got locked up for killing his son who had the same thing which makes Shawn really think he is going to kill him. I recomend this book for anybody who thinks they are mature, i say that because during this story you will find many cuss words and words little childeren or someone imature might not fill comfortable or be able to handle. Does Shawn's dad really want to kill his son? Read this great book and find out!"
4,I like cheese,"I would definitely recommend this book. It had some fast and exciting parts in it, and some sad and slow parts, too. It also had a lot of suspense. I liked it a lot how the book was written in first person. The speech that Shawn's father gave at the Alice Pond's Show was well written, too. But what I liked was the last three chapters of the book. I liked how the author summed everything up. He showed how much they really loved each other; especially how much Shawn's father loves Shawn. Whether his father ended up ending Shawn's pain, we don't know. But what ever he did, at least we know he did it out of love."
3,Good Product....Slow Shipping,"Product was as described in excellent condition. However, I paid for the premium expedited shipping and received it 9 days later. Longer than it would have taken regular mail from previous experience. Skip any shipping upgrades here. Otherwise okay."
2,Oh...,"In my standards of reading I think this book was not a page-turner even though it won a Michael L. Printz Award. I would not recommend this book to others. The reasons why I would not recommend this is that the problem isn't really that believable, because I really don't believe someone would be that crazy enough to get rid of their own son. In my point of view I thought the book was very morbid and morose. My experience reading this book I thought the plot moved too slowly. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this book a 2."
2,ok book,stuck in neutral i did not like this book all tht much but its about a 12 year old boy named shawn who has cerebral pausy and he cant control his body at all and his dad left him when he was younger and he wrote a poem about shawn and he got rich and famouse and shawn lives with his older brother sister and his mom
2,A very weird and challenging book,"The book I read was called ""Stuck in Neutral"". It is about a boynamed Shawn McDaniel. His parents got divorced when he was a baby because his father couldn't handle his condition. Shawn has a conditionWhere he cannot control any of his muscles, but he can remember anything he heres word for word. The only thing that he can do is sit there and drool.His father doesn't like him because his dad says that he is better off getting put out of his misery. Do we know what will happen to Shawn? You will have to read it and find out. Some parts of the books that I liked where that he had an imagination and he did not let his disability bring him down.Some parts of the book that I didn't like were where it said that he didn't do anything but slobber, it grossed me out. Overall it was an alright book."
2,Good book but don't waste your time,"The book Stuck in Neutral by Terry Trueman was a great book. The story was good and well thought out, I did not like the ending however. Throughout the book you are wondering if the father will kill the son and you never find that out. It felt like I was wasting my time in reading this book. So if you need a resolution at the end of your stories I do not suggest this book."
4,terrifying to think about,"I find the situation that Terry Trueman presents horrifying. To be stuck in a body that cannot talk or focus, cannot even move in a controlled manner- a body that can only listen. This is the body of a boy who has a functioning brain, who has feelings, who wants more than anything in the world to communicate with other human beings (namely his family) and tell them that he is alive and he understands and he hears them when they talk about him being retarded. This is a boy who longs to be accepted, who knows exactly what is going on but cannot react..... a gripping tale about a boy who's own father wants to kill him because he thinks that his son is in pain"
3,"18 year old, NEHI Student","In the book,Stuck In Neutral, by Terry Trueman, the main character is Shawn McDaniel. Shawn was born with cerebral palsy so severe that his body has no muscle control whatsoever. He lives at home with his mother and sister, but his father is only a visitor since his parents are divorced. Unknown to everyone around Shawn, he has an extremely, incredable memory.Shawn fears that his father wants to kill him. Shawn has some very upsetting experiences while with his father. Shawn's father feels that his son suffers a lot of pain and misery. He expresses these feelings through Pulitzer prize winning poems that he has written and read to Shawn.The book was fairly good except the ending left me hanging. They never revealed whether or not Shawn's father actually did kill him. I give this book three stars."
1,Miss!,"I hate this book. I had to read this book for school and it was borring. This book is at a second grade reading level and we're in seventh grade. This book is horribe, don't read it"
2,ahhhhhhh,I don't really like this book a lot. First of all it has a lot of bad words. Second of all it talks about girls and breasts. And it has a unknown ending. I don't want to spend 6 more dollars on another book just to find the end
5,Fabulous Suspense Novel,"This is the best suspense novel I have ever read! I couldn't put it down. Author, Terry Trueman, is brilliant!"
4,Stuck in neutral,"Stuck in Neutral, by Terry Trueman, is a book about a kid named Shawn McDaniel. Shawn is a 14-year old kid who is fully paralyzed. Although he can't move or talk, Shawn is intelligent. He can remember anything he hears without meaning to remember it.Shawn has a bad relationship with his dad who is a poet who has gotten famous by writing about Shawn. His dad divorced his mom because of his condition. His dad also wants to kill him because he thinks that he is suffering.This is a thrill to read and a really good book."
5,"STUCK IN NEUTRAL poses a ""what-if"" that will stay with me.","""If my dad walked into my room right now and killed me, no one would ever know what I was really like. I want to love someone, and feel loved in return, for my real self. What if someone loved me enough to somehow break through and discover that I'm inside this body?""***STUCK IN NEUTRAL is a book that will stay with me. I will never look at the Life Skills kids in my school the same. Terry Trueman's story pulled me into Shawn's world-- and ultimately opened my mind about people that I am just as guilty of ignoring as Shawn's family is. What an amazing, amazing, powerful read. Should be required reading in high school."
5,Stuck In Neutral,"Shawn talks about how he has Cp. He always gets seizures and his dad cant stand looking at him so he leaves the family. Shawn thinks that his dad is trying to kill him. Shawn's dad talks about him on the Pond Show. Shawn is good at remembering everything he hears, but people think he is dumb.Stuck in Neutral was an interesting book. It shows me how handicap people actually can do things that nobody notices. I like it because he talk from his point of view. Shawn shouldnt think his dad wants to kill him, but he just wants to help."
4,Great Book,"A 14-year-old name Shawn who has cerebral palsy, becuase of that he can't control anything of his body and is stuck in a wheel chair. He also has bad seizures which his dad thinks it's hurting him but it's really not. And because of that, he thinks that his dad wants too kill him.I like this book a lot, the author knows how to write just like a teenager and makes you understand well. It also makes you feel what it's like to have his conditions and know how he feels. It's a must read book!"
3,Stuck in Neutral,I really didn't like this book. It didn't catch my attention and I didn't care much for the ending. I did enjoy how this book took me into a mind of a Mentally Challenged kid. It helped me understand what their parents and them are going through. My favorite part of the book is when Shawn is telling a story about his brother being so protective of him. It kind of reminded me of my brother. I liked how this book explained how they think and so I give this book 3 stars.
4,christians review,"Shawn McDaniels is one of the brightest 14 years olds ever. Everything he says, hears, or reads is imprinted in his memory eternally. Although he has a photographic memory, he is considered a retard because of his cerebral palsy. He cannot move any of his body because of this . On top of his impairment, his father's out to kill him. As readers join him they jump into the mind of a hidden prodigy and see what life is like though his eyes.Terry Trueman's Stuck in Neutral is a twist on the idea of the vegetative state theory. His writing is a brand new frontier of paperback exploration, and his ability to tell stories is simple and fun to read. This fast read is not for the weak hearted, but it's worth readers time."
2,The Neutral Boy with a Crazy Mind,"The book wasn't really a page-turner it was more of a life lesson, because nothingexcited because of Shawn's immobility. It wasn't hard to concentrate on the book, but Icouldn't get into the book. I like the style of writing and how the author thinks aboutwhat mentally retarded people are capable of doing. The book was pretty boring becauseof Shawn's condition and my mind occasionally started to wander. The plot wassomewhat believable because I think maybe mentally retarded people can do things likeShawn even though it looks like they can't do anything. I think anybody who has arelation to a mentally retarded person would enjoy this book because they can relate tohow the family feels. I would like to give this author another shot to see if he writesanything captivating."
2,A book without plot,"First they invented the boneless chicken; now we have the plot-less book. I feel like the absolute Grinch That Stole Christmas criticizing a book that was written with such obviously good intentions, and that offers genuine insight into the plight of a person with cerebral palsy. And, to be fair, the main character is likeable, believable, and three-dimensional. But there is virtually no story. Maybe that's the point--how much story can there be for a kid with no actual contact with other people? There is no resolution, huh? Well, maybe so, but the book left me feeling frustrated by its rambling, pointless structure."
4,The review to Stuck in Neutral,"I thought the book Stuck In Neutral was a OK book. To review on it, it was about boy named shawn who has a disorder that does not let him speak very well. Shawn has a brother named paul,a sister named cindy,and he has a mom. He also has a dad, but he lives somewhere else cause he couldn't take seeing his boy in pain. His dad has his own talk show. His dad wrote a poem about shawn and the whole family that got him award.... So it was kinda a scary ending."
5,A great book for all teens and adults,"This book was great! It was very easy to follow and not once did I want to put this book down. This book really makes you think, because, of the things Sean says makes you wonder if all handicap people think like him and are as smart as him. Sean is fourteen years old and is handicap. He can't move or talk but he thinks, he thinks more logical then any other teenager. Sean is afraid that his Dad is planning on killing him. Is he? And if he is will he be able to kill Sean? Find out when you read Stuck In Neutral."
3,take the bad with the good,"A compelling book only because as one editorial review put it, it evokes ""one of our darkest fears and deepest hopes-that a fully conscious and intelligent being may be hidden within such a broken body, as yet unable to declare his existence.""But the plot was lame--VERY lame. It starts off on an interesting premise, but the author's clumsy emphasis on how Shawn's father intends to kill Shawn becomes overkill, especially when you reach the ending and find that--hey, you don't find out anything! It wasn't an ""Ooh, Trueman skillfully let some threads dangle"" but a complete copout. It was actually kind of corny.Maybe the kids of the age that this book was intended for won't realize this, & thus won't be let down. Let's hope."
3,coles review,"The book Stuck in Neutral by Terry Trueman is about a boy, Shawn McDaniel, who has cerebral palsy. He cannot move his entire body; he only can use his involuntary muscles, and is in a wheel chair. He has a lot of seizures and seems to leave his own body. To everyone else he doesn't seem smart but really he is; he remembers everything that has been said and done since he was four. His father thinks his seizures hurt, but really Shawn feels free when these happen. Because of how his father feels about his seizures, Shawn believes that his father is going to kill him.This book makes you feel many emotions and people who read this will think about some one they know or have seen with a disability. The characters are great; they all fit in place. The plot of this book is perfect; Shawn has tasteful and enchanting vocabulary as he tells about his life. All middle school kids should read this book because, it lets you know about what a disabled kid is thinking."
5,it touched me.......,"because I have a sister with special needs. My sister doesn't speak and neither did our hero. He is trying to bond with his father who apparantly cannot handle his special needs. Even though I'm only 13, I can see how he feels. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in learning how it feels to not be able to communicate."
4,Literature Circles,"A group of four college students interested in special education thought this was an overall a good, quick read. It had many meaningful issues and gave a good perspective of what it would be like to have a significant disabiltiy. Imagine being a teenager who literally has no choice or control in his life. How would you feel about getting up and starting each day? Would you want to continue on, or have someone put an end to your pain? While reading this book you really develop a connection to Shawn and his family. You feel for each individual and can side with each emotion. As a whole this group is waiting for the sequel in order to feel closure to this story."
4,My review,"""Stuck In Neutral"" is about a teenager who is paralyzed and is stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. His father left the family because he couldnt stand to see his kid ""suffering."" He visits every once in a while. Now he thinks his dad is planning to kill him because his dad wants togo onatv show and talk about other parents who have killed their children. I thought the book was all right. It was kind of boring at times though because it just kept going on and on about how hes stuck in his wheelchair and how his brother and sister feed him things that his mom wont feed him when shes not looking. Overall, it was a good book. The ending is ok, it could have been better though."
4,An Eye Opener,Exploring the inner life of Shawn in Stuck in Neutral was a treat. I have worked with many people who are severly and profoundly developmentally delayed. It was a treat to read about the hidden life of this young man. I especially enjoyed his fantasies about some of the women in his life - so natural for a 14 year old. I remember one little boy in my school years ago now - he was 6 at the time. We were after a lot of work able to give him a way to indicate yes and no and discovered that he knew a lot! I kept wishing that someone could do this for Shawn. This book is not just for teens and adolescents.
4,An Interesting Look at Cerebral Palsy,"""Stuck in Neutal"" is a book I hesitated to read. It's the story of Shaun, a cerebral palsy invalid who is much brighter than everyone thinks. His father is a famous writer, and his works on Cerebral Palsy frighten Shaun. Since he was born, he's been an invalid, but a wasted genius. He can read, he can remember everything he's ever heard. During seizures, he can escape the body that's held him back for so long. It's a book worth checking out, I just don't know the exact audience to recommend this to."
2,The inconclusive ending [threw] me off.,"This was a great book, mostly. Shawn McDaniel has cerebral palsy really bad. He has a lot of seizures and no voluntary muscle control. Everyone thinks he's an idiot, a vegetable, because he can't communicate to them how smart he is. He can't even focus his eyes half the time. Shawn's voice left a strong impression and the story -- Shawn's fear that his father was going to kill him to ""put him out of his misery"" -- was original and very good.So why did you rate it a two out of five? you ask. Because the ending really made me mad. You never find out whether his dad killed him or not. It was like the author couldn't make up his mind and was like ""aw, the heck with it"". The ending left me hanging, with a bad taste in my mouth.It was very good but due to the last chapter I could not honestly recommend it to anybody."
4,Seem Dead,"The main character of this book is Shawn McDaniel. He is 14 years old and thinks his father is trying to kill him. Needless to say this book is interesting. I loved the book. I like it mostly because of the suspense the reader is put in. You never know if Shawn's dad is going to kill him or not. But many things make you think he is. So, why would Shawn's dad want to kill him? Shawn has a disease called cerebral palsy. Shawn is in a vegetated state, to put it briefly he cannot voluntarily move not a single solitary muscle, not even his eyes. Though his eyes do move from time to time he never knows where. He also frequently has seizers and his dad hates to see them and thinks Shawn is going through a lot of pain. The next best part of this book is that the book is through Shawn's point of view. so you get to hear everything Shawn would. so the question is, does Shawn want to die? Well read the book and find out. Oh by the way I recommend this book to ANYONE because I think its great."
3,pretty good,"Stuck in Neutral was my groups book. I thought it was pretty good and it one of those books for everyone, no matter what age you are you can understand it.It was about a boy shawn with Cerebral Palsy. He could Understand everyone and everything but he couldnt act the way he wanted too. Overall it was a pretty good book."
3,he she,Joeseph Rabini Stuck in in neutral was a very good book it was about a kid shawn has a feeling that his dad is out to kill him. He cant tell anyone cause he has cp he cant talk or correspond with anyone. He has a very good memory he can remember what things look like. He has good picture memory.Cruise Control is a book about a kid that that has a good basketball career. In the story he had to make a shot like full court. So he closed his eyes and just through the ball.
4,The Review,"Even though Stuck in Neutral is a book about a handicapped boy, it can apply to anyone that loves a great story. Terry Trueman (the author) creates great characters that people can connect to. With Shawn, (the handicapped) Terry can really put you in his shoes. Stuck in Neutral has great realism, If you look around in our society, you will find ""real"" people just like Shawn. Stuck in Neutral's point of view is also very interesting, because Shawn describes every thing as he experiences it. These are the many reasons why I believe that Stuck in Neutral is a great book that everyone should love."
4,Has some magic,"I suffer from bad migranes and try to control them from recurring as much as possible. Someone recommended this and I must tell you I have it sitting at my desk. Everytime I feel a headache coming on I put it on my forhead and continue with my business and I dont even realize when my headache disappeared.It's not too strong scented, so if you are like me who is very sensitive to smells then you will like this.Funny thing when my 5 year old is having a fit i roll on slightly on her wrist and she calms down. So for those with kids I would say this can serve a dual purpose ;)"
3,It's okay,"I use to use Head-On and I really loved that stuff, but now when I've looked for it it's crazy priced so I picked this one as an alternative. I don't like this one as much, I don't get the intense cooling effect with this. It does have a cooling effect just not too much. It might be okay for some but just not enough for me so I'll keep searching."
2,Did not work for me!,This product has a cooling effect and smells nice but does not relieve any type of migraine symptoms that I have.
1,i rate is ZERO,"This burned my eyes and made me feel ill from the smell. It is So tiny, what a rip off.this is the cheapest lavender i ever smelledi don't like wasting money,,,,and so don't buy it,,,,it's NO Head On.so, to make my point i'm returning it...it's just a bunch of smelly oils,,,ICK!"

1,Very poor substitute for Head On,"I can barely feel any difference between using this and not using it. I'm going to try something like icy hot but without the hot, something that actually feels cold when applied. This was a big disappointment as it produced almost no sensation of cold at all, nothing even close to what's needed for relief."

1,Horrible!!,"This author obviously had no idea what he was writing about. The book doesn't even get the scientific notation for the anti-evolution ""evidence"" right. It is a vapid and poorly constructed series of disconnected essays with no science to back up various speculations. Mr. Sippert indulges in a diatrabe against evolution and science in general. This book is a waste of time and money. I cannot for the life of me figure out why the author thinks anyone would be interested in this rediculous novel."
4,Excellant even if not perfect!,"I was told by his widow that Mr. Sippert is now dead and I read this book under a different title a number of years ago: Eternity To Eternity: Evolution is Not a Science.Even if this book does not answer ALL questions and arguments it still offers a great deal of valid answers to the evilutionist and is very worth the contemplation. However, any reader who begins prejudiced against the Bible or Christianity in general will probably not like this book. Mr. Sippert offers valid reasons for the Ice Age, the extinction of the dinosaurs, discusses the unreliability of carbon dating, how evolution violates all the major laws of REAL science and how it has affected society in a negative way. I highly recommend it for students and teenagers...and anyone else. But do not expect a mere man to have ALL the answers to explain GOD and His creation. That is what faith is for. This book is a springboard."
3,Watch with your lover,"The first time i saw this was a late nite on cable and i anticipated just another cheesy movie.Well, it came out to be different stories of releasing yourself, desires, and passions, which was more than i bargained for. I found the movie to be very erotic and sensual, and reflective of our own passions and desires. It was people expressing themselves and how they interpreted their sexual feelings as a result of ""EROS"", but i wont go into that :P. This is a movie i'd recommend to watch with your lover before a night of say, ""fun and games"", and afterwards maybe think about your own sexuality. DEFINITELY worth a watch for serious couples, ENJOY!"
3,Need for Speed Carbon,"This game is just flat out agerage. It totaly lackes the seens of speed that the other 3 Need for Speed titels for the Play Station 2 had. The new auto sculpt mode is fun but I was really hopeing that I could mod any part in the game I wanted, not just parts they said I could. The racing is also just flat out broken. With no seens of speed at all you qwickly lose track of where you are adn crash into almost everything. Plus to top it all off EA totaly screwd up the near perfict drifting. Insted of just leaving well enough alone they went ahead and redid the drifting and made it very hard to do. All in all if you want a new NFS game save up your cash buy a 360 or PS3 and then buy NFS carbon for them."
3,"NFS: Carbon, Less than expected.","When it comes to the NFS series we all have been blown away but, Carbon falls short. The muscle cars are a cool new addition but it doesn't cover all of the mistakes in the game. As in old Atari racing games, the car would sit still and the road would move and turn and, this is what NFS: Carbon feels like. Its like going back in time, and it makes it hard to see where you are going. Another mistake is EA took away drag racing. I enjoyed drag quite a bit in the past NFS games as did everyone else. The Canyon was a fresh Idea but, the while racing against the computer and you pass them it would seem as if they had a boost and they would pass you right back. A major improvement for drifting though, you had figure out the handling of the car. No two cars were the same. In my opinion, there were too few drifting events. I mastered them in no time flat. Overall unless your a die hard NFS fan, don't buy the game. It is a dissapointment in almost every aspect."
1,NFS carbon,"this game was terrible it was sent from Germany and it was not even in ps2 format, it was sent as a PC game. I would not recommend this game."
4,Great game! Canyon part is incredible.,"Yet another success for EA and Need for Speed. The cars are excellent and the races are amazing. The cop chases fall a bit short compared to Most Wanted. On the other hand, the canyon races are outstanding. I didn't give it 5 stars because the extra dvd really falls short. I expected detailed information on the cars, but it didn't fullfill my expectations. However, that didn't affect the gaming experience."
1,Problem with software,"The CD did not work, so I used the book instead. It is kind of simplistic, maybe helpful for someone who likes checklists. I wish the book came with pockets to store documents. On hindsight, I could have created a ring binder on my own with a lot better functionality than this book."
1,Defective Product,"The program would not run! I emailed Kiplinger support and they said the version I got (version 5.0) was defective and was replaced by version 5.1. Fortunately, they sent me the corrected version."
1,I totally disliked it,If you are interested in mexican popular music do not buy this CD as you'll hardly find any trace of the original melodies. If you are interested in disco-rithm you'll find it pretty dull.
4,Favorite golfer,"Bought the book for my husband, who watches golf any chance that he gets. Phil is one of his favorite players. He enjoyed the book. Glad that I bought it."
5,Very enjoyable,This is a good biography and would recommend it even if you are not an avid golfing fan. Very good value. Have passed it to other people to listen who have also enjoyed it.
5,A book to remember,"It took me ten hours to read this book, all the while I was cooking a shoulder for our fourth of July dinner. I didn't wont to finish it. One of the best books that I have ever read, makes me think even more of Phil Michelson, his parents did a remarkable job of raising him."
4,Accurate and Insightful,"Numrich's book was right on the mark concerning the adaptation of Buddhism to America, in this case Theravada Buddhism. Like a potted plant that sits on a windowsill, Theravada Buddhism will remain in its pot until planted in the ground where it will grow. Numrich's investigation into two communities reflects this very dilemma facing Theravada Buddhism. Although both communities are reaching out to their own, the fashion in which it is being done relfects an Asian element and not an American element, which will keep Theravada Buddhism in its ""pot on the windowsill."" Numrich's indepth research concerning the issue of ""adaptation"" is a well documented field study that gives the reader a greater appreciation of the growth that Theravada Buddhism must experience if it wishes to take root in America."
5,More stars!,"This album is as close to a masterpiece as humanly possible. It's the '""magnum opus"" of an uncompromising artist who has reached beyond himself with every new effort. Each song has a different rhythm, a refreshingly unique feel, complemented by the perfect solo instruments. If you know LKJ's music, you know the rhythm section is always the dreadest. The poetry is awesome, piercing and beautiful. The unmistakable trance-inducing voice of the poet just grows better with age and experience. After 40 years of listening to jazz, blues, reggae and much more, and having followed LKJ's career from ""Dread Beat An' Blood"" to ""More Time,"" I need more stars to rate this album. I dare you to listen to ""Liesense Fi Kill"" as far as the electric violin solo without pushing the repeat button. Buy this record and support Linton Kwesi Johnson's first album on his own label."
5,no more mildew to clean,"I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED ALL MY SYNTHETIC TACK FROM WINTEC. I LIVE IN A VERY HUMID CLIMATE AND ALWAYS HAD GREEN TACK UNTIL I BOUGHT ALL SYNTHETIC TACK, JUST HOSE IT OFF, GET CAUGHT IN THE RAIN OR GO IN A CREEK.---NO PROBLEM WINTEC DRIES AND IS CLEAN AS WELL AS LOOKS NICE."
5,Very informative and fun to read!,"This book covers just about everything there is to know about Reason 2.0. It has many examples, screenshots, and it is easy and fun to read. The book is great for beginners, but not boring for advanced users, I think everyone can profit from this book. It is also an excellent reference for use when working (This is great since the Reason handbook is not available in printed form).I love the book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get full usage of the reason program."
3,A different sound from Cuba,"The duet shows that Cubans can play more than Son, Timba, or Jazz. This is Buena Fe's second release, the music is subtle Pop/Rock, but the strength is in the lyrics, as they employ a wide range of poetic themes, most about love. Creating a very romanticatmosphere. The album is not bad, but it lacks originality, and better musical arrangement. I've owned it for a few years now and I hardly listen to it any more since it can become boring.If you enjoy the music of Pablo Milanes and Silvio Rodriguez you will most likely like Buena Fe, you can clearly hear their influence in the duo's songs.Hopefully their new release ""Corazonero"" will strengthen these weaknesses and prevail as solid musical release."
5,Lots of material made accessible,"I'm a Statistics PhD student so you can condition on my prior to get at what's really going on with this book.Bioinformatics is a departure from ""regular"" statistics and looks awfully messy at first pass. The sorts of assumptions one typically makes in other areas of statistical inference are patently false, so new techniques and intuitions have to be built up in order to attack these kinds of problems. This book does an excellent job of balancing the technical details with the necessary intuitions so one can really get a firm grasp on what's going on.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who hasn't done statistics at at least an advanced undergrad level (e.g., comfortable with Probability at the Ross-level and Statistical Inference at the Casella/Berger-level). But for people really interested in the material and coming from a solid statistical background the book is an excellent resource.I would also strongly recommend it to teach out of."
5,"A good read, but only if you have adequate probability and statistics background","This is a useful book for people who have some background in probability and statistics to understand methods in bioinformatics. The chapter on BLAST theory is useful, as not too many books talk about it. Newcomers into the field who have absolutely no math background may find it hard to understand, though - definitely not a book for the beginner."
4,4-STAR PLAYHOUSE!!!!!,"These are two episodes from the TV series ""Four Star Playhouse"". I find the stories very enjoyable. The prints are good, but with the typical issues relagated to syndicated shows(incomplete show intros, removal of sponsors, etc.)."
3,It's good for professional singers and instructors,This book seems to be more for voice teachers than students. I am not a professional and so it is more technical than I was hoping for
3,Buy it used,"I truly believe the book is too expensive for its quality and lenght, and you can find it used at very cheap prices and in extremelly good conditions, the one I bought was really as good as new and I only paid USD12.I think the description of the book is a little misleading since I was expecting something like MArvin Harris, Diamond or Robert Wright analyzes on the existence of spirituality and it turned out to be a compilation of essays. True, most of them are really interesting and if you are not subscribed to LStore via university it is quite difficult to find these papers by themselves. The selected authors are like the divas of anthropology and I think that the book is nice to have as a consultation tool whenever you feel like wandering into certain topics."
5,"This is not only educational, but inspirational as well.","This movie starts with the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement and ends in the mid-1980's. It is really detailed and in depth. It starts the Civil Rights Movement at B.M. (Before Martain Luther King Jr.) and continues through his life and work, into the mid-1980's. I think that if you are an educator, parent, or just like history you will love this video. If you are an African-American parent, teacher, etc. and want to give your children, students, etc. a sense of history (their history) then this would be a great gift. In today's society when we take things like voting or simply the place where we sit on the bus for granted, we can look back and really appreciate what the leaders of the Civil Rights Movements have done for us. I think that this video shows that the struggles that African-American's went through to gain the simpliest freedoms show that one month just isn't enough. That Black History should be taught all year around. END"
5,Eyes on the Prize Box Set,"This is an excellent source of information on the origins of the Civil Rights Movement and how it progressed from Martin Luther King Jr. to Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. A must for anyone interested in the Civil Rights Movement, Black History or history in general."
5,An Exquisite Novel,"The Old Capital, though mentioned along with Snow Country and A Thousand Cranes in the announcement of Kawabata's Nobel Prize in literature, is not as well-known as either of the other two. Yet it is my favorite of his novels.Kawabata explores the distances between people, the differences between them, the value of tradition, and the difficulties of knowing in his narration of Chieko's discovery of her twin sister, from whom she was separated shortly after birth by a kidnapping - or was it by an abandonment?I neither speak nor read Japanese, but J. Martin Holman's translation must be a good one. Virtually every page held me entranced with its beauty."
4,A journey to Kyoto,"Anyone who has made the journey to the old capital Kyoto or spent anytime in the land of the rising sun will truly appreciate the poetic nature of Yasunari Kawabata's work. Yasunari's avid descriptions are enough to make you feel as though you are there again or visiting for the first time if you have not already. Distinctively Japanese in the themes of nature, tradition and gender roles, this book is sure to touch the soul of any reader. Recommened for the disconcerning reader in search of a little subtle complexity rapped in hidden charm, Japanese style."
5,THE FUNNIES THING IN THE WORLD!,"I read the book, My Life an a Blundering Balernina. If you didn't, then please do. It's so funny!"
1,disappionted,"OMG THIS ITEM WAS SO SMALL IT IS A JOKE FOR THE PRICE, ENTRYWAY BENCHES? I DONT THINK SO UNLESS IT IS THE TINEST ENTRY WAY EVER MADE. I WAS SO UPSET BUT ,THE TROUBLE OF SENDING THEM BACK IS NOT EVEN WORTH THE TIME ."
3,Have to agree with Ho-Hum on this one,"I have never been to the region, but after doing a great deal of family research over the last couple of years I have discovered I have a lot of roots there. I had hoped this book would give me a feel for the beautiful towns, instead I got the postcard photos or pics of the inside of a church or the door to a building. Really? THAT is supposed to give me a feel for the MOST beautiful towns in New England? I'd hoped for more Main Street or City Square type photos and not so much of the generic, could have been taken most anywhere in Tennessee, where I live, photos that gave little to NO feeling of New England."
4,New England Beauty,"Wonderful photagraphs and great images of beautiful New England! Reminiscent of my childhood, and old fashioned villages of yesterday. A must for the coffee table!"
2,Smaller than indicated,Just wanted to let you all know to beware about the size of this aquarium before you buy it. I am happy with it overall and it is very cool. My problem is the packaging states that it is 2.4 gallons of capacity. This would be true based on the size dimensions but you lose space with the filter/pump and about an inch inside the aquarium based on design. I had two gallons ready to fill the aquarium and was shocked when I got just over one and a half gallons into it and it was full. So beware that this aquarium capacity is only 1.6 gallons and not 2.4 which makes placing anything in it other than a betta or drawf shrimp almost impossible. They state you can place three fish in it with the filter established but even with a betta in it that is pushing it based on actual water capacity!
3,Its just ok,some of the jackets have broken holders for the discs. I opened up the box and plastic pieces fell out.
5,Got this for my wife,"The moment it came in the mail, my wife tore it open, and hasn't had a day or night without watching it, good series. The only complaint I have is the confusing tracking, shipped by DHL, DHL turns around and hands it off to USPS, and eventually it got to us in the mail. When tracking from Amazon, you have to look up DHL Global Mail tracking, and from there, you click the tracking number which directs you to the USPS site to track. Not a show stopper, but a pain in the rear end. Other than that, seller shipped it pretty quick, and it came to us in great condition."
5,Ghost Whisperer scores a big hit,I'm sorry that I haven't written a review before now. I got this as a Chrtistmas present for a friend and she was overjoyed with it.
3,ghost whisperer pack,"Happy to have recieved the ghost whisperer complete series pack. Was dissapointed that they where not compatable to our new dvd players. Have to use older player because the region code is not compatable, never had this problem with other dvds i have bought from amazon.Thought that was taken care of when country was put in. Anyway still able to watch them on one dvd player. michael"
5,Easy way to make someone happy,"I surprised my wife with the Ghost Whisper collection for her birthday. I was going to purchase one season at a time as they are pretty pricey, but on Amazon I found the whole 5 year collection for what two seasons would cost in any other store. My wife loves the series, it is an entertaining program and something to keep you busy on stormy days or weekends."
4,Ghost Whisperer,Very fast shipment of my item. The only issue I have is some of the disks are scratched and a few of the episodes skip so I am unable to watch them.
2,"for a vegan cookbook, this has a strange vibe","I'd been looking forward to getting this cookbook for months, and finally bought a copy through Amazon. I received it yesterday, and in the evening I settled down to peruse it. The recipes look quite interesting, and I was eager to try them.But, I was very surprised to see the author references Sally Fallon on the topic of canola oil. Sally Fallon? The zealous anti-vegetarian crusader? The internet guru who claims you'll sicken and die, if not for consuming vast quantities of meat? Why is her name referenced as an expert in a vegetarian cookbook? If Fallon and her research are to be believed about canola oil, isn't Leslie McEachern in a way validating Fallon's entire ideology, which includes devout anti-vegetarianism?McEachern might have found another authority to back up her ideas about canola, which is a controversial subject in itself."
3,Useful but mixed,"This is certainly a useful combination of text and audio but I don't think the authors got it quite right. The text is a little on the light side wrt grammar and the audio examples of ""useful phrases"" are very definitely odd.I work as a surgeon and I can't remember the last time I used the phrase ""the doctors are talking about a liver transplant and possibly a bypass""! I guess the idea is to use examples of grammar rather than anything one might use in practice, but the utility of the work could have been improved with a little more care.The grammar component was a useful summary but I would still recommend ""En Bonne Forme"" for early advanced studies."
4,Lively and Up-to-date,"The course is very well structured. I like especially the dialogues for their liveliness and the business information provided in the 'Le coin des affairs' section. There is also a good coverage of grammar, but not always enough explanation is provided so that from time to time I need to consult another source. That's why I rated the course four stars. However, this is the best advanced French course I've seen."
3,Poor Sound Quality and Snobbery Ruins Otherwise Good Product,"I have the Italian version of this product and it is much better so this is a disappointment. Sound quality is awful - need very loud volume and everyone still sounds like they are talking in a cave. Can't imagine I will ever need to say ""red and yellow reversible damask cotton"" in English, let alone in French. Situations not realistic, voice-over actors bad. Still -- the lessons are good reviews with lots of new and useful vocabulary. Definitely for the patient or very advanced student of French, but I agree -- LL's French 2 is a better product."
2,'Advanced'?,"I finished the Beginner-Intermediate Ultimate French and picked up a copy of Advanced. The only things advanced about this book were the dialogues--I was surprised and disappointed to find that a lot of the grammar in this book had already been covered in the beginner-intermediate version. Don't bother with this book. Chances are, if you're at an advanced level, it doesn't have much to teach you."
3,Not very fun.,"As are most living language materials, this course is boring.I love French, I love learning it, but this course is about as exciting as reading a technical manual.A lot of courses out there are fun to learn, make you laugh, and you find yourself WANTING to understand so you can enjoy the humor or out-of-context situations. (Like the book French Now!)Plenty of useful info in this course, even more useful if you need something to put you to sleep."
2,Ugh,By far the worst book I have ever been forced to read for college.It is agonizing just getting through each section.
2,Could be better...,"This book could do with some revising. The important terms are not bold, but italic. Headings only loosely describe what you are learning. There are no ""key terms"" type boxes, or review questions at the end except for some touchy-feely discussion questions.If your professor is using the test bank for the book, be forewarned that you will have to dig for the key concepts in each chapter.Earth to Katherine Miller, no one in their right mind is going to read your book cover-to-cover because they want to. Any study skills class will enlighten you to how students actually cover textbook material."
2,"Theory, theory, theory","This book lists theory after theory after theory, with hardly any examples in the text to explain, or at least break up the monotony. If you can avoid getting this book, you will be a happier and more knowledgeable person (since you can probably find something else that explains things better)."
5,Pretty awsome product,"Initially, I was hesitant in buying this product as i did not know how it would fit with my bed caps. Once I installed them, they fit perfectly. They really enahnced the appearance of the truck and aside from this product already being very functional (anchoring items in your truck bed) it also serves to hold down my bed caps. My bed caps are only held down with 3m tape. Now that I have put these pop up hooks, it really holds down the bed caps very well without hindering their performance. Overall, extremely satisfied with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has a Chevrolet Silverado. Another plus, it really enhances the appearance of the truck!"
4,Pop-up Tie Down Clamps,"These work really well. They can be difficult to put in. According to the company you should make sure to use a manual screw driver instead of a power tool. We had two that went in smoothly and two that stripped out. The two replacements went in easily also. Once in, they are wonderful."
1,AWFUL,They are the WORST tie downs ever. I got 4 and each one the screw went halfway or more down the threads and then cross threaded because the threads are cheap and strip out. I was so mad and getting them out so they weren't stuck on the truck was just absurd. They would have been nice had they not cheaped out on making them so thin. To sum it up... They are cheaply made and are not worth any money.
4,Good laptop backpack,"Of the laptop backpacks that I've considered, this one maximizes quality and appearance. Very comfortable to carry, good laptop protection, plenty of room for other items. The only downside is some issues with the finish quality that are not expected of a company like Samsonite. These issues include some stitches that got semi-loose, small tears in the inside fabric, etc. However, these are small issues overall."
2,Seems nice but is much smaller than what it looks,"It has space for the computer, like 1 notebook, and some cables but thats it.Its no near roomy. I sent it back as soon as it came."
2,Who let the Hound dog out?,"I love Mark Chesnutt... the tone of his voice is great - but this album is all baleful old boo-hoo songs. Not worth buying if you like fun songs such as ""Bubba shot the jukebox"" or ""Going through the big D.""Blech."
2,"I love Mark Chesnutt, but...","No one sings a honky tonk song better than Mark Chesnutt, but this CD doesn't make the cut. It would have been hard for him to top ""Savin' the Honky Tonks,"" and this album doesn't come close. First of all, why are there only ten songs? And of the ten, why are a few previously released material? There's no excuse for a CD like this--only 10 songs and some of them old material. Thank God Mark Chesnutt is singing good old-fashioned honky tonk again, because he's the best in the business, but I still find this CD disappointing. I also can't agree with reviewer T.Yap ""thy5468""'s pomposity. Who is he or she trying to impress?"
2,"Great Player, poor teacher","Yes information was provided but I feel it should have been more than a ""watch me play"" format. I feel it was a total waste of my hard earned money."
2,Not so Good,This wasn't really worth the money.The sets were basic and the makeup on Potipher's wife was laughable---Joseph wouldn't have wanted her. The video of Joseph starring Ben Kingsley was far better and you could skip Jacob altogether.
3,A Filler For your Library,"I've seen better film depictions of Jacob and Joseph, but if you want to buy this for a companion with your other religious films, go ahead, you may watch it from time to long time."
4,"The Story of Jacob and Joseph, TVM","This is a very good, albeit rather basic account of the Biblical stories of Jacob and Joseph. It gives a fine account of the two Patriachs, in one part each, with very little poetic licence or interpretation. It was shot on location in the Middle East, and many of the actors speak with a very distinct accent on their English, which adds enormously to the film's sense of 'long ago and far away'. This is especially true of Laban and Pharoh. The only critisism is that the second part-Joseph- probably deserved a little longer running time and budget, with the sets and costumes not quite up to the true spectacle of ancient Egypt. But overall this production is a very worthy portrayal of the events."
2,Okay ... I guess,"I'm a youth pastor, and was looking for a film to end our series on Joseph, so I only watched the Joseph part of this one.Biblically, it's okay. It tells the story pretty faithfully to scripture.My only problem is that it makes up this idea that Joseph could read and write, where his other brothers couldn't. It then uses that as part of the reason his brothers hated him, practically the only reason he was exalted in Potiphar's house, and a big part of the reason he was exalted by Pharaoh. It down-plays the idea that God exalted Joseph, and makes it seem like Joseph's intellect is what helped him out.The production is kind of cheap, the acting is a little weak, and Joseph is this '70's stud muffin type. Still hoping to find something better to show a group of teenagers. I don't think this will keep their attention. (And if it does, it will just be to laugh at the ""Egyptian's"" shorty-short skirts!)"
4,Movie night was great,"My Sunday School class were captivated by this movie. They asked questions and we discussed the content and compared it to the Bible. There were some sections that didn't agree. . .and we found those, but not too many. Enjoyable."
5,Great Fun Educational Game,"My husband and I actually bought this game for ourselves. I must admit we are a young couple and played this in elementary. Its way better now! We love playing it. It's a lot of fum. We HAVE Windows XP on our computer and it works great, no problems at all. Don't know why it doesn't work on the others computers. Hours of fun entertainment! Kid friendly, non-violent (well you do get to go hunting, its a lot of fun;) Highly reccommended."
3,"Nice Product, Short Life","I purchases this as a Christmas gift over a year ago for a major Browns Fan. The cover is soft and seems durable, but after only a couple months on the stearing wheel, with normal usage, the seams started coming apart. The person still uses the cover, but it is tattered and frayed. Nice thought, nice gift, but don't expect to get a lot of use and maintain the appearance for very long."
2,A LITTLE ON THE BLAH SIDE,"I used to live in Philadelphia and was a big fan of Bookbinder's, especially for their lobster bisque. I was hoping that the canned version would bring back fond memories. I recall the taste as being very rich and 'lobstery"", with bits of real lobster. The canned version is more like what Campbell's soup might have done if they did bisque. It's OK, not bad, but no kick or seafood flavor. I added sherry, but it justs tastes blah with sherry."
2,Parakeets Egg Biscuit,More information would be forthcoming if my two parakeets were eating the product.They do not want to eat it. Fresh products are good and this one is packaged like it maybe nutritious option but there is no date on the package.
5,A not so obvious book,"I read this book more than once and noticed that the second time I read it, it was much different. After doing the exercizes for a while, not only my impressions of what I was reading changed, but my whole life changed. I am deeply indebted for the awareness this book has brought to me and I recommend it to everyone."
3,Another good Mini book,"If you are buying a Mini Cooper, read this book first, read it again, check out the Mini you want to buy and read the book one more time. I bought my Mini first but would have made a different choice if I studied a bit more.This is also a good book for reference for restoration or just facts about the car.I would say this book, along with a few others, is important in ones collection of Mini books."
4,ESSENTIAL MINI COOPER:The Cars and Their Story 1961-71,"For those younger or others who may be interested in the history of the Mini Coopers, this is an excellent book for your overall history. In the 1960s I raced a Morris Cooper 970S with success.For any Mini Cooper enthusiast, this is a book you must have."
3,Just the essentials,"This is typical of many auto marque books. It's a step by step, fact by fact, history of the Mini, with what feature changed when sorts of details.What it's not is that it's not a guide on what to look for if you're going to buy one and it's not filled with enough photos to use as an authenticity guide or concours preparation guide."
1,Only Half The Examples have REAL Tab,"Only half the examples have REAL tab. The rest have a number-intensive second-rate substitute for tab. This so-called educational video has other shortcomings as well. Albert Lee is not a very good music teacher. His ""slow"" playing is way too fast. Combine that with the lack of REAL tab and you've got a DVD worth passing up. You can find Albert's licks on the web for free, in accurate REAL tab."
3,Great Documentry but no licks,"I found this dvd fun to watch and informative if you are a fan of Trevors.But i thought this was an actual lesson based instructional dvd which it is not.Its an interview and thats about it, even the equipment talked about is out of date by todays standards.This dvd is a one time watcher not a revisited teaching dvd."
4,Book of the New Sun,"Great book--I found echoes of Chaucer, Bocaccio, and many others in its pages. I wanted more answers, the whole history of Urth, but if it had all been laid out I think it would have taken away from the books' mystery. There were definitely a lot of flaws (mostly characters who seemed to come from nowhere for no reason), but that acutally made it seem more like a lot of medieval literature. A ton of fun to read."
3,Well-crafted but ultimately unsatisfying,"I finished the first four books and though I appreciated the fullness of the universe that Gene Wolfe created, I found these books to be unsatisfying. I think the problem is that there is very little action and the story only comes together in the fourth book - The Urth of the New Sun- 800 pages later! Also, I never identified with the character of Severian who is emotionally empty. I never saw any special characteristics in him that would elevate him above the common man to a position like the Autarch or the Savior of the universe. He's no Paul Atreides! But the book does have a very richly developed world and I was fascinated with Wolfe's portrayl of an Earth far into the future where magic and science are regarded as the same thing. And the hierodules and the green man were really interesting characters. Overall, this book is one to get from the library, not to buy; the lack of a strong main character and forward plot movement severely cripples it."
2,Pretentious writing and disturbing plot,"I don't think I've ever been so torn by a book.In one sense, it is grander than much sf/fantasy,and deserves a mention. On the other, I findthe book disturbing and the writingpretentious (use of obscure words which addnothing to the story).I'm giving it two stars for the original ideas,but no more due to the writing and unsympatheticcharacters."
2,Unworthy of so much Praise,"This is the first of Gene Wolfe's books that I have read and probably the last. I was hoping to find a new exciting story after reading many other science fiction and fantasy books, but rather I found this ""masterpiece.""The story starts out well enough, but rapidly goes downhill from there. There is so much imagery in the first book that there is little room for anything else, such as enjoyment. I found the writing in this book a little to heavy for me as well. I don't particularly like having to re-read every sentence again and again until I finally grasp the meaning. But maybe that's just me. While I was reading this book I felt like I was back in high school reading one of the boring literature pieces given by my professor. This book would have been much better if it were about 50 pages long.This isn't something I'll pick up again."
2,Dull,"You won't get an engrossing story. You won't get much action, either. There are some interesting points here and there, but overall I'd say it was a good cure for insomnia. The first half of this book, the first book of the new sun, is okay, and although the second half has some good moments, overall it is very dull. It reminded me of the second part of Don Quixote, which is to say I was extremely bored while reading it.Here is to hoping the second volume in this collection is better."
1,Beautifully written but extremely boring,"Well, Shadow & Claw is like a beautiful stage with beautifully dressed characters with blank faces.No personality and no interesting story. Maybe this book is just an introduction to the next one,but that IS NOT an excuse to make it so boring that I actually felt that I lost my time reading it.For those who are looking for an interesting story or good action, stay away from this."
2,Just not enjoyable,"Having finished the first 2 installments in this series I can safely say I won't be finishing it. It is difficult to read because of the lack of plot and the use of ""big"" words you haven't seen since the SAT. While you can infer the meaning of most of the words based on the context of the sentence it is still very annoying.The first 2 books are essentially descriptive imagery of the places and people Severian happens to meet on his completely random and meaningless journey. There is no adventure or character development - just an endless stream of bizarre imagery interlaced with hidden references to present day Earth and ancient myths. Maybe the point of this story is revealed in books 3 and 4, but I don't care to find out."
2,Be Warned!,"While certainly a very eye-opening andcreative novel, this book is tedious, confusing, and ultimately very frustrating. I must have read the opening few pages five or six times, before I finally understood what Gene was trying to say. If you are ready to struggle painstakingly through a book, than maybe this is the series for you. Otherwise, skip it. I made the mistake of reading the entire first book, and about half of the second before finally giving up."
1,What a disappointment!,"What a boring book. (Or rather, what a boring bunch of 4 books). The main character is Severian the torturer who pursues his destiny across the lands of Urth. Torture, cannibalism, grave robbing, public executions ad nauseum abound. I hope I'm not spoiling anything when I say that Severian does eventually decide to quit his job (well, duh). Wolfe uses some excellent descriptive prose to fashion an Urth of the far future. The place is alright but the motivations of the main characters are obscure and consequently uninteresting. I would suggest Zola and his pit ponies for a much better read."
3,An acquired taste I suppose,"Just a word of caution; Gene Wolfe has been called ""The Thomas Pynchon"" of science fiction and, like Pynchon, he isn't for everyone. I just finished the first two installments of this tetralogy and I don't think I'll finish it. The writing is, no doubt, brilliant and inspired, however, the plot never emerges and characters come and go with little regard for purpose. If you love fine langauge, then this is for you. If you like a compelling story, solid plots, and absorbing narrative, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
5,"mysterious, compelling and heartfelt","I have little but praise for Gene Wolfe's bittersweet epic of a man who is one of science fiction's most fascinating and contradictory characters. By upbringing he is a man made to cause pain, by nature he is a man who tries to save people from it. But I warn readers, Gene Wolfe has created an Earth (Urth) so far in the future it is wholly alien - and he doesn't explain the details that make it alien! This adds to the mystery, but it can be very confusing. However, I gave these books five stars, because he is so subtly deliberate. His sensitivity to language (especially using unusual, evocative descriptions) and his learning (creating allusions tantalizingly familiar) put other authors to shame, except Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. ""The Book of the New Sun"" reminds me strongly of Jack Vance's ""Tales of the Dying Earth"", except that Wolfe writes with more economy, less penchant for the wittily absurd and with a keen sense of all the beauty and folly that is humanity."
4,"Shadowy first half, can't wait for the second","I have read for years about how great The Book Of The New Sun is and it was worth the wait. While it is a story told by the title character with all that can mean in terms of truth this is not Tales Of A Dying Earth. (((Cugel in Tales does not have the level or quality of reveals, foreshadowing as well the payoff that Shadow & Claw has.)))Our anti hero springs from a despicable but honorable profession and apparently rises to the top. In his world the humans made it off earth and some have returned apparently and that alone adds better story telling potential that Tales.I will be off to the book store this afternoon to get the second half of this damned fine series."
3,"This book is not a ""masterpiece""...","After reading the reviews for this book, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it didn't come close to meeting my expectations. True, it's a great concept for a book, and I enjoyed getting tiny glimpses into the history and background of this world. However, nothing can salvage the fact that the plot is pretty thin and the writing style is cumbersome for no other apparent reason than for the author to appear clever. I'm still glad I read the book, but don't think for a second that this book is in the same league as Dune, or Lord of the Rings. That kind of talk is absurd."
2,Tailored to nerds,"I found this book at a cheap hotel in Southeast Asia. This novel boils down to a guy with a magic sword wandering around and discovering the wonders of the library and having sex with just about every single female character. As an escapist fantasy for repressed nerds who read too much and have sex too little, it's a masterpiece, and even a page turner. However there was nothing to elevate it above any of the other ""airplane novels"" one might expect to find at a cheap hotel in Southeast Asia."
1,Storyline is not something you may drop for free,"After I finished reading the first volume (and immidiately cancelled the second from my order) my disappointment slowly turns into disgust.What do I care for someone dreamy imagination? The book must have a story to tell, not just being a pile of so-called ""gems"" of style.All the story I found is torturer in black cloak and mask staying between various decorations. Sometimes he loses his sword. Sometimes he uses it. That's all.Only thing I don't understand is why the book is rated so high."
2,Adolescent writing.,"Gene Wolfe tries really hard, to write that is. He has a large vocabulary, but not much else. I've never read a writer's prose that insisted so much upon itself, but came off as the writing of an ""aspiring"" writer. By that I mean someone who has all the window dressing but no literary or artistic form. For example, his description is near non-existent. Plot developments happen hurriedly, one after the other, without any explanation or cohesion. It was common in the Shadow part, I only read that half, I couldn't take any more, for a climactic fight to take, at most, a paragraph. Important plot changes happen in sentences; it's like a bunch of random fantasy ideas thrown into a novel without any integration. The book is kisch. Buying this book would be like going to a store and puchasing an original Nintendo instead of a Wii. Don't waste your money or your time, please! Other good fantasy exists."
1,I regret the time I wasted on these four books,"I won't go on and on (as the author did) but instead refer you to the other one-star reviews. At first I was interested in Wolfe's funereal tone and odd subject matter, but after 800 pages, I'm sorry to inform you, you won't find out whether the world got saved or not. The hope of at least a bit of plot resolution was the only thing that kept me going to the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.If you like Wolfe's books or writing for themselves, that's fine, I'm not criticizing you, but the first time reader has a right to know that many people (including many people who enjoy other difficult and demanding works) don't feel the way you do.Instead, or in addition, please read John Crowley's ""Little, Big,"" or Steven Erikson's Malazan books, starting with ""Gardens of the Moon."" Those are also long, confusing, and demanding, but they will reward you more."
3,Started Strong But Couldn't Hold Until the End,"The book started strong. But as with many science fiction writers the the author tried to weave too many ideas and stories together which by the end of the book left me confused, unattached to the characters and just not interested anymore. While this book as a huge following I remember being very disappointed with it by about the final quarter. It has been a year since I read it and I am finally getting around to picking up the sequel. All in all it is alright, but there are better books out there, this is a wait for the Library to get it to you and not a drop cash/money on it read."
2,Not worth the investment of time,I forced myself to finish these first three chapters in hopes that it would improve. It didn't. I couldn't stand any of the characters by the end.
5,Gene Wolfe's Shadow and Claw,"Not for the feint of heart, Gene Wolfe's Shadow and Claw,is the first of the two books of the New Sun. His rich discription, unusual characters and plot full of mystery make the tale of a torturer all the more intriguing. His writing is satisfyingly dark and does not avoid the harsh truths of his character's failures. No one writes like Gene Wolfe."
5,Hghly enjoyed it,"Contrary to what many reviewers are saying, I, a fan of the book, do not feel that I am raised upon any pedestal. Rather, I found the novel addicting and well written. I enjoyed all of the details, even when they didn't push the plot forward. The novel exuded a great sense of mystery, at times similar to the sensations produced in dreams. If you don't agree, thats fine, but to generalize admirers of the work as elitists is pretty asinine."
5,A fantasy/sci fi novel of the first rank!,"Serious, subtle, atmospherically lush, psychologically austere, ingenious: this is my favorite novel in this genre. Four volumes (originally), it is long but not too long, such is the glamour of the distant-future world of seeming magic that Wolfe creates. Our protagonist, a tradesman, to wit, a torturer, encounters dozens of bizarre characters and circumstances. But there a couple of things whose full import is not know until the end that provide a subtle, unifying explanation: the `Claw', and a substance that allows our simple torturer, against any desire of his, to become Autarch, ruler of the planet."
1,Yawn...What have I been reading for the last 20 pages?,"Cured me of insomnia. It was torture getting through all four volumes of this incomprehensible story of a very far future dying Earth with aliens and cyborgs traveling back and forth through time and all kinds of goofy allusions to mythologies of every ilk and ancient abandoned spaceports used as fortress cities and...Well, you get the picture --- not very original stuff, and to make matters worse, a very pretentious writing style --- so get out your dictionary, you're going to need it several times on just about every page (Hey, I have a Ph.D., so I ain't dumb...). And, to paraphrase: Yes, it's a hard (and exceedlingly long) read --- and ,in the end, not worth the effort. It's ""Sci Fi"" for ""literary"" people who really don't like sci fi, but, if they did, this is the kind of stuff they'd like it to be...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...Save your time and money and read Jack Vance instead. Now, there's a for real Dying Earth!"
2,Rubbish,After 50 pages it sits collecting dust. If you're looking for reading enjoyment this is not the book.
1,Backup TP,"I think a good book is one that stimulates the imagination so much that, upon thinking about the story later, the reader remembers what he saw in his mind rather than black words on white paper. My experience with this book is just black words on white paper.The fictional world created by the author was not described in such a way as to make me feel as if I were in it, or even to make me want to be a part of it.The development of the characters was also not up to par with other novels that I typically enjoy. None of them caused me anything other than a shrug.Also, this is not a poolside or airplane read. I consider myself a bit of a word-nerd, and even I was reaching for the dictionary a little too often to figure out what the author was trying to say.This one didn't deserve a place of honor in my bookshelf. I put it on top of the toilet next to theCharmin Ultra Soft 36 Big Roll/200 Sheets. I figure I can use it if I run out of the latter."
1,Literary masterpiece?,"I bought both of the books of the New Sun at once. What a shame. After laboriously reading the first volume, I'm not going to waste my time reading the second one. I think one way that academics and so-called literary types make themselves feel superior is to take confusing, meandering pointless books like this, proclaim them masterpieces and then put themselves on a pedestal and say if you didn't get it, you just don't have the capacity to understand a great literary work.I see no point to this story. The adventures that Severian has meander all over the place, having no flow, no theme, no plot, and I had to really force myself to finish this book. I read over a hundred books a week, and I have read some ""literary classics"" that I enjoyed. Some of them were difficult to read, but the story made sense, the character motives could be understood, and eventually I would get drawn in to the story. Not so with this."
4,...I do not blame you. It is no easy road,"So ends the second book of the new sun, haven't read it? Then read it to find out what I am talking about and have a thrill exploring the far-flung future that Severian inhabits all under the ever watchful eye of the Autarch."
2,"Do you like ""dense, allusion-rich"" prose?","I can't recall where I read that description of Wolfe's prose, but it's apt. The writing in this book is dense and full of allusions. Dense like cornbread that's too dry, and murky allusions to things you don't know. If you like your writing foggy and unnecessarily complex, this may be the book for you. Also if you like torture scenes, which I am no fan of.I hate to be so negative, but that was the case for me with this book. I tried Wolfe because F&SF; magazine so highly recommended him, because a number of authors I like (including Gaiman) recommend him, and because I liked his story in F&SF; magazine's tribute issue. First I started the Wizard Knight series, and I liked the first book of that fairly well. Then I tried this torturer series, but I found it unpleasant and virtually unreadable. It's just not my cup of tea."
3,I dont get it,"This book seems to jump around a lot to me. Perhaps I am not well read enough to catch all the literary allusions, but I was just overwhelmed. The language is incredibly intricate, I had to read many passages several times over to figure out what was going on. Beware."
4,A good book on Regime-switching models,"The regime-switching model is getting popular since Hamilton introduced it in his 1988 paper. Dr. Krolzig has done a good job studying the extensions of the model, especially those leading to the vector autoregressive models. The book is theoretically complete in the sense that the author discusses the time series properties of the model. The other good thing is that the application examples reviewed in the book make the presentation more illustrative too. Overall, this is a good book in this topic. The only problem, if any, is that the author tries to provide too much in one volume of the book."
1,Amateur hour...,"Oh my... I love cheezy sci fi flicks, and even most Troma films, but this does not even rate as cheezy. Just bad, bad, bad... extremely amateurish acting, bad filming/lighting/sound, even the ""gore"" was laughable... Maybe good for a film school/acting course on what not to do. Seems totally filmed with a bargain shop video camera. Painful to watch and a Waste of money."
2,Leave your brain at the door.,"2.5 starsDid you ever see bad films, well here is your chance.The Troma company that does these films is reputated for thesetypes of films like the toxic avenger series they produced.I gave the movies 2.5 stars cause i saw a glimpse of some so -so not too bad acting here and there..and for the money they spend on fake blood for their special effects....hey at least they tried. These movies are watchable and i sure have a fan base. So if you enjoy Troma films you will enyoy these science fiction flicks."
1,Worst 2 movies I have ever seen.,"As far as I can remember, these movies are the worst movies I have ever seen. A complete utter waste of money to purchase or rent. Really bad."
5,Flesh Eaters to the Extreme !!!1!1!,"What can I say about ""flesh eater"" that history hasn't already said for me? It lives up to its name with a high body count and decent amount of gore. The dark and disturbing sci-fi film is set in the beautiful landscape of New Jersey, the last place anyone would expect for this gruesome tail to unfold. It's good to know that when aliens attack that is where they will start. This intricate plot is well developed and ends in quite an unexpected twist. I recommend this movie for anyone with a vivid imagination and good sense of humor. Fun for the whole family!"
3,Nice watch but the battery was bad,"The watch and the presentation of this one was really nice... The battery come damage,I have to go to a Movado store to replace it. $40 dollars for this and they told me that the seller should give me the watch working. Then the deal finally was not so good."
3,The Vision,"This is a Lee Remick film that is a bit of a strange film that was boring at times. If you are a fan of Lee Remick go for it. If not, you may want to pass this film by."
4,Bodylove,"Not completeyly the book I expected, but it had some really interesting information. I though eating disorders were only for those who were overly thin, I have learned different. It's helping me look at my body in a whole different light. For those of us who have a hard time accepting our bodies it's definately a good read."
3,difficult to read but great information,This was definitely a scholarly read. I enjoyed the challenge but feel that some of the info was lost in the overly worded chapters.
5,Hubby likes it!,"I got this for hubby for Christmas. He said it's exactly the kind he wanted, it has all the sizes you could possibly need. He likes that it's a good brand that he trusts."
4,Nice socket set to have at home,This is a good to have socket set for home use. It's nice that it comes with the case. I'm not sure if this is good enough for professional use tho. It is definitely good enough for regular home use.
1,The long read of Chet Baker,This book annoys me. It is so badly written and put together and fails miserably to hold the reader's attention. Why did James Gavin attempt to write such a biography if he had nothing new to tell his readers about Chet Baker? Mr Gavin ... don't waste our time with this regurgitated dribble.Chet Baker's life was self indulgent to the hilt. James Gavin makes Baker out to be some sort of hero. Baker was no hero; he was a pitiful lost soul who just happened to be a good musician and vocalist ... whenever he could get his act together.As for making a movie of Baker's life ... that sounds like a sure way to file for bankruptcy.This book deserves to be left on the warehouse shelf. It is not a good read.
4,Dorian Gray in reverse,"For those with an unhealthy curiosity about Chet Baker this is the book for you. And I don't mean that in a bad way. Chet is a guilty pleasure, there are many many far more talented jazz men whose work does not get a shred of the attention that Chet does. But Chet does have the romantic arc, the sort of James Dean face and some genuinely affecting music...especially those wispy love songs. The dirt is dished here but necessarily so, the author is clearly an intelligent character and seems to strike a reasonable balance about Chet. While stirpping Chet of romance he stills seems a bit taken by the myth, by some of his music and some of those classic early photos. One of the more interesting side lights is a peek into Bruce Weber's universe, whose comment that Baker's beauty was fascinating by being ""a bit destroyed"" illuminates in some blunt way the vaguely vampirish urges that push the Baker cult."
1,Deep in a Dream is a nightmare!,"I find this book to be a completely unbalanced look at a man who created a remarkable body of work. It's hard to know how Baker could have possibly found the time to record and perform during all the heroin, rape, arson, removal of dead bodies, marriages, divorces, swindaling, cheating and stealing that Gavin claims happened. And while it is obvious that Baker was a flawed human being, he was also a superb talent -- James Gavin seems to want to take that away from Baker as well. He uncourageously digs up and quotes every unfavorable review he can find from the 50's press that suggests Baker was a hype.Mr. Gavin's book is proof that those who can ""do"" and those who cannot write fiction about those who can and pass it off on the public as ""biography."""
5,"A Long Night, Indeed","James Gavin does execellent work in detailing Chet Baker's rise to fame and fortune and ultimate fall. The story itself is amazing -- Baker, born with good looks and a natural musical ability, squanders it all away because of drugs.Interesting to read about Baker's various relationships, both in an out of the industry, including his working relationship with Gerry Mulligan and Stan Getz. Gavin also does a good job detailing how Baker insecurities made him lean more and more on drugs, and how drugs ultimately ruined his career and life.As the story unfolds we see how Baker became more and more reliant on drugs, doing anything to get a fix. A very scary story, and one that is told well by Gavin.Baker's musical legacy has been debated by the experts for many years. Charlie Parker, after hearing him on the West Coast, raved about his talents. Certainly Baker deserves a place in the history of jazz, and, if you're a fan of jazz, Gavin's biography of him is well worth your time."
4,No sympathy,"This account of Chet Baker's life and music is well written and interesting, especially in it description of Baker's musical delivery and style in relation to his peers at the time. However, I found this to be a tough read because Baker was such a detestable slime ball of a human being. He is almost totally unsympathetic from start to finish, particularly in his treatment of his wife and children, not to mention every person who attempted to befriend him. Yes, he was a great trumpet player, but he was also a childish, abusive, manipulative monster with an unquenchable thirst for hard drugs. Gettin through 400 pages about such a person was hard for me, but Gavin does an effective job in making it just tolerable enough."
3,Ridin' the Horse,"Gavin's biography is still the standard one to read if you want a general introduction to Baker's life and music. At times, the story that Gaven chooses to tell is overcome by his fascination with Baker's drug abuse, but that too is part of Baker's story, and it deserves to be faced squarely. Very helpful is Gavin's knowledge of exactly how other musicians viewed Baker's meteoric rise to the top, and his overall sense of the jazz milieu. A very enjoyable and informative read."
3,Burying the dead,"Chet Baker never made an album that could not be dismissed. That's Gavin's underlying theme. But I think Baker's music will be listened to long after this bio is out of print. The author deserves high marks for his research effort, but the mountain of detail he compiled for ""Deep in a Dream"" seems to have had only one purpose: to bury Baker one more time.They say that the work of any artist is flawed and that we don't appreciate the artist's work because of the flaws but in spite of them. Fans of Baker don't enjoy his music because they think he was a heroin addict, which he was, or because he charted the same progressive course in jazz as Miles Davis, which he didn't. Gavin may have produced a more interesting bio if he had explored the theme of the Baker's enduring popularity."
2,Looks like a telephone book & feels like a telephone book!,"Exit Authority 2000 has lots of information however it's written like a telephone book, with small print! I can't imagine anyone on the road or at a truck stop, thumbing through this book to find a specific service they are looking for! All this information would probably be better on a CD, to be used in a laptop in you RV, or possibly incorporated in an RV satellite navagation system."
2,Mystery in Acambaro,Not what I expected. I was able to finish it in 2 hours. I really thought that more evidence would be presented to build a strong case for modern day dinosaurs.
3,Not complete enough for me,"I throughly enjoyed 7 UP and 14 UP in South Africa, and while this is a decent follow up, I wish they had spent less time on Arti, Lizette and Willem, and more time on the others. We saw Lizette for about 20 minutes, but not one mention of Tiene. Claudia was interviewed about Shane's death, but no details about her life were given at all."
3,DVD on Africa,"I was somewhat disappointed with the DVD. When attempting to play to a crowd using my computer, the DVD skipped, lines of different colors came into the movie and it went blank. I'm not sure if it was the DVD or computer, however, I was unable to enjoy as I thought I would be able to and use it for a teaching lesson."
4,What you were always afraid to ask about classical music,"This is a highly readable, funny, interesting and technically impeccable account of the world of classical music for the laypeople and the aficionados alike. It has helped me become an active listener, a passionate concert & opera goer, and entirely respected in my musical judgement by my brother the conservatory pianist. Buy it. The only reasons why I do not give it top marks are: the technical explanations are not very clear (if you get technical, get technical, not shy-technical, ok Mike?) and the recommendations for specific works may be too daring for the uninitiated (""Lulu"" for beginners??!!), but then the author lives in New York City (and so do I). I loved ""Lulu"", by the way."
3,poor order filling service,"The product I received was satisfactory however,Motor City Books order filling performance was so poor I will never use them again. They mis-filled the original order and by the time I had finally got it all straightened out a month had gone by. According to Motor City Books they shipped my final selection on Wednesday which I did not receive until over a week later on Saturday. 10 days to ship from Detroit Michigan to Northern Wisconsin ??? NAAAAW !! P--s poor service."
2,"Honey, I love you, even if I am a jerk.","If this is not the last Badge of Honor book, it should be. Griffin has really lost his way. What could have been a good read, is a hackneyed story with characters so wooden they are unbelievable. Matt Payne comes off like a loutish 13 year old discovering sex. Nobody talks like Matt Payne or his honey, Susan. In other words, a good story has been spoiled by uninteresting characters made so by sophomoric dialogue. This is a book you can, and perhaps should, put down."
4,The best book of the series,"I had to take a break from the series for a few months. However now I know that about 10% of the books will be a repeat of previous books so I can pass on back stories. The plots intertwined nicely and weren't as slow moving as the previous book. It fell apart in the end when the main character took an unbelievable route, which happened to wrap up nicely for him. Either way I read it in a day and it was entertaining. I'm looking forward to wrapping up this series and trying some of his other ones."
4,Slow start--but picks up fast!,"This was my first Griffin, but it won't be my last. Once I got into the plot and got the characters straight (not always real easy), I couldn't put the book down. Griffin makes you care about the characters. I especially enjoyed the dialogue and the interpersonal relationships. The ending came as a complete surprise to me. Bring on the next of the Badge of Honor series!"
4,"Good as Usual, However, Somewhat Outdated.","The story line for the book is excellent. It is nice to see that all are moving up the ladder. However, Mr Griffin needs to get some insight into the latest and greatest in law enforcement. I do not know of a law enforcement agency in the country that is not carrying fire power greater than a .38. Most allow 9mm. Also, there are cell phones, and pagers, where ""reach out"" has a whole new meaning. I happened to be in Philadelphia recently, and a ""smooth"" car was coming down the street Code 3. It was up to date, with strobes in the parking lights, and tail lights and strobes on the dash. I thought ""wonder if the is Matthew, Jason, Peter"" ?? Naw, they are looking for a phone. If it had been them, they would still have blinking lights behind the grill. Keep up the good work and keep em coming, only in the late 1990s."
4,"Enjoyable reading, keeps your interest!","It is hard for me to accept that W.E.B. Griffin is just one person, the way he/they turn out novels. I've read the Army, USMC and Police (Badge of Honor series) and have enjoyed them all. The Investigators by necessity does some ""re-hash"" of the past which is boring for those of us that have followed the lives and tribulations Peter Wohl and Matt Payne, et al, but it is no doubt necessary for the first time reader. This book isworth the time as all the other Griffin books always are."
4,Griffin's Best Book in a While,"The Investigators is probably the best WEB Griffin police book in the Badge of Honor series. The action is fast,the characters are more tightly drawn and the ending has a real world flavor about it. Considering the flatness of his last two books, Behind the Lines and Men At War, The Investigators is a very good yarn."
3,It was typical W.E.B. Griffin and I enjoyed every page.,"If you like black and white movies, the 87th Precinct and Charlie Chan, you will love this series. I started The Badge of Honor series with the Murderers and enjoyed it enough to read the entire series. This one had a more T&A then the others and the love story is a bit juvenile so I will say it may be wisely, the last of this series. Granted this book does not tax your intellect, it simply gives you a relaxing read with old friends."
5,Reviewed by 2 groups of 3rd grade ESL students,"1. This book is about Tepui, a boy who lives in the Tropical Rain Forest of the Macaw. The bulldozers and chain sawyers are headed toward the rain forest. Tepui and Dr. Rivero, a biologist, have one more day left to save the rain forest. They need to catch a nameless butterfly, then a rich man will buy the rain forest and name the butterfly after his daughter. Will they be in time? This book is awesome because it has a lot of information about the rain forest and it's a good story.2. This book is about Tepui, an Indian boy. He lives in a Venezuelan rain forest. Tepui and Dr. Rivero (a biologist) have one day to find a butterfly without a name. If they find the butterfly, a rich man will name the butterfly after his daughter, and buy the rain forest. Will they find the butterfly in time? This book is cool because it has interesting facts about the rain forest."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I read every day, so does my 8 year old, and we often read to each other. 10 pages into me reading this one, and we looked each other in the eye and made faces. I can't remember the last time we didn't finish a book. Too many long streams of colors matched with birds we hadn't heard of (and we have almost memorized David Attenborough's Life of Birds, and my son does a couple dozen bird calls from those videos). The illustrations were nice drawings, but honestly, the rain forest is best taught with a visual component. Or perhaps with much better writing."
1,Horrible product,"I've had the same problem as everyone else! Can't use this as a base or a top coat, because if it chips underneath my nail polish, my nail polish chips too. If it chips on top, well, you get the idea. I have like three bottles of this horrible product because I thought I kept getting expired polish, but now I see that might now be the case. Avoid wasting money on this and buy a $10 bottle of OPI base and top coat. Makes my nails last for over a week! Worth the extra $6."
1,Zero stars?,"First of all, don't use this as a base coat. I did it on accident and it feathered my nails.The second time I used this product I used a regular Sally base coat, two coats of Sally polish, and this top coat. I got chips after only a few hours. Also, this top coat made the polish look weird... like it had dots in it/discoloration... it's hard to explain but it seemed like the chemicals in the two Sally products were at war.The third time, I used a Maybelline polish and I didn't get any weird dots or discoloration. This polish makes a nice shiny top coat, but this is supposed to be a NO CHIP polish. Doesn't work. I got chips in less than 12 hours. I was careful to really get the edges of my nails, too.I'd be happy to find something that gave me two days of pretty nails!"
1,Horrible,This top coat is horrible. In my experience it doesn't always apply evenly and chips within a day. I've even had it start horribly chipping within 2 hours of application. Don't waste your money on this.
1,do not buy,"I bought this polish 'cause of the no chip future.....well big mistake, i painted my nails this morning and tonight when i was washing lit' bit of dishes, most of it came off....never seen that before and i've tried many brands....horrible, horrible, horrible...they should discontinue this product....."
1,Super duper worst thing ever.,"Was looking for a new topcoat and decided to give this a try. Worst idea ever. Used it as a base coat and a top coat for my OPI polish. Peeled the entire manicure off in THREE HOURS. Tried it as a top coat on Ulta brand plain white tips. Shattered the polish underneath and chipped off within two days. Absolutely terrible, and after multiple attempted tries, I'll be throwing it in my nylon drawer to use exclusively to stop runs."
1,Should have read the reviews before buying :(,"As my title says, I should have known better than to purchase on a whim. I usually don't do my nails because of my jobs, but decided to be girly for once and attempt a manicure. I suppose I did pretty good with three days before it chipped, but it cracked all over the nail before doing so - making my polish look like drying mud under the sun.I retried (thinking it was my ineptitude and lack of experience) after watching several DIY manicures - I trimmed, buffed, filed, removed all oils from my nail bed - even bought drying drops. And same thing happened. Cracks, then chips and within the same day, or next day. I tossed it in the trash and ordered Essie's Good to Go top coat. At least that one seems to have a decent rating."
1,worst top coat ever,"I didn't buy the top coat from this buyer but I need to let people know that this is a piece of crap & it's not even worth one star! It made my polish chip next day, My sister bought this top coat & her polish chips within 2 days, she had been using it for a month now & had no idea why her polish chipped & my last 2 weeks. So I decided to try it & next day my nails looked horrible it cracked like paper & had air bubbles this top coat needs to be discontinued!"
1,Save your $...buy the cheap New York Color (NYC),I have used this product over nail polish and on bare nails. Either way it is awful. My nail polish chipped faster when using this product than with no product at all. I would recommend the NYC brand. It's much cheaper and seems to help my nail polish stay on.
1,This top coat is horrible!,"I bought this product trusting the name of course, I have bought Sally Hansen products before with no issues but this has to be the worst top coat I've ever used. It is tough to apply because of how sticky it is and after it begins to dry there are bubbles forming under the top coat! It's horrible after spending time trying to perfectly do my nails. As well as the bubbles, within 24 hours the coat cracks and causes the nail polish to come off with it. It is definitely not a ""no chip"" top coat. DO NOT waste your money and buy this product or you will have to re-do your nails the next day. I am going with the OPI top coat, much more worth it."
1,Worst product!,"I painted my nails this morning at 10, by 3pm my nails showed cracks and it's already starting to chip. Worst top coat I've ever used!"
1,"Brittle, bubbly, terrible.","I bought this topcoat at the drugstore when I left my other bottle of top coat (Seche Vite) at work. I love Sally Hansen products, and I've used the Dries Instantly top coat with no complaints at all. This one, however, was different. Quick-drying to a hard, shiny finish that began to crackle within 24 hours. Eventually it started to chip and crack right off, taking the polish with it. It also trapped little bubbles in it, no matter how hard I tried to apply it smoothly (I'm quite proud of home mani skills ... this wasn't all user error). The bubbles went all the way down to the nail as the top coat dried, and left my dark polish with tiny flesh-colored bubbles showing through! It's one of the very few items I've ever purchased that I was so disgusted with I marched right back to the store for a refund."
1,Worst nail product ever!,"It made my nail polish chip! I thought that the polish was crappy because it chipped the same day! I reapplied color and ""no chip"" and it was worse. I had to take it all off.I've tried the same polish with Nailtiques 2 Plus, and I held up to TWO WEEKS!!!!"
1,Extremely Disappointing,"When I first applied this top coat, I was really excited because it looked AMAZING - my nails were incredibly shiny and looked indestructible. Unfortunately, the next morning I woke up to find that much of my nail color had already flaked off. That day at work, the flaking got worse and worse, and I had to remove my nail polish that night because it looked so bad. Even worse, it took FOREVER to remove with nail polish remover. Sally Hansen usually makes great products, but this one is a dud."
1,Major shrinkage and chipping,"The chipping is pretty bad, but worst is that after I did my nails and went to bed and the next day the polish had pulled back from my nail base so my nails look really bad. It is also stringy and chips very fast."
1,"Should be called ""Chip Fast""","My polish chiped the same day! Much faster than if I had used no top coat at all. I even tried just this polish by itself and same thing- chipped and peeled within 12 hours. I tried filing & buffing, made sure I washed my hands to remove oils before polishing- nothing worked. It just chipped and peeled right off. This was a waste of money, only use now is to stop runs in pantyhoes. Do not waste your money. The Diamond Strength nail color works much better, usually lasts 7-10 days with no chipping and does not need a top coat."
1,DONT BUY THIS!,"This is one of the worst products I have ever used. Just like everyone says it peels off like crazy. At first I thought it was just my nails, but nope it seems to be a common problem with everyone. It is completely useless to even use this product. It makes me wonder if they even tested this product before launching it. I mean seriously why is this even on the market. It reminds me of the peel off nail polish I would wear as a kid. Im giving it one star although, I am not even sure it deserves that."
1,chipped within 10 hours!,"I bought this top coat because it says right on the packaging ""no chip"". I put it on before bedtime and made sure it dried completely before I went to sleep. After I woke up I folded the laundry and three nails on my non-dominant hand had the polish chipped off halfway down the nail! 50% of the nail was uncovered! From folding soft fluffy towels! I had to write a review to warn others. A coworker recommended something called Pro FX Complete 3. It's a base coat, strengthener, and top coat in one. It's been working great so far. Also, Revlon Color Stay Top Coat works pretty well too. Would give this Sally Hansen Acrylic Top Coat zero stars if I could. I generally like their products, too."
1,Lieeeess,How is it called no chip when it chips and peels off? Messed up my design n everything smh ugh
1,same day chipping,"Bought it from the store. When I used it and let it dry about half the day through my nail polish started peeling off. I tried it again with a different nail polish color, and it did the same thing again. Threw it in the trash, this stuff is no good, I wish I looked at the reviews online before I spent my money."
1,the worse top coat ever!!,"I practically bought this because my Orly nail polish chips fast, unfortunately after two days my nails were all chipped at the tips, even worse than if I had not applied this top coat. Seriously?? did they test this product before launching it??"
1,Horrrrrrrrrible!!!!!!,Chipped the same day. I even waited until the next day to apply and it still chipped. Don't buy it!!!!
1,Worse,Ok so I love Sally Hensen Products it's my go to brand when it comes to my nails but this is the worst product I've come upon. 2 hours after I did my nails They looked like a broken mirror.
5,not worth $130,this cds good but its not worth 130 dollars.u can buy this on towerrecords.com for 15 dollars.
5,old memphis classic,tight 2nd album from memphis rap pioneer.I have a few out of print al kapone cds still sealed 4 sale as well as lots of others. email.
1,Disappoinment,"I thought this was the video, not just the soundtrack, so it had entirely no value at all for us"
5,Great product; best price,you ...... will ........... love .......... this .................. series ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........
1,Watered down Bonjovi : (,"If you piss in a bottle, is it beer?This CD tastes just like that, & goes down just about as well.Save your $ for a real CD."
2,dodgy,"This album did nothing for me, a big disappointment from my favorite axeman Tracii Guns, and his mates. Sounds like a bad '80's disco. 2 stars is being generous."
4,What a wonderful story,"This is one of those stories that touches you. From the outset many different story threads begin. Almost immediately you lose yourself understated narrative flow. I was very impressed with the thoughful performances of Clea DuVall and Alan Arkin. Just when you think you know somebody, they can surprise you with depth you didn't think they had.It's obvious to see why this tiny little art film could attract good talent, because real actors live for this kind of meat to chomp on. The story is real and finely woven and Matthew McConaughey gets to show us a broad range, if at times a little over the top. Clea DuVall shines. I expect great things from her in the future."
3,Interesting and Great Cast,"I picked this movie up because I am a big Alan Arkin fan. I was also intrigued by the cast and the concept. There are very good performances here by Arkin, and John Tuturro and the rest of the large cast which includes Matthew McConaughey. The movie has a lot of dialogue and is basically a bunch of smaller stories that we come to find are all linked in some way. It is a thought provoking and very emotional movie and will pull you in a lot of different directions. Interesting concept and good acting. Not a great film but well worth watching."
3,Characters worth getting to know,"It's actually closer to seven or eight conversations about four or five things, though most of those things admittedly touch some way on the theme of human interaction. But no matter-- this is a thoughtful and well-acted movie laced with humanity, and featuring yet another terrific Alan Arkin performance. The movie is also pretty funny at times, and clever without being too impressed with its cleverness. And the movie looks and sounds really great on DVD."
4,Not bad. Only the editing could be better.,"This is a quite French styled movie and nicesly scripted, only with some gliches garbled by uncleared editing. But in general, this is a good movie and should be watched when you have the energy to stay focused and wouldn't fall asleep during watching the slow going of it. Casting is good, script is good, performance is good, except the ""circling"" which linked every part of the whole story together. The deputy DA and the girl he hit and run parts should be a little bit more clearly scripted and developed. All in all, this is a rarely good movie about Life itself, nicely scrpted, performed with a feather touch to the heart, leaving you with no such great feelings as any great movie that might cast certain impact in your realistic life, only shaking your head when you stood up to take it from the dvd player."
5,Brilliant and Literate,"This is the finest film I've seen in a long, long time. All the actors were superb in their roles, but the real star here is the script--it should be nominated for best original screenplay absolutely. Philosophically coherent and thought provoking, the film is NOT depressing to watch, as some here have claimed, because it is often enlivened by ironic humor. It is hard to characterize these comic moments, but they are similar to those you see when you observe revealing little dramas going on around you in public places like malls and grocery stores.The central questions the film asks: are human beings essentially alone in the universe or are we all connected? and is it possible to achieve happiness? are questions every human being struggles with, and the film answers these questions by suggesting that the two questions are linked. The way we answer the first determines the answer to the second.This is a DVD I will be adding to my collection the instant it is released."
5,Amazingly Creative Film,"This undoubtedly is one of the best films I have ever seen. However, it will make little sense if you watch it in pieces. If you watch it all at once, it will leave you awed and intrigued. It is possibly the most creative movie I've seen in a long time."
2,This movie was such a downer..... I hated it!,"I am definitely a ""glass half full"" type of person so maybe the people who gave this movie more than 3 stars all LIKE being depressed, down and out and are generally unhappy people. I just didn't get it. I continued to watch it hoping SOMETHING good would happen to SOMEONE but it wasn't to be. Interesting way to wrap up the story though so I gave it 2 stars instead of one star but honestly, I wish I had not even watched it at all. Had to buy it because our library doesn't have it and usually they have everything. Glad they don't as people do not need to see this type of depressing movie. Yuck...hated it."
5,Arkin deserves an Oscar,"The film is outstanding, as you can see from the other reviews. I would like to add that Alan Arkin's acting is brilliant. He is simply a very under rated, under stated actor, who shines in this movie. He is reason enough to see this film."
2,Exceptional artistic work but what an awful after-taste!,"And so the world if full of mean people, so the worst happens to the best of us, so there may be a second chance, and even the super jerks can break a smile now and then. And so, may be all this can happen to each one of us and we might gain some wisdom from it... And so by the time we get to breathe... we may have grown so messed up that it may not matter any more. This movie may be the biggest single pessimistic brain-abuser (I'll spare your from the F word) in the history of cinematography. As a piece of art it deserves 5 stars but I just can't ignore the bad, bitter after-taste from watching it."
1,"""If things are bad, they can always get worse""",""" Thirteen Conversations About 1 Thing"" is like 60's French Existentialist film on Quaaludes. The main message seems to be ""If things are bad, they can always get worse"". and ""If things are good, they will get bad"". How to make yourself worried and depressed in a hurry!"
2,Not satisfying,"I just don't quite ""get"" this film, nor do I see where all the positive reviews came from. The film is comprised of vignettes focused on four basic groups of characters: lawyers, office workers, cleaning ladies, and college professor. But almost nothing exciting or remarkable happens in this film, nothing that really made me wonder what would happen next or how this film would turn out. We basically start the movie with John Turturro's story of being a late to home husband with a bruise on his eye that came from some encounter a few days before then we're brisked off to McConaughey's piece about a positive man who runs into some bad luck following a sermon he gives to a man at the bar about him not ever being unhappy. The rest of the stories interweave into each other before it's all done, which is an interesting concept, but it's been done much better in other films."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Ok, i was excited to see this movie, and it was highly recommended by a trustworthy source. Maybe I missed something, but this movie was BORING. It's one of those twisted plots where all the characters are strangers but are brought together by strange twists of fate. Sounds like a decent premise, but it didn't work. I literally fell asleep (and I wasn't tired folks), and had to watch it again just to try to figure out what i had to be missing. Well I wasn't missing anything. The movie is so slow its hard to miss anything (good luck staying awake!) sheer poop"
4,13 IS A LUCKY NUMBER,This is a touching film finding magic in the bleak urban landscape of New York City and a handful of residents at life altering moments. It's interlocking stories build to a warm blanket of security and good will under the ominous tone of a sky-less New York. It's funny how things turn out. I was certain I was going to dislike this film.
2,An average anime,"First..Why is it called Psychic Wars, when it has nothing to do with pschics or anything of that nature? The movie itself has decent animation and adequate fight scenes...but the story is confusing and a tad boring. I wonder why the developers didn't spend more time with it. My advice is to rent it first and make a decision from there..."
5,out of the ashes the ressurection of an addict,"this book is a must for anyone struggling with addiction/alcoholism. Joelis direct, honest, and encouraging as he tells his own amazing story offalling and rising from drug addiction.as a mother of a struggling alcoholic I needed to read this book to beaware and hopeful that a future is on the horizon for my daughter. Joel definitely delivered and taught me what true recovery is all about.may anyone who need's hope find it in this book."
3,Needs to be brighter for interior use.,"This is a good enough instrument, but it doesn't work well for interior use. We do interior woodwork, and even with a pair of those red glasses, the line is almost impossible to see in a room that has any amount of natural light or light from a work lamp. Also, the line seems to ""pluse"" instead of being a constant line and gives the illusion of jumping up and down.Bottom line? This instrument needs to be brighter and faster for interior use.Ed WilliamsGreat American Carpentry Co.Dallas, Texas214-352-4030"
4,"Bright and clear, needs some adjustment","These knobs are great and shipped very quickly. I think they are worth the $7 each. My only complaint is that each knob came with 2 differently sized screws (one short, one long) and neither fit my drawer correctly. I will have to cut them down or buy better fitting screws before I can use them correctly. I also seem to have been put on a 'Period Living' catalog mailing list as a result of this purchase (I am assuming it was the knobs, nothing else I buy would fit in the 'period' category)."
2,Not impressed!,"I bought this in place of my usual topcoat (Opi) hoping to save myself a trip to another store to purchase Opi. I was not impressed with the Mega Shine. It was not nearly as shiny as my regular topcoat. I can't say if it would extend your manicure for 10 days, as I didn't even like it enough to leave it on. I went back out to purchase Opi to finish off my nails with a nicer shine."
4,A thumbs up from this corner,"""Change in the Weather"" serves as an apt title for this collection of sun-drenched soul-flavored songs. Erik Lindell stakes his place as a songwriter and vocalist to be watched (and heard), offering an updated perspective on the old ""blue-eyed soul"" cliché by infusing his songs with plenty of funk, blues, and rock energy and not sounding like a hundred other vocalists. There is a nod to the various jam-bands out there, but Mr. Lindell avoids getting mired in extended, pointless jamming.I cannot jump in with five stars as some songs for a couple of reasons: I think a couple of songs are overproduced and bogged down by horns and on one number the lyrics just plain grate me. Still, a thumbs up from this corner and an appreciation of something fresh."
4,Requiem for a wounded warrior,"This disk was released as a commemorative of the artist's tragic death from AIDS in 1988 and contained what one must call ""bootleg"" recordings of Ledroit's concert appearances. Well, they somehow cleared this with the estate (don't ask me how) and the disk is now for sale! Henri Ledroit was the most compelling, charismatic voice in the business. He wasn't actually the best singer of his counter-tenor day, but his voice has an ineffable melancholy that touches from beyond the grave. The recording features some rarities, a Cesti cantata and a Jomelli aria, of varying degrees of success. Ledroit had his good days and his not so good days, and we get a little of both. Vivaldi's Stabat Mater is deeply felt, his Handel and Scarlatti a shade less so, but are musts for the serious Ledroit fan. I also recommend buying the disk for the booklet that comes with, giving us a truly informative and touching portrait of the artist."
3,Strong 80's-pop sound,"I was not a fan of this paticular era's sound and this is an 80's-entrenched effort. Overproduced, plastic, superficial, and yet Gregg has gathered the finest musicians, the best production equipment/technology to create a really good album if you are a fan of this period's sound. If you are any kind of fan of Journey, Cars, Loverboy, Eddie Money, etc...then you really should enjoy this album; and I don't mean that as a slur! ""Gregg Rolie"" is an excellent, albeit dated, album of the 80's sound."
5,Excellent Overview,Have you ever wondered why any country would have chosen to espouse the ideology of Adolf Hitler? How did the Axis form? This book offers an excellent overview of the policital and social climate leading up to World War II. Abundant photographs support the text. I recommend this book high as an introduction to understanding this difficult period of human history.
4,historically important,"The piano solos on this CD are historically and musically important, recorded for the Library of Congress late in Morton's career. The piano solos on tracks 8-18 are excellent, and the half-hour blues ""The Murder Ballad"" is--interesting. However, be warned--the lyrics to ""The Murder Ballad"" are crude and possibly obscene. I am rating this as highly as I am because of the quality of the later material."
4,Comprehensive!,"An excellent reference for anyone planning activities along or near the Chattahoochee. Only shortcoming is general lack of river section and lake maps. The extensive narrative descriptions of noteworthy sites and interesting areas are great and the provided directions help, but some more maps would be very beneficial."
4,Very Informative,"I purchased this book for research -- and wasn't disappointed. Detailed maps, geographical information, history and folklore blend to make this the perfect ""bible"" for anyone writing or reporting on this major geological riparian feature in north central Georgia."
1,the tape surface teared-off due to strong adhesive.,"Length:: 1:31 MinsI have bought this product 5 rolls, since I've read all the good review, however the product that arrive was useless, since the camo patterned surface of the tape was teared-off due to strong adhesive of this duct tape. I spent $8.29 each, not to mentioned shipping cost and custom duty that cost me more.I know that I can claim for this kind of defective, however the cost is not worth to do so.MOBU Camo Duct Tape 2""x20'"
1,Does not fit 1996 Silverado,"These screws do not fit 1996 Silverado front discs as listed. They are way too small and completely wrong. Therefore I cannot comment on how they work, but I will say that I also ordered the Russell 639520's for the rear. Those fit, but did not seat correctly and did not work AT ALL. I would avoid these products like the plague. Stick to manual 2-person bleeding."
5,"Thank you Newport News, VA; Mariners Museum!","This is one of the best White Star Line Titanic books I own. As a Titaniac I find the pages of this book to be seen many, many times. Having been to the touring exhibit in Norfolk, and the exhibit at The Mariners Museum I appreciated the effort. This would make one want to visit The Orlando, FL musuem instead of those other things like Universal, or Disney World. Any Titanic, Olympic, or Britannic enthusiast would love this book to add to his/her collection."
4,Same story over and over,"While I did enjoy the book, most particularly the title story, maybe 5 of the stories have the same conceit--something happens to move someone through time. Whether it's an experimental drug or a physics experiment or a bump from a streetcar, the character is moved to another time and there's the story. Wyndham writes well and this is a quick book, but whoever edited this should have built in some variety. Nonetheless, 4 stars"
3,It's OK...for a dead form of communication,"If you enjoy research, reading the early fathers' sermons, keeping up with your Latin,or simply and old time Catholic that is more than ready for the Holy Father to allow a Latin Mass you need this dictionary. The missal is sure not going to tell you what the word means and even ""Hail Holy Queen"" looses something in translation. It is an adequate resource but for the money it is a great resource."
1,Not enough definitions to be useful,"I bought this book to help me translate the Vulgata, wich is the Latin Bible, and although it is purported to be a dictionary of Ecclesiastical, or Church Latin, it is missing a large amount of words. On the first page of the Vulgata there are about a dozen words wich are not listed in this book.There are five words in the first 4 verses of Genesis alone that are not defined by this dictionary. How in the world does a dictionary of Church Latin not allow you to understand the Latin Bible. The author should be sued for fraud."
2,Not as useful as I expected,Time and place matter in Medieval Latin. I thought this dictionary would help with words introduced to Classical Latin by the rise of Christianity and with the altered sense of other words but I rarely found what I needed. Googling worked better than this volume.
4,Good if you know Latin and want a specialized dictionary,"This is not a general Latin dictionary. If you are learning Latin, you are better served by the Collins Gem Latin Dictionary. However, if you already know Latin and want a reference specifically for Latin as used in Ecclesiastical documents, this is a good reference. Remember that it is a specialized subset. Think of it like a ""Dictionary of Medical Terms"". You would not use that dictionary to learn English, and you would not use this dictionary to learn Latin. You need a general Latin dictionary to compliment this one."
3,Good dictionary,"This dictionary contains terms that one would need to know for reading Church documents. Unfortunately, I give it three stars because it only goes from Latin-English. If you're trying to write in Latin, you'll be quite frustrated and need to find another dictionary. But if you're simply reading, this book will do the job admirably."
3,Great storage box,"Great storage box, clever play mat.....however, that's basically all you get. I was so shocked to open this and find only 2 tiny dinosaurs! Really? For $20 you'd think they could include a few more than 2!"
1,This box smells nasty.,"I'm generally not anti-plastic-toys but this box had that toxic plastic-vinyl smell even after months of use AND leaving it open to air out. Not sure what it is made of, I assume vinyl. I sent it off to goodwill, perhaps its odor will not be so offensive to another family. I never felt good about letting my kid play with it. I gave it 3 stars for durability because I think it will probably outlast the planet."
4,We love it!,"My son keeps LOTS of dinosaurs in this. He is 3, and he is able to unzip it to play and zip it to put away. He takes it everywhere--I only wish it could be bigger. I think we will buy an additional playmat to set out all of the dinosaurs, which are able to fit inside for storage. The medium sized dinosaurs (5"" to 8"") tend to take up a lot of the play space. Overall, this was a great buy, and I'm very pleased with it."
4,dinosaur + playmat + storage = FUN,"This is a very good bin for storage its great that it can be used as a play mat. The only thing is pictured that it has long handles. The long handles would have been better for moving from place to place. The handles on the one I recieved was short, kid love playing with the mat and dinosaurs kept them happy for a long time. Its a must to purchase more dinosaurs makes it more fun for the children. As it only comes with 2 dinosaurs,"
5,Dinosaur zip bin review,Purchased this for Christmas for a 3 year old girl who is into dinosaurs right now. She loves it. I also purchased additional dinosaurs and a real nice dinosaur book that was recommended by Amazon.com which was very colorful and great pictures. She loves it. She has a lot of fun pretending and setting up the scene on the mat. The mat is cool as it is a scene with water and mountians that dinosaurs would have roamed in and you can place the dinosaurs on the mat and play. Parents love that everything fits inside the bin for easy pick up and travel if they wish to take it to grandparents.
4,love these Zip Bins!,"These Zip Bins, all sizes, are a great find! This medium (or classic) size is the best for at home play. They are roomy and sturdy enough to hold a ton of accessories and the playmat is nice a big! I recommend a combination of several in this size and a few minis for travel and for when play time can't be a huge set up and clean up production. We also got the unicorn, farm and space minis, the Fairy Castle medium, the train medium basket, Superstar Condo Meidum Basket and just ordered a few more! I also got the dozen dinos set with this one."
4,For young dinosaur lovers,Our grandson loves this dinosaur set. I only gave it four stars because it came with only one dinosaur. A few more would have been nice. I bought a set of plastic dinosaurs from our local discount store.
4,Love this toy.,My two grandsons (ages 4 and 6)loved the Dinosaur Play Set. They not only use for dinosaurs--they fill it up and carry it all over with other treasures. A great purchase.
5,Great gift for dinosaur lovers!,"Bought this for our 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas and filled it with miniature dinosaurs, the book ""How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night,"" a ""Land Before Time"" video, and the Leap Frog Explorer ""Digging for Dinosaurs"" game. She was thrilled!"
3,"One MAJOR thing to be aware of, which I think is borderline fraudulent...",".. they give the impression that it's your own portable kind of dinosaur-jungle, but very sneakily the two dinosaurs that you can see through the blister pack are ALL THAT YOU GET. That's it, 2 non-moveable dinosaurs and nothing else other than the big box. Come on, plastic costs almost nothing, they could have put a dozen in there easily. So now we're faced with having to go out and find some place that sells a small bagful of them so my son can actually play with it properly. The idea is good, be able to pick them all up and carry them conveniently, but with only 2 small dinosaurs my lad could carry those in his pockets easily without the box. We felt ripped off, but I wasn't going to say ""hate it"" / 2 stars on the review because he does like it, just gets bored quickly because there's so little there"
5,Good for our three year old boy,Our three year old seemed to really enjoy this. As a start it was great fun just putting things in and out of the box itself but the dinosaur aspect is also a hit.
2,Good idea.. But disapponting,"Bought this for Christmas for my 3 year old grandson, he loves it but the lid is much to large for the box. I expected a larger storage box too."
3,Buyer be aware...only 2 dinosaurs included,"From the pictures of the item, it looks like there are several to many dinosaurs included in the package. No where in the description does it state that only 2 dinosaurs are included. I had to view this item on another site to get the details. The mat is cute and extra dinosaurs can be ordered separately."
5,Awesome!!!!,"I bought this for my daughters second birthday and it was a winner. To quote her ""I love it!!"" . I do recommend buying more than 12 dino's its a big box."
4,Great little case for kiddos,"I love this little case, as does our 4 year old. She likes to make believe with dinosours a lot and this starts the stage for more imaginative play. I love the ease of it to zip up and the velcro on the lid. When we travel on trips we fill this with animals and some books. It's just the right size to fit between the two car seats in the back."
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my four year old son who is obsessed with Dinosaurs. He absolutely loves it. The great thing about it is that he can keep all of his dinosaurs in it. Unzip it, have a play area then an easy clean up by just zipping up the sides with the dinosaurs in it. The only thing is that it only comes with a few tiny dinosaurs. So make sure you buy some to put in it."
4,Fun and keeps toys neat,"Santa bought this for my daughter this past Christmas so she could have something to not only play on, but also to neatly contain her dinosaur collection. Well, this play mat certainly does both. She enjoys opening it up and zippering it shut when she's done. It's so convenient and fun for her to have the storage site of her collection open up to little world for her beloved dinos."
4,Worth the money,"The storage box is adorable and I love that it folds into a playmat. The dinosaurs that came with it were much smaller than I expected them to be though, and for some reason I thought there would be more detail in the playmat scene. As of this writing, my 2 1/2 year-old son's favorite thing to do is zip and unzip the sides of the storage box and to put his animals and dinosaurs in it at the end of the day."
4,Fun toy,I purchased this for my 3 year old nephew who is crazy about dinosaurs. It's great to unfold and play dinosaurs on it and it is nice that you can clean up your mess by dumping all the dino toys back in the case.
4,Dinosaur Playmatt/container,"It is a good product, my son loves it. As do my other children. It is nice to put most of his Dinosaurs into when done playing. It is fairly easy for the kids to turn the mat from a mat to a box quickly and without help."
4,Gave as a gift,"I gave this item as a Christmas gift. The boys seemed to like it; they are between the ages 6 and 8. They like dinosaurs, so this gift was ideal for them. They also use it to keep thier other dino toys in it."
4,Dino-lovers delight,We got this and a set of dinosaur figures for my 5 yr. old nephew for Christmas and he really loves it. His parents like that they can easily take it along to the grandparent's house for portable fun and it provides a storage spot for the figures as well. So far it has proved to be durable and fun for an energetic dino-lover.
4,Great for travel but a bit flimsy,"My son had this at his old preschool and loved it so I decided to buy him one for home. I like that this folds up making clean up easy for my son. I wish all his toys did this, maybe then his playroom would stay clean.The material and construction does seem a bit flimsy ive seen what it looks like with a lot of use at a school though for normal use it should be fine.Would be nice if it included dinosaurs."
4,Fun but not as durable as I thought,I love the idea of being able to store toys in a box that folds out into a play mat. I only wish it was made with something more durable than carboard under the wipe clean surface. The box looks great in his playroom but I put a stuffed musical bear on top and now that side has bent inwards. I was going to buy some other designs but I am afraid if I stack them on top of each other the box will lose its shape. But once we fold out to the play mat feature our son has a blast in his own dinosaur world.
5,It's lasted over a year so far...,"We got this for our dinosaur-crazy 3-year-old last year. He is now four, and still plays with the dinos. Plus, he's taken the whole box of dinosaurs on a car trip, and it all survived. The fact that the storage box is a landscape is brilliant; he has always even liked putting them away, because the zippered box is nifty. Great toy!"
2,"One of the Better Tracks from ""Tissues and Issues""","MOODSWINGS (To Come at Me like That)is probably one of the better songs from Charlotte's new album. Still, it's not worth your money! Her voice has a rasp to it, and it's also very breathy. It must come from her constant smoking and drinking (alcohol, of course). The album has become a FLOP, and this is only helping! Sorry Charl, but not worth it!"
1,Blank CD,"There are no songs on this CD. I contacted the seller who said return it and they will refund my purchase price. The cost of a CD envelope and postage exceed my purchase price. I contacted the manufacturer, Sony BMG, about available options and they did not even have the courtesy to respond. Needless to say this transaction leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
5,"Excellent puppy! Cute and soft, a real winner!","I was searching for a new Murphy for so long! When I found him I was ecstatic! My son had 22 surgeries in 1.5 years. Murphy was his constant companion, he still is."
5,Aurora Plush Murphy Flopsie,"I have three great grand children,and had purchased two of the Aurora plush dogs at a Stein Mart store,and thought I could pick up the third one at another Stein Mart. I checked a couple more stores,and none to be found. . Went to Amazon.com,typed in the brand and what it was,and bingo,the same plush toy. This was right before Chistmas,and I was worrie that I would not get it in time.In a few days,the toy arrivied at my door. I was very pleased,and my grand children were too!!"
2,Not what I ordered,"The dog it cute but it is nothing like the photo, it is huge. Though it looks similar it is not what I ordered. The dog's coloring is different around the head and eyes. It is bigger in general, it is not what I was expecting. The ""fur"" it really long and poofy. The dog looks a lot like Aurora Plush 28"" Maddy Super Flopsie, but with brown instead of pink and no bow. Is there any way I can get what I ordered?"
5,The BEST Overall kickboxing workout!!,"I loved this workout!! There were tons of fun kicks and Aaron gives clear instruction and cueing throughout the workout, which is a tough workout! I think beginner and advanced people could do this workout. It is a whole hour, which I loved because most videos are too short to give me a completely worked out feeling. The things I liked most were that there were more kicks than TaeBo and Aaron used this great visual cue where you would be visualizing an attacker. ""Kick this guy and punch his buddy on the side!"" To me, it made the workout more empowering and I felt like I was learning some self defense. I bought this tape from Collage in January and I still love it. I hope Aaron makes tons more tapes. I 'll be in line!!"
5,A great workout!,"This is the best kickboxing video I have ordered (and I have several). The workout is fast-paced, but yet easy to follow. Mr. Lankford shows you how to do the kicks/punches at the beginning of the tape, thus allowing you to proceed throughout the workout without interruption if you choose. I felt as if I received both a great upper and lower body workout, and was able to use a punching bag for many of the upper body punches. He is extremely motivational; he talks occassionally to remind you of form/kicks etc. but does not interrupt the flow of the workout. I wish that he would develop another video. I would definately buy it!"
2,Odd and 80ish,"After reading all the fabulous reviews of this workout, I decided to purchase it. I'm usually a Janis Saffell girl, but I wanted to try something different. Now I know why I'm a Janis Saffell girl. The tape was really odd. The 2 girls in the background looked like they never stepped into a gym before and Aaron was strange looking as well. The tape is a new frills, low budget, horrible music type workout. In addition to that, they are no hooks or uppercuts, which I find strange in a kickboxing workout. If you are looking for even the slightest decent music, or even a simple bit of choreography, this is not the video for you. Straight forward, boring and odd. I must have missed the boat with this one, cause I don't see what all the rage is about!"
3,"A good premise, but a disappointing book","It was a good idea to review these episodes in American history, but the events are presented in a shallow, jingoist manner, and were not informative or insightful."
3,i dont received my product yet,"I dont received this product yet, dont came in my house until this moment. What i do now? just a wait? awaiting further guidance"
4,Good Book,This is a good book about sharing. I read it to my students and they seem to understand and enjoy it.
3,Good Book,"The pictures are little illusions drawing of the toys. This book tells the basic toys like viborators, dildos and some sleeves for men. The texts is very informational. It tells what the toy is and what it is used for. If you do not know where to look online for a sex toy this book has a couple pages full of internet sites, but also tell you how to shope in a sex shop without feeling shameful. If you or your partner is thinking about buying a sex toy for the first time and don't know were to turn this book is great for the price and the info it gives you. You won't go wrong here. Read first then go out and shop with confendents knowing what those toys are for."
2,Not as complete as I'd hope for,"This is more of what I would consider a ""pocket sized"" book. No actual photographs of sex toys are included, and though most of the information is correct, it's pretty minimal, and geared more towards heterosexual folks."
3,very uncomfortable,I always purchase Nine West shoes. I was very surprised that this shoe was so very uncomfortable.
4,"Must have with the ""Bongo Book""","If you're trying to self teach, and know little of percussion as I do, this is a ""Must have"" with ""The Bongo Book"". Some of the explanations in the book just weren't getting into my brain. This cleared it up quickly."
1,Very Dissapointed...,"Product did NOT match the picture, very poor quality, should be advertised as a DORK wig!"
1,Do NOT buy,"The Va Va Vamp Wig is defective and I recommend you quit selling it immediately. I am absolutely furious with the ridiculousness of selling a wig that fades when it gets damp. How often do you think someone is likely to sweat while wearing a wig to a dance? Duh!!! I have purchased and worn brightly colored wigs in the past and never had a problem. It never occurred to me that a synthetic wig could be dyed with a water-soluble bright red dye that bleeds bright red on my skin!!While trying it on and trying to style it, I started to sweat. That is when I noticed the red streak across my forehead! Fortunately I did not wear it to an all-night costume ball where I am absolutely positive I will sweat!"
2,nnothing like the image,"I ordered this one for a anime con that I will be attending next week and its the perfect hairstyle for the character. but, sadly - its not shaped like the image shown. its not too bad but not cut as good as the image is showing. I would recommend not buying this one!"
5,Good Adhesive...Easy to Hang,My husband & I put this border up ourselves. We did the whole room (12x15) in just a couple of hours. It definitely makes it a ton easier if you have at least two people. One person dips the paper in a bucket of water and the other person sticks it on the wall. Our baby is 5 months old now & the adhesive hasn't let up at all. It looks great & sticks to paint with no problem.
5,Excellent!,We loved this DVD and highly recommend it to everyone who is wondering about Jesus and who he really is. What a great way to proclaim the Gospel in a contemporary setting. Two thumbs up and a must see!!!
4,Wonderful Movie!,While channel surfing one night I stumbled across this movie and was captured by the ongoing dialogue between the two actors. The one downturn to this movie was the ending that left me wondering if was rushed to completion. It was almost as if the ending was an afterthought that don't connect with the rest of the movie. However this wasn't enough to take away from overall message.
5,A perfect Stranger & Another Perfect Stranger,"These 2 movies are definitely 2 must sees. I rate them Xlnt, for anyone. Buy them and let your friends see them, it surely could not hurt anything, but only do good."
4,Moving -- Thought Provoking,"In a world where Christian theology is often mis-represented (especially by Christians!) ""The Perfect Stranger"" provides a refreshing look into the tough questions surrounding Christianity. This movie is a must for anyone that has ever asked serious questions about God and is willing to investigate the answers.The setting of this movie in a resturant provides great freedom for exchange. Perhaps my only complaint is that this dinner is a little slow ""getting to the table."""
3,Preaching to the choir,"This movie is clearly not meant to convert doubters to Christianity, since the arguments it puts forward would not convince the mildest of skeptics. Instead, it seems to be made to reassure Christians that they have made the right choice. I enjoyed Jefferson Moore's performance, however, and the idea of sharing an expensive dinner with Jesus Christ is an intriguing one."
4,Thoughts about God,I loved this view of God and God's word. I don't know if I entirely agree but I liked it.
4,Great script,The script of the conversation between Jesus and the young women was excellent. The movie was very enjoyable and also thought provoking.
5,Perfect Stranger is awesome & inspiring,"A friend had seen ""Perfect Stranger"" on TV. He could not stop talking about it and how well it was presented. I immediately went to Amazon.com and ordered the movie. We watched the movie. We both are believers and followers of Jesus Christ. We both cried when yet another person was ""introduced"" and invited to Jesus Christ. I will invite others to to share this experience. I also ordered ""Another Perfect Stranger."" I am excited about receiving that one also. There should be more movies that are for families..."
5,The Perfect Stranger movie,This is an excellent film. Well written and acted. A wonderful witnessing tool. Gives you a lot to think about. I highly recommend it for everyone whether Christian or not. Gives real meaning in modern life to the words of Christ.
5,Thought provoking film.,"I was flipping through my Sky Angel the other day and saw this was one of their movies on their videos on demand.Being a Christian and seeing this movie was really challenging. It's almost everyday i wonder what it would be like if Jesus were alive today. This movie made me realize that i should take every person I meet as if they were Jesus, because you never know what might happen.If you guys don't have Sky Angel, you should really check it out. It's great knowing I can watch any of the movies on there with my kids and there won't be a problem."
3,"A few great songs, but overall mediocre","This album has some truly standout songs, but is overall mediocre. The band overuses the overdrive effect on the vocals throughout the album, and the production is repetitive and often jarring. I like this band, and tracks like ""333,"" ""False Profits,"" and ""Noi Boi"" are awesome. But the rest I could do without."
5,Jellyfish Bunny Rabbits are Cool.,"A very deserving 5 stars. If you are a fan of the velvet teen then you will love this cd even though the style is much different from previous work. The CD is jumbled, yet together. It may be my favorite work by the velvet teen to date. And I loooove their old stuff!!! Pick this up, you won't be disappointed!!"
5,It was perfect to get me moving on LINUX,"I wanted to become more experienced with UNIX so I had the Ubuntu distribution installed in my computer. I spent six months having a hard time getting simple things done until I came accross this book.It is organized in such a way that it is easy to get to do what you want/need and, what's better, the explanations provided give you insights on how UNIX works. After a while, you will find yourself doing new stuff on your own.If you want to get into UNIX but knows little about it my advice for you is: get this book and jump into LINUX - it is worth it!"
4,"Very Useful, but it's Hit-and-Miss","Because this is a ""cookbook,"" it gives you recipies -- step-by-step instructions for performing specific tasks.This makes Linux Cookbook EXTREMELY useful when it has a recipie you need, and it often gives you a good starting point when you need to do something that isn't specifically covered.For example, let's say you need to setup a mail server, which you've never done before. As long as you're willing to use the mail tools she describes (which are perfectly good tools), then this book is the fastest way to get the job done. She also shows you how to make sure the server will be secure.I'm glad I have this book on my shelf, I recommend it, and I refer to it whenever I need to do something new in Linux. The problem is, you can't have a step-by-step recipie for everything. When this book hits the mark, it's the best book you can have, but you cannot rely on this as your only Linux book."
4,Quick answers,"I don't need this book. Actually I do. what I really mean is, I did need this book. O'Reilly's Linux Cookbook covers all the issues I tackled as I set up my first Linux server. Installing packages, handling users and groups, Apache, upgrading the kernel. All of these topics and others I don't know I need yet, are covered here. To solve these issues without the Linux CookBook required several books, many Google searches and the eventual bribery of Max, a friend of a friend and Linux guru who came to my rescue.At the moment my server works fine. Everything is up-to-date .... and seems to work. This situation cannot last, and I'm glad the Linux CookBook is available."
3,Not at all for beginners,"Linux CookbookI was under the impression that this was an introduction to Linux for those who know little or nothing about it (its title gives that impression, as well as some of the promotional copy). This is not the case at all. It is highly technical, more of a look-up, reference manual for geeks.If you're looking for a good introduction for the novice, the OTHER ""Linux Cookbook, 2nd Edition,"" by a different author and different publisher, is very good.The Linux Cookbook, Second Edition"
3,After the First Death Book Review,"I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspenseful books, and doesn't mind sad endings. I thought it was interesting the way that although the entire book is written in first person, Cormier switches from character to character so that as the story unfolds you get to see it from more than one point of view. I like the way that Cormier changes his writing style and consequently the ""voice"" of the character that is telling that particular part of the story, so that you get to know the characters individually. Another thing that I liked about this book is that there is no main ""hero"" in the story; all of the characters have their insecurities and mistakes. I'm not sure I liked the way that Cormier really doesn't tie things together until the end. I was pretty lost for the first half of the book. After the First Death was a very disturbing but powerful novel and was a very quick read."
4,More than just a book for young adults,After the first death isn't a book many people have taken the time to read simply because it has been classified as a book for young adults. But it is clear that this book is much more than that from the first page to the last. A classic book about the choices that people are forced to make under distressed. The sometimes tragic consequenses those choices create. The image and the intrigue of the school bus on the bridge is facinating. Just how deeply treaded in madness is the narating general? Who exactly was the first death? Was it physical death or moral? Interesting questions are an excellent book.
4,"look deeper, perhaps?","To those who complain that this book is boring: did you not read Chapter 11? Rather, did you not comprehend it? Maybe I'm just an elitist snob, but if you can't understand the deeper psychological issues in this book in 12th grade, to quote manidia, maybe you really shouldn't be there. I was rather young, also, the first time I read this book (about 11) and I understood it the first time.To any potential readers: if you read this book and don't understand it the first time, <i>read it again</i>. Don't let the surface be all you recognise about this book.Personally, some parts of this book were rather tedious. The Miro/Kate chapters were well developed, but one-leveled. Whilst you discover new things with each reading of the Ben/Mark chapters, this is not so with the ones written in the third person.Otherwise, no complaints."
4,Comment on the book,"This novel is a very exciting and gripping book. The author describes the feelings and thoughts of the characters very well. You get a good look into their thoughts and feelings (almost) identify with them and understand them better. Besides, the language isn`t very difficult so that you can read very quickly and fluently, which as a non-narative speaker, I found a very pleasent and encouraging experience."
4,books for school,"My only disappointment was that I paid for 2 day shipping, but it took nearly 5 days to receive this book."
2,realistic theme,"hii am a student of a small school in good old germany. and yes of course i had to read it. in my opinion this novel is the driest book i ever read. but i think through the attacks of the taliban the story get more sense. and you can see in which ways terrorists think. so you can understand the whole background, their thoughts and feelings better as before. after all it is ok but i am sure it exists better books. (...)"
4,Great Mystery and Frightening!,"Enjoyed the book thoroughly. The ending is shocking! Kind of like his I Am the Cheese, and another book I read called Hampton Road by Segedy that uses similar narrative techniques and has that WOW! ending."
2,After the First Death,I started reading this book because I had to read this book. In my Eng. 12 class we started book clubs. Everybody in my club agrees with me. This book sucks! The way that the book is set up is so confusing. And what is up with cormier and putting a masturbation episode in his books. I believe that when he decides to put that kind of episodes in his books he is talking from a peronal experience.
3,"confusing,fast and destructive","this is a very good book,but the ending was really bad .Not an ending ,rather a prelude to bad sequel. you will enjoy this book ,but the end just puts you off the author,you`ll think ""what was the point of it?"" a good read but if you want 5 or more stars read Dan Simmons"
2,I thought this book was disgusting and inappropriate.,"I had to read the book for a high school class, and I was appauled at the material it contained. Not only did it have somewhat graphic, inappropriate elements, but it seemed very confusing, and hard to follow. I don't recomend this book!"
2,Not a very good book.,"I can't say that this was the best book that I have ever read. I had just recently read it for a 7th grade reading project and I found it to be very graphic, very boring at times, and poorly written. The ending is one of the most confusing endings that I have ever read. The whole book looked like it had been written in the amount of time that it took me to write this review which was about five minutes. This book had some very graphic parts, boring parts, and just cruel parts in it. I would only reccomend this book to a mature student if he/she is interested in reading it. All in all i thought that this book was, to be perfectly honest, one of the worst books i have ever read."
2,I thought this book was very suspenceful.,My favorite part in the story was when they high jacked the buses and captured the children.This story was prity close to being a horror story.You should defenatly go out and get it.
1,Still screaming!,"I don't know how anybody could bear to write this book. It was so creepy! I guess there are a few good parts, but not many. I had to use the book for a book report and it was really freaky. I can't believe I chose it for free choice! Children twelve and under, I don't recommend this book! Please consider this review before purchasing this book for your child or yourself! Consider yourself warned!"
4,Terrorism from Inside,"In my opinion After the First Death is an interesting book. Thereader is able to get a feeling of the terrorists' thoughts and how fanatic they are and can be. I like that the book is written from different perspectives. The reader can see both the victims and what kinds of lives the terrorists have had and how their organization is built up. If you as a reader want to understand the story, you have to take your time and read some chapters twice to understand the author's intention. For a native speaker it's easy to read this book, but for an English pupil it's a challenge.I had to look up several words because they were unknown to me. I didn't like that we never got to know about Ben himself. All we know about Ben we know from his father who is a sick man.I suggest this book to everyone who is interested in getting background information on hijackers and terrorists."
5,A very well written book,"I thought this book was well written, and it kept me on the seat of my pants. I actually read this book in approximately 2 hours, for I could not put it down. It was just two interesting! You've done a great job, Mr. Cormier."
3,"Not a duty, but a pleasure.","in my opinion, ""after the first death"" is a good solution for english-students looking for some literary texts which aren't too difficult to understand. the vocabulary which is used by robert cormier isn't too easy - for students - and you have to look up quite a lot expressions and single words as the author often repeats them again later. the book isn't a cheap thriller you read if you're bored but it's written on a high stylistic level, it consists ofa lot of psychological aspects. i enjoyed reading the chapters dealing with the hijacking itself, miro, artkin and so on but: i was bored by those passages telling the reader about ben and his father in such a boring way at the beginning of the book. thank you."
3,Expected more from a champ,"As a martial artist I'm always searching for new ideas and techniques.I'm a big fan of Oscar and thought this tape would take us inside his training methods but,this tape is really geared toward beginners.There is nothing really new here and the only thing that might be strenous is the extended jump rope sections. The tape is poorly done,you would think they would do a walk through before filming.Oscar and the lady are sometimes out of sequence.Also they talk over each other at times. An ok tape for someone starting a workout program but,a boxer,martial artist,athlete or fitness freak will be dissapointed. Oscar has alot to offer, hopefully in the future he will."
1,Terrible,"i bought this product and tried to insert my Ipod Nano and found it did not fit. I sent it back and got a new one with the same problem. I sent that one back and got a new one and was still unsuccessful at fitting it in the speaker. I finally got a refund. THIS PRODUCT IS INCOMPETENT I DOES""NT WORK PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!11"
2,A disappointment,Was disappointed in this product. Speakers are extremely small and did not fit the nano. We were unable to try out the sound.
1,Christmas Gift Bummer,This was one of the gifts that he was most excited about and it doesn't fit! What A bummer of a christmas gift!
1,does not fit 2nd gen nano,Our kids each received a 2nd gen nano for Christmas as well as these speakers. They do not fit! This is a deceiving product.
3,"Beware-only fits old nanos, not new generation",I bought these for Christmas presents to accessorize new nanos. They don't fit the new generation of nanos (the aluminum ones). They work fine on the original nano ipods and were a good price.
2,Wouldn't fit,"I didn't see anything in the discription about it fitting only the older version of Nano's. I got this for someone for Christmas and we were both very disappointed that it wouldn't fit the new generation Nano. The size was perfect for us, we just wished the Nano would've fit."
5,Portable Stereo Speakers Nano,"I gave this a 5 because of what you get for the money. I am satisfied with this product. Dont buy it expecting bose quality, however it is very much worth the money. Sound is decent, ease of use is excellent."
2,Ipod more important,This little speaker had good sound quality but it was difficult to insert or remove the ipod. We were afraid that we would damage the ipod. The longetivity of the ipod was more important to us so we returned it.
5,This record is loud!!!,"About ten years ago I used to have a tape of this album, then I lost it. I have not heard it since, but this was some of the tightest, straight ahead rock and roll I've ever heard. Please, please, get me a copy"
2,The front cover of this album says it all...,"So this is the great, under-rated, over-looked DUST? Anyone care to guess WHY they were so over-looked? Give you one hint: BORING! Yep, I decided to seek this album out, along with HARD ATTACK, and this album was Sominex City. Their only claim to fame was that the drummer became a Ramone, the bassist became a session dude, and the guitarist produced some Kiss albums. The only redeeming factor is the last tune ""Loose Goose"" and maybe ""From A Dry Camel"". Otherwise, stay FAR FAR away from this nonsense."
5,Love my red zipit,This thing is great. I use it at night when i am lying in bed or when i am just hanging around my house. it is great for when you want to talk to your friends but someone else is on the computer. the only thing i dont like is how there is not a light built or attached so if you are not near a lamp you can not see what is on the screen
3,"Great device, just be careful with it","Okay, on the plus sides:Sturdy feel, lightweight, long battery life, long wifi range, good encryption compatability, lots of IM options, good keyboard.It would have been a great gadget 100% except for the fact it has no backlight and it broke in less than a week. It probably would have lasted longer except for a drop off a table onto hard floor. Glass screen (should be using plastic by now) shattered in lower right corner leaving entire right side of screen unusuable. Lid switch also engadges for no reason, causing it to go into standby at random times. Had potential but durability and reliability are a bit of an issue. If you're careful, it's a great product."
1,No use if it freeze,Bought 4 as Christmas gifts. Too bad ALL of them freeze after a couple of minutes of use. I am returning them as soon as possible and wait for the product to mature.
2,Should have a better description,"This was not at all what I expected it to be. It does not seem to be a heat barrier as advertised. What it is however, is a toxic piece of material that should not be handled with bare hands nor cut without wearing a mask. A detail that should most definitely be listed in the description of this product."
4,Utterly Perfect,"This book (the entire 6 book series of Silver Skates from the late 1980's in fact) is worth hunting down. I first read it when I was ten. Now at twenty-two years of age I still enjoy this series about the ups and downs of serious competitive figure skating. If you enjoy Melissa Lowell's Silver Blades series, this is a step up. Here the writing is more mature, and the skaters are at a more advanced level. This is the best skating fiction has to offer."
1,Leaves me cold,"This novel,which I found dull,involved Claire,a great ice-skater who's dreams are starting to go grey."
5,Tons of Information,"I was amazed at the amount of information in this book. I covers everything: moulding, mat cutting, cutting glass, etc. I can already tell that it will be earmarked and referenced for a long time."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Great history of Rome, but didn't show what we thought it would....wanted more info on current Rome."
5,Love the body Warner's!,These are amazing. I use these to put in my jacket pockets while I'm playing tennis in the cold - when I get the chance to stick a hand in the pocket to warm it up this does the trick! They last longer than the smaller hand Warner's!!!
2,I could hardly read it.,"With the language this book is written in, I could hardly read it. If don't speak in gangster talk, you probably won't be able to finish this book. Asprin could have at least translated Guido's narration for us."
1,Avoid At All Costs,"By the time these books had come out, Robert Asprin had stopped making his Myth books self-contained stories. They were, instead unapologetically episodic, with long, meandering storylines in each book ending in a cliff-hanger meant to lure you into the next book. It was a cheap device used to snag the die-hard fans and new readers who might not know any better.Its hard to think of these books as anything more than a marketting tool, since all the originality and humor present in the first few books of this series had long ago been burned away. Its like Robert Asprin is just noodling around at the keyboard, tossing off ideas to fulfill a contractual obligation. There is no joy in these books at all. At best they present over-used cliches, at worst they are tedious beyond belief."
2,"Great idea, but annoyingly brittle pegs","I had great success with knitting hats on ProvoCraft's small round loom and loved the loom knitting process. These long looms, though, have caused me no end of trouble with the pegs breaking off. When I purchased them, each loom had at least one broken peg (some more than one), and I've had to Super Glue 3-4 more pegs back on since then. The last straw was when 2 pegs snapped in the middle of a project this week, forcing me to pull out all the knitting. ProvoCraft really should look into using a less brittle material for these pegs!"
3,Knifty Knitter Long Looms,"I really love my round Knifty Knitter looms. I like the long looms ok, but I wish they had made the pegs longer, like they are on the round ones. They are really short & it's harder to pull the yarn up over the loops without pulling the whole stitch off."
2,kniffty knitter rectangle loom,"The product was not intially easy to use. The directions were difficult due to the multiple languages on the pages. It also was limiting in that due to so little directions and options unless you are creative and a good visual learner(from what little is on the website) you would become defeated and quit. Also, the availablity of books to expand knowledge is very limited. Please make more so people could really get their moneys worth. Also, some of the words that are familiar to knitters are really unclear for non-knitters and once again, without clear visual and narrative how-tos, it will lead only to defeat. Thanks"
3,Ben Franklin as a vendor,The loom is hard plastic and completely consistent with expectations. I bought thru Ben Franklin Stores and was totally SHOCKED at the shipping fees - I could have bought the looms for the cost os shipping! There were two products on my order (one from another vendor) and it cost what the shipping did so I didn't notice the cost until the order was confirmed. Live and learn and don't buy from Franklin
1,Not in stock,"I've tried several times to order this, as it is listed in stock. However, when I get to check-out, I get the message that it's no longer available.Would be nice they update their stock levels..."
3,It'll Do...,"So I picked up on the loom knitting craze, but tried out a friend's loom first to make sure it was a new hobby I'd like. Well in comparison to her loom these aren't that great. The pegs are too short and the groove is not deep enough, causing one to spend more time on picking up each row than is really necessary. So all in all, the end result is still a great scarf, I just wish the pegs were longer and the grooves deeper. Now I did just receive my round looms from easy Knitting and they are AWESOME, long and deep pegs/grooves.Happy Knitting."
4,My Mom Loved It,"My mom loved making scarves and blankets with this. The only problem is she lost interest in it. Otherwise, works really well!"
4,"Scarves, Cowls and Shawls","I like the product and the weight of it. I made a scarf and a cowl already and I really enjoy how they look. But I've only used two of the sizes, and I can't really figure out what I'd need with the other two sizes, I'm sure there is a project for them somewhere.I wish the pegs were a bit closer for a tighter knit, but other than that I like the looms."
4,Loom Knitting,"I purchased the long loom and round loom sets at a brick and mortar store near my home. Loom knitting is relatively easy for me to learn as it is very similar to the spool knitting I used to do as a child. I've already made a hat and scarf set and I'm still looking for other pattern ideas that are easy for me to practice with. Eventually, I may decide to try a more complicated pattern with these looms."
2,It seemed to be a mens baseball jersey........,"But turned out to be a ladies top....... i gave it to my missus, but she never wore it not really being a fan of the band"
4,Gorgeous,"The color, the lace, and corset-lacing are beautiful. I gave it only 4 stars because the ribbon is too long, and I didn't like the shoulder pads so I cut the ribbon and removed the shoulder pads. Other than that, wonderful jacket!"
4,Stripped-down catechism,"What some dismiss as ""antique theology"" is in reality the eternal truths of the Catholic Faith. Fr. Cogan's book is a stripped-down Baltimore Catechism for adults, focusing on the basics of the Faith with a dash of family-focused pastoral guidance for good measure. It's withstood the test of time since its first edition fifty years ago, and the current version has been updated to reflect the teachings of the Second Vatican Council."
1,A Brief Catechism for Adults: A Complete Handbook on How to,"Antique theology. This is the Catholic Catechism before Vatican II written in the 1950's by Fr. William J. Cogan, a close friend of Senator Joe Mcarthy. This book would make good foder for anti-Catholic propaganists, its stridency, intollerance, and absloutist approach to the doctrines of the Church would frighten away anyone with an IQ over 80. This is not a thinking persons theology, but a recipe book for how to be a Catholic robot. For a short read that incorporates Vatican II try ""The Seekers Catechism:The Basics of Catholicism"" by Michael Francis Pennock. For a comprehensive review try ""This is Our Faith"" by the same author. That the Church has not yanked this book from print is worrisome. It is however a great retrospective view of American culture and the role of religion in the age of Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best, if you read it with that in mind it is good for a few laughs."
1,the worst,"I can summarize this book for anyone who doesn't want to take the time/money to read it:The US is the root of all evil.All problems can be attributed to the US and the UK and The West in general.The Islamic states actually are very peaceful and sophisticated. In fact, they either are very democratic or would be if it weren't for the US.The word joke would apply if only the book were funny."
4,Good Mystery,My first read by Ms. Miller and it was enjoyable. A well written mystery with twist and turns that will keep you turning pages. What She Left Behind is a mystery love story.
1,What a ...,"This book is essentially the same thing as the earlier EssexClass Aircraft Carriers. Whole chapters are nearly identical.The book is basically a very, very sketchy history of US carrierops in WW2 with a very little bit of Independence class materialtossed in. The author probably spent less than 5000 wordson the Independence class itself.Someday someone will write a true history of the class, thisisn't it."
2,Disappointing lack of information.,"I admit that I purchased this in spite of the previous negative reviews due to a personal involvement with the subject matter: my father served aboard the U.S.S. Bataan from prior to her launching to her decommissioning and, briefly, again in the Korean conflict. I had hoped to find some new anecdotes, information or photographs of this vessel. I was disappointed. The book was so very generic as to be stultifying. I can not recommend this work to anyone with even an entry level knowledge of the subject matter."
5,"Amazingly soft, beautiful color","I am in absolute awe at how soft this set is, and how beautiful the color is! My daughter's crib looks like it's from a designer nursery magazine, and I truly wish I could find bedding this soft for myself. Quality is excellent, our crib's size is a little non-standard so we have to really tug on crib bumpers to make them fit well and this one held up great - very durable."
3,"Soft, but kind of cheap feeling","The bedding was soft and did it's job, but sort of cheap feeling. Wish I had spent a little more money and went to the pottery barn."
5,So Cute!,"I fell in love with this bedding forever ago, but I didn't want to pay $150+ for a set. Saw this set online for $43 and snatched it up right away! I love it! It is so simple but so sweet! And because it's white I'll be able to change the color scheme and use it for our next child! Great Deals Amazon!! Thank you!!"
5,Beautiful great quality,"The item looks perfect, absolutely wonderful, could not be happier, my baby boy's room looks great. The quality is great I am so happy that I am able to just throw it in the wash and keep it clean."
5,Great band!,"I was looking for the song ""How You Like Me Now?"" and after listening to the song samples, I figured I would take a chance and bought both ""The House That Dirt Built"" and this album as well. I think I fell in love with both of them after hearing each CD the first time, they are just really easy to listen to. The music has such a unique style. The CDs have quite a variety of style...there is a sound a little like the new Black Keys album, Dead Weather ""You Don't Know"", classic James Brown or The Meters ""How You Like Me Now?"", and some a little more poppy."
2,OK....had higher expectations for the cd,"I bought this cd after seeing them on David Letterman and had high hopes. There are a number of enjoyable aspects to this album (mix of song types, some lyrics, a few catchy songs), but in general the compilation fell far short. If I was buying song by song I might be intersted only in purchasing 1-2 songs."
3,Zen A way of Life,"Great book, though hard to follow and read at times. Really gives a greater understanding to enlightenment, and the path to follow"
5,Nice After-Shave Lotion,"I've tried multiple natural lotions, and found this one to work best. It cools and calms down the skin like no other lotion I've tried."
2,This SACD has some surround sound. Songs just not for me.,"Lionel Richie has made some good songs in the past such as 'Destiny', 'Love, Oh Love' and also 'I Forgot'. Listen to the 'Back To Front' album and most of you will agree with me. However, his latest album, 'Just For You', is very disappointing. The songs (tunes) are not original and are not of the quality that Lionel Richie normally delivers. There is not one song that makes an impression and that stays with you.Furthermore I am not impressed with the surround sound of this SACD. There are some obligatory surround effects but nothing special. Many surround sound super audio cd's are far better than this one. On the other hand it is nowadays more appropriate to release hybrid sacd's, because many listeners have surround sound (multi-channel) systems. That is why I do not give this sacd-album one but two stars."
3,A Bit of a Snore,"Mr. Darwin's Shooter recreates the 19th-century world in language that is baroque, evocative, and almost poetic. The book is filled with impressive learning on almost everything -- from life on sailing ships, to the genocide of Argentina's Indian population, to the nitty-gritty of slaughtering and skinning animals. Unfortunately, information and language don't necessarily make for a great novel. In the case of Mr. Darwin's Shooter, the narrative is glacial, Charles Darwin has only a secondary role, and, contrary to many of the reviews below, the book never grapples with the ""Big Idea"" of Faith vs. Science except in an incidental, indirect way. I liked the book, because I like pretty writing and I'm interested in the 19th century -- but there's no way that I would read it a second time."
4,Mr. Darwin's Shooter,Great book to take with you as you travel through the Galapagos Islands or learning about Darwin's travels.
3,Rich but lacking,"A discussion of one of history's greatest arguments, Mr. Darwin's Shooter is interesting enough to leaf through. Unfortunately, though the language is rich and textured, one never really gets the feeling that the novel has begun. The argument between evolution and religion is never attacked directly enough and the rest of the story is somewhat drawn out and as a result the reader (at least the reader who is under thirty) is left wanting. Nevertheless, for those who are interested in understanding the moral and religious debate that arose around Darwin's ""Origin of Species"", I would reccommend it. Those who are simply looking for good contemporary literature best stay away."
5,A near-perfect book,"This is a totally beautiful book--so well written that it's impossible for this reader to rip it apart and explain why it's so good. An intelligent book, and like it's subject, Syms Covington as conceived by Roger McDonald, rich in love, in pleasure in the world as it stands. There are the problems of class and faith to grapple with for Syms, and still he manages to find joy in living from beginning to end. I loved this book and would like to thank Roger McDonald for having created it."
4,Fit the bill,"I needed a step stool for my daughter to reach the sink to wash her hands but I didn't want anything that couldn't be broken down later that took up too much space. This was perfect. You do have to assemble it yourself but I did that in less than five minutes. It's sturdy and well made, I'm very happy with the purchase."
5,It is a great stool for higher beds.,We have a little higher bed and this two step stool works great! I have been VERY pleased with the KidKraft products we have!
3,not the best design to be used for children,the front is angled so that there is a large space between the top step and the cabinet in front- quality is good but a child could easily step in the space in front and get hurt.
2,Major Problem With Steps,"The steps itself are fine - strong and sturdy HOWEVER, the first time we used, we realized that the steps slide on floor away from sink. With the small child on the steps, the child will fall. Even when they are supervised, like we always do, sometimes we are so involved with teaching him to wash his hands, we don't even realize the child is sliding away from the sink.. I am very unhappy with this product. It needs some type of felt pattern to hold in place."
5,Great stool,"This is a great stool for our 2 year old son to be able to wash his hands and brush his teeth. We ordered in natural. It's a little darker than the online photo, and in my opinion is better than the photo. Ordering another one in white for upstairs! Easy assembly (for my husband). Quick delivery. Thanks."
1,Lemon!,"We just received nicely packaged but the assembly was impossible! Even tough materials are of good quality, one hole was drilled in a wrong position so the screw did not align. Filling out the return slip now, very disappointed."
3,Functional but very cheap wood,"My brother put this together for us and while putting it together the screw went right through the wood- we still use it, but it is incredibly cheap wood."
5,Love this step stool!,"This step stool is great, just what I was looking for. It was very easy to assemble. My four year old uses it to get onto her new big girl bed and it works great. I also bought some reusable butterfly stickers from Amazon to decorate the stool and she loves it."
2,Irritating Irritating Irritating,"I will revisit this product review when I finally receive the correct part to actually fully assemble it. The original order came with 2 identical side pieces, when the side pieces should have been mirror images (reverse) of each other. So, the half-assembled stool has been sitting in my garage waiting for the delivery of a replacement side piece, which I received today. I had done my best explaining what was wrong to the KidKraft rep on the phone, but I still ended up receiving an incorrect side piece, so the stool is STILL sitting in my garage, doing me absolutely NO GOOD FOR IT'S INTENDED PURPOSE. Seriously, I don't have time for this kind of ridiculousness. Get your product packing right, improve your quality control, and STOP WASTING MY TIME. Because of this I will never purchase another KidKraft item, I don't care if it's the greatest product on Earth."
1,good design - horrible quality,"the quality of this product is horrible - ""wooden"" steps break when you put this thing together. Wall Mart sells items, similar to this (also crappy quality) but much cheaper."
1,Dangerous,"The step stool doesn't line up flush against the cabinet. As my toddler leans forward over the sink the step stool moves right out from underneath him. I can't imagine why they would design a step stool this way. I would not recommend it for use on wood or linoleum floors without some other protection against sliding. At this price, you can do much better."
1,Ridiculous,"I'm shocked that a company like KidKraft that makes so many children's products would create something so silly. This step stool is just dangerous! The gap between the stool and whatever furniture you are placing it against is big enough to get a little foot caught. It is also a little steep and uncomfortable and the picture looks like you'd be able to lift the top step for storage, but it's just wasted space. I sent it back as soon as I put it together and tried it out. It's also very heavy, which I guess can be a safety feature to avoid toppling, but because of the gap it actually just made it more dangerous if it tipped over."
2,"Nicely crafted, but angled","This stool would be perfect if it weren't angled. If you have a sink with a cabinet, the stool will not be flush against the cabinet because of the angle. Small feet can slip right through."
2,Not the right color,"The two pictures of the natural wood stool are different step stools. One is a laminate wood and one is a natural wood with thicker pieces of material and inset screws. There is no way to know what you are going to get. The one I received is basically yellow laminated plywood type. I was wanting a step stool made of solid pieces of wood and stained a classic oak color. This product is not as pictured, it is correctly described in the text. If anyone goes to the Kidkraft.com web site and clicks on ""Buy Online"" the first item in the search list comes up on Amazon. Be warned the item pictured on KidKraft.com is not what Amazon is selling. The stool is not horrible, just not what I was expecting."
3,Skidding and potencially hazardous,"I bought this to be placed at the foot of my 3 1/2 year old daughter's new daybed to make it easier for her to get on and off the bed. It looks good and feels heavy and is made of solid wood. However, there are two drawbacks: 1. It skids on the hardwood floor of her room when she climbs onto her bed, which is hazadous. I need to find something to be put under it to prevent it from skidding away from the bed 2) Like another reviewer wrote, the back of the stool is not made straight to the floor and makes a gap between the bed and the stool, into which a little foot (we have a 1 1/2 yearl old too) could potentially slips."
2,Heavy and with a weird gap,"This stepping stool is VERY heavy. It also creates a weird gap between the front of the top step and whatever it is pushed against. Not a very good use of space. Also, not for use with a toilet because it puts the child too high to then sit down on the toilet. Perhaps best used to wash hands and things of that sort."
4,Handy step stool,"This is a great little step stool for my 5 year old daughter. She uses one in her bathroom so she can brush her teeth and the other in the kitchen and main bathroom to wash hands. It is a pretty simple assembly, but I had a challenge with the support bar. I wish it came in a broader range of colors."
5,Sturdy step stool,"We got this for our great-grandson, who loves to climb. It was exactly what we were looking for; it is sturdy, safe for his climbing and he can push it wherever he wants to climb and it doesn't turn over."
4,Great step stool,I looked for a step stool for my 2.5 year old daughter everywhere! I chose this one because it was taller than most (now she can just barely reach the faucet in the bathroom and she is tall for her age). It is incredibly sturdy and stable. The only thing that would make it better is if there were non-slide pads on the bottom. But she loves it and I trust it and it's the only one that I found that is tall enough to work for her.
4,Great but needs non-skid base,"This was the nicest, tallest step stool I found online that would be great for my toddler. Only problem is it does slip, so I am going to try to glue some rubber on the bottom to stop that."
4,I am pleased with this purchase,"I don't know why Amazon catagorized this itme as a ""toy"" and asked me to review it's educational value. But whatever, this step stool is very good, we like it. It's one of the taller ones that are available for sale on Amazon. Our bathroom sink is high so we needed something taller than usual, and this one did it. There is a gap between the top step and the counter wall, this is due to the fact that the back edge is slanted out. I suppose the slant provides more stability. I don't find it to be a hazard for my son's little feet. He is able to stand far enough back that the couple of inches in the front edge isn't a problem for him."
2,15 minutes packed into 90 minutes,"There isn't 90 minutes of footage!!! There is 15 minutes of total footage... maybe. They show a short clip of a move (most are far from innovative), then they show it again, then it's shown in super slow motion, then it's shown one last time. The whole time you're screaming to yourself, ""NEXT!""It's not an instrustional by any means. As a highlight video, it's content falls flat on it's face. If you want instructionals go for Marcelo Garcia, or Saulo. If you want highlights go for 101 Submissions. If you want to be disappointed, buy something of Marc Laimon's."
3,its ok but..,"i was hoping for an instructional ,it mostly showcases big name mma guys ,when a ton of no name guys are most skillfull . didn't like the obnoxious music used on these dvds i had to mute it out ,the music just adds to poor taste ."
5,Stimulating Inspiration,"This a truly great book about the integrity of various leaders. In a departure from the approach of most leadership literature, such as the corporate or political approach, Vaughan employs the biographical approach and studies the essence of leadership by examining the character traits of great leaders: Christopher Columbus, Patrick Henry, William Wilberforce, Robert E. Lee, Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Kuyper, G. K. Chesterton, C. S. Lewis and Winston Churuchill. The reader is inspired by the virtue of these great men. Pillars of Leadership is extensively documented, interesting and stimulating. This is a book for educators, statesmen, pastors and anyone else desiring to make a positive and lasting impact in the world."
5,greatest show ever!,wacky and packy is the coolest show ever and I think you should buy it and see it for yourself and if you have a DVD player then you could buy the casper toon DVD.
3,great beaded gifts,"When I first got this book I was feeling a little let down, I was expecting more of Lindas seed bead jewellery, but once I got to really study it, I found that this will be a book that I will use a lot. I like the projects, they are graded from easy to more advanced, and the hints and techniques at the back of the book is great."
4,Great gospel music,"Boris Kodjoe plays the part of David, a pastor's son who plans to follow in his father's footsteps. When tragedy strikes their family, David becomes disillusioned with his father and leaves home. He becomes a pop star and his career is advancing well when he receives a phone call telling him that his father is ill. He returns to his home town, only to discover that his old friend Frank is taking over the church and leading it to be a showcase for him rather than a house of worship. Several topics are touched on in the movie--the difficulties of being a ""preacher's kid"", pastors whose egos influence their decisions, and the ugliness of church politics. It's not the most polished movie around and it does not have the best script, but when the gospel numbers come on, they light up the screen and draw in the audience with their sheer exuberance. My advice is to to forget the flaws and just enjoy!"
2,"so/so movie,but there is a message","whle the film was underwritten&was lacking in places,it had a message of coming together.family&Friend relationships are very important&before you start judging you have to make sure that you yourself is together. this film does have a uplift feel&everything comes together at the end.it takes a loss to make everybody come together.i enjoyed the Music.props to Kirk Franklin,Fred Hammonds,Donnic Mcclurkin&Yolanda Adams amonget others who gave off there talent."
4,Enjoyable family movie,"I agree that this movie has some flaws and gaps in the story line (making some parts difficult to follow), but it is saved by the rich character cast and incredible music. I am glad that I purchased this movie."
2,Should Not Have Been Titled The Gospel,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this movie should not have been titled the gospel. I did not like the movie at all. If I weren't already a born-again Christian, there would be nothing in this movie that would lead me in that direction. It seemed like a lot of big-named gospel and secular singers were trying to get in the limelight in this movie. There was so much confusion that you couldn't tell where one scene ended and began. This movie could have been done much better. The only reason I didn't give a zero is because Donnie McClurkin's played his part well."
1,Boo,"Was looking for a soundtrack and was sent the movie instead. Package came completely wrapped and looked great, but I was expecting to hear some good jams without having to watch a whole movie"
3,"should have been titled ""the prodigal preachers son""","Your take on this movie will depend on why you are watching it. ""The Gospel"" will leave you disappointed if you actually want to hear the Gospel.If you want to see the problems with being raised a preachers kid, being disgusted with ""church business"", rejecting the faith for the world and then seeing the faith that was instilled as a youth come back to life-(a modern day prodigal son story)- you will enjoy the movie. Otherwise, the camera work and acting is barely balanced by the music."
3,Hooked Bags,"I particularly like the size of the book, as well as the clear, larger-print instructions."
2,Hooked Bags: 20 Easy Crochet Projects,Dissappointed in symplicity of patterns. Was hoping for something more challenging.
5,Buckskin Joe,I've been to the movie set at the Royal Gorge in Colorado many times. The set is an old ghost town removed from it's location to Colorado for making movies and tourist happy. To research the history of this town I found myself involved with the history of Buckskin Joe himeself. Buckskin Joe: A Memoir is written in a first hand accounting of Buckskin. His journeys through the untamed land is a very good read.He is a mixture of mountain man and pioneer.
4,Hilariously Harrowing Memoir,"I was drawn to this book because the author, Paul Feig, was the creator of the excellent and lamentablt short-lived TV series, Freaks and Geeks. And while reading it, one can certainly see the genesis of the show in his hilariously awkward childhood. Since Mr. Feig and I must be about the same age, this was a trip down memory lane, both in terms of the childhood experiences and the pop cultural references. This entertaining and neurotic memoir could probably be read in a single evening, but why rush it? I found myself delayed by frequent laughing jags followed by moments of reverie as I daydreamed of incidents from my own long ago youth. I found the stories from the junior high years to be absolutely hysterical while those from the high school years were a bit more ponderous. But overall, well done and great fun!"
5,Days of Yore in Gym and in Love,"Paul Feig is a gifted writer and director. As a fan of his work on Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, I was excited to read his memoir. His book is actually better than most of his TV work. There is a poignancy to the writing that really stands out (and could be found in some of his TV work too), but the book is always better than the movie anyway. The book is hilariously blunt. Most of us had one or two of these embarrassing events happen to us as children, but how many of us had 278 pages worth? You will indeed laugh so hard that you will cry and perhaps even want to cry. Feig is clearly one of the good guys. He remembers a time that was indeed simpler--but not one that has gone away. Every kid has his traumas reading about his make your own more endurable. I'm recommending this extraordinary book to everyone I know. If only more people had his honesty and insights, the young adult world would be a better place. Nevertheless, kids like Feig make super adults."
5,"We love you, Fig Newton!","I'm a HUGE fan of the cancelled (Why?!WHY!) series Freaks and Geeks, so of course when I learned the creator had written a series of stories about his own tortured adolescence, I had to have it. So many things that I loved about the tv series were present in Feig's memoirs. The gym class archipegalo rings particularly true for me. How well I remember the endless games of ""Killer"" (or ""Battleball"", as it was known in my school), the way even the most innocuous names could be twisted into something humiliating, the frightening ""freak girls"" who were worse than any male bully ever thought about being. From a former geek: It's obvious that he knows of which he speaks. And, as promised, he's gone on to do great things (please, please bring back Freaks and Geeks, please!), while his former tormentors probably lead dull and unimaginative lives.For anybody who's survived middle school and looked back to see the humor~"
5,Trials and tribulations of a geek,"Paul Feig has acquired a real legion of fans as a result of his television show ""Freaks and Geeks."" And justifiably so. ""Freaks and Geeks"" was one of the best shows in the last twenty years. Feig's book ""Kick Me"" is just as enjoyable. As others here have commented the book contains equal doses of cringing and laughter. For most of us adolescence was painful and Paul's was off the scale. But his sense of humour and writing talents make his tales of teenaged angst a pleasure to read."
5,Buy this if you were in junior high in the 1970's,"Book by the creator of freaks and Geeks.Very funny and grim, I dont know how he survived childhood.I laughed so hard that I cried.Remember your first time being naked in a locker room?Paul does and it's beautifully horrible."
5,"Paul ""Fag"" is hilarious.","I read this book last year after I stumbled across it in my school's library...and laughed the whole time I was reading. Just the first page, ""There is no god!"" and then proceeding to fill us all in on his crazy family, horrible life experiences, from single ply toilet paper to ""inspections"" in gym class. This is one of the funniest books you will ever read."
2,Big Loser,"I picked this book up because Amazon recommended it based on other books I liked. I was hoping for another Augusten Burroughs or David Sedaris. Instead, I found nothing interesting, unique, or even very funny about this book. The chapter on vomit did me in."
2,Count Me Out,"Sorry, but this geek is not jumping on the geekwagon. Despite being sub'ed Adventures in Adolescence, many of the anecdotes actually deal with the author's pre-adolescent years, coming of age-olescence if you will, and frankly they are the funnier entries. (But am I wrong to doubt that the author could really start having orgasmic experiences at age 7?) The biggest problem is that the germ obsession sets the author apart from the typical geek, who would have gladly braved a little [spoiler warning here] puke breath to make out with a cute girl, and way too many of the experiences described in the book deal with that phobia. There are 2-3 laugh out loud passages, 6-8 cleverly turned phrases, but they don't make up for the laborious redundancies - Bill, we get it about the rope, enough with the ""25 foot lover"" references, the repeated return to the mincing descriptions, etc."
3,A good primer for Freaks & Geeks fans,"A good read for hardcore Freaks & Geeks fans. Alot of insights behind the many stories and characters of that top notch series. Otherwise, the stories are sentimental, wistful pap. If you, too, have been drawn into the world of F&G, this book is essential, just get it cheap. Otherwise, other books have done better. Sorry Paul, but I still love ya."
3,excellent bedtime storybook,When I was a little girl my Daddy would read me an Uncle Wiggly story every night. The best thing about this storybook is that each chapter ends with a cliffhanger-type sentence and picks up in the next chapter where it left off. It was wonderful! I just couldn't wait to get to the next chapter tomorrow night and I think this anticipation encouraged future reading. Because of the age of the stories the word usage is kind of antiquidated so I rate it with a three star rating.
5,Better than Expected!,"I received the CDs on time and was kind of skeptical on what I would receive. After doing some research, it feels like I got these CDs and cases at a bargain!"
1,Not working in Car,"After recording CD using Windows 7 media play based on the article eHow, the recorded CD can play on the computer. However, it is not able to play in the Honda Civic original car stereo. A big waste of time of shopping, recording, and etc since my goal is to play audio lessons during my commute. Called Sony recording media customer service and was told that I have to pay for return shipping to get repaired. I am sure it is the way the media was made, and cannot exchange to CDR or something. The customer service told me that they did not care if the recorded CD play on car stereo or not. Buyers for car stereo should stay away. Customer service is bad and cannot provide a reasonable solution."
5,great,My dad ( a die hard plane fanatic) hardly put it down on his visit to us (his B-day fell over his visit). It's always so nice to pick the perfect gift.
4,Great Conversation Piece,"This book is a great way to pass the time and a must for any aviation nut. Obviously it can't go into great depth on every power flying vehicle ever produced, but it does an outstanding job of hitting all the high points."
5,First class,"More of a fascination perhaps than an interest, at least not in terms of the mechanics which is beyond me, I have always be drawn to planes ever since I was a kid. I like this book on several reasons. The reader does not have to be educated in aviation to read and enjoy it. There is a lot to get from it. The pictures are just outstanding. Pictures of planes because of their size can sometimes lose value. Not with this book. I can say the book is worth it based on pictures alone, and it has value (which I think all good books do) because it is worth being passed on to other readers. I hope this is not taken the wrong way because it is geared mostly to guys but even some females I think would like it because of the author's approach of the topic. Even if I was not fascinated by planes I would still like this book.I have a couple of friends who are pilots and they are impressed with it."
5,Bought as Christmas gift for my son,This is one of the two books I surprised my son with on Christmas 2012. He loves it. We recently have been to Washington to visit a grandson and spent quite a time in the aircraft museums. This covers flight as a great addition to these tours.
2,A piece of history,"A word of warning. These are early recordings of the original Taste and Richard McCracken and John Wilson do not appear despite what it says on the back cover. Rory's guitar virtuosity is missing too as he fills the spaces with chords and lots of harmonica playing. Never considered good enough for release, these recordings came out long after Taste and Rory had made names for themselves. However, I love it for its rough edges and simplicity and it makes an interesting companion piece to the first official Taste album. The progression in Gallagher's guitar playing is remarkable. One to buy once you've swept up the rest of the Gallagher catalogue. No excuse for the shoddy and inaccurate packaging though."
2,Save Your Dollars: Don't Buy Easy Dollars,"There is no way to ensure that you will win ""easy money"". The lottery is completely based upon luck. Calculating probabilities does not even necessarily increase your chances of winning since the lottery cannot be predicted.Of course, you chances in Pick 3 and Pick 4 games are certainly better than the bigger games, but the only way to ensure that you win is to buy a ticket with every number on it.This book is misleading and not informative. There is much more helpful information on the internet for free. Simply type in ""how to win pick 3,"" ""how to win pick 4,"" ""lottery strategies"", etc. in a search engine and you're bound to find tons of helpful information. If you don't know where to search, you can also check out [...] for lottery tips and strategies for free."
3,stop losing and start winning,"This book was confusing for me, more then likely my own lack of comprehenson. i have read other wheeling methods which were a lot more clear."
2,Really contradicts itself.,From the preface:This book is not about wheeling systems.Chapter Three(Chapter title):Pick 3 Wheeling.That should tell you something.
2,Gerri's Review,"After reading the above book, it was a bit complicated for me understanding how to create numbers combinations and wheeling since I don't play the lotto. I feel this book is better suited for experienced lotto players and not someone who is just beginning."
2,DOESNT SAY ANYTHING REASONABLE,"I purchased this book thinking it had reasonable information like some previous lottery books i had read but unfortunately i was TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.All the information this book carries is right in every state lottery website,nothing absolutely nothing is special about this book. When it arrived i read the entire book once and THAT WAS IT, i never even took the book again.Buyers should beware !!!!!"
3,Nice Vest,"This vest in nice, but for a petite woman is was way too large.If they made one in an XS that fit me I would have exchanged itfor that size. I had to return it."
1,do not recommend this printer,"I purchased this printer 18 months ago. I use it mostly for draft, inhouse, prints. Occasionally for photo quality prints, but not much. After about 6 months, I started having to clean the head. <fast forward to today and many ink cartridges later>. Last week (april 07), I had to do another print head cleaning. I ended up replacing ALL the ink cartridges and getting only 2 head cleans completed. When I said it needed ANOTHER cyan cartridge, after already replacing EVERY cartridge in it that morning, I wanted to throw it over the hill! That is $132 worth of cartridges, 1.5 hours later and still the head was not cleaned.Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another Epson, nor recommend any Epson to anyone.I replaced it with an HP1020, non color printer for my inhouse papers. It was only $99 at Staples. Less than the darn ink I stuck in the Epson.I've used HP, Xerox and many other brands of printers....."
2,Awful printer,"The Epson R1800 has been nothing but trouble for me. I'm in the printing business and wanted to use this for proofs but have never been able to get this printer to print colors correctly. We have tried every setting and every type of paper, but the colors always come out wrong. The software is terrible. It is very un-intuitive.I think I'll stay with HP printers from now on."
1,I WILL NEVER BUY EPSON AGAIN.,"I don't care paying for the ink which already caused a lawsuit against epson, but if I have a document to print in black and I need it only to be reproduced in black and white, why in the world would not allow to print it if I have a brand new black in cartridge if the cyan is empty. You have to have ALL cartridges full in order to print black only. Nice to know their phliosophy but I don't think will earn them more customers."
1,LEMON,"-5 out of 5 stars Bad printer - don't waste your money -LEMON!!!!! I bought this printer because of all the rave reviews. I have had it a year and have not have even one good print. The ink is very expensive. The printer eats cartridges. When the color only printed out blue I tried to clean the cartridges, and while cleaning the cartridges I went through 4X of each of the 7 colors. It cost a fortune! I kept thinking it was a fluke, maybe the ink was all dried up. But even buying cartridges from different stores didn't help. My computer said it was out of ink each time a new cartridge was inserted. I ended up spending more on ink than the computer cost. Throwing it out the window would be a delight except that would be more effort than this printer is worth."
4,"very good,","everything as expected. great color, the only thing that I found difficult was using paper from the manual hadler and the roll of paper does not allow a 24 inches roll, maximun is smaller."
1,"I HATE this printer, it has sucked the lifeblood out of me!","I have had this printer for many years and have fought with it every single time I try to use it. I've probably spent more than 40 hours with tech support over the years. Very simple things like getting a black and white print to have no essence of tint are impossible. Also, even after using Color Monkey and setting the correct color, still it doesn't come out the way I want. Constantly fighting with the paper feed for top end single sheets is the norm. Never once have I turned it on and just used it. In the past years I have switched from a PC to a MAC and am now using Lightroom. I decided to try once more my R1800 - and since I have so much $$ invested in ink I have yet to purchase something else. Forget it, more hours of total frustration. I am going to feel very good busting this piece of $#%* up and recycling it. I've reached the end of my rope. NEVER AGAIN will I buy anything from EPSON!"
1,"Cleaning the heads is part of printing, almost everytime.","This is a serious ink hog, which seriously sucks, but the worst aspect of this printer is that it must be cleaned constantly, and I mean all the time, which uses up a tremendous amount of ink. Just plan on cleaning as a regular part of your printing routine. I'm not kidding."
1,Not Mac Friendly,"I bought this printer thinking that it was going to be as great as my past epson printers. Boy was I wrong! Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with this printer. So far, I've only been able to print basic documents, but nothing fancy. It turns out that the driver doesn't support Intel Based Macs. So although it can print real simple documents, I can't choose the print quality when I need to print higher resolution pictures, so all my art prints are coming out horrible. I went online and downloaded the driver for the Intel based Mac and I followed the directions that Epson posted, but I still can't choose the print settings. I've had it for a couple of weeks and I'm about ready to throw it out the window! It's very frustrating and it has set me back with work because I can't print and sell my art prints. I'm sure if the driver worked, it would be a great printer, but so far I could've bought a $90 cheap printer and have gotten better prints."
3,Very good...very frustrating,"High quality color prints, but my R1800 is extremely frustrating to use when printing several-page documents...in my case a photo calendar PDF.After printing one page, the printer regularly ""shoot's"" through a blank page and stops. Occasionally it will print 2 pages (rarely more than 2) and then ""shoot and stop"".Reports to Epson web_support leads to no response.Also, rather that the expensive Epson inks, those from LD products (at almost 1/3rd the price) have worked just fine for over the past year. A problem with a couple of cartridges have led to free replacements from LD."
1,Frustrated and Poor,"I have been sitting here all day long printing nozzle checks, replacing one ink cartridge after another, running the cleaning cycle, and then printing another atrocious nozzle check. I have moved the print head off the cap and cleaned it (which has worked for the last year, but not today). I have not printed a single photo without horizontal lines and I am at the end of my rope and the end of my willingness to spend mega $$$ on ink cartridges. Too bad the gallery won't be getting any of my photos tomorrow or in the near future.I gave this printer one star because it printed beautifully for about one year."
4,Amazing printer,"I purchased this printer knowing it would be a great printer for small/medium sized prints, and it absolutely is! The Gloss optimizer really kicks ass. The large format Epson printers don't compare to the quality the R1800 puts out, and I should know because I also use an Epson 10000 on a regular basis.The other reason worth buying the R1800 is that you will astound clients with stunning CD/DVD printing. I've printed on a variety of inkjet writable discs and every time the results blow me away!!The downside is the small ink cartridges disappear quickly and the banner paper loading is kind of hit or miss, it should have a micro adjust knob or something or a visual aid lining up the paper at the head-stops.But whatever, I'm very satisfied with my purchase..."
1,rip off,"if you are going to print a few large pictures every now and then and that is it, then maybe this printer is for you. but if you are a normal person who likes to print off several photos as well as e-mails, internet documents and other normal stuff, then this printer is a nightmare. it is constantly constantly constantly running out of one of its eight color cartridges and then it won't even let you print in black! it is expensive to keep all of that ink around! then half the time it prints your picture poorly, so you have to print it again and, well, there goes your ink. i am so angry i purchased this thing. it is huge and incompetent. i hate it. i recommend you get a normal small reliable printer and then send away for your prints."
2,Finicky and Expensive,"This product has been really disappointing. We have had it for over a year, and at the beginning it was great. Photos looked really nice, colors were bright, etc. But after just a few photos, it started to print really streaky pictures...so you run the auto headcleaning utility and waste a quarter of the ink just to clean the printheads. Then it works for a few more pictures and becomes streaky again. Additionally, if you are just printing something that isn't a photo, only the expensive paper will load. It gives an error message for any other thin stock paper. So basically, if you spend a lot of money on paper and ink, you will get nice photos some of the time, but you will end up wasting half of the expensive ink cleaning the printheads. I would not recommend that anyone buy this printer."
2,Disappointing,"This printer worked intermittently after I first got it, now doesn't work at all. It's out of warranty & I haven't tried getting it fixed."
1,DO NOT BUY! TERRIBLE PRINTER!,"I work in graphic design and have used Epson products for over 15 years now. My experience has been consistent problems... I currently own the R1800. Everytime I go to print something out there is an issue. EVERY time!!! The paper doesn't feed, or the paper runs through but doesn't print. The ink cartridges clog and don't work. etc. etc. etc. There is always some issue with it and I wind up getting frustrated and printing it on another printer. It's a shame, I spent a lot of money on this and when it does print properly the prints are beautiful. I just can't handle the frustration of investing an hour of my time for every page I want to print. My next one will be a Canon!"
3,"Easy banner printing, print quality is OK CD printing a pain","I've had this printer for over a year. My complaints are the same ones you'll find anywhere on the net: Prints, even HQ, often show banding and fine lines. Cleaning the printer drains ink disproportionately fast - six cleanings can suck up $125 in ink! Banner printing, even borderless, is easy.CD and DVD printing is a nightmare - the provided software is impossible to use - the CD/DVD's are consistently 1"" to 1/2"" off! I had to create custom templates is Photoshop and Corel Draw in order to print on these. After doing so, the quality was great - and I was able to print on narrow spindle CD's and DVD's (not possible with the included software.)Overall, it's a ""you get what you pay for"" printer."
3,Epson Cash Cow!,"I had to replace my Epson 1270, which they decided not to supply new drivers for my operating system.The shocker comes when you buy all 8, yes, 8 cartidges at a whopping $115.00.Each cartridge runs about 12.99 a piece, one of the colors costs about ten dollars more.You can replace just one color but I have found that if you are printing color you soon need to replace the other colors too. The other problem is that if they are like the 1270, they tend to dry out when not used in a week and you have to use the Epson Printer Utility to get them going again. This uses a HUGE amount of your precious ink.I loved the 1270. I am a professional designer and illustrator and require accurate colors which the 1270 did very well. I will write more when I get a chance to run this one through its paces. Since I don't need to print color at this moment I am afraid to open the ink cartidges!I just wish I would have been aware of the costs ahead of time."
5,Quite Happy,"Although I haven't tried 13 x 19 prints yet (the paper hasn't arrived), my brand new R1800 has printed everything I've thrown at it with an almost perfect match to my color-balanced monitors. The drivers are intuitive in OS X, and I'm getting better prints directly from Photoshop than I ever have. I've included 4 x 6 prints in batches of print house photos, and nobody has been able to tell the difference. (Although I think mine are a bit better, since I can control the output to my liking.) My 8 x 10 matte prints are simply amazing, and I'm not-so-patiently awaiting the arrival of my 13 x 19 luster paper.This is a good choice for an avid enthusiast like myself."
3,R1800 - Great for Matte - Poor for Glossy,"I own an R1800. The matte prints are outstanding and the printer is quick, but the glossy prints are not up to par with dye based printers. Even with the glossy overcoat the images look cloudy. This would be fine but Epson sells this as an outstanding glossy printer.If you need a matte printer, this printer offers top quality right out of the box. Be careful using the Epson Watercolor paper because it is too thin and doesn't aborb the ink well. I use non-Epson papers that are much thicker and the R1800 delivers outstanding results."
4,R1800 Epson printer,"I'm quite pleased thus far with this unit; the quality of color and relative speedare just what I wanted. I'll have to wait and see how ink consumption is, andI need to order more paper from Epson; whose paper is not widely available inoffice supply stores."
2,Extremely aggravating waste of ink and stupid software!,"I agree with those who have posted here about the incomprehensible ink waste one encounters using this printer. Unless you are independently wealthy this thing will suck the life blood out of you. It goes through ink like a drunken sailor goes through cheap rum.And why in the heck does it stop dead in its tracks when it runs out of glossy optimizer and all I want to do is print a black and white copy of a list? This is just plain incompetence on the part of Epson.Admittedly, it does do a beautiful job of printing when it isn't making you want to take a sledge hammer to it. I doubt I'd ever buy another Epson after this one gives up the ghost. In fact, I may just sell the danged thing so that I can get my blood pressure back to normal."
4,r1800 photo printer,"recently upgraded to the R1800 from a previous Epson photo printer. I was amazed at how large the printer is, it was bit shocking even tho I read the measurements! As for the print quality, it is amazing! I have not tried the other models above this one so I can not compare it to any more expensive Epson printers, yet it is a better printer than the photo 820. If you don't need the large format printing, then I would suggest the R800. I am new to digital photography and photo printing so I speak from an amateur's point of view and my opinion is that this is more printer than I need! I just need to catch up to all its abilities!"
3,"The quality is great, but I'm not sure it was worth the investment.","In order to keep the inks from drying up, you need to use this printer at least once a week. I've had to perform all types of maintenance on the printer to keep it going, and sometimes I think that, despite the excellent quality of the prints, it might be worth the hassle, the timesuckage, and the per page expense of using the printer at school rather than having it conveniently at home, all to myself, (theoretically) at a less expensive price."
5,Piece of Cake,"Super easy to set up, even for an intermediate user like myself. Setup took 15 minutes, including setting up profiles for the paper. Very fine smooth tones, perfectly saturated but not overly so."
4,SUPER!,A super printer which works well for printing promotional pieces and portfolio pages. I would recommend this printer for the serious amatuer photographer.
1,very upset,"I got his printer in Feb of 2006 b/c I wanted a large format printer...now in 2008 it will no longer print. And y? Well out of media, paper not loaded correctly. I have read the reviews and tried everything..but still not working. Two of my friends have this printer and one of them works fine..the other one same problem. Its very tempermental! I had a epson printer in 2002 and it did the same thing..after a year...then they sent me 2 more referbished ones still same problem. My sister has the epson C86 its aweful! it eats INK,,and the black ink cost 30 dollars! It makes lines through the prints and the text printing is terrible! I don't know what to do or what printer to buy. Then i called espon and they said they never heard of the ""out of media, paper not loaded correctly problem"" liars..all they have to do is check message boards like these."
1,DON'T BUY . . . if you don't print every day,"It prints great. I have gotten very nice pictures and scrpabook pages -- 6 pages to be exact. The problem is that if you don't use it on a daily basis, you need to clean the print heads every time you want to use it. This wastes tons of ink. I have printed exactly 6 12 * 12 scrapbook pages before all my ink run out. This is an expensive proposition when you take into account the cost of the cartridges."
1,Can't afford to print,"I bought this printer a few years ago and loved the quality of the prints. It worked wonderfully for the first few months, and I couldn't be happier with this. The honeymoon period ended pretty soon when the ink started running out at an atrocious rate. By the time I calibrated the printer or cleaned the nozzles (which get clogged often if you don't use it all the time), I only get a few prints before I need to change one of the eight cartridges. At 13 dollars per cartridge, I couldn't afford to maintain this Ferarri of printers. The Epson still works perfectly but I can't afford to swap in new cartridges almost every time I print. Despite the quality of the prints, I am giving the Epson R1800 one star. I wish Epson made more clear how thirsty and high maintenance the R1800 is."
4,works great,i actually bough this allot cheaper than it is in the market i only had to pay a bit extra on its price for the installationreally great
4,Beware! this book may make you fall off you chair laughing.,"Lady slings the Booze is full of one-liners and puns! So if you can't take it, stop reading. Lady Sally aka wife of Mike Callahan stars in this one - and she is out to save the world. With the help of some very talented 'artists' in her employ she goes about it. The book twists and turns and there is no guessing the end. I was surprised it ended so abruptly. I've read many of Spider Robinson books both in and out of the 'Callahan' series and I love them. It doesn't matter where you start. I frequently had to stop reading and put the book down just to laugh at the the author's thought processes(and pun-usage). Highly recommended."
2,Didn't finish,"Gave up at around 150 pages. I received a copy of Christopher Moore's ""Island of the Sequined Love Nun"" that I ordered from Amazon. ""Scipio"" was at best interesting, and usually boring, so I had no hesitation to put it down to pick up the Moore book. Keep in mind, however, that Christopher Moore is a favorite of mine, and I just knew his book would fun, and ""Scipio"" just wasn't holding my interest."
1,Boring beyond boring,"Perhaps if Pears had attempted to write a novel with characters and ideas to hold the reader's interest instead of attempting a graduate thesis, this might be something one would wish to read. As it stands, it is a major disappointment, intellectually pretentious, and signifies nothing. It is also about time we stop trying to compare these also-rans with Umberto Ecco's Name of the Rose which still towers over all newcomers."
2,Not Worth Your Time,"I really enjoyed his first work An Instance of the Fingerpost. I gave up on this one after 60 pages or so. It is lacking that hard to define quality that keeps you reading a book. Some call it plot. I dont think it lacks a plot necessarily but really nothing happens to hold your interest, at least not in the first quarter of the book. I didnt feel the writing was strong enough for me to continue and find out what happens to these three men. The author attempts to write something epic and grand and also literary and I think it comes up short."
2,A Disappointment,"I found nothing gripping about this story, unlike author's previous work. Others indicate that there is a reward here, and there may be, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to find it."
1,Just couldn't do it....,"I've read Fingerpost, and all the Art History Mystery books, and loved them all, but I just could not get into this one. Other reviewers have said it is worth fighting through, but I just don't have the time or the inclination! This one didn't grab me. Stick to his series."
5,the best novel I've read this year,I cannot remember when a book has stayed with me for weeks after I read it and I continue to be overwhelmed with Mr. Pears craft in writing. I found the book to be so enthralling that I ordered an earlier title of his. The book requires attention but most anything that's worth having or doing does. I use this word with care: superb!
4,Layers of History,"The Dream of Scipio visits France during three separate time periods, the fall of Rome 450AD, the black plague in 1348 and the Nazi occupation 1940. The three periods of upheaval test the motives and morals of the people there. The message I came away with is the measure of a life is not in what you think or say, but what you do. The reading was somewhat complex at times but the observation of the three layers of history creates a fascinating effect that is well worth the effort."
4,even better the second time around,"I'm having a Pears moment. Having re-read Fingerpost, and not being as overwhelmed as I was first time around, I then re-read Scipio - and loved it more than the first time! It is both better written and plotted than Fingerpost (no mean feat) and a delight to read on many levels. The fact that I was about to visit a friend in Vaison also helped, I guess. I'm now reading another of his Argyll novels - light and fun but so different in style - amazing to think all 3 books were written by the same author. I have for some years been waitin on his next ""adult"" (if I may) novel - but, sadly, he seems to have been silent for some years now."
5,great,"complicated intertwining plotline, historical facts, philosophical ruminations, interesting characters...this book has it all. def a book to be chewed and enjoyed for long."
2,It's just so different from his other books,"I've read Iain Pears' art history mysteries and thought Dream would be similar, with perhaps a dash of Da Vinci Code thrown in. I just couldn't get into the book, but then I'm not the intellectual type who enjoys philosophy. It's likely that if you admire Jonathan & Flavia you won't like this one."
2,Brutal and Depressing,"Reading the first few pages of this book was enough for me. Page five offers, ""Thus bagan the tale of the doomed love between he poet and a young girl that was to lead to such a calamitous and cruel ending.""Life is calamitous and cruel enough without needing to tell these tales in the cold and precise way of Iain Pears. I read on because I was given the book as a gift and felt I might need to discuss it with my friend. I found the same shallowness (little character developement), interest in cruelty and lack of humanity throughout.I can certainly understand that there are plenty of people that go for this kind of writing. I am writing this review so that it may save a few kinder minds the trouble of buying it."
1,You must be joking.,Sophomoric meandering drivel covered with a patina of tinny allusions drawn from a very shallow reading of history.
4,"Insightful, thought-provoking","I know, I know, when you say ""insightful and thought-provoking"" it sounds like telling your friend his blind date is ""a great dancer and has a wonderful personality."" In other words, a schnauzer. But for someone willing to put thought and energy into thinking about what he or she is reading, and who appreciates the extraordinary skill and forethought required to produce this, it's a real find you won't put down, I find I enjoyed this slightly less than ""Instance of the Fingerpost,"" which is why it only got four stars instead of five, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless. I was at the store the day it went on sale, bought it in hardback and glad I did. Don't take it to the beach; save it for a long read in a comfortable chair and a healthy pitcher of your favorite beverage nearby."
2,If you can just get through the first 100 pages...,"... then you'll probably get through the whole book. But it is tedious, pedantic, and utterly lacking in engagement. By the time the book ended, I had finally become interested in two of the three main characters, but really wish I just hadn't read it at all. The best thing about it is the beautiful cover!"
1,A bitter disappointment--,"After loving The Fingerpost, I raced to get Pears' The Dream of Scipio, hopinghopinghoping to have a comparable experience. I tried hard; I tried it twice, a month or so apart. But I could not lose the sense of pushing a peanut around with my nose without ever being allowed to eat it. The characters are flat; we're never sure why we're being asked to pay attention to them; the writing lurches and stutters and embarrasses itself, as in ""It was a moment, he realized later, that summed up his whole existence in a tiny moment, like the world reflected in a tiny bead of water as it falls to earth"" (64). Whaaaa--? Is Mr. Pears' editor asleep at the wheel? I gave up."
2,Disappointment after the last book,"After *An Instance of the Fingerpost,"" this was a huge letdown. I couldn't make myself finish it. After the organic flow of the structure of the former, the forced architecture of *Dream* intruded into the narrativ and became an unwanted extra character."
1,Emergency Boredom Control,"After devouring some previous works by Iain Pears I leapt into The Dream of Scipio.Oops , this convoluted and dreary book stopped me in my tracks. I persisted in reading it through autumn then when winter came looked longingly at the burning fire for inspiration to continue reading. Boredom, fatigue and ennui overtook me and this book has been saved should I ever be marooned on a desert island. If I read two pages a day then i can also use the paper for personal hygiene purposes.What was the author thinking ?"
2,The plot is going nowhere,"I admire history and philosophy. I have an excellent knowledge of the Roman history, and love the times of Medieval Europe, but the book has disappointed me so dearly, that I was thinking to leave it on the shelf unread. I am struggling with reading despite reachness of language (1 star) and interesting characters (2nd star). But the way the plot (what plot?) is constructed, and the story is followed, the book is uninteresting and one stops caring about heros and heroines, and looks for something else to be hooked on. I could not find so far anything exciting, and maybe this novel should not be treated as a beach reading, I thought, I would have been smitten at least by historical landscape and philosophical mystery. I dare to say, you won't find any of that stuff."
4,sliding panels into the past,"I picked this book up at Borders, thinking it would make great poolside reading during my son's swimming lesson. Was I ever wrong! I found myself drawn into the plot immediately. But my brain got tired before too long and I had to put it down.There are so many stories going on at once that sometimes it's hard to keep track of them all. And I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending. Still, I really appreciate the obvious talent that went into the writing, and it made me think more than I had in a long time."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I see that I am not the first to say what I am going to say but I wish I had not paid so much attention to the early reviewers. I don't know what book they were reading but it could not have been The Dream of Scipio. This book is a big boor. I made it to page 111 before I concluded that it never was going to get better. How could anyone have thought that this book: without clear direction (except perhaps for Classics scholars), with uninteresting pseudo intellectual characters saying pithy things,and with three stories vying with themselves for the must tedious was worthy of more than one or two stars? Not me."
5,The scope is amazing!,"This is my first Iian Pears novel. I am amazed. Amazed at the scope, at the ease with which Pears weaves through the centuries and lets us share in this archeological experience in Southern France as if indeed we were putting the pieces together of these several layers of human occupation of a site. I have enjoyed it so much, I am going back and starting it again. Also, his characters are very believable and at times, so closely modelled on known historical lives that this reader, an art historian by training, wished the characters and the works mentioned existed outside of the printed pages. I am glad I read it, and will reread immediately."
5,Enlightening,"In this novel, which is based on truth, the author ever so brilliantly weaves a fascinating story while, ever so delicately, educates the reader between the lines. The second time I read it, I took notes."
3,Do not expect a new Fingerpost - but be ready to be challenged,"This is a 3.5 stars really, once I got into this book (like other reviewers I did finally only after having read the first 150 pages), I really started to appreciate the questions posed. One has to come to the answers oneself. A few are pretty clear - civilization is what we the people make of it together, and christianity is flawed. If you come to this for historical mystery like theAn Instance of the Fingerpost: A Novel, stay away. If you want to be challenged in thought, and read about three rather interesting characters, then this is a book which grows on you. Perhaps 4 stars after the second reading."
1,Simplistic interpretation driven by political agenda,"Burke's interpretation of military institutions is driven by her idea of how today's military needs to change. Rather than delving deeply into gender, folklore, and military culture as the title proclaims and which she is presumably trained to do as an English professor, she shallowly and aimlessly grazes over a handful of topics. If you are interested in the subject read Cynthia Enloe. At least she adds some complexity to her arguments."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"I must first apologize to anyone who has purchased this book in the past three months. If I had written this upon finishing Burke's diatribe perhaps I could have saved you some of your hard-earned money.My time is limited, so I will simply say that Ms. Burke distorts reality beyond recognition; portraying the marginal as the typical. Her research was either shoddy, or more likely, she discarded any findings that didn't conform to her agenda.This is probably the first book I've ever read that I can truly say is not worth the paper upon which it is printed."
1,Rubbermaid 54 qt. ice chest,False advertising! This ice chest does not have the dimensions advertised for the 54 qt. ice chest (25.3L x 17W x 15H). It measures only 20L x 13W x 13H. It's also red and not orange.
3,Cool... but Collapsing,"This is a really neat toy. The design of the batwing is great, and the instructions are fine, but the construction of the pieces leaves something to be desired. The pieces aren't as easy to fit together as Lego products, and they tend to pop apart pretty easily too.The escape pod is very cool though, as is the batman figure. If you (or your kids) can tolerate a certain amount of frustration over the construction of this toy, you will enjoy it."
5,Sims 2 pets,Bought for my oldest daughter. She LOVES the game. I have played with her. The way the characters sound when they talk is kinda wierd and funny. Makes us laugh. My daughter loves almost all the sims games.
4,My daughter loves it.,Thank you. My daughter loves the sims and this add on gives her more hours of game play. Although I kinda wish kids nowadays would go outside!
4,sims 2 pets,its awesome and its cool how you can design your own animalsyou cant woohoo in it though which is stupidbetter graphics than sims 2easier to make houses and stuffnot for people that dont like the sims games
3,Jank.,"It was super fun at first, but then the dogs started digging holes in my yard. And this stupid stray keeps coming into my house, even after I put the no strays sign up.It was cool, though. Because I created the Jonas Brothers, and made Joe and Kevin get married. I kicked Nick out, though. Because he was ugly. I created all their dogs, and Nick's was the stray. That thing is so annoying. He just keeps passing out, and getting revived. I also created Miley Cyrus, and Demi Lovato. And had them get Married. Also, there's Nick Jonas' girlfriend, Delta. And I hate, too. I made myself, too. And my cousin. Also, our dogs. And a stupid fat cat.Anyways, the game is pretty jank after a while."
2,Fun and frustrating,"I bought this game instead of this PC expansion pack because after I installed the Sims 2 on my computer I had no more memory left on my computer. The PC one looks a lot better though. This game freezes a lot and the Create A Family thing is a joke, you can't have kids, you can't choose your pet's age, you can't choose your sim's age, you can't give your pets away as gifts, there is no adoption pool, your puppies or kittens just sit in a basket for there entire puppyhood or kittenhood, there is no way you can put in the cheat to control your pets, should I go on?"
4,We already had this but service was great I just need to know how to exchnage it,How do I exchange this product I bought my daughter the wrong one. I am not very good at remembering the ones she has. Thanks for your help I think i kept the receipt. Jena Hill
3,what'sgoind on,"What how the dogs ""woohoo"" the sims can't didn't they read the review about the sims2 we want kids and be able to 'woohoo' gosh"
1,Not Intended For Children,"I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and found it totally inappropriate. The ""game"" had an instance of a man urinating in a toilet. Come on! Although there were no explicit graphics, what on earth does this have to do with a pets themed game? My daughter also informed me that she saw a character taking a shower. Again, there were no explicit graphics but what is the point of having this in a game?"
3,Love The Sims series......but where is the punch line?,"I enjoy all of The Sims games because i love the idea of building homes and purchasing items and completing goals....and i love animals as well so i figured this would be an awesome game. I was very excited at first when i created my pets and was able to have babies....and the things the animals do are so cute, even when they eat the garbage...but i also like the satisfaction of feeling like I am advancing in a game. I do enjoy the actual playing part but i play to win and i don't see where this game is going. It's fun to have pets and play in the Sim world with them but if you like playing games to see what new or exciting things will happen next this game will eventually make you want to put in on the shelf. Sorry to say it because i have every Sims game for Ps2 but this one was slightly disappointing."
5,"The novel Native Son is a ""MUST READ""..","The suspensful novel Native Son is riviting and exciting, it leaves you on the tip of your seat, always eondering what will happen next?...The author helps the reader live what the main charachter Bigger Thomas is going through, the betrayal, anxiety and the deciet..A MUST READ"
1,"Children's Chewable Vitamin flavor, with bitter Taurine aftertaste.","The ""orange"" you taste will be the powdery fake orange flavor most commonly associated with children's chewable aspirin. Take that flavor and mix it up with the bitter, unpleasant taste that all energy drinks seem to have -- which may be taurine, for all I know. The bottom line is that this drink tastes bad. I'm telling you now. It tastes bad. But, I am happy to report that the LIME version of this beverage is actually very good!"
5,Love it. I'm about to order some more.,"Be aware, these aren't 12 ounce normal soda cans, they're 8.4 ounce cans. Once you get past that, it's great. I'm about to order another case."
3,Different...,"Doomsday Deck is a good book. The Tarot is intelligent and the author seems to know alot about this subject. However, I rejected this book a 4 or 5-star rating because it doesn't explain clearly enough about Justine's paintings, the characters just aren't the same and the subject of Tarot doesn't really match slaying vampires excellently. I like stories about witchcraft and psychic people, and although this book's psychic story is interesting, the idea of people who touch Justine's Tarot cards and then become one of her paintings is totally laughable. It's hard to see Buffy taking this idea seriously in the TV show. There is a descriptive, intriguing and overall cracking conclusion that almost forgives all the film's faultS but when you look back, you remember the times when you sighed at the silliness. This is definitely a different idea, but I don't think it matches well with in the Buffy saga. Maybe as a book on it's own, Doomsday Deck would've been worthy of a higher rating."
1,Total fluff - skip it,"I had three problems with this particular entry to the Buffyverse:1. It's short. 193 pages in large print, so you really aren't getting your money's worth. It's a novella at best.2. The author doesn't capture the voice of the characters nearly as well as some of the other contributors, and some items are just wrong (e.g., especially in this Season 3 chronology, Buffy doesn't drive.) The dialogue is lame, with Buffy occasionally sounding like Giles, Anya never sounding like Anya, and a villian that doesn't even acheive the insightful repartee of your cheesy comic book. Try Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder for far superior characterizations and voices that ""get"" the Buffy tone.3. The story, which had potential in theory, is just plain lame in execution. The characters do stupid things, the conclusion is artificial, and you are left with the thought that these people are no better than the various teenagers offed in any B grade horror flick. Don't waste your money."
3,Kali Vs. Buffy - Slayer Decked!,"Gallagher's least-developed Buffy book, but not bad. It shoots out of a gun and rips right through, but everything seems to happen out of the blue without any kind of buildup. It's as light as popcorn and just as satisfying, but hey, sometimes you're in the mood for popcorn.You can't completely dislike a book with a villainess so venal, she'd sell her soul and risk the destruction of the universe just for her own New York art show. The would-be artist in question is in league with the goddess Kali, utilizing a cursed tarot deck to hasten the apocalypse. Kali! Buffy! One round only! Winner take all!Yeah, kinda fun, if you're in the mood. You've read better, but you could kill an hour or two out of your life in worse ways."
4,Good Pentecostal Study Bible,"I read the reviews of the Full Life Study Bible and felt I had to respond, especially to the woman from Georgia's view that this study Bible is filled with ""hate.""This study Bible reflects the work of a Pentecostal missionary, the late Donald Stamps. Various other Pentecostal scholars also worked on the study Bible including prestigious scholars such as Dr. Stanley Horton, Dr. French Arrington, and Dr. Robert Shank.My only complaints against the Full Life is that the notes were written by one man so they are not as plentiful as say the NIV Study Bible. I also would favor a more literal translation such as the NASB or the NKJV then the NIV although I am not opposed to the NIV. The study notes reflect the theology of the classical Pentecostal movement. For a more charismatic study Bible see the Spirit-Filled Study Bible published by Thomas Nelson and edited by Dr. Jack Hayford."
3,Inspiring to Holy Living,"After having read some of the reviews given to this Bible, I was concerned about the issue of mercy and grace. Paul teaches us that grace can be taken as far as holiness can be lived. The articles that are found here really urge you toward holy living. It has to be recognized that even though we are free from the law, God hates sin. We cannot go forward and press into the throneroom of grace without a right heart. The Bible helped me recognize that God accepts me despite my sin, but at the same time requires me to press on in holiness. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to be blessed by the Pentecostal/Charismatic theologians of the twentieth century. I have had many of these men as professors one time or another, and even with their hard stance on holy living their love is beyond compare."
5,To bad the Band Broke Up!,"This is one of my two favourite bands. I seen them live 3 time's and got a few of their autographs. He mentioned a new CD but I doubt it is being releases after they have broke up. I'll miss these guy's, so entertaining. Check out www.jfso.com for some news. Every song on this CD is GREAT.HAPPY SWINGIN'!"
5,Outstanding!!!,"This is just a flat-out great swing cd. Unlike many of the other neo-swing groups, Johnny Favorite's orchestra plays songs in different tempos, different styles, different instrument leads. It's not a cd where every song sounds alike. Better buy it before it's out of print."
1,At least it was short.,It's hard to understand how a book can be so loaded with violence and explicit sex and still manage to be so boring. At least it's a fast read.
2,Bad News!,"I could not believe it that 4 other readers rated this book with 5 stars...are they on another planet! Narrow character plot, weak character development, unbelievable dialog and just bad all around writing. Don't waste your time and money on this one when there are so many excellent lisban romance novels available."
2,Not adjustable for hight and the toilet seat is so small,Advantages:Easy to assemble.Does not take much space in the room.Disadvantages:The hight is NOT adjustabl.The toilet seat is so small. The old man can not do number 1 and 2 without making a mess.
2,Too Academic!,"This book is too academic. Managers and consultants should purchase Beitler's ""Strategic Organizational Change"" for real-world advice."
1,I agree,"I agree with some of the other reviewers who recommended ""real world"" books by Beitler, Schein, Kotter, and other authors. Cummings and Worley's work is only helpful if you are an academic trying to understand the real world."
1,Worst ever,"The product did not work on my Dell Inspiron Laptop with windows XP. But TLC does not support Laptops for their program. It says so also on their homepage that this program is not tested for Laptops.Hello, The learning Company!!! it's 2007. Actually most computers are laptops today."
3,Splendid!,"I gave only 3 stars because I liked only 2 songs (Revelations and Sunrise) very much. With Revelations, Shankar has extended the limit of what a violin can do. It truly feels as though 4-5 people were playing violin at the same time. He is probably the fastest violinists I've known. The remaining songs are good too, but these two are a class apart. He comes up with something unexpected every time.-Shanker"
2,Not Purely Double Violin - It's New Age,"I saw Gingger perform on the double violin. She was accompanied by a fine tabla player and the performance was great. I have Shankar's Pancha Nadai CD and so when I saw this one of the two performing together I thought great! I'm sure there are many who will love this music, but as I could not find any disclosure that this was not purely double violin I thought I better add this review."
2,HUGE!!!!!!,"i havent used them as of yet, but they were so big they could barely even fit in the package. they seem like good gloves though, besides the fact that they look like Mickey Mouse gloves."
3,Truly unique music!!,"I first heard Phoenix's remix of Air's ""Kelly Watch the Stars."" They took the song and completely turned it into something else entirely, very impressive. Then came ""Heat Wave"" on ""Source Material"" another great track. Finally after hearing ""If I Ever Feel Better"", I was completely sold. That song, which is on ""United"" is truly unbelievable. It has an uptempo feel, (I listen to it to get pumped up sometimes) in a downtempo way. The lyrics are beauitul as is the singer's voice. So I bought ""United"". Phoenix have a completely unique sound. They sound as they are out of the 70's and yet there is freshness to the music. The songs on this album jump around, don't expect them to sound anything alike. But in a good way, there is diversity on this record. Phoenix are a great band if you are looking for something new and something fun."
4,"Really cool,nostalgic rock debut by French newcomers","By listening to United , you can easily realize how much Phoenix love the music from past decades . Maybe because they come from France and english is not their mother tongue , they write their lyrics so carefully . Their first hit "" If I Ever Fell Better"" is an uplifting , relaxing song which at the same time though , contains some of the most mature and optimistic lines we've seen in a chart's single the last few years ( ""...It's like a bad day that never ends / I feel the chaos around me / one thing i don't try to deny / i've been alone to accept that / there are things in my life i can't control"" ) . Other great tracks which dezerve your attention are "" Summer Days "" , "" Too Young "" , "" Party time "" and "" On Fire "". Bands like Phoenix never get the hype they dezerve . Their first offering though is the intellegent listener's afternoon album , a record both to enjoy and to love."
4,Good Stuff,"Overall this a good album, not as strong as their next album ""Alphabetical,"" but it's pretty good. This band is a lot more solid sounding than bands like The White Stripes & The Strokes (both waaaaay overhyped in my mind). It's a refreshing sound that has a permanent spot on my playlists."
4,Solid record,This is a record I'd advise listening to on a play-through - it's not as full of catchy singles like Phoenix's more recent 'Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix' but it's still a really good one.
5,Killer Tunes,"I spent some time looking for it in stores, and was not able to locate it. I bought United on the basis of how Too Young sounded to me. It is a very lively and refreshing song which I first heard on the Shallow Hal Soundtrack. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the rest of the album. It is great from start to finish. I hope that Phoenix comes out with new stuff soon."
2,little if no Air!,"this band is forever being compared to Air which i personally cannot understand. if you like Air for its subtle moodiness then you wont find anything of the sort with the obviousness of Phoenix, in a comparitive sense...that is."
4,Todd Rundgren,Anyone who was alive in the 70's and doesn't think of Todd Rundgren when they hear this isn't listening. They played this all summer in Paris...It was reallly hot.
3,hype,"French Rock, sounds like Paul Simon and Hootie & the Blowfish.Don't buy this thinking it's electronic music, dance music, or SourceLab. I made that mistake and will be passing this on to someone who likes it."
1,worst album i've ever purchased.,THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD IT IS. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
1,I feel dirty!,"When I heard this album I felt violated, but not in a good way... it conjured thoughts of seedy 70's night clubs with tight leather pants being the compulsory dress code..."
3,VB and Back-End devices need to be considered,"This book would be more effective if it addressed the Visual Basic / SQL-Server platform as well as C++. My company receives files from areas within the US / Canada and Mexico. Soon we will be receiving files from Asia (in Text and Excel format). This Unicode Character set poses problems for us in the way we read the input files, load data to SQL-Server, display the data and most of all , extract the data for upload to SAP)-- since the U.S. is the central location for data collection Unicode impacts us greatly. I would have been nice to see these type of areas addressed."
3,Not her best work,"I read ""Just Desserts,"" and found it pretty interesting, and was looking forward to seeing what happened with Judith and Joe, her high school boyfriend from several years ago. While this book mentions Joe and there is some slight interaction, it seems to me to be long and rambling, and the ""Sacred Eight"" characters are just annoying. I may try to read the next in the series, but I'm struggling to finish this one! Have no doubts, I WANTED to enjoy this book, but it seems tedious and slow-moving."
2,Won't read another one !,"I bought this book after noticing it rated 5 stars from someone that i had noticed had read and felt the same way about other books that i really liked. Thankfully I didn't read the first one (it was not liked at all). But 5 stars ? I forced myself to read the whole thing, it is a thin book, waiting for it to get better and it just never did. The characters were overly quirky but at the same time weakly developed. The was no one to cheer for or identify with. I love reading and like nothing more than to sink myself into a good book. Am always looking for new authors to try. If anyone has suggestions pass them on!"
5,Dark and Delightful,"If short stories are one of your favorite guilty pleasures you owe it to yourself to check out the first collection by Nicholas Kaufmann. And ignore the phrase ""first collection"" if it suggests a lack of depth and maturity, Kaufmann's work spans several countries expertly using setting to reflect themes and his writing touches on topics from McCarthyism to modern urban angst in a way that reflects each era he selects. He entertains Baby Boomers and their children with equal ease.""The Jew of Prague"" alone makes this book worth reading. Like all the stories in this collection, it's complexity and depth are the subtext of a compelling tale. The reader constantly wants to know what happens next.Most of these stories have (unfortunately) appeared previously in small niche markets cheating Kaufmann out of the wide readership his works deserve."
4,Very Inspiring,"Infinite Spaces is lean on the commentary and abundant in beautiful full color photos displaying a wide variety of magnificent Japanese gardens. Some are from temples and others from private properties. This is not a repetitive book that displays the same Kyoto gardens like many that have been published.While some are from Kyoto, Eric Miller's review suggests most of the gardens are located around Kyoto. This is not accurate at all. In fact, what's so incredible about this book is the authors traveled virtually the whole country and shot incredible gardens the whole length of Japan. Gardens are documented from the following regions: Nara, Shiga, Tottori, Ehime, Yamaguchi, Nagano, Nagoya, Tokushima, Yamagata, Tokyo, Ishikawa, Shizuoka, Fukuoka, Mie, Kumamoto, Wakayama, Iwate, Aomori, Yamanashi, Fukui, Niigata, Aichi, Kanagawa, and Gifu.Awesome! Tons of great inspiration here. I highly recommend it."
2,Not Impressed,"The author of this book is a garden designer not a floral designer, and there is a big difference. To me, two stems of Casablanca lilies by themselves in a vase (page 95) is not an arrangement worthy of two pages in a book. There was not one arrangement in the pages that I found to be anything other than leaves or sticks in a pot or jar. The arrangements were pretty and simple, yes, but the photography was really what this book was about. It couldn't have been about the floral design as there wasn't any."
5,This is a wonderful book!,"I received this book in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised. Hadn't dared to hope it would be this good. As I turned through it for the first time I found myself ""oohing and aahing"".I ordered it as a possible source of inspiration and reference material for drawing/painting and I was definitely not disappointed this time. I have been disappointed before, many times, by books that seem to show nothing much except blossoms. Hardly a leaf or stem, let alone a container. (Might as well buy packs of flower seeds for the pictures on them.)Well, I like leaves, stems, and containers. If you do, too, you will probably like this book. Yes, there are some blooms in it, they just aren't the main focus of the book. After all, there is other beauty in the plant world besides just blossoms!"
5,Highly Recommended,"This is a historical novel about Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World, and the famous lost colony of Roanoke. This is extremely well-written, with lively characters. Sure, the book is ""old"", but it's *historical*--it doesn't become dated! I have read it many times, first when I was fairly young and again when I was older. It holds up. I have to say, I don't know if men/boys would like it as well as women/girls. Suitable for all ages--there is a romance, but NO bodice-ripping! And it's educational in the way that you don't notice that you're learning, you're interested in the story. At the risk of repeating myself: Highly Recommended!"
5,Something every internet use should read.,"Every internet user should be required to read at the least the first chapter of this book. It eloquently explains why spam is a serious problem and not just an annoyance. The technical information could have been more in depth, but I feel it is sufficient to get the beginning spam fighter started with online resources."
2,details the broad issues - not specifics,"Heavy on pressenting and summarizing issues without many praticalities. It should be titled - Techniques to use in reducing Spam. I would have liked to be presented with the techniques that summarize how Spam companies think as I get most, if not all, of my Spam through one or more junk email companies."
3,A dated book.,"It is an old book so some of the info is rather dated.However, it is good for a historical perspective and it gives an ok overview of the whole concept.It will not give you answers to what you need to do as much of the spamming techniques have changed since it's publishing.For example HTML based spam, spam fighing software, and Baysean formula came after this.It was a book for its time but it has passed."
4,Lots of information and exactly enough help,"Though I took copious notes on reading headers, reporting mail fraud, and tracing spammers back to their sources, this book solved my problem with one simple piece of advice. I set a filter in Netscape to shunt any mail that doesn't have part of my own email address in its ""To:"" field into a ""low priority"" folder, except for a few mailing lists (like Suck) that I actually want. It works perfectly. The junk e-mail doesn't clutter up my inbox, and I can get rid of it all with a glance and a click."
1,No userful information,"Yes, ORDB does recommend this book for server administrators with open relay. However, this server administrator found no information in the book that would be helpful in closing an open relay. Complete waste of money and time."
3,Great high-level view of the problem with Spam,"This book covers the problems with Spam- and what one can do to stop it- quite well. However, it isn't of much use to the system administrator trying to implement anti-relay techniques (POP before SMTP in particular), RBL-style blacklists, etc. Not that the Bat book is much better-- you can't open it, read a chapter, and protect yourself immediately..."
2,So So...,"The boxed set does NOT include a Mac OS X version. If you want that, you should buy the separate version specifically for OS X. The windows version is actually not as featured filled as the OS X version."
5,My 4 yr old twins LOVE this!!,"My 4yr old twins love this and they take turns with each game. They love the music and it is a great tool for matching, math and reading. Rarely do I find something to play with that BOTH kids love and this is one of those rare occaisions."
3,how to install this product,"first goto http://support.broderbund.com/faq_list.asp?id=1294820928this will tell you almost everthing about how to install this productIMPORTANT::when you follow the directions from the website above, when you get to the quicktime install, select Skip when it asks you to check automaticly for missing files.you will also need to uninstall the previous quicktime first"
1,Not as good as the usual Van Gieson,"Protagonist Neil Hamel blames her troubles on a gray stray cat (who, sadly, gets trapped and hauled to the pound). The real culprit is a dull plot, boring characters, and flat dialog. Normally I look forward to the next Neil Hamel, but in this case better to have kept the cat and hauled this book to the dump."
3,Good Wrestling - Entertainment lackluster,This is a good not great video with spectacular wrestling matches but for the wwf attitude style tape go with something else!

3,Nice but costly,"I am very interested in this region of China so I decided to spring for the book. However, at $60 (Full price, no discouts found) it is very expensive and a bit disappointing for what you get. There's not a lot of text and the photo quality (size, paper, printing quality) is good but not great. I personally don't regret the purchase as comprehensive books on the region are somewhat limited, but unless you are VERY interested in this region I would suggest you try something else."
2,Duped,"Was led to believe in the details about the book that it was clean and in good condition. After paging through it I discovered several places where the book has handwritten underlining in red and black, handwritten brackets, and writing in the margins."
3,Not so good story for a Baum book but the illustrations...!,The illustrations are ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICANT (especially the color plates!) John R. Neil actually hand-colored the plates instead of having the printer at Reilly and Britton do it. The story would of got 1 or 2 stars because it is quite dark and unlike the fantasies we are used to by Baum. But the illustrations are what gets the stars. It's book #4 in the series of 40 BOOKS and it's worth reading although not a tightly-constructed quality story.
3,"Good, but to find some subject it fails","The material is very helpful. But the mechanism to search quickly some subject is awful. I have read the printed version and it is much easier to find out the subject. For example, you type prostate cancer and it returns more de 40 entries."
3,good but has a sugar-free fake flavor,I like it but I usually add 50% pomegranite juice to it and enjoy it quite a bit more.
4,Oddly Good,Has a weird after taste but over all it's good and way better than even diet soda with no sodium. I'm not sure what a previous rater was talking about I can read all the ingredients in the soda with in my book usally mean it's all natural ingredents. Already bought a couple different flavors to try
4,Rampaging for years...,"I played the original Rampage and when I saw this game I was really excited. My gamer boyfriend just rolled his eyes and said 'I guess you know what you want.' He hasn't put it down since we got it. We enjoy playing it together and while it took a while to get the controls, we keep on having a blast rampaging through the cities. The best thing about multi-player is that it doesn't split your vieweing area. It is a bit repetitive but it has achievements which sets the true gamer into gamer mode. It reminds me of the good ole' days and there is nothing better than a game which brings back the fun of youth. You definitely need the nunchuk and a little room around your seat to smash, swing, twirl, and punch! Definietly worth $20."
2,"Kids played it for a few hrs and lost interest, despite their love for destruction","The title says it all: crappy 2 dimensional gameplay, lack of purpose, too much repetition makes for a crappy game.We gave it away after 2 weeks."
4,Awesome,"I love this game. It's so much fun and the step-kids love it too. Fun for adults and kids. It's a great addition to the Rampage family, pretty nice graphics and lots of monsters to chose from. I also like that it comes with all the other incarnations of Rampage including the original arcade version. Good times. One tip: Play using the nunchucks, makes gameplay so much easier."
3,Game's okay,"This game is okay. I only played it a few times with my son. The game controls could be a little more managable during game play. Other than that, games is okay. You do your typical breaking buildings, eating everything in your sight, with a side mission on every level. For example, eat 5 skate board kids, etc."
3,Oldie but goodie,Used to play a similiar game in the arcade many years ago. Wtih the use of multiplayer this is a good group/party game. Really enjoy playing this with a group.
3,Gets Old Quick,This game is entertaining the first few times through but I can't image that this can be entertaining too many times through. Its the same smashing buildings until your face turns blue.
2,Not that great,"I only paid about $10 for this game so I suppose it's been worth the price. This game has changed very little from the old 80's version. The graphics have improved and there's now more characters to play, but that's about it. My 4yr old son wants to play it on occasion but he gets bored within about 15 minutes."
4,Well whadda ya know...it works!,"I have tried all kinds of whitening products from strips to toothpaste and beyond. I was about to ask my dentist to preform whitening on me as I was so discouraged.I am an avid tea drinker with veneers so my smile was just starting to look a bit on the tarnished side. I however didn't want crazy glowing white teeth. This little system works nicely so that you can whiten a little bit at a time. And it is true that it whitened on the first use.I agree with other reviewers that the mouth peice is a bit uncomfy for small mouths. It is gummy and if you clamp down on it for all 5 minutes your jaw will start to hurt just from the fatiuge.Anyway, it works and if you want to whiten your teeth just a bit or a whole bunch this product is a great alternitive to having your dentist do it."
4,Good for sensitive teeth,"I have sensitive teeth so wearing Crest white strips for 30 minutes makes my teeth ache very badly. However, this product is not too bad. It still gives me slight discomfort, but I am able to wear the product for up to 20 minutes without any issues. It says 5-minutes on the box, but you can do one treatment for up to 20 minutes if you have badly stained teeth. I don't; I just want whiter teeth! Anyway, I follow the directions with one EXCEPTION that I learned from MakeUpGeek.com: dry your teeth off with a tissue before you insert the tray. I learned that the gel would adhere better to dry teeth--works with my logic--and I have experienced good results. I don't do it twice a day, per the instructions, but even with once a day I have seen great improvement. I am actually afraid of doing it to the point where I get a mouth like Ross from Friends! Haha."
2,hmmm,"I dont know how I feel about this product. I used it for a while, it didnt make my teeth super white, in fact I dont even know if I had results. my teeth were bleached years ago and well I only wanted a touch up but I saw no difference."
4,"It works, but not that fast.","It hurts your gums at first, then you will get used to it. Plus, in my opinion, using that tray is the worst efficient thing. They marketed it so we have to buy more of their products, just like normal toothpaste. You can use just a little amount each time with your toothbrush and it'll work better."
2,Doesn't work...,"I bought this and tried two months ago. I used it very often and hoped to see some result, but I have to say it doesn't work to me."
2,Burns,"No way I can keep it in for 5 mins. The gel inevitably does not touch only the teeth. It burns my gums, tongue, and lips. I give it two stars cause it does seem to have some whitening effect even if I can only handle a minute or two."
5,great product,This is a great product. It does the job. I've used it many times .Is as good as dentist brand. If you don't succeed at first try to read the instructionsI highly recommended it .
4,Works like it said it would,"I was impressed with how fast it whitened my teeth, now you are supposed you use it twice a day for two weeks. I only used it once a day while i was in the shower. I noticed within 3 days my teeth were brighter. The only con the tube doesnt last you very long. Its worth a try i thought it worked better than all of the whitening strips on the market"
1,Bad stuff,"I got canker sores on my tongue while using this. It was painful and i couldnt use the product anymore. I also read teeth whiteners can cause cancer. I think its better to spend more money on the strips and not risk the whitener touching your gums, teeth, etc"
1,This was a waste of money!!,So i bought this 5 minute whitening kit because they said it was really good. But when i got it i tried it and it was like it did not work at all. It didn't make my teeth any whiter and believe e i have really yellow teeth because i drink alot of SODA.
5,heaven in a tube!!!!,"okay this may sound funny to you but before this summer i got dumped! and to place my ultimate revenge on my ex i decided to get in massive shape!!!! a week ago i reached my weight lose goal of 25lbs!!!! however i still had two weeks to go till school started so i got this product to do some extra damage on my ex, now my teeth are really white!!!! i leave it on for 15-20minutes and thats it im done! now not only will my new body do the talking, but also my perfect smile to go with it! killing'em with kindness ;)"
1,TUBES BLEW UP,"I SENT A EMAIL TO THE COMPANY AS MY TUBES ALL EXPANDED TO AN EXPLOSIVE SIZE AND WHEN I OPENED ONE OF THE TUBES I ORDERED THE BUBBLING LIQUID CAME SHUTTING OUT. WHEN I PUT IT IN MY WHITENING TRAY IT BURNED MY TONGUE. I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE WITH GOOD RESULTS, ALTHOUGH I HAD WHITENED FROM A GEL THAT I ORDERED THROUGH MY DENTIST. I HAD USED THIS GEL FOR RETOUCHING. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED AND ADVISE IF YOU GET TUBES THAT SWELL UP AND IMPLODE ON OPENING WITH LIQUID BUBBING INSTEAD OF A CLEAR GEL THAT YOU PLEASE DON'T USE IT AND SEND IT BACK!!!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY PLEASE SAVE IT PLEASE DON'T BUY IT,4 words........ IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK!!!! Total waste of my ass busting money. YOU CAN GO SHOVE IT RIGHT UP FOR HAIRY STINKY ASS!
3,Plus+White,"It whitens quick for a little bit, but it is not a whitening that takes attention. It also caused sensitivity on my gum."
2,Works but...,"Bought this from Wal-Mart for 6 dollars and some change. This product seems to work rather well and I noticed results within a day or so. The only problem and thing that has made me stop using it is that the gel is hard to get our of your mouth. I haven't used it in about 2 or 3 days now and this morning was still pulling that nasty gel out of my mouth (and that's with Listerine rinsing/brushing twice a day and flossing once a day... Absolutley disgusting. But, nonetheless, teeth seem whiter."
2,"It is too liquid, they do not produce gel that is a water. And the green little bottle is enough for 10 times of bleaching","They used to make this product quite effective. As a matter of fact it makes your teeth whiter.It works, BUT recently (1-2 years) the product is too liquid, it is not a gel it is water, how am I supposed to put it on the tooth?!?!?! And the green concentrate that you dissolve in water is enough for 9 to 11 bleaches and then what am I to do with this watery gel and no green prep?!?!?! Really dissapointed"
3,"Not miraculous, but ok","It worked to get my teeth whiter, but it wasn't amazing or anything. On the bright side, it didn't make my teeth hurt like the crest white strips do, so that was nice."
2,Not for me,I bought this kit based on a recommendation I read. I don't even try to use it any more because I cannot get the plastic guard molded to fit. It is too large and I can't get it tight enough to my teeth to do any good.
2,5 Minute whitening gel,"The package i received it in was quite bashed up, but, i didnt think that wud affect the product inside. but. this product didnt really do much for me, in fact, it didnt make any difference at all. sorry for the downer review!"
2,would not recomend this,"I wanted to try this because of the price, but I guess you get what you pay for... I wasnt impressed with this product at all. It says to put a small amount on the mouth tray but thats about impossible... the gel is so thick and the opening of the tub is so big that you cant apply a small amount. and it says to wipe off any gel from a place other than your teeth but I couldnt after I put in the tray. It was so thick that it got on my tounge and gums, I was able to wipe off my gums but I couldnt wipe it off my tounge after I put in the mouth tray... and to top it off, I went threw all this and didnt see hardly any results. I wouldnt recoment it."
1,NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!,"The first time I use it I felt sick but I did not connect to the product then I used again another day, and again I GOT very SICK no more of it for me into the garbage!! BE CAREFUL!!!"
1,Dont seem to work at all...,"I used it for a week dont notice anything, and its annoying to use that mouth tray cause of spit gets in your mouth within the 5 minutes.. and its very uncomfortable"
3,5 minute,"Bonjour,Ce produit est un bon produit mais je n'ai pas reu le bon produit j'ai commandé le quite et je n'ai reu que le gel...Bon courage à vous."
1,My review on the super whitening system,"Hi everyone!I've used this product for around 2 1/2 weeks, used it twice a day for approx. 20min, and the result was not really as I expected! I definitely will not buy this stuff anymore and will try to found out some other whitening product that suits my needs far much better! Sorry to say this, but I think this 5-min Plus White System is a waste od money!P.S. At least the delivery speed was fantastic, 7-day total! However, this can't make up for the results that were not even close to those stated on the product!"
2,BURN MY GUM!!!,"I'm Asia and my teeth is a bit yellow. So I decided to give it a try because it's so cheap. I bought this from walmart since it's much cheaper ($5) there. I applied the gel first time this morning and it was ok, my gum hurt a bit. However, when I reapplied it again this evening, it burned my gum even I did carefully wiped any gel out. But once the gel touched my gum, it burned my gum and hurt so much. I couldn't endure it even one minute. Now my gum is white and swollen. I don't know if it will work but I won't try it again. Please consider before buying."
2,may work but it hurts,I used it twice today and it hurt so much! First the upper right on my gums were in a lot of pain. It burned. I tried my best to not let it touch my gums but it's inevitable. Then I just used it 10 minutes ago and the bottom right of my gums were burning! It hurt so much and when i took it off on area where my tooth and gum were was completely white! My gum was white and I looked diseased! I was so scared but my mom said it was most likely plaque that the gel stuck onto when i applied it that made it look that way. It honestly just burns to much. I understand pain is beauty sometimes but i'll deal with the couple yellows I have in my mouth for now. Lol. I only have about 4 teeth on the sides of my mouth that aren't white so I'm def returning this at walmart ASAP!
1,Does not work!!!,I used whole product and I followed directions but product did not make ANY difference at all. Waste of money...
4,Hercules Hercules!,Its big! Real Big. A little too big for in the pocket. Unless you don't mind your pants falling down. Its great for working around the house doing chores. The kids always have something i need to fix. This just needs a simple nylon case to attach to belt.
3,Visually disappointing,"I was anxious to get this knife, and was a little disappointed with its appearance. In lieu of the traditional bright red glossy cover is a dull, satin deep maroon vinyl-feeling cover. Had I realized this (and I thought I read the description), I would have foregone this purchase. It is still a very serviceable tool, but visually, it leaves much to be desired."
4,Good color-templete bad,"The color was great but the ""tracing templetes"" are huge! I have a lg face and all 3 sizes were way too big for my face. The color was nice and the product stayed on when I ""free handed"" it."
5,Excellent,"I really appreciate this book. Patty Duke tells her story well and I applaud her for having the courage to let the whole world know about her private adversities, especially her struggle with illness. Since learning more about Patty Duke, I also highly recommend a little book by Taro Gold called ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" which contains many inspirational thoughts based on the Buddhism that Patty Duke practices. Excellent."
4,"It's the Journey, Not the Destination","The miracle of it all is that Patty Duke has emerged from all her troubles as a kind and generous person. Obviously a talented actress, she is also willing to reveal parts of her life that few of us would even want our closest confidants to know about. Her path has not been an easy one but it's an inspiring tale for others battling manic depression."
2,Call Me Anna,"No wonder the book shipped in 2 days. I know it's an old book, but the cover was more than ""shelf worn"" as described! Had coffee rings on the dust jacket the book/spine was dirty and worn. Won't shop here again for a ""new book""."
1,Thanks alot,"Definitely read it. It's interesting. But this book is detrimental to public perception of manic depression, no matter how well Ms Duke meant by writing this book and then allowing the movie version. Yes, bipolar causes us (yeah, I have it too) to do some pretty dramatic things that look great and dramatic in books and movies. It gets attention and craziness sells. But as a person living responsibly with controlled bipolar, I can't appreciate this book or the film that followed it. The insurance company that refused to cover me must have seen it too."
5,The most touching and inspirational book I've ever read,"This book has to be one of the best autobiographies ever written. Anna Marie Duke is so brutally honest and sincere in her writings that gives the book such appeal. It was the only book I have read that made me laugh and cry all the while educating, touching, and inspiring me."
4,A look inside a bipolar mind,"This provides an excellent first-hand account of what it is like to live with the powerful destructive and wonderfully creative aspects of Bipolar Disorder. It also reinforces the importance of appropriate, early diagnosis and treatment.Sheryl Gurrentz, authorIf Your Child is Bipolar"
5,Highly recommended,Very interesting book. Patty is very open and I want to research her movies and see the ones I missed. It was also intriguing to read about fellow stars she socialized with.
4,Interesting!!,I really enjoyed reading about Patty's life. She had it tough. Lots of interesting facts. If that's what it takes to be a famous actress... I'm glad to be me.
3,Poor little Ptty...,"I have always been a fan of ""early"" Patty Duke as an actress - especially as Hellen Keller. This book was surprisingly well written and truthful but she is obviously not a writer. An interesting life and one it was nice of her to shaer. But bipolar is getting boring - everyone has it now......."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!!!,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FROM PATTY DUKE. AS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL FROM THE TITLE HER REASL NAME IS ANNA. VERY INTERESTING BOOK. YOU FEEL SO SAD FOR PATTY..... ER ANNA. WHAT A TERRIBLE LIFE SHE HAD WITH THE ROSSES. SHE DISERVED TO FINALLY GET HER OWN SHOW AND SHE HAD SOME HIT RECORDS AND THEN SHE WAS IN SOME MOVIES AS WELL. SHE REALLY DESERVED ALL THAT. SHE REALLY IS A GREAT ACTRESS. VERY INTERESTING BOOK YOU WILL ENJOY IT AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY THAT YOU BOUGHT THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON.
4,Bubblegum girl pop? Think again...,"Hilary Duff's new album is certainly not bubblegum girl pop, and this first-to-be-released song proves it. ""Fly"", the inspirational and bohemian Pop Rock hit spreads it's wings and flies into the hearts of new and old Hilary fans. You don't even have to be a fan to like this song.While many may tell you it's all hype and no content, the song is catchy and likable the more you listen to it. Hilary's growing up, and so is her music."
4,My son love it!,"My son is truly obsessed with numbers. He stares at the clock watching it change so I thought this would be a great gift for him. He SLEEP with it! He loves pressing the ""real time"" button and telling all of us what time ""clocky"" says it is. I love that it teaches him about a manual clock as well."
1,DRIVES ME NUTS. It won't turn off!!!,I bought this for my niece as a birthday present and her parents actually gave it back to me!!! They said it chimes constantly on the hour and they can't turn it off! I'm finding the same problem. I've put it on the lowest volume and basically stuck it in my daughter's dresser. This toy would otherwise be a great learning tool...if we can at least control it!
3,displeased,"I thought I overpaid for this product. The box that it came in said $19.99 and I was charged $50.00 including shipping. I felt the product is not worth $50.00. The only reason I kept it cause I could not find childs learning clock in a local store, but I will never never never do it again. Very disappointed by this company."
3,"Kids love it, parents hate it","Like other reviewers say, this clock doesn't have an OFF switch. There is a blue music note button to silent it so it doesn't chime (or moo or crow) on every hour and half-hour, but the children are always pushing it so most of the time this clock is NOT silent. I gave this product 3 stars because our 3yr old & 1yr old LOVE it and it's a great learning tool. We would probably buy it again if we had to do it over simply because they learn so much from it and play with it all the time."
4,My daughter loves it,"I bought this clock for my 5 year old daughter to help her with learning to tell time. This clock has a digital clock that you match the bigger clock's dial to. Even if the times don't match, the clock will tell you what time you put the hour and minute hands on. I would recommend this for anyone that has a stubborn child when it comes to trying to teach them!"
2,Poor Idea - Poor Construction,"I was really disappointed when this showed up. The first one arrived broken. The second one was so loud, even on the ""low volume"", we had to put tape over the speaker. Took 15 minutes just to ""program"" it with the correct time. Then, as another reviewed noted, the darn thing can't be shut off. Half the night you hear it making animal sounds and chiming noises. What idiot designs these things? I find it confusing in the manner in which it attempts to teach time, and will have to find something better. Very little thought went into this thing."
1,Thin lightweight towels,"I expected a hefty, absorbent, bath sheet but not so. Sent them back - are poor quality for the money."
5,512MB SD Memory Card does the job,The memory card was delivered promptly.It suits my needs at areasonable price.It works well in my application.
1,This product is not original,"When I saw it, I thought that I was buying something Good, Because it seemed like a good price and good condition , but the thing is that when I recieved this product, I realized that it was not original, It's just a copy..I regreted a lot about having spent my money in this crappy."
3,"Good, but very light","I bought this product due to the recommendation of a coworker, who liked the women's version. I can not really smell the product when I put it on; it's very light, but I have received some compliments on it, so I cannot discount it. It gives off a light, woody sent that smells plesant, but not strong. I like it, but it does not last long in my opinion. I think it's good if you want a modest, non-overwhelming smell, but if you desire attention for this scent, it will require a lot more sprays, and there are other scents that are stronger and more bold. Really, I wonder what other people think about this? Well, until later, I hope that all enjoy it."
2,Suspect,"I owned this cologne before and loved it. I just received this bottle and it seemed a bit suspect. The seller states 100% authentic, so perhaps it sat in high temps? Either way, since the scent seemed off I went to the mall to compare on opposite arms and the two did not smell the same.I don't care for it, but my sis says it still smells good so I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. I'm left disappointed with the purchase :("
1,Fake don't buy!!!!!!!,"Looks like DKNY be delicious for men but it is completely fake it smells like they put this horrible, old man cheap cologne scent in a be delicious bottle. I just wasted $50."
4,Husband's favorite,I bought this item as a gift for my husband for Christmas. I wasn't able to find it in any of the stores at the mall or elsewhere in town. DKNY is his favorite cologne and was happy that he didn't have to switch to another product.
4,Glasses Are Cool!,"In this delightful tale D.W.,Arthur's little sister wants to wear glasses like he does.""They look cool,"" she tells him.He explains to her how things look to him when he does not wear his glasses, like a hat looking like a bat.D.W. pretends she can't see but once the children are about to play soccer, she is cured. This little book has nice illustrations and is a good one for children who wear glasses and may wish they didn't. He will help them feel better about themselves. Good idea.Shirley Johnson"
3,Left me with a sense of disappointment...,"Based on the title and the synopsis that I read, I fully expected to enjoy this book...and I did for the first few chapters. After that I started becoming totally turned off by Lucinda's stereotyping and narrow-mindedness. I found her choice for a partner (Mason) baffling and eventually appalling and her actions and feelings towards his children disturbing. I'll admit that there were parts that drew me in and I did get a big laugh out of a few others, but overall I was left with a sense of emptiness. I don't know if it's that Lucinda and I took drastically roads after college, but I just could not relate to her in the least, let alone empathize with her. Overall, it was just not a very satisfying read."
3,"from New York to ""the sticks""","This book began as a sad commentary on modern life but it did pick up a bit towards the end. It was the book selected for our bookclub. I missed the meeting so I can't add comments from others on the book, but it would not be my first choice."
1,Drivel,"I suspect Meghan Daum makes a good journalist, though I haven't read her autobiography or any of her non-fiction articles. She puts a good sentence together and has a good eye for human foibles. Unfortunately, none of this makes her a good novelist. This book was not in the slightest compelling. The main character was too cliche to be interesting and the other characters drawn too superficially to be interesting either. Much of the book centered around her crazy love for an unlikely type -- unfortunately, we never had any idea what she liked about him. Or him about her. The plot? It was more like a three-sentence pitch for a movie. The writing: adept. I hate not finishing books once I've started them but this one was hard to trudge through. About half way through I started skimming."
4,Closely Observed Social Satire,"Moving from New York City to the heartland, Lucinda Trout is suddenly a fish out of water. There will be no more plot recap in this review since everyone else has already done that. Let me just say that as a reader who grew up in Kansas and Missouri and has lived for the last 20 years in Philadelphia, I loved Daum's dead-on descriptions of the East Coast and the Midwest. She manages to skewer the TV business as well as rural meth labs, earnest hefty lesbians and shallow skeletal heterosexual women, the Manhattan friend who drifts from one glamorous spot to another and the drifter boyfriend who moves from woman to woman, from A-frame (a perfect Midwestern reference!) to farm and back again. Vivid characters, snappy dialog, clever observations and some beautifully turned phrases kept me completely entertained. Apart from Lucinda's love of the word ""reductive"" (a flaw she has in common with the author), I found Lucinda, and her plight, fascinating."
4,Worth Reading,"The Quality of Life Report is a quick, easy, and worthwhile read. It isn't especially deep or meaningful, making it a great choice for the beach or poolside.Although I have lived in the midwest my entire life, reading this book made me realize that I, like Lucinda, have always considered myself better than my surroundings. Having said this, I can relate to Lucinda's getting drawn into some of the local traditions. Meghan Daum does portray an accurate picture of a Midwestern community, albeit condescending and stereotypical. I will admit to baking my skin in a tanning bed, getting acrylic nails, and knowing more than one person with a meth habit. Come to think of it, I have also seen women holding hands in our local Wal-Mart. Read this book for some humor, just don't expect too much out of the story and you won't be disappointed."
3,Entertaining Read,"This book is entertaining and engrossing. I, like other reviewers, had a hard time putting this one down, and really was rooting for the protagonist, a journalist. For someone whose profession is to be a keen observer of human behavior, she seemed to be blind to the fact that she had a Very Bad Boyfriend. This seemed a bit out of place to me, but other than that, the book is a good diversion. Good summer reading."
3,Good Start - Weak Finish,"I was looking for a fish out of water tale and this book seemed to fit the bill. The beginning of the story is well defined and moves quickly. The heroine is quirky and adventurous and ready for a defining moment in her life. Unfortunately, the tale loses steam two thirds through and I found myself wishing for the end."
3,promising!,"I enjoyed this book. I'm the same age as the author, working and (formerly) living in NYC and I remember an essay she wrote about going broke in NYC that I very much identified with.This book is good. I had it on vacation, and it's a nice balance of being a quality read without being painfully literary. I appreciated the opportunity to read something that really did make me laugh out loud quite a bit without having to put up with a garish pink, chick-litty book cover.The story was good over all, and particularly resonant to anyone who who's lived in and left NYC. The end was probably the least strong but I would certainly look forward to reading Megan Daum's next book."
2,"Started off good, but went downhill&#65533;","Lucinda Trout, a New York TV producer on an assignment in the Midwest, falls in love with little Prairie City. The reason she has been originally sent there is to examine the huge meth problem they seem to have. Otherwise, Prairie City seems like your typical Midwestern town, although it does seem to have an excess of lesbians. That aside, the Lucida you meet at the beginning of the book is bored with her life, and wants to change it. She convinces her bosses that she should live in Prairie City for a year and sent ""Quality of Life Reports,"" back home to show New Yorkers what life is like. Somehow that Lucinda from the beginning of the novel quickly finds herself with a house in the middle of nowhere, an irritating boyfriend, and his three children (from three different women) who float in and out of their lives. By the end of the book I really wanted to just slap the main character across the face! Not a recommend read."
4,Relocation Blues,"This novel began with the promise of discovering what it's like for a woman to take action and find out for herself if there really is a better life outside of New York City. There are comic moments, but some of the lives of the women she interviews, with the drugs, etc., are just plain sad. I wanted her to make a difference in their lives, but most of the time she seemed to need their help. The middle of the book seems overlong, maybe because she keeps hanging on to an obviously unsatisfying relationship. I kept hoping she'd discover the value of having given up her old life, but the ending was a disappointment."
3,Characters Flat rather than Colorful.,"Young New York television reporter moves to the midwest in search of a better quality of life but seems to make all the wrong choices. Some laugh out loud parts, but what are supposed to be quirky characters from both NY and the Midwest seemed flat and unreal to me - and the worst part, mostly unlikable. I couldn't find any redeeming qualities in Lucinda - and toward the end of the book, after all the crap she has been through, says that ashamedly she admits being uninteresting was the truly unacceptable condition. Shallow, shall we say?"
1,BORING,"The worst thing about this book is not that it indulges in stereotypes. The worst thing is not that the prose leaves much to be desired. The worst thing is not the condescension. The worst thing is not the ""witty"" conversational rejoinders that sound like the tired one liners that a hack comedian has been using for years (and that Daum must have been carefully compiling). No, the worst thing is that it's boring and predicatable. Despite the attempt to give the story a dramatic ""twist,"" it just falls flat. There's no real plot. There's no drama. Snore. Yawn. ZZZZZZ. Maybe the problem is that the author tried to mine too much of her own experience, not realizing that real life isn't always that interesting."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to a fun, dream of open space and country life made reality for a city girl: I got this. However, the main character is really disappointing, shallow and not well developed by the author. Lucinda is not a very likeable character: she decides to move out in the country in the middle of nowhere, yet she criticizes everything about the people and the place. She is there to work, yet we only learn about something like 3 work-related projects she does in the whole book which covers something like 2 years and she seems to spend her time doing nothing. She is not a reliable friend, she uses her acquaintances for her own purpose and after what her experience in Prairie City has been, I wonder why she stays.Overall it's a very disappointing book. If you're looking for mere entertainment, you have it, but don't look for more."
2,Read it if you have time to kill....,"I was excited to receive and get started on this book. Unfortunately, that's where the excitement ended. The story plot was confusing at times. The charachters were poorly created stereotypes and the story line was so over the top. It seemed that the author heard that meth was a problem in the Midwest, so that would be the entire plot of her novel!There are several funny parts to this story, but overall, can't say that I'd recommend it to anyone. If you're desperate for something moderately humourous, this might be your book. If you're looking for anything intellectually stimulating, read anything else."
4,The Quality of Life Report,"Although it took me a couple of chapters to really get into this book, it was well worth it. I found this an enjoyable, easy read. Lucinda leaves New York City to spend a year living in a midwestern town, Prairie City. The book addresses many stereotypes a lot of people might form about small town life. Ironically, Lucinda's problems become much larger in Prairie City as she falls into a star-crossed relationship with an outsdoorman.The read is made all the more enjoyable by frequent memos from Lucinda's boss, Faye, whose frequent misspellings always kept me entertained."
3,Good summer read,"I enjoyed the humor in this book but would have liked to see more depth. There was a lot of stereotyping, and the main character comes to some realizations in the end, but they clang false after so much satire/bashing throughout the book. That said, Daum is pretty damn funny and I haven't laughed out loud and hard from a book for a while. Her observations about modern life and it's shallowness is on the money, but she paints most of her characters in very broad strokes which provide for humor but not the depth of feeling that you get from the best fiction."
3,Never really took off...,"The Quality of Life by Meghan Daum just never took off. The book started off getting to know Lucinda Trout as a stereotypical New York woman and her ""stereotypical"" New York ways. When she decides to up and move away from it all to Prarie City, the story loses steam, slowly.I found it lacking in character development of Mason, her new love interest in Prarie City. Were they really in love? Was this a relationship of convenience?? I often found I didn't ever find out about the other characters, enough to want to continue reading.The story had a lot of potential, but I felt character development was lacking, the storyline jumped around a bit, and I felt it was a bit unrealistic and at times demeaning.All in all, it was an OK read, but I did have trouble staying with it. Disappointedly, not my idea of a great summer read."
4,Great Product,"I was reading the disappointing reviews for this product but decided that I would give it a try anyway since it is about half the price of what I would pay if I bought it from my carrier. I have had it for a couple of days now and I must say it is great and works perfectly with my RAZR V3m. The only thing I can say bad about it is that people can notice when you are using the headset because they say that you are not as loud as if your were using the phone directly, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Other then that it is a great product. Oh yea, the pictured H500 is exactly what I received."
2,No one can hear me on this headset,"I have two of these models. One has the more talk time. Both are not very good. I can hear people fine, but other's have a very hard time hearing me. I even tried it on a RAZR, new Chocolate LG and now an EnV2. It's not the phones, it's the headsets. Don't buy this one or any on that looks like or similar to this."
2,Returned it after trying it for a couple days..,Pros:* Eye candy - it's a cool looking headset.Cons:* Audio level at its highest level is low. I had to push it against my ear to hear better.* It didn't feel very secure on my ear. Slight head movements can make it move around/off the ear.* People I called sometimes complained of an echo.
3,Very Average,"Although not the best and not the worst BT headset, it ""worked"". Often times, it sounded as if the caller was speaking through foam with a low, audible hiss. The caller on the other ended heard us fine, sometimes they said we sounded ""far away"". I've used multiple BT headsets, thus the average score - it works, not the greatest clarity, but not the worst."
4,great little pieece,"I have owned this headset for about 3 years now. The great thing about it is the clearity of the sound and the fact that i can also play music on my phone and listen to it through the earpiece. It can get a little uncomfortable and the battery life is really short. I use it while driving so my usage isn't very long. If your like me, this will do the job."
1,I still haven't recieved what I ordered in April.,I can't even rate him on the product because I haven't even recieved the item that I ordered from him in the middle of April. I don't know what the hold up is but I sent whomever a email and I still haven't heard back from them either. Customer Service with these individuals isn't really up there for me.
5,good product,I had brought the pink motorola ear piece and when a friend saw mine and asked how it worked. I said comfortable and great they wanted me to order them one so this is the second order of this product.
4,"good headset, my first time with bluetooth","I like this headset because it's not big, bulky, complicated, or ugly. It has a volume up and down button and an on/off button. Just what I wanted, nothing fancy, but still looks nice. Easy to use and comfortable."
2,It works but has a poor sound quality,The Motorola H500 bluetooth is bulky and has a poor sound quality. I wold not recommend it.
1,Quality not as good as it used to be.,"I've ordered a few of these before, for me and my mother inlaw. They worked great. But these last two I purchased have taken a serious nose dive in sound quality. Voices comming through the headset are now very distorted and I have to ask people to repeat themselves alot. I'm only keeping mine till I can find a better one then I'm tossing it. My wife was so frustrated with her's she won't even touch it."
4,Very Good....,"I recommend it to anyone that wants a cheap bluetooth head set. It is a little bit loose on my ear, but it works perfectly."
2,"""Are you muffled?""","I get tones of people complaining that im muffled or asking if im behind a cloth. I also get the question asking ""how far away from the phone are you?"" A GOOD bluetooth is one that the receiver of the call cant tell your using."
3,Meh,"Not the worst thing around but still a bit awkward. Sometimes I would have difficulty turning it on/off as the device would bounce to another command on the multi-function key.Also, while it was comfortable. It wasn't very stable. I'd put my sunglasses on or pull them off and have to readjust the devices placement or risk it falling off. It always felt a bit unstable anyways unless I didn't have my sunglasses on but living in southern california, sunglasses are a daily necessity."
3,motorola,The price was right but i would go with something smaller next time. doesn't sit on my ear too good. last a good amount of time.
2,Can you still hear me?,"Motorola puts out some very good products, but this one (Motorola H500 Headset) was a real disappointment. It is compact and easy to sync to a phone. But the volume is way, way, too low to be useful in most stituations, particularly traffic. I have adjusted it a number of times to the highest setting and it is about half the volume of other bluetooth ear pieces I have. Good price, poor buy."
1,smartymarty,"The H500 that I purchsed stinks.I get nothing but complaits from people that I am speaking to that its garbold and can only hear every other word.I can honestly say that I never been through so much dissatisfaction with a product ever. Maybe this bluetooth earpiece wasn't designed for my Razor phone even though they are both made by the same company.Hey motorola do us all a favor,start testing your products before you sell'em."
3,AVERAGE BLUETOOTH....NOISE INTERFERENCE,"I have used this bluetooth a couple of times (in good reception areas) and those times, each person I talked to said I didn't sounds as good as I could on a bluetooth. On my end, I hear alot of noise background....like an airy sound. Motorola makes better bluetooth devices so don't waste your money on this one....you get what you pay for."
4,Gets the job done,"It works well with my Motorola phone, clear and easy to use. The only problem I have is that it pinches my ear and after wearing it for a while my ear gets sore. I only wear it when I am driving so I can deal with it."
2,"OK, but pocket activates","Functions OK. Not great, OK. It is older technology. Biggest flaw, imo, is poorly designed main control button. If it was recessed, it might be OK. As it is, the button is easily engaged unintentionally. Even in the moto belt clip case specifically designed for this hardware, it accidentally activates. And you are left wondering why your phone says connected but you can't hear anyone.Good price here, much less than I paid years ago. Decent value. Worked fine w/moto razor; sync'ed up with my new blackberry no problem. If you keep it somewhere - when it is not on your head - where it will not activate spontaneously it should get the job done."
2,Eh... not comparable to higher price models,"Ok, so I have had several nice Bluetooth headsets in the past, I'm a heavy user and needed a spare so I picked up this one because I couldn't pass up on the cost savings, and the other reviews for this product were decent.After 2 weeks all I can say is, if you are looking for a good bluetooth, pass this up and shell out the $40 or more dollars to get a better one.Cons:- Several times my connection has dropped mid-call...for no reason (about 5 times over 2000 minutes of use).- Should you ever drop that call...there is no way for you to reconnect without hanging up on the call, and dialing that person/conference back.- You can NOT have the volume turned all the way up (which is sometimes necessary to hear properly, i.e. conference calls) the other person will get their own feedback.Pros:- Price- It does work and call quality is clear.- Its still better than using wired headphones, when it works."
3,Motorola H500 review,It is fine but tends to come on easily in the carry case. People I speak with complain of tinny sound.
2,Too loose and can't hear,"Similiar to other comments, the headset doesn't fit well- too loose and flaps a bit when turning my head. There are also times where I need to press the headset to my ear to hear the other person. This can be annoying on a long conference call and takes away the virtue of being hands free."
3,Good But Not the Best,For the money the HS500 works well. The only thing that an expierenced user may notice is that the sound quality could be a little better but overall it's a good model for the money.
2,Hard to hear you clearly,"I use this in the car and people have trouble understanding what I say. I always must ""Shout"" to be heard. It picks up a lot of backround noise. It also mutes itself on answering and I get more hang ups from people who called and cannot hear me respond. Try another model. This was my first bluetooth headset purchase and I'm looking at a different one."
2,Product didn't work,"This is probably a very good product, as most Motorola products are. The one which I received however did not stay connected to the phone, and it would dial the last called number on its own. It also would beep in your ear all of the time. I sent it back and received a prompt refund, including my shipping costs."
2,Not so good,"The product hardly stays fit in the ear, and both sound and microphone qualities are not so good. I would not recommend it."
3,Only OK,"This Bluetooth's quality is comparable to its relative price, you get what you pay for. There is a large amount of static and a lot of back ground noise present when using it. What upset me the most about it, however, is that the ear hook has broke after about a week."
2,Could be better,"Motorola makes a good product but there are better Bluetooth devices out there i found the H500 not comfortable,it does not fit around your ear properly,it falls easily off your ear and the reception is not all that good."
4,Great Headset!,"Very good headset, the battery doesn't need to be recharged too often, which is very convenient. Good sound quality.The earhook is a little loose, but that isn't a major issue!"
1,Too much static,The headset produced static that could be heard by anyone I called. They couldn't hear my voice over the static. Awful.I bought this for the cheap price and would have given it to my daughter if it was merely not as good as I wanted.It was awful and I returned it for credit.
5,Fantastic transaction,Wonderful transaction-- the product arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend the seller
1,gift return,product was given has a gift. doesn't work. waiting to see if gift reciepiant has problems exchanging or returning.
1,this bluetooth is terrible!,"This bluetooth sucks, i have to yell for people to hear me, people always complain of hearing static from my end. It's easier to use speakerphone on the handset rather than using the headset."
2,Just okay,I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear. It appears to wobble around the ear and leaves me with the feeling that it is going to fall off at any time. I wear eyeglasses and the fit is very poor. There are many better headsets out there that fit more comfortably and do not leave you wondering what is going to happen.
1,Looks cool but doesn't work,I purchased a family plan for my partner and I and we got these for headsets. Within 3 days we exchanged them 3 times each. None of them worked. Even the Verizon salesman couldn't make them work. We were never able to dial out using voice commands and it kept turning itself off and on. And in addition it was very hard to hear incoming calls and they constantly would fall off. We dumped them and bought Plantronics Voyager 510 model G and they work fine. Don't waste your time and money on the H500 Motorola. What's up Motorola?
1,Sorry,"I owned one of these before, the same model and for some reason this one has some much static the other person can not hear you. I am very sorry that I lost my old one and tried to replace it with this one.I wish there was a way for me to return it."
3,H500 Bluetooth,Product is fine only problem i talk at a good level for people to hear me over the blue tooth and they have trouble hearing me and frequesnt clicks and pops occur. Besides that great product
2,Not Handsfree,"This is my first Bluetooth headset and, while I'm impressed with the technology, I was definitely not impressed with the design of this headset. It does not secure very well to the ear which means that the headset flops around on the ear requiring so much re-adjustment during conversation that it negates the moniker ""handsfree."""
3,it works.,1st ear piece i have owned so don't really have comparison. I do know it is sometimes hard to hear and the othe personhas alot of extra noise also.
3,motorola h500,"I don't own this anymore, I gave it to someone that didn't have one. For the time I had it, it worked fine, but I didn't like the quality of the product. I couldn't hear the other person and they couldn't hear me that well either."
4,Fine for the Money,The audio is a little bit fuzzy but this is a great earpiece if you don't do a lot of calling on it. I personally only rely on it in the car and even then seldom use it.
1,Used,Item I received was used. Ii had chipped paint. If item is used please state it in the description of item!
4,Almost perfect..,"I like everything in this bluetooth but it would have been perfect if apart of having a voice command asking you what number you want to call it would have a voice command telling you who is calling. Everything else is very good. Good volume, clarity and reception."
1,it sukes,The Bluetooth dose not connect to the phone when it should it takes too long for to connet so in my mind it is a piece of junk
4,goood at this price,"Its a good product , although being my first bluetooth, easy to configure and use."
1,Works but...,The headset itself works and dials as advertised. I have never had a problem with the recognition by the phone or with people hearing me.MAJOR DOWNSIDE TO THIS HEADSET! If there was a zero option I would use it!My problem is the constant turning on & off of the headset. The slightest pressure turns the headset on or off or worse yet dials the last person you called over and over and over again. My brother had to turn his phone off one night because over a dozen calls were made by my phone becasue the bluetooth headset redialed. This was with the heaset sitting on the counter next to the phone without anything touching it.Because of that I have not used the headset in over a month and left it uncharged. Without a charge it hasn't called once in that time. (Go figure that one. :) )Don't get this headset!!!
2,Could not get to stay on ear,This bluetooth was my first and worst. I couldn't hear alot on it and it didn't stay on my ear for nothing. I would stay away.
1,"Item DOA, no response after return","I received this item DOA, I went through the process to send it back for a return. It has been over 3 weeks and I have not received any form of correspondence from the seller."
4,Decent Bluetooth headset.,This is a fairly good Bluetooth headset. Very easy to use and it feels comfortable when placed on the ear. Audio quality is good as well as the mic. The earpiece though felt a little bit flimsy and would not stay on my ear properly. The one thing though that I had a problem with was the battery life on the headset. I got barely 2 full hours of talk time before it started beeping like crazy which meant that I had to charge it soon.
2,Flimsy bluetooth headset,"To own a bluetooth headset, the right fit is essential. For me, this one lacked comfort. Maybe it's the shape of my ear, but it just never felt sturdy on my ear. Switching from one ear to the other is very simple though. Pairing is very easy as well. Volume is quite low for me, even at its highest level. When talking to someone, they usually tell me that they can't hear me clearly...as if I'm very far away. I can't hear the other person very clearly either...unless I push the headset against my hear with my hand (kind of a bummer when you buy one to be hands-free). When a call comes in, the headset makes its own sound to notify you...which is nice. However, overall, I don't like it. There are better headsets out there, so I suggest you pass on this one."
4,Nice Bluetooth headset,I have been using this headset for a month and basically am happy with the purchase. It's easy to use and works reliably. The only complaint I have is the ear hook is a bit loose and tends to fall off if I lean my head to one side while talking.
3,Works well for price.,Title really says it all. This is a decent product for the cost. Works fine minimal needs.
1,No wonder Verizon gave it to me for free...,"The only upside to this product was the ease in pairing it with my Motorola Q. Perhaps I have abnormal ears, but I could never manage to successfully wear this headset! I tried it on both ears, but it never stayed still, it was always flapping around on the side of my head. Because I never got a firm fit, I had to turn the volume all the way up to use it, but it still wasn't loud enough. If you wear glasses or have small ears, assume you will have the same problems. I've owned the product for nearly a year and have used it about 4 times in total -- absolutely not worth any price, even if the phone store gives it to you for free."
1,Defective,"I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone. Unfortunately I misplaced it. So I eventually bought another one via Amazon. When I got it, it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound. I thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away. It did not. This was suppose to be a brand new headset. It's defective and I did not return it immediately. So I'm giving this supplier a 1 star."
2,Easy to start but one big problem,"I had boughten this as a presnt to my step mother because she was always on the phone due to work. She loved it at first, it was very simple to connect to your phone but when we went to try it out it didnt work as well as I had hoped. I had called her from the home phone and there was mainly just a lot of static. I could here her but not very well. When she had handed me the bluetooth headset I could hear very well but the other person on the other end of the phone line heard the same static I had previously. We are still trying to fix it and might end up sending it back."
2,Piece of junk,"Works as intended, but the volume is absolutely too soft to use in the car/noisy environment. I find myself holding the bluetooth to up the volume, which defeats the purpose of a headset in general.I'd advise going with something in-ear."
4,works fine.,"It works. took me a little bit to figure out how to fit it on my ear, but once I got that down, no problem. =-)"
2,Distortion,I have recently purchased this item and mine is exactly like the picture h500.I also have the problem of I can hear everyone fine and they hear a terrible distortion.I was looking for ways to correct the problem online when I came across these comments =)
1,pece of carp,I would have liked to have knowen that the blue tooth motorola h500 was Peace of carp and didnt work for carp befor I bought it I found that the prices on Amz. are inflated I was looking at grills and seen A Charcoal grill for $135.00 I found the same Grill at our local store for $ 24.99 so I dont trust Amz. anylonger
3,Not too impressed,"It is a good blue tooth, but I can't say that I am overly impressed. It sits on the outside of your ear, not too firmly. Therefore while driving, and turn your head quickly, it shakes itself loose and is annoying. The range is not too good as well. I get alot of interference when my cellphone is in its holster on my belt. I usually have to bring the phone closer to the headset to get good reception. I also tried using it as a earphone for an mp3 player/PDA I have. The sound quality is not good enough to listen to music. Otherwise, it is OK. I had a moto bluetooth I bought a few years ago, and I am just disapointed that its performance has not chnaged much."
3,kinda hard to hear,"I received the product a few weeks ago, I immediately realized that it was not going to sit well on my ear and ever since then I have had trouble hearing from it. I have to consistently push the bluetooth headset towards my ear to hear better. I should have gotten the plantronics!"
2,Very comfortable and easy to use. Outgoing sound is horrible in the car,"This headset seems to be the ""preferred"" headset of my friends. However, whenever I'm not in a dead-still silent room, people have told me that I'm completely unrecognizable. This is especially the case when I'm in my car. Granted, I drive an Acura RSX, which is not known for its quiet ride, but nevertheless, I need something better. I tested it out once, listening to messages that I left on other people's voicemails, and it sounds like I was in an underground cellar surrounded by lead.So if you're going to be using this *only* *only* while in a dead silent room, this is the way to go for ease of use.If you're going to use it any other way, try something better. I still am personally researching what a good headset would be. I may try the plantronics 510 or another more expensive plantronics. I hear that the Jawbone sounds good but is very poorly constructed."
1,Don't bother - go to the store,"I got this from a company called Globalizer. Out of the package i was able to charge it and pair it with my phone. But the sound quality was poor and the device did not work as well as the one i got from the Verizon store (and ran through the washing machine). For example, it would not pickup phone calls or disconnect them using the headset button - had to open the phone for those operations.The company allowed me only to return the device (at my expense) for a replacement. The sound quality of the replacement is better, but it still will not pickup or disconnect using the headset button. I also have difficulty getting starting and ending the bluetooth connection.My advice it to purchase this unit at a store where you can easily return it, rather than buying online."
2,not as i expected,"i ordered this product expecting a new one(as mentioned), but instead i received a used product, with a flimsy packing. they did not even send me a sales receipt.this product looks like a refurbished one, which was not mentioned intially.otherwise it works ok."
2,Bluetooth review,There is a lot of background noise. The person on the other end has a hard time hearing what I'm saying.
2,"Works OK, but won't fit right for me.","This bluetooth worked OK for me but it just wouldn't fit right for me. It had a very, loose fit, so I exchanged it for the Motorola H700 which is smaller and fits much better."
1,Look elsewhere,"Both my wife and I own these, and we are both annoyed enough with them that I went out and bought her an old-school, wired headset the other day to replace hers. I dropped mine about a week in from four feet up onto pavement, and the ear-clip chipped, making it fall out from time to time - definitely not rugged construction. This unit picks up all kinds of background noise and garbles the voice so that you have to shout slowly to be understood at all. In addition, about 60% of the time, when placing a call, you will be able to hear the person you called, but they will not be able to hear you at all, and you'll have to redial to get through."
5,Simply A Terrific Film!,"I can watch this movie over and over again. Brilliant performances by all in both the primary and secondary roles. The type of movie where each time you watch, you pick up something new. I think that part of the appeal of the movie is that we can all identify with each of the three lead characters in some way. If I had to take just five movies with me to the proverbial desert island, this would surely be one of them."
4,Intellegent and Clever Comedy!,"This is a great behind-the-scenes inside-look at the news, and a great character study. Great performances by the three leads, Holly Hunter is as great as always, William Hurt brings warmth and intelligence to an other-wise hollow character and Albert Brooks gives one of the best and funniest performances of the 80's. James L. Brooks wrote an extremely clever screenplay with nicely-drawn characters. Inmensely entertaining and funny, while not a laugh-out-loud comedy, it has drama and a bit of romance. Great stuff. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
3,Good movie,"Good movie, an old story and plot with some freshness. Good screenplay and good acting making this an enjoyable movie"
3,"Good, not great","All the actors do a fine job in this romantic triangle movie, especially Holly Hunter. I like the way the film focuses on its characters (a rare thing in this day and age of special effects) and tries to make each one of them three dimensional. Unfortunately, I never cared much for either of the lead male characters - I didn't like Albert Brooks's character as much as I was supposed to and I didn't dislike William Hurt all that much as the villain either. There are few real laughs here, except for the scene of Brooks delivering a newscast while sweating. I felt that the theme about the vapidization of television news could have been made more of, both for comic effect and for biting criticism. Visually, the film is uninteresting, and its ending is inconclusive. In short I found the whole thing decent but ultimately forgettable."
4,good news,"biting satire with the cast used very well - Williams Hurt and Albert Brooks are perfect in roles that seem written for them, and Holly Hunter is just priceless; it covers journalistic ethics, the burdens of workaholic single women and office politics, with enough time for a love triangle (the weakest part of the movie). more than a decade later, it seems prophetic, what with all those horrible newsmagazines around. if you hate Dateline, this movie is a must!"
3,Pretty much old news,"I suppose Broadcast News merits this deluxe treatment as much as any Michael Bay movie, but it is a far cry from the classicNetwork(1976), which was a much more defining movie in its day. So, it perplexes me that Criterion would choose to single this movie out. Brooks is great in creating sitcoms, but this movie reads as little more than an updated version ofThe Mary Tyler Moore Showwith Bill Hurt as a more sophisticated Ted Baxter.Sure, Holly Hunter is fun to watch and Albert Brooks provides the cynical view one has come to expect from any veteran news reporter, but this movie is pretty much your standard melodrama with Hunter falling in love with Hurt only to find out what a callow person he is, and Brooks, like Murray Slaughter, there to pick her back up again. This movie comes across as little more than a pilot for a new television series."
1,Broadcast News with William Hurt,The CD doesn't play at all. I plan to send it back. I simply haven't had the time yet.
5,A Fast Paced Delight!!!!,"For reasons I can't explain, this book sat in my drawer unread for months...I came upon it and decided to glance over it real quick to see if I was in the mood to read it...I did't stand a chance of putting it down once I began..What a charmer!!! I adored this story!!! Eric was so sexy, sensitive and amusing..I loved listening to him trying to talk himself out of his feelings...and when he leaned in and told Samantha that she smelled like porridge ..I almost died!!! Speaking of Samantha...she was wonderful..I really liked that she was just a normal girl, with secret passions just like the rest of us...I loved this book..the plot and the characters within it are extremely lovable, and the ending leaves you feeling immensely satisfied...I recommend giving it a try...you won't be sorry."
4,The Review,"This book was really amazing and didn't make you think that you were reading some book about this really beautiful girl who always gets the guy. There was a lot of conflict in this book but turned out to make it more exciting. There was one very sexual chapter which may not be sutible for young teens who can't handle it maturely. I was actually not prepared for it becuase I did think it was a young adult book but realized when I reached talk of it that it wasn't, though I feel anyone who is mature can handle it. I became worried at the thought of The Bride Thief getting caught because I felt his cause for doing what he did was very relevent and very heroic. To tell the truth I fell in love Eric as the story continued. I suggest this book for all."
3,Standard Regency Fare,"This was a book with an interesting plot, but the writing and characters are nothing to rave about. If you want a satisfying Regency read, then this is for you. However, for those who prefer better literature, this may not be the one."
4,An enjoyable book !,"I deeply enjoyed Jacquie D'Alessandro's previous books and looked forward to reading ""The Bride Thief"" as soon as it was released. While this book lacks the rolicking humor in her previous books, it's still a light and enjoyable read. The story is told well, and I appreciated the premise of the book...a handsome stranger whisks off unwilling brides before they must make unhappy marriages.That said, I did find Eric Landsdowne to be a character of contrasts. He seems very much the ""love them and leave them"" rake, and yet, he rescues young women from desperate fates. The main character of Samantha Briggeham is delightful. It's nice to know that an intelligent woman *can* get Prince Charming in the end !I do recommend this book, but I would recommend previous titles by the same author above this one. If you are already a Jacquie D'Alessandro fan, I am sure you will have fun as you read."
4,THE BRIDE THIEF WILL STEAL YOUR HEART AWAY!,"Few romance writer can be as consistent as Jacquie D' Alessandro since her buoyant debut Red Roses Means Love and the utterly charming Whirlwind Wedding. Refreshingly original too, judging by her latest romantic romp about a bride brigand...The Bride Thief is again a delightful charade by D' Alessandro with her sensitive characters who are both quirky and tender. Laced with sparkling humour and backed by endearing sub-characters like Sammie's sister and the nascent romance between the magistrate and Margaret, The Bride Thief is joyously fun and unfetteringly romantic. Even though the ending is a bit rushed and Sammie's rejection is inexplicable, The Bride Thief will steal your heart away with its riotous cast and old-fashioned comedy. Jacquie D' Alessandro again shines with her empathy for her characters and sharp wits in this triumphant outing."
5,"Rusty, a Cocker Spaniel","Exactly as described and shipped quickly. I purchased this book because it was the first one I read as a young girl that brought me to tears. I remembered, after all these years, the page that brought such deep emotion to the surface and found it immediately when this book arrived. Great seller. No issues."
2,Scooby Snax,"Do you want Scooby Snacks?This is that type of album. You can get this album by visting one of many 'nappy sitez""L8R"
2,"Big, Tipsy, but Okay... I guess","This toy is Big!! However, it is tipsy and weak. Because it's portable, everything is velcro! It kept falling over my playful daughter! It was more of an annoyance than fun... Makes a fun hiding place and good for peek-a-boo, but not the greatest toy you'll ever buy."
4,pretty cool,got this for my boyfriend and he liked it. A little hard to use on yourself but feels great!
5,Best Lyrical Album Of All-Time,"I urge any fan of hip-hop to listen to this album if you have not heard it already. It is easily the best lyrical album of all-time. Illmatic, Resurrection, ATLiens, and Reasonable Doubt are all lyrical masterpieces, but I think that the lyrics on Soul On Ice surpass all of those albums. The Nature Of The Threat is worth the price of the album alone. This song, accurate or not, remains one of the most controversial songs of all time. Other highlights of the album include Reelishymn, Etc., Miami Life, Ordo Archaos, Sonset and The Evil That Men Do. All of the songs on the album are gems, even if only for the lyrics alone. This album is about six years old and it is still better than 95% of the material that is being released today. If you haven't heard Soul On Ice, you haven't experienced lyricism being taken to new heights."
5,THE WATER ON MY KNEE WILL QUINCH YA THIRST!,"I know Ras, but not until after this album. This cat is the DOPEST LEFT COAST ARTIST OF OUR TIME.Carson might as well be in the east but like he said just becuz you were born where rap originated doesnt make you automatically the SH**. I had all 3 solo releases but I got GOT for VAN GOUGH. Alchemist sold him out when he gave jadakiss the beat for ""we gon' make it"" but still that beat is ill. Ras was released from jail on the 21st of this month and I know he is refocused to knock it out the park. P.S. don't drink and drive...and get caught. 1"
5,Ras-Kass,This album is untouchable it is so far out of the norm I can't start to say anything so all I will say is if you get a copy of this album burn it and put the thing in a safe place.
4,"A definie purchase, for true underground hip-hop fans.","Despite the demonic, but dope beginning with ""On Earth as It Is"", the Californian shows brilliant lyrical composition. Ras Kass also provides smooth, laid-back sounds on tracks such as ""Anything Goes"", ""Reelishymn (pronounced realism)"", and ""Marinating"". In addition, Ras Kass brings intensity and controversy with ""Nature of the Threat"", ""Soul on Ice"", and ""Ordro Abchao (Order out of Chaos)"". Not to mention the brief but hype melody of ""Etc."", however the album does have a couple of soft spots, tracks such as ""Drama (featuring Coolio)"" and ""The Evil That Men Do"" do not have the catching beats of the rest of the album. The 'sleeper' track of the album may be ""Miami Life"". Ras Kass cements the LP with the male/female dedication ""If/Then"". Overall this is one of the most 'slept on' albums in hip hop today."
5,real rapper,"A real hip hop rapper from the west who is deep and very skillful with lyrics. The production is excellent and suits the rhymes, I think they were meant to be deep grumbling basslines. But the flows and lyrics have had a lot put into them and thats what makes this tight. His album after this was not that good, but he still has this to show. You have to listen to this properly because he puts a lot of things into his lyrics and you will catch them the second time around if you miss them. He is a true lyricist and should be in anyone who says they like true 'hip hop's'(not rap, I know what them people want, Fake simple minded bulls#it, not this!) collection. Tight, tight, tight classic and can't be missed. You got to support Ras to the max because he deserves it and we need him. Don't sleep, be smart like these people here and get it, you won't be dissaponted. Peace!"
2,Work Indeed,"Not one of Timothy's strongest books. There's a lot of material in Spadework with several little stories being carried through. But I got the sense that some of the more interesting ones were left underdeveloped. As the book finished, plot lines were wound up too quickly is if to make way for the six o'clock news. A slight disappointment but an engrossing backstage peak at the theatre scene."
2,The novel he was meant to write? I hope not...,"Though renowned as one of Canada's best, with a wealth of great work behind, Findley's latest is not even a shadow of what we have come to expect. While the establishment of setting gives a stunning portrayal of life in Stratford, Ontario, one must wonder why such attention wasn't also given to the book's characters. Jane is a melodramatic Southern Belle turned Canadian, ruined by an overbearing mother and full of woe. Her ambitious husband Griff is unconvincingly pulled into an affair that challenges his sexuality and their 7 year old son offer's 70 year old wisdom in the midst of this household drama.Vaguely interesting and occasionally humorous, Spadework is the book for those interested in loose plots and happy endings."
3,Best (Only!) Comedy/Bluegrass Album Ever,"Twenty-five years after this was first released in 1981, THE STEVE MARTIN BROTHERS is still the best half comedy/half bluegrass album ever recorded. Okay, it's also the only one. And truth to tell, it hasn't aged well. The comedy routines are from a Las Vegas show at the Riviera (best bit--""What I Believe"") and a Hollywood performance at The Comedy Store (best bit--""Love God"").The only real reason to buy this album is for the traditional bluegrass music. Martin obviously has a sincere appreciation for the genre and works with first-class musicians like John McEuen (of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), fiddler Vassar Clements and bassist Roy ""Junior"" Huskey. Some of the the tunes are traditional (""Sally Goodin',"" ""John Henry"" and ""Waterbound,"" the latter is the only vocal), but the rest of the tracks are Martin originals.Bottom line? Two stars for the comedy; four stars for the music. This one is for completists only."
4,The Steve Martin Brothers for Banjo Players,"I've always loved and appreciated Steve's brand of humor and his old comedy stand-up routines. All that said, however, the comedy ""side"" of the CD is a bit tired and I would be hard-pressed to recommend this CD on its comedy merits alone. As a five-string, bluegrass-style banjo picker, however, I have to recommend this CD very highly. There's some really great banjo music contained here, and many arrangements are Steve originals (e.g., Hoedown At Alice's'; Pitkin County Turnaround; Saga of the Old West; and Banana Banjo); all terrific songs in their own right. Steve's a very talented guy, and it's been long in coming that the banjo-playing side of this force of nature is now preserved on CD for banjo pickers to learn from and enjoy."
3,"Not his best comedy, but if you want a complete collection...","The comedy here is stale, and some of the worst Steve Martin comedy ever put down on tape. The bluegrass is fantastic, almost as good today as he has on his album ""The Crow"". Although I am restating previous reviews, if you want his comedy, the other albums are a better bet."
3,The Steve Martin Brothers,"Yes, I know - the members of Monty Python think Steve Martin is the greatest thing since... well, since Monty Python. Personally, I've always thought he was rather overrated as a comic. But he does have his moments - as long as he stays away from some of the more sophomoric material (e.g., ""A Scientific Question"").(As an aside, on ""Make The Rent"" he talks about doing stand-up to pay the rent - for the next 25 years. This album was originally released in 1981, and 1981 plus 25 years equals... well, you figure it out.)However, the musical part of this disc is a real surprise. For a supposedly self-taught banjo player, he has a lot of musical talent - both as musician and composer. The music far outshines the comedy, and alone is worth the price of the CD."
5,Flowers & Fruits,This is an excellent printing of just what I needed. I use these images for decoupage and they are great!
5,"Black, brown and Beige by Duke Ellington",It is a fabulous disc. Anyone who likes Duke Ellington and or jazz would love to hear it. Brings back the old days. Jazz is certainly a wonderful genre.
1,WAY OVERPRICED,"its a absolutely great book. A friend of mine has it , and the price is imprinted on the cover. $35.99NOT $135.00, or $95.00 ""on sale"" YOUR BETTER OFF GETTING IT AT YOU LOCAL BOOKSTORE!!!!!!"
3,fixed the leak!,"Easy to install and fit nicely into my wood stove's gasket slot. More heat, less smoke now. Wife is happy again."
3,"Looks great, but not what i was awaiting...","The rose is very sleek, stylish and eye catching, yet the cane is not as strong. i have it for about 3 weeks and the cane is already bowing... I have a cane that cost me $20 and it's much stronger."
3,Power metal from Australia,"Black Majesty is an Australian band with a style somewhere between power metal and hard rock. They have often been likened to progressive bands like Queensryche and Threshold, and there are certain similarities. Their sound features dual guitars, heavy bass lines and double-time drums, with occasional keyboards and acoustic passages. The vocals, in the mid-to-high range, are smooth and tasteful. This band's songwriting is fairly good. The most serious problem is that many of the songs sound very similar, perhaps a bit too formulaic. The best track here is a cover of Deep Purple's ""Soldier of Fortune"", in which the band demonstrates that they can play outside their usual style."
4,"Great music, they just keep getting better","I was first introduced to Mistle Thrush when I started college, in 1995. I have really enjoyed all of their releases so far, beginning with Silt that year. I love this album, it has one of my favorite songs - Escapades in Glass. I have yet to hear their new one, Drunk with You--but I'm sure it will be great too. I actually went to see them play last night at NYC's Luna Lounge, and was throughly impressed once again. An added plus is that they are super-nice, down to earth people you'd like to meet."
5,I may be prejudiced...,"because I was actually at that show (I think you can hear me cough in the background at one point--uncredited!) and the show was one of the best I've ever seen... extremely intimate, extremely rewarding. It was just Cindy with her guitar(no Microphone!) and her Cellist, Rennata. You get great songs, and some great stories to go along with them. Definitely worth a listen."
5,needs to be watched,"It taugh men not to abuse the girls. it was a great story, but sad in a way, but happy in other ways."
5,Excellent book on color for the serious artist,The book is clearly written with many full color examples of color theory application. It is written for the artist who whats to understand the practical side of color theory. The information presented in this book is directly applicable to solving color problems. Mr. Ames focuses on the thre primary colors and how to mix other colors from them.
4,Quality Book,"This is a quality book which is very well made and written. It covers the story of the North African campaigns from the arrival of german forces in 1941 to the final fall of Tunisia in 1943.The book contains sections on the command decisions (from both sides) as to the strategic conduct of the war - descriptions of small units/personal actions - and the battles of course.The book contains many (b&w;)photos and drawings, none which I recall seeing before.Overall I would call this a ""lite"" or coffee table book covering the desert war mostly from the german perspective. This is not a criticism but do not expect to find detailed orders of battle or hard core unit specifications in this book.It is an easy and entertaining read with many insights into the desert war of North Africa."
3,Kuhn faithfully describes the activities in a fresh view.,"Much has been written of this great strategist. Volkmar Kuhn adds a new viewpoint of this leader seen from the subordinates' level. The document is exceptional, large maps, color and many photographs. I am glad I own a copy."
2,photos are disappointing,The photos in this book are disappointing it may be worth reading but photo wise forget it. There are a lot of other books with plenty of great photos of Afrika Korps and Rommel no need to buy this book unless all you are interested in is reading it.
4,very satisfying solo career retrospective,"disc one covers his solo studio output very well with outstanding tracks like Deal, The Wheel, and Loser plus a lot of other tracks from his later albums (the only other solo Garcia album I have is 1970's self titled)The second disc is a wealth of Jerry's solo live tracks dating back to the early seventies all the way to the nineties. BTW my favorite track that I hadn't heard before on here, Chinese Lullaby. There's some great ragtime-era influence on the aformentioned track. this collection is a satisfying listen"
2,Bland Workout,"I think a great spinning workout should consist of a variety of movements. If you've ever been to a high energy spin class, then that's how I prefer to workout. Target Heart Rate Training fails to be inspiring and fun. I rode 20 minutes into the workout before I realized an overwhelming majority of the workout only consisted of flat roads. About 5 minutes towards to end, you do a short standing climb. That's if you can defeat boredom to the end.Also, the music is Christian pop rock. It's tolerable. However, the music levels are way too high. You can barely hear the instructor talk.Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying the DVD unless you can try it beforehand. I was lucky enough to buy the downloadable version for a fraction of the cost although I'm still out of $4.99."
2,"Great sound and flexiblity, but cheap knobs","I've had my GoSpeak for just over a year and I like the compactness of the system, good sound and flexibility in connecting in mics and computer. Recently though the master volume knob has developed a short in it which has made the system unusable. I'm still waiting to hear back from the manufacturer on how to fix this. For a $400+ sound system, I would expect better quality than a flimsy master volume knob that has shorted out. I'll update if I get a resolution from the manufacturer."
3,Basic,This book was very basic. I think the average good parent has thought of these suggestions already. Some more creative and innovative suggestions would be more helpful.
4,Ideal for Teens,"Ideal gift for a teen if the Teen still reads books, forced a niece to read it.Next time would love to be able to give this book electronically."
5,Highly recommend this book!,I think this book is fantastic! Great for teens and parents of teens. My kids' youth group advisors use this book when they decide what they will focus on each week at youth group.
4,Great customer service!!,"After about 3 month of use my PH 55 started to give me a little trouble. I could no longer calibrate the meter. I called Milwaukee and told them what was going on with the meter. After some Q&A they determand that the probe had become clogged with nutrient salts and the probe would have to be replaced. They sent me a new probe free of charge. Also they gave me some tips on how to prevent it from happening again. The people at Milwaukee were frendly and very helpful. If this meter were more expensive I would have only given 3 stars. You get what you pay for, and for the price It's OK!!"
3,Don't buy this book for the plates.,"Text is good and selection of work is nice and broad but the plates are flat, dull and uninspiring. You don't get the Gaugin colors, so a disapointment from that standpoint."
2,Good story line bad production,"This movies story line had so much potential but then the acting an production was so bad I wanted my money back.The story was about this guy from the future. In his time the air is toxic and the birth rate is decreased to almost nothing. He comes back to now to get a clean air sample and he lands at this wedding reception. He is only aloud to stay in the ""now"" for 11 minutes.It is boy meets girl and boy falls head over heals in love. It takes him 3 months to time travel so it takes almost 2 years to see her for a couple of hours.The story line was interesting, but man the filming aweful and the lead actress couldn't act at all. To add insult to injury this chick had an a voice that made me want to put in ear plugs.So needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this movie."
1,What are all these reviewers watching?,"After reading at least 5 reviews on every film I watch, it was a shock to see a movie about concentration camps and a hodgepodge of cities and streets, old propaganda footage, and narration in Italian, German and English. Maybe the time traveler took all those wonderful characters and hid them in a dungeon. Perhaps that is why this whatever it was made me half sick. Maybe it became a masterpiece after 15 minutes, but that is way too long for me."
3,"uhhhhhh, how does it work???","I got this toy in the duel action pack with anakin, and i like anakin much better. I can't figure out how to kick with Obi-Wan! And the Lightsaber is cool, but it doesn't stay in his hand. They could have done better."
3,3rd best Obi Wan Kenobi,This is a pretty good toy as far as durable goes but I would much rather get the Obi Wan Kenobi red leader pilot. If you get this toy you will be bored with it after about a week or two. But if you get the red leader pilot you will like playing with it for the rest of your life (at least you growup). But you are like me you won't get bored for a long time. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Uh, how does this thing work?","It's kind of fun to play with it, BUT HOW DOES IT KICK! Take my advice and get the one with the slashing attack instead."
2,Does This Toy Work?,I don't like it a lot because I can't figure out how it kicks. The directions don't make that much sense.I would like it if I could figure out the directions. I would like this toy if it worked.
3,Be Warned...Only An EP,"So I ordered this disc and I was very excited when it arrived. Until I read the back that says ""TRT: 28 min"" and at the bottom it says, ""Coming Soon: Full-Length Warner Bros. LP The Audience Is Listening"". I mean this is a good disc, but it loses two stars cause there should be something that says it isn't a full album and there is no way they should charge $17.99 for some EP that is only 28 minutes. I think it was very misleading. I wish I would have known I was paying $17.99 for less than 30 minutes of music. If you are a Cut fan I'm sure you will enjoy it and will probably buy it, just be warned.mike"
5,This is the greatest book in the world!,"Graduation of Jake MoonBy Barbara ParkDate published 2000This book is about a little boy who has a mently challenged grandpa.An good part of this book is when this little boy who is walking home from school one day with some friends and he finds his grandpa in the dumpster eating out of it.Then the grandpa yellls out to the boys ""HEY!"".then the boys start to laugh at him except for one little boy who just stands there.People who like true stories would like to read this story because this story is based on a true story.If there were 100 people voteing for two books 80 people would vote for the book The Graduation of Jake Moon."
5,This is a Great Book!,"The graduation of Jake Moon is a great book. Jake, the main character, is an 8th grader who used to have a good relationship with his grandfather. Jake is upset because his grandfather has altzheimers and forgets everything. What will his grandpa do next to embarass him? Read this book and find out?..."
3,A KIDS LIFE,The Graduition of Jake Moon is a good book for all ages.When you start reading it you won't want to put it down and stop readig it.The book is about a kid's gradfather that has a disability.You must read the book to find what his disability is with his grandfather.
4,The Graduation of Jake Moon,This story takes place in eight grade in P.U University. This boy is going to grauduat from Middle School to High School.

3,hamster bar,"We give our hamster a chunk of this every once in a while. It will eat it over time.I thought it might go nuts over it, but it just eats it like it's regular food.It's messy to cut as a bunch of little seeds go flying everywhere.Smaller, more hamster portion sized treats might be better."
5,Kurupt And Daz Produce A Timeless Classic.,"This is the best rap album released in a long time. It was recorded in 1995, and I know that seems really recent, but you'd be surprised by how much the hip-hop ear has changed. This album sounds as new and fresh as ever and just seems to get better everytime I listen to it. ""Dogg Pound Gangstaz"", ""Respect"", ""New York, New York"", ""Smooth"", ""Cyco-Lic-No"", ""Ridin', Slipin', And Slidin'"", ""Let's Play House"", ""A Dogg'z Day Afternoon"", ""Reality"", ""So Much Style"", and many more are all awesome on this set. I recommend this album to any hip-hop fan, because it will satisfy any rap craving, especially if you like G-Funk."
3,I expected much better.,"This is a good album if this is the first Death Row album you have bought but if you have ""Doggystyle"" and ""The Chronic"" then its a big dissapointment."
5,G-funk,"One of the best hip hop CD ever. Daz and Kurupt in their prime. One of Deathrow's finest, hands down!"
3,not that good,"This CD was much lower than my expectations. I had heard the Dogg Pound on the Death Row Greatest Hits album and loved them but Dogg Food was pretty weak. A few of the songs are ok, but many have bad beats and not too strong lyrics. The CD's alright but way lower than my expectations."
5,The best in the game.,"Kurupt and Daz, the two members of Tha Dogg Pound, create an incredible album. All the tracks are just the greatest, the lyrics are insightful, the guests were very good, everything was great. Kurupt did one hell of a job on the album. This album is a classic, plain and simple. If you listen to it, you'll get hooked for sure."
4,yo yo daz ang kurupt r tight on this one,"If u r a fan of nate dogg,snoop dogg, warren g u should cop this album. I recently aquired this album like 3 days ago and it has not been out of my cd player. The strongest tracks r Dogg pound Gangstaz, smooth and ridin slippin and sliding. This album starts off strong and it gets a little weak at the end but it is still definetly worth checking out. Check out other great mc like bily guliman(strongest effort is classic christmas) and check out the kurupt solo albums. I should take off a star or 2 for the week album cover but i am feeling nice today."
5,The illmatic of GANGSTA RECORDS,"The album is straight raw. Kurupt's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with Daz's Delivery. The G-Funk beats are the best they've ever sounded. As a whole, you will not skip one song at all. A++"
4,"Great album, NOT CLASSIC though...","To keep it simple, this album has a great bunch of amazing songs like Dogg Pound Gangstas, New York, Smooth, Respect, Let's play house, I dont like to dream, and some...now, to even the score, this album has some songs i can barely hear like Big Pimping2 (Why did put someone to talk over this classic beat, so annoying), and bomb ass pussy that gets very repetitive, also the last 4 songs are decent at its best. So this is a great album to have, but definitely not classic like some reviewers said."
2,Not what i was expecting from tha dogg pound,"The Dogg Food album doesnt compare with their earlier songs on Death Row. Kurupt doesnt rap as well as he used to and the G-funk isnt as good as I was expecting. The only good songs are Dogg Pound Gangstaz, Respect, A Doggz Day Afternoon. The rest all sound wak and dont suit Kurupts styles."
5,4.5 STARS -- WEST-COAST CLASSIC,"This album is very underrated. My favourite tracks are: ""Dogg Pound Gangstaz"", ""Respect"", ""New York, New York"", ""Smooth"", ""Cyco-Lic-No (B***h A** N***az)"", ""Let's Play House"", ""I Don't Like To Dream About Gettin' Paid"", ""Do What I Feel"", ""Some Bomb A** P***y"" & ""Soo Much Style"".DPGHIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Essential classic by the best rap duo ever,"I am a huge Dogg Pound fan and love this album. Kurupt's rapping is amazing and he makes this album a classic. Daz, however, has improved so much since this album was made, both as an MC and as a producer. The new DPG album, Dillinger and Young Gotti, is far better than Dogg Food. The major features that prevents this album from earning a five star rating are the stupid W-Balls interludes. They're not funny, they are just annoying. Even so, this is an essential album by the best rap duo ever."
5,A great album!!,Dogg Food is intense. The songs keep you listenin until they are over but then they're stuck in your head forever. I can't wait for West Coast Aftershock!
5,Dogg Food,This is an awesome cd a real must have i like the dogg pound this cd has some awesome beats. go cop that
3,I just don't get what's so great about this album,"I have now listened to this album 3 times, and I will admit, it is a fair release, but nothing like I had heard it would be. The album is WAY too long and is hard to sit through since about half of the tracks are bad, but because there are so many tracks, about 4 or 5 are good, 2 of those are classics (""New York, New York"" and ""Let's Play House""). In my opinion, 2002 is a much better release and well worth the money. Pick this up if (for some strange reason) you are in dire need to hear more from the Dogg Pound after hearing all of their other stuff, but for new listeners of the Dogg Pound, 2002 would be better."
1,LOCK UP THA DOGGS BECAUSE THE'RE WHACK!!!!!,"ALL I have to say is THIS ALBUM STINKS. THE Tracks are weak,the lyrics are bootie,netheir daz or kurupt can rap.they are just as bad as warren g,and the rest of those sorry Long beach rappers.they gets NOOO play in my ride."
2,Brings back sad memories,"When I was in middle school, every ignorant fool in that school had this album (this and ""All Eyez On Me""). It was like their Bible or something. They would go through the halls (during class time, I might add) and recite its lyrics like it was there personal mantra. All of the wannabe thugs and trying-so-hard-to-be-down-but-can't gangstas bought this album without reservation. I'm a senior now, and it's sad to see that this music has negatively influenced a generation of youth at Henry Clay Middle School in Los Angeles, California. All we can do now is imagine what could have become of these wayward youth if it were not for the destructiveness of this album..."
5,Wow...,"Yesterday while wandering trough my favorite little used book store on main st, I stumbled across this book, ""We Won Today."" And wow! This book is incredible. You go girl!"
1,awful!,"these gloves are very thin but more importantly, they become sticky--I mean the latex sticks to itself! If used for cooking or cleaning the gloves just deteriorate into a sticky mess. I'm going to see if I can return these terrible things. hope so."
4,good and bad,This card kicks but with SolidWorks but the DirectX support is not complete even though it's suposed to be. I tried several drivers with no sucess. ATI's tech support doesn't have much to offer on the issue either.
1,I would not recommend,"I purchased this carafe because of the capacity. It was supposed to keep hot beverages hot for up to 10 hours, especially if ""pre-heated"" with hot water for 5 minutes before filling with coffee. Well, after about two hours, the coffee was at room temp and only drinkable if reheated in the microwave. Not worth it at any price."
5,WHOA,"Fantastic CD, this is flamenco puro of the highest level. Caracol brings also a fantastic version of ""El Vaquilla"" (much later a big hit of Gypsy Kings), the old voice in ""Zorongo Gitana"", ..."
1,THE ENTIRE SERIES IS NOT WORTH ONE RED CENT!,Way over-hyped in my opinion. Definitely not even worth a rental.
1,Rip Off,totally disappointed..whole series is a joke...should be call Guys Act Stupid...amature editing and directing..
3,Taunting,Too much talking from the moderator.......more time needs to be dedicated to the REASON why anyone would want to order this CD in the first place.For the price.......it's worth the purchase.
4,A must for any ILLY COLLECTION fan.,"Illy to some is the best coffee in the world, I can't say that since I have not tasted them all but I do love Illy, especially their espresso pods, but Illy is more than just coffee, they represent the most advanced and yet the most simple of pleasures... and their cup embodies that. This book is all about that, It covers the creation and a good decade's worth of artisitic varatations on the Illy cup.I have been bitten by the Illy Collection bug and own a few of the sets, it's nice to have this book as a guide to the ""expensive"" past. The only problem is that the collection is only through 2003, so it is missing the 2004/2005 cups. Espresso has never been so stylish!"
1,Copycat!!,"The song 'cinderella' was actually sung by a Thai singer named TATA YOUNG~!!!!!!! When I saw the clip of this song on Disney channel, I was very disappointed that Disney would do such a thing. TATA is a very talented Asian singer. I am Thai~!!! So when I saw this, it was very frusrtating. Just because TATA is famous in Asia and her songs are mostly heard in Asia does not mean Disney can just remake it for North America!!"
2,eeeew,"i gave it 2 stars because cinderella is a song and all the girls can sing good, even though it sounds computerized at osme points"
2,A Waste of My Money,"Well, truthfully, my daughter liked the tracks. HOWEVER, the tracks are basically the same as for the Cheetah Girls karaoke disc that I also bought, and I was unable to determine that at the time of purchase. This disc does contain two more tracks, but these are remixes of two of the other tracks--not worth much. Also, the sleeve says something about a computer program on the disk. On my Macintosh, all the program did was direct the user to the Disney website--a valueless item in my view. There was no indication the program would do anything different on a PC."
3,"A romance, not a real western?",In Arizona in the Prohibition days a cowboy meets a beautiful married womanand her liquor running husband. There are cars and reservation Indians in this novel. About the only thing that qualifies this as a western is that Zane Grey wrote it and where it is set. It gushes femininity like a Jane Austin novel... For all that it is well written and not really an unpleasant read. At the beginning there is a very good description of a snake dance.
5,Loma Linda Big Franks,"Loma Linda Big Franks are a great food to have on hand. Not only are they delicious, they are easy to prepare. All of my family loves big franks! Also - They store easily and keep well."
5,"The first, the best",These are the best veggie dogs. Don't be put off by the can. They cook evenly and well. Totally delicious. Glad to find them on amazon!!
3,Not the best,"The franks aren't the best substitute for hotdogs. I didn't like them much and neither did any of the people in my house. Before getting these I would highly recommend Smart Dogs, they have a much better texture and cook up a lot better. The outer layer is a little tougher than regular hot dogs. The best are Tofurkey sausages though. They are much larger than hot dogs, but have a great taste and texture.Don"
3,Worthington Vegn Franks.,"Worthington Loma Linda Big Franks (vegan) are a product of Morningstar Farms, which also market many vegetarian items in their familiar green packaging. I ordered a case of Worthington Loma Linda Big Franks because I could no longer find Morningstar veggie hot dogs in the grocery store. Although the Loma Linda Big Franks are good, I don't find them to be nearly as good as the Morningstar veggie dogs."
4,Delicious!,"I was in Orlando and came across a vegan hotdog stand. Vegan Chili, caramelized onions, relish on a whole wheat bun. But the star of the dish was the hotdog. Had to creen my neck to see the brand of dog. I was surprised to see the can of of hotdogs packed Vienna sausage-style. Best veggie dog I've ever had. Big Frank's was the brand. Get them. Eat them. Thank me."
5,Great Price!,"I have enjoyed Big Franks for years. Now that Amazon carries them I can get them delivered to my door at a price (including shipping, subscription plan) that is lower than I can find anywhere else."
5,Best veggie dogs,"These are my favorite veggie dogs, tender and tasty. Morningstar frozen ones are terrible. I see they're back! Another way to prepare: Mash one up with mayonnaise and eat like tuna salad. They're precooked. Try it, you'll like it.Order now if they're available; they go in and out of stock."
2,"Edible, but not even close to all the hype","These canned hot dogs are not what they are hyped up to be. After reading all of the 5 star reviews my hubby and I had to try them. I was nervous to buy a full case off of Amazon so I picked up a couple from a safeway grocery store (the other was the Little Links... completely gross!) for about $9 a can.We grilled them, with great success! We used a little cooking oil spray and there was no sticking and they held together nicely. I put mine on a toasted bun with ketchup and relish. The dog was mushy and not much flavor. It wasn't THE worst veggie dog but NOT even close to greatest. They are not worth the price. Morningstar veggie dogs are the best, these don't even compare except that they are hot dog shaped.If I were building a bomb shelter and wanted veggie dogs in my canned food stash, these would be go to choice. Otherwise, save your money, try a can from the store before getting a giant amount here."
3,Good and tasy product - but price is lot higher now.,"My 2 stars are not for the product as such. The hot dogs are very good and offer an excellent alternative. However, I don't buy these from Amazon anymore as the price has increased dramatically over the last year or so. I used to get these for around $45 with subscriptions and the same price is now around $65. I can find cheaper then that from a local store."
3,Better,"Loma Linda Big Franks, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)This is much beetter: sodium content is 9%; and cholesterol is 0 (zero),(nada).I'll order next time.Jim"
3,Cans were all banged up and dented,"The worse was that over half of the cans had significant dents and were all banged up and crushed.I like the tofurkey Italian style sausages but was looking for a smaller veggie dog with a less exaggerated amount of protein. These have a better nutritional profile (we can only absorb so much protein per meal, the rest is wasted and stresses the kidneys) and they do taste a little like the little canned Vienna wienies that we used to get as kids. I do not like them as well as the italian style tofurky taste wise, so it is too bad that I have 12 cans of them! However, I think I can eat them as regular hot dogs, maybe with some grilled onions, or something spicy. I wish I had been able to taste just one can, but they are not available anywhere where I live. I do like the fact they do not take space in the freezer."
1,update the cans!!,"They still taste good, But the cans are so outdated I'll never buy again until they update the cans!! most of them came here bent up And you can't get into them!!!"
5,Great Blend of Traditional and Contemporary Music!,"Acoustic guitar, bull roarer, didgeridoo...PLUS Michael Searching Bear on the Native American Flute??!!! Heck, I would have just taken Michael on the flute and Windwalker on the vocals and gladly forked over the dough...but you throw in those other wonderful (and amazingly complementary) instruments as well, done with grace and aplomb, and you've got a one-of-a-kind blend of contemporary and traditional sounds. Didn't think he could outdo his previous release ""Voice Within"". I was wrong!! Tom Kerr - Executive Director, Kulture Kids [...]"
5,Great for the price,"Great price,fast shiping and very good quality.Note:*Replacement battery, not the original one."
5,8125 battery,What can you say about a battery. It's a battery - It was new - It worked - It was just what I ordered - the price was great with free shipping. All good
1,HTC OEM Cingular 8125 Standard Batteries,It was representated that these batteries provided an OEM replacement for the standard battery in the Cingular 8125 (HTC) smartphone. My experience has been that these two (2) batteries I purchased provide far less battery life than the four (4) year old battery that I was trying to replace.I have continued to seek a battery with better service life.
1,Doesn't fit is the first problem,"Bought this as a replacement for our Cingular 8125 -- the original Sony is no longer available. When installed, the back cover had to be forced on, indicating the size was not the same as before. Then the real problem began -- programs were slow to open, even slower to respond. Vendor was easy to work with, but at the original price, returning was not cost effective. Oh, well. Better luck next time."
1,8125 battery,"The battery is in good condition. The company that sent it, however displayed no interest in trying to get it to me. Shipping took OVER a month (twice the amount of time promised) and they didn't bother to track the item, so i had to just hope it got here. I contacted them several times before I received the battery and after it should of been delivered. Eforcity offered absolutely no help whatsoever in refunding my money or trying to fix the problem. I'm glad I got the battery but will NEVER buy from Eforcity again."
5,NICE!!!,"Very good product, fast shipping, and most of all AFFORDABLE!!!! iwent to a ATT&Cingular they told me that these batterys range up to $50. anywho... My 8125 works flawlessly thanks a bunch!"
5,great price and works ;-),"this is the 2nd one I've purchased for our 8125's so far, the first one was over 1.5 yrs ago and is still working..."
5,Great item and seller,Worked great on phone and is reliable. The seller I used had it out to me in minutes it seemed (really a couple of days)
1,Exreme low quality!,"The quality is Very Low!!!! I should realize, pay les, have low quality! That is the story with NO NAME products! I did the entire process to format them (three 8 hour charging cycles) but they have power only for 20 to 24 hours, even in Stand By mode. The original battery last 4-5 days in the beginning and now around 25 hours, that was the reason for which I bought new ones! My wish was to buy well know brand (the original brad is SONY) but unfortunatelly I didn't find one!Better pay more for a ""brand"" product - if you find one!"
5,Good stuff!,"I bought the battery and the shipment was quicker than expected. As far as quality ""so far, so good"""
5,"Get down girl, go head get down","Dagggg, B. Mama ain't no joke. I know most people probably hate B. Mama, but I sorta kinda liked her strong character. I know she evil, but she bad. I like the way Cheryl stood up to her though and Brenda and Ariel was too doggone whimpish for me and the men act too soft too. And where in the heck did Kial come from. I think he's like an angel or something, he showed up everywhere. I think Sophie B. did a good job. I enjoyed the book, couldn't put it down. I got in trouble fifty times at work for sneaking down into my cublicle with my face buried into the book. Gone girl, write a sequel. I want to see more of B.Mama oh crazy behind."
3,"Works as advertised, but a bit bulky!","Product works fine. Little disapointed in its bulk. 8mm cable is a bit big! Work with 5mm cable locks alot at work. Please be aware that the number wheels are numbered only 1 to 7! It's not even the octal number system, missing the zero! Regardless, it's a keeper, it does indeed work fine."
4,Bliss,"I have only one problem with this album: poor production/mixing.The vocals are too low in the mix, sometimes (i.e the verses of `Hills...') totally inaudible. A near-tragedy, given the sheer gorgeousness of Monica Richards's voice...and the music in general. Even with the sound problem, this is not only the first masterpiece of her career, but one of the best (yes, you read that right) alternative rock albums of the '90s. Track-by-track dissection seems improper - words can't convey the net impact of those marvellous harmonic twists, haunting guitar lines and Monica's crystalline vocals, but I must draw attention to `Solar Friend' (which includes a vocal hook Monica would put to even better use in a certain Faith & The Muse song in '96), `Alekan Girl' (ethereal-romantic) and `Glaciers Down' (sheer overwhelming perfection)."
3,"Though it is a beautiful woman singer, it is ...","As for Las Numero 1 series, sound quality, picture quality are excellent together.I listened to the song of Lucia for the first time, and the impression of her song was not my preference, and probably many people might like her song, and, however, her song did not have many impressive things for me.However, her voice is beautiful, and a figure seems to be a fashion model, too.If better music is offered to her, it will be very different."
2,"Bad music, bad narration!","I am sorry that I purchased this CD. ""Non-thinking"" is something I really try to work on in my own meditations, and I was hoping this CD would work well with my own goals.Unfortunately, the music is very distracting from the meditation. A lot of it consists of zither and harmonica (yes, harmonica) tones zipping up and down the scale at a very rapid pace. It's quite different from what you'd expect on a CD that is meant to relax you!The narrator also has a strong foreign accent. This, too, is distracting from the meaning of the words she is speaking. You end up thinking more about the accent and where she might be from than you do about the content of the meditation itself.I do NOT recommend this CD."
1,"Boring, not realistic","I bought this out of boredom as I like to fish and do not have much time go actually go. When I got it, I played it for a few minutes and was bored with it. It is not very realistic at all.I thought maybe I just did not understand how to play it, so I had a guy friend check it out, even he was disappointed in it.We both agree that there are better one's that you can buy, and one's that are cheaper even that are better."
1,Too complicated,Purchased for a 6 year old boy who loves to fish. Everytime he catches a fish he looses the fish and he gets really frustrated. So I tried it and the same thing happens to me. We don't understand how to set the hook on this game so we never catch any fish which takes all the fun out of the game. Great concept but I would find one that is easier to use.
3,will see when I will give to my father in law,"this is a gilft and I think that he will like it .. the sound is just like ""kitch"" .. but so funny ... and for a man that never touch a pc, this ""high tech"" will be ok ;)"
3,FOSTER MOM FROM HELL,"The usually sweet and kind Angie Harmon pulls a Tallulah Bankhead die die my darling in her role as the titular good mother who is not so good. Harmon chews up the scenery with a tenacity and venom equal to those other madames who've played psychomommies. Seems like everytime she and hubby Joel Gretsch take in a foster child, the child perishes. Seems like Munchhausen's has a new poster mommy. Her latest wards are a teenager (well played by Jordan Hinson) and her little brother. They were left parentless due to an auto accident and family's good friend cop Jason London is forced to place them in foster care. Once the children arrive at their new home, however, they find themselves virtual prisoners under the possessive care of Harmon.There aren't a lot of surprises in this by the book thriller, but Harmon is so delightfully evil she makes it all worthwhile."
2,Should be camp but goes for art,"This type of movie, more often than not, delves into the realm of camp. An over the top character like the mother in this film fits the bill perfectly. One minute sweet as pie, the next minute spitting venom to the enjoyment of all viewers. The problem with this film is that it takes itself far too seriously. There are endless shots of birds flying, sunsets,and exterior shots of the house all for no reason. The film moves at a glacial pace for most of the begining and is hampered by an absolutely ludicrous ending(even by thriller standards). Really only worth a watch for the performance by Angie HArmon."
1,Read a fair amount and quit.,"This selection was not in the genre of normal detective stories and was therefore drawn out and awkward for this American reader. I rarely give up on a book, but this one did me in."
5,A good read on St. Louis history,"Although the title of this book is misleading it is a great source for the colorful history of St. Louis. I was disapointed on how little was dedicated to the ghosts in St. Louis but nonetheless it is very interesting and, in my personal opinion, worth picking up. You will learn a lot."
3,not what it is described,"Troy Taylor is a good writer, both of ghost stories and of history. Unfortunately, this book is listed as ""St louis history and hauntings"", It is actually 75% history, less than 25% hauntings.The history is presented in a lively way, he obviously loves his subject, but the hauntings are miniscule.If you want hauntings, pick up his book ""Bloody Hollywood"", or "" Haunted Graveyards of America"". He does much better in the haunting department in those books. I can also reccommend "" his ""Haunted Chicago"" book, he does much better in that with making the haunting and the history come alive. For this book, just read it for the history"
5,haunted St. Louis,I considered this book to be fascinating. I could not put it down. Lived in St Louis most of my life and learned a good deal of history from reading this. The stories of the haunted areas are interesting. I keep an open mind to the possibilities of the spirit world. I have also read Haunted Alton. I really enjoy this author's approach to haunted history.
4,About Alphabets,I recommend this book for anyone interested of this subject. It is well written and very informative. I enjoyed reading it and have added it to my reference library.
4,Letters from Lost Thyme,"A fascinating glimpse into the brilliant mind and vast range of knowledge possessed by a man who seemingly lived a simple life as a prep school teacher, but whose understanding of the world and literature and whose philosophy of living is almost beyond comprehension or explanation. An enlightening experience unlike anything I have ever read before."
4,Witty and Entertaining,"I too found fault with Allie's refusal to love Robert for what he presents to her--a noble, caring, and brave man. His ""secret"" was fairly stupid (why didn't he just tell Allie? the ""honor and vow"" excuse didn't really fly) and therefore their ""reasons"" for allowing themselves to separate seemed contrived. However, the dialogue between them was so sparkling and their chemistry so great I ultimately overlooked that.It was also annoying how people kept ""fisting their hands,"" having ""eyebrows that shot upwards,"" and kept ""capturing each other's mouths."" Towards the end, the exact same sentence appeared twice! ""He erased the distance between them with three long strides."" A few pages later, the Evil Villain did the exact same thing! Still, the story was so engaging it really overrode these objections instead of being mired under by them."
2,Yawn...,"It was just boring. It lacked the usual suspense and passion in her other books. Also, nothing romantic really happens until too late. By the time she actually admits her feelings, I was already skimming to the end. Alberta was hard to like. Skip this."
3,Adorable hero...okay story,"Oh goodness...this one was just an okay read for me. I found myself bored several times throughout the book, especially the first half. I also struggled to feel the chemistry between the h/h and the emotion of the story. I loved the humor this author does so well, but the story itself was so predictable and the character musings were quite ""cliche-ish."" Those are the times I found myself bored. There were good parts and bad parts, hence 3 stars."
3,Interesting Read,"After reading the first book in this series, I just had to get the second one. The book was OK but it just did not seem to have the same elements as as the first book in the series. It lacked the suspense and intrigue. I think it is because the villian was revealed by the author way too early in the novel. At times I almost felt bored reading it. And the ending left much to be desired. On the other hand I was happy to read more about Austin and Elizabeth (Whirlwind Wedding)."
2,Arrived with tabs broken,"These arrived each with one of the two plastic tabs broken. I don't have time to exchange them because next week it will be too cold to install. I had to glue the tabs back on, but one broke again while installing. Also, there needs to be a recess for the mounting bolt because it gets in the way of securing speakers to the bracket. I countersunk the hole with a 3/8"" drill bit, but I didn't want to go too far and risk breaking the plastic."
1,Wrong Image -- Wrong Movie Order with Caution,"The description is for a film called ""Before You go"", starring Julie Walters, Joanne Whalley, etc ... Apparently, it has an alternate title, ""Memory of Water"". The image provided, is for a foreign language documentary, whose Spanish(?)title translates into ""Memory of Water"". Because ""Before You go"" is evidently only available in VHS format, I wanted to make sure that I didn't end up receiving the foreign documentary, which involved some gritty/depressing/bleak subject matter having to do with child abuse of some sort...Soooo... I sent an email to the seller to verify which film they were offering. After being assured it was the movie I wanted, I was kind of upset when I received the @#!!&# documentary instead... At the time, I'm not sure whether I notified Amazon or not -- I will send them a copy of this... and after the seller gave me the wrong info, I figured I'd wasted enough time & money on the proposition."
5,The Magnetic Effect,"This book is a must read for everyone. Its just one more way to help take care of our medical needs without doctors, prescribed medicines or surgery. For example, holding the south pole of a magnet ten inches below the neck for ten minutes twice a day will strengthen the heart. In a horseshoe magnet when hung by a string will align itself with the north pole but the pole facing the north is actually the south pole of the magnet. The price of the book is money well spent."
3,Comback album,"I loved the cut ""Lovers Tonight"" as he did on the live ""Mayday"" album. As of recently I found a copy and it's a good, but a short piece. It's not my favorite one of his but give it a listen anyway. This one has more of an 80's sound to it, though it was recorded in 1991. I so don't understand why Elektra only released it in Japan for crying out loud. I would only guess because he sent me a message saying that he sold more albums in Japan, Scandinavia, and Germany than anywhere else. Another result of the music industry turning a blind eye to good and talented musicians. If you can find a copy (this title has been out of print for almost 17 years in America) check it out."
1,The book is about Dependent Development,The book is real silly. The writing style of the author suggests that he really doesn't know what he's talking about. He uses words that unnecesarrily cumbersome. He also uses them out of context. This is my review. A real silly book that is difficult reading.
1,"Works fine, except in the shower","I can tune in radio station on this thing from everywhere in the house, EXCEPT in the shower."
5,Memories Past,These were the candies that I took to the movies because they lasted. Most stores don't have them so I bought bulk. They are just as good today as they were back in my childhood and I don't have to go on a hunt every other week to find them. they actually came a few days earlier than scheduled.
4,Smaller than expected,These are even smaller than the small fireballs we bought at a bulk store. Taste is the same but just a tiny bit bigger than say a gobstopper or small gumball. I didn't know they even came this small.
2,misleading,I love fireballs I ordered these for the price and count that the add stated. Says about 800. Well my bag only had 260 in it. Very Disappointing. Would not recommend
5,Those flames get me higher and higher,"I used to be addicted to Atomic Fireballs when I was 13. I would go to the party store and buy handfuls of them. I would promptly eat 'em all that same day. I'm talking about the jumbo ones, not the smaller ones. These things would burn a ""hole"" in the inside of my cheek/mouth and I'd be on a huge sugar high. These things gave me incredible hyperactive energy with their sugar and red hot cinnamon flavor. Just what you need when you're 13 - more energy! They're not called Atomic Fireballs for nothing.If you're like me and like red hot cinnamon flavored stuff and haven't tried these ever, I highly recommend them. Have plenty of water with you to put out the fire."
2,Not accurate,"In the description it says ""about 800"" Whenever I received mine me and my wife count all of them and we received 383. This isn't even close to 800 unless you break them in half. Going to SAMs club from now on."
2,Only atomic if you DON'T like spicy!,"I thought all fireballs would have the same intensity since they're all made by FP, but these are smaller and NOT spicy enough. They're not BAD, but I like very spicy, very cinnamon-y fireballs & these aren't."
1,saccharine,"The instrumentals on this cd are okay, but the vocals are just sickeningly sweet. I listened to the cd twice because I wanted to like it based on all of the glowing reviews it has gotten. The vocals, especially on Braes O' Strathblane, were so saccharine, I had to turn it off. Throwing in a few scottish pronunciations done in an American accent just made it worse. I regret I wasted my money on this treacle."
1,Yawn!!!,"In Diana Palmers story The Founding Father I made myself finish it. There was no passion (very dull and ugly people).Diana's stories are usually about 2 people who can't keep there hands off one another. These barely kissed, he thought she was plain and did'nt change his mind through out the story. Big John never once came close to losing control, even after they married it was weeks before he touched her, then end of story. If this is going to be Diana's new style of writing I'll pass on buying anymore of her books. So if your expecting hot steamy romance I would pass on this book."
1,what a stinker,"This book was awful, simply awful. I like Diana Palmer, as a rule; in fact that's why I bought the book, to read about The Founding Father of Jacobsville. I wish I hadn't bothered. The wording was clunky and uninspiring, and even the other two stories by different authers weren't that great. My recomendation--don't waste your time. Choose something else."
3,Elk Hunting in the Rocky Mountain West,"I wanted some basic Elk hunting info. This video has some intrest and some good photography but lacked depth in the actual hunt tactics I was looking for. There was a sequence in the video around the camp fire that was a waste of ten minuites of film time. I wasen't interested how the star cut the stock of a rifle down for his son. I didn't spend big for the tape so I guess it was just ""ok"" for the money."
1,Was this a new cartridge?,"I purchased this black ink Brother cartridge on 6/22/06. It is 8/1/06 and with mimimal printing over the last month it is running low. I would be leary about ordering this product from this site. Everything else I have ordered from Amazon has been great, so this was somewhat of a disappointment."
3,"genuine Brother, new ink cartridge","Quality and price - good deal. These are genuine Brother ink carts in original vacuum packaging, not remanufactured. Many ink carts on the web are remanufactured, but the listing does not make it obvious. This price is almost the lowest for new brand-name black, cyan, and yellow (why is magenta price much higher ??). When I tried the least expensive source, they were genuine but outdated or nearly so - probably surplus. These were very fresh, carts dated 2009.05 expiration (purchased 2007.09)"
3,is color used when printing ONLY black text !?!?!,"Is it true that using a Brother MFC-5440CN printer to ONLY print black text emails and word processing documents will also consume the three color ink tanks?It seems to be true because that is the case with a friend's printer: she never printed color and all three color tanks have run dry and, unless the 3 color tanks were replaced, the printer refused to continue printing in simple black."
1,NOT retail packaging,"The ink did NOT come in retail packaging, in a box as shown. It's in some kind of sealed bag, that you might find inside the box of retail packaging. It doesn't say Brother on the bag.The word Brother and the LC41 number only appears on a paper label with a barcode printed on a laser printer, that is applied over another label that says the same thing but adds the word ""new,"" on a laser printed label.Since they lie about what they are selling in the description, I wouldn't suggest buying this product. There's certainly a possibility it will damage your printer. It shouldn't be allowed to be sold that way on Amazon."
1,Misleading Advertizing,"*** NOTHING from Tonerpals is OEM (manufacturer produced) ***On Tonerpals seller info page they declare ""TonerPals is your OEM alternative for all today's top brand names including Canon, HP, Brother, Samsung, Dell, Epson, Lexmark and much more. Our products are manufactured at ISO: 9001 manufacturing facilities and are guaranteed to meet or exceed OEM specifications."" meaning that they may have the ""retail packaging"" as advertized but they ONLY HAVE REFURBISHED/REFILLED TONER!!!If you want and need OEM ink, go elsewhere... if you don't care, either buy here or go elsewhere since you can find non OEM refilled ink cartridges from other sellers for much less, though shipping may negate these savings.And next time, check out the seller before you buy or really, who's to blame here? They are technically delivering what they have stated... ""retail packaging"", nothing more."
1,False Marketing,"See my other review on color cartridges. THis company selling substitute, not Brother cartridges. THis is FALSE marketing plain and simple. My other post did not appear I guess because I used the ""A"" word as in A-M-A-Z-O-N allowing companies like this to sell false products."
1,*NOT* genuine Brother brand ink pictured,"Although the picture is of the Brother ink cartridge, the actual item shipped was a no-name ""compatible"" cartridge. It may work, I don't know, but the marketing is deceptive, and for a copy it's actually overpriced."
4,good product,"As i stated earlier the lc41 ink jet cartridges are a good buy. I installed it in my brother all in one printer, and i started printing right away."
5,Only Brother ink for my printer,"I only use genuine Brother refill cartridges for my printer. I never have to worry about my printer clogging up or what colors I am going to get. The colors run vibrant and true. You should see the color photos. They are difficult to distinguish from those that come from Snapfish. My in-laws are amazed that my photos were not professionally developed. Other printed materials, like cards and documents, are sharp.I have tried other inks in my printer before and nearly ruined my printer when it started clogging up. The colors were also off. No more. Only the best for my printer._______________UPDATE: Only regular yield black ink works in my MFC-420CN. The high yield cartridge doesn't fit."
4,old but good,helloa very good book on subjectold but goodthe descriptions have been well detailedabsolutly to read it and discover it to discover itregards
1,How about a full disclosure that use is limited to specific umbrella?,"It looks like it is probably a pretty good net, however it us made for a specific (presumably Ace) offset umbrella. I assumed it was designed to just toss over the umbrella (I haven't yet decided what that assumption makes me). However, that is not the case -- the net has Velcro all along the top to be attached to the Velcro already present along the outside edges of the (presumably Ace) umbrella. So, I can either return the net, or go shopping for 34 yards of Velcro and attach it to my umbrella. Hmmmmm . . . I think I'll take the easy way out. Now, where's that return address . . . ?"
1,Would you know?,"I like Quark. I like Xpress too. I also like in Depth, but I don't know what to do with it. I hope you have enjoyed this report. I know the above information will be helpful if you are into this thing. By the way are you in this thing or out of this thing. I am sorry that I forgot to ask. It makes a lot of difference if you plan to Quark or if you plan to Xpress. I do both when I have time. Probably you do too. I would like to know if you do Quirk more often or if you do Xpress more often."
3,Buy The Collection: 1988-1994,"Whoever picked the songs for Strange Boutique's greatest hits CD did a smashing job. All the songs from Kindest Worlds, that I listen to repeatedly, are on The Collection: 1988-1994. Unless you have plenty of disposable income, skip Kindest Worlds and just buy The Collection. You can use the money you saved to buy a FAITH & THE MUSE CD."
1,DATED MATERIAL,I had to return the book. The material was several year's old and thus very dated. The index was also in very bad shape. Many of the entries were not indexed properly making it diffcult to do research. This book needs a major update and a good copy editor to review it.
3,Not a Bad Book,But is too bad that those facts and figures do not tell you how much money you will make
1,Don't read this book near an open flame,"This book sucks bad, Larry. The End.P.S. I hated this bookP.P.S. Seriously, this book sucks."
4,Thought-provoking,"I like to read a well-written story. I like epic tales. This and the sequels fill the bill, quite nicely. You may need a dictionary handy when reading, due to the choice of terminology the author uses. It's worth it, if you like expanding your vocabulary like I do! This book is one of those books where you won't always assimilate everything there is the first time you read it. Unlike some novels, this one may provide new insights once you've allowed it to sit on the bookshelf for a few months then attack it with a (hopefully) new perspective."
5,For the sake of promotion,"This book is good. Very good. The whole series is exceptionally good. I would not recomment it to anyone; I know too many people who would be unable to appreciate the depth of Wolfe's writing. The emotional, moral, and to a lesser degree philosophical implications create a great deal of depth and longevity to the story. Read the book, then read it again because it's that good."
2,"Not convincing, boring writer","This mixture of fantasy and science fiction has some interesting ideas: Decay of a formerly space-faring planet into a world of fantasy, telling the story from the point of view of a renegade torturer in a guild and caste based social structure. But in the end it disappoints because the people in the story are not convincing, the author never achieves a good rhythm and often rambles around. As a result, I for one, after the first of the two novels packed into one book here, rapidly lost interest and I am now forcing myself to read on just to find out where the story leads."
3,"Not as good as Shadow & Claw, but close.","Read the first book, shadow and claw. Only move on to the second if you have to know what happens (a situation i find slightly unlikely)."
1,101 Exciting New Tips to Energize Your Cheerleaders,"Coaches and fellow cheerleaders, Don't waste your money. This ""work"" is not a book. It is a list. The ideas in the book where neither relavent to cheerleading today or interesting. Cheerleaders are athletes today. These ""tips"" are ancient history."
2,incomplete,"This short cd is incomplete and thus a disappointment. The wonderful spider/forest music is missing among others - this can be heard all through the Laurel and Hardy and March of the Wooden Soldiers - and The Red Mill selection is a poor filler. Why the Red Mill? Since Mr. Brion showcased Babes so why not excerpts from Little Nemo or Wonderland? The OLO Red Mill is wonderful. These excerpts are unnecessary. The Decca Red Mill/Babes in Toyland is a better choice of these two shows if it can be found. Of Brion's three Herbert CDs, only the third - Columbus Suite, etc. - is good and that is disfigured by the choice of selections. Will John McGlinn's Magic Knight, Babes or Lady of the Slipper ever be released? And why no Richard Bonynge Mlle Modiste or Fortune Teller? Or anything Herbert?"
5,Swiss Army Champ,"I bought this for my fiance, he loves it and he used it all the time.He was surprise of how many gadgets the knife has and always finding new things on the knife.I search a lot through different web pages for something special like this one and the best price was Amazon.It got here on time, my fiance like it so much that I bought another one to send to my son in law in the Philippines.He is really going to enjoy it very much."
5,Every girl (and guy) should have one!,"I have had my knife for over 25 years. Can't count how many times a screwdriver, blade, file, tweezer, even the saw, etc. has come into play for myself or even total strangers. And especially the scissors! I keep a small Maglite flashlight attached via the keychain - with that addition I'm ready for just about anything. Yes, my boyfriend (now husband of 25 yrs) thought it a bit strange when I was excited to be able to use my college summer job employee discount to buy a top of the line knife, but he has borrowed it plenty over all these years! And now my college student daughter has requested one for Christmas. So there, guys! My biggest worry is that one of these days I will forget to move it from my purse into a checked bag when flying and end up having it confiscated. Endlessly handy and useful."
5,Best of best deals,I am quite happy in getting this stuff.This has become one of my day to day companions.I cant think of a day with out this.
5,Rugged and dependable,"I carried a SwissChamp from junior high until I replaced it with the larger SwissChamp XLT, at least 10 years. In that time, I used my knife for just about everything. I used just about every tool on it, except the fish scaler. I even used the side of the knife as a hammer to drive a couple small nails! (It scarred up the plastic scales slightly, but didn't harm the knife otherwise.) These things can literally take a pounding!"
5,The right one,"I truly believe the ""Champ"" model is one of the most featured price-wise speaking.It is also not too small or not too big, you can carry it all day long without noticing.There are others with some extra features, but way too big and thick.In the end there are different models for different needs, but the ""Champ"" is one of the most versatile and better priced swiss army knife out there."
5,Simply the best pocket knives,"It never fails to amaze me how much I use this product. It has so many useful functions that it is one of our families most used utensils. I purchased mine in Switzerland, the home of Victorinox, some years ago, and it still performs 100% today. The knives are always sharp. The scissors cut through anything within reason and I have used most every other function at some stage or another. This is a quality product which is reflected in the fact the manufacturer offers a lifetime warranty. Highly recommended and expect to get a lifetime of use."
4,Victorinox Swiss Champ,"The Swiss Champ is one of the most-used tools I have ever had and used throughout my long years as a ""tool guy"". I have continuously carried one for over 35 years, and whenever one needed repairs, I sent it in to be renewed and simply bought another one to use in the meantime. I love the many, many functions of this tool and never considered the Swiss Champ ""over the top"" in having too many functions; I use all of them all of the time. My one complaint with these great tools is that the steel is a bit soft and won't hold an edge for very long. The blades also distort and bend far easier than I would prefer, but then, they also never rust or have sharpening problems either. I could not praise these nice multi tools highly enough. They have proved to be invaluable thousands of times for a life long tool guy like myself, and oh yes, I am a career cabinetmaker and woodworker, which probably explains my love for this great knife."
5,"Exactly what I needed, came with all parts and more.","This swiss army knife is very well made. I got a used item, so it had some wear, but the product itself is solid. I don't know if only my used order came with this, but it also had a case with some minor first-aid stuff like bandaids, and it had a compass on the case as well.But just considering the knife, this product is five starts. The craftmanship is solid and every tool is easily accessible (unlike most swiss army knifes, where I have to spend thirty minutes killing my fingernail to get a tool out). Great."
5,The best Swiss Army knife ever made,"Of the two companies authorized to make Swiss Army knives, Victorinox is the best. Of all the knives made by Victorinox, the Champ Swiss Army knife is the best. This is the Swiss Army knife by which all others are measured. This knife is a little bulky to carry around in a pair of suit pants, but this knife isn't made for playing dress-up. This knife is a true workhorse and is meant to be carried around in your work clothes, jeans, coveralls, or cargo shorts."
5,Wow Just a Good knive,The size my be large but it not that heavey. The grip scraces up but that doesnt matter.I got this as a gift and i love it. You never now when you will need to use one of its incredible 32 stainless steel tools. Its Magnifiying glass is so strong it can light a firer with the sun. If you looking to get a multi-tool that has alot of thins on it the Swiss Champ is your tool.
5,Love love love it,Swiss army knives are something every Scout should have. This is a good one with lots of gadgets. Son loves it.
5,Excellent Purchase,"My husband had this for years and he lost it recently. He is very happy when I bought this for him. This is probably the most used tool in our family, and particularly on vacations and camping trips, we cannot do without this tool."
5,Best Utility Knife for Camping,"My family and I frequently go camping and we are often found needing some specialty tool that would be impossible to pack along in our tight fitting vehicle. It seems like I find myself breaking out the Victorinox Swiss Army Knife at least ten times a day. This thing is the ultimate survival knife and I highly recommend you put it in the glove box of your car for anytime you may be stuck in a jam. I find myself using many of the tools, especially the scissors, tweezers, screwdriver, knife blades and pliers. Other less used but powerful tools are the saw, fish scaler, magnifying glass, and mini-pen. The only complaint from my standpoint is that it is a little bulky, but that is probably something that it can't overcome because of how multi-purpose it is.Pros: Amazing craftsmanship, plenty of tools, great for campingCons: Bulkiness"
4,Elsa's housebook: A woman's photojournal by Elsa Dorfman,purchased this item used and it was in the condition you would expect from being published in the 1970s. took the book to a book signing. an important book of the times. Elsa is a great photographer and a wonderful story teller.
1,Not as hyped up as it seems....,"...got the book with enthusiasm, bought the book with enthusiasm, got the package with enthusiasm, even opened the package with enthusiasm. when i read and looked through it all i felt was an overhwhelming anti-climatic narcosis. how disappointing indeed. craftsmanship, mediocre; style and composition, shows some thinking; writing, rather naive to my taste. however, i should like to give credit to elsa's experience captured in this book. what the book captures is not so much 'photographic substance' but the voice of a woman's experience and the entourage of her emotions. still would rather have my money back though..."
3,Can Fraser Be Slipping?,"I am a longtime George Macdonald Fraser fan, in particular the Flashman Papers. I have read most of his books a half dozen times, and have not tired of them because of Mr. Fraser's fanastic talent for storytelling. ""The Candlemass Road"" began as no exception. However, just as the main characters became fully developed, the story ended! I felt as if I had read part of a terrific GMF novel, only to be denied the ending. It grieves me to give less than five stars to my hero, but I must!"
4,McConnell's Research on the Faith Movement,"This is a very well researched and footnoted book by Dr. McConnell on the Faith Movement. I think many people who are watching Kenneth Copeland and others on TV would be surprised to learn of where this Faith Movement came from. The book is ""a little"" had to read. It seems very much like a textbook. But it really does bring the reader ""up to speed"" on understanding where the Faith Movement has come from, and how the Faith Movement may lead some Christians to become disillusioned. That is the problem with the Faith Movement as I see it. It may cause a young Christian to backslide or quick the Christian Church because God may not heal or provide a job or whatever they are praying about when they pray and ask believing!"
2,The pot calling the kettle black,"The charismatics and pentecostals work hard at trying to win legitimacy.This, to me, is simply another attempt to do just that. Mr. McConnell, by attacking the faith movement, distracts readers from the deficiencies within pentecostalism while gaining a reputation as a 'scholar'. He needs to argue, Biblically, for pentecostalism first, which cannot be done.The Faith movement can't be argued biblically, the pentecostal movement can't be argued biblically and on and on. The core issue has been, is, and will always be, those who side with the Word of God alone, ""sola scriptura,"" and those who don't. Those who don't are simply two errors arguing against each other. In a nutshell, more confusion within Christendom."
1,I am appalled...,"...at some of the comments in this review! Especially the young man who says there is no need for faith. Obviously he hasn't read where it says in the Bible that it's impossible to please God without it. I am not a follower of Hagin, Hanegraaff or anyone else; no one other than Jesus my Lord and Savior. I will say two things, however, 1. You know them by their fruit. The fruit of the Hagin Ministry (even of Copeland's) has been one of healing. Despite all the hoopla, I personally know this for myself. 2. Those who try to divide the Body Of Christ are not of the Body Of Christ. Which brings us right back to #1. Read the Bible for yourself before judging someone or making them your spokesman. Speak the Words of Jesus. Ask Him for the correct understanding. Note: If your child was dying and Hagin and Hanegraaff were the only ministers available, which one would you want to pray for the child?"
1,One of the Most Shameful Books to be Written in Years,"This book is a poorly researched book with conclusions that don't stand up under close examination. Mr. McConnell has taken quotes out of context; he has distorted the teaching of Dr. Hagin to the point of unbelievability. There isn't a ministry that is more solid, stable and ethical than Kenneth Hagin Ministries. The Bible teaches that we will know them by their fruits and the fruits of Dr. Hagin's ministry are longlasting and godly. It is unfortunate that someone like Mr. McConnell would distort someone's life's work such as he has."
1,I have a question!!,"If your child was sick and expected to only live for another year, who would you rather have to pray for your child?:a ""Word-of-faith"", Charismatic Christian who believes in divine health and hasn't been sick in 38 years?!ORa ""Fundamentalist"" who believes that miraculous healings have ""ceased"" and have been ""done away"" with?!Give that one some thought..."
1,"Not that this book was bad, but it just doesn't work.","This book is a good study tool and how doubters think. I've studied the faith movement, and I found that God initiated it with creation. So, I doubt that you will find that this book will be able to succeed against God and His faith movement. I know that there are vessel out there with ""Big names"", but can God not make them big, when they teach his Word? Even John was made ""Big"" by saying ""I must decrease, so that He can increase"". No, the movment that is really criticized here by McConnell is the Doubt Movement, which was initiated, not by God, as McConnell would so subtly and ignorantly suggest, but by Lucifier."
4,Our cats give this 5 stars,"I give it 4 because their enthusiasm for it leaves little bits of the scratcher littered around the area. If you don't mind vacuuming wherever it is regularly, this is a great way to keep your cats from scratching the furniture. Add a bit of catnip to increase their desire for it."
4,Why buy a bed!,My kitties love the size of this scratcher so much that if find them laying on it instead of their bed. I also find that they last longer because my cat uses the whole surface and just not the ends.
3,Not for all paws,"Whether your feline will opt to tear this up in lieu of a leatherette couch is purely a question of individual preference. My big Himalayan kitten didn't evince any interest in it before I poured some of its enclosed catnip upon it, and hasn't since. However, my older cat excitedly claws it and chews its edges. Nonetheless, you'll surely fare better with a scratching post; housecats are commonly inclined to stretch and rise when mauling savagely, so an upright target is naturally preferable.Despite the robust construction of its box, this pad's price is absurdly high for a chunk of corrugated cardboard!"
4,"Nice product, but you're better off getting a combination one...","I recently adopted a cat, and of course, ended up overbuying what I really needed for him since I was excited. This was one of those items, and from day one he kept scratching at it, saving what limited furninture I can fit in my small apartment. So in that sense, it does work. It's simple, it's a box of cardboard with catnip, and cats scratch it.A week or so later, looking for even more things to spoil my new cat with, I found items that incorporated this same design with that of other toys. For example, the ""Blitz Turboscratcher"" which is a circular track with a ball inside that a cat can bat around and chase in an endless loop with this same cardboard in the center for them to scratch. (and with catnip as well)Therefore, while this product does work as intended, and quite well, you're probably better off buying a toy that incorporates this same design with another activity, even though it will likely be slightly more expensive."
4,All Of Eazy E's Hits,"This is a pretty good CD with all of Eazy E's hits over the years. My favorite songs are Boyz-N-The-Hood (remix), I'd Rather **** You, and Automobile."
3,Interesting Writing Style,Jacques Lanzman provides a high density of details about many individuals in this book that has an almost random and gossipy style of writing. I still found it enjoyable even though I found it a bit scattered.Translator's Kiss
3,Accessible if not Readable,"Craig Raine's In Defence of T.S. Eliot is a series of useful and interesting literary essays, one of which focuses on T.S. Eliot's Anti-semitism. Generally quite sound criticism, if not thoroughly scholarly, Raine knows what he is talking about. His style is accesible to all, and it is that kind of light literary criticism one can read in bed. The dictum out on the streets is the following: Raine may be accessible, but he is definately not readable. This however applies to his poetry and not to his criticism (which is, as stated before, not too bad). For a touch of Raine's poetic genius, check out his latest (i think) long poem, titled: a la recherche du temps perdu, to my dead Mistress... have fun."
4,Another good Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery,"Judith Flynn's B & B is playing host to Hollywood producer Bruno Zept and before she knows it, Judith is also being invaded by Bruno's whole entourage who are in town for the premier of their latest movie. Judith has a hard time coping with the demands of this eccentric Hollywood crew and soon one of them is lying dead in her kitchen sink! She and husband Joe are afraid that they will be held liable for the murder, so they begin their own investigation. They uncover all sorts of unsavory secrets about their guests and there are plenty of motives for murder. Daheim throws in plenty of red herrings, and the revelation of the real murderer is a surprise. Her characters are delightfully drawn and the plot is sufficiently complicated to keep the reader guessing until the very end. This is a cozy reader's delight!"
2,Nice Try,"I'm not a big fan of the mystery genre, but this book didn't help me like mystery novels. I haven't read any other books in Daheim's B&B series, but I don't think I want to. The writing was weak, the characters have very little dimension, and there was just too much subplot (if you can call it that).Joe was about the only character that appealed to me. He actually used his brains to assist, unlike Judith who could charm anyone, no matter how unwilling they were to talk. And Renie was just annoying.Attempts at comedy usually fell flat. Gertrude was pretty fun, though. I think we all know someone a bit like that (for me, it's my aunt).The reason I'm giving this book two stars is because it's a light-read and it's meant to be one. But it's not the quality I was hoping for when I picked it up at the bookstore."
1,review of book,"i like the trumps, but i don't like this book. i prefered the books written by donald much better."
2,Not much new information,"I read this book in one night. Unfortunately, there was nothing ""new"" in it to help me with my IC. It was basically just an overview of what IC is and some treatment options. I would not recommend buying it, you can find any of it's information on any IC website of pamplet."
2,"GO SEE DR MOLDWIN, I DID","I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA. AFTER READING DR. MOLDWIN'S BOOK MY HUSBAND DROVE US TO SEE HIM IN NEW YORK BECAUSE I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN I JUST WANTED TO DIE. IT TOOK ONLY ABOUT 2 MONTHS TO GEY AN APPOINTMENT. HE EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME EXACTLY WANT TO DO TO GET BETTER, CAUSE IC PATIENTS ARE ALL DIFFERENT. I AM 100% CURED. MY OTHER DOCTORS CANNOT BELIEVE IT. 100% CURED. WITH PRAYERS AND FOLLOWING WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO AFTER A YEAR IN PAIN 24 HOURS A DAY, I AM NOW PAIN FREE!!"
5,good stuff,i used to watch this movie at my grandmothers house when i was younger.. she had it taped for us..its a great movie and brings back good memories for me.
5,The Title Says It All,"A wonderful book! about a life well lived and enjoyed, and thankfully Mr. P is still on the planet. I must take issue with the Publishers Weekly review; it does not follow a predictable format, and why would it? Anyone who has heard this musical giant in live performance or on recordings realizes that the superlative, wonderful music that pours from his soul and through his fingers is truly a Jazz Odyssey. OP may have some idea of where he wants it to go, but in the end his musical journey of surprise and discovery is ours too. This is a book to read and re-read - just like his recordings, you will discover something new that you missed the last time around. Kudos!"
5,wow this is good,"oh man this album is so good!!!! the middle eastern influences on ""the fate"" are just fantastic! this chick can scream, but she can also grunt, squeal, chirp and sing. hell she can probably yodel too if she were to join finntroll or something. great album, very original."
4,Well made and Comfortable,"These are great daily wear shoes, goes nicely with both casual and formal wear. Very well made and comfortable Fit & finish is consistent, leather is smooth.Quality and comfort wise these are better than Bostonian's & Rockport's and just a notch below johnston murphy.Couple of minor things though I had to replace factory shoe inserts with after market ones (Dr scholls) because factory one's doesn't have much arch support. Another inconvenience is that right shoe squeals, hopefully that will be fine after wearing few more times."
5,BCC Classic,"What up! Its time to take you back to the 96 where people was wearing fatigues and Tims, does it get any better than underground East Coast in the Mid 90's? This Cd is one of my favorites, a must buy, so let the Madness Begin and get this album!"
4,it's a cross between the underground and gangsta rap,"First off it's more like a 3.5 but i always round up. This cd is pretty good. Rock is a tight mc but they rap too much about violence. It gets old to me after a while. If you like lyrical and violent rap this album is probably for you. Tracks that i particularly appreciate are ... therapy, place to be, soldiers gone phyco and the great unknown. Again i want to reemphasize that this cd's main topic is street violence and it gets a little boring. Like i said though Rock is an ill mc."
3,Only nr.4 in Boot Camp top ten,"Get enta da stage, da shinin or the first OGC album before you buy this one. Don't get me wrong it's alright, it's no classic though. Beatminerz didn't handle all the production and the result is a good but not spectacular album."
4,Essential hardcore hip-hop recording,"From the opening skit, this album transcends it's title. The production of ""Nocturnal"" invokes the darkest of Brooklyn nights, indeed, as tour guides Ruck and Rock (a dynamic duo whose flow can't be matched except maybe by EPMD) allow us to follow them through the excellent tracks on this album. Production by everyone from regular BCC contributors (Da Beatminerz) to E-Swift from Tha Alkaholiks lays down a track on this great album. The highlights have to be ""Undastand,"" whose understated melody and bottom-heavy beat thump along like there's no tomorrow, and the final track on the album, ""Operation Lockdown,"" another track made with minimal melody to give all the attention to the MC's. And do they ever deserve it. Ruck and Rock's lyrical flow is unparalleled in comtemporary hip-hop. Their tag-team verses make for great listening, and a superb album. If you're into hardcore hip-hop, you need this album."
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS ONE!!!,"A CLASSIC, straight up...this joint right here is one of the tightest albums, regardless of the music genre. These dudes can flow, are original, and bring an energy to the mike (and complement one another) to a level not seen since old EPMD. Magnum Force was tight, and some prefer it to this, but buy them both."
5,"If you are down with any kind of Rap, it's a must you step!","First of all, if I could give this album 6 stars I would! In all seriousness it is one of the best rap albums in the last 5 years. Like they say,""this is what you get when Rock and Ruck start overreacting."" This album destroys the new album if you are considering buying one or the other. It also contains artists like O.G.C., llla Noyz, and the Representatives. Bottom line: it's on constant rotation in my player along with the other Bootcamp hits. To end this I would like to give a shoy out to the Scottman in Wayne and Brooklyn for holding it down."
2,too easy,"and not so many good songs covered. I was hoping for something better,disappointed. This is for beginner player but not so appealing."
