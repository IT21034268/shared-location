5,Powerful,"This book left me feeling much the same as I felt after reading Angela's Ashes.To say that it is a wonderful, powerful and sometimes very funny account of growing up in Rhodesia, which it is, does not address how terribly sad and deprived this woman's childhood was.Ms. Fullers childhood was full of dirt and disorder, alcohol, death and racial tension. That she was able to grow up to write about it so beautifully and not to have lost the humor it provided is nothing short of amazing.Just as in Angela's ashes, you will not like the parents. Put that aside and enjoy the book."
1,The Dogs Tonight,"The problem with this book is its laden, self-pitying tone. I got no sense of the beautiful country of Zimbabwe, the beautiful natives of that great country or of the incredible, formidable liberation struggle fought in that country for close to a generation. This... book and in many instances dangerously incomplete and infactual. Fuller has atleast an obligation to the historical facts, I would think, if nothing else. Her prose also made reading this book torturous. Unless you're Toni Morrison or Thomas Pynchon then you shouldn't attempt complex metaphors else they fall flat and come of as foolish, confusing and unintentionally funny. For the more literate readers out there looking for a good book, don't believe the hype on this sensationalist mess. There are many other writers, black Zimbabwean women writers, who are writing about the same period, about the same things with more intelligence, depth, feeling, compassion and humor. I would try them first."
3,Needs an intelligent publisher,"This very well written book appears to have been issued by a publisher who doesn't understand publishing. This book could have become a classic, but it will sink from view because of its unmemorable, difficult to pronounce title. The poor cover also suggests that this publisher doesn't know how to market books. Writers getting published for the first time seem to have no idea how important it is to choose a publisher who knows what it's doing."
4,Compelling. A story you will want to devour.,"There are currently 266 other reviews of this book available here, so I won't waste time revisiting the plot. The author tells her story in first person, with the insight and ""wisdom"" of the child she is throughout most of this book. The realities for her include terrorism, alcoholism, depression, racism, death. But through it all is the love of family, strength of character, and the background of a very real Africa that few of us could ever know. Although the chronology is jumbled at first, the reader can quickly acclimate to the unusual flow of the dialogue and novel. But it is for this reason that I give it 4, not 5 stars. It certainly is a book that left me wishing for a sequel."
4,Outstanding,"Alexandra Fuller has written an unsentimental, darkly funny memoir about growing up as a white settler in Africa during the midst of change.Fuller describes civil war, poverty (her own family's, as well as the Africans who live near them), and the loss of her family's farm without self-pity or apology.The lure, as well as the dangers, of the ex-patriot lifestyle are evident in each event. Fuller's descriptions of her mother's alcohoism, and battle with mental illness evoke empathy for the family."
3,don't lets go to the dogs tonight:an african childhood,"I enjoyed this book in the beginning, but it was slow moving to me. Interesting culture in Africa. Disturbing subject matter."
3,Not the most stimulating,"The book was okay, really didn't keep me wanting to read the next chapter. More of a history of the family and living conditions in Africa and the family dynamics that occured in that environment. I wouldn't recommend it unless your interested in the Africian life at that time and the hardships and internal wars that seem never ending."
2,disturbing,"I just finished reading"" Don't lets go "", and I have to say, I find myself totally disturbed. On the one hand the story is fascinating. But I was hoping that at the end Alexandra would come around and not be such a racist.Black Africans are hardly mentioned except as inept servants. Even at the end of the book she says that there aren't any europeans living nearby for her parents to talk to now.I'm wondering what she now teaches her children.I thought that the way she turned her mother's alcholism into humorous episodes was false. there was an absence of fear of the situation which i think would be inevitable if your parents were as unstable and idiotic as the ones portrayed in the book."
3,It was alright..,"I wonder if I would have liked this book more if it hadn't been Entertainment Weekly's pick for nonfiction book of the year. I love Entertainment Weekly so much that nothing I could have read would have been able to live up to those kinds of accolades.This story different had a different setting than a lot of the other memoirs I've been reading lately, but more or less it was just more of the same. Drunken parents doing crazy things, moving the kids around at random, yawn. There were wonderful descriptions of Africa. Most of them I found oppressive and made me want to bathe after each chapter. There was just so much talk about sweat and poop. Poop and sweat."
1,Being born in an interesting part of the world should not be an excuse for just anybody to write,"Alright, so her childhood was a bit different than your average white middle-income childhood.Should this motivate anybody to write a completely non-imaginative, devoid of any insights book?Don't be fooled by the exotic side of it. A poor writer can ruin a story, regardless of the exotic locale.If you were expecting to find an ""international"" jewel like Jhumpa Lahiri's ""The Namesake"" or Zadie Smith's ""On Beauty"", you will be greatly disappointed.If you are into Africa, read something that has more than the exotic place to say for itself. Ben Okri's ""The Famished Road"" (booker prize winner) or The Palm-Wine Drinkard and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (Paperback)by Amos Tutuola will be much better choices."
1,Terrible book,"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African ChildhoodI read a review of this autobiography which raised my interest. But after reading fully two-thirds of the book, I was disheartened at the racist attitude of nearly all of the significant white characters in the book: her mother, father, and even the young woman herself. It re-inforced the cruel treatment of the Black majority in then Rhodesia by the members of the White minority we met while reading it. I strongly recommend anyone interested in reading this book to check it out of a library, rather than purchase it. I am a white woman aged 61 and I was very dissapointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone. Thank you."
2,Don't Let's Read this Book - Ever,"A topic which held such promise was a bitter disappointment. The story struggled along, largely because it was very difficult to follow her chronology or lack thereof. So much was left out regarding the war and social struggle of the time in an effort to spotlight her family, that it left me wanting to know more about the country and times in order to understand what her family was going through. Fuller bounces around from one time in her life to another without any consistency. Overall, this book was just very boring and there was nothing to grab onto as a reader."
1,dysfunction junction...,"I joined a book club in order to broaden my pop book horizons. This is the first book on the reading list, and I am starting to rethink the book club because of it. I was really looking for a good story of living in Africa, and being in the melee of the troubled times of Rhodesia. I have very little time to read a book, and I have gotten half way through this disjointed memory collection of a dysfunctional family via an audiobook. The audio book narrator is good, but the story is just horrible. It is depressing, dysfunctional, and all over the place. I expected to find the book written with a slight racist slant, due to the time and the place, but I didn't expect this. I should have saved my $20 for the audiobook. Its so not worth the money. It should have been re-written as a surviving dysfunctional parents book...there really is no point to the story line."
1,Don't let's Go to the Dogs,I trudge through this book to learn a little history but I despised the book and gave it's companion away. I did not find the drinking and drunkenness at all appealing. Ugh!
3,ok,"I enjoyed the writing style of this book, but found it overall depressing. There were a few bits that were funny/ touching. I probably wouldn't reccomend it to a friend."
3,Incredibly sad,"Although mostly well-written, this memoir is very depressing. I was expecting more about Africa from this NF book, but it's largely the tale of a highly dysfunctional family that suffers blow after blow, bringing much of it on itself. And no one seems to learn anything from their mistakes. The Book of Job is uplifting reading by comparison."
4,Highly recommended,"This book is fascinating, though not the best pick for those with a weak stomach. It's painfully honest and that's why I loved it. The author has a really rich yet simple way of writing, so you feel, smell, see, taste the entire experience they had growing up in Africa. It's far from a comfortable way of life, and it's downright depressing in some parts, but that's reality. I really respect someone who is able to write about their own life without glamorizing it nor condemning it."
4,An uncomfortable read,"This is a very personal account of a girl growing up in Africa.Feels a lot like reading someone's diary, with the family's losses, grief, and subsequent functional breakdown exposed for all to see.It's written truthfully, maybe too much so.I was very absorbed by this book, but I'm not sure I can say I actually enjoyed it."
3,Very Jumpy,"The reason I chose this book was because it was about Africa, and I thought Zimbabwe specifically. What it turned out to be is more about Fuller's extremely eccentric family with Africa (various countries) as a backdrop. It was a fairly good read, just not what I expected. Written smoothly for fast reading. The only hard part is that she jumps around in time a bit and that can be a little harder to follow considering how much they moved and the socio-political events at the time. I would recommend this as a summer/vacation read, particularly if you are interested in families or family dysfunction, but less so if you are looking to read much more about Africa."
4,A great read......,I found that I could not put this book down. I have long been interested in and even lived in Africa and found this to be one of the most engrossing books I have read in a long time.
1,One for the dogs,The story jumps around a few lossess but am at a loss as to how or why this ever won an award.
1,Just meanders . . .,"I read this book for my book club. It just seemed to meander through her childhood, no real plot or climax. Yes, this girl definitely had a different type of childhood, but what makes it that interesting or significant?????"
1,Wild Romantic Africa?,"For all you potenetial readers who are like me, students of Africa and African literature, don't make the mistake of being mislead by the subtitle: An African Childhood. Africa is a large contintent made up of over 50 countries and several hundred ethnic groups. In the South and the East where the soil is rich and the material benefits large, white settlers can still be found. Fuller conflated a particular white settler Rhodesian childhood with African somehow. Like the South African afronaut, this is a silly claim and misleading if you are truly seeking to read a book on Africa and Africans.On the plus side, she loves animals and gives nice descriptions of the non-human native life forms."
1,White man point of view,This book is basically a white mans point of view of the great continent that they distroyed. The political system in Zimbabwe is not ment for African peoples benefit that is why you have or may i say had whites advanced on the farms. All i can say is I am happy R. Mugabe a true Revolutionary chased them off the land and gave it to its rightfull heirs.Golden BallzProud Zimbabwean
2,Didn't enjoy,"Found this book very disappointing. Found the book boring and difficult to get through. I was expecting an exciting book about growing up in Africa, unfortuntately found an almost-documentary, very un-exciting and didn't manage to finish the book. I am surprised that it had such a high price on it."
5,Lets go to the dogs...,"I thought this was an awesome book. It was so unbelievably interesting!!Whether interested in Africa or not, it is amazing how this family lives, how they ""rough it"" not because they had to, but because they wanted to. They live in homes that only have electricity part of the day and never mind indoor plumbing. The mother is a very likeable character who, it seems, is an alcoholic by default - she lives through the death of two toddlers. You read about how the mother uses a rifle to shoot a snake in the kitchen and how the narrator and her mother go on a long, hot journey by horseback to round up some wild cattle.I know my review is not doing the book justice, but look how many others like it!"
4,book review,This is a book for my book club. It took a while to arrive but it came in good condition and was a great read. Makes me want to go to Africa.
4,Not racism but realism,"This book takes me back to the 12 years I spent in Southern Africa. Africa is where it all started and there is something in the blood that draws me back there.The descriptions are evocative and beautiful, and convey something of the problems people encountered when trying to survive in Africa. Despite all the corruption and problems I can't help loving the people there, of all races. I can't say the same about politically correct critics that have never even been there. For your information there was, for all its faults, more freedom and justice in 1970's Rhodesia than in many black African countries and a hell of a lot more than there is in Zimbabwe now. Not to mention enough food to feed everybody!"
4,Disturbing but hypnotic book,"A fascinating book concerning a part of African history and its effects on one family. There are some terrible things that happen within this family, but somehow you want to keep reading, maybe to find out what happens in the end. What a remarkable young woman to write such a powerful book. It's tough to put this book down once you've started reading."
2,A Traumatic Childhood?,"I read this book before Ms Fuller's ""Scribbling the Cat"". I am the same age as Ms Fuller, and also grew up in small Rhodesian towns. I found the racism and generalisation that all white Rhodesian are racist very offensive. Some of my best friends when I was growing up were black children, and if I or my siblings had behaved towards black people the way Ms Fuller and her family did we would have been severely disciplined. This book made me ashamed to be a white African, and I actually have no reason to feel that way."
4,Doom and Survival in modern Africa,"Poignant memoir with moving tributes of emigrant love and perspective for several countries in central Africa. A. Fuller writes beautifully without self pity or rose tinted filter when recording parental flaws. I gained as much insight for post-colonial Africa as I did for Fuller's experience as a white Anglo during these years. (Read her second memoir - ""Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness"" first, but found this book equally compelling.)"
4,Great Book,"I was also struck by the mixed reaction to this wonderful book. I am also amused at how easily we use the words rascist and racism - almost like food labels, salt or pepper?The one star folks are made uncomfortable by the book. They see it as presenting a piece of the African story they had rather not imagine. They miss the point.Ms. Fuller's book, a sort of Angela's Ashes mixed with Out of Africa, is enjoyable because it is not judgemental or romanticized. It is the story of a family's life with all the warts and blemishes. It is funny, sad, shocking, heroic, amazing, eccentric, and at time unsettling. Hurray for her."
5,RECONCILIATION,"MS FULLER HAS TOUCHED MY HEART WITH THIS BOOK AND HEALED A LOT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH THE MERCELESS WHITE PEOPLE, AS A BLACK CHILD WHO GROW UP IN ZIMBABWE. MS FULLER ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON WHETHER WHITE PEOPLE ARE JUST STRAIGHT UP EVEIL OR WHAT. SHE EXPLAINED HOW THEY FELT THE NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE BLACK PEOPLE (MAJORITY) AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS WAS INSTILL FEAR IN THESE AFRICANS.. AT THE SAME TIME SHE JUST EXPLAINED THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF ZIMBABWE AND THE STRUGGLES THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING THROUGHT THUS HELPING ME TO SUPPORT THE LAND REFORM IN CURRENTLY GOING ON IN ZIMBABWE.SHE IS A LIVING HERO WHO HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY ANY WHITE PEOPLE I REALLY SALUTE HER AND WOULD LOVE TO MEET HER AND WRITE A BOOK OR SHARE EXPERIENCE WITH FULLER."
5,Luminous,"One reviewer here gave this book one star because he thought the protagonist and her family racist. He is mostly right. None of that need detract from the fact that this is a superb book with a transparency and sense of place rarely seen.you may not always agree with what you read in it but that does not make it any less worth reading. Speaking as a mixed race man who has lived in many places in Africa, I found this to be honest and well-observed. The fact that the author does not attempt to re-write her family history to appear politically correct speaks for her honesty.Go read this magnificent book."
4,"A Shocking, Vivid Memoir","Written as a series of stream-of-concsiousness stand-alone essays, but organized in a linear fashion, covering the period of time from the author's birth, through her marriage. I live in Africa, which makes me appreciate the author's descriptions even more. I have traveled extensively in both southern and central Africa, although I've never been to the locations described in the book. Her descriptions are extremely vivid-after reading this book, I feel that I've been to these places, and experienced her life with her. Nevertheless, I found her young life shocking in many ways. The book also helped me understand the current political climate of Zimbabwe today, and the origin of why the blacks are dispossing the white farmers today. A very good book."
4,Wonderful,"A very shatteringly honest depiction of a family's struggle to survive in a hostile environment. Having spent a month in Africa many years ago,it was easy for me to understand the appeal of that country. The smells, the scenery and colors are like none anywhere else in the world. My first reaction to the book was ""why would parents want to raise children in such dangerous and potentially fatal surroundings?"" I am certain, however, that Bobo would not have traded her childhood for any pampered ""normal"" upbringing that could have been provided. Likewise,we her readers, would never have gotten to enjoy this book.I wish the author would have gone into a little more detail about the circumstances that brought her family to Africa and why they persisted in this difficult life, but maybe that is fodder for another book. Let's hope so!"
4,Ups and Downs Captured Beautifully,Fuller tells one story during a particularly politically charged time in history with an amazing amount of levity and perspective. This makes her a fantastic story teller!
4,Colonial life from the inside,"Excellent writing---entertaining and full of good solid information. If you have ever been curious about the nitty-gritty of mid- 20th century colonialism, this is a good way to discover what the reality was for the people who lived it."
3,An 8 Year Old with an Uzi?,"The writing is interesting with vivid descriptions of life in Africa as seen by a child growing up there. But the subject matter is distressing and depressing -- about a family dysfunctional to the point of almost being criminal. I mean seriously, letting an 8-year old handle an Uzi? Smoke cigarettes? Drink beer? I'm pretty sure I'd not have finished reading this book if it weren't required reading for this month's selection of our book club."
3,A Good Read but Dry in Places,The beginning of the book was good. It gave a great in depth view of Fuller's life in Africa. Towards the middle of the book it all became a bit predictable however. I sometimes feel as though I have already the same scenario a few chapters before. Otherwise the book was very well written. Fuller's bluntness and partial naiveness made the book easy to get through.
2,I've met people like this,"Have you ever known someone who likes to talk a little bit too much? They go on and on with story after story. Some of it is entertaining, but it doesn't all link together and make much sense. If so, that would be a good description of this book. Parts of it are entertaining and interesting, but it mostly feels like random jumps, one after another, with no glue to hold it all together. Random stories with a lot of negativity and very little redeeming value. It didn't work for me."
3,Book club,"If it wasn't on my book club list I would not have chosen to read it. If you need something to get you to sleep, then I would recommend it."
5,A must-read book,"I have always loved reading, but once in a while you come across a book that is so beautiful, you almost want to drink it; this is one. I found myself desperate to pick it up and read more, at the same time pacing myself; not wanting the experience of reading it to end. Alexandra Fuller's style is refreshingly different, and I think this book has firmly taken its place in my top three all time favourites."
4,Many questions left unanswered,"I am a big fan of the spy and espionage genre and it was interesting reading 'The Liquidator.' It was good getting away from the seriousness of it all and reading of an assasin who loves getting paid for killing, but not killing anybody himself. He has a fear of flying and his womanising will get him into trouble.The reader follows an assassin working for the government known as Boysie Oakes. What starts off as a dirty weekend turns into a mission and Boysie lands himself within the grasps of the enemy before chapter three.As the book progresses there is more action that gets the blood pumping, but when you reach the last page...there are alot of unanswered questions. However I can't write these questions down as it will divulge to much of the plot and make the book worthless to read.So if you want a break from the seriousness of it all, then read Boysie Oakes adventure in 'The Liquidator"
4,CNN Headline News + Film Every Five Minutes = Injustice,"Echoing sentiments expressed by other reviewers, I wholly concur after reading ""Official Negligence"" that negligent, inflammatory US media reporting, abetted by the jump-to-conclusion negligence of the Los Angeles Police Department, significantly and overwhelmingly warped public perception of the Rodney King affair and propagated the worst riots in recent history.Taken in the context of the entire story, as reported in ""Official Negligence,"" the police officers were racially railroaded and politically double-jeopardized by a media/legal system that -- once it had seen the film excerpt -- truly never wanted to make any further effort to learn the facts of the case.This is an important book to read, if for no other reason than to keep you alert from now forward when watching television news. They're going to show you what SELLS, and not necessarily what TELLS."
4,Should be required reading for Politicians&Police Managers,"Lou Cannon has put together an account of the culture and climate within the city of Los Angeles preceding the Rodney King incident and the ensuing riots that really hits the mark. As a person who was directly involved in law enforcemnt during the period the book focuses on, I thought I had the entire King incident and riots figured out. on the contrary, I was completely blindsided by the information in this book. Cannon has done his homework and has put together a shocking and revealing account of the King incident, trial and years leading up to it. I would strongly recommend this book to anybody interested in the history of L.A., it's police department and political climate. It should be required reading for all Police recruits, lawyers, politicians and managers."
4,Official Negligence: How Rodney King & the Riots changed LA...,"Well researched & written. I lived & worked through the riots and was present at several locations to observe first hand the lack of senior leadership at the command level.Sgt D. Pugel, LAPD Ret."
5,Must Reading for Anyone Considering a career in Law Enforcement.,"This book provides an in-depth study of a case that most people thought they understood. Yet in reality the media failed to tell the ""real"" story on this nightmare. This should be mandatory reading for anyone planning a career in law enforcement."
3,Not Totally Satisfying.,"I intentionally picked a book that looked lightweight in order to get me back in the practice of reading earnestly, and this book certainly didn't disappoint as far as its lightweightedness is concerned.I wanted something thin and not too difficult, but this doesn't mean I didn't want something emotionally and intellectually satisfying. It's a ho-hum mystery with not too much thrillings. Georges Simenon doesn't even make it very suspensful with who the killer is.Maigret Sets A Trap isn't bad. It's just--plain. Something you could read in a couple of days, discard, and forget about immediately.I'll tell you one thing: just be grateful your mother isn't like the lady in this one. I can see how the guy became a serial killer."
4,Nice date,"Featuring Bill Coleman, Ike Quebec, and the seldom recorded Joe Eldridge, Roy's brother, on alto sax, this date is a delight from beginning to end."
1,not informative...or honest,"this is a poorly made video. It's a poorly researced supposedly 'independent' guide to the best rollar coasters. However, strangely, only coasters on the west coast are highlighted and even more strange Magic mountain seems to be the center of attention.Some of these coasters look good, but a roller coaster guide that doesn't include Ohio or Florida is at best incomplete."
2,Californian Coasters DVD,"I want to know where it states only western coasters, mainly Californian ones at that? why not call this DVD coasters of the US west?What I really wanted to see was a proper state with coasters, and that's Ohio!!!! with Cedar Point with the best ones going, nothing comes close in California to that park.My best DVD is ""America's Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills: The Ultimate Scream Machines"" has Flordia ones included too, beter by far view of them."
4,Very good !,"A good Stuart Woods book, with the twists & turns of mystry, that he usually writes. Keeps you on pins & needles."
2,Typical Woods novel,"It had been several years since I read a Stuart Woods novel. After reading LA Times, I remembered why I hadn't bothered with one of his new releases for years. The characters are like cardboard cutouts being moved through one utterly non- believable scene after another. Woods makes it clear to his readers, once again, that he lacks any ability to discern how real people go about their lives and what is actually remarkable about human interaction.After wasting a few hours reading this latest ""novel"" of his, I wonder whether he huffs airplane glue from a paper bag before sitting down to write. Maybe his next effort will include at least one believable scene or one character who is at least two-dimensional. Perhaps that's what his regular readers keep hoping for, though why they bother is beyond me."
3,AVERAGE,"This book was not what I had expected from one of my favorite authors. It started out alright, but the ending was not up to the ability of Mr. Woods. Hopefully next time."
4,A Star Is Born,"When Rita was demanded to leave the band ""Os Mutantes"", by his boyfriend and partner, Arnaldo Baptista, she has commented, years later, she felt afraid it was time to give up of her career. Nevertheless, she got moving forward. And the result of her strong spirit is this splendid CD (1974), where she finally found her own sound. Nowadays, songs as ""Mamae Natureza"", ""Ando Meio Jururu"", ""Yo No Creo Pero..."", ""Tratos a Bola"" and the balad ""Menino Bonito"" are the classics that are, as well, witness of her talent and perseverance. And Baptista would receive an answer, made as a song (""Agora So Falta Voce""), brilliantly written by Rita in her next album - the best one, even when comparing it among those with Mutantes(""Fruto Proibido"").Genius Stuff."
1,Men Aloud,My fault. I mistook this DVD for the choir that was on 'Britain has Stars' or similar. The choir was ex-street kids formed into 'Only Men Aloud'. The one I received is bearable but only just. Not so much a preview but a scathing reminder about reading what you what correctly and not assuming!!
3,A thoughtful alternative,"A married businessman's extramarital affair turns scary when he attempts to break up. Sound familiar? But this isn't a remake of FATAL ATTRACTION. This is a quieter film, nicely told. Whereas FA went for paroxysm and panic, this steers a thoughful course.The main actors are very good with the beautiful Hedye Tehrani, as the other woman, taking top honors. Too bad the story couldn't continue with the character she exhibited at the beginning of the film: smart, confident and forthright (she persists in inviting the married man into her home for a drink -- and ultimately to the bedroom). Her character's backstory was one of the most interesting parts of the story but it was too brief."
4,Different,"It was quite disturbing in a decent way. I appreciate the idea of a mildly depraved little town going to hell, but I detest cliff hangers or I'd have given a 5 star rating. Could have had better sense of evil, was a good read though"
4,If you love Halloween... this is a must read!,"This was a really fun book to read; as a kid I loved Halloween and this book brought that feeling back to me. The author does an excellent job creating an atmosphere, it's so easy to visualize the small town in the story and the events as they unfold. The only two areas that were a ""bit"" disappointing were the ending- to quick and abrupt, considering how long the author took to set up the story. The other was a few loose ends, for example, what ever happened to the six missing teens that were attacked in ""Witches Hollow"". All in all, it was a fun story, I look forward to reading it again next fall!! Enjoy!"
2,I be appalled!!!,"I gave this two stars instead of one because I did enjoy the first two parts. It lost me in the third. When the heroine gave herself to Richard and agreed that it was ok to break her married vows, but when he marries into a woman of ""his station"" it would not be ok for him. I say, No Deal. I decided to give the woman the benefit of the doubt, as she had been a strong, rather independent for the times, and outspoken gall up until this point. However, she proceeds to give Richard three sons, the last of which she throws away as not to harm his marriage to Anne. I would also like to add, she allowed her gay husband to smack her around a bit. I am truly not impressed. I like to read about strong, admirable woman and I found this woman horribly weak. My only other compliant is the peasant speak was a bit much. ""I be here.. You be there.. I be sorry"" are examples. It makes it a difficult read at times."
3,sue,"It is not a badly written book, it is very readable and a good fiction. However for historical fiction I prefer something a little more realistic. It is just a little to simplistic, at the end Kate even rides to where Richard final battle is to see him off, not particularly plausible. I suppose I just prefer my historical fiction to be a little more factual and this sort of missed that part. More of romantic than historical novel. Still, as not a bad read."
4,heart-felt,"I enjoyed this book. The only thing I did not like was my confusion in the politics. I do like reading about the politics during this time, but I have only started. In turn I became lost quickly. For example, you join a crowd of a handful of people who start having conversations about this person and that person and those events and these events. Unless you know the history or these people you become lost and confused easily. It seems as though the reader should be well knowledgable of the time period and lineage to truly understand the politics of it. I have to admit I get bored quickly with a book that does not have tragity in it. I really could not put the book down and also admit I did cry a couple times. The writer does a good job of describing places. Highly recommend it."
5,The journey begins....,"My name is Lynn and I'm a Richard III addict.And it's all the fault of this book and Anne Easter Smith. I purchased this book because, although I love reading about the Middle Ages and the English monarchy, I realized how little I knew about Richard III -- and thought the book, while fiction, might enlighten me a bit.Well, it did. And also lightened my pocketbook because it started me on a journey down a road where I have purchased numerous books about Richard III (fiction and non-fiction) and even joined the Richard III society.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who's interested in that time period. It's well-written but not ponderous -- a good read -- and, along with SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR (Sharon Kaye Penman) a good place to start on a Ricardian journey!Loyaultie me lie!!"
3,Not bad ... but not great,"A pro-Richard III view of the War of the Roses as told by Richard's mistress. The auitor did some good research but is not quite as good at weaving it into a story that you don't want to put down as Sharon Penman - her ""Sunne In Splendour"" novel is the better by far!"
3,A bit long for the story it told...,"I don't even know where to begin with this.I guess I will say that it was interesting to see a different perspective on King Richard III, and the book was researched and written well enough to make me want to believe that THIS, not the other, terrible things written about him, is his true story. Although while part of me is glad that Ms. Smith was true to history, I have *just* enough of a romantic soul to wish that Richard had continued his true love affair with Kate even once he was married to Anne, or at least picked back up with it in the short time between Anne's death and his own death.Overall, this book was good, but I also felt it was a little long and drawn out. I liked it but won't go naming it as one of my favorites."
3,A LITTLE ON THE OVER RATED SIDE,"Well this was a fine read but it started out slow, thicken in the middle, and was slow to the end. I found it a bit on the dull side yet I was facinated at the same time. I know the author was trying to tell the story about Kate growing up and her afair with Richard I think she spent too much time on everything else and lost the emphasis on the main focal point. I think she could have shortened the story quite a bit. I don't belive it needed to be 600 pages to get the point across I think she could have done that in about 400 or less. It was a wonderful read once she got on with the story but she lost my attention in the end. I might try to finish the book, but I put the book down in the last 200 pages."
3,More sappy romance than historical fiction,"I read a lot of historical fiction centered on the Tudor and post-Tudor periods. I enjoyed learning something about the War of the Roses and the period leading up to Tudor times. I agree with another reviewer who stated that she wished the fiction had been more historical. Yes, the background is historically accurate, but the romance (as Ms. Smith admits) is mostly invented. I would have enjoyed the story so much more if it hadn't so frequently read like a sappy romance novel. And, for some reason, I often found myself confused by all of the similar names and titles of the characters (but that may just be a fault of my own). In general, I thought it was a pleasant, interesting and fast read; worth a try."
5,the best of the post punk,"howard devoto was a genius, and was critisized for leaving the buzzcocks...he did not need the abc love songs of the cocks and moved on...magazine jumped ahead of all of the punk/new wave bands in england...circa..1977-1979..great music, way ahead of its time..this stuff is classic...the collection of musicians on this lp is legendary...enuff said...buy this CD...incredible music..esecially for fans of early punk/early new wave....mike from boston"
3,Experimental Film That's Not Wholly Successful,"""The Blockhouse"" is a film rife with good intentions but, alas, good intentions do not a great film make. It is noble of the filmmakers to portray men in a desperate situation trying to maintain their spirits and sanity. That said, even at the 92 minutes that the film clocks in at it's difficult for the viewer to retain their spirits let alone interest. Director Clive Rees films the men trapped in an underground bunker in natural candlelight and it appears that he allows his international cast, led by Peter Sellers, to improvise with no music to cue our emotions. In this regard the film is only marginally successful. It's not to say that this cannot be effective. Some may laugh, but think of Tom Hanks in Robert Zemeckis' ""Castaway"". As for Peter Sellers, some may think this is a vanity project for him but it's anything but. Sellers is effectively subdued in a rare dramatic role for him and graciously shares the screen with his supporting cast."
2,"A true story deserving of a documentary, not a film.","Peter Sellers delivers a fine performance, as do all of the other actors. It's an amazing, important, TRUE story, that deserves to be told. However, the method in which the director has chosen to convey the story, leaves a lot to be desired.Material for a great documentary? Absolutely! A rewarding viewing experience as a film? I'm afraid not."
2,a long wait,"Took a hell of a long time to arrive at destination ! Very happy with the book, second hand but in very reasonable conditions for a very cheap price but very high cost for its shipping and delivery, higher than expected !"
4,Reality,I think this is a documentary that will help people open the mind to understanding and knowing what this game is about.
5,Truth and fiction are strangers...,"This documentery plays out more like a well executed 'docu-spoof'. I still find myself thinking, ""Was that real?, could it of possibly been real?"" The dark synbiosis between the 'users' and the 'used' of humanity is highlighted in this incredible production. There is some kind of underlying wisdom, to every aspect of pimp-dom that causes the viewer to gain a slight understanding into the underlying world of illegal prostitution and into the further underlying world of pimps."
4,Real Ghetto Fabulus,This is worth checking out from player to player Pimp to pimpi'm waiting for a follow up!The hughes Bro. let you be the judge. Only set backs were themisc. cutaways between the true pimp episodes.
1,THIS IS NOTHING BUT DOO DOO,"In the 1800's, the Chinese put their women in the brothels to help make it in America. The Chinese men or the ""pimps"" calledthemselves the TONG. Well the Chinese here in America ain't doingthat anymore, so why are Black people STILL pimping and ""ho-ing""?I DO NOT OWN THIS PIECE OF DOO DOO! I RENTED IT!! In this age of enlightenment there is just no more reason or excuse for the ""game"". This is just another film about punked-out Black males making excuses for their incorect behaviour. PUNKED OUT;thesystem is wrong so they take it out on our daughters, sisters andmothers, PUNKED OUT. I hope that Blacks who watch this DVD willteach their daughters to be strong as to not fall into no pimptrap. Teach your sons to be REAL MEN. An example being JUDGE JOEBROWN. Don't buy this DVD, rent it! Have a bullet with the pimpsname on it!"
4,to a street corner near you:,"This is a bad-ass fun movie; do not waste your time at movies like The Patriot, or Scary Movie. This is the one. MOY. The best soundtrack, you get to hang out w/ self-proclaimed mutha f---as, and Pimpin' ain't easy, it's a business. You have to be a businessman, man. I only give it 4 stars because I can't be too on their jocks, but these boys (the Hughes) make movies I'm proud of. I'm proud of you, boys. Plus T. Shaw's in the movie! Go ahead. See it. Prove me wrong."
5,The best I've seen.,"This is the best of the hydrotherapy books that I was able to find at the National Institute of Health Library in Washington, DC."
3,Watch out for printing error in this edition.,"There isn't a lot I can add to other customer reviews of this novel. It's not Block at his best, but enjoyable enough--although if you haven't figured out the 'surprise' finish by the end of chapter seven you're not paying attention!My main reason for posting is to draw attention to a major printing error in the mass-market paperback edition. Page 258, smack in the middle of chapter sixteen, is completely blank in my copy (it would happen right at the climax!). So be sure to check your copy for this defect as soon as you receive it."
2,"Boring, prepetual words take reader on a superficial ride","While the novel has its moments, it surely was not what gave Lawrence Block his big name. The plot is very ""on the surface"" and quick, possibly too quick. More could have been done with character development, and a more played out resolution could have been made. The detective Scudder could have had more dimensions to his personality, and more could have been added about the details of his ""relationship"" with his ex-wife and also more on how his hardened personality came to be. Hopefully, some of his later Scudder novels were written better."
3,Fairly obvious conclusion,Well written but less wow than hoped for. He has great character development and I related to the realistic situations he portrayed.
4,The first Matthew Scudder masterpiece.,"It's so much fun to re-read a masterpiece. Feels like you're reading it for the first time. I LOVE the Matthew Scudder series. Here we have pre-recovery Scudder, pre-marriage (to one of the characters in this book; not to spoil it for newbies).I find the writing so intimate, even, at times, poetic. You get into the character's guts...and heart. Right up there with James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series. Lawrence Block is a treasure."
2,Sins of the fathers,"This book was predictable. I thought it would be more gritty and have a twist, but I was disappointed. I'm not sure I want to read another book by Block."
4,The Sins of the,This is the first time I read this author. My purchase was based on reading reviews from other customers. I enjoyed this book and have purchased more of his books. It is well written and he develops his characters.
4,"Gritty, violent and flawed, Matthew Scudder is to NY what Spencer is to Boston.","If you have mourned the passing of Robert B. Parker, miss his Spencer, Matthew Scudder may ease the loss. I am very happy to discover Lawrence Block's characters. Where have I been living, in a cave? I love reading the early years, the clothes, the decor, the hair. Thanks for many hours of entertainment in advance."
3,review,The book was good but the first of the series was better. I have this author on my list for future buying.
1,a whole lot of nothing,i dont know how anyone could give this anything close to five stars. it is very slow very boring very descriptive . i gave up less than half way. i do not recommend.
3,great in the beggining...,This book did not overly impress me. I found myself looking back to remember characters and storyline. Good idea bit wasn't overly impressed.
5,Borderlines/ Joe Gunther a great read,Archer Mayor is a gifted writer. Mayor writes concisely but with great eloquence. The mystery series is wonderful and I am hooked. I read is first book over Christmas as a freebie on my Kindle Fire and have since purchased this book and plan to order each book in the series. I am happy that I found this series. I enjoy M.C. Beaton for a quick read but I enjoy this for a bit of a longer read.
5,Hard to Put Down,"Just when you think you have it all figured out, Joe stumbles across something new, gets himself into a jam, and everything heads off in a new direction. Great characters and fascinating story lines keep my Kindle at my side, ready for any opportunity to read a few more pages."
3,Easy read mystery,"I enjoyed the second book in this series. It's easy to read, flows well and has a good story line."
5,Excellent pregnancy aid,This is my second pregnancy and both times I was in a great deal of discomfort...so much so that I couldn't walk some days.This prenatal cradle has made a world of difference and allowed me to enjoy my pregnancy. I highly recommend it. The only downside is that the straps do sometimes show when you're wearing an open neck shirt.
5,"Awesome, nothing but great","I bought this for pretty severe varicosities. It gave me instant relief. I am so happy with this purchase, and hate to take it off. Def worth the 50 bucks..."
2,Didn't fit properly,"I was so excited to find this product due to much pressure and discomfort in my third pregnancy. However, I ended up needing to return it. It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps, except the one strap that goes under your belly. This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable. I definitely couldn't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat, but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product. Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works. My only suggestion would be, if you are a slightly bigger girl, try ordering one size larger than you think. I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size. Anyhow, it was worth a try. Now if I can just find something else. This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman."
2,impractical to get on and off,"when youre pregnant and needing to use the bathroom every 30 minutes, the last thing you want to do is unstrap an entire body device. also, i got this for pelvic girdle pain and not varicose veins, but it didnt help with the pelvic pain for anyone who is looking to get it for the same reason."
3,Wife used it for a little bit,"The concept was great and we had owned one of these before, but my wife could not ger comfertable with this one. The straps were too thin."
1,Looked good.....,We purchased this thinking it would alieviate some back aches and other issues but once we put it on my wife she felt it was too much pressure and almost a digging in sensation. Would not recommend.
3,support me,"I have back pains, lower abdomen pressure (since I'm carrying my baby low) and the vulvar pressure; mainly after being on my feet for awhile. So far this contraption isn't what I'd hoped. Perhaps its too big and not holding me well enough yet. I did purchase it with room to grow in mind, but its not loose; yet I feel more comfort from the V2 pull up and a belly belt. The cradle plus is NOT something to wear if you are wearing anything other than a scoop necked shirt and its a hassle to get in and out of for the frequent restroom visits, (especially while out and about, which is when I need it most). I am 6mos and have gained 33lbs already, so though I am trying to slow it down big time, I have hope that one day this will be the support it appeared to be when I purchased it. Definitely not there yet. Not adjustable (except the straps around the behind, and I don't need to switch that, but it'd be nice to get a better lift in the front based on comfort and support need."
3,So-so first Sylvian solo album,"Things are pretty dead in Sylvians first solo effort after the delicate ""Oil on Canvas"" final-tour live album from Japan. The first few tracks ""Pulling punches"", ""The Ink in the Well"", and ""Red Guitar"" are very promising, melodic tracks, but this album is definately a case of parts are greater than the whole. Basically, the problem is that the rest of the album is weighed down by dull, slow tracks that seem to go on forever. It wasn't until future albums ""Gone to Earth"" and ""Secrets of the Beehive"" that Sylvian introduced compelling melodies that keep one's interest after repeated listening."
3,Nothing special,"Sylvian may look down on his own work with Japan, but there's no denying that his Japan albums are more interesting to listen to, both in terms of music and lyrics. Brilliant Trees is pleasant enough, but the lyrics are excruciatingly banal, and Sylvian's voice has lost its special quality. And if I wanted innocuous jazz-funk noodling I'd have bought Sting's solo albums - they're certainly no more boring than Brilliant Trees."
2,The Warning: Don't buy this,"I randomly chose to buy and listen to this CD because they are playing at Coachella. It isn't good. It reminds me of StereoLab but without talent. Each song is more insipid and boring than the last. The music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine, irritating electonic blips, guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless. Needless to say...I don't get it."
4,a great album,"the harmonies that go on here are what really propel this album. Electronics are wondrful too, but it's the vocal play that keeps this album out of generic electro, and pushes into it's own category. One of the few albums that's both immediately infectuous, yet has long lasting appeal. Which is altogether too rare these days. Well worth the purchase."
4,Interesting...,"I bought this CD after stumbling across Hot Chip's other album 'Coming On Strong'. I really liked that one, but 'The Warning' just doesn't flow as well. Hot Chip's style of music is like a balancing act between chaos and creativity and will appeal to different people in different ways. Love it or hate it...at least it's something unique and different."
5,Great sport headphones,"I got 2 pair of these very cheap on [...]. The intent was to use them for working out, and then throw them away when they died. The first pair made it almost an entire year of being drenched 3-4 times a week! I sweat alot, and these were definitely put through the paces.The sound is amazingly good, which I didn't expect for the price. I have tried in-ear buds, but the sound just wasn't comparable to these. I'd get these again in a second."
4,"Civilizations, UFO's, and Other Complexities of the Universe","""Ancient Archeology"" with Kathleen Andersen, a writer for ""Ufologist Magazine"", narrates her exploration into UFO sightings, experiences, and parallels to strange complexities of the Universe. She explains where the phrase ""flying saucer"" first originated and how it became a generalization for UFOs. Her documentation is thorough and the information about ancient civilizations is interesting. Through her research, she uncovers evidence in ""The Big Foot Valley"" of alien visitors, and discusses the ""common characteristics"" among people who have ET abduction experiences. Do aliens favor one ethnicity over another when choosing who to abduct? This documentary identifies the group most often abducted!"
3,Unexplained Findings in Bigfoot Valley,"Anderson is a freelance writer who lives in the Pacific Northwest, and has studied, among other things, unexplained findings in the Bigfoot Valley. She says she studies mythology, holy books, and archeology in relation to UFOs and Planet X. Unfortunately, this lecture raises a lot of questions, but explores little evidence of answers. This DVD is one in a series of lectures filmed at the 2003 International Scientific and Metaphysical Symposium in Brisbane, Australia."
1,Yawn or just have someone knock you out,"I could not even finish this documentary, it was so boring that I could not handle more than 10 minutes. If you could congrads you must have been on some kind of drug unlike myself."
5,AWESOME,"This was so accurate & great for families to see, must see for kids & adults alike. I even bought it for my pastor for Christmas this year."
2,Learning America's Heritage,"Unfortunately this was an older version of America's Godly Heritage, with a much younger David Barton doing the narration. After receiving it and realizing that it was not what I wanted, I was able to look more carefully and found the new version on Wall Builders website. The content and quality of the older version was fine, it was just not what I was expecting."
5,"Well produced, very interesting, very informative.","I had seen this movie once before several years ago, and decided to purchase it. We showed it to our Boy Scout troop to fulfill a merit badge requirement. It is well produced, very interesting, and very informative. I give it the highest recommendation. It closely documents the evidence revealing how our country was founded upon Christian priniciples, and how that heritage has been gradually hidden through the years."
4,History discovered,Best American history lesson I have ever heard. I have always before doubtful about the Separation of church and state. This DVD exposes the fact that American history has been altered. Really worth watching.
2,Not what I expected,"I have seen some stories of how faithful our founding country fathers were. I wanted to hear the stories again more from the first person perspective. This was a lecture of how our country has drifted away from the constitution. Some or many lawyers and black rob judges have become so radical and liberal minded they have turned their back on the principals of the founding fathers, I agree totally with what this says and it is more a challenge to our generation to wake up and realize how perverted our legal system and judges and politicians who are almost all lawyers too, have become. so I hope this helps you understand what you are buying better than I did. It is a shame that some how we let one man who smoke pop all though college (Now wears a black rob) over turn what millions of people have worked on and voted on. It was never intended by our founding fathers."
1,Chaotic and badly organized,"In the interest of full disclosure, I in no way agree with Barton's arguments or methodology, but these issues have been thoroughly dealt with by Barton's many critics. My issue here is presentation; agree or disagree with Barton, how can anyone argue that he presents his case well? His narrative careens wildly from point to point, randomly touching on a point here and there, before zooming off in another direction. Lengthy digressions appear out of nowhere, sometimes serving a purpose, but sometimes serving only to derail whatever point he his trying to make. I haven't read Barton's books (nor do I intend to) but if his writing is as badly-organized as his narrative in this DVD, I have great pity for those who attempt to plow through the pages. Nobody deserves that kind of suffering."
1,History? More like Propaganda!,"This was actually PAINFUL to watch! It's billed as a historical documentary, but it strays far away from actual documented history and engages in historic revisionism and outright LIES about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers of the United States of America.Upon further research it turns out the director does not have any background in history. David Barton CLAIMS to be a historian, however his ""higher education"" consists only of a Bachelor of Arts degree in religious education from Oral Roberts University. He has no academic qualifications in history whatsoever.Barton has been described, by Arlen Specter (among others), as being a pseudohistorian, and his work has been criticised by REAL historians including Richard V. Pierard."
1,Quick review,"This is the religious right ignoring and/or twisting historical facts, making things up, and spewing propaganda."
2,There is much better out there,"Unfortunately Barton is a GOP financed, conservative political activist with a Christian fundamentalist mission. A much better source with far better customer reviews is: Founding Faith: Providence, Politics, and the Birth of Religious Freedom in America by Steven Waldman. Just read the content of the that product's reviews compared to that of Barton's reviewers."
3,inviting but not satisfying,"I picked up this book after seeing the Hesse retrospective in San Francisco. Although it provides a lot of useful background, the reading the art are somehow too pat. I guess it is a problem to always refer to the artist's life, however fascinating, to explain their work? And the 'feminist' framework did seem forced -- the photos were very suggestive but the author seemed afraid to really go for it. Why is so much academic writing afraid to make a strong argument or provocative, unexpected analysis?"
3,well-reviewed feminist art criticism,"Everyone who reviewed it seemed to love this overview of the careers of 3 artists: Krasner, Hesse. It's a fun read, with great photos, but I wish art historians would start to see there's more to the sixties than Hesse: what about Agnes Martin, Lee Bontecou, Yoko Ono, Alison Knowles, and all the rest??Wagner wants to be a good feminist, but ultimately, her approach is surprisingly traditional: canonical figures, marriage plot, sticks to the US, the known and alrady successful. Wants to avoid being ""radical"" or disturbing at all costs."
2,disappointing account of three artists,"Wagner presents 3 kay artists but her analysis is thin -- after 200+ pages, we get to the conclusion that ""altho gender doesn't entirely determine our lives, it does inflect them..."" or something like that. Seems to be totally unaware of feminist work on modernism in other fields (ie lit, film) and never questions the whole ""marriage"" (heterosexuality) framework she sets up. As a trade press book, it'd be fine, but as a university press book -- seems thin, uninformed."
1,Noisey,I just received my fan and it makes as much noise as an electric tooth brush. The shipping casts almost as much as the fan so I guess I'll tear it apart to try to fix it.
4,Great Item,"This sturdy little fan has been working well for months. One quibble: its two speeds are medium & fast. There is no ""slow."" Overall, I'm a happy customer."
2,Cheap Fan,Works great for a while but then has tendency to start slowing down. Ok I guess for small office area but not a reliable fan
4,Good Fans,"The fans were the perfect size and type for my application, auxilliary cooling for my media center computer and external hard drives. They are just a little noisier than I like, but not prohibitively so. All-in-all a solid purchase."
4,Great little fan,"Fan works pretty well. Its not too loud at all and the clip is nice and sturdy.I took a star off because of the way you turn it on. It is a dial on the back of the motor that you have to turn. While this works great in the upright position of the fan, if you position the fan so it faces directly up, the dial gets moved behind the bracket, making it less convenient to turn on and off. For me I have it positioned so its always in the position that the dial is inconvenient.Not that big of a deal but I found it enough to earn it 4 stars. I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3,try another brand,broke 5 min after i started using it. took 2 hrs to put it back together. don't put much air out.
5,The perfect desk fan.,"This little fan is just perfect! It is quiet and I can clip it anywhere. Plus, it has a generous range of positions once you do have it clipped in. The slow speed is pleanty enough to provide a nice cool breeze."
2,Extremely bad sound transmit ion,"The Sound is horrible. I thought that the problem was with the speakers. I bought a new pair of jbl.The sound didn't improve, so I taught that the problem was with the zune, but it was weird because when I was using the headphones the sound of the zune was amazing.So I tried to connect directly the zune to the JBL speakers and the sound was incredible crisp.The only reason I'm giving this crappy dock 2 stars it is because I can still use the remote control otherwise the $65 were gone derectly to the garbage."
3,I like it,"As others have said, this unit does suck up batteries. According to the manual, however, you can put a rechargable battery and charge via the USB connector (not sure if that is accurate but that is what is implied). I would have liked some better folder management on the unit. As others have said, it is hard to read without the back light.Overall I like the unit, it has nice sound, works well, and is pretty solid. A good update to the built in software would fix a lot of my issues."
3,Seeming to malfunction,"I cannot record any music to the player, because my computer isnot reconizing it. Therefore I cannot use it."
5,The best Indian cookbook I have ever used,"With this little gem of a cookbook, you will establish your reputation as an outstanding curry chef. The quick-to-execute, gheeless recipes are virtually foolproof. (Go easy on the chilis and the cayenne, however.) I have tried for years to make Indian food and always failed. Now I'm so proud of myself I want to show off my beautiful meals at every opportunity. And I don't particularly like to cook. The mushroom curry and the chicken Dahnsak are to die for!"
5,been looking for this book since2002,I had this cook book long time ago and it got destroyed. I have been looking for it ever since . I love this cookbook
5,Ordinary French recipes with real flair,"A cookbook that gives exceptional treatment to ordinary recipes, French or American. Dishes are mostly from the 19th century, using tricks that originated in the country and found their way to the city for authentic French style. Dione Lucas adds a special flair to the recipes that is sure to delight your guests. The book also includes instructions in many techniques that make brilliant French chefs out of all of us."
3,A great classic - somewhat dated,"I have had Dione's book for 15 years on my shelves, and have consulted it many times. The recipes are all very classical, and require, in most cases, long, intricate, preparations. There was a time when I would look up her recipe first before composing my own in the kitchen (mine would be faster and easier...), just to make sure that I would not miss an essential part.In the end, over the past 6 or 7 years I have progressively dropped that habit and now refer to newer compendia. In most cases, Dione' recipes are too complex, often for no reason (my simplifications did not seem to make them any worse). In addition, there are many original ingredients that could not be obtained in Dione's time, but are now quite common: her substitutions don't make as much sense as they used to. I think that this book is most useful for someone who would want a reference text on how people used to cook French in the US."
4,Inexpensive does the job,"Not really much to say here. It's an inexpensive replacement filter that fits and does it's job.The only small wrinkle I had was that for some reason, the models listed in the Amazon listing don't exactly match the models on the box I received. The filter still fit properly, but I found it odd that my model wasn't listed on the box (HAP 240, not 2400). Was it a typo? Was it a lazy listing by the person who created this? Not really sure, and I guess I don't really care all that much, thus the 4 stars."
4,Had it for 6 years,I had the same unit HAP243 for last 6 years and it still runs. It's on the noisier side though.
3,thought it was a 2 pack,"Its a filter, unfortunately its just one of them. A little overpriced for a single filter. Bionaire makes cheaper replacements."
5,Timely and as expected,I needed the filter form my Holmes air purifier. It was the correct type and was delivered in a timely fashion.
5,High quality affordable filters,These are high quality affordable filters for my Holmes air purifier. Even my pets sneeze less when the purifier is running! The filters really help to keep the air in our house cleaner!
4,Good product on time,"recieved product on time, universal filter, so had to adjust brackets, works well, and at a reasonable price, thanks thanks"
4,"Good function, good style.",This bag has plenty of space and a good combination of pockets without having too many. The handle is particularly well designed with its snap-together clasp. Very good bag.
5,convenient gym bag,Great gym bag and perfect size. I like how there is a zip up area on the side where you can store sneakers.
4,OGIO Crunch Duffel Bag,"i bought the red duffel bag for an overnight bag, and it definitely suited my needs just fine. this bag is bigger than it looks, it expands when you fill it. i like the handy shoe compartment on the side (the shoes will take up room inside the main compartment even though it is separated by the inner bag). not a whole lot of extra pockets (none inside), but it is a duffel bag after all. the strap pad makes it comfortable to carry over the shoulder. i found the locking handgrips to be pretty useless, because they're made to just stack on each other and ""lock"" together, but they kept coming back apart every time i lifted the bag with the shoulder strap. overall nice bag, fairly heavy duty, lightweight, good gym bag or airline carryon."
4,Great Bag!,"I recommend this to anyone looking for a GYM bag that uses it for a set of clothes to change into and a separate shoe compartment to keep your clothes contained from whatever you stepped in earlier. This bag is ideal for me to store in a smaller sized cube locker that is all that is available at the gym i belong to at this point in time. The handle is a bit awkward, but the bag seems to be good quality, and serves its purpose to bring back and forth to the gym while handling extra clothes, pocket extras, deodorant, an iPod, etc."
3,Very practical gym bag.,"It has just the right amount of pockets and a protective insert for the shoes. This makes it very convenient. The zippers are a little hard but time will tell. I also notice that on the end-flaps some black from the inside lining had leaked. It is not too noticeable, but it is enough to be a little disappointed when you buy a new article. Overall it is good value for the money."
3,It'll do,For the price it is a decent value - but a bit smaller inside than expected and the zippers are rough!
2,pockets tear on the inside,"I liked this bag until the inside pocket opposite the shoe compartment ripped. Now everything I put in this pocket (keys, phone, ring etc) ends up floating around the inside of the bag. the shoe compartment is great... and the bag is the right size but the torn pocket now makes it unusable. It worked for a about 6 months before it gave out."
4,Great bag,"Absolutely love this bag. And also arrive earlier than expected. Only 1 small cosmetic issue with the material, but nothing worth crying over. Overall over concrete buy."
4,Lots of room,Bag is very well designed. I like the separate shoe compartment that keeps dirty shoes away from the rest of your stuff. Carry handle is also very well designed. A little big for the lockers at my club.
5,The only bag to last me more than a year.,"Prior to purchasing this bag, I'd had numerous cheap (<$20) gym bags that would begin falling apart in less than a year's time. In particular, the linings would start to come apart in pieces. I've now had the OGIO Crunch for over a year and a half, and although it shows some exterior wear, I have no doubt that it will last at least another year, even with me overloading it on occasion.The shoe compartment is big enough for shoes considerably larger than my size 9s, and having an additional 2 compartments is enough for my toiletries and accessories. I would prefer a slightly larger bag, but 95% of the time, the Crunch is more than big enough for me. Be warned, if you have large feet/shoes (I work out in Vibram Five Fingers which don't take up much room), that will limit interior volume to some degree."
4,Ogio Crunch Pack review,"Great gym bag - holds a ton of stuff! I really like the separate compartment for my sneakers. The other side pocket is great for holding the toiletries I lug to and from the gym. The front pocket is great for my ipod, keys, gym card, etc. I've received a lot of compliments on this bag!"
4,Lots of room,"I was looking for a small bag to take to the gym during my lunch break...I need it to carry 2 pairs of sneaks (I carry a second pair for cycling), shower flip-flops and my gym clothes. The bag is not even half empty with this in it. Pros: it's very good quality; it's a duffle bag so it will scrunch up and fit in a locker; it has a side compartment for shoes; it has 2 more pockets for easy access to gym cards and water bottles. While it is bigger than what I was looking for, I am still happy with it and the separate storage area (for shoes or wet clothes) is a big plus."
2,"Not 24"" in length","The bag looks exactly like it does in the picture, but the provided dimensions are not accurate. The bag is more like 18 inches rather than the advertised 24 in length."
4,"Not as Big as I thought, but....","I recieved this item and immediately thought ""where's the rest of it??"" but it is smaller then I thought, but actually might be handy as a carry-on which would be nice! anyways I did like it and happy with my purchase overall."
2,good little bag but the quality has diminished.,"I previously owned an Ogio Transfer bag purchased from the same vendor. I work in the travel industry and found that particular bag to be way too big and so I would find myself over-packing and getting weighted down. So I bought this as it was smaller, still expecting the same quality. Well first when I opened the package I was disappointed as the color was not correct, but I'm not really picky so I kept it. The zipper on the seldom used front pocket is starting to get caught up and snag after just two months of use. The overall quality is lower than the previous Ogio bag, I don't know if they changed manufacturers or what? If you need a small travel bag, find another. If you can live with a bit larger bag forr the money, get the Ogio Transfer you'll be glad you did."
3,smaller than a I thought it would be,"This is a decent bag; my one complaint is that it is smaller than I anticipated. It you're planning on using it for a weekend travel, it's a little on the small side."
1,Awkward,"I got this after reading good reviews and wish I hadn't. The bag is too big, which makes it awkward to carry around. I don't need this much room in a gym bag, it's hard to carry it on the streets and in the subway. I will stick with my canvas bag."
3,a little disapointing but overall a good bag.,"I bought two of these bags for myself and the Fiance to use as gym bags. She got the red and i got the blue. After one day of use the blue bag developed a tear from the front pocket into the main bag compartment. C'mon this is only after one use! Whatever, I'm way to lazy to send it back for a replacement and this. So zippity doo daaa!"
2,not much to it,This bag looks nice but has very few features it is nothing like the Ogio bag I've had for years the shoe sleeve makes the inside cramped
1,gee it smells,This was a nice looking bag when I took it out of the plastic but wow did it smell. it smelled like oil or gasoline. What are they making these bags out of anyway??? I would never buy another bag from this company.Dont waste you money
2,"Definitely not 24"" long -only 19 1/2""","I bought this to hold some photo equipment, including some small light stands that are 21"" long but they don't fit. The description says the bag is 24"" (as does the manufacturer's tag that was attached when I got the bag) but it's only about 19 1/2"" long (exterior dimension using a measuring tape). I see now there's another review that mentions that it's not 24"" but I missed it before buying mine.It seems like a really nice bag with some good features and would have been perfect for my needs if it was just a little bit longer."
4,Good Bag. Description a little deceiving,"I started to workout almost daily so I needed to switch from my tote bag to something more substantial. I bought this one bcause the price was right and I liked the wasabi color. The bag has proven to be a good purchase. It's sturdy, has good straps, has a good number of compartments and I really like the inner compartment for shoes, wet and dirty clothes etc. It's bigger than what I wanted and the wasabi color is more lime than wasabi but all in all, I'm happy with my purchase and would recc this bag to others."
4,Nice but too small for our purposes.,"My husband bought this for our frequent beach trips. We are usually just gone over the weekend and the bag is too small. My husband doesn't pack much, we are the classic joke of me taking everything and him taking his toothbrush, but is still is too small. It's cute and well made. I know he would have kept it had it been bigger. Be sure to check the dimensions before you buy. It would be a great gym bag but not for packing."
3,Bought the orange one..returning for black one,"I ordered the orange version and I'm forced to return it due to defects in the bag. There are very odd black lines and streaks all over the inside of the orange nylon and it's sandwiched between the fabric and the inside rubber coating. In addition, the rubber inside coating looks very flimsy and I don't see it wearing well over the years. It starts to crack when you pinch it and is just either way too thin or not pliable enough. My bag also stinks of strong gasoline smell much like what others are experiencing. I'm re-ordering this bag in black in hopes I don't see this in the black version. I do like the overall size of the bag plus the convenient wet clothes / shoe compartment. The plastic handle attached to the straps is a nice touch, but executed wrongly. It's cumbersome to get the 2 pieces aligned together. I'll leave another review after receiving the black version."
5,NIce gym bag,"I like the durable material and the pockets in this bag. Fits nicely in a gym locker and fits everything that I need for the gym as well as change of clothes. I Iike that there are 3 separate pockets plus a main compartment because I needed to be able to separate dirty clothes from baby items since I take my baby to daycare at the gym and keep a change of clothes, diapers, etc. for him in my bag."
5,Awesome bag,"I got this bag as a birthday gift from my wife and it is absolutely the sturdiest, most versatile gym bag I've ever owned. Love the shoe pocket to keep my shoes away from my stinky wet gym clothes (or muddy shoes away from the rest of my gear) and the bag has more than enough room to carry everything I could need at the gym."
3,Nice bag but a little too small,"Bag is attractive, but it is too small for what I need--maybe useful for someone who goes to the gym but doesn't need to take change of clothes, towel and shower supplies."
2,Doesn't keep the shape.,The bag looks good. It has enough compartments that you would probably need for every day work out. The biggest problem i see with the bag is the bag does keep the shape.
1,Very flimsy - has no body,"I purchased this about 5 weeks ago and have been using it ever since. The bag itself has no body or form, including he bottom. When the bag is empty and on top of a table you have to support the sides and top just to fill it. My old bag had some rigidly to it so that when empty it filled up easy.Putting sweaty gym clothes in this bag is like putting a wet watermelon in a tight fitting plastic bag, very difficult. The bag itself is a great color with lots of compartments but it is otherwise useless. I tried to return it tonight but found out I was past my 30 day mark, which is my fault. So I'm stuck with it for a while until it pisses me off enough that I purchase another one. Don't buy this bag, there are plenty of good ones out there."
1,Bag smells like gasoline,Bag is nice size but smells so bad of gasoline or petroleum. That smell permeates clothing and you can smell it when the bag is in the car. Its horrible.
1,"Has an almost toxic smell to it and if you want to return it, they will charge you a restocking fee.","When I first received this gym bag, I was so excited. Until I opened it up and the smell of gasoline nearly knocked me out. I decided to use it anyway that day and it worked fine. However, the bag still reeked of gasoline so much, that I wrote to the company for suggestions. Waiting to hear back from them, I sealed the bag up with a box of baking soda in a Ziploc bag to get the smell out. That did not work and neither did trying to air it out (as they had suggested). Since neither worked, I am sending it back and they want to charge me a re-stocking fee for returning it. Wait, so you want to charge me a re-stocking fee for something that smells like an oil spill? This does not seem right."
2,Not to great,"This is way smaller then i was expecting it to be, and cheaply made. Probably works well for people who do not use it ofter, but not god for everyday use"
1,A Lengthy History of a Boring Man,"My first Jane Hamilton book, and from the reviews of Hamilton's other books, regretfully so. I don't have a problem with characters I don't particularly like, but I could barely stand Walter McCloud and his painfully bland and whiny disposition.It's clear Hamilton lacks a true connection with her character as the book drones on as she dwells on Mark's homosexuality and takes his desperation over his brother's death and beats the book into the ground. The plot has very little direction as the character flashes between adulthood and adolescence. All in all, very disappointing. I want to give Jane Hamilton's other books a read, but it may be awhile before I am able to get over the wasted time I spent on A Short History of a Prince."
3,Ehhhh...,"Jane Hamilton is my favorite contemporary author, but if you're looking for a great novel, read The Book of Ruth. ""Short History"" was good but nowhere near the caliber of work that Hamilton has twice proved she is capable of."
2,Who Talks Like This?,"The story would have been interesting if the dialogue had been more believable. But as it was written, nearly anything a character says in this novel becomes an incredible, insightful, three-paragraph-long monologue. You can get away with that in theater, but not in a ""realistic"" novel."
4,Excellent,"I was very wary of this book because so many of the reviews were negative. I decided to read it only because I found it cheap in a second hand store. I'm glad I did. I thought it a much better book than A Map of the World (the only other of hers I have read). The lead character is, at times, detached and lacking in warmth but the book, overall, was beautiful, thought provoking and incredibly sad. There is a line where Walter says he feels 'erased' by society. You don't have to be gay to understand that! At the end of the book he says something like ""I am among you"", and I thought, ""Yes, you are!"" For those who read for more than entertainment, this book comes highly recommended."
1,This book was about as entertaining as watching paint dry,"Possibly one of the most boring books ever written and I loved Hamilton's last two works. To the reader in Chicago, I understood the point of this book, it still doesn't mean that it was any good."
2,third novel disappointing,"Jane Hamilton has written two superb novels as everyone knows, The Book of Ruth and A Map of the World. This new one is very disappointing. The ""big wacky family"" exists solely in books like this one. The story is blah, not one character really moved me or stayed in my mind. And the central character is dull, pretentious to the max, not believable at any age. He leads the dullest life of a gay man I have ever read in any book. The only interesting thing was his sexual hijinks at age 15, and there wasn't enought of that! This book really is like a third rate TV movie of the week, only without a real theme. Skip this one!"
2,"Rough going, awkward structure","It was hard to keep moving through this one. The back and forth time structure becomes confusing and makes for a ponderous start. Characterization was excellent, I feel like I really got to know and like the characters as people, but there were many times when I wanted to just drop it out of frustration."
5,Outstanding Novel,"Jane Hamilton proves she is the ""real thing"" with her third novel. Once again all characters are fully realized and whole. The book deals excellently with denial then acceptance of the illness and death of a sibling and son and the long range impact of that on a family. It captures the warmth and love of an extended family as well as the dysfuctionality of that family. A book I couldn't put down."
1,Disappointing,"I couldn't stand the characters. There wasn't enough plot. I kept hoping the book would get better, but it never did. I despised the main character. He and all of the other characters lacked depth. Yuck! Waste of my time."
4,A relatable story!,"This story was very hard to get into. I almost put it down through the first 100 pages. After you get through the first 100 pages, the story is wonderful. I could relate very well to the charcter. I as a gay teen, have felt and feel a lot of the things walter feels. My favorite part of the story is his obession with Mitch.I recommend the story as long as you can get through the first 100 pages."
1,Thoroughly Anticlimactic.,A profound disappointment. Particularly so if you expected the same brilliance she delivered with her two previous novels. This story lacked the insightfulness and poignancy that both A Map of the World and The Book of Ruth were absolutely rich with.
2,Great cure for insomnia,"I am an avid reader and rarely leave a book unfinished. I am half way through this one and am finding it extremely difficult to finish. I'm trying to force myself to read ten pages a night but usually fall asleep after a couple. Jane Hamilton is one of my favorite writers. I absolutely loved Map of the World and Book of Ruth. Map of the World is one of the best books I have ever read. I was so excited when I found this in the bookstore and grabbed it anticipating another life changing book. What a disappointment! Although it makes some good points, I feel they could be made in one or two chapters, this seems to plod along going nowwhere. Maybe it will pick up and I'll be pleasantly surprised? I am going to try to continue to plod through it but I am not connecting with any of these characters."
3,"Not a drop-everything read, but characters have merit","Jane Hamilton has, if not outdone her earlier, more splashy works, done a servicable job looking into the heart of longing, regret, and love. I thought the two main characters were well done, but longed for more background on some of the secondary characters, especially the mysterious Sue Rawson.Also, I felt that the characters' speaking voices were forced and unrealistic. They all seemed to have the same devil-may-care tonality and knowingness that may have been right for one character, but not for all! It is especially evident in the high-school scenes, but is true across both time periods.Last, why mask Oak Park as Oak Ridge, IL? Every other Chicago location is finely drawn. I found that strange."
4,cheap but usable,"I just received my WFR certification and wanted to stock my first aid kit with cravats (triangular bandages). Rather than making them, I thought I'd pick up this inexpensive box of 12 cravats. They are extremely thin and loosely-woven, to the point of seeming like tulle, but appear sturdy. For the price compared to the other cravats I looked at, these are good. Although I should've just gone to the local craft store and bought a length of fabric and cut it into 40x40x56 triangles, for the ease of buying, these are okay."
5,Really handy to have around,"As a veteran will know, there are so many uses for this triangular bandage. Especially handy for outdoors oriented people. Great to have in the vehicle, at the camp or in the 1st aid kit."
4,as promised,"I recieved the product as advertised in a timely fashion .It is in new condition. Fortunately, I have not had to test its use yet."
2,Scary Music,"Secondhand Daylight is full of eeire songs that sound like they should be on the soundtrack of a distrubing movie. The exception is Rhythm of Your Cruelity which is magazine at their best. Songs like Permafrost, Back to Nature, and Feed the Enemy would go well in darkrooms used to sacrifice chickens."
4,Great memory for stock and OC applications,"This memory is excellent to run at both the advertised speed of 1066 Mhz and to overclock. This is thanks to the excellent Micron chips they use which can be pushed hard for OC applications. Of course you can also get a much cheaper 800 Mhz or even a 667 Mhz memory stick with the same Micron chips and overclock them to 1066 Mhz or beyond, but these offer lifetime warranty even if you push the voltage upto 2.35V and they have excellent ""Platinum"" heat spreaders on the sticks."
3,"Good Price, But...","The modules are a great price, and OCZ has a good reputation, but there seems to be some kind of ""conflict"" between OCZ modules and some newer motherboards. Check OCZ's forums. The error I get at every boot is ""SPD missing byte 23 or 25"". OCZ and my motherboard maker (Foxxconn) both blame each other. OCZ has proposed a fix which is available in the forums, but it involves flashing in a new SPD."
2,"Good reference, poor for beginners","I began learning about hardware design with this book. Now I use it for reference.But for beginners, this is not a very good book. Although hardware design is somewhat difficult to explain, the book does not analyze subjects in detail or how circuits work. When it does try to explain topics, it does not do so clearly and provides few examples. Unless you have outside help (such as a teacher, professor, teaching assistant, etc.), I would definitely recommend finding another book to learn about hardware design because you will struggle while trying to figure out how things work (if you are a novice)."
2,Difficult to use,"I suffered immensely trying to use this textbook. The author, while knowledgeable in the field, writes in pedantic, verbose technical jargon full of recursive definitions and unhelpful examples. Often, examples just show a completed procedure without bothering to go over the steps necessary to arrive at the answer. The absence of answers for end-of-chapter exercises is maddening. For autodidacts and instructors alike, I recommend looking elsewhere for material that aims to instruct rather than to dryly spit out facts with negligible explanations."
1,"If you want something detailed, this book ain't it","This book is very ""bare"" when and it doesn't offer enought examples. This book is difficult to understand and takes deciphering the material takes many tedious hours. Therefore, I would like to conclude by saying this is absolutly the worst text book that was ever written."
1,A Book Not To Read,"This book is absolutely horrible. The Professor who teaches this class with this book HE WROTE, is utterly dispicible because of his teaching ability. This professor, at UC Irvine does not know the one bit in teaching a COMPLICATED subject like Digital Systems to a class who has had little to no experiece with this type of work. I hope this book is revoked for any reason, and hope that professor reads this review in order to gain some knowledge about the way he is teaching a class of Engineers in an era where knowledge is not automatically achieved, rather taught by knowledgable instructors."
2,Tell your teacher to get another book!,"I used this book for an introductory logic design class. I was able to learn from it, but it was difficult. The teacher didn't even use it much. The book was not well written and hard to understand. I recommend learning from another book."
2,"A theory, a theory, my kingdom for a theory.","Forced to develop a theory to support their goal of cutting taxes without eliminating any significant portion of the welfare state, left-Republicans like Jack Kemp turned to this fellow. I bought it for a while in my early 20s, too. Mea culpa. It turns out that economic growth and balanced budgets are -- horrors! -- not mutually exclusive. Sorry, Jude."
1,"Hey, Jude!","While this book may be described as 'entertaining' and 'easy to understand', Wanniski's ideas do not hold water. Running an economy solely on supply-side lines is a discreditied concept, and for the publishers claim that this book paved the way for 20 years of unparalleled prosperity is totally preposterous. While the idea of an academic upstart (ie. a theorist without the traditional background, who faces attack from mainstream intellectuals) is a romantic one, the theories they produce will not always be accurate."
3,Landon Snow book,I sent this book to my granddaughter who is 8 years old and my husband said that she would probably like it when she is a bit older. I told him I felt it was adventures more for a boy and he disagrees with me. So I guess we will have to wait to see. We got her the whole series and hopes she will enjoy reading them when she is a bit older.
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this watch 6 months ago, wearing it daily cleaning it off with water most nights to keep it nice and new looking because I wanted to wear this watch for a long time. Well, after 6 months it is totally stained, it's got blue and black stains all around the band. It went a from a pretty rose color to a nasty looking purple/black color in places. It's cute if you just want to wear it every-so-often but that's not typically why people choose a watch like this."
2,BLKMOVCOL1,"Story line was good. Happy to see a young Richard Prior at his best, as well as the other African-American stars at their peak during this time. The quality of the picture was'nt that great, but you need this in your collection if you are a serious collector of ""Blackpotation"" movies. Enjoyed it never the less"
3,"Good, clear, portrayal of the loyalists in Northern Ireland","First and foremost, the introduction was very sad but made me keep reading. Although my sympathies lie more in the nationalist camp, through reading this book I was able to comprehend why the loyalists have done things like the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in '74. Taylor does a wonderful job of showing that in a conflict such as that in Northern Ireland, no one is innocent, and people feel forced to do things that they would never do under normal circumstances. I would have liked to have seen more about the loyalist splinter groups, as well as the UDA's connection to Combat 18, which is a British neo-Nazi group, but those are tiny little nit-picky details in a much wider conflict. Like his book on the IRA, Taylor has done massive amounts of research and interviews with this book. I feel sorry for the people who have died in this conflict in the past 33 years, and Taylor has shown me why I feel that way."
3,a fairly good book but not as good as behind the mask,"this book is pretty acurate and describes the attempt by prodestent paramilitaries to emulate the better trained and equiped IRA and to be as ruthless as the INLA which they manage with some success to do.this book also shows the lack of leadership and orginazation within loyalist groups which allowed the IRA to survive repeated attacks upon themselves by groups such as the UVF and UFF/UDA while at the same time assasinating protestent terrorists and british security forces, and in the process becoming the largest best trained terrorist organization in europe. it also details the involvement of british intelligence in sacraficing the protestent and catholic people of northern ireland by training loyalists and not combating them or the IRA effectively."
1,muck-raking drivel,"this book is drivel. protestants may be mean and nasty, but they are not murderers; they are just defending their Britishness and their British way of life."
5,"Wonderful, practical book","Great book for those of us who know we need to eat well and exercise, but just need a little more. She is easy to read and understand. I love the way she layed out each tip with what to do, why, and how much you'll lose over a year by doing this. It's so easy to find simple things that you can do to help lose weight from her long list of things to try. And it works, I lost weight right away just by doing a couple of new things. I highly recommend this book!"
5,i tried diet simple-it works!,"Diet Simple provides what all of us lumbering Baby Boomers need: a completely practical guidebook to gradually and painlessly lose weight without completely overhauling our lives. I lost 15 pounds over a few months by trying Katherine's suggestions to substitute fruit for Snickers bars, eating grilled chicken rather than fried chicken, and cooking her great gourmet meals on the weekends and bringing them into work. This book is solid, practical and concrete. Everyone should read it."
5,"Whimsical, a little silly and wonderful","What a wonderful, fantastical book! Although there were parts I found troubling (why did everyone seem to have affairs?) the writing was so delightful I couldn't get enough. Well-crafted and brilliantly edited, it was like an interlocking puzzle of whimsy and delight. I can't wait to find out if the author has written more novels!UPDATE: Oooh! She does have other books, including The Spell Book of Listen Taylor, which is sort of a retelling of I Have a Bed Made of Buttermilk Pancakes with more focus on the character of twelve-year-old Listen. The only thing is that it's apparently more aimed at a young adult audience, like a lot of her other books seem to be. Would I still enjoy it? I'm not sure, but I'd definitely give it a go!For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
5,One of the Best,"My copy of this cookbook is falling apart, from age and use. It's yellowed pages are so fragile I will have to replace it with perhaps a later printing. There are so many wonderful recipes in here. Though the recipes are slightly complex, they are not impossible, they just take time and patience. They are not for the quick meal after a long day at work, but great for a weekend when there is time. If you are lucky enough to have a good Indian grocery store in your area, the spices are available, and the resulting food is divine."
5,My favorite spy,"I've been a fan of Matt Helm since my high school days--too many years gone by now to admit to. This is the story of Matt Helm a WW II vet who worked in counterintelligence during the war, who finds his civillian life--wife and kids great career as a free lance journalist and photographer--ruined when he is pulled back into the shadow wars of counterintelligence and counterterrorism.Donald Hamilton created a tough and believable spy in Matt Helm--tough, cynical sometimes mean and nasty, but just enough of a hopeful romantic to believe that if he does his job just right the world will be a litte safer, if only for a while. For grit, toughness and realism, no one beats Hamilton and Matt Helm, and I mean no one."
4,Hold's up well,"Recently decided to obtain and read the entire series. Read this one a few years ago. Did so again. Enjoyed the blunt descriptions of action and the voice of Mr. Hamilton. The detached professionalism stands out as does his insights into human motivation. The ending too has a ruthlessnes that I imagine was quite off-putting back in 1960. All in all, this novel holds up well. Will have more reviews as I continue with the series."
3,Older book with relevant info,"Present Value, Constructing a Sustainable Futre is, at the very least, a useful book. This is an excellent primer on solar technologies for professionals who are trying to relearn some of the basics of sustainable design. Even though is was written in 1979 and looks primarily at residential examples, the basic information and simple technologies haven't changed. Plus, its just fun to see the pictures of the '70's architecture.Simple text and simple graphics are used to explaing the different methods and results, allowing the ideas to be interpreted in new ways. If your local public library doesn't have a copy, the minimal purchase price is worth its reference capabilities. I gave the book 3 stars because its not an exhuastive resouce, obviously dated, but, I believe, still useful."
2,A good book for a beginner,"If you are starting a weight program this is a good book for you. But for someone who is looking for new exercises, something different from the same old bicep curls, this is a book I would NOT recommend. Instead try ""Look Great Sleeveless"" As a personal trainer I found that book to be much more challenging."
4,Fortress Movie,"Speaking as someone with an (albeit limited) familiarity with the low budget movie industry, I was impressed by the overall quality of this film. Not just the quality of the story, which I found to be well-paced and emotionally moving, but also the quality of the film, itself. There were certainly a few points where I was pulled from the story by CGI shots that felt haphazardly thrown in, but these moments were few and far between.All in all, I think this movie does what any movie should: It tells a convincing story, and it leaves its audience feeling thoroughly entertained. Really can't ask for more."
2,drinking solves all your problems in this movie!,What I learned from this movie.Cuss as much as you can f*** f*** F***.Drinking will make you new friends and solve all problems!The movie actually encourages the characters to drink to solve their problems!The story is very very poor. Not realistic and slow broken story.
4,From a B-17 lover,"As a B-17 lover of many years (The late 60's) I have to say I've been waiting for a movie that is centered on the Great Boeing and its contribution to WW-II. This sort of hits the mark... It's aircraft are very well done as far as the FX go, but the acting is second rate...maybe third rate in some respects. But I bought it not for the acting but for the aircraft, and hear it shines. Yes there are problems with the FX aircraft and the B-17 set is off a bit...But who cares...It'll still bring a tear to your eye. I've read so many true life stories about this aircraft and its crews that any film showing the bravery of these men wins a place in my collection."
3,OK considering the massive story line,"This WWII film about B-17 crews based in North Africa bombing Italian targets is ambitious for its task. The story involves a restrained and modest green replacement pilot becoming accepted by his savvy hard-drinking veteran crew. The human story is done well, albeit with a few cliched stock characters. There is of course heavy reliance on CG's and a B-17 actually does a loop (possible?). Considering its an independent production, I give them ""A"" for effort but a ""C+"" for results compared to ""Memphis Belle"" or ""12 O'clock High"". It's worth seeing."
3,Average movie with a bit too much CG,"Pretty much a standard WWII story. Most of the actors did ok, but could have used better direction/writing as some of the scenes were somewhat amateurish. Really good extra features. Overall, worth watching."
5,"Best of U.S., Possibly World","This is the best U.S. publication for chess and perhaps the best in the world. I have purchased or subscribed to most chess magazines in the U.S. and have purchased many from other countries as well. This magazine is probably the best for analysis, news, photos, tournaments, etc. You also get this as part of your USCF membership with magazine, a required membership for playing in U.S. rated tournaments. If chess is your game, this is your magazine."
5,Monique's review,I have wanted to check this magazine out for a long time. I received my first copy long before I thought I would be getting it. Very interesting and informative. Thank you.
4,Fun youth detective mystery,"The adventures of Jimmy and Brains got me through my book reports in the 5th and 6th grade! This series of six books was along the same lines as the Hardy Boys. Two youthful sleuths solve local mysteries. Jimmy is the very average boy who plays a youthful ""Doctor Watson"" type role to Brains Benton's ""Sherlock Holmes."" I really enjoyed these books as a kid growing up and collected all six in the series."
4,I finished the book last night,"Not too bad, although I find the original Nancy Drew series to be much more interesting."
5,Pretty good musical mix,"Lots of great and clear vocals. I was looking for a musical mix and this has a nice sampling of many major songs but also some more recent stuff. I haven't purchased an import before but I would do it again if the opportunity presented itself. It is somewhat annoying to have three cds when I think it could have fit onto two. Still, more than I have complaints, I have compliments about it."
2,Color dye problem...,The blanket itself is soft but the white trim around it I assumed had a dye problem...it was a bit pink ..instead of it being solid white.
4,SO FAR SO GOOD!,"HOLDING A CHARGE VERY WELL, HOPE IT CONTINUES, COLOR DOESN'T MATCH. BUT, IT'S UNDER THE COMPUTER. COST LESS THAN OE AND FAST SHIPPING."
3,replacement battery,battery fits snugly into place unlike other non-apple batteries. charged fully in about 45 minutes and lasts about 3 1/4 hours. good value for the price.
2,Rough shape...,"These flake bars have clearly traveled the world and are a little worse for wear. They're more than a little beat up and broken and the chocolate has a whitish tint that indicates that it's been through multiple transitions in temperature. Most of the writing on the bars seems to be in Arabic but I'm not 100% certain what language it is.With the foggy country-of-origin and Cadbury's recent recall of melamine tainted chocolate from world markets, I'm afraid that the rest of these flakes are destined for the dustbin."
1,Flake/Cadburys has had it's day,"I'm afraid that Flake as well as most of the Cadbury's products I grew up with are no longer the same product, whether purchased in the U.K./Ireland or elsewhere. Whenever I go back to the Isles I buy approx. 100 or so Euro's worth of my favourite Cadburys products and sadly to report none of them taste the same as they used to. They are now closer to the awful taste of Hershey's chocolate than anything else, more sweet and waxy than smooth and silky. There are only two Cadbury's products still worth purchasing as far as I'm concerned; the large bars of plain dairy milk, and the Twirl bar. Twirls are more or less Flakes that are covered or encased in chocolate so they are only Flaky on the inside. Smarties, Flakes, buttons all now taste like American chocolate."
1,Buyer Beware,"I also received my order from the Indian food store, the writing on the wrapper is mainly in Arabic. These are low quality, I've had the real thing on multiple occasions and these had an off taste, different texture and just seemed wrong. Avoid ordering from this company at all costs."
2,Not from England or fresh,"These were definitely not from England. Arabic written all over it. These are most likely the ones imported from the factory in India. While they tasted good, they were not very fresh. Would not buy from this seller again."
1,poor packaging and handling,when sending chocolates thru the mail in the summer they should be sent packaged to keep cool or at least overnightthe pachaging was vary poor. i give it one star. the product would have been 5 if it hadn't melted
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER. ITS FAKE NOT FLAKE,The Candy bars are completely Fake Cadbury Flake Bars. They do not come in a case. They are not of the quality that Cadbury makes. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
4,"Good, but odd and very strange book. Curious if slam poetry may have some of the best of hip-hop","Challenging and quite odd book.The preface is an odd one. Basically that he found words in a symbolic language in a spray can in the subway.I think that is a myth honestly, the word's are Saul's.This is where one of our great slam poets got started.I also think slam poetry has taken many of the greatest aspects of the hip-hop. Storytelling, personal narrative and redemption included.I probably wouldn't read this first for Saul Williams, but well worth reading.Edmund (aka Ed2D2)"
2,Not what i was expecting,I am a really big fan of Saul Williams and his music but this is not that. Maybe I am not a poetry person but if you like his music first look at this book first before you buy it because you might be like me and disappointed with it.
5,Omron HEM-711AC Monitor,"This blood pressure monitor is easy to use and very reliable. It fits into a small, compact bag so is easy to transport, has only two simple connections, and fits a range of arm sizes. It has a memory feature and also provides the heart rate (beats per minute.) I would definitely recommend this to others."
5,Blood Pressure Monitor,"I bought the ""Intellisence"" Blood Pressure Monitor because it was the most highly rated in a Consumer Reports review of a couple of years ago. So far, it has performed very well, though I have not had the opportunity to check its accuracy against the more sophisticated devices at a doctor's office.The combination heart rate (pulse) monitor and memory feature are nice extras. In summary, I am very pleased with the product."
2,Inaccurate readings,"I purchased this item to monitor my blood pressure easily rather that using my medical blood pressure monitor. (Incidentally, I am a physician.) When comparing the automatic blood monitor measurements with my medical monitor I noted a 8-10 mm lower diastolic pressure (the smaller number) in the automatic unit. I contacted the mfg. and they promptly replaced it with one that is accurate and consistent with my medical blood pressure unit. My recommendation is that if you purchase this unit, make sure it is accurate by having your blood pressure checked by your physician's office and comparing it to the automatic unit to insure its accuracy."
5,Does what it says on the box,"The Omrom HDM-711AC is very reliable once you come to terms with the correct placement of the arm band.I ordered it for my parents (both of whom are over 80 yrs) and they use it daily to monitor their blood pressure. While it does log the last readings, there's no way to monitor who's reading it was if you're using for more than one patient - therefore a paper log is best."
4,"Good accuracy, nice unit for decent price","This unit is very easy to use and set up for the basics- monitoring your blood pressure.It comes with a nice zip case and easy instructions. I had no problems getting it to work properly,and it appears to be very accurate. I take my pressure twice a day, and am very happy with this unit.Dont be surprised if you get an occasional reading that seems way to high or low- it could be a variety of factors, including when you do the test, how anxious you are, etc.Read the directions, put on the cuff and press the button. I take my readings and put the results into an Excel spreadsheet, and made a graph to give my Doctor. He really liked having the info right there.Great unit for an affordable price."
5,Excellence at a good price,"The Omron blood pressure monitor is very well made, well designed, easy to use, with many features, and an easy-to-understand manual. What more can you want? Omron has been making monitors for quite some time, so I was comfortable in ordering this. As well as the blood pressure number, you get pulse, and an indicator of too-high-pressure or irregular heartbeat. I am very satisfied."
5,From a 78 year-old engineer,"This Blood Pressure Monitor performs exactly as it was advertized. My family has tried this with the following ages: 72, 50, 45, 12, 8, and 6. They had no pronlem in its use."
4,BP Monitor,The Omron Blood Pressure Monitor is excellent. Read-out is large and easy to read. AND the unit is accurate.
2,This is not accurate,"Somehow a good friend had two of these monitors. Two weeks ago I checked my BP on a pharmacy type machine and my BP was getting borderline. I talked to him about it and he said, hey, I've got a spare, it's yours.I have been using it and getting worried so I took it to my doctors office today to check the accuracy.Omron HEM-711 159/88Doctor's BP cuff 142/72 (nurse also used stethoscope)This is a highly rated unit and I love it. But no matter, ratings are useless if it isn't accurate. Please check it at your doctors office when you receive it(they are used to these things being off). If it's not accurate send it back. It's your choice whether to try again."
5,Great product- great price,Very pleased with the operation of the b/p. Has both plug and batteries for use.Cant buy it in the store for this price.I have a large arm and had no problem with its use.
4,"Simple, works great","This is a great device for daily measuring. Simple to use, easy to store away. I like being able to use AA batteries, so it's ultra-portable. My only prob with it is that w/o batteries - when using the AC adapter, every time you unplug it, it forces you to re-enter the date & time."
5,Excellent product.,"Blood pressure readings are quick, easy to read. I did not have any way to check the accuracy directly, but results were consistent with Doctor's measurements.jhk"
5,Works like a champ,"Had many others before,but this one is the best I ever strapped to my arm. (fast and accurate) I specially lke the memory readings (for reference)."
3,I'm still not sure if this product is for real,"I bought it after seeing many good reviews @ Amazon, but this thing give me wierd readings, sometime they make sense, sometime dont, so i'm not sure how reliable and accurate this thing is when checking BP. I've tried calibrated it with other bp measuring equipment, and still it is not consistent. i'm still deciding if i should keep it or return back. if anyone knows any trick which needs to be done on this machine in order to make it human friendly, then let me know"
3,Blood pressure monitor Pros and Cons,Pros: It seems to be fairy accurate. Much better than a wrist or finger monitor. It's easy to use - put it on then push one button. It takes arrithmia into account when it checks presssure.Cons: It's big and somewhat clumsy. There's no explanation as to why it should be worn differently on right arm vs. left arm.
1,ACCURACY????,I recently purchased an Omron 711 A/C BP monitor and was getting high readings at home. I took it with me to the doctors office and he was baffled to see that readings I took with the machine in his office were 10-20mm higher than when he took the BP. We did it at least 5 times. He had recommended that model and apologized and told me not to use it anymore.
2,"Easy to use, not accurate for me.","This product came highly recommended from a friend who used it and had accurate results when checked against the readings in a doctor's office. Not so for me. The systolic readings were 20-30 points high, even after careful reading the instructions, going over it with tech support a couple of times, and crosschecking a few times. The other readings were reasonable, dystolic were 5-6 pts high, and pulse rate maybe 3-5 beats/minute high vs the doctors office readings at the same time. I returned one unit and got another one. Same story, very high against dr measurements. Returned the 2nd one. Too bad it is so inaccurate for me. It is a easy to use unit, good instructions, helpful tech support, and good ergonomics. It also measured 20pts high against the drug store meter, but I didn't trust that as much."
1,Unstable,"Purchased for my father. We always have to check it three times, and we don't even trust the averages anymore because the three blood pressure rates we took are so far spread apart. In a month, I have set the date and time at least five times. It's going back."
1,Unreliable,"This does not give an accurate reading, sometimes being of as much as 30 points. Very dangerous to rely on this product. I plan to return it."
3,Easy to use but..,"I will say that it is easy to use and comes in a nice travel case. But when I went to the doctor's office to compair numbers against their monitor, it read much higher then it should. I liked the monitor, I just wish that the numbers would be closer to the right number. I'm not happy with it and it has just been sitting in the case."
4,A worthy home monitor,"This is the second model from Omron that I've owned, and it is definitely a couple notches better. Although all of these devices are subject to several sources of error, if you pay attention to those details, this monitor will provide reliable results. It is simple to use, affordable and the AC adapter is a plus."
2,Not an accurate reading with this product,"This product is very easy to use...however my BP readings were 30 points higher than at my Dr's office. I took it in to compare to their readings, we took my BP 4 times-twice with the Omron and twice with their cuff, on the same arm, and the Omron readings were much higher both times.I think this is dangerous and I am returning the product."
2,Omron Not Right On,This monitor has nice reporting features and a very small AC adapter but was very inaccurate. I compared it to a Samsung home model we have and to professional equipment at a clinic. It consistenly gave both readings 15-20 too high and once indicated irregular heart beat. It seems from the reviews of most of these home grade monitors that a few people get poorly calibrated machines. I have returned it since accuracy is critical.
3,Not accurate,"I took the monitor with me to my doctors office and boy was the readings way off! By 28 on the diastolic! The doctor told me the cuff was probably to small and to return the monitor and get one that had a larger cuff (9-17) instead of (9-13) which this one has. He stated it gives a false high reading when the cuff is to small as well as a false low if to big. He also stated to keep my arm postioned right,placing the cuff 1/2 above elbow and air tube running down the inside of your arm palm side up and keep the arm level with your heart for the most accurate reading.I returned this monitor and purchased the ReliOn Easy Wrap Automatic Monitor made by Omron as well, Model HEM-780 and its readings are alot more accurate as well as a much more comfortable cuff thats easier to put on by yourself one handed!Be sure to measure your upper left arm to make sure you purchase one that will fit properly."
4,Inexpensive and efficient,"I bought this monitor after using my granpa's (which he's used for 5 years) and reading reviews online. So far, I have been satisfied with the product as it seems to be built very well. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because the memory and other interface functions are very simple and do not have many advanced features. It does keep an average, however, which is good."
4,Mostly accurate,"We have several different blood pressure monitoring systems in my clinic, and this one is as accurate as all of them. One downside is that it only comes with one size cuff, and I had to go online to purchase a bigger one for my patients who have thicker arms. I feel this should have been made more clear on the product description."
4,Storage case a plus,"I purchased the Omron HEM-711AC to replace a Mabis monitor that was not giving accurate measurements. So far, the Omron has performed very satisfactorily. I like the fact that this unit came with an ac adaptor as well as a storage case. My previous unit had neither. I also like the large numbers on the screen. The Omron brand was recommended by my cardiologist. Amazon had the biggest selection and the best prices."
4,Omron HEM 711AC Review,"PROS: Good device. Accurate, easy. Good construction.CONS: Looses settings if you unplug or don't use batteries.NOTES:I use this to spot check family members - and track readings in a spreadsheet - so I don't need to have extended memory or computer link."
5,Easy to operate. Readings appear accurate,"Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseI have been using this monitor for about one week. So far so good.Easy to set up and fast reading. Note: Read instructions with respect to placement of cuff on left arm vs right arm.This month its $10.00 off price, very good deal.(April 08)"
5,Great blood pressure monitor,"This monitor is an excellent product. First of all, it is a very accurate measuring device. It allows for repeated daily monitoring and averages out the readings for a more accurate total.It is a very easy to use, out of the box unit. Along with the benefits that come from this blood pressure monitor there are also sensors that allow it to detect an erratic heart beat.The price we paid for it, in terms of monitoring our health at home was very well worth every penny."
4,Every household should have one,"Before I settled on this model, I also considered the manual inflation model. I just needed one so that I could monitor my blood pressure, ups vs downs, morning vs evening, before exercise vs after. The manual one makes sense since it's smaller and much more portable at mere $30. I decided on this model for its excellent price/utility ratio: for $25 more I get automatic inflation with intellisense so the inflation could be more consistent, and 60 reading memory so I can track a couple of weeks at a time. It has met my needs; now I have a much better idea when and by how much my blood pressure will swing."
4,Use it every day,"I have checked the accuracy of this blood pressure monitor with ones in stores, doctors office, etc. It is usually pretty close to accurate although may show a little high at times. I made the mistake of getting the average arm cuff - if I had to do it over again, would probably get the larger one as if I don't hook it just right it will pop loose when pumping up. All in all, not a bad little monitor"
4,Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff Review,"Light weight, easy to transport and use on batteries or power, BP readings are consistent in proper setting.. Directions easy to follow. Initial pressure can be uncomfortable."
4,Best buy... not accurate,"From what I have read and found through my research... out of all the ""Automatic"" BP monitors, this unit is the best. The problem is none of the ""Automatic"" BP monitors are consistently accurate. They do averaging because of inconsistent reads and they suggest taking the BP multiple times. High BP is a very dangerous condition... it is just scary having to rely on something this inconsistent when your health is at stake."
1,I had this monitor for several years....but,"It worked fine for a few years, even though I didn't use it much. Now, all it gives is an error message after acting like it's really taking my blood pressure, goes through all the steps and then at the end it reads ""E"" for error. I have followed directions, tried it on both arms again and again.I haven't used it enough to warrant having to send it back to Omron even if they'd take it, which they wouldn't. I'd rather get another brand of blood pressure machine which isn't so finicky and easier to deal with.Diane"
3,Accuracy?,"Bought this unit to replace a wrist type that never seemed to agree with the readings in the Doctors office, even when they were checked side-by-side in the office. Well, this one doesn't agree either???"
4,Omron HEM-711AC Revies,"This is a very good device. I was instructed by my Doctor to monitor my blood pressure every day, twice a day. I originally went to CVS and bought one of their budget monitors which upon taking my first reading, I knew was incorrect. I tried it several times with different reading each time. So I returned it and ordered the Omron. The Omron is well made, easy to use, easy to read and the readings seem to be pretty accurate. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to others."
5,excellent product.,This product is a great blood pressure monitor and I would recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate reading.
4,Quality Product,This blood pressure monitor is very simple to use. Just follow the simple instructions and anyone can keep accurate readings for their records. The AC adapter is included as well as the AA battery feature that allows the unit to become more portable.
4,Good buy but not Great,Overall it's easy to use. The only down-side is the off-on button and memory. Not very easy to clear memory. Mechanics aside...it's a good buy...although a little pricey!!
1,Diissapointment right from puchase in 2007 -beware,"I purchased in 2007 since 18 year old son was showing pre-hypertension...His numbers were extremely high with monitor...brought to his doctor, and he said machine was off, but I didn't take further action since he went off to school..we stashed away until recently 2010..I took my bp two days ago, and numbers were so high - I went to dr. for recheck. All was normal since I take medication, and monitor was way off...how many times have people written this same story... So, now I realize I had a lemon from start and need to return, hoping there will be few problems with return."
5,blood pressure monitor,"The Omron monitor came on time, was new like they stated in their ad,included was a cord to plug in opposed to using batteries and I like that much better, and it worked perfectly. I took it to my doctors office and compared the two blood pressure readings and they were right on. I am very happy with my monitor and would order from them again."
3,BP monitor,"Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseWe like the operation of this device but, it seems to give inconsistent readings. The doctor's office will show a significant difference when compared to this instrument. We came home immediately and checked the readings after leaving the doctor's office. The readings at the doctor's office were substantially lower (better) than on the Omni.JR DugasLynn, MA"
1,Quality control problems?,"I bought this product based on a Consumer Reports rating. Like other reviewers, I was getting consistently high readings - much higher than my doctor. I called Omron's customer relations and after several minutes of answering silly questions, I was advised to return it. I went to a store and pulled a new one out of the box. While it was closer, it still gave readings 10 points higher than the instore machine. Omron needs to quickly fix this quality control problem."
3,711 did register too high x2,"My wife and I have independently checked our Omron with our two different doctors using manual BP cuffs. The Omron was over 10 points higher both times (yes, we line up the pump properly). We then got a brand new Omron to take consecutive readings against ours and diastolic was exact between machines for both of us. We returned the new one, and continue using our old one, fairly secure in the knowledge that readings that would be considered borderline are nothing to worry about. Suggest other users do the same if getting higher readings (80+ diastolic)."
3,cuff for females only?,"I'm not a big guy, especially my arms... so I was surprised to find that the supplied cuff is actually too small for me! Rather than order the larger cuff, I'm returning and ordering the HEM-780 so both my wife and I can use the same cuff."
3,Omron HEM-711AC B/P Monitor,"Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseThe monitor functions well, however, the accuracy when compared to the readings obtained at the Doctors office with a mercury sphygmomanometer is off by about twenty points. It may be a quirk in the unit I purchased, as this unit was judged excellent in a recent publication from an independent testing lab."
5,Very Intelligent,"I am extremely pleased with this product. It is very easy to use and I feel that it is quite accurate. You do need to insert batteries in order to use the memory feature because when you use the ac adapter and then unplug it, the memory doesn't remember. It is an excellent monitor for a beginner who wants to keep track of your blood pressure away from the doctor's office."
4,"Good and accurate readings, I love this brand","Recently purchased an item and I love an accuracy of readings and simplicity of usage! It also have a feature to measure yor heartbeat and determine whether it is abnormal or not which is very important. I bought wrist monitor from this brand (OMRON) 2 years ago for my mother,she has high blood pressure and it's amazing how accurate readings in comparison with manual monitor.Hope this one will work fine as well!"
2,OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor,Product is not accurate when compared to physician's office mecury level device. Product was compared to two such devices and found to be off by more than 40 points systolic and 20 points diasystolic.
1,"Not Accurate, Awful Customer Service","My mother has high blood pressure and her doctor wanted her to have a home monitor. We got this model and it seemed to be too high most of the time. I brought it with us the next time she saw her hypertension specialist. He made six measurements with his equipment and six with the Omron and it was WILDLY inaccurate, reading 30-40 points too high each time. The doctor told my mother never to use it again. When we called Omron, we were told to send it back (at our expense) and they would look at it and send it back (also at our expense). Since we had done this once already and it still didn't work, we're just going to toss it away. So much for their warranty. Omron used to be a good name, but it seems they are now making shoddy equipment."
1,A Waste of Time,"This product gave an impossibly high reading, prompting a trip to my doctor. Rather than 230 it was really 160. I returned the product for a refund."
1,Accurate Readings For only 6 Months,"I bought this blood pressure monitor 6 months ago and used it according to the directions. Until this week, it worked accurately. Now it gives inaccurate high readings in the stroke or coma range. am now looking for a better automatic blood pressure monitor that is not an Omron brand."
3,Omron blood pressure monitor,The Omron blood pressure monitor is accurate. It has a memory that couldkeep up to 60 blood pressure measurements. But the interval between eachbeep is between 5 to 6 points. That is too long and may cause inaccurate measurements.Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSense
2,DIsappointing machine,"The hospital provided me with this monitor after my kidney transplant. Right away, readings were 20-30 points too high. Luckily, I didn't pay for it.It gets two stars only because I always assume it's 20 points too high and subtract."
3,I think it's pretty good one,"I bought one on december, 2005. Then I send it to my uncle, who is actually the user. My uncle told me it works well and satisfiyed what he wanted.I also want to buy for my family, however, I lived in China and I think the adaptor doesn't fit it well. So I guess in future, I would prefer to buy a Blood Pressure Monitor which could fit like 220V. Thanks"
3,Omron HEM-711AC,Easy to use. Not sure my wife believe the reading. She takes three readings every morning. At least twice a week she then asks me to measure her BP with manual monitor. Is it she or there is a reliability issue with the device? We are keeping it as the price is right
4,good stuff.,"Works well. Huge range in price, depending where you buy it. Amazon was cheaper than national stores."
1,Measure Your Arm First!,"Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff!Don't bother calling Omron ""Customer Service"" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece...My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons ""customer service"""
1,Worthless & Frightening,Gives consistantly bad (always high) data. It was replaced once for the same reason and the result was an equally defective product.
5,Benny,"A very good blood pressure and pulse monitor. I found it very easy to use, and very reliable, at a reasonable cost. The battery back-up is a good feature, as is the memory feature."
5,Easy to Use and Read and Full-featured,"This is an excellent and easy to use, easy to read machine. There is no guessing - inflation is automatic. It is especially nice that an AC adapter is provided - no worry about dead batteries. You must follow directions about the placement of the cuff and you will get accurate readings. We tried it twice on each of us and it was within a couple of points each time, which is normal. The irregular heartbeat indicator is a nice plus with this model as well."
2,Not up to snuff,"The blood pressure machine arrived the day after ordering it, which I think was outstanding. Unfortunately, though, the readings I'm seeing are very high compared to like machines and another blood pressue ""cuff"" I have available. I see others are experiencing the same problem."
5,Easy to use,"I was struggling with taking my blood pressure with a manual BP cuff. The medicine I was on made it difficult for me to hear my heartbeat so I was having to pump numerous times. To reduce my stress I decided to purchase an automatic monitor. After researching various units on the internet, I chose the Omron HEM-711AC. This unit has exceeded my expectations. Its very easy to use. It comes with a soft travel case which came in handy on a recent trip. I used the unit on the airplace and on the cruise ship as it comes with a plug, but also runs on batteries. The memory feature eliminates the need to have pen and paper handy. Just a great product.I did check accuracy in the doctors office. The Omron reading was within 5% as long as the BP check procedures included with the machine were followed: you need to be consistent with the position of the cuff, your arm, etc."
4,Very good blood pressure meter,"The Omron HEM-711AC is a very good and easy to use Monitor. The large numbers make it easy to read, and the ability to get an average of the previous reading is very useful. The automatic function is very handy for people who are not able to use the hand pump eaisly. The only draw back is that the battery live is not very long, however using the included power adapter solves that problem."
3,Good nautical fiction,"Kent's writing here (and in v.1&2) isn't geared for the ultra-knowledgeable Jack Tar, but for those whose feet are at least damp from the sea spray. No foot notes, but not much exotic vocabulary, either.The writing style and non-stop adventure seem better suited for an action movie or adolescent reading. Now, that said, it would make a great action movie, and I would encourage younger kids to read it.If you're shoaled on O'Brian's highly technical writing, give this a try. Chock full of adventure, a young boy is growing up in the Royal Navy. There are the continuing steotypes he uses to learn from (the overly-harsh lieutenant, the distant captain, etc.)Bonus for us Yanks, this volume is set in America during the Revolution.A good read: quick, easy. Read it to your kids, just to get them loving the sea early."
2,Naval fiction for adolescents,"For those who enjoy naval fiction and expect something of quality (an O'Brian or Forester, perhaps) these books will prove to be disappointing. They are not bad, just not very well written; perhaps more suitable for teenage than adult readers. In addition to an abundance of clichés, Kent/Reeman employs bizarre similes which `slap' the reader out of the narrative, straight back to the printed page. In addition, the novels tend to be predictable and over sentimental. They are not bad but they are not that good, either."
3,Almost as good as O'Brian,"This series of novels is excellent, but if you really want the best novels about this era in British Naval history, you should read the Patrick O'Brian novels (the movie Master & Commander was based on the O'Brian books). They give you a much deeper understanding of that era, ashore as well as at sea. You will also want to get ""A Sea of Words"" by Dean King which is an encyclopedia of nautical and other terms of the period. Wonder what a ""fid"" is, or a ""main topgallant studdingsail"" is, or what ""spotted dick"" is? ""A Sea of Words"" will tell you."
3,More good naval adventure,"No point in reviewing the individual books, if you are into this sort of thing you will read the series and decide for yourself if they were worth your time."
2,Review,"The book was fine; however, the company I ordered it through it took over a month to come. The book is an easier read and helpful as far as accounting books go. I would recoment it to anyone who needs to learn about accounting in the aviation industry."
1,A long-time King Britt fan is sorely disappointed,"I have been a King Britt fan from the beginning, and love both his upbeat material and quirky compilations. But this CD is just horrendous. It is all extremely avant-garde-ish jazz music, not at all a chill-out mix. Listening to it several times, even very late at night, has not made me like it any more. If I walked into a lounge (even one billed as a ""Cosmic Lounge"") where this music was playing, I would turn around and walk right out. I'd definitely recommend giving this CD a pass."
1,It didn't work.,"I operate a console gaming center and I use wired Xbox 360 controllers over usb/cat5. I was hoping that these would work better than the ones I already have which allow me to use the controllers and headsets but not rumble. These, however, would not even allow the controller to connect, and they cost twice as much as the ones I was already using!"
3,"NOT the ""Eating February"" band...","This album is by the same name ""Star 69"" as another band called ""Star 69"". This is NOT the band that recorded 1997's ""Eating February"" and is NOT the band led by Julie Daniels. THIS band is led by Kathy Green."
2,NOT 2MP!!!,"The packaging clearly states 2MP. Boy was I surprised by the crap photos! Upon further inspection of the box I found the fine print on the bottom that says 2MP ""interpolation"" - what the %$#@? It turns out that you can use the software to upconvert after the fact to be able to print your oh so crappy photos.The kids are having fun with the games and in camera photo editing (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1), but Mommy is highly disapointed."
4,My nephew loves,"This is a durible toy that takes less than average pictures, but it is a toy. My nephew loves it and leaves my broithers camera alone now."
3,Kids digital camera,I thought the view finder would be a little more clear. When you click to take a picture it takes it awhile so it's hard to get a picture that is clear. When I try to take a picture of my child she usually moves before it snaps the picture and all I get is a blurr. Just not as good a camera as I thought. But it is durable. My little girl has dropped it a thousand times and it is still working!! I have to give thumbs up on withstanding a child!!
3,"Lots of fun, but poor pic quality","I bought this for my 3 year old on his birthday. He can easily use the features and loves the little games included. We've had it about 2 months now it's been dropped, kicked, and stood on and no damage seems to be done. My biggest and really only problem with this camera is the price doesn't match the picture quality. Unless the person taking the picture and the subject are completely still the pictues are often very blurred. He doesn't seem to mind that he can barely see what he just took a picture of, but I had to do again I'd bought somehting with more megapixils."
1,Poor Quality,"The camera view screen is dark and the photos are barely visible, thinking of returning product. I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,Great kids camera,I bought this camera for my 3 yr old grandson as a Christmas gift. He is doing very well at learning how to point the camera at his subject and taking a good photo.
5,Great,"Great product, I bought this product for my daughter when she was a toddler. She is 11 now, and it is still going strong. She got many hours of enjoyment from it and it hasn't broken, yet."
3,exactly what was promised,The screen is too small and getting the pics to the computer is complicated as you must use a cable
1,Truly awful product for kids,"Quit working after the first drop to a concrete floor from about 3 feet. Despite all the apparent shock protection, it is not well-made. Further off buying a Polaroid digital camera for about the same cost. Picture quality is poor. Response is slow. Huge disappointment. Would recommend everyone buy something else. Would never buy again."
4,Great Camera for a young child,We bought this camera for our 3 year old as a Christmas Gift. So far it is a great choice. He loves to take pictures and it is still holding his interest. As mentioned it doesn't take the most high quality photos but its for a 3 year old so we didn't expect the same as a high end digital would provide. We love the editing features and have a great time playing with the pictures and adding voices to them. We took the suggestion someone made about purchasing the additional memory cartridge and would make the same recommendation to others. It is worth the little extra it will cost. Quality wise it is holding up well with the several bumps and drops it gets on a daily basis. Overall we would purchase this camera again and recommend it to our friends with toddlers.
2,Camera not very good for picture taking,"The camera offers games as an option which is good for a 4-year old. However, the digital screen is very dark in ordinary light. The resulting pictures are either over-exposed and light or under-exposed and dark; there is no middle ground. Also the camera does not allow any adjustments. This function would have to be vastly improved for the camera to get higher marks from me."
1,Great product on the outside... lousy camera in the inside,"We bought this gift as a christmas gift for our 4 year old, and while the product is very nice in the outside for the kids - nice colours, good grip, easy to use, nice buttons, good design- the quality of the pictures is very bad, especially if you are looking to create your kid first album. The vast majority of the pictures comes white... and those that are not white have a very lousy quality image. Indeed a cellphone camera makes a better job. I assume VTech might improve the megapixel for the next camera, but in the meantime I would not recommend you to buy this camera. For 1/3 of the cost (currently at 70), you can buy a digital camera from CVS that makes a better job than this one."
4,Great Camera for kids - gets their paws off yours!,"I highly recommend this children's camera. It's the first one that finally diverted my 2.5yo's attention off my own camera! A little too sophisticated for him, but he's still under the recommended age (3y). I anticipate him to grow into it nicely."
3,Could be better,"I was very excited about this toy when we ordered it. The first one we got was DOA and would not work at all. It had been a birthday present so this was a hassle. When we finally got it, it was okay. I would still suggest the Vtech over the other brands."
3,"Good for fun, not high quality pics","Both 3 and 7 yr old boys like to play with this. Takes still pics well. My 3 yr old doesn't hold still very long so all of his pics are a blur! Fun, but expensive for a play camera."
5,the best birthday gift for kids,I bought this camera for my 3 year old grandson's birthday. It was his most favorite gift...and still is. It's easy to use..he figured it out right away. And it takes great pictures. Plus it's durable..especially since the owner is 3 years old.
5,Favorite Gift!,"Both of my granddaughters received this camera for Christmas (ages 2 and 4), even though we thought the 2 year old was too young. They both like to play with my digital camera and their mother's (which is very expensive and definitely NOT a toy!)so hoped to dissuade them with this toy camera. They both have had a ton of fun with their cameras and the two year old actually uses it more than her sister. They love the video feature and even though the pictures aren't very good in quality, they are enough to satisfy young kids. It is very durable, being dropped numerous times the first day with no damage. Big, easy buttons for little fingers to manipulate. I paid more for this than I would have liked, as I waited too close to Christmas, but didn't realize how hard they would be to find. The actual retail price of $[...] is very reasonable, though. I think this is one toy that will get used long after the holidays!"
5,Great camera for little kids,"I bought this for my 3 year old son after reading all the reviews on various cameras. This one has a flash that can be turned on or off. It has three games on it that my preschooler can play by himself after I showed him how. It comes with software to download pics to the computer which is great. It has a viewfinder as well as an LCD screen. I'd say the only negative thing is it has to be held fairly still to take a clear picture, with a slow reaction time after pushing the button."
3,Eats batteries like candy,"Fair picture quality, nice little games,Very poor battery life, need to be changed every few hours at the best"
4,Good first choice,"Purchased this for 3 year old daughter. Very easy to learn to use. She loves taking pictures and playing the games. Yes, the photos are a little grainy, but little kids can't hold the camera still anyway. She loves it and that's what matters. We didn't purchase any extra storage and have yet to run out of space as we download frequently enough with no issues. Durable, reliable, fun."
1,junk don't buy it,We tried 2 blue hat toys this Christmas. We were unable to get either the mp3 player or this camera working.Battery cover is completely impossible. Don't buy this toy its junk.
4,Kids Camera,"Bought this camera for my son for his 3rd birthday(he kept asking for my camera to take pictures). Controls are not difficult for an adult but not super easy for a child of this age. Very durable. However, the only shortcoming is a substandard flash, Many pictures are dark on the small LCD screen. I'm not 100% sure its not the screen but I'm pretty sure its the flash."
5,Worth every penny,"I purchased this camera for my 3 year old grandson. He was thrilled. He figured out how to operate the games on the camera without any help from an adult and while one review I read said the games drained the battery power, I didn't find that to be accurate. It is so much fun to see what he chooses to take pictures of. While the camera shoots pictures with about the quality of a cell phone it is not discouraging in any way to him, he shows them off quite proudly. It fits his hands well and seems quite easy to aim, steady and shoot. I highly recommend this camera, it goes beyond a toy."
4,Kid's camera review,"My son really likes this camera. The camera was given to him on his 5th b-day. The photo quality is so-so, but the games are fun. You need to be close to the object to get a decent picture and if the flash is accidently turned off the photos are black."
3,Even grainier than expected,"I had read previous reviews for the product, but the picture quality is still below my expectations. With that said, my 3 year-old still likes the camera."
1,Don't do it,"My kids received this as a Christmas present. I knew the pictures wouldn't be great, but I at least expected you could see the people in the pictures. They really are bad and the flash is even worse. I was highly disappointed in this camera. They'd have been better off with a cheap real camera that even if they broke it we could just replace for as much as this one costs. You also have to use a screw driver to get into the memory card if you want to get it out and it's in the same place as half of the batteries. Our screw was stripped quickly and it is already worthless than 3 months after getting it. They can pretend with it, but don't expect pictures that will even print wallet sized."
2,Picture NOT Perfect,It would be a great product if the picture / video quality was better. My 4 year old son has used my camera and has taken some good pictures. I thought this would be a perfect Christmas gift. I should have taken a chance with a real digital camera and see how long it would have lasted. At least he can have some fun until I find a better one.Update: After one and a half years of nominal use the camera does not work any more. Was not worth the money.
5,This is a great buy,"I bought this for my son's 7th birthday because he loves to take pictures. I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but it is a great camera. You can turn the flash on and off, and the clarity is pretty good. I love that you can expand the memory too. It also has gread editing options, which he loves to use. He figured out how to use this camera in 10 minutes- it's so easy. He loves to take movies with it also."
1,Picture quality,I bought 2 of the cameras for my grandchildren. The camera seems to be well built but the picture quality is worst than a cell phone for resolution and picture quality. I was very disapointed on Christmas morning the we opened the package and the kids took pictures. They put them down and have not picked then up since. The pictures were very dark and even with the flash were disapointing. I would like to return it.
1,"Not bad, while it lasted.","The pictures and movie quality were mediocre-- hardly worth the $75-80 we paid for this camera. But my kids both loved the toy. The shocker was how quickly it died. Because it was such an expensive toy we only let them play with it on trips, like on the airplane. Imagine my surprise when this apparently ridiculously durable looking toy, built and weighing like a tank, broke after maybe 5 uses, all under adult supervision. None of the buttons work anymore. No idea what caused it to die, but it's not as if it was dipped in water or dropped or anything. Terribly disappointing. At about $15-20 I'd consider myself satisfied with what we got out of it. At $30-40 I'd consider myself disappointed. At $75-80 I feel completely ripped off."
3,nice for kids 3-4 yrs,"photos come out ok, did not last so much with my kid. does not work with cheap batteries. after kid turned five he wanted a ""real camera"" like the one I have."
5,Love this camera,"We have had this camera for 2 years, and for 2 children ages 4 and 2. It still works like brand new! My kids love it. They have dropped it, thrown it, etc. Watch for sales on these through amazon. We bought it for $29 the day after Thanksgiving with free shipping. The picture quality is fine for a kid. My kids can easily see the pic they took, and have no trouble using it."
3,Not perfect,"The camera seems to be durable but it is very slow the pictures have a low quality. However, the children enjoy using it, especially because of the games on it."
5,Cool Vtech Product!,"My 6 year son old has CP and absolutely loves his camera.Its a great ""cause and effect"" product, and very durable."
2,Was great while it worked.,"My 6 year old son loved this and took a lot of great photos, but then it just went dead after about 2 weeks. There was no accident and changing the batteries didn't do anything. My son is now very disappointed and we are looking for another camera."
5,Great first camera for kids,"I bought this camera for my 6 year old nephew and he loves it. His favorite feature is being able to add the goofy effects to the picture when he's taking it. I was definitely surprised by how many features this camera had and how easy it was to use. I was a little apprehensive to purchase it at first since it's rated for 3+, I didn't want it to be a kiddy camera but one that he felt was more ""grown-up"" ~ that's definitely what we got. He loves the fact that he can take pictures and see them like his parents camera does. I would highly recommend this camera to kids ages 3 to 10."
2,Camera died in 1 day!,"Despite the fabulous reviews for this product we were very disappointed. While we enjoyed it for a day, the thing stopped working exactly 24 hours after it came out of the box. My 4 yo daughter is pretty bummed. I can't say how this will be resolved; I emailed the company as suggested in the product literature and at this point am hopeful they'll simply replace it. We followed the instructions to the letter and checked the trouble-shooting guide as well. I wish I could rate the toy higher but its short life merits my low rating."
4,Fun Camera!,My son loves to take pictures. This camera is easy to use and has three game options. My son likes the tic-tac-toe game the best. The quality of the pictures is good and there are editing options on the camera. Other good features include being able to connect to the computer and the television. The camera is durable too! We are very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to friends. Thanks!
1,Bad camera!!,Not as easy to use as advertised. Slow processing shots so the kids using it get distracted easily. I took it back to ToysRUs!
4,Great kids' camera,"Most of these reviews have been accurate. The batteries lasted a few weeks, the flash can white things out in certain circumstances. My son is 2 1/2 and takes pretty nice pictures with it. I put a memory card in and he can take hundreds of pics..."
4,Great for Toddlers!,"We bought two of these for our 2 1/2 year old bou-girl twins and they LOVE them! I was pleasantly surprised to find out they come with interchangeable faceplates, which made it easy to customize them for each kid. My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry the other colors of this camera. For people worried about the picture quality: it's for a toddler. So far, ours have shown no interest in actually seeing the pictures they took. The real purpose of these is so they leave our camera alone! :)"
3,2nd v-tech camera for daughter,"We had a terrific first experience with our v-tech camera so when it finally gave out we bought another to replace it. This camera however has been disappointing so far. I'm not sure if it's a lemon, but we've had a few issues so we are planning on returning it - what a pain."
1,"waist of batteries, cant use rechargeable, total disappointment with my daughter","at first we really liked this camera, perfect for a three year old. but after the second day, we realized if she wanted to use it, we would have to replace the batteries every single day. seriously! on their website, they even say you cant use rechargeables. my daughter was so disappointed when i told her i cant buy batteries for her camera everyday. if we could do it all over, i would have gotten her a cheap, regular digital camera, with a rechargeable battery system.dont buy this unless you like waisting money on batteries"
4,Perfect camera for my 4-year-old...,"My two kids (4yr old boy and 18mo girl) LOOOOVE playing with mommy's Canon digital camera but, since Santa brought this camera for my son, they both love taking pictures with this. My son loves having his own camera with cool kid features (add borders and extras to the photos, take video, play games, etc). Plus, the size is perfect for my daughter's little hands that she hasn't thought about my Canon anymore. I generally like Vtech products. The other night, my 8-year-old niece was playing with this too, taking picures and playing the games. I haven't uploaded his pictures yet (he likes looking at them through the LCD) but I'm not expecting the resolution to be great at all (the flash alone is very poor, you have to be up close)... the reviews said the photos were poor. I'm sure the novelty of it will eventually wear off like with most toys, but it's definitely a good toy to have, esp if you have kids you don't want touching your camera."
4,Good Steak Knives,"I bought these knives as a present for my boyfriend. We haven't had them long enough to see how well they stay sharp, but my parents have a set of the expensive 4 star knives and they seem comparable at this point. They aren't quite as heavy, the handles aren't as nice, and you can't sharpen them, but they were still a great deal on sale."
4,knives,"The item is for a Christmas gift - delivery was quick - Packaging was a bit generic, but I am familiar with the brand."
2,Dishwasher Unsafe!,"These knives were functional and looked good for one day, until I put them in the dishwasher. The rivets discolored to a dull, spotted gray, and the black handles turned a bit milky. They retained their function, a decent serrated knife, but are really not presentable, even in the most informal settings.I have had similar Henckels steak knives that retained their original look for years. Not these.I have better forged kitchen knives which I hand wash. I know what I am doing. These knives are a disappointment."
4,cut just fine,"These carve steak just fine. They are stamped ""made in Thailand"" but they are not every day use knives. They should last a long time."
5,FANTASTIC KNIVES,Great feel and balance. Excellent quality and very sharp. They are so much better than the cheap knives we used before. Highly recommended.
4,Kind of disappointed,"The knife handles are kind of small, so if you have larger hands, they do not grip as well. I would recommend getting a knife set with large handles. Otherwise they cut pretty nicely."
2,"""24""","Overall i am satisfied with the product. However. Disk 4 of Season one was damaged, and I could not view any of the episodes."
5,24 is the real thing,"What can I say? 24 is the REAL THING. By this I mean that it is super entertaining and brilliantly casted and written. To anyone who loves heart stopping action and ""on-the-edge-of-your-seat"" TV drama, this is the one to watch. Keifer has that special something that many TV actors lack and the rest of the cast is also very good. Buy this if you can; you will not be sorry."
1,CBS MAN - 24 Seasons 1-6,"I have yet to receive my purchase. I have emailed CBS MAN to check on the status of my order twice, but I've yet to receive any response. I will change my rating later if I actually get what I paid for."
3,"great for Stanton fan, but a bit dated for others","A nice huge book with tons of Stanton's art reproduced in large format and very accurately covering most of his career.For fans who are into more modern scenes of SM and leather erotica and porn, Stanton would seem a little dated, almost burlesque-era. Still very nice for historical interest."
5,Amazing jar collecting book.,My husband is the collector but I've seen the books he has had to deal with in the past. This book is by far the best reference that helps the novice to advanced collector.
3,Item was not as pictured.,The book pictured is not the book I received. I feel that this was very deceptive. The book I received was a much older edition and does not look at all like that pictured. The content of the book itself is good.
2,Returned this item,I was disappointed to find a soft cover and not the latest edition - if there was one. It was no different from the hardcover edition we already had. I returned it and was satisfied with how that was handled.
2,Condition,I like the book very much but the price of the book was to much for the condition it was in.
2,Disappointed,"The picture looks like it would be some type of metal or even heavy plastic, but when it arrived it was clear plastic. Didn't look anything like the picture. It also cracked the first time I used it. :("
4,The Sequel to the Original Book,"""One doesn't have to have music degree to understand how certain types of music appeal to our flesh."" This highly convincing sequel to Smith's previous book ""Oh Be Careful Little Ears,"" further explores sensuality in music and how we need to deny our flesh and not feed it in worship. This is reccomended reading for every church."
1,"Don't buy, non-standard installer and has hardware conflicts in Vista","Product says that it is Vista compatible but it was not in my case. I ended up having to return this product. First of all it has a non-standard installer. When finally getting it installed in an unusual way, there are hardware conflicts. Try to fix this then it does not even partially recognize the device. If you check the linksys website the only have the old driver which ships with the product. A complete waste of my time."
1,This card crashes windows,Don't buy this card until they fix the thing. It crashes my pc whenever I install it. When I disable the card my pc runs fine but when I enable it then 20mins later my pc crashes. Please use another more stable card because this card was not ready to be sold to consumers.
4,Great signal and never drops it,"I found this product supper easy. its just plug and play. the microsoft software will run it but once your online go get the real stuff off there website. P.S. don't expect any help from lynksys costumer support, there useless chimps"
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 7 64-BIT,"I have owned this card for several years, it's a complete pain in the ass with very good range. I recently upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit and after a lot of looking and finally live chat with linksys, this device is absolutely not compatible with windows7 64-bit. it will cause random lock up and blue screens, if you can get it to work at all. Linksys has this information hidden away on their website, despite their driver download saying its compatible with windows 7 64bit. It absolutely is not, try it and you will find your pc randomly locking up all the time."
1,Do not waste your money.,Driver problems with this item as others have posted. Will not hold signal from router 80' away.No updated driver available.
1,Blue Screen of Death on 2x PC's,I purchased two WMP300N's for two computers. One is a stock Dell Dimension and the other is a custom computer with an A8N-SLI Deluxe MB.BOTH COMPUTERS BLUESCREEN after random amounts of time. I've tried the new and old drivers from Linksys.These cards are going back.
2,weak signal,this thing sucks. my laptop wireless works better than this. this thing bottlenecks my download speeds. i use windows XP and have used it with vista same results.
2,WMP300N Does Not work with Windows 7,Windows 7 has been in testing for over a year yet this device has no windows 7 drivers. If you want a windows 7 adapter for your desktop this is not compatable with Any version.
1,"Caution, nightmare","I am not a computer whiz. I installed this product and the drivers on the CD on my XP system. The product seemed to work fine. Soon after, I noticed the computer was freezing up. Foolishly I didn't put 2 and 2 together, and assumed that the computer was overheating, because I'd had another do this. I began fiddling with the heat sink, and ended up screwing up the computer. I ended up getting a whole new computer before I realized that it was this product that was bad. My new computer began freezing up, too. Doh. I finally got it. So beware!PS Looking back at the reviews (1/09) I gather that it works better on Vista, but I am amazed at how many people give it 5 stars, though noting that they had to do a custom install, evidently because of high speeds and range. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Mine's unused on a shelf in the basement."
1,this item is not worth the money,the linksys wireless -n router and pci adap. i purchased lasted about a week then dropped for no reason and wont come back up. ive tried everything i could think of to get a connection again and nothing worked. as far as im concerned ill just stick with a company i trust from now on. (D-LINK) the linksys website sucks. the tech support sucks. the items suck. never again will i buy a linksys item or purchase anything for my pc from amazon.
1,WMP300N Freezes on Windows XP,"I am running Windows XP, sp2 and had nothing but problems with this card (Linksys WMP300N). In short, the wireless would connect to my router (also Linksys N) for a short period it did provide internet access, but within 5, sometimes 10 minutes, the computer would freeze up. No movement, mouse, keyboard and applications all froze. I spent a couple weeks working off of a number of forums, tried a number of fixes, including bypassing the Linksys management tool, using the Windows wireless manager, but to no avail. I broke down and went back to Frys and picked up a Belkin N today - works like a charm, no lockup, no freezing and the wireless access is up and running again. My best advice, save yourself the headache and pick up a different card - perhaps the problem is related to Windows XP and if your running Vista you may have better luck than I did. No offense to Linksys, love the router. But the WMP300N leaves much to be desired. Thanks for reading and good luck."
3,Bad Defaults,"I have been having issues with wireless networking in my house. I'm not sure if it's the wiring or what, but I've gone through a series of wireless routers and wireless adapters trying to get a combination that will work.This one does work... provided that you tinker with the advanced settings and turn off WMM and Xpress Technology. With them on, I was getting some ridiculous amount of packet loss in Quake. With them off, it played reasonably well. More tinkering with the advanced settings, and I have it running relatively smoothly now.So... it's fine, as long as you're willing to tinker away at it. I never installed the drivers off the CD so I never saw the bluescreens of death, just downloaded the drivers off the Linksys website and everything went fine."
3,WMP300N (2nd time around),"The first one of these received was seemingly bad, so I waster quite a lot of time with LinkSys support before sending it back for replacement. Amazon returns are excellent!The problem I had with the 1st one was that it would hang the PC up ""hard"". Couldn't even Ctrl/Alt/Del. Had to force power off the PC. 2nd unit seems to work well. I have the PC with the WMP300N 2 floors up from the WRT610N router in the basement. Bit rate seems to vary from 54Mbps to around 160. I have played around with the N stuff too much yet, so I may be able to get this to improve."
5,Easy Excellent Range,You can't beat this adapter for ease of installation and setup. Excellent range. Setup went smoothly with a linksys and netlink routers.
5,Media Center Must!,"This device is precisely what I needed to get my media center PC connected to myhome wireless LAN. The external antenna provides great reception in the entertainment center that other internal radios, such as the wireless hardware within my laptop, had trouble with. I have been downloading quite a bit of iTunes movies to my 42"" flat screen. I love the setup and I love this wirless device. 5 Stars!"
2,"Works fine on 2.4 ghz, DOES NOT HAVE 5 GHZ BAND","This is a silly, silly, silly product. It connects at 2.4ghz just fine, no complaints, and the transfer rate is ok. But most people who are in the market for a N-band wireless card would like the 5ghz band. THIS CARD CANNOT RECIEVED 5GHZ BAND SIGNALS. It was a waste of money for me that is now sitting in my closet. If you have a dual band router, do not waste you're time with this PCI card - get the dual band USB card which works great, on both 2.4 and 5 ghz bands."
1,Not so good of a product,"I purchased it because it had a good name and my apartment had too much moisture. Once I set it up, the dehumidifier did not collect any moisture and runs very loud. We tried it for a few more days, but no moisture was collected. Had to return it. It was somewhat a hassle trying to use the same box to repack it."
4,De Longhi,Has worked for years. Wheels need to be stronger(plastic instead of rubber and one fell off) and a little bigger for moving it.
2,"Extremely basic, not too much to learn","The book is so basic that you can not really learn that much.They teach the game rules but not more than that. It really lacks strategies.So, if you already know how to play but you want to improve your skills, this is not the right book"
2,FIve dollar slots?,"This book seemingly recommended five dollar slot machines. The title IS . . .for DUMMIES, and that's what I feel like after following this seeming recommendation. I lost my money 100 times faster than I would have on a nickel slot. If I hadn't read this book, I would never have gone near the five dollar slots ! ! !I kept putting in money, confident that the odds were greater of winning than on those cheapo slots I never enjoyed. Maybe that is true, but the wording was irresponsible in a book with this title !If you have thousands to play with, you might be alright. I had hundreds, and thought I could take a risk. My money was gone in the blink of an eye.I never would have played ANY slots. This book recommended the five dollar ones, if you want to play any. That's what I thought."
3,Comfy but could be better,"Well for one it's very pink. That can be a plus or a minus depending on your tastes. The memory foam is soft and comfortable, or so my wife says. But after 2 weeks I am already noticing some wear and tear. So I think the quality and longevity of this product may be suspect."
2,Not Well Made,"Slippers did not fit well even though they were the correct size. Also, memory foam did not bounce back and finally I had to stop wearing them after only a few weeks."
3,Helpful but........,"I found this book to be helpful in researching family photos, however it has drawbacks. The book is very detailed about the history of photgraphy but far more detailed than I needed for help to date photos. Also the examples are from the UK not the USA. I would search for another source that is geared for an American interested in dating family photos."
2,Alienating,"A Brechtian production, with comic music undercutting the play throughout. The Verfremdungseffekt is compounded by the casting of Paul Jesson, that most plebeian of actors, as Coriolanus, the ultimate patrician. This makes the recording a chore to get through, depite a decent performance by Marjorie Yates as Volumnia. One could accept Antony and Cleopatra in a Brechtian mode, since that play is without illusions. But in Coriolanus, military heroism, martial glory and absolute integrity are genuine (if not all-encompassing) values, and are not to be travestied by farting tubas and over-parted actors. Brecht, of course, wrote his own version of Coriolanus. Directors are welcome to mount that play; they are not welcome to diminish Shakespeare's."
3,Not my Kind of Read,"I thoguht the book was OK, I did not care for the story line, such as it was. The ending was not very good."
4,get aboard!,"this book answers the question, ""who would you meet on a bus in the middle of nowhere in southern california?"" answer: dreamers, malcontents, hustlers, elitists, and strippers. this well defined cast of characters makes for a fascinating read.althought the story only covers two days, steinbeck takes the time to go back and let us know about each character and what makes them tick. these are real people with real issues. the reader can identify with all of them if he is honest with himself. these people are a true slice of americana. they have hopes and dreams as well as misgivings and problems. their lives have good things and bad things that impact them still today. what happens with them after they get off the bus is not really important. just meeting them and seeing them interact is all you need.this is quality steinbeck so don't miss the bus!"
4,Quite a soup,"This novel is a most compelling character study. Exhaustive detail, poetic, and quite believeable. A great mellow read for a rainy day in California. One star less than perfect because the characters are exquisitely portrayed in search of a compelling story."
5,Kirkus Schmurkus,"This sort of snotty snobbery is why one can't trust what one might call the Reviewer Community. Among them, Steinbeck has always suffered unjustly, mostly one now suspects, decades after the fact, because he wouldn't play their games. At his most lackluster, which is not the case in The Wayward Bus, he can be a bit of a disappointment. But at his best, whether his important best or his light and airy best, he is really great.This book, while not up to the benchmark set by East of Eden, his greatest if not most ""important"" work, is a great read, a compelling story, told really well. For anyone who has read Tortilla Flat, Sweet Thursday and the rest of Steinbeck's smaller books, this is a good choice for moving ahead on the path to Eden."

1,"Veterinarian's Best Hip & Joint Formula with 500mg. Glucosamine HCL, 90 Chewable Tablets","We purchased this product for our 2 year old Sheltie as he had been on Glucosamine 500mg pills purchased at Walgreens. Our dog hated the overly large pills, even though we split them in half. Apparently the ""flavor"" is not the best since he refused to touch them after the inital dose. We are back to our Walgreens Glucosamine pills hidden in liver sausage, life is good!"
4,"A fine, classic-sounding jazz/swing CD.","3 For All have produced a swinging album that sounds both classic and contemporary. Though not widely known, they are a fine band that is worthy of much more attention."
4,FUNNY,"I like this series, but enjoy it more in small doses, ie 1-2 episodes per sitting. Joan is always sharp and fun, however the series also shows very personal and touching interactions within their family group (incl friends and staff)."
1,Maybe I got a knockoff,This watch could not keep time within a half hour and was not close to being water resistant to any water to include light rain.
3,Not really travel size,"This dryer does the job....BUT...if you're looking for a space saver, this is not it! The handle folds, but it is a full size dryer."
3,too big for travel,"This seems like a great hair dryer. I would consider it for home use in the future. However, it is too big for my liking for travel purposes. I ended up returning it. I can't see taking up this much space in a small suitcase. I wish it were smaller and lighter and I would love it for travel!"
1,smoked,"I hate this hair dryer, and if I wasn't such a procrastinator, I would have returned it. It overheats and shuts off very quickly. I have short, fine hair, so it's not like I am using it for long periods of time."
2,Can't use with diffuser!,"I purchased this almost a year ago to take with me on my trip to Europe.It looks fine, and wouldn't mind packing it into my suitcase. I didn't think that it was abnormally big.What the problem was, and the only reason for giving it just two stars, is that the dryer has two small tubes(?), almost looks as though it's purely for design, that run along the barrel of the dryer. These make it so that the width of the barrel is too wide to accomodate a universal diffuser. I have curly hair and, without being able to find a diffuser to use with this dryer, I can not use the dryer. It is still sitting in my closet, completely unused for a year. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay, as I'd already thrown out the packaging when I received the dryer.If you're not planning on using a diffuser with it, it looks great and seems as though it would work wonderfully!"
3,"Jane and Jay at ""Sleepy's"" Place","Good musicians, good songs, made famous by the Duke of Ellington, but no personality here...really quite boring, not the same ""drive"",as Jane gave us with a quartet in her ""Jam"" disk... I came very close to falling asleep... Music Maven of Deerfield Beach, FL"
3,oops,"Don't know who put a broken comb in the package, but doesn't doo much good with several teeth mising from it. Not a typical amazon packing job thats for sure. So can't give it any higher because I have to buy another one, but it won't be from this seller. Shame because it was going to a be a christmas present and it was actually the nice teal,black,&white; one, not the nasty pink as shown.11/29/12I have updated this comb to 3 stars as i have reordered another comb to replace the original broken one since the return system won't allow for a return of even a broken ""add on item' apparently. Anyway, this time whoever packed the comb just threw it it in loose with again larger heavier items , but luckily the box wasn't thrown around as much i guess as the first one since it arrived w/o damage. Seriously need some work on packing, but I unfairly rated this as a 1 star when Amazon was to blame and not the comb itself. So we stand at a 3 star for the cheapy plastic that breaks easily."
3,C'mon and let me see your jazz hands,"I ordered these shoes because I wanted a durable pair of flats. I have worn dance shoes my entire life, so when I saw these, I assumed that they would have the same amount of great flexibility. I was wrong and they are quite rough on the inside, but it means they are tougher on the outside too. The shoe laces are absolute crap, so you may want to change them out, but it shouldn't be more than $2. The glitter did not fall off to easily, which was surprising. If you want the hipster jazz dance shoe vibe, these are for you!"
4,A Positive Read,"I took Don's seminar on Conquering Your Fear of Cold Calling because I have been having trouble in my new job where I have to cold call. I learned some great ways to make it easier to get to decision-makers. More importantly, I found out that it can be fun for me and a positive experience for the person I reach. The ""Elevator Pitch"" lessons were hilarious. After the seminar ended I bought this book. I read it in two days. There was so much more in the book than the seminar. I recommend it for anyone who needs to reach people they don't know in business or job hunting. Check out Don's seminars as well as this book."
1,zero,What a crap documentary. One of the most interesting stories of the 20th century and these cats made it boring as bread. I do not know what documentary production company produced this.....thing but they should be ashamed.
5,I love it,"There is no smell and the pills are easy to swallow. Great, I love it and would advise to get it."
4,Apron,I love this apron I was looking for one for a long time then I found one on line I need to get an extra one just in case I lose this one
5,My Money was Well Spent,"I am a Somali Court Interpreter in Ontario, Canada.I bought this book online. My money was well spent, ie I am very satisfied with the way this book is written."
5,Powerful Rendition,"The Firebird is done with just the right amount of emotion on this recording. Oftentimes orchestras go ""over the top"" making this piece seem almost trivial. The performance here demonstrates great restraint as well as the power that embodies one of the greatest pieces of music ever written. Stravinsky was more than a genius, he was revolutionary. The Rite of Spring was a shocker to the world, but the Firebird was the beautiful companion."
1,yeah right!,"The Rite of Spring almost sounds good if you have never heard it played by a different orchestra. This disc did not live up to my expectations. If you want an awesome recording, look up Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring, by the Plovdiv Orchestra. You will be amazed!"
4,On Time - Hope that it doesn't break down - again,Have bought this product previously and it lasted about a year - then the spring seemed to fail - and so I've re-ordered it
4,all that i expected,This item is a great conversation starter. A recent visitor was so amazed be this toothpick dispenser that I secretly ordered one for him.
4,Nice,Is's very nice but looks a little cheap. Sometimes it can't get the toothpick but you try again and it does the job.
2,Awesome let down after Car Wheels,"But, that's the way it goes. I guess this album is a tad old and Lucinda's angst had yet to manifest itself. Lyrics immature, voice not quite there - all in all a big disappointment"
2,"be warned--not a great song, and not great quality disc","I was highly disappointed by this Shauna Solomon track--which just doesn't make great use of her voice and diva anthem quality. It's an extremely boring tribal track--and the same goes for the bonus track. The other problem is that this is cheaply made, and has one of those GLUE on labels on the disc! As a result, it stopped reading correctly in my CD player after about 2 tracks."
5,Old School Elegance,"George Burns is truly a class act. I love his subtle humor and terrific sense of timing. He comes across as a warm, witty human being and it's very easy to see why he had so many friends and fans; including, in this very comprehensive collection, Ronald Reagan and Billy Graham. This DVD set is a wonderful compendium of his later work, and makes a great addition to his Gracie Allen pieces. It's the golden age of network tv variety shows, last of its kind. Sure the humor is lightweight and low key, innuendo as opposed to obscenity; well, what's wrong with a kinder, gentler time? Watch, for example, his interplay with Madeline Kahn in the ""girlfriend Rover"" piece; the pacing and mood couldn't be more professional and amusing. Proof that talent and a great attitude will inevitably take you to the top."
3,a great writer getting by,"For an author of Ursula Le Guin's talent and achievement, The Compass Rose is treading water. Even for that, Her Majesty treading water is more entertaining than most authors ""swimming"" their personal best. There are some mind-boggling stories here (The Author of the Acacia Seeds); some amusing stories (Intracom); a fair few toss-offs; and some mere sketches. All the same, it's entertaining reading. Like the best science fiction, some of these stories set the mind searching for how such a world could exist. Unfortunately, too few of these narratives are so provocative. But hey, even the best have their lesser moments.Completists should not be detered. Novices would do better with The Left Hand of Darkness. But no one should doubt this woman's accomplishments regardless of genre."
1,Innova out of business,I bought a Leyse Professional 10-piece stainless steel cookware set in 2003. The 50-year warranty was one attraction. Now the bottom of the dutch oven has developed a bulge and the pot is unusable. I spent a long time searching the web for Innova Inc. to get warranty service. The web addresses I found for Innova Inc. in various business directories were wrong. The phone numbers also did not work. You will also find reports from the Consumer Product Safety Commission with complaints about Innova's exploding frying pans. I finally found a Better Business Bureau report saying that Innova Inc. is out of business. Do not buy this product. 1/12/2012
2,NEW TO SAP/LONGTIME SYSTEM ADMIN,"I have only just started reading about SAP. However, I was looking for more than just a review of GUI screens and the buttons on them. I was looking for explanations, perhaps a short overview. Many of the screen shots did not exactly match the words associated with them. They showed the 'default' SAP screen rather than the parameters and options discussed in the text. There were several mistakes on the screens. Buy another SAP BASIS or SAP Administration book other than this one. It is far overpriced in relation to its content. Others are available at half the price of this used book."
4,Already worth the price,"I just cracked open this book five minutes ago. I'm new to the world of SAP and the aggravation the book has spared me has been well worth the price.This should give you a hint that the book is well-organized and easily accessible. A little familiarity with SAP is handy, but I don't think it's necessary."
4,Great,Terrific book. Its method delivers a unique way to get in touch with your body and the message it is trying to send us.
5,Daphne du Maurier meets Edith Wharton,"This is a fast-paced page turner, full of cliff-hanging chapter endings, written as if the author were really in 1894. The characters, both sympathetic and nasty, are flesh and blood people who do things for comprehensible reasons, and the dialogue is excellent. A compelling, exciting book; find a cozy chair, pour yourself a cup of tea or hot chocolate, and settle down for a terrific time!"
4,A Gem of a Book!,"The author brings late Victorian era New York City to vivid life. I hadn't heard or seen anything on this book when I originally picked this up years ago and didn't know what to expect. What a nice surprise I found within the covers, simply stated I would call it a gem of a book.Although Mario Alfieri is a celebrated tenor awaiting his premier at the Met as the book opens, you do not need an extensive knowledge of opera. When it is touched upon it is never in a heavy handed or intimidating way. On the other side Cohen is able to give the opera fan an enticing historical view of this world. Cohen has the ability to deftly handle Clara Adler's mystery, imbue it with a touch of true Victorian Gothic, and carefully unfolds each layer while building the relationship between Adler and Alfieri. Pick up this little jewel and and you will find yourself totally immersed in the past in this well crafted historical fiction, Gothic mystery, romance."
3,An Entertaining Fairy Tale,This was an entertaining read but not a literary marvel. The plot centers on a mysterious girl and her tribulations as she falls in and out of fortune. The mystery has a few twists but nothing that it unpredictable. I enjoyed it for what it was and would recommend it to my friends as an easy read that was quick moving.
3,Could have been better,"I was looking foward to reading this little book but was somewhat disappointed. While the pictures, quotes, and interesting diaglog were amusing as usual with Chic simple books, it didnt' give absolute information about the best ways to store things."
1,not at all what was expected,"the material is super cheap, you can see through the skirt part of the dress, the sleeves are way too short and the came only comes to mid back. i ended up making my own costume and it was a lot cheaper"
1,costume not in good condition but great service,The dress had a huge rip in it. I did return the dress and was given a credit promptly.
3,Accurate,"I trust this device, but it is very particular with the wrist position to get a reading. It often takes several attempts to get a reading"
4,The perfect bathroom book for English-language junkies.,"""Companion"" well describes this book. People who love Englishfor its own sake can flip open any page and start reading, andsoon find themselves cross-referencing through the whole volume(and learning a lot). Not as essential as a dictionary orstyle guide, but a way to broaden your understanding ofthis marvellous, terrifying language and its relatives. Fortrue language junkies, this is not for the bookshelf, butfor the bathroom, to read in bits at leisure."
4,good product,I've been using these filters since 2005 and never had a problem. i use full synthetic oil though and change my oil every 6k miles or once a year which every comes first. no problems at all.
3,Small circumference,"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14""), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves."
3,Attractive But,The boot is attractive but the pictures make it seem as if the upper portion of the boot is more rigid but in reality it is not rigid at all. More flexible and doesn't look as good as if it was rigid.
4,McBain Thriller,"McBain created his normal murder mystery with his good understanding of criminal investigation, office politics and personnel interactions. As usual he creates a neat mystery with surprise ending."
4,Ed Mc Bain,"""Like Love"" was an enjoyable book. I didn't think it was the best in the 87th Precinct series but I did enjoy it."
5,Fat Loss Monitor,Every finess club should have one of these for their members. It is simple to use and gives a fairly accurate reading of the person's BMI.
1,An accurate device,An accurate device but I'd go for a scale that already had these features. Jody Bissoon
2,Disappointing,"This product must work on averages, because if you are particularly muscular, as are a number of my clients, the BFI rates much too high. I would have sent it back but it was too much trouble."
1,Very Inaccurate,"I currently get my body fat checked by the staff at the gym every 4-6 weeks using the caliper measurement method. Very consistent, very accurate.I bought this in order to track it myself, knowing it wouldn't be perfect, but it is too inaccurate and inconsistent to be useful. My first reading came in at 7%. I'm actually around 14%; a pretty significant difference. I repeated the measurement several times, and over the course of 10 minutes, I had measurements ranging from 7-12% gripping and standing the same way.I tried re-entering my info as both ""Normal"" and ""Athlete"" with the same incorrect/inconsistent results. I also found that by shifting my grip by as little as a half inch in either direction I could get readings as low as 6% and as high as 24%.An overall disappointing purchase, don't be fooled."
4,"Small, simple, gets the job done","From opening the box to taking my first reading took a whopping 5 minutes! Seems about as accurate as one of those Tanita scales, but not nearly as pricey. Looking forward to tracking my progress on body fat. PS, read the manual, particularly the back where they recommend the best times of day to take the most accurate reading."
1,The Body Fat Analyzer is electronic snake oil,"I'll give it one star for being kind of pretty. Oh, and it came with batteries. That's where the positives stop. I do not believe it measures anything significant. It seems to be table based. I started by being honest with the device. I gave it my height of 6'1"", my weight of 170 and my age of 67, a normal level of activity male. It gave me a reading of 17% body fat. There is no way I could have that much fat.I waited a few minutes and decided to change a couple of variables. I changed my age to 21 and my level of activity to athlete but kept weight and height the same. This time my body fat was 5.7%. That number is probably pretty accurate. To get your correct reading how do you know what age and level of activity to enter?If it actually measured % body fat by electrical impedance alone why would it need any information from you?I'll probably get my money's worth by making friends think it works and that they they have a high percentage of body fat."
4,Good so far,"We haven't used it too much, but so far it has been easy to operate and has been consistent with itself."
1,What a Rip Off!,"I was so excited to get this fat analyzer thinking that it would give me accurate information for me and my body size. I input the data regarding my height, weight and age just as it asked, I held on to the handles and it gave me a reading. I agreed with the reading because I know just about where my BMI is for my size. Then I decided to input my ideal height, weight and age as guest #9, just for grins and giggles. So I put these figures in and held on to the handles. I was thinking that it would error out, or something, because surely the ""electrical current"" would find me out to be a liar. It didn't. It gave me an ideal BMI and body fat percentage for the data I inputted. This machine is nothing more than a calculator. Don't waste your money. I saw a BMI/fat analyzer at my local grocery store for $7.99. I bet it's the same thing as this one, only without handles."
4,Perfect,"Though the OMRON body logic fat loss monitor isn't precise in terms of bodyfat %, it will give you a clear estimate, allowing you to track your progression.I recommend it."
5,Omron Body Fat Analyzer Review,This product is great- easy to use- easy to understand! Great for keeping track of your BMI and body fat percentage! This product is found new and the cheapest on Amazon.com.
3,Better than expensive alternatives,I try to stay in shape and work out a lot. I wanted a convenient way to measure my body fat loss. Over the last six weeks I have lost over 20 pounds but this machine indicated that my body fat increased. I know this is not the case. Not sure if I messed up the settings but they are sef explanatory so I feel confident I did it correctly.
4,After 60 or 80?,"I have owned the Omron HBF-306 Body Fat Analyzer for a few years now and find it a useful monitoring fitness tool, but a question I had when I bought the device now becomes an issue.The athletic age mode stops at 60 years of age and the Normal age mode ends at 80 years. So the question is what happens if you are still using the analyzer and you are 61+ or 81+.Does Omron have any adjustment to the analyzer once someone exceeds the programmed age limits?"
3,Better than nothing,"I've used the Omron for a few years now for myself and many others who train at my gym. I must say that after some time of using this device on at least a weekly basis I've grown frustrated with it.It has some pluses:+ easy to use+ catalogs multiple users+ fun for folks+ fast results+ BMI included in results+ long battery lifeHowever, it has some drawbacks as well:+ somewhat inaccurate+ very easy to fool (flexing and hydration both heavily skew the results)+ somewhat inconsistent+ age restrictions (not to be used on the very young or those with pacemakers)+ gives no guidelines for the decision of ""athlete/normal""+ does not function well/at all on those with very low bf%All in all it's a decent scale, and definitely better than nothing. However, I have ordered a spring caliper to use in conjunction with this device and plan on averaging the readings. Till we can get a home water-displacement unit, that'll have to do :D"
2,Not very accurate,"I purchased this item last year to aid in my weight loss goals. Of course, I wasn't pleased with the readout I was getting since I was overweight. I recently got serious about losing weight and have lost 23 lbs. I only have 10 more pounds to go. The Omron tells me that my body fat is the same as when I started. In fact, some of the readings I get are higher than when I started. I have followed the directions to a tee and am still getting different readings every time I use it. In addition, my BMI has remained unchanged. I think the Omron is easy to use and is somewhat accurate, but obviously not as accurate as I had hoped. I think the only way to get a real idea of your body fat and BMI is at the doctor's office or at a gym where they have a water tank."
3,OMRON FAT ANALYZER,"EVERY TIME I USE THIS THING I GET A DIFFERENT READING AND DIFFERENT VALUES... I'M ONLY USING THIS AS A GUIDE TO TELL IF I'M DOING WELL IN MY FAT LOSS GOAL, NOT A VERY ACCURATE ITEM IF YOU ASK ME BUT I DOES KINDA TELL YOU WEATHER YOU ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT OR WRONG DIRECTION."
4,Easy to use; seems fairly accurate,"I have never had my body fat calibrated at the gym or doctor, but my results seem pretty accurate. It is incredibly easy and quick to set up and use. Good supplement to monitoring your weight and fitness progress."
2,Highlyt Inconsistent Readings,"This product gives me a significantly different body fat reading almost every time I use it. One day, my body fat is 27.5%, the next day it is 24.2%. I don't know what results to believe every time I use it. I'll use it 3 times continuously, and the numbers will range from 24.5% to 27% so I don't know exactly what my body fat percentage is."
5,FAT LOSS MONITOR,Easy to program and easy to use. No memory of previous readings but holds settings from reading to reading.
3,Ok not great,-For ease of use it gets 5 starsEasy to set up and use in a matter of 2-3 min-For accuracy it gets 1 starI got readings from too low to calculate to 9% (the later being closer to reality) but most falling between 4 and 7. If you are only tracking change it should be ok if you are consistent with time and stay well hydrated.-Overall 3 starsIts easy but i wouldn't trust it for more than basic monitoring of changes in %.
2,oKAY,I am disappointed in this monitor. I have HBF-514 and the numbers are significantly different for body fat percentage. I believe the HBF-514 is more accurate.
4,Works well,"The only complaint is that I seem to have to reenter my data every time after a weight change, including age and sex. Nice instructions as to when to measure and how to get the most accurate readings."
1,Inaccurate in the extreme,"Never gives the same reading twice, readings vary by 2% from day to day. Worthless, and they've got some nerve for advertising it as being accurate."
1,novelty foriegn junk toy,bought at sports academy. i wieghed 242 Ibs. when i started my body fat was 24.6 lost 52Ibs and now my body fat is 22.0 %. and i have cut abs. and bfi has stayed near the same the whole time. the novelty toy goes off a national average of height and weight. you set at the front and just spits out numbers like a cheap caculator. if i put in there my weight is 130Ibs. it gives you a 11% body fat. junk
1,DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT,This is an expensive novelty toy! I've followed the instructions to the T and the gadget has yet to give a consistent readout. I wish I could get a full refund for this product.
4,Good... I think,"This Body Fat Analyzer is overall a great tool. Great features and usability. And you can't beat the price. The only problem I've found is that it seems to fluctuate from day to day. It's possible my body fat changes from day to day I suppose, but it just makes me wonder how accurate it really is..."
2,inaccurate,"It looks good, but it is inaccurate. When comparing to a pro body fat caliper, the Omron does not measure up the same."
1,Wasn't reliable,"I tried to standardize everything about using this: time of day, hydration, washed hands, etc. But every time I used it I got a different measurement. I wasn't expecting the sort of accuracy that I'd get from gyms and the like, but I wasn't able to even get the same result when I tested 5 minutes apart. Same thing with two friends of mine. Given the high reviews I don't know if mine was just made incorrectly, but I had to send it back."
2,Disappointing,"This book promises a lot but delivers little. What is important and useful is usually sandwiched between too many examples, as if you have to be hit over the head to understand that teamwork is important or that expertise is desireable. Also, some of the examples Cohen uses to convince us are a stretch (he twice refers us to episodes of ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"") and the vast majority of them are based on leaders from the military, which becomes tiresome. Overall, there is not much useful information in this book and there is definitely nothing new."
1,A waste of money,"If you don't already know what's in this book... Go to sleep and get up on the other side of the bed! I mean really. What possible lessons can be learned from advice such as ""You have to be recognized."" I'm hoping the author does a better job as the new Secretary of Defense than he did as a book writer"
5,topnotch,"I was shown this product at a local gunshop, and really liked it, they wanted about $50 for it, found it on amazon for about $37 and its a great deal, fits my P95 perfect, cant even tell you carrying the pistol when you have it holstered , easy to remove from holster, just right"
3,Nice holster but,Nice holster but its not carbon fiber finish and will not work with the 96A1. A1 series has the the accessory rail and will not fit.
2,Good product crappy site.,Ordered this holster for my sig sp 2022. I put in all the correct information and when i received the holster it didnt fit. Took it to my local gun exchange dealer and he actually gave me wholesale price and gave me the correct one (didnt want to deal with paying for return shipping) anyways the CORRECT holster is great. Blackhawk makes great products. The site I ordered from just stinks.
1,don't buy for tuarus PT 1911 AR,It says it fits 1911's with or with out a rail but it will not fit the PT 1911 from taurus had to make major adjustments it is basiclly ruined!!!!
4,Sig 226 MK25,I had read some mixed reviews on if it would fit and it does not... I am trying to see if there is anything I can do to help this fit because its a great holster and I need it for my leg rig... I wish there was a little more explanation on the description when it says Rails or no rails cause the MK25 rails are a true picantanny. SP.Good luck
5,Blackhawk,"Works great! no wobble. smooth going in and out, locks into place. Button release is perfect. Material is nice and durable."
5,It is as good as they say,"I love it, it fit well, stayed close to my body, very form fitting to the hip. I had no probable with running and doing any type of training. I will be buying one for my M&P but it will be the drop leg since I can switch everything back and forth. I will have drop leg, belt, and the paddle attachment. I really like the idea the Blackhawk came up with, I will also be buying the fast attachment for my vest. I would highly recommend this to any law enforcement or civilian because it is the best!"
5,Everyone needs one of these,"At least one of these. Preferably one per sidearm. If you make sure to get the right one for your gun, youll love it. Good, positive engagement and secure fit, plus comes with different adapters for different applications"
2,concealment holster,its not really a concealment holster and it says carbon fiber on the box but both of mine did not have the carbon fiber aplique on it.
5,A MUST HAVE HOLSTER!!!,"IF you have a pistol that the Blackhawk holster will fit, you simply must get this holster! Security, excellent quality and ease of draw are but a few of the features of this outstanding product. Leather pistol holsters are so obsolete with the hammer snap, difficulty of draw and yet the ease of anyone else drawing your pistol are some justifications that come to mind for scrapping all my old holsters and getting this SERPA holster. The provided Belt adjustments keeps the holster from slipping on your belt. You can carry this holster inside or outside your pants with the included attachment and tilt the holster forward and back for your carry preference. This is an excellent product that works for any holster as long as Blackhawk makes one for your pistol."
5,Gun Holster of the Gods,"I really like this gun holster. I'm deployed in Iraq at the moment, and this holster has really made life a little easier here. I'm a staffer and my legs are effing thick. The drop holster gets really annoying, so I purchased this holster to make myself more comfortable. Needless to say, it is more comfortable. Also, it makes for a good choice if you constantly take your weapon on and off (gym, potty breaks, etc.). It doesn't allow for alot of play while wearing it, and it's extremely sturdy. Also, the locking mechanism that holds the weapon in the holster is top notch. I've had no problems with this product."
4,Another good Blackhawk product,The holster met my expectations ... can't wait to take it to camp and see how it performs. We carry a sidearm for snakes and hogs.
5,Great Holster,"Great product for concealed carry , especially if you prefer owb carry. Very durable and sturdy can be used for law enforcement as well suitable for all environments."
3,92a1 wrong color and finish,"I wanted a blackhawk serpa level 2 holster for my beretta 92a1. I ordered this black color carbon finish holster. I revived a grayish ""gun metal"" type color with a flat matte finish serpa level 2 holster. It would only fit a beretta 92fs. My beretta 92a1 did not fit. if you want a level 1 non serpa blackhawk holster for your 92a1 I suggest you get a springfield xdm 9mm blackhawk holster. It fits very snuggle and clean. it does not fit to the shap of the weapon absolutely perfect however it does it the weapon very well. it holds the weapon safe and sung but a very ocd type person would not like that the holster was not made for the beretta."
4,'Almost' Perfect.,"Great little retention holster. Very nice looking, and is adjustable. I wish it was a simple rubber backed paddle design, rather than the (very) inconvenient plastic hooks. Thats the only down side to me, but it does make it more secure, so it's got that going for it...which is nice."
4,As advertised,This holster is as advertised. Belt/Paddle attachment. Cantilevering allows me to make it comfortable for me. Practicing the release will help ensure that you don't trigger the weapon after removal. The only draw back: I would need to wear a fairly robust jacket (as opposed to a shirt) in order to conceal my auto on my hip.
4,Love it!,Definitely love it! It's everything they said it would be! Provides great security!! Love it!!
4,A quality product,"I ordered a Blackhawk SERPA holster with Carbon Fiber finish, both with a paddle and belt clip platform for my Beretta 92 and what I did get instead was a Blackhawk SERPA holster in a gun metal finish with the paddle only. The description was a little misleading but the price was unbeatable. The holster performs just as well but at half the price as the same holster I bought for my 1911. You can always count on Blackhawk for making a quality product."
4,Holster,Very satisfied with this holster. It fits the gun well and with the quick release button it secures the gun great.
5,"Bizarre concept, but excellent book","Even though I have been a fan of Zahn for years and have read most of his books (Star Wars and non-Star Wars) I waited until this one came out in paperback because the concept for the story seemed so bizarre. Suffice it to say that I wish I hadn't waited. Manta's Gift is brilliantly told. Although the lead character (Manta) is an otherworldly Manta Ray-ish creature for about 99% of the story, Zahn does such a fantastic job of character development that you are able to actually buy into the storyline.As always, Zahn is able to take science fiction to a level of enjoyment that few others in the genre can. He does this by mixing elements of other genres (mystery, fantasy, etc) into his story.Overall an outstanding novel."
4,Jupiter Sky Captain,"Timothy Zahn is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. He has a knack for developing characters and story without pausing the fast-paced action that usually occurs in his novels. And having said that, Manta's Gift is not exactly an action novel. This book is more about the ""human condition""; what makes a man a man? Can a man be someone/something else?The mind of paraplegic Matt Raimey is reborn into the body of an alien Qanska living in the skies of Jupiter in order to help humanity and the Qanska understand one another better. There are, of course, ulterior motives for both species, and that is one of the themes of the book. The other is Matt's ability/inability to cope with his new existence. Will he be a human in a Qanska body, will he become a Qanska, or will he become a tool for one species to use against the other?This book was sort of a slow read due to the limited action, but I was never bored and needed to know what was going to happen next."
2,Too little power to do the job,"Disappointing product. I had this for about 1-mos before it died. It started not counting all my steps despite several calibrations and finally died. I couldnt get it open to change the battery so it was a loss all around. I suggest investing in a better, more expensive product with a brand name in order to maintain it when the battery does die."
3,Pedometer with Calorie Counter,"I purchased this because of the Omron name.It is compact, easy to attach and works well... once you understand how to set it.It took several tries,& much fustration before I was able to set it and have it work properly. If you can get thru all that its an OK product"
1,CHECK THE ACCURACY OF THIS PEDOMETER,I bought this a week ago and thought it was great. I was pretty proud to see how much movement I actually got in a day 16000 steps ... UNTIL ... I bothered to check to see if it was counting my steps accurately... I can not get it to take an accurate number. I adjust it and it either counts way too many ....100% error sometimes or stops counting and doesnt count at all...I am looking for another brand now..
2,It was great...until it dropped from my belt onto the floor.,"I though that this was a good deal, and it didn't have the problems that I've had with other pedometers: weak clips, finicky performance, easily reset by accident. It was fine for over three weeks.But then, it fell three feet onto a wooden floor -- I brushed against something, it fell off my belt -- and it's never worked properly since. The internal pendulum is somewhat jammed against something else inside, so now it won't reliably register my steps.So while this pedometer has many advantages over other models in a similar price range, it was much more vulnerable to a drop on the floor than the others I've had."
4,works fine,i have been using a pedometer for sometime and find this brand is easy to use and does what I need it to. I do wish the battery life was longer and batteries were not so expensive.
5,Perfect for me!,"I love this pedometer and it has made me painfully aware of how little activity I was doing prior to getting it. This has made me accountable to get out and move more. It is pretty accurate, I took it out with the pedometer on my i-phone and compared the two and they are very similar. It counts calories, aerobic steps, and keeps a 7 day memory log of all your steps. I am proud to say I am averaging around 20,000 steps a day. It used to be under 5000. I really do move a lot more."
1,Wrong item sent,"I ordered two OMROM 105s and received two BP pedometers. I had used the OMRON 105 for the past two years and was very satisfied with it until I lost it. The BP does not have the aerobic function and does not have the 7 day memory feature. It is quite variable in recording steps as well. Therefore, I am most dissatisfied. I don't understand why the product was substituted without notifying me. I have reordered the OMRON 105s and I am hoping that I will receive the correct item this time.Linda JB"
4,Pretty good but...,"I bought mine at a grocery store awhile back. It works great, but I'm not sure its accurate. I had an older pedometer, different brand, and when I wore them both at the same time, the Omron pedometer was way ahead of the other as far as steps. While this is great, I'm just not sure I really walked that many steps, or if maybe the other one was inaccurate. Anyway, it's very convenient in that it resets itself every day, stays on really well, and keeps a 7 day history. Certainly not bad for the money."
4,Good quality Good price,I've had this pedometer for about 2 months now. It's great. Easy to set up for your stride. I love that it counts regular steps and aerobic steps. It's a great little pedometer.
3,Not what I really wanted,"I wanted something SIMPLE to count steps. I couldn't find anything so settled on this one. It has other features, but my biggest complaint is ""setup"". I can't figure it out, so I'm hoping my son will be able to do it for me. I just wanted basic, not complicated and you can't find simple basic things anymore. Technology can be over done sometimes. I may come back and let you know how well it works, once I get someone to set it up for me."
2,Dead as a door nail,"We bought 75 pedometers for a wellness program for our organization. Within two weeks, they started ""dying"". An email to the customer service department at the company produced 10 new batteries to replace dead ones. But as the plague of ""deaths"" continued, we sent numerous emails for more batteries. If you choose to purchase this pedometer, be prepared to replace the battery in a matter of weeks...and don't count on much of a response from Customer Service. After an hour and half on the phone, there was still no resolution to our problem."
4,measurable success,"It is GREAT to be able to QUANTIFY your ""steps for the day"" and check out other benefits. I like the way it is small and unobtrusive on the waistband. I like the week's worth of data. I like the way it clears itself at midnight and starts the new day.I found it hard/time-consuming to set the original parameters. Once it fell (into water) and I had to re-enter the data. Bummer.My walking friends now are interested in getting pedometers of their own. It is fun to have new ways of motivating yourself and others."
3,Digital pedometer HJ-105,Sometimes shows wrong number of steps walked.Difficult to set up a lenghth of a step.
2,Omron HJ 105 Standard Step Pedometer - NOT VERY ACCURATE,"The Omron HJ 105 Standard Step Pedometer is adjustable for sensitivity. But mine is way too sensitive - no matter what the sensitivity setting is set on.It is approximately 24% in error of counting my steps.And that translates to nearly a 1/2 mile error for a two mile walk. I can compensate by setting my stride to a 25 % smaller number, to make the miles come out closer, but the step count is always too high.This might be acceptable for some people, but I think it is nearly unacceptable."
4,Omron Pedometer,Great product and very accurate. I just wish it was able to calculate steps and calories at the same time.
4,Quality item,"For the most part, this is a great pedometer. Sometimes it gets a little temperamental but for the most part it is great. It displays the number of steps along with the time. It also let you know how many aerobic steps you have for the day (you'd be surprised how difficult it is to rack up aerobic steps). This is a great pedometer. Relatively easy to set up and fairly reliable. Be sure to get extra batteries. They don't seem to last long (only about 4 months, for the first one I had) but don't let that discourage you (since I got my first one, I have ordered 4 more since this is such a great pedometer)."
4,Great for the Price,"Pros: small, lightweight, attaches well, protected from accidental resetting by closed case, accurate ( but counter sensitivity needs occasional checking)Cons: it fell into water briefly, once, and died. The aerobic step counter stops timing if you stop a couple of times or change directions a lot.Over all it's accurate and works very well, also has good instructions (a rare treat). It's a great bargain, especially for me, as I lose these things sooner or later."
2,I've never even successfully used it.,"I attempted getting it calibrated, switching it different places on my person, etc. I couldn't get it to give me an accurate reading - and haven't successfully used it yet. My husband may have had better luck - I say try a more expensive model, but maybe I'm just not doing it right?"
4,Better than most,This is the best pedometer I've owned and I've owned a few. First of all it has a good clip on it so that it doesn't fall off! It resets automatically and seems to be more accurate than others I've used.
4,Omron HJ-105 Pedometer,"It was very difficult to write a review for this product. On one hand, it performs well and is well worth its price. On the other hand, it has a cheap feel to it and it is a bit clumsy (inconvenient) to use. Bottom line: I wish I had paid the few extra dollars for the Omron HJ-112, which probably would have met my expectations better."
2,"Seens to work OK, but the Omron HJ-112 is MUCH better","This product has a very ""toy like"" feel. The case is flimsy, the buttons feel funny, just toy-like. It only works when positioned horizontally onyour belt. Seems to work OK, but don't dare drop it or it'll break. The light plastic case has a heavy metal weight glued inside.Why not spend $8 more for the superb Omron HJ-112? The HJ-112 has dual pendulums inside so it counts accurately whether on your belt or in your pocket. And it's built like a tank."
5,Economical pedometer,Second purchase - liked first one so well. Great price and easy to use. I love all the features. I would recommend this purchase to all.
1,very disappointed,"Accurate when it works but that's been very intermittently. Continually resets in the middle of the day so can't keep track of anything, then started freezing on me. Only thing I could do was readjust the battery but the battery compartment is IMPOSSIBLE to open. Tried with numerous different size screwdrivers and ended up stripping the screw & finally breaking it open just to reset the thing. Now held together by tape which is ridiculous. A complete waste of money."
1,It doesn't work,"As instructed, I pulled the plastic tab from the battery and nothing happened. Can't get it to set. Perhaps it's a bad battery. At under $12, I expected it to look and feel pretty cheap (it does), buexhaled it would at least turn on."
1,Not Accurate for Running,"I thought this had a heart monitor. SMALL Display. The Calorie Burnt Counter is Kcal vs regular calories. I ran on the treadmill and compared my Calories burned and Distance and it was VERY OFF! Overall the pedometer said I only burned 83 kcal I ran for 30 mins and walked for 15 mins = 45 mins total in which the treadmill stated I burned 400 Calories. You must also calculate the kcal according to your age, but my results did not come close to the treadmill measurements. Dissapointed. I bought this because of the reviews on how accurate it is. But it's not. Have you compared it to something else? a bike or a treadmill?"
1,"Full of features, but inaccurate step counting","Pedometer has tons of great features that would all be really neat and useful IF it could accurately count steps. I clipped it on to my belt, walked 30 steps, then checked the reading - 4 steps counted. Useless!"
2,Unreliable,"When it works, it's fine. Unfortunately, it occasionally loses the settings and memory. I have been unable to determine the reason."
2,overly sensitive,"for the price I was pleased. And the first few days I used it, it keep steps perfectly. But now several months later, It over counts no matter how much I adjust it! And dont even think about using it at home..."
3,Good except for the clip,"Small, easy to use, accurate enough, but the clip is very, very easy to knock off. I have dropped it several times, and finally sent it flying into a bucket of water. It may recover when dry (or may not), but I would like a much better fastening mechanism."
1,Couldn't even test it out for a full 24 hours!,The sensitivity settings are inconsistent. The clip is useless-- I lost the pedometer before I even had it on for a full day. I do not recommend this one.
4,"Works well, until battery dies","I purchased this at my local Walgreens. It worked so well, I bought one for my mother also. We both wore them daily...until the battery died. The screw is so small, you can't get it out to change the battery! I wish I was able to change it, because this is a small, quiet, convenient pedometer."
2,very entry level,Item doesn't keep accurate count of steps even when using the adjustment switch. From size and ease - item is nice. I just wished it was more accurate.
2,Worked great... for a month,"I used this every day and it seemed to b working great. Then about a month after I got the pedometer, it just stopped counting steps.I would have given it just one star, but like I said, it seemed to work great for the short period of time that it did work."
5,a chilling vision of the future,lethe is a chilling vision of the 22th century.biological experiments have given us mutants andthe normal people live underground. Brains in jarrule mankind. Sullivan weaves a story of two worlds earth and a colony planet both victims ofman's crimes against nature.
5,Quite a mash up!,"I stream a flamenco radio station from Andalucia when I'm on the computer and heard a cut from this album (thank heavens that they post real time programming notes!). I had to hear more. I dance to and love both Arabic (bellydance) and flamenco so this album offers a lot. It is a little more polished in some places than others which I don't consider a 'good thing,' preferring the grittier side of both.I also would consider it a bit more of a ""mash up"" than a clear expression of the Arabic influences on flamenco music. Not sure that is a crystalline expression of the contents, but the way that it felt to me.It a great addition to broad flamenco library."
5,A really interesting read,An interesting and well written book. Many thanks to the author Nick Ryan - this vivid account of his experience with the far right took me right out of my comfort zone. Thank you!
5,"Minimal, eerie, techno-ish","Not only is Ergo Proxy an awesome anime, but it has one killer soundtrack as well. This is mostly eerie minimal techno, but there is some rock thrown in as well. Track 2, Kiri, is the full version of the opening song for the show, which by the way is one of the most memorable anime intros i've ever seen. If you like this, then you should think about getting ahold of Opus 02, which as of this date, is only available through a Best Buy exclusive (in the USA, at least). Troubling enough, the US version does not have the ending song by Radiohead. I guess Geneon couldn't gain the rights in America for some reason."
3,Silent Partner,"While I love Jonathan Kellerman and his Alex Delaware, this book was so convoluted it was difficult to develop any sympathy for any of the characters. There were so many characters floating in and out it was a little hard to keep them straight. A good read, nonetheless, and typical of his twists and turns."
5,Faith is a lucky woman......,"if JK does it as well as he writes it! Sex, that is. wow! But besides being the best soft porn I have read in years, this is a masterpiece of the craft we call writing. Do not give much attention to the negative reviews....just buy it and enjoy!"
3,Not is best!,"I like Kellerman. That said, I was taken aback by this book. His long description of woman were very tiredsome and one sex scene got my thinking he was writing his own sexual fantasy. I would not recommend that book, skip to the next one."
4,Kellerman Family Fan,"I enjoyed the book as I always enjoy Kellerman, though they are all pretty much the same. I read them anyway and I wonder why Alex lets Robin walk all over him. Anyway, it was worth the read. I like the Faye Kellerman books as well and have them all as well. I would suggest a reader would enjoy this book, but my husband did not. He reads macho books or humourous books and Kellerman could not maintain his interest. I will keep reading all the Kellerman's. I feel I've gotten to far along to quit and a Blockbuster may turn up one day."
2,too explicet for my tastes,"i'm a grandmother and have lived a lively life, not a prude at all, but did not expect this from such a great writer!!! love all his other books"
4,Complex and involving,"This is one of a series of books which features Dr.Alex Delaware, a young, handsome and wealthy psychologist. At a rather ritzy party, he meets Sharon, an incredibly beautiful young psychologist with whom he had a brief fling some years previously. Drawn to her despite many misgivings, he is caught up in a web of lies, deceit and intrigue which culminate in several gruesome murders. The plot involves a now deceased but sinister mega millionaire who is a direct copy of Howard Hughes, complete with matted beard, long, filthy fingernails and all of his unattractive anal retention habits. The story becomes more and more involved, using identical triplet sisters, mentally retarded carers and a Svengali like therapist who controls Sharon. At times I was muttering""hurry up and get on with it"" but, in all, an entertaining read."
1,Just Awlful,One of the most poorly written books I've ever tried to read and I have been reading for sixty years. Had to give up and throw it away after little more than half of the book. Maybe Johnthan Kellerman should just hang it up. Wasted my money.
3,Touch & Go,"The Alex Delaware series is one of the best-written detective series available, so when a book doesn't quite meet the standard fans really notice. All the prior 3-star reviews are spot-on. This book, while not exactly a stinker, if far from the qualityJ. Kellerman fans are used to. I won't belabor readers with a synopsis of the convoluted plot. Suffice to say it would help to take notes or have a highlighter ready to keep track of the many & varied twists & unbelievable characters.I really wish Kellerman would get rid of the annoying & narcissistic Robin. She is overly self-involved and certainly does not deserve a thoughtful & loving partner like Alex. I would like to see Delaware with a more interesting and involved partner or no partner at all. Just date some of the interesting women he meets along the way.If you're a Delaware/Sturgis fan, leave this one till last."
3,"Interesting, quick read that fell apart at the end","While this book kept me fully captivated, waiting to see what happened next, Mr. Kellerman's work seemed a bit shaky when it came to the conclusion and wrap up section. It was too easy a fix, and became rather unbelievable at the end."
3,"ok, but......","i enjoy the kellerman novels, but this one was a slight disappointment. a bit meandering, a little overwritten, several flashbacks, and with the most exciting interpersonal dynamics and scenes involving the antagonists being revealed, barely, in retrospective conversation. and finally, are they twins?, triplets?, multiple personalities?, borderlines verging on psychotic?, on and on and on. who knows? after 450 pages, one doesn't much care. with a *who's on first??* narrative that was not very enjoyable, but kind of irritating. what little psychological suspense there is, is eclipsed by the extended series of closing scenes. i hope the next one is tighter. by the way, the length of the novel, for a mystery was not a problem at all, it was a content issue."
2,Disappointing,"Readers who know other Jonathan Kellerman novels may be just a little bit disappointed. This one is on the one hand pretty simple as far as the action is concerned. But the plot is not really conceivable, the events are sometimes too far away from any acceptable reality, the psychology is more related to that of a Sidney Sheldon novel than to that of a professional. The ending is illogical, and the origins and the upbringing of Sharon are simply improbable.But nevertheless, the story is suspenseful and by no means boring. But this is the only credit I can give it. Kellerman has done a lot better in his other books - at least those I know. He may be forgiven this one."
3,Not What I Expected A'tall...,"Well, even though the alex Delaware series has me hooked, 'Silent Partner' wasn't what I expected it to be.... I like the main idea for the book, good twin/bad twin, etc, But it kinda rambled at times, and i found myself losing attention with some parts. So in short, this book was alright. Although I like every other J. Kellerman book I've read, I found Silent Partner to be not as good as the others he's written. Ja ne! -Sheena"
4,"I enjoyed it, but...","This one is somewhat different than the usual Alex Delaware novel in that Delaware is much more personally involved--so much of the story is his history as well as the dead(?) ex-lover's. A few times I had lapses of memory and did not know of which woman he was speaking--my bad.As with all the other Kellerman novels, it was a quick and enjoyable read. Bring us more!"
3,Too much psychiatry,"The book is ejoyable but I find myself falling asleep with all the detailed, psychiatric explanations of split personalities. Maybe I have missed some important point."
3,"Interesting plot, cheesy ending","I found the narrative had pace and rarely became tedious. There was a diverse range of characters and gripping interactions between them. However, it seemed to me as if Kellerman run out of ideas before the end and hurried off the last couple of chapters. This left me rather disappointed, but still wanting to read more of his work."
4,Try this,"Kellerman is a great story teller and if you like murder mystery you won't be disappointed, so pick this up and get started"
3,Not quite up to the others,It was readable but only just. Not nearly as good as his two previous Alex Delaware mysteries. I did finish it though!
4,Many Surprises,"Ketterman delves into the mystery of the unique connection between twins and multiple births through his main character, Dr. Delaware. This psychological thriller spins us through the world of those who treat the human mind.Sex of all makes and models being one of the most discussed subjects on any psychologist's couch is a theme that weaves throughout this complicated ""who done it"". Twists, turns and surprises keeps the reader turning the page. A fascinating read."
3,ALEX DELAWARE ** BOOK FOUR,"I think this is the fourth book in the series and while complex, it wasn't all that great. The weakest of the first four books to me. Delaware is just so hooked on solving the death/suicide of an old flame, it's like obsession. Who cares? Sure back ground is given but the story is so hard to follow. By the end it is easy to be lost. Will stay with Delaware but can't recommend this one"
5,SFdS Treatise on the Love of God,I am very pleased witht this book. It is what I expected and more. I plan to refer to it frequently.
5,THE BEST ACTION FLICK.........,"I've seen in a long while. Not real crazy about Cage's performance, but the plot is very good. Ed Harris, once again, outshines them all in a spectacular display as Gen. Hummel. The action starts with a bang and does not let up. I highly recommend this one to any action ""freak"". Happy viewing!!!"
3,Not Exactly An Accurate Picture...,"Taken simply as a fast-paced shoot-'em-up action thriller, this film works well enough. But the actions and motivations behind Ed Harris (General Hummel) and the Force Recon marines who side with him leave much to be desired. A few simple facts for those interested:Marines volunteer for Force Recon, and they do so with full knowledge of the risks and sacrifices being asked of them, including annonimity. These gentlemen are not in the military for college benefits. They are warriors, and have chosen to live - and die, if needed - in a warrior culture. So the idea that a high-ranking officer and active members would desert and become terrorists is both ridiculous and repugnant, for to do so would betray the honor and sacrifice of the men who had died in combat."
1,Lasted one year,"Our DeLonghi dehumidifier performed sort of acceptably, though not especially well, for slightly over a year - that is, until slightly past the expiration of the full warranty. After that, the 'full tank' shutoff control ceased to function, remaining locked in 'full' mode, sounding a continuous alarm, and shutting off any dehumidification. This control had been dubious for some time, and required careful positioning of the tank, sometimes repeated repositioning, in order for the unit to operate. All in all, a substandard product."
1,Not what the picture depicts,The picture showed rolls of Omron printer paper than were a lot larger than what I received. I was very disapointed when I received the order. To my surprise I expected a box when I picked up at the UPS office instead the shipper sent the 5 rolls in a 9 X 10 envelope. Will not order from this company again. Buyer beware as they say.
4,Omron,"I tried printing my readings on regular paper and it did not work. However, when I went back to Omron Thermal Printing Paper for Blood Pressure Monitors it printed nicely."
2,Post are large,The earrings are pretty; however I do have trouble inserting in my ear as the posts are large
2,Incoherent,"This is the only text on continuum physics that I have used, so I cannot compare it to others on that subject specifically, but I can say that this is the worst physics text I have ever encountered. It is next to impossible to actually learn from this book."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"Nature's Way Hydraplenish with MSM, 60 Vcaps have significantly eased the discomfort in my knee...I feel that soon I will be walking in total comfort..."
3,Good for joints,"I use this product to keep my joints hydrated since my body does not make its own joint fluid any more. I noticed a difference within a month of starting, and I have continued to maintain the effects. Make sure to get the MSM. I got the one without MSM by mistake once and noticed a difference almost immediately."
5,excelente muestra de la nueva generacion musical de brasil,"lenine es una de las mayores y mas gratas revelaciones de toda una nueva camada de musicos de brasil. En una epoca de ""globalizacion"" la musica de brasil nos muestra, con este cantante, en todos sus cd, como se puede evolucionar, incorporar elementos de rock, y seguir siendo tan brasilero como el mas puro samba. Lenine es un cantautor de excepcion, para tener y escuchar con infinito placer. Este cd lo demuestra a la perfeccion, para todos los que amamos la musica latina y en especial la brasilera."
3,Very nice album! Real music new experience!!,"At first, I heard about a guy called Lenine, composer, musician, But I wasn't feeling like buying one of his cd. And accidentally heard his album called 'Falange Canibal', and I felt in love about his music. It's a great experience, new methods of compousing music, new harmonies. Nothing is the same, every track is a new sound. A sound coming from the dayly experience, lived in a big town with a lot of contrasts. Very brazilian music, openned for the future. Very Good. Must have."
5,Delightful,This book is enjoyable both for its beautiful descriptions of flight and an evocative account of the Lindberghs' experience in a small British colony in Africa in the 1930s.
3,Aubrey/Maturin Novels Are Always Entertaining,"I discovered Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels years ago after hearing a story about them on NPR. ""Desolation Island"" is the fifth novel in the series I have read. While the 19th century English naval jargon is at times distracting, the characters are engaging and the stories filled with excitement, intrigue and modest romance. O'Brian delivers intelligent nautical tales filled with history, heroism and humanity.To increase my enjoyment of the novels, I purchased a companion edition that elucidates the types of ships, sails, rigging, and navy personnel they contain."
4,Enjoyed It Overall,"I've heard of Patrick O'Brian for many years, but not until now have I ventured into a book of his. Overall, I'd say this is pretty good historical fiction. I do have some complaints. The first half could use a little more action. And the pace gets rather erratic at times. However, by no means do I want to say that this severely denigrates the overall quality of the book. It's a fine book and you might very well enjoy it, especially if you are accustomed to old naval terminology."
4,Many of the best elements of the series are present in this volume,"If Patrick O'Brian had a menu of topics to include in a possible Aubrey/Maturin book, he put many of my favorites in this one. I'm not particularly fond of the Jack-on-land subplots, and this book doesn't dally too much at the homestead, and what does happen there is amusing. I love a good chase, and this has one of my favorites from the series, with a devastating outcome. I love a tale of survival under extreme conditions, and this has a great one -- the seamanship of the Royal Navy is such that they could probably make a functional sailing vessel out of a two-by-four. I love when Stephen has to get all spy-sneaky, even when he hates it; this is the first book in the series to really focus on that. I love scurvy and the search for antiscorbutics. In sum, a satisfying read, after which I did not feel the need to dive right into the next book for a while."
5,a deserted island in the Great South Sea,"A deserted island provides the respite for the crew of ""the miserable old Leopard."" Driven far south into the edge of the Antartic Sea, the leaking Leopard limps into a forlorn haven to fill up on sea birds eggs and seals, while trying to rebuild their ship into something that will sail. They soon discover that they are not quite alone. The drama and tension build to a fine boiling pitch before reaching a satisfactory conclusion. A master work of writing."
5,High adventure and peril on the seas,"The Aubrey-Maturin novels are an incredible achievement, a chronicle of adventure during the Napoleonic Wars that also manages to be a continuing, dense, and complex novel of character. This is in my opinion one of the best in the series, with Captain Aubrey facing not only hostile ships but also the dangers of the Southern seas, including Antarctic storms, icebergs, a near mutiny, and a shipwreck on the deserted island of the title. His colleague Stephen Maturin, spy and naturalist, is at his best, alternately humorous (in the old meaning of the word) and quietly courageous. Highly recommended"
5,Can it get any better?,"There are many unforgettable passages in the Aubry / Maturin series - and this book contains some of the best! This is a beautiful story and much more than just a great escape (but you won't be able to put it down). This is a great tale of survival, humanity, and ingenuity."
5,Patrick O'Brian and the English tongue,"The Aubrey/Maturin series is often compared to Horatio Hornblower and other series of sea-going adventure tales, but that's not what it's about. If O'Brian wrote about knitting or quilting, you wouldn't want to miss a word. His writing is all about the use of the English language, and a page of O'Brian is a luxury for the lover of words to soak in, adventure and the sea aside."
5,Best starter novel for O'Brian series.,"When I start talking to people who want to get into the Patrick O'Brian series, I always recommend that they read Desolation Island first. Somehow this novel stands on it's own more than any of O'Brian's Aubrey Maturin series. You get you a superior novel without having to have read the earlier books. Desolation Island displays the splendor of O'Brian's writing, tells a gripping story, plus it makes you feel like an insider in O'Brian's world when you go back and read Master and Commander and then you are totally hooked from Chapter One!Geoff Hunt: Portrait of a Marine ArtistExtensively shows how Geoff painted the cover for this book. Tells what it was like working with O'BrianGeoff Hunt: Painting in the StudioGeoff painted all of O'Brian's covers - incredible artist!High Seas Schooner: Voyage of the Harvey GamageAward winning documentary shot in heavy seas in the North Atlantic."
5,Great read about a terrible trip,"I have been reding the series through starting with master and commander. Desolation Island and The Maritius Command are both fast paced and hard to put down. the story moves along well and reding it I can see much of it is setting the reader up for future adventures with Aubrey and Maturin. Both of these books move at Sea and give great insight into political and military strategies of the Napoleonic world, but don't get overly stuck in domestic (home life) and the social mores of the day which make Post Captain an Treason's Harbor(which I read out of order) move slowly and somewhat of a struggle to read.I have just gotten Fortune of War and hope that it will be as good as Desolations Island."
4,red,"This red licorice arrived all individuality packed , so it was very fresh , takes a lot of chewing -mild red flavor . . . not twizzlers."
2,Blech...like plastic,"I can't believe these things have such great reviews! I was hoping these would be good because I had organic jelly beans and they are delicious. However, these tasted like wax/plastic. There was barely any flavor. No thank you."
1,eeewwww,"Hard, tough, pasty aftertaste. Like gnawing on a rubber hose but with a less pleasant flavor. Somewhere in the back of that just woke up in the morning and scraped it off your teeth taste there was a lingering strawberryish flavor. An unripe and turned slightly bad strawberryish flavor with not a hint of sweetness. These were awful. So bad I couldn't swallow the bite I took. It was such a disappointment since I was really excited to get these after Runningrabbit stopped making the good stuff. If I fed these to my kids they would report me to CPS. I want to pull them out of the package and whip the CEO with them as punishment. If I'd never had candy in my life these would still taste terrible! Did I mention they aren't good.? Seriously, if you are looking for something that tastes anything like a red vine or any type of licorice this isn't it."
3,Good bass but missing high end treble,"I used this Sony speakers for my surround sound system. I paired it with a Sony center channel to get better sound matching. It is important to have speakers with similiar output and frequency matching. The low end bass is deep but not ""thumpy"". I wish it can produce clearer ""high"" since listening to music CDs is not quite as good as my old JBL speakers. Overall, it is a decent speaker for low end system."
3,Good book but not so much for the lay person...,"That is why I gave it 3 stars. I was going to purchase a different book but this one was highly recommended over the other book, that it was better, wish I would have gotten both at the same time. This is a great book for someone more advanced than I am."
5,I wear nothing but ...,Just a line to say how comfortable these shoes are. Anyone who has ever put ECCO shoes on their feet know this to be true. I am truly singing to the choir but to those that are considering a purchase of ECCO shoes...do it! You owe it to yourself and your feet!
5,Most comfortable Ecco ever,I have been wearing Ecco's since 1995. They are the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn. The Neoflexor Oxford may be the best ever.
3,not available in wide or double wide,I made the mistake in ordering these in the wrong width size. They are great shoes if you have narrow feet or can wear mediums. Too bad for me but I found another brand instead.
4,An engaging account of how the Soviet espionage system worked,"While this book is slightly dated (almost anything about the Soviet Union is, by definition) this is a well-written account of how the Soviet espionage system (both inside and out of the USSR) worked."
3,Just ok,"Mini's character was definitely a sociopath, and I found myself disgusted by her at times. There were a few things about the movie that didn't make sense to me, such as why they were planning on pursuing a ""relationship"" instead of just leaving it at a casual fling. So because they want a relationship, they come up with ways to get rid of her mother. The whole thing could have been avoided if they had just understood the fact that it was just a little affair and she was eventually going to move out and move on. Going through all the trouble of drugging her mother seemed unrealistic to me. I also didn't understand why when they found her they didn't just leave her to overdose and then say she was a pill user. Instead they decide to make it look like a suicide by putting her in the car, which ends up incriminating them. The whole time I was watching the movie I kept thinking ""You guys are so stupid! Don't do that!"""
5,Mini's First Time... GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!,best movie ever released... i love every minute of this twisted and extremely entertaining flick. buy it asap- it should be apart of everyone's private movie collection.
5,Mini's First Time is a great movie,I loved the acting in this movie by Alec Baldwin. A good movie to watch I love the story line and the acting by everyone was great. The soundtrack too is good!
3,"quite exciting, but with shades of overdoing it","A delicious, albeit rather predictable thriller, this movie is as entertaining as it is well acted. With strong performances from Alec Baldwin and Carrie-Anne Moss as well as more promise from the now grown up Nikki Reid, this movie also has an amusing cameo by Jeff Goldblum."
5,GOOD MOVIE,Alex Baldwin is real good in this movie. I found this to be a seriously underrated movie. I would say this is a definite must see movie.
3,Provocative with tinges of dark humor,"Alec Baldwin delivers an above average performance in this movie, but that isn't what lifts this movie out of the doldrums...its Nikki Reed's amazing performance as a sexually voracious teenager who is amoral to the point of being homicidal. Nikki Reed plays a high school senior by day, and a call girl by night, which is a profession purely picked by choice, as she isn't exactly desperate for money. Her family life though leaves much to be desired, as her mother [Carrie Anne Moss] is a high-strung, drug and alcohol addled woman, who can't really figure out what's going on around her. It doesn't take too long before Mini gets her stepfather [Alec Baldwin] as a client, and the plot gets steamier and more convoluted from that point...I wouldn't say its compelling, but it merits a watch, if only for Baldwin's and Reed's performances."
5,Tough-guy chivalry gone awry -- great stuff!,"If you'd like to see a hard-hitting, adult, funny and emotionally charged drama -- this one will give you full satisfaction! It's a breath of fresh air to come across stuff like this once in a while. Tough guy movies CAN go beyond fake gun-play, fake looking fights, and characters with the complexity of a hamster. Desolation Angels has also won a few top Indy awards (no surprise there) -- check it out!"
1,THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"I saw this movie at the Film Forum in New York City a number of years ago.45 minutes into the film I got up and walked out. In my entire movie going experience I have never asked for my money back, but this movie was so bad I felt it warranted. I can't believe this thing actually won awards, let alone is out on VHS or DVD!"
2,Very muddled recording,I found this recording to be very muddled. The location (I do not have the CD at hand) added so much reverberation that it was hard to even pick out the soloist at times. Perhaps they should have done this recording in a studio to get better acoustics. As An example of what I would prefer is the Opus 9 by I Musici on the Phillips label
2,hardly his legacy,"some of the stories here are not in any way connected to Lovecraft. Wolfe's story here is interesting, but doesn't really get to be horrible. a story about out-of-the-body experiences is pretty good, but something seems amiss in the ending. a story about a stuffed animal amused me. also included are some mediocre stories, and also some really dull stories. the collection is perhaps not the worst in history, but you can easily do better."
5,Well done Indie,"Saw this at the Boston Independent Film Fest last year. At times tense and at times hilarious, it takes sibling rivalry to a new height as two brothers emotionally wrestle for a woman's affection. Great characters, well acted, finely directed."
5,Very warm & comfortable,I bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so I decided to buy a pair for myself. I wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable--i think wearing socks w/ these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet.
5,Uggs,Had to buy a mens size 11 for my daughter since no one has size 12 Uggs in stock. She loves them and they fit great.
5,boots,"good service and quick shipment.will buy again when needed,boot's fit great, just like my old one's[after a few day's]."
1,Not the quality product they used to be,I bought these to replace another pair which finally wore out after 13 years of use. The rear seam of one of these new boots split wide open while i was trying them on. The sole isn't what it used to be and the boots weigh half as much. I sent them back and got emu boots which i like much better for less money
5,The mr. Loves them !,Got these for my husband after he wrecked a pair of mine trying to wear them ! Now he has his own pair and stays away from mine !
3,"good if you want it, but has shortcomings!","this latest effort from theodis is fairly well documented with covers that sound good, but a distortion quality prevails throughout. the guitar playing seems basic enough, but the audio quality leaves a lot to be deired.""meet me in the morning"", the opening track drags on and the second track has a lead effort that makes its point early, but keeps on and on and becomes pointless. finally, who needs another version of ""stagger lee""? i'd vote to leave it alone, but there are worse recordings. recommended if you haven't heard the man."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"Whoa, Im the first person ever to review this cd?! Good. Okay, this album sounded very good to me. I brought the album after hearing my favorite song on the computer, which was 'Forelash'. But still, the whole album is great. It dosen't seem like Obo isn't around anymore,(even though I think he was a good artist). I hope people can listen to this album and see if it was good. I think it is. Great job Obo."
2,not plain red,"I bought it thinking red one was just red, but it has a kind of a white? trim, so instead of elegant it looks suitable for a gipsy costume."
5,Yummmm,Everyone loves these! They sell really well in our candy machine and store well too. I will definitely purchase again!
4,For the practically minded pastor,"Bisagno is an incredibly experienced and gifted pastor of God. He shares his wisdom and experiences throughout the ministry of his life in ""Letters to Timothy,"" and provides a solid A to Z guide for situations and issues that many pastors will face. Though some of his writing is geared toward larger churches, both first time pastors and lifetime pastors will be able to glean practical wisdom and principles for a biblically sound ministry philosophy within the pages of this book."
2,Letters to Timothy (or How to Run a Church Like a Business),"As a life-long Baptist I always believed Baptist pastors and Baptist Churches were different from business and social leaders and their organizations, but this book shows me IT AIN'T SO!I have read business leadership manuals that weren't as ""businessy"" as this handbook for pastors. Critics of organized religion will find much support in the book.It is probably a must read for young Baptist pastors, but I couldn't recommend it for the laity, unless you enjoy being disillusioned."
1,How to make money with your church,This book is an outrage! What next? Saddleback Franchises? Sell stock in your church? Absolutely horrid book.
4,A great classroom resource!,"I have used the book ""Animals Without Backbones"" for 5 years now in my Honors Zoology class here in Maryland. This text is great - it is easy to read and understand and the photos are fabulous! The only thing is that all the pictures are black and white, unlike the ""fancy"" new biology books. It reads at a level lower than my students, which are honors juniors and seniors. I give them additional information to supplement their studies, but I can't say enough about the photos and the labelled diagrams! A great book!"
5,The best book for Invertebrate Zoology,"As a new teacher of Zoology, this book has become my most valuable resource for the invertebrates. The information is easy to understand and the labeled photos are wonderful. If I could chose a textbook for my students, this would definitely be it. My students have also found it to be a great resource for their studies."
4,"Debussy: Cuarteto de cuerdas en sol menor, Op. 10; Zemlinsky: Cuarteto de cuerdas No. 2, Op. 15","Debussy: Cuarteto de cuerdas en sol menor, Op. 10; Zemlinsky: Cuarteto de cuerdas No. 2, Op. 15 is a 2004 Harmonia Mundi recording featuring Cuarteto Casals. Here we get to hear Debussy and Zemlinsky. Enrique Martinez Miura has written the music notes. Translated into English by Marc Owen. Recommended. 4/5."
3,Skip the Intro,"The Upanishads are beautiful, timeless, and powerful. This translation seems to do them justice, and I have nothing critical to say about that. The included verses have been thoughtfully chosen and are truly classic treasures.The introduction, however, is a complete waste of time. I really wanted to read and enjoy this book from cover to cover, but simply could not finish the introduction. It is 45 pages (a third of the entire book) of self-indulgent rambling with no apparent direction. There are many apt quotes included here from several interesting sources, but they feel disconnected and random. I can't say what the author's intention was, but if there was any point to be made here, it is made far better by the Upanishads, themselves.The lingering introduction only distracts from the sublime beauty of the Upanishads. Skip it and you have a book worthy of four stars, one star deducted simply due to the relatively small sampling of Upanishads offered."
3,Textbook,I had to have the book for a class I was taking. We really didn't even use it all that much.
2,Boring,"This chick lit type book, unfortunately, did not do a thing for me. This is the second Jane Moore book I have purchased and did not manage to finish.This book was so boring that I only read until page 70 or so. I cannot recommend."
2,Stilted and boring...,"Just finished Emily Griffin's Something Borrowed then picked this one up right after...What a difference! Love at First Site is extremely boring right off the bat and the writing style is so painfully unnatural I couldn't make it past the first 40 pages. Griffin's debut, by comparison, is one of the best chick lit novels out there--very engaging with strong characters and lots of romantic suspense. Even if you like British chick lit authors as I do, don't bother with this one by Jane Moore."
4,Great book,"This is a great, quick read. Nice story, but the subplot with the main character's sister was a bit unexpected, esp. in this type of light-hearted novel.Overall I enjoyed this book and I will read Jane Moore again!"
2,"Clear, yet Strangely Incoherent","David Cohen does an excellent job in the individual chapters explaining this or that component of precalculus. But the book as a whole is strangely incoherent. The order of the chapters seems almost random, as the book jumps from topic to disconnected topic. For example, we are given a clear account of how to work matrices...and then are never told or shown WHY we bothered learning it in the first place--we're hustled off to another unrelated topic. So-called theorists in our fad-ridden education departments call this technique ""spiraling,"" a tactic designed to keep the little kiddies on their toes and off balance and thus more receptive to exploring new things. Or something like that. In actual practice, however, as well as according to common sense, the result of ""spiraling"" is only frustration and confusion. If Cohen would rearrange the order of the chapters and provide some connective tissue, this would probably make it a really good textbook."
2,"Incoherent is the word, all right","I'm an honors math major who had to use this text for a high-school AP math class a few years ago.The first reviewer has hit the nail on the head. A reader could be forgiven for thinking Cohen suffered from ADHD. He's fine at explaining the small picture, but utterly hopeless at fitting all the little bits into any kind of coherent framework. This book is all over the place, bouncing here and there, seemingly at mere whim. It doesn't really matter WHY it's so disorganized--whether the result of some ed-school fad or a publisher's marketing strategy. In the end, it's still disorganized.If your professor takes the trouble to rearrange the order of the chapters and provides plenty of supplemental material, this book might be marginally useful. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it as the primary text for a precalc course. Michael Sullivan's textbook is better organized, if not quite so lucid in its particulars."
3,OK book,"This book is written to a very understandable degree. If you are finding it difficult to understand then the problem is not the book its you. While some of the chapters may be better organized the book is not a total loss. After all you do only have to look in the appendix to find the topic you want to study about. All information is in this book including a 2 chapter review of basic algebra.While I don't love the book, I am having no problem with it."
5,great book,"Great book for the price. It's a very cheap book, I used it for two of my classes. The shipping was fast,the book was a written on but that's ok. This price is a very small fraction of the price in my school bookstore,"
2,"Good chapters, poor layout","I see that other reviewers have beaten me to the punch. I, too, found the individual chapters very good and the overall organization confused. Like a previous reviewer, I think Cohen's Precalculus would best serve as a supplement to Michael Sullivan's more effectively organized book."
1,I wish I had known,"When I purchased this product, I didn't know that I would have to attach it to a garden hose and add water. I didn't want that kind of spray. Also, I was led to believe that it was safe for birds, lizards, etc. and just repelled mosquitoes. It kills everything in sight. I find many of the bugs on my property very useful and don't want to kill them - the ladybugs that eat aphids, the dragonflies that eat mosquitoes, etc. Then the birds and lizards eat the poisoned bugs and I'm not sure what the consequences of that are, but they couldn't be good. I don't fault Amazon for this. I fault the Bonide company for not being more informative in their advertising of this product."
4,Helpful source for travelers.,"This cassette, phrase book, and dictionary are a great source for surviving in a Spanish speaking country. The book is set up so that you may look up phrases by topic with maps, travel tips, and shopping guides. It contains all the emergency phrases one would need while traveling. I was a little disapointed in the tape though. There are many voices at different pitches and I thought they spoke much too fast for someone just learning Spanish. I know some of the language and was able to decipher words, but my husband who knows none had a great deal of trouble understanding anything. One would need to be looking at the printout book of the tape constantly while listening to it. Then there was this very loud high pitched sound between subjects that I found very annoying. I would recommend it to travelers who need to know the basics, but it, by no means, will teach you the Spanish language."
3,Not for continuous operation...,"The Luxeon LED is surely of outstanding quality. Unfortunately, the Maglite-compatible packaging, when installed in a 3 D-cell Maglite, appears to provide insufficient heat-sink functionality to keep the LED and supporting electronic component(s) operating at their proper temperature.While the initial brightness of the LED, when installed in a 3 D-cell Maglite, may be as advertised, the brightness drops to a small fraction of the initial brightness after only a few minutes of operation. I have verified with appropriate laboratory equipment that this problem is not associated with a drop in battery voltage.Bottom line - a great unit if your need is to run it for a minute or so between cooldown cycles; not so good for continuous operation."
5,One of a kind,"As far as I've discovered, this is one of the few books dedicated to mushrooms of Hawaii. Great photography. And Dr. Hemmes was kind enough to autograph it. :-)"
3,All reviewers are crazy,"This is for all the critics in this item (music failers)Is not the best recording of this concert. Is true. But saying ""Markov intonation is horrible"", you might be really insane, and have not any knowlege about music. Suppose Markov intonation is horrible (is not true, is good), WHAT ABOUT YOU????? Do you think you are better??????? Markov have more success in music that you have, how it is possible????????The reason is: Markov is a professional musician,very good violinist, not brillant but correct, and you are just a big mouth.Markov intonation is very good and his vibrato too. All this critics that say ""is horrible"" can't play a noteMARKOV a talented professional musician, who win money playing the violin VS. A group of big mouth failers.YOU CHOOSE"
2,Words in upheaval,I have been trying to read this book and I am only 36 pages into it. It is very hard to read. I There was no wrap up or conclusion just statement of facts information.
5,Much more interesting than 'Worlds in Collision'.,"The second most famous book by Immanuel Velikovsky, 'Earth in Upheaval', is much more interesting than 'Worlds in Collision'. One of the main reasons why is because Velikovsky does not focus too much on Biblical stories and ancient stories from ancient cultures. That's what killed 'Worlds'; although the ancient stories were a little interesting, they were boring for the most part. I also doubt if the history was accurate too. I doubt if all the events described all happened at the same time.Here Velikovsky is a little more scientific, but his science if very flawed. I doubt most scientists would take him seriously. Recommended reading for those who are interested in alternative archeology."
3,"Cute, but stretches out easily.","Bought this for my cocker spaniel to wear after she got ""puppy-cut"" groomed. She seemed cold even with all of the fur, so I thought she might need a little extra warmth after the cut and it is adorable. I leave it on her all day long, so, after about a day of wear, it starts to stretch out and becomes very loose--especially around the neck. (This is even without using the leg straps!). It says to air dry or dry on low, but I am thinking about drying it on normal and tempt the shrinkage."
2,Imagination,"With TV and all of the other distractions, it's more of a challenge to keep your kids imagination alive. This book is precious and encourages imagination."
4,Really good receiver,"My only complaint with this receiver is it doesn't have an optical DVD input. It does have optical inputs, but not for DVD. I don't understand this, as most of Sony's DVD players have an optical digital out.That said, I was still able to hook it up through Video 1. The sound is excellent. Man, I love surround sound!The receiver was upgraded from the previous STR DE945. The 997 is much easier to use, in my opinion. The remote control has been improved 500%."
2,Not satisfied,"Bought for my three year old godson to eat and do homework. Although manufacturer's recommended age is 24 months to 6 years, this was a bit small for him."
3,the chairs kept slipping away,"unless i hold down the chair or have it up against something, it's impossible for my 2.3 yr old to sit on it by herself because the chair keep slipping away, it may help if it's on carpet or if there's anti-slip rubber on the legs, but she's using the table for drawings n stuff,"
5,Great table and chairs for a toddler,This is the perfect size table for my 2yr old and she loves it. It doesn't take up too much room and the chairs are the perfect height. Great buy!
5,Terrific Tykes Table and Chairs,I bought this for a 2-year old. It was way beyond my expectations for stability and safety. It is the perfect size but should accommodate the child for about 2 years. Colors are attractive and the table is spacious enough for 2 children to play at.
3,Sharon,"I purchased this set for my 21 month old and was disappointed in the chairs. The table is great; however, the chairs are very light weight and easy to tip over. When my son trys to sit in the chair, the chair moves out from under him. The seat of the chair is too high for him to get into and the chair back is too low. The back hits my son mid back. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this set."
2,durable but too light,"My mom got this table and chairs for our 22 month old for Christmas. She likes having a table and chairs and likes dragging the chairs all over the house. However, the table and chairs are very light weight and easily knock over which worries me when I see her climbing and standing on them. I wish I had gotten her a wooden table and chairs."
3,Sturdy but too light,The table and chairs are easy to clean and sturdy but the chairs are very light and can fall over easily.
5,Good Read for All,"The stories in this book, inspire and motivate. And that's all it takes sometimes is a little inspiration to get the ball rolling. Just to know the difficulties that some of your favorite celebrities or role models went through and how they opened the door gives you hope for your own sitiuations. Sometimes things are not what they seem, and that door that you are refusing to open, could be the door that has your opportunity behind it. Good read for teens as well as adults."
3,Dog Lover,"Made-well. The rope is really thick and it makes it difficult for it to ""slip"" the way is should. Overall, it's ok but I might would go with a less thick rope."
5,Love the ease and length,I needed a slip on for quick walk out but short to keep my dog close to me and this was perfect! Fit my small puppy to my mid size Japanese spitz. I got the shortest length by the way.
5,great training tool,i purchased the 4foot length leash to work with a stray dog that i took it.it was great for leash training and he quickly learned appropriate walking behavior thanks to the self inflicted discomfort he causes when pulling excessively.the leash was strong and durable to outlast his chewing habits.
4,Works wonders,I never knew about differed leashes. Then I was told about this one in particular by my dog whisperer. This particular leash is too thick for walking my bulldogges but it is great for around the house training. For walking I use the thinner British slip leads. Try them out - you will be amazed!
5,The Christ Story,This book can change your life. It has the potential to wake you up from the sleepwalking that is mainstream Christianity. Read with an open mind and heart.
3,"Mr. Zinn, meet Glenn Beck, Mr. O'Reilly and, of course, Mr. Rove...","Never, in all the days of my soon-to-be 64 years have I ever read an author who has all the answers to the degree that Mr. Zinn does.And, as with all who think they have ""all the answers,"" he is often wrong, but never in doubt. His writing is ""over the top"" in many ways, but that doesn't mean the man doesn't have some views and perspectives worth considering.It's his arrogance and the way he so totally dismisses other opinions--not his positions and arguments--that make him so offensive.This guy makes Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, even Karl Rove, look like choir boys and altos at that.It is interesting, even intriguing, to note that Mr. Zinn and the Glenn Becks of the world are both calling for a return to the Constitution but from entirely different perspectives and for entirely different reasons.The United States--a helluva country. And the constitution--one helluva document."
3,Spanish,Some of this information is already in another one of the books I have for Spanish teaching.
5,works every time,"We use this when nothing else seemed to do the trick....and lilke to keep it on hand, when we used the granules the chickens would get into them and posion themself. so thisgel works alot better for us!"
3,I want a refund........,"This book is not about a journey of the soul. Its about a sister who ""chooses"" to live among the white community and then be angry when she is not accepted. Its about a sister who views her opportunity to stand and be counted as a black woman as ""sacrifice"". Its about a woman who wants to have her cake and eat it too. There is no substitute for accepting who we are. Its a lesson we learn as children. If we miss it, then we learn it as adults. But we do learn it. This ""journey"" is ongoing for this author. What she offers in this book, albeit her reality, is text that clearly cries out for a good psychiatrist. I really wish she had finished the journey before writing a book like this one. Just as a note, I have long been a fan of Toi's poetry. Thats one of the reasons this was such a disappointment."
2,Unsure of the books's purpose.,"I read a lot of books both for knowledge and entertainment. This book brought me neither of the two. The author invites the readers into the depth of what is clearly her battle to come to grips with her near-white skin. We were also way-to-close to her mental turmoil. Actually, I would have liked for her journal to have at least been edited before being published. The book seemed to be simply a loose collection of ramblings about a woman being black in America. Not very well written. I did not feel as though I got my money's worth."
3,This is not the best book,"I had to buy this book for class and I really, really don't like it. It is confusing in the way that it is organized. The professer for my 102 class hated it as well. He said that it left out a lot of critical information and confuses the reader. I agree. I find I learn a lot better with a couple vocabulary books and a grammar book."
4,"A wonderful, quirky history of upstate New York.","This is a great little volume that captures the diverse, quirky and often wierd history of upstate NY, replete with scoundrels, saints and sinners brought to life with wry wit. If you grew up there, or still live there, it will make you take another look around and appreciate the odd but marvelous outcome when ""rugged individualism"" meets gentlemen farmer and frontier intellegensia. A great read. If you like it check out ""The Loomis Gang,"" another upstate history."

3,its ok,"The Game is ok. I'd give it a three.pros: graphics are awsome and very detailed. when you run out of ammo or fuel, or your aircraft is damaged, you can land at the base or carrier and reload, refuel, and fix your Aircraft. flight controls are good. the game also has a free flight mode.cons: mission are extremely difficuly. its almost impossible to evade a missle. one hit and your gone. music horrible. sometimes your missles wont even lock onto an enemy.overall the game is just like Aero Elite Combat Academy for Ps2, for those of you familiar. it isnt similar to the ace combat series, but then again its a different type of flight sim. its only worth buying if your heavly into flight sims and if you have much patience for being shot down all the time."
2,A Buggy Top Gun,"I want to like this game. The actual game play is enjoyable and would place the game in the company of games like Tom Clancy's HAWX. There is a certain Top Gun feeling to the game that would make it an enjoyable entry into airplane game genre. However, the game is kind of buggy. The achievements are standard: beat a level, get an achievement. Unfortunately, getting the achievement seems to freeze the game/system and requires restarting the system and frustratingly replaying the level (the achievement will be saved, but the finished level will not be, so the NEXT time you beat you beat the level, you can proceed without issue). So I played a few levels, and would like to play more, but until they patch this game there are other airplane games that don't offer the headache."
3,Feel like spending 20 minutes to get to your target?,"Its a decent game if you like flight simulators. Don't expect to have 50 missiles (unless its in Rookie Mode), Missions become repetitiveness and last between 15-20 minutes in average. The campaign is lengthy, and the challenge mode may be boring if you are not used to flying for 20 minutes before finding a target to hit. Overall its a good game, for those who have patience and like to play flight simulator games like IL-2 and Falcon 4.0. Imagine those games but for the Xbox 360 console."
3,Great online with an entertaining scenario,"This game is great if you reset all of your controlls to actual settings of either ace combat or what ever your preference is, it actually is really enjoyable. I am an aircraft mechanic and this is very close for what the aircraft really look like right down to the way the contrails are created while making hard banking turns. it is the best online when you make up your own games within the game with others... i have personnally played such games and continue playing for hours and hours. i actually practice landings routinely and learn the physics of each aircraft. the only thing i feel that this game could add is maybe some large aircraft IE cargo planes (for maybe an airdrop mission)."
2,A major let down,"Can't even compare to Ace Combat 6, a far more detailed game. Reminds me of alot of old nintendo flight games. Definately a major let down."
2,"Bad game, dissapointed, traded for Ace Combat 6 now very happy!","This game is horrendous, get Ace Combat 6 instead for the same price and you will be a happy camper."
2,Hmm...,"Not as fun as I originally thought it would be . Glad I didnt buy it . I love jet games which I mostly play on my PC. I rented this for my 360 and Im glad I did before I bought it . Some may like it, some may not, its not a bad game just not fitting what Im use to on PC."
1,"SUCK *SS GAME, DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This game as far as aircraft looks pretty decent and especially on the aircraft carrier on the catapult launch, the pilot has that slight bounce in the seat. But other than that this game is awful on some mission no matter how you try to evade enemy missile you are the one ejection from your plane.And the mission breifings are the cheesiest thing I have ever seen. All it is a face in a military uniform with a very bland voiceover. As for the graphics the closer you get to the ground the scenery gets uglier. Whereas on Ace Combat 6 it is very detailed and sharp. Whatever you do please avoid this awful game, if you want to buy it anyways the best time is now, because at gamestop this awful game is only $5.99. I wouldnt even pay that to be honest. If I could rate this no stars I would have."
1,POINTLESS,"Over g fighters i thought was going to be this great game, i was wrong. the graphics are not that good, compaired to H.A.W.X. & H.A.W.X 2.its kind of pointless i think, if your like me wanting to play call of duty black ops alot, then you will probubly agree with me that it is pointless.if you still want to play it i would suggest rent it first then make your decision then."
2,"Shipping, Duty and Declaration",I like the idea of this roaster. They are so hard to find! It looks poorly crafted and probably won't stand up to more than two or three fires. I figured for 25 bucks it would be fun to use it anyway on Christmas morning and ordered it. I am already regretting it because I had to add an additional 12 dollars for shipping and then another 22.00 for DHL. All costs in I have spent more than 55 dollars on this thing. Its really not worth that much to me. Ordering online has its glaring disadvantages! Wish I wouldn't have bought it. Canadians beware - this will cost you much more than the purchase price.
3,Fireplace popcorn popper,An item that is really hard to find. Hope to be able to use it when camping season open up.
1,A Hot Mess!!,I had to throw this away - i bought it to try in my fire place. I used it once and all the black coating came off!!! The popcorn was even covered in it. I just threw it out
1,Enamel coated popcorn!,"We used it three times and had to throw it out. The first time the enamel flaked off of the outside, which didn't look pretty but didn't seem to be a real problem. We gently wiped the inside of the roaster to clean rather than scrub to preserve the enamel and it seemed to be working, but by the third time I used it we were finding flakes of enamel on the popcorn."
1,Fell apart the first use,Bought this for my friend in VT who used it once and the bolts on the handle came out. Everything fell in the fire.
1,Courtney Crumrin and the Night Things,"The only ""good thing"" was Courtney on the front cover. We have been creating books, graphic novels, and paintings for over two decades and more. The way Courtney was dawn on the cover, she looked neat. The rest, however, was extremely disappointing"
4,+++,Ted Naifehs work always keeps my intrest. This series is no exception. Its not quite as drastic as his other work but a cute book regardless.
4,Enjoyed the graphics and story,"Courtney Crumrin and her parents are moving in with Uncle Aloysius who lives in a big creepy house. Her parents are trying to get in with the wealthy crowd and Courtney is having trouble adjusting and making friends at the new school. She has trouble sleeping at night and goes snooping in Uncle A's study where she finds books about different night creatures. She ends up getting herself in several binds throughout the book.This was a really creepy story but I quite enjoyed it and read through it in one sitting. I don't think I've ever read a graphic novel before and I really liked the drawings as they added so much to the story. I liked the character of Courtney as she had to deal with real life problems such as adjusting to a new school and feeling alone. I may be reading some of the others in this series as this was a nice break from my typical reading.I received this free from the publisher, Oni Press, through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
5,LOVE it!,"Just opened it & put it together...we had a little trouble with part of the assembly, and some instructions would have been nice. BUT, the finished product was well worth a little frustration! It's adorable!! It's the perfect size (I got the smaller frame as I'm 5'3""), it's fun, and I love it. We also ordered a PT Cruiser Men's bike for my fiance... MUCH more impressed with this Cadillac model! The general construction & materials are higher quality... somehow it just feels better.(And a little basket for the front was the perfect compliment!)Enjoy!!"
5,A rare find - buy one!,"Bought this for my 13yo daughter for Xmas 2008. Arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition, not a scratch. Assembly was a breeze, only basic tools needed. Although, I've assembled a lot of bikes in my life - - so I had an advantage over some folks. Perhaps the most comfortable bike I've ever ridden. Very light. I warned my daughter that were it not for the pink color, her dad would be stealing the bike from her. My wife ""borrows"" the bike often when the two of us take a leisurely ride around town."
2,Cadillac Bike,The bike arrived with dents and paint chips in the fenders and I had a bolt snap off with minimal torque while attaching the fenders.
1,One star is too much,"Please don't waste any money on this film. The idea of the film is wonderful but it never delivers. Between the bad acting and the deviations from scripture you hardly recognize the story at all. The writer seems more interested in furthering his anti-Semitic cause then exploring race issues. If you don't know anything about history, scripture or not really interested in either then you might get something out of it, otherwise skip it. My only regret in that this movie bombed is that people may think that no one is interested in seeing biblical characters being portrayed as people of color when the truth is the movie is just bad."
1,I pray for a better and more in depth attempt,"I am a black man in America. I saw ""The Passion"" by Mel Gibson. In the same respect I saw this movie by Jean-Claude LaMarre. I respected Jean-Claude ever since I first saw him playing a role in Malcom X. Yet, after this film I cannot help but feel saddened by his efforts. After all these years, is Jesus' death for the sins of mankind to be cheapened by the result of racial discrimination? The movie did not give an accurate portrayal of the events that led to the death of Jesus Christ. If anyone argues this point, I beg them to go read a Holy Bible."
1,Blasphemous at best,"The idea of Jesus being black is no more absurd than Jesus being a blue eyed blond. That is not the point. According to the New Testament Jesus of Nazareth was tried and convicted of blasphemy. He claimed to be God which really ticked off the religious leaders of the day. This film throws out that idea entirely and has Jesus being a victim of racial bigotry. The film also reports that the only reason that Jesus was born in a manger is because black folks were not welcomed at the Inn. It dosen't stop there. Jesus is crucified but is not raised from the dead. Just one more misunderstood black man who ain't coming back. This movie will likely appeal to those who are more interested in Tupac than Jesus. The film is the product of modern American political correctness rather than a depiction of Jerusalem 2000 years ago. The only way this could have been made worse if they had subtitled this ""Jesus--the Original Gangsta""."
2,Black But Not Proud Of This Movie,"This movie is to focused on race. The one movie we get to see a black man depicted as jesus and it has to be the worst person I had ever seen to portray him. I am Glad this movie went unnoticed. Maybe a good production, starring a black man as Jesus, can be made."
1,Complete and utter mess,"Its not the idea that Jesus was a man of color, there are clear indications that he might have been. Its the ridiculous notions and ""creative liberty"" that is taken with the scripture. I am so upset and hurt by this sinful depiction of Jesus, his disciples and the events leading up to his death.Sure, if he was black I truly believe that the crucifixion had something to do with him being black, but the reality is that there is no scriptural proof that Judas raped Mary or that Mary was ""in love"" with Jesus or that Jesus was a man of worry, fear or indifference.It is these types of destructive ""interpretations"" that lead people astray. I am also disgusted that Bishop Jakes was so money motivated that he would allow his movie to be a preview on something that so obviously nullifies scripture for self interpretation and profit."
1,Whack,"I am a african american woman I'm all for A black christ but come on now this movie was totally whack and the guy they chose to play christ was a horrible choice, he could not act. Jim cavisel was christ in the passion but he could accually act, he made you believe it this guy was a insult to christ."
1,So many misconceptions . . .,"Yes, there was racism played out in Jesus' death. But because he was Jewish and the Greeks and Romans hated the Jews, especially one who claimed to be the King of Kings. The Greek and Roman kings declared that they were God and were worshiped by their subjects. If not, they would be killed. Well, here comes Jesus, not only Jewish, but claiming to sit on a throne higher than theirs. So Jesus was indeed a threat. That's why they killed him. Because bottom line, he called for everyone, kings included, to worship the one true God. Jesus WAS dark skinned, but because he was Jewish. He could have been purple for all I care. But it is important to understand that Jesus said he is for ALL people. We don't have to mess with biblical facts in order to believe in his love and redemption for ALL people. Just accept him as he is, don't go trying to change the truth in order to make him more palatable or stylish."
4,Brokeback Soundtrack,"Lots more music then I remembered from the film, but the title song, the one that made you cry in the theatre is Really short. And there are many reprises of it. If you just want that haunting instrumental, you might want to look for the single track or mp3."
5,excellent fit,i was struck by the original music for sure but really captivated by the Jackie Greene track and the Rufus/Teddy Thompson track....definitely deserving wider recognition. It will be very interesting to see how this film plays in Peoria...excellent soundtrack album
4,A perfect reminder for all the emotions from the film,"If you've seen this movie and were left with that melancholy sadness from it, this soundtrack is the perfect thing to bring all that lonely longing back for you once you've left the theater."
5,goes well with the movie,"Even though as widely reported the actual movie score by Gustavo Santaolalla is only 13 minuets long, it still sets the mood of the movie and when repeated on the soundtrack brings back the emotions. We enjoyed the story and then the movie. Now the soundtrack compliments and adds to the total experience."
5,Brokeback Mountain,The product is what I expected. It arrived on time and in the condition advertised.
5,"""It's just tearjerking listening to the original score and songs!""","Brokeback Mountain is certainly on my top 10 movies of the year, and it's soundtrack is a must-have for me. I was so taken by the original scores by Gustavo Santaolalla. I mean it's his music that made the love scenes between Jack and Ennis more emoitionally powerful. This soundtrack also feature ten various Country Western singers including my favorite Steve Earle whom I loved so much since I heard him sang Pilgrim in You Can Count On Me, but his song The Devil's Right Hand here is not as catchy or touching as Willie Nelson's He Was A Friend of Mine. I also enjoyed listening to Mary McBride's No One's Gonna Love You Like Me. So if you loved the film, and can't wait to get a copy of the DVD later this year, then this soundtrack will satisfy you in terms of getting the flashbacks of the film going."
4,nice soundtrack,"I like this soundtrack alot. Some of the songs you barely hear in the movie, but nice on the CD. I have listened to it many times, and don't tire of it."
4,Good Collection,"This is a nice collection of music which will please fans of instrumental film scores as well as fans of country and alt-country music. Nothing earth-shatteringly unique here, but easy on the ears."
4,pretty good,"I noticed a lot of the composed music was played over and over again on each track. Which annoyed me. But overall, the soundtrack was nice. Some of the vocal songs seemed weird, seeing that ""it seems so easy"" doesnt seem to fit in this movie. But the other country-type music seemed to fit well with this movie. I have yet to see this movie, though. Maybe it'll sound better once I see it. ^_^"
4,Wish there was more!,"Enjoy this soundtrack; really love the acoustic guitar tracks. However, wish there were more of them. Not as long as I thought it would be."
5,Profound,I am so impressed with the music on this soundtrack. It has quickly become my favorite album. It is on heavy rotation in my car. The music selection makes me want to search for more Steve Earle and Linda Ronstant. I love the lay out of the songs. I especially love Emmylou Harris' A Love That Will Never Grow Old.
5,Fantastic Score and Original Music,"Wow, wish they would have recorded more, the soundtrack is moving, romantic and lively. I love the original instrumentals and the songs written for the soundtrack of this awesome movie. I listen to it everyday on my way to work, if I am down it raises my spirits, if I am too hyper, it'll mellow my mood. It has just the right mix of country and blugrass and instrumental melody. I Rate this score an easy 5 Stars!"
5,Best Film of the Year now has Best Soundtrack of the Year,"This is a beautiful soundtrack on every level, and accompanying the brilliant ""Brokeback Mountain"" makes it all the more heartbreaking and real to hear. I had the chance of seeing an advance screening and listening to the composer's music has left me the power i felt from the film. Simply the best score of 2005 (although Jarhead's was good) and deserves to win Best Score Oscar. The film deserves to win BEST PICTURE, BEST ACTOR (HEATH LEDGER), BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR (JAKE GYLLENHAAL), BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS (MICHELLE WILLIAMS), BEST DIRECTOR (ANG LEE), BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY (LARRY MCMURTRY) AND NOW BEST SCORE!"
5,Great Soundtrack,"I had read a completely unfair review.Mr. Clive is too pretentious on his review for this CD. Obviously people who like Andrea Bocelli(!) - and I bet he loves Celine Dion also (good grief!!! Pure sound garbage!!!) doesn't like Music. Yes! Music! M U S I C!Musical background (?!) sure he don't have none. He's on the bottom line of musical taste. The sound that Gustavo Santaolalla create for Brokeback Mountain (or to '21 Grams', 'The Motorcycle Diaries' and 'North Country' and his remarkable CD 'Ronroco' on the exquisite label Nonesuch - wich means very GOOD MUSIC) is absolutely fantastic. Very well written and fits completely the mood of the films(s)."
3,Homophobic,"When a book or film becomes a 'best seller' it will have a variety of messages for different audiences.The plot follows the consequences of one male cowboy being seduced by another.Superficially Brokeback Mountain says that even in the last vestiges of maleness, there are homosexuals.Brokeback Mountain also says that homosexuality is destructive and that homosexuals are a-moral seducers without any concern for the effects of their seduction on their victims or those who love them and their dependants.There is no evidence that is more true of homosexuality or homosexuals than it is of heterosexuals. Seen that way Brokeback Mountain is homophobic."
2,Great CD,"Good soundtrack CD for what will probably go down in history as one of the most overrated, overhyped movies of all time..."
3,"Lust, sex, betrayal and greed....","This was my first Harold Robbins novel. The story line was very interesting and really pulls you rapidly along. This is a reprint from the 1954 novel, with all the then censored scenes returned to the story, as the author originally intended to present the story. You will see why many of these were deleted from the novel in 1954! This is a wild ride of a story, filled with lust,sex,trust, betrayal and greed in many forms, and the attempt to see which of these drives people the strongest. One man's lust leads to a major collision with his family on one end and a business enemy on the other. A death is the only way out, yet no one sees this coming. This combination of ingredients is apparently classic ""sexy"" writing by Harold Robbins."
2,Don't bother.,"Brad Rowan is happily married and runs a successful business. Suddenly, he falls in love with beautiful young widow Elaine, and enrages steel tycoon Matt Brady by refusing his job offer. Brady (who happens to be Elaine's uncle), for some reason, sets out to destroy Brad's business.The story is quite uninteresting and the characters are shallow, their motivations unclear. The translated version I read was obviously censored because it didn't include the graphic sex scenes that other reviewers refer to, but I doubt those missing sections would do make the book much more interesting. It's a quick read but uninteresting. Don't bother to search this one out."
4,Fascinating and Enlightening...No Need To Spice Up This Tale,"The author takes a little known (to laymen) period and place of history and provides an enthralling survey of the spice trade and mercantile rivalries between the Dutch and English.That merchantmen of a few centuries ago were willing to risk probable death, or at least years of privation in pursuit of modest wealth is amazing. The number of deaths, amount of suffering and frequency of atrocities not only underscores the costs of exploration and trade but provides an indelible backdrop to a fascinating story.The author tells this tale well. Although many characters arrive and quickly depart the tale (owing no doubt to the scarcity of complete records of lives and events four centuries ago), the story is vivid and compelling. Enjoyable and very readible."
5,When life exceeds imagination,"Reading some of the reviews, one might get the wrong idea that this is a ""fun"" history book. Well it isn't. It is a fun book period. It has all the elements of a great adventure book filled with intrigue, danger and bravery with the distinct novelty of realizing as you go along that it is all real. Everything in this book is based on journals, diaries and documents of that era and the author weaves an incredible tapestry from those many resources turning them into a single coherent and, I find, fascinating story. The historic tidbits that accompany the storyline are, in my opinion more of an added value then the main course itself and should be treated accordingly. Think of it as a historically accurate ""treasure island"" that teaches you a thing or two while you're enjoying a great read."
2,Eh. Another Armchair Imperialist,"I was, sadly, less than entirely impressed by this work. It was too scholarly to make good historical fiction, and not scholarly enough to make good history (I was never a big fan of end-notes, though that's just a minor quibble).I was just unable to bring myself to care about the fates of the Imperial organizations involved in conquering this tiny patch of island, far away from anything. I was impressed by Milton's evaluations of how the island of Run became so important, but less so by his focus on the European side of the story. Given the legacy European colonizers have left in Indonesia, Milton's unapologetic pro-Britishness rings falsely.I was underwhelmed, and unabsorbed."
4,Interesting History,"This is an enjoyable book to read, easy to get into and hard to put down. I found the story of the Spice Trade to be quite interesting and that I suppose was a result of the hard work put in by the author. The story was fun, vibrant and quiet blood-thirsty and all over a little 'nut'. This is good fun history and the story is well told. Well done to the author!"
5,Excellent History,"Giles does a wonderful historical job in telling a complicated story, but not getting in the way of the history by invoking his views as most historians do.This book should honestly be one of the required reading books as it literally sets the entire stage from Columbus to the birth of the American nation. It explains the almost mad dash the European powers made in making the most brutal of wars on natives and on each other that carried on to the American Revolution.It is a very easy read which is a page turner that pleases one in teaching you without lecturing.The only thing which puzzled me is his choice of title in Nathaniel as while he was a brave and a fine officer he is not a major part of the book. That though is Giles choice and the book deserves 5 stars."
4,NAthaniels Nutmag,I enjoy this type of background history about individuals and unknown facts about how people find a wat to solve problems as was explained in this book.
1,It Put Me to Sleep,"since this was a required summer reading book, i simply assumed that it would be a somewhat dull read, but Nathaniel's Nutmeg exceeded those expectations....i found it very difficult even to finish....plus, nathaniel himself was only in the book for a couple of pages and then he dies...blah, blah, blah...i would strongly recommend against reading this book!"
4,historical novel,A well written historical account which is like reading a novel.Gives insight into the trade routes to Southeast Asia by European ships in the 1500's.
5,Nathanials Nutmeg,I enjoyed this book a lot. I have given it as gifts and purchased a second one when someone kept my original copy. The spice trade opened many doors for the British and the skirmishes between the Dutch and the British make a whole lot more sense.
2,No Secrets!,"The thin paperback book, ""Car Accidents Secrets"" provides general common sense instruction on how to handle a personal injury case by yourself. I found no illuminating secrets in this book and the information it does offer is easily accessible on a number of free web sites, ie. Pain and suffering calculator. I suggest the writer provide more real life detail, and offer examples how to negotiate your claim with an adjuster. An adjuster will state there is no magic P&S calculator. I would expect the author to anticipate this and advise the claimant how best to reply. Overall, the book offers a good general guide on how to settle a claim. Save yourself $30 by clicking on a few internet lawyer based sites for the same general guidance offered in this book."
4,"Great book, Really helped me","I got in an accident, someone hit me and caused about 800$ of damage to my car. The car was towed to a garage and I needed a loaner. I wish I had bought the book before I got hit. I made 2 mistakes with the garage and the loaner car, if I had read the book it would have saved me even more money. Thank goodness I found the book on the internet after the accident. I used the book, the forms and the secret formula to get a great settlement from the ""other"" drivers insurance cmpany. Before I read the book I thought my insurance company and me would have to pay for the damages I received. The book also includes a chart that shows based on an accident who pays for what. It also tells you how to talk to the other insurance company. Without the book I would have never received the amount I did."
3,Still need a lawyer,"this book was helpful with its diary, fact sheets and walk thru of what record keeping is involved."
4,This book was huge help in settling my car accident,"After one year of healing from my car accident, I finally settled with the other drivers insurance company on my own. I followed the book step by step, everything is listed in order for you to follow. I did;t have to go against my insurance policy, the book showed me that and many more hints which helped save me thousands of dollars from hiring a lawyer.I was also very pleased at how easy it was to read and follow along with the author given several examples of real accidents and how they were handled. There are things in this book you should do immediately even if a lawwyer is needed. The book has a chart to tell you and when it makes sense.There are more than one secret that everyone as a driver should know from the book that would help you in case you do have an accident. As someone who has used the book to settle, I can tell you I am very pleased for the price."
4,Excellent reference,Great reference book for anyone who has been involved in a car accident.Tells you what to do after an accident and has many tips.
3,Good book,I needed a book to help me after a wreck I had with another driver and this book showed me how to collect my claim from the other drivers insurence company with very little effort from me. The other driver was totally at fault and it was nice to be able to do it on my own and get the money fast - I recomend this book
2,Eh...,"You'll notice half the reviews are from people who mindlessly love him (""He is beyond godlike"") to those who are too easily offended (""written by a ... colossal waste of life""). Kind of hard to get a clear review of a book when two so polar emotions are driving the rating.The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Some of the stories are entertaining (whether true or embellished) but they can quickly get tiresome. Certainly not for everyone, but good for a half-chuckle or because we all know someone who behaves very similar to the author. Like a loud drunk in a bar it can be entertaining for a few minutes but certainly gets old after a while."
1,The necessity to denounce...,"I'll waste as little time of the reader as possible here:Max is a poor writer, with the worst possible approach to his subject matter.Self-declarations of granduer ought to warn any reader to abstain from supporting the work.It's not that lechery is a poor topic, it's that the topic is infantile in the hands of a mediocre writer, and thus I recommend readers to give it no consideration."
2,only worn once,"Although the necklace was advertised as wood with metal accents,the ""metal"" accents are so cheaply made that it's more appropriate for a child's dress-up game. And the wood is poorly sanded and cracked in places. It certainly doesn't look polished. I did wear it out once, but I probably won't again."
2,For buy good but.......,"It is cheapgood presantation,many option, but when you start to assamble most of the parts impossible to cement."
4,Great;,"For kiddies and adults alike (just read the entire series). In a grand adventure the carpet people must be saved. It's in Pratchett's usual cheerfull, commical and enthralling style of writing.Enjoy ;)"
3,Not one of the best Terry Pratchett books,"While I enjoyed this book, I liked Pratchetts Bromeliad (diggers/truckers/wings) trilogy far more. This book has good characterisations, and I don't have any quibbles with the plot, but throughout the story I kept thinking: ""OK, they all live in a carpet. Um, is this an abandoned house, or will there be vaccuuming?"" Likewise, there is a huge penny in the carpet that has been there for years - will someone pick up this penny? I considered that perhaps miniature people had shorter years, but they experience regular length days. These little problems made it hard for me to really get into the storytelling."
5,"My dog just loves, loves, loves Merrick food!","And I like that the senior medley has a lower calorie count. I have a senior dog who also suffered from skin allergies a few years back until I changed over to grain-free. I also have to keep my dog's weight in check and have been feeding my dog grain-free products for several years. Changing over from common dog food, non grain-free food, was simple; my dog loves the taste. But finding enough variety in the local stores at a good price is not so easy. I like that I can purchase this on-line at a great price through the Amazon site. Even happier with subscribe and save option--I just set my delivery options and don't have to worry about running around town with an empty dog bowl!!!"
2,Mio Sport,"This is a nice watch/monitor unless you are moving, i.e. running. I have never been able to aquire a heart rate while I am actively running - even after following the guidleines in the instructions. I do like the fact that you don't need a chest strap and can take your heart rate throughout the day to monitor stress and active levels."
2,Too much for too little,"It may look somewhat okay but if you're buying it for using the pulse functions, don't bother. Within a month, the battery was dead. I replaced the battery and now it is completely incapable of taking an accurate pulse. Now the pulse comes back as over 200. I loosen a screw just a bit on the back and then it tells me my pulse is in the 40s. As for the rest of the watch, it is standard and sufficient except you have to push a button every time you want the date because it is not on the main display."
2,Broken on Receipt,"Not a great way to make friends and influence people, but the light function on watch did not work upon receipt. In additon, the digital readout looks like it is from the first original digital watches manufactured in the 60s. Small numberal and even smaller letters! The design is kind of strange and should have had more emphasis on function instead of form and had a larger display! Heart rate monitor is irregular if not used exactly as described in the manual. I do not recommend this watch!"
2,"It worked for a while, at least. . .","When I bought this, I really liked it--it worked quite well for a few months. But then, I would try to take my heart rate, and it just wouldn't do it. Like another reviewer noted, I first couldn't take my pule while moving. Then, it stopped doing heart rate readouts altogether. If I did get a readout, it would be very off. For example, after doing an intense cardio workout, it said my heart rate was 55. Impossible, with how hard I was gasping for air! Other times, right before I even started a workout, it would say I had a heart rate of 220. I guess if you buy cheap, you get cheap stuff. Next time I will definitely buy one with a chest strap, such as ones made by Polar. This was a totally unreliable product--one I started out liking, but now want to smash into pieces because it won't do what it is designed to do! I gave it two stars instead of one because it at least worked properly for a little while."
5,I love Fred!,"If you like the photo on the cover, you're going to LOVE what's inside. Fred is just beautiful, and Roffman captures him in various moods, settings, and stages of undress. Great for a coffee table in an adult household."
4,Elegant Pump,I bought this pump in brown for my wedding. It matches perfectly with my brown and lilac dress. But it does runs small. I'm a true size 9 but ordered a size 9.5. And even the 9.5 fit a little snug on my feet at first but loosened up within 1/2 hour of having them on. They could be worn with jeans and a nice top as well.
5,Beautiful CD,I had been looking for this CD for years. I finally found this CD on Amazon.com. I love it.
1,Lonnie's early albums are better.,"Although just about any album from the master Lonnie Liston Smith is a must have, this album has too many ""filler"" type songs on it. Quiet Moments of course is the center piece of this album...but is not the original version. This version is a reworked piece which added too much of a jungle feel to this great smooth track. If you are looking for Quiet Moments(original), pick up Lonnie's latest ""greatest hits"" cd called Explorations: The Columbia Recordings. This CD will satisfy your need for Lonnie at his best!"
4,Great steak knives,Henckel knifes without exception are always good product. I like the fact that they have metal handels instead of wood which lose their finish over time due to cleaning. The knives cut through meat with little effort and are a good value for the money.
4,Pretty Good,"This is the latest thing from Sweden. I know that they are popular with the ladies. Even the band Jet are fans. They combine punk rock and a familiarity with Britpop. ""Cut The Rope"" is reminiscent of The Libertines. There is a mod vibe on ""God Knows."" ""Clean Town"" is much like early English punk rock music. They worked on this album with Richard Rainey, who worked with U2 recently. Besides The Concretes, there are not many new exciting bands coming from Sweden. Mando Diao may be a band to check out live, I get the feeling. ""You Can't Steal My Love"" sounds like a remake of ""Don't Look Back At The Sun"" by The Libertines. Hopefully the chorus goes into a different direction. I wonder why they are compared to The Libertines so much. Mando Diao is a band capable of great things on their own. They are due for a great album soon."
4,highly recommended!,Great album from a great Swedish rock group! Very catchy tunes and great vocals. It's definitely worth buying!
2,Not what it seems,"I'm sorry to strike a discordant note here, but I was disappointed with this album. True, Sylvia McNair sings beautifully as always, but the New Age backing by Daniel Kobialka is not to my taste. And there is far more Kobialka than McNair! On several tracks she contributes only a touch of vocalise to the synthetic 'orchestral' texture, and on one track she is absent altogether. Kobialka's music is repetitive, and one track sounds very much like another. Music to make love by, perhaps - I have been unable so far to test its effectiveness for this purpose - but not music to listen to. Lovers of Sylvia McNair's wonderful albums with Andre Previn should make sure that they like this sort of thing before buying."
3,Fiddler and vocals,"Claude doesn't make it easy for me here: I usually don't like vocals between my instrumentals and here he fits in five! His own are adorable though and blend in with the fiddling just fine.As for the ladies, I love Karrin Allyson, have all her records, never heard of the fine voiced Lisa Henry, but would like to meet them somewhere else, they distract me from Claude's wonderful fiddling.And wonderful it is; strong, ever swinging, attacking the melody, just wonderful. So you see the kind of bind I'm in..........My favorite track would be For All We Know, where 88-year old Claude seems to surpass even himself!"
4,the king of kansas city jazz?,"jay mcshann probably deserves that title more. however, this isa fine album by the (recently deceased ""fid,"" as he signedautographs). no weak tracks; and the vocals by karrin allysonand lisa henry are, as claude himself told me, ""tops."""
4,A cordless cobo pack even I like,"Most cordless keyboard/mouse combos have one problem I really dislike, light text on a black keyboard which can be hard to read as light reflects easily. This keyboard/mouse combo with its dark gray lettering on a off-white surface is easy to read no matter what the light conditions. It is comfortable and has great enhanced feature by a good reputable manufacturer, Logitech."
3,"Good story, but.......","I enjoyed the film except the acting was a bit off. The points where the actors should of been scared, they were making dumb odd ball coments, which made me laugh rather than take the story seriously.The ending I did not get. I have read lovecraft's ending and I enjoyed it. This film would of gotten 4 stars if it had stayed more adjacent with the original lovecraftian story.Other than that, forget about the actors and focus on just the story and you will love it. A fine film for hangin out with friends or a girl on a friday or saturday night when there is nothing to do."
2,Gag,"Ugh. Well, here's one for the crap-pile. A perfect example of ""what not to do to an H.P. Lovecraft take"" (in other words, ruin it). I read a review on a different site and it boasted the ""awesome sound track"". good lord, it was worse than the movie!!!! I could picture the guy in torn, acid washed jeans, up for days on tweak, shaking his sweet curly mullet and forking the devil sign while moshing around his living room, thinking this movie (and yes, the sound track, too) was the best thing since bathtub crank.Sorry folks, bypass this one, unless you are a die-hard Lovecraft fan and on a mission to see all available (like me). Your time would be better spent, watching one of the other screenplay versions of The Lurking Fear (Lurking Fear and Bleeders a.k.a. Hemoglobin).And yet, I gave it two stars....which I did because there's worse HPL films out there...lurking...sucking"
1,Torn in three different points,"The band already came a little torn when I got it, but it was very little and I kept using it. After 1 month (using it carefully) it snapped and I fixed it with an elastic band. Two weeks later it torn in two other different points. Very disappointed."
1,Chineese copy of the real thing,"I was replacing a red band from my physical therapist that finally died. This red band is thinner, weaker and obviously an inferior product. It even has an odor. I do not expect it to last as it has frayed with one use. Really disappointed."
3,green loop band,the band is smaller than thought. the 18 inch band would be better and easier to loop around the ankle.
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting something that was a log bigger and not such a thin material. I would not purchase these again.
3,Not quite for me,"The watch had a number of nice features, but I wasn't able to set the time for Phoenix, so I returned it. Phoenix was not one of the cities on the list."
1,sucks,This is the second time I order one of these and once again it breaks. It works good but its a wast of mobey something more sturdy needs to be made
4,Great for training,"I once thought that these things are gimmicky, but I have recently enrolled in a circuit training class and found that there are plenty of strengthening exercises to be had with these bands. Resistance training does not have to involve heavy weights; bands are great for working deep connective muscles.I travel a lot so these are great for being on the move and a great complement to hotel gyms."
1,Not even close...,"I bought one of each size band; Blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. I was quite disappointed when the blue band tore after 3 days of use, followed by the yellow one the very next day. Then, two days ago, the green one ripped. I now only have the red and orange ones in tact.I want to make it clear that I was not abusing these bands. I was using them in a fashion commensurate with how they should be utilized, and I was not slip knotting them or anything like that. While tearing the band does not render it completely useless (as it can simply be gripped differently), I was nevertheless irritated with the shoddy quality of the bands.Band training is something I think is a good supplement to a well rounded training routine, and I definitely subscribe to their use. In the future however, I will cough up the money for additional Jump-Stretch brand bands, and avoid cheapies like those reviewed here."
2,Too short for the money!,"I blame myself for ordering this very poor and short product. I missed the words ""12"" relaxed"". I do resistance band exercise at my senior center, twice a week, we use gray stretch bands, they are ugly looking,and are supplied by the city parks dept. I was drawn to the great colors of these bands, but this band is too short to do anything. If this band was sold for half the price it would still not be a value, I almost ordered all of them, because it said free shipping, and I am a sucker for free shipping."
3,came with a hole in it,WHen I had received the yellow band in the mail it had a very small pin hole in the band. I used it anyway for about 6 months and loved the resistance it gave. Unfortunately the hole continued to get bigger and one day snapped. I will buy another just because I liked the product but hopefully will last a little longer...
3,"Nice quality band, but loop is too large to be effective for my knee strengthening PT exercises","Nice quality band (green: medium/heavy resistance), but 13"" loop (13"" laying flat) is too large to be effective for my knee strengthening physical therapy exercises, rendering it nearly useless. I barely get to its stretching point. I have a small frame (5' 3""). Using the loop on my ankles, feet hip width apart I barely reach the loop's stretching point."
5,Love it,Great resisitance and good quality! I was a little wary buying these...but they turned out to be great! I use them for my bum bum videos and they are better than the ones that came with it. (That band broke within a month!) Highly recommend this!
3,Good Quality,"The quality of the product is excellent. The seller was prompt in the delivery of the items; I could not be more satified and would probably order more items. also, I recommended the product/s to my friends and family. Good job."
4,"Stinky and a little cheap, but do the job for the price","I ordered three of these. The rubber is extremely stinky. When I was pulling the package out of my mail box, I thought I received a dead animal. They don't smell like rubber, they smell putrid. I had to wash them a few times and soak them in alcohol.The rubber is rather cheap, the seams are very visible; so they are not very durable. I am a short, thin female though, so I am not worried about them busting on me. If you are bigger, you might consider a different product.I am also a little hesitant about putting these bands against my skin, so I don't exercise in shorts, only long gym pants. The rubber just looks like it might cause a reaction."
4,Exercise bands,"The Balego exercise bands are as advertised. The price is good for the product, and the product works well for the price."
5,"exercise fitness loop - resistance band, blue, heavy",This exercise band works great. I just recently finished physical therapy and wanted to continue some of the exercises at home. I felt the price was reasonable and am happy I purchased.
5,Great band!,"I needed a replacement for the band that came with my Brazilian Butt workout and this works great. It's a little hard at first but after a few uses, it works great!"
5,Perfect,"This band is exactly what I was looking for. The perfect size and resistance. I am so happy with this product. The shipping was really fast, and I was grateful for that because I needed it right away. Great buy!"
1,Too small,I purchased this band to replace and old one I had that broke. The new band is about 1/2 the length of my old one so it's not really working for the exercises I purchased it for. I don't think they come in sizes so not sure how to prevent this in the future or how to get one the size that I want.
1,I was fooled,I didn't realize that after the reel the bottom of the pole was only about 2 inches. There is no place to hold on if you ever get a decent. You couldn't tell this from the picture. When I got it home I said where is the rest of the rod?
5,Biblical vision and values for our children,"ENOUGH of this ""passive parenting"" many adults hold so dear to their hearts! This book holds strong and solid advice for parents to be a formative part of their child's life by exercising love, understanding, and discipline. It is an incredible book and an easy two-day read. Isaiah 54:13 conveys the ultimate goal and message of this book, ""All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children"". It reaffirmed for me biblical values for raising my child to please the Lord by preserving the delicate spirit within. You will absolutely fall in love with this book and begin your search for the next Dr. Dobson book...as I am!"
5,"Exceptional Guide to Raising Healthy, Confident Children","Realizing children do not come equipped with instructions, I was searching for some guidance on how to give my children the confidence to become all that God intented them to be. I did not babysit as a child and was a very young mother when I had my first child. Dr. Dobson's book help me tremendously confirm the things I was doing well in raising my children and the things I could improve on. Many of the techniques were so helpful. I highly recommend this book as the best baby shower gift or gift period to any expecting parent(s)."
5,A Lyrical Dialectic from the Master of Discipline,"James Dobson, fundamentalist qua child psychologist, has done it again with this wonderful textually self-referential dialectic on child ""rearing.""Dobson, who's earlier work has inspired us to spank our children, really hits the mark with his proverbial cat o' nine-tails here. Gone is the winsome, friendly Dobson- replaced by a ruthless Dobson seeking to enhance ""self-esteem"" through the either/or of ""hide and seek.""Skillfully blending a poetic sense of kinder-angst with the ethic of the ubermensch, Dobson clearly establishes a nexus of wunderkind endlossung, with a result that is sure to elicit more than a few belly laughs."
5,A great new vendor,"I bought the book for my son because my mother bought it for me as a child, I loved it then my son loves it now. Great artwork, nice short stories to go with the images, stimulates the imagination. The vendor had the book to me 48 hours after purchase and they said it was, ""like new,"" and that's exactly how it arrived. I will purchase out of print books from them in the future without hesitation! Thanks so much."
2,"Insightful In Places, but Mostly Muddled Thinking","Disjointed collection of policy ideas for strengthening community. Contradicts herself far too often (as where she calls for greater commuinity control over what and how social services are provided, but then later says the Federal Government must control the process since state and local governments can't be trusted to provide specific services).Another glaring flaw is her tendency to cite marginal writings by fringe academics in support of her proposals. Most of those proposals, by the way, call for a massive new infusion of taxpayer money.The first two chapters are a very good concise analysis of current social service provision. After that the book peters out in a mish-mash of muddled thinking."
5,I'll Meet You On The Mountian,"I love, love, love this dvd. The music and the scenery are breath taking. I would high recommed it to any gospel music lover."
1,I Wish I Could Go Lower,"I bought this on the off chance I would ever see another Mac disk (it's been years). Given the business I'm in (publishing) there's always a chance a client may for some reason want a Mac. I did the install, but it wouldn't activate, saying the server could not be reached. Given that I had installed Dragon before it and the latest Acrobat after it, the problem wasn't on my end. This went on -- punctuated by uninstalls and reinstalls -- for several days, until I finally called the manufacturer, who gave me an activation code. Guess what? It STILL wouldn't activate! Even yet another uninstall and install did no good. I can only assume this software is so sloppily written that the disk it comes on is good for only three things: as a coaster, frisbee or clay pigeon. It should be zero stars, for what good is a program that won't install?"
5,Love it,"I'm using MacDrive 7, and I used MacDrive 6 as well. It does exactly what it promises. It lets you work with Mac-formatted drives on Windows machines, and those drives function just as they would on a Mac. You can even format them in HFS/HFS+ if you'd like. Highly recommended for those in a mixed computing environment."
2,"Dri-power doesn't work, at all.","While the socks fit fine and are otherwise comfortable, they do NOT keep your feet dry. My feet become and stay more sweaty in these socks than in my previous Champion basic crew socks. I'm currently at work with my shoes off to try and keep my feet dried out.In short, ""dri-power"" does not work."
3,The best socks but would like to find extended size,"I bought this product socks over last 5 years and all suddently my husband complained about it something not the same and he would like the socks bigger size or thicker.., I found them in costco and cheaper."
4,Dri-power seems good as coolmax.,"I needed to replace some coolmax socks which were wearing thin, but did not want to pay $8 or more a pair. These seem to be every bit as good as the coolmax ones, with a bit extra cushioning to boot."
2,Quality Downgrade,"Have been using this product for over 15 years. I was shocked and disappointed with my recent purchase. The fabric quality is not the same. It is like buying used socks -- wash worn. And, every sock is now marked with a blue ""R"" on top of the toe. Wearing them without shoes covering the letter marking gets the same question. ""Couldn't you afford a left sock."" Tried bleaching out the ""R"", but no luck. I'm looking for a different brand. Or, maybe I will find the NEW/LEFT sock."
2,Not the same quality as the old formula!!! Beware!,"I purchased 5 packs of these because the composition of 88%acrylic 11%nylon and 1%lycra spandex was the formula of the Russell 12pr packs sold at Costco for so many years. Having recently purchased a pack from Costco (which by the way cost around $14. for the same socks), I discovered that the formula had changed to 86%acrylic 11%nylon and 3%other fibers-the socks were bigger, thinner and nowhere near the quality of the old formula...Anyway, when my order from Amazon arrived, imagine my dismay when they turned out to be the same new, poor quality socks as currently sold by Costco. I am waiting to return them...If I wanted more of these not so great socks, I'd buy them at Costco for half the price!"
2,CAUTION - Not Like the 2008 Version,"These are NOT THE SAME QUALITY AS IN 2008! I purchased 24 pairs of these socks in 2008. They were very soft, thick, strong, extremely comfortable & very long lasting. Made being on your feet all day a lot easier to take. I recently purchased another 24 pair and there is NO comparison. The portion above your ankles is reasonably thick & soft. The important part below the ankle is rough & thin. I'm going to keep them because they are still better than other athletic socks but I sure am disappointed. Russell added their logo but ruined the quality IMHO. Figures!"
2,Phone number for Russell Athletic socks questions,"I too am very disappointed with the change made in the composition of these socks. I'll be looking for a new sock to wear. I've worn these for about 15 years and the new socks (with the ""R"" on the toe) suck in comparison.If you wish to contact the manufacturer, here's the number:(800)334-9091Candice was the person who you can speak to about the new formulation of the socks."
4,self help book for alg/trig/log/calc I. (applied science),"This book is written for someone who has been exposed to the subject but did not understand it, or has not had a math class in a while. Ms. Olive has taken extra effort to help the students avoid the pitfalls often encountered in these math topics. This attitude is reflected throughout the book. I felt that with the numerous problems solved at the back of the book (in detail), the price of this book,was a frugal investment. With vectors and additional physical science problems added to this book, I would give it 5 stars."
2,Verbose and generally not helpful.,"I am a mathematics teacher, at the secondary, community college, and college (undergrad and graduate) level. This book does not address the basic needs of the struggling student, namely: what is mathematics for? Further, the book is verbose so that even the successful student will get bogged down in the sheer magnitude of the book."
3,Artwork is all wrong,"At the time of writing the artwork shown for this album is that for an Andrei Petrov album of classical favorites - this has nothing to do with the album described which is of a live concert from Germany of the russian jazz group ""Moscow Art Trio""."
1,Lies - and deliberate lies at that,Will the Christians ever stop inventing fear and lies about other religions? This book is nothing but! Read it only if you want to learn about predjudice.
5,very recommendable book,"One of the most interesting classical texts. If you are interested in Greek myth, legend, history and culture, you must read this series !"
4,A Description,"It's been three years since former police sergeant Steve Hansen was framed by his corrupt boss, Chief Dale Shipp, for the murder of his wife and stepdaughter. Now escaped from prison, he's hell-bent on revenge. But when he shows up in the chief's office in Bayport, Texas, the man on the other side of his loaded gun turns out to be Shipp's successor, Mark Shigata. Hansen is even more surprised when Shigata and Captain Al Quinn believe in his innocence and offer to help clear his name. But they'll have to move fast, for another body has just turned up, leaving Hansen once again with a motive and a weapon... but no alibi."
4,Don't leave home without it!,"Just returned from the Czech & Slovak Republics and found this book invaluable. Excellent, correct descriptions of localities. Useful to those of us who drove the country and trained too. The mini phrase section is all you need, so don't buy a separate phrasebook. Those going to Prague should also buy the DK travel guide for that city which is excellent and colorful."
3,Lonely Planet Guides Print Sizes Are Too Small,"I have used LPGs for years, and many travelers like myself are older people. Lately the LPGs font size has gotten very small and really hard to read, probably to save money.Make the fonts readable for older people, even if the product becomes larger and a little more costly. This applies to all recent LPGs I have bought. Guides are not helpful if you have to struggle to read them. This is particularly true with maps. Last month I gave my daughter in her 40s a guide for Ireland, and her first comment was ""I can hardly read it"". However, your content, as usual, is exceptional."
4,Great for the student traveler,"This will be my first time traveling to the Czech Republic, and I know that my university will be taking me around to other countries. This guide is perfect for finding the historical hot spots in eastern europe. Wish the guide had more pictures for reference."
3,It means well.,"In an interesting twist onBorn Yesterdaya mob-type enforcer befriends a down-on-his-luck writer to help him and learn from him. There are definitely quite a few plot twists that kept things moving, but the direction was sadly lacking. I am a fan of William Petersen so I truly wanted to be engaged in this movie, to enjoy it, but it was just flat and two-dimensional. The acting was actually quite good and came through in spite of the poor directing, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie to the next level."
3,Wincott steals show ; Aspect Ratio Warning,"Wincott was great in Alien Resurrection, but had to be killed off early so Sigourney Weaver could be the strong lead. He rocks in Gunshy, while Peterson is terrible and Lane has virtually nothing to work with in this poorly written script. There are huge, gaping holes in the plot, which was apparently written for TV -- or should have been. This is a movie that survived bad dialog on the basis of reasonably good direction, quite good photography & editing, and excellent acting by the key character, Wincott. In the end, he was the only one you cared about. The DVD was cheaply made using the VHS master, thus it is merely 4:3, not widescreen, a major disappointment."
4,William Petersen,"An OK movie, William Petersen carries it. He's an incredible actor, as we all know and too die for handsome & sexy- loved where he was throwing back the straght shots of boos- very realistic- kinda of a weird ending- Diane Lane & him had OK chemistry-don't know the other actor, never have seen , or heard of him before or since- just glad I can see WP on CSI- wished he'd make a killer Oscar winning movie"
4,Opinion,"I love William Petersen, in anything he does, but he's played in some really crappy movies, & he's so good, this is OK, Liked where he was downing the straight shots, of boos very realistic- he's so incredible to look at that you kinda of forget how lousy the movie is. Diane Lane is as always good & beautiful, the chemistry between her & WP was pretty good, lucky girl, to be in bed with him. I liked the last line he spoke in his jail cell, very profound & prolific. Have never seen before or since the other guy, don't have much of an opinion of him!!!"
4,Guns can be scary as well as shy....,"This is a movie about being shy of guns and is comical in a way so if you want a good laugh and enjoy watching sandra bulluck or diane lane, then rent it. You probably will enjoy the dark nature of this movie with enough laughter to keep it enjoyable."
3,Nice design but too small,"My son loves the picture of batman and the joker on the box, but it is really small. Doesn't store all that much if you were looking to use it for a lot of toys. Good if you don't have much room. I expected something bigger. So now we need to purchase a second toy box of the same size so we have good storage capacity."
2,expected more,"I knew it was small when I ordered it but I expected all the pieces to be in the box. Bought it three months before early and didn't find that the bottom panel was missing until opened. Fortunately, that panel was easy to replace with 1/4 inch plywood. Thank goodness the sides and top were included!"
1,this book sucks,"This book has some funny stuff, but i only made it to page 70 something. I am not the husband who is more into drinking beer and watching sports than spending time with my family. This book is good for husbands who like to do the following1.stare at other women2.watch porn3.just want to make her think you are into her, instead of being genuine4.more concerned with sports than your wifeI was expecting something funny yet not slimy, well i was wrong. i got a little funny and pretty slimy. o well, the book just went in the trash. I ordered another book too which is genuine.One of the little chapters was "" how to pretend to not look at other women"" .... really?"
4,The Gag Gift That Isn't,"It looks like one of those books you'd find in Urban Outfitters in the gag gift section: You know, the type that is interesting for about 2 minutes. But it lasts beyond that and really does have some interesting tips. I left it around the house and pick it up to read a chapter every once in a while. It's funny, clever, and educational."
2,Too small,My son needed this for school. My son is 8 years old and the wig was a little too small. He wore it anyway and it was good enough for what he needed it for. I gave two stars because of size. The wig was fine otherwise.
3,Used?,"This item is being sold as NEW but when I opened it there was a chunk of what I think is dried up mud in the wig and the collar is dirty. The bottom of the package can easily be pealed open and then closed again so I'm thinking it was used and then returned. Other than the used condition, the wig fits our 9 year old just fine."
1,"Junk, don't waste your time/money","Junk, spend another few dollars for better wig.....frilly scarf was not frilly at all. Even for a 10 min class project, this wasn't good enough quality.jen"
5,Excellent In Every Respect!,"Alligator Love Cry is a terrific album which infuses new life into the blues, jazz, soul, and beyond. Great singing from the incomparable Mike Mattison and heartfelt, emotional songs throughout. A must for all, especially roots music devotees."
2,"Alligater Love Cry, by Scrapomatic",I have seen this band in concert and absolutly love their blend of the blues. Alligater Love cry is a disapointment. Never really goes anywhere. I will continue to catch them live whenever they come to town.
1,Buy NAME BRAND!,"I usually buy things with a name brand for a reason, and purchasing this item reminded me why. We had been needing an extra camera battery for a while and decided (before a long vacation) that this would be a good one. It does have a car charger adapter. We received the package and got it all charged up and ready to go. Within 2 weeks (while on our long vacation), the battery pretty much died. It wouldn't last more than a hand full of shots and we had to keep the display turned off to get those. The charger also would not charge our Sony battery. Then one night after charging, I put the battery in the camera, and the camera gave me an error when it turned on, then turned itself back off. It wouldn't work after that. The name brand items are more expensive, but you get what you pay for."
4,Good leather - elegant look,"This bag looks pretty, nice red colour, has good quality leather. I like it a lot in terms of looks and utilities. The only disadvantage is that it is a little heavy already when empty, so if the laptop and cables are in it, it becomes heave."
5,All the cds by this band rock.,The Guys in Orange 9mm are friends with KORN and The Deftones. When you get these guys together who can tell what will happen. If you like KORN or the Deftones BUY at least one of Orange 9MMs albums. You will not be disapointed!!!
5,A Pinch of This Dash of That,"I own several Gooseberry Patch books and this is one of my favorites. From Grandmas Kitchen is my favorite but this one is next in line. If you only buy 1 or 2 of these cookbooks, these are the ones to have."
5,"A Pinch of This, A Dash of That",Can't wait to use some of these recipes. I have always loved the Gooseberry Patch collection but couldn't afford it before and it was in perfect condition.
2,Too Bad They Released This CD,"As a long-time fan of BTO, I wanted this CD to give me a dimension that the studio sound couldn't give. Unfortunately, it did. Although the performance was exciting, as one would expect, the quality of production did not do justice to BTO - or to me. If the scores could be qualified, I'd say 5 stars for BTO, zero for the folks who remastered."
3,no title,"Slim volume published in early 50s that is a treatise against war, and a lot of propaganda-type writing for the United Nations. Book starts with early history of war, which evolved from apes, and gives short synopses of major periods until World War II. Galt is really a peace-nik. And this book is aimed at pushing UN objectives and making its goals more understandable to young people. Read it because of black and white pen illustrations by Erik Blevgard who did (does?) the Woman's Day magazine biblical calendar every year. His drawings are very good, I think. And I learned a few things about early war and the U.N. Book filled with numbers and stats about the latter. Interesting to see what high hopes they had for it, and here we are, fifty years and some wars later, and what has changed? Nothing. I don't think peace is in the human psyche."
5,Obvious Results!,"I have always been a big fan of the K&N brand, but after installing this fantastic air intake kit on my Viper I can feel a noticeable difference in my Viper's performance. I highly recommend this product as it is easy to install and it looks fantastic!"
4,Dvd burner,I've had no problems with the lite on drive. It was easy to install. It burns fast but I haven't been able to find blank dvds that are 20x so I can't say if it'll burn that fast.
1,WARNING! NOT LITE SCRIBE,"After what I thought was careful comparison between the various models, I selected what I thought was the LITEON model with LIGHT SCRIBE labeling.Either myself or Amazon made the mistake- not sure- (only $2 difference and very similar model numbers). Either way, I wound up without the LIGHT SCRIBE feature.I want to stress that there are reviews under THIS MODEL that talk about LIGHT SCRIBE. This model DOES NOT include that feature. Be very careful if you want that feature to get the model that includes it- and read your conformation email carefully!"
4,so far it's been a great product,"The drive works great and its pretty quick , I was also pleased that its not loud I couldn't even hear it running. Set up was easy.I gave it four stars because I haven't used it long."
4,Lite-on Right-on,"LiteOn is one of the fastest ATAPI / E-IDE DVD Writer in the world The LH-20A1P will automatically detect and decide the optimal write strategy of DVD recordable media (DVD+R & DVD-R) for the best write quality.

1,Disappointment,"Drive was returned. Did not perform as stated. Took many times longer to create a CD than my old drive. I gave this info with the returned item. It may have been defective or just overly agressive advertising. It was not a 20x, but more like a 2 x."
3,Great for burning - not so much for extensive DVD viewing,I have had this product for a couple of months. It burns cd's and DVD's just fine and is relatively quiet. Please note this is not the lightscribe model and it is ide not sata. I have issues with the length of time this drive will play DVD's. After a few hours I start getting read errors from the DVD. If I let the drive rest for a while or use my other burner everything is fine. So while I can recommend this drive for burning I cannot recommend it for extended DVD viewing.
1,P. U. What a stinker!,"This is a rotten movie. It is a rip off of some old, tired western and a kung fu movie. It has bad acting, bad fight scenes, and no story. If I had the flexibility, I'd kick my own butt for buying this dog."
5,the very best gary daniels,"one of many movies i own of gary daniels and still one of the best he never had the chance to break in to a rated movies, it would make a lot of people stand up and take notice of of this man is capable of. he is only a few action stars in the uk. still the most good looking star ive seen. the movie is great all in one package. not your average gary daniels i must say. but it a side of gary i like to see, not just martial arts. its nice to know that he was born about 15 mins from where i was born, which i feel very humble to say. give credit where due and the credit is long overdue."
1,Mediocre...,"I was very much disappointed with this movie. The plot of the movie at the beginning seems to be interesting. But that doesn't last long. Everything starts to fall down after the widow and her brother-in-law gets acquainted with each other. The ending is another absurdity that needs to be highlighted but due to the review policy restrictions, I'm holding that one out.The fighting scenes are o.k. One note on the fighting scenes though: the director of this movie should have paid more attention to the details as the ropes hanging behind the stuntmen can be clearly seen.Even if you have 10 dollars to spare, don't waste it on this movie."
5,DANIELS DELIVERS,"Gary Daniels with his British accent will never be honored as one of the world's greatest actors, but his films deliver, and in that sense, this is one of his best. Daniels plays a bounty hunter in a world drastically changed after a comet collides!!! Bryan Genessee is the villain, who also happens to be an old childhood buddy, but of course he has gone the wrong way and his vile gang wants to control the gasoline in this apocalyptic society. Daniels gets to play two roles: the aforementioned bounty hunter and his twin brother, who just happens to have the gene that can come up with an antidote for some vile plague that has surfaced. When he is mercilessly slaughtered by Gennessee, lovely wife Barbara Crampton (Reanimator) is on the run and soon joins her brother-in-law.Nothing new or unpredictable here, but Crampton is always fun to watch and Daniels is a good martial arts hero. I had fun with it!"
2,Wow what can I say,Well I've never seen the lead actor before and I will probablypass on any future movies of his. He is nice to look at even the bad guy was easy on the eyes. But I would rate this movie a C- (or 2 stars) it is a low budget and came across as such.
3,Blackfoot - 'King Biscuit Flower Hour' (King Biscuit Entertainment),"Recorded live at the Palladium in Hollywood on August 10, 1983. Main reason I bought this CD here recently is because I saw guitarist Rick Medlocke with Lynyrd Skynyrd a few summers ago. Maybe not the best King Biscuit release out there, but still decent. Tunes here I got the most out of were ""Rattlesnake Rock 'N Roller"", their two hits ""Train Train"" and ""Highway Song"", Uriah Heep's ""Easy Living"", ""Fly Away"" (great guitar work) as well as ""Living In The City"". Has an interview where Medlocke discusses subjects like touring with Nugent and the Scorpions, playing large European festivals with AC/DC and Iron Maiden and how well Blackfoot had functioned as a band. Line-up: Rick Medlocke: slide guitar & vocals, Charlie Hargrett-guitar, Ken Hensley (forgot all about how he was with Blackfoot)-hammond organ, Greg T. Walker-bass & vocals and Jackson Spires-drums & backing vocals. Nothing too special, like I said but alright."
3,"If your a fan,buy it........","If your a Blackfoot/Rickey Medlocke fan I'd have to say it's worth owning this CD. The 20 minute interview alone will get you off,especially if you're into Southern rock lore.From a sound & performance standpoint however, you'll be a little let down. Like the other guys have said, get ""Highway song live"" to hear Blackfoot in their prime."
1,Poor quality CD from a once truly great band.,"Blackfoot is my favorite southern rock band. I had visions of a great live album matching the caliper of the several live cuts on the compliation ""Rattlesnake Rock and Roll"". Quite frankly, they should have left this one in the vault. The sound quality is terrible and the performance overall is just not their best. I wish they'd have released ""Siogo"" or ""Highway Song"" instead, that would be a treasure trove for die-hard fans."
1,SHOULD HAVE BURIED THIS ONE!,"It pains me to give a Blackfoot release a bad review but trust me ,there was no other option on this one.Blackfoot was without a doubt one of the greatest live acts I've ever seen but this recording does them no justice.The fire that Medlocke and Co.always brought to the stage is without a doubt missing here.If it's live Blackfoot at their best you're looking for,then look no further than their first live release 'Highway Song'and you won't be disappointed."
2,A young adults history of the California Gold Rush.,"Axon gives us a short history of the California Gold Rush. He details some brief history of the gold discovery in 1848, talks a little about the 48ers and more about the 49ers, and then moralizes in the last third of this very short book about discrimination, racism, and other aspects. I guess Gordon feels he has to lecture his young readers about the evils of society long gone. Well, I wanted a little more history, and not some morality lecture.In any book, I am looking to learn something. I could have learned more if the author kept on track. He did not, and that is why I rated this book low."
4,Piano Music For Christmas,"I like Christmas Carols to be played on solo instruments or just orchestral versions,This CD is enjoyable with good slections and a fine pianist."
5,Perfect balance,"Excellent CD. Not too fast or jazzy, but not so slow it puts you to sleep. Great for background music for a party or while you're decorating the tree. One of our favorite Christmas CDs."
3,Loud Motor...,"All the features listed above are true to form for this machine. However, the big disappointment is how loud the unit is! Picture living with a hair dryer on all the time... not good. Loudness aside, it does do a great job. Living in the midwest, I would opt for the 60-pint size- I am emptying the unit almost every 8 hours."
1,Poor quality and sensor didn't work,"I purchased this unit based on the good comments from other reviewers. But it turned out to be a big mistake.Sensor reading was not accurate. It showed 50% humidity while my other odometer indicated 70%. How could it be 50% humidity in the basement in August? Also, it continued to shut down after a few minutes and wouldn't go back on even I set the sensor to much lower level. Besides, it was extremely loud. It sounded like someone was using lawn mawer in the basement. I don't think anyone can stand the noise in the same room. The packaging was very poor, the bottom almost fell apart when I received it.It looks like the sensor of this unit is defective and the quality in gernal is very poor. I have returned this unit to Amazon and purchased a different brand locally. The other brand works well and is much quiter."
2,Tripping circuit breaker,"We just purchased this dehumidifier after reading the majority of positive views and were very excited to use it, but the unit keeps tripping the circuit breaker after running for about 5-10 minutes. The temp of the basement is about 70F and we put a 50% RH setting. We are using a surge protector and the unit is not sharing any other equipment on the outlet? Are we doing something wrong?"
4,Seems to do its job,"This is the only dehumidifier I've owned so I don't have anything with which to compare it. This model does it's job. I can set the desired humidity and it provides a readout of the actual humidity. It also displays the temperature. I have it in the basement with the hose draining directly into the sump pump. I've been running it constantly for 6 months with no problems. The basement is about 1300 sq. ft (although I have the door to two of the rooms closed) and is open to the upstairs through a pet door. The only complaint I have is the noise. I don't spend much time in the basement, but when the fan on the dehumidifier is running full power I can hear the motor in my bedroom just above it. The sound comes up the heating units."
2,WAY too much annoying noise!,It dehumidifies very well-NEVER freezes up in the back and has worked fine for over a year but WAY too much annoying noise for a basement living space /TV room. I have to shut it off to hear the TV.
2,impossible to keep the bucket from sliding out,"The thing that makes this dehumidifier unusable is that the collection bucket has no clip or detent of any kind to keep it in place. As soon as it slides back about 1/16"" the unit thinks the bucket is overfull and starts it's annoying and insistent beeping. No matter how hard or how many times you push the bucket back into the unit, a few minutes later it slips back a bit. This is one of the silliest and most unnecessary design flaws I have ever seen.[edit] Well, I did find a way to make the bucket stay in--most of the time--by wedging some pieces of cardboard under it. There are better machines out there."
2,Ribbon Embroidery,"This is a beautiful book how ever, this is not a book for the beginner. The steps for making silk ribbons are not complete, and not enough instructions for the amount of silk flowers that are in the book. If you don't know the terms of sewing with silk ribbon this is not the book for you. It was not the book for me. Margaret Baker"
5,excellant!,"It is very detailed, and worth the price. Many of the details can be used with other types of embroidary also."
4,Very creative,"I agree with some posts that this book is not for the very beginner who has no knowledge on craft stitching. However, for those who has a little experience, this book makes a great addition. I really like the ideas that are given in this book, and incorporated some already into a new project."
4,Charming! Diverting! Provoking!,"""The Wanderer"" is a wonderful novel detailing the struggles faced by a single woman in England in the era of the French Revolution, who due to circumstances beyond her control must remain nameless and ""family-less"" and thus rely on the charity and goodwill of strangers. Readers familar with Jane Austen's writing will recognize a similar style, indeed Fanny Burney was an inspiration to Miss Austen, yet with an even more critical eye turned towards the upper-middle-class social structure.I found it a little more plodding in parts than ""Evelina,"" my favorite of Burney's novels, as Burney occasionally gets bogged down in minutiae of social interactions, but even those long descriptions give insight into what details would have been considered monstrously important to Burney's contemporary audience.Regardless, the difficulties faced by the nameless heroine and the mystery of her circumstances are more than enough to engage any fan of 18th and early 19th century literature."
3,Their 2nd best collection.,"This is a pretty sweet disc, and it does include most of the great ""Culture Club"" and ""Boy George"" songs, but I would easily get the ""At Worst...The Best Of Boy George And Culture Club"" first. Why, because it's cheaper, it's longer, and it includes ""Victims"", ""Move Away"", ""The Crying Game"", and ""Bow Down Mister"", all of which are missing here. It's just a matter of getting more for less. But this is still good of course, just not the best."
5,Beautiful chain!,"This copper rain chain is even better then I thought it would be...beautiful, (very large!) and well made. Cant wait for some actual rain, I have no doubt it will be lovely!"
5,they look and work great.,"I added these on new gutters I had installed.Finally got a big rain here in Houston, and they work great. More splashing than with a regular enclosed downspout, but they work well, and look great. Once the rain dropped down to ""normal"", no splashing, and they make a wonderful sound when you're looking at them.The length was plenty, I even had to take the bottom tulip off my 8' overhang."
5,an eye catcher,We really love the rain chain. It has begun to patina and give it a classic look. Since it's near the front door we get a lot of positive comments and a chance to talk about it.
3,A Very Nice Scrapbook,"For Angels fans like myself, this is an excellent momento of the season. It is essentially a scrapbook of all the AP reports from the notable games in 2002. There aren't any new original accounts or renditions or behind the scenes or anything like that. It doesn't really tell the story, it reminds you of the story.I'd have to argee with the previous reviewer and say that those most likely to enjoy this book would be die-hard Angels fans. If you're a World Series buff or just someone with passing interest you probably won't be as attracted with this."
2,A Poor Effort,"Though certainly colorful, this book looks like it was thrown together by a grade school yearbook staff.There are incomplete stats, edited stories, and a complete lack of any sort of focus or narrative. It feels like someone just tossed some random articles with some random photos and thought it complete. The layout is geometric and boring.The CD is really the worst sort of waste. All that space (for interviews, or film, or stats, or sounds, or more photos, or ANYTHING) is filled by a few bad photos and more useless, bland info.On the other hand, it is about the Angels incredible run, and includes World Series Game 6, the greatest game in Angel history. Wait for a discount before buying unless you're an Angel fanatic!"
4,Good assessment concerning many aspects of these fishes,"Barrons in general, does a great job in presenting thier information in a concise and clear manner. Even beginners will have no problem following along in this 'pocket reference' publication. Do not let the price or size of the book sway you. It is packed with all of the pertenent information. Tanganikan cichlids are wonderful fishes and barrons does an excellent job of intoducing all of the husbandry techniques needed to keep these fish happy and healthy. One drawback is that more experienced aquarists or ichthyologists might find the book lacking in some of the detailed areas. Although overall, you pretty much can't go wrong when purchasing this book"
2,"Okay, but not nearly what I expected","I did order this online through amazon, but did not feel that this is what I thought it to be. The beads are huge, and honestly, I don't think I will wear it. Problem is, when it was sent, nothing was ever said ""if you are not satisfied with the purchase please call (insert number here) or send it back in this envelope...I will even pay the postage, I just don't care for it as I the image and description made me believe I would.The price was great, I thought I was getting a great deal. But when I pulled it out of the package, I saw that the beads were big and not quite as long as I expected either.Sorry."
4,Good value,Fairly good burning speed for both DVD and CD-rom. Not the best but good especially considering cost.
1,Buyers be aware,"Do you have slight (or big) problems with your drive after few uses?. Download Sony's own drive check utility program from thier support site and see for yourself (they are strongly recomend not to use it until directed to do so by useles technical support), and read chek's log files shoving drive's internal problems (software missconfiguration.....). Proudly made in China, congratulation on your purchase. This is my second drive in least than two monts and is going back, this time for refund."
2,"great until one month after warranty expired, then #%$*&#!","This drive worked beautifully for exactly 13 months. Then, my pc wouldn't recognize it. Reinstalled it, upgraded firmware, but nada. Not a good deal."
5,Excellent,Excellent service and price. Very Orden and full shipped. Excelent presentation. Good work. Its very nice item. Full services and Very type.
3,Disappointed,"I have to admit that this may be a ""good"" game for some but I was looking for a strategy game where I could play admiral and direct fleet movements, etc. In this game you have to drive boats, shoot at airplanes, fly airplanes and shoot at airplanes, and that is as far as I got before deleting it from my computer. Total waste of money for me.If you like being in the center of the action and do all the flying, driving, shooting, etc. you might enjoy it if the price is cheap enough but be aware that the graphics are VERY dated."
3,"Cool game, but a little hard","I'm new to gaming, and love the stuff on my Wii, but this game requires a more standard controller, e.g., similar to Xbox 360, etc., and I have no idea how to use it skillfully so the problem is with me, not the game. Looks like it will be more fun if I ever figure out how to play it better."
3,"A Shooter, NOT A Stratedgy Game","So you don't make the mistake I did, this game is a SHOOTER, NOT a stratedgy game. As a shooter it is fairly entertaining and the graphics and battle engines are good.What I was hoping for (and what some of the product info I read said) was that it was partly a strategy game. This it is not. I was hoping for something on par with Avalon Hill's ""Midway"" board game (only for the PC) where you can setup the war in the Pacific using the same historical units and strengths. Sort of a ""Medievel Total War"" for the Pacific theatre of WW2.I'm now going to try ""Pacific Storm"" and see how that will fare."
2,"OK, but WAY too short","Quick review. This game is OK. The gameplay is fun and you get to switch between any unit in the game, however there are a LOT of things goiong on at once and usually you end up staring at the overview map. The game is incredibly short -- I finished the campaign in about 4 hours. Then all that is left are the challenges. Worth it for $10 in a remainder rack. Not at full price."
4,for the dorm room,"I have 24 hr quiet hours in my dorm and these fit the bill nicely.On the back of each speaker is a deep hole that can provide some bass. They provide rich mid-volume sound for my tv tuner, games, and music. Would have given it 5 stars if the fm tuner were digital."
3,Decent Buy for the Price I got it for,"I got these speakers when Amazon was giving them for $9.88 so I am quite happy with it for the low price I paid.The FM radio stinks, needed a digital tuner badly but missing. The radio can properly tune to only a few stations rest are overlapped.The clock is okay but then the computer itself has a clock so its just a fancy feature.As for the speaker, its quite good looking, goes well with my black flat panel. No complains with the sound of such a basic speaker, quite good actually. One other problem with mine was the on/off switch does not work, anyway I decided not to go into the hassle of getting it exchanged, but its an annoyance and not expected from Philips.Buy it only if you get it on a deal."
2,Good for <=$10 only,It's a nice looking little speaker set with radio but the power and sound quality is not good. Also the radio (atleast in my office) doesn't work very well and I keep losing reception.
4,Good sound,"Good sound, good reception on the radio but I never pay any attention to the clock. The radio dial is a little quirky, I think, but overall, a good value."
4,Great features for the money,"I have used these for an MP3 player and a laptop.They work very well, sound good enough and I only paid $10 AR"
1,Black Oak,"This would be a good album if the recording were even fair, too bad, it's really really bad!!! Pick another album with the same songs on it, there are plenty of them out there."
3,o.k. for experienced programmers,"this is not a book for anyone not familiar with previous mastercam releases. I've been working with mastercam 9 for 3 years and this is o.k. for making the transition from 9 to 10, but it does not explain any fundamentals or how any of the functions work, only the keystrokes and mouse cliks necessary to execute them. I also have trouble understanding the refrences to the exercises on the C.D. The C.D. does not have a file for each exercise."
1,Frustrating and very poorly edited,"Did anyone actually do the problems given in the book? If they did they would have discovered that key strokes are missing and some dimensions are wrong. Awful, don't bother."
5,A must for IT managers,...A practical guide for IT managers on how to get streetwise regarding corporate politics. The author approaches corporate politics in a real world view that provides IT manager's insight on how to best mange the business corporate politics with a streetwise angle.
5,Truly Phil Ochs best,"I am a folk purest. i do not like the over produced sounds of Ochs pop albums. this is the album to buy if you love topical folk. it is direct and crisp. i count these many songs amongst the best he ever wrote. ballad of alfred packer, ballad of john henry faulk, spaceman, time was. i would name them all as excellent. must have for any phil ochs folkie fan!"
3,Interesting failure,"Interesting group of collaborators. It doesn't quite gel. Ian Hunter co-writes three tracks (and sings them), while contributing his classic song The Outsider. Essential for Hunter, Mott The Hopple or Mick Ronson fans."
4,"Not great sound quality, but that's not the point","This sounds like a bunch of friends who got together and made some demos for a few days that never got polished... I like it. It's rough around the edges, but interesting for fans."
3,A must for Mountain fans,"Altough it is not typically rock album Mountain fans will be satisfied with three members of the group playing on it. A very rare video with Felix Pappalardi is worthy every dollar you spent. The Outsider should be in every rock history collection. It was great idea to find and put those recordings on CD. Three stars for rock fans, five stars for Mountain fans."
4,Textures in Knife Painting,"This is a great book for beginners(especially painting knives), the textures it presents are used in a lot of paintings. The book has very good examples of rocks, mountains, and water all things that need to have a textural component that can be difficult to achieve with knife painting. I prefer knife painting and this book has been a great resource to me."
4,palette knife and landscapes,Although this is a small book it is packed with how-to's with a palette knife and includes color mixes
5,Great Instructional Book,"I have been wanting to learn to paint using painting knives. This book has great illustrations and detailed instructions which will, no doubt make my learning much easier. Good price, too!"
1,Trike Stinks!!!,"Dont waste your money, My wife bought this for our 3 yr old son and i put it together and it was very shakey. Not safe or secure. Dont waste your money as i said!!!!"
1,It lasted two months....,"Bought this for my nephew in May and it fell apart in June. Not very sturdy to begin with, and it has a terrible turning radius. He had to pick it up to turn around on the sidewalk. I would recommend the Harley tricycle instead. I bought that for the other nephew 3 years ago, and it's still going strong."
5,Better Batting for Baseball,"This is a fully illustrated manual of the mechanics of the baseball swing. The author has broken the swing down into parts. In simple terms and with the use of illustration, he points out some the batter's best moves. He brings to life the styles of some of the great hitters of the past. This book takes some of the mystery out of hitting a baseball. It takes some of the mystery out of hitting a baseball and can be of benefit to every player from the little leagues to the major leagues. This is a thorough and comprehensive book on the mechanics of hitting written in a well organized and easy to understand way."
4,A vision of New York,"E. B. White shares his vision of New York City, a world of contrasts. My favorite image from this short book is that he describes in the last paragraph of the book is that of an old willow tree growing in an interior garden. He says it ""symbolizes the city: life under difficulties, growth against odds, sap-rise in the midst of concrete, and the steady reaching for the sun."" As always with E. B. White, lovely writing."
5,"A glimpse of old New York, inspiring for today's readers","I've loved E.B.White's writing ever since a grade school teacher read Charlotte's Web aloud to the class, chapter by chapter. His writing is unique, clear and memorable, whether he is writing about what he sees out his window or about life in New York walking down a busy sidewalk, masses of people all around him. While life in New York has changed significantly since E.B. White first wrote the words contained in this book, readers will find his writing also timeless in spirit and inspirational in invoking a renewed appreciation for New York and the little details that make it special. White once said of his writing: 'Writing to me is not an exercise in addressing readers, it is more as though I were talking to myself while shaving'. If only we could all be as articulate, memorable and even humorous while talking to ourselves and others! A very special book, worth reading and re-reading."
5,"A Wonderful Read, A Fabulous Gift","I cannot think of a better gift than E.B. White's ""Here Is New York."" It is exceptionally well written. Penned in the late 1940s for Holiday magazine, White's description of New York City is timeless. Some of the buildings he references are gone. The passenger ships no longer arrive and depart with such regularity, but in this 7,800 word work you can find the essence of New York City in the 1940s and in 2009."
5,"Sex, races, frogmouth and ray.","A necessary collection for the ""Love and Rockets"" fan. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,Not as advertised,"The reviews I read said that White gives the reader a feel for life in New York. Nonsense - the book is vague to the point where it could have been titled, Here is London, or Here is Shanghai. If you want to get a feel for New York, or at least the Bronx where I grew up, read ""World Fair"" by Doctorow."
4,"There is also an 18"" x 18"" size","I'm hoping that Wizard Industries (the only supplier of this cloth on Amazon) will eventually sell the 18""x18"" size cloth too. This larger size allows for longer massage strokes. For now, the only place I can find the larger size is [...]."
1,"Expensive for what it does, not really useful.","It is to silly a concept to buy pre-made, does not work to well, it is to small, etc."
4,Great stories...easy read,This book contains a lot of great stories. The sequence of how and why the family stories are told are very interesting. Quick read and will leave you thinking...
5,Like a trip to the fun house,"I picked this up when I was out on my bike and stopped at a sidewalk bookseller. A warped gem caught my eye among the assorted unrelated new age fare. Planned to take it all the way home to read, but ended up in the sun, bike aside on the grass in a park, riveted. Idiots First is shiksas, sex, lies, crime, sadness, poverty, pride -- life twisted and yet too real. Italians, Jews -- one is even a bird. Think Edgar Allan Poe mixed with I.B. Singer. Step right up, idiots first!"
5,Chicago's Last Hope for A Good Time,"Worst and best live show ever. The singer was nude the whole time, the guitarist was hitting on all the young boys in the crowd, the drummer was wearing some sort of Speedo stuffed with tinfoil, and the bass player actually punched the sound man for some reason. When they were able to play a song, it was too fast to comprehend and the singer was just receivng a fist-baptismal by the crowd. ..."
5,Son's Blender,I purchased this blender for my son who is using it for smoothies on his wieghtlifting program. He said it works great especially mixing all the powdered ingredients that used to clump in his old blender. Thanks lots.
2,Ice ended it,"It is a nice blender that does a good job, but it is FRAGILE.We put one piece of ice in it that was apparently too big, and the blender died without putting up a fight. It was just under four weeks old."
2,A one use wonder,"I have seen older models last for years, but this one burned out on the second use. Whatever happened to quality control?"
3,Some glitches with this product,"The blender works well; however, it has VERY soft black rubber feet on the bottom, and I have white counter tops. It's impossible to use the blender without it leaving awful black marks on the counter top.Also, this unit came with a small food processor that leaks no matter how little liquid I put in. It sounded like a nice extra, but unless they change the design so that the top securely fits the bottom (maybe with some rubber gasket?), I believe consumers will consider the small food processor not usable."
5,Works Great,"This blender makes great smoothies, which is what I primarily use it for. The ice is chopped very fine!"
2,Tried 2 with no luck,"I had bad luck with this product. I received one, used it once and something shorted out(heard a pop and then it stopped). It was easily exchanged for another, which also did not work well. It seemed that the pitcher did not fit well on the base, thus the black plastic around the spinning mechanism, was slowly grinding away. I took it apart, put it back together slightly less tight, tried putting pressure on it while blending etc. Nothing worked so I returned that one as well."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I bought this from WalMart. I was using it to make baby food, and it burned up the FIRST time I used it. My house stinks like burning plastic. I am avoiding this brand, because I bought this one to replace my last Oster that burned up. I'm never buying this brand again!"
1,This was not a good buy,We bought this blender in May 2006 and used it once during the summer of 2006. We used it for only the 2nd time today and it burned out after the second batch of drinks. It is just past the warranty period. It may be a fluke but we will not buy another Oster blender.
5,Excellent to grind grains,"My old Cuisinart blender had a metal base to a plastic jar bottom. With this type of set-up, the plastic jar bottom eventually broke. When it broke, I purchased replacement plastic bottoms for the jar ($10 each). After it broke the second time, I decided to get a new blender and tossed the Cuisinart out. The Oster blender has a metal base and a metal jar bottom. I can't see the metal jar bottom breaking. It grinds grains without making too much noise. I grind brown rice and millets to make home-made baby cereal almost every day. I will never go back to Cuisinart.A friend gave me an old Oster blender but the jar bottom was stuck to the jar. A new jar assessory costed a little less than a new blender, so for a few dollars more I got a new blender which looks a lot nicer than the old 70ish Oster."
1,Don't waste your money!,"While this bed is adorable and the little ones love it, it is unsafe and a total disappointment. The bed was extremely hard to assemble and once it was together It was unstable. The hardware and instructions are ridiculous, the center bars do not stay in place also screws fell out. Holes did not line up and on and on, I returned the bed and went with a plain white toddler bed. Also wrote to Marvel and said they should be ashamed of themselves for letting their name and characters be used on such an unsafe piece of garbage."
5,Great work of research on the subject,This book is a remarkable work of research on the subject. The fact that it brings together writings by different historians and writers makes it particularly interesting as it presents different perspectives on the subject.
1,Biased research,"This research represents the view of Armenia on the conflict. Though it might be a good source of information for studying the Armenian position on the matter, the book itself can not be served as a source for the study of Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Instead consult with Tom de Waal ""Black garden""Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War."
2,I certainly will NOT reccomend this for anyone,"the story is, actually, very interesting, but, like others have said, it contains A LOT of 'graphic' scenes. i am appalled that it is actually a teen book. (parents, you might want to think twice before letting your son/daughter read this. Harry Potter is a much better use of time :])"
2,Not much happened in this book,"A Certain Slant of Light had so much potential. The premise and idea were amazing but I couldn't connect with the characters and there was no world building what so ever. Another problem I had was the lack of development between the characters. They jump in the sack way too fast and I didn't understand why they even loved each other. I feel that the two most important things in a story are the connection to the characters and the reader and the world building. Readers want to be enveloped by a story and be taken away into a world unlike their own, this story did neither. Also the lack of climax made the book fall flat. There was not much excitement in the book, I would not recommend it.This review is also posted on my blog, Midnight book reviews."
4,Good story,"This story pulled me in from the beginning. The story is about a girl who has been dead for 130 years, she's a ghost, and falls in love with a boy whose body has been taken over by another spirit. The author has a knack for imagining what it would be like to live as a ghost. She makes it completely believable and very compelling. I thought her portrayal of the fanatically religious family was very accurate as well. I couldn't put the book down and the ending was very touching."
3,Intersting.....but,"I got into this book and wasn't sure that I was going to make the effort to finish it--but I am not a quitter and I had to see it through to the end. I found that the writing was very unique and the language of the story was beautifully written. I am glad that I read the whole book and didn't give up, but I would not recommend this book to anyone I know especially a young adult. There is a lot of offensive language in it--over the top I think even for today's standards. The situations that the main characters find themselves in are very adult and very descriptive--almost too much for me and way too much for a young adult. I found the concept of the ""Christian"" family portrayed in this book to be unrealistic and badly stereotyped.I cried at the end of this book and was glad I gave it a chance--but read it at your own risk."
5,Great great book! Very very romantic and so much more,"Such a great book! I've never read anything like it! The longing, the yearning... One of the very best romance book and such a wonderful story about ghosts. Nothing scary. Grown-ups, don't let YA category stop you from reading this work of art."
4,"Gripping, unique story, minor warning however....","The story could have been polished a little better but I have to say I was drawn in. It was a fast, addictive read that drew on the emotions.I would not however recommend this for teenagers (thought I read somewhere that this is a ""teen"" read???) For one, totally inappropriate- for two- if you are a Christian you would want to read this yourself before passing it on to your kid. There are some questionable theological situations here and the ""Christian"" family in the story may not be portrayed in a way you would find flattering. Nothing overly offensive by any means- just maybe not appropriate for immature minds."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"I know a lot of people were freaking out about there being sex in this book. Yeah they were in teenager's bodies, but they were adults. They died in their late twenties. They're old enough to have sex. :-D I really don't know if I can honestly say I agree or disagree that this is appropriate for young adults. But I am not a parent, so I am just going to say as a 27 year old woman..this was a really good book. It has a very interesting story and it was a page turner. There were some kinda strange things happening, but that made it all the better. I think the author has a great imagination."
5,An interesting take on the afterlife,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The idea presented of this afterlife was interesting, but didn't come across as pushy in anyway. The characters were engaging and realistic, the plot moved along at a good pace, and overall it was a lovely novel. I loved Helen's character and her internal struggle and the ending was satisfying.I only hope that anyone else who reads this book doesn't believe all Christians (if any) act as Jenny's parents did.... they were really, really terrible (at least they show an example of exactly what NOT to do). You really do end up hating them..."
2,No safe sex?,"**Spoiler Alert**This book had a neat concept that was unsuccessfully followed through on. Not horrible, but nothing that will stick with you.What struck me though was what a horror story the future was going to be for the kids whose bodies the ghosts had been in. James and Helen don't even bother using condoms when having sex with the bodies they are inhabiting. Towards the end it is itimated that the body Helen is in is pregnant which she seems to think is a good thing. You've got to be kidding me. Seems to me that when ""Jenny"" regains her body and discovers she is pregnant both she and ""Billy"" are going to be in a world of confusion and hurt."
4,Interesting,"I liked this book... However, there were many things that could have been improved upon. The story was great, and in many ways, heartwarming. The first half of the book was well developed and VERY well written. The second half got kind of choppy and emphasized things that seemed unimportant to where the story was going... I loved the ending, though! Overall, I would recommend reading it."
3,I expected more,"It's easy to read (actually a bit short) but I thought it would be much better. The isn't almost any action and the characters are too plain (they aren't moving). I didn't like the way she writes, some people here say the opposite and I'm not an english native, but I read a lot and it didn't seem special.Anyway it's goog to spend an afternoon."
4,Loved it!,"I loved this book. It gave a new twist to ghosts (I had just finished Meg Cabot's Mediator series right before starting this book). I'm very superficial and do judge books by the covers and didn't think I'd like this one, but after a slightly slow beginning it got really interesting. I gave it to my sister to read and she liked it too."
2,Not as good as I thought,I was expecting this book to be a lot better than it actually was. the characters were just so frustrating to me and the way everything unfolded just annoyed me. I was really excited to read this novel when I bought it but I soon learned that it was not going to be even half as good. It took me a whole week and a half to finish it when usually a book that size would only take me at most 2 days. Don't buy this book. Instead borrow it from the library if you're really determined to read it.
4,pretty good but not great,A Certain Slant of Light is an alright book. I thought it would be much better before I read it but I was terribly disappointed at some of the things in it. The beginning was pretty boring and the author seemed like she was just trying to hurry with the book the entire time. Everything was explained very dryly and dull. It just didn't catch my attention very well. It did get pretty good when Helen took over Jenny's body though. Just Jenny's problems with her over religious family and all that jazz. The ending was pretty good too.Was this review helpful to you?Was this review helpful to you?
4,Ghost story with some new elements.,"The story that Laura Whitcomb wrote is in fact something unique. The start is awesome and it makes you want to keep reading. The ending, though, is not what I expected. The book's action scenes are smoothly portrayed during the story. The ending was quick and kind of lame, it just makes you long for more or makes you ask yourself ""Is this it? Is this the ending?""...The author seems promising, she'll probably write great books in the near future. I recommend this book for young adults (16+) or probably teenagers mature enough (14/15)."
5,Beautiful,"Wow. was all i could say after reading Miss. Whitcombs book ""A certain slant of light"" i happened to pick it up in a random stop at Barnes and Noble and it has been worth every cent. I've already recommneded it to my writting and reading group.i couldnt put it down and i was left breathless and tearful.I felt so strongly for Helen and James, their stuggle for salvation and the love of one another like nothing ive read before.you even feel for the secondary characters despite themselves. i.e.)Mitch and Cathy.Its beautifully written and we can all expect great things from Miss Whitcomb.i couldnt recomend this book more."
2,A Complex Beginning,"I am the type of person that needs to be roped into a book within the first few chapters to really enjoy, and ultimately finish it. This novel did not do it for me. The idea and initial plot of the story was very inventive and creative, which is always refreshing to stumble upon something new and original. I love seeing new ideas come to life in a novel. That was the problem though, it did not come to life. In my opinion, the author did not do a very good job formulating the opening scenes so that the reader can get a good picture started in their head. I also thought it was written too complexly. It was difficult to tell if the main character was actually experiencing the scene in the schoolhouse, or if she was paranoid and imagining the boy staring at her. I am sure the novel explained itself later on, but I just was not pulled in enough to make it that far. For all the impatient readers out there, I would not recommend A Certain Slant Of Light."
3,You arrived. Timely manner. Winner!,"Ive heard some great reviews about this book through a few friends. Came in today so no, I havent read the book. Based review on these factors: book's what I wanted, arrived quickly, and no damage in transit. Five stars. See I'm that easy to deal w. Update: Read book, and honestly the writing style of the author kinda sucked. The begining was especially treacherous ya have to get used to her long windbagged writing style. I found the concept/plot interesting but writing style irritating. I gotta withdraw my 5 to a 3. Sorry, less is more."
4,Touching Tale of the Afterlife,"I didn't exactly know what I was going to be getting into when I bought this book, but I loved, it. All I knew was that a boy saw a ghost and they fell in love. Yet this touching YA tale goes beyond their love and delves into the complexities of family life and what affects us. I recommend it to lovers of romance and YA books... and perhaps even fans of the paranormal."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I really enjoyed this book. I though because it was inexpensive that the quality of writing may be poor. I was mistaken, it was well written and riveting up until the very end."
5,"Wow, completely new journey","I was immediately hooked on the 1st page and could not put the book down for more than 15 minutes to tend to my kids needs and feeding LOL! I finished this in one night, not something that I usually do, I try to prolong books but this one, I could not put down, I had to find out what would happen to their seemingly doomed fate of love, brilliant writing!!!! Love it! Look forward to reading more stories from this author!! Not something I would recommend for teenagers, but definitely something for adults to read! :)"
4,"Worth the buy, definitely.","I really liked this book, it was fluid, intrigueing, and compelling until the very end. The characters are very realistic, and the plot has just enough twists to be exciting but not overdone.4.5 out of 5 stars. Better than 4 but... not sure if it's 5."
4,A lovely book. 4 1/2 stars...,"This was a very touching book about love, redemption and forgiveness. A beautifully layered novel that I didn't want to end.This book is listed here as 'young adult', but people who are beyond this demographic, myself included, will find it to be a very satisfying read."
3,parents beware--good story but irresponsible role models,"Reading this book from an adult perspective I really had some issues with the protagonists decisions. Although it was a really good story, it does supply our young readers with some really irresponsible actions by the characters (who by the way, were 27 and 29 at the time they were deceased but ""possessed"" 15 and 17 year old bodies.)Namely, the characters had unprotected sex in their host bodies and the heroine tried to commit suicide in her host body before realizing that her host's soul might like to return. They leave their young and previously virgin hosts with all types of potential problems including unremembered sexual relations and possible teenage pregnancy (see the suicide scene where she thought that she might be pregnant). Although I did love the premise, these issues disturbed me enough to not be able to recommend this book to other parents and/or their young teenage readers."
3,Nice Read.,"This book was very interesting. I liked the author's writing style and the story held so much promise. I was riveted in the beginning but the story lost its fluidity midway. I felt that the characters and the romance between Helen and James were somewhat underdeveloped. It was a good read but I think it could've been better. Hopefully, Laura Whitcomb's sophomore effort will be a much better one."
1,MOST CLICHED BOOK OF YEAR,"If I could give A Certain Slant of Light a lower rating I would.This is the most cliched book I have read in years.Most of the modern cliches are in the book:the stupid in a war and responsible for friend's death (ghost),the stupid drowned in a cellar in a light rain (ghost),the stupid drug addict family that truly loves the family members they send to the e.r.,the stupid christian family with the standard bashing,the spirits waiting for centuries to save stupid ghosts and take them to a better place cliche.That is only the beginning of the list.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY, I wish I had."
4,A Certain Slant of Light - Paperback Book,"Have not had the opportunity to read the book yet, but the shipping time was excellent, the book was in very good condition, I would recommend this seller."
5,Why does 'Twilight' get all the glory?,"In reading this book, I was both utterly compelled by the story, the style, the character development and the carefully paced mystery, and repulsed by the sad fact that this little work will languish on library shelves while 'Twilight' and all its clones march over the world like armies of mediocrity. This author should feel pride that she has created such an excellent work. At first I was wary of the old-fashioned tone her spectral heroine had - I was afraid I wouldn't be drawn in, but held at arm's length - but soon enough I found that wasn't the case at all. She has wonderfully balanced her three worlds: the now, the previous century that Helen inhabited, and the war James fought in, so that all the different times are woven together seamlessly. I sincerely commend this book and want to add that just because it doesn't have a bunch of sequels trailing after it, or a movie deal, doesn't mean it isn't worth your time."
5,A beautiful story,I loved this book! A story told with subtle detail that can be read anew over and over again. I can't wait until her next book comes out.
4,A Certain Slant of Light,"""Someone was looking at me, a disturbing sensation if you're dead.""Helen has been dead for over one hundred years, existing as a spirit, haunting a succession of hosts who do not know she is there. Although she does not remember why she has been denied ascension to heaven, Helen is sure she did something horribly wrong in her life; something she cannot remember, something she is afraid to try to recall. And so she stays on earth, surrounded by people and yet alone.And then one day, out of nowhere, it happens. A boy, ordinary in every other respect, looks at her in the class of the high school English teacher she is haunting - looks at her and sees her. For the first time in 130 years, Helen can be with someone who knows she is there, someone who can not only see her, but who can hear her as well. Although one is flesh and one is spirit, these two are truly soul mates and they will take extraordinary measures in order to be together."
3,"Eh, only ok","Ehh. The concept is unique, but some of the events did not add to the story and I think the book would have been better without a particular one."
4,Really great read!!,I love a good ghost story so this book was right up my alley. It started off amazing then became really unrealistic but it keeps you wondering whats going to happen next! The ending was surprising too!
2,"Performance deterioted over 2 years, loud, bad shave","I was excited about getting this shaver to shave in the shower. I noticed that dry is was poor and I have a light beard! In the shower it was much better but took many passes. It would loose charge in one week and there is not a portable charger so you have to take the base with you on longer trips. It is very heavy but very well made. I would have to say I was disappointed. I just bought a Braun refurbished here for $50...and this is the best shaver by far I have ever had over 35 years of shaving. Quiet, long battery life, quick charge, easy travel cord. Try it instead."
3,ES 8066 LINEAR,"Powerful motor; Shaving closeness is similar to any Remington/Braun that I've owned in the past. Razor is heavy; will slip out of your hands, if you're not holding on tight. Side burn trimmer is not as good as Remington or Braun.The ""wet shave"" used with shaving cream or liquid soap may excite you, however be careful, due to the razor's weight it may slip right out of your hands!!Bottom line: Not any better or worse than a Remington or Braun. I'm told however the replacement screen and cutter are more expensive than Remington & comparable to Braun..."
2,disappointing,"I recently purchased this razor because of the good deal offered in my gold box. Unfortunately, this shaver was not as good as my ten-year old taped up Norelco. The shaver looks good and seems well built, but it takes a much longer time to shave my one or two day old whiskers. It also leaves a sort of sting that is hard to explain. The manufacturer recommends that you use it with a light coating of shaving gel, but I don't have time for that in the morning. It was easy to clean with water, but a dry brush works just as well. I should have read the Consumer Reports study first before buying this shaver. I would have saved the cost of shipping it back."
1,Unuseable,"This CD does not come with a vocal track or lyrics. If you do not already know the song very well, you are out of luck. Also, on some tracks, the backup singers are in a totally different key than the accompaniment music. This is the most useless piece of junk I have ever purchased."
1,No Graphics,DONT ORDER THIS ITEM IF YOU DONT KNOW THE WORDS TO THE SONGS!!! THE LYRICS DONT APPEAR ON THE SCREEN!!!
1,as bad as it gets,"Although it's been a few years since I read this book, I still remember it as one of the worst I have ever read. I remember three things in particular:1) A dramatic fight between the hero and villain which COULD have come to a nice dramatic conclusion with an attack by the monster, but which instead fizzled out anticlimactically,2) The author's invention of physical attributes on the monster which have never been described by any witness,3) A Scottish landlady who speaks with an overpowering Yiddish accent.The only moment I liked was when sonar indicated that the monster was moving across the loch to attack a two-man sub; the charcters on the shore could only call to them to escape. The idea of imminent danger with the water's surface undisturbed was an intriguing one. This single scene was not enough to save this terrible book."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought I was buying a truffle mold, truffles are round and this mold was more oval and oblong. Also i thought you put the two together to form the chocolate by filling in the other end, but that isn't the way this one works apparently. Works ok, but not what I expected."
4,Vintage California,"Thirst for the ""good old day's"" kept me wanting to see what happened and what dated reference he was going to use next. It was a standard mystery with the girl and the political bad guys, and the dumb jock, but the reference to old TV shows that are now ancient, and ethnic catagorizing were a delight. So many memories...."
3,fishy deal,"They sent me an old copy of the CD and after I posted my negative review I got promises of reimbursement. Proceed with care, therefore; there's something fishy out there. The CD as such is a gem in its genre."
2,"Very overpriced, cheap looking product","These fan blade covers are a clever alternative to replacing a fan or its blades. But, the product looks extremely cheap -- nothing we would want in our home. I would have expected a great deal more for the price. Unless you are looking for a very expensive, cheap looking solution to your fan blade replacement, I would recommend avoiding these."
4,Melville's inspiration for Moby Dick. A harrowing tale.,"Narratives of three crew members of the Whale-Ship Essex, which in 1819 was stove by a whale and sunk."
3,There are better...,This is an okay shaver. It does get rid of some of the hair on my legs but there are always a few stray hairs left and I have stubble a day or two after. I've stopped using it on my armpits because it was really uncomfortable.
2,Bad mistake!,"Don't be fooled by this shaver's cute exterior. This so called ""shaver"" does ok on legs, but stubble comes back the next day. I would not recommend trying it on armpits, it hurts and leaves red marks all over - after that you can't even put on deodorant! It sucks on the bikini area as well. And not to mention the amount of noise this lil' thing produces. In the shower it works even worse. I dropped it once and the whole thing came apart spilling out the batteries. I am totally dissapointed with it.The only thing that this shaver is good for is if u go somewhere on vacation and u won't be near a sink for a while.But for now I'm going back to shaving with a razor, much closer shave and lasts a LOT longer."
4,Happy with the razor just have to get used to it.,"I had my battery operated razor since I think I was 15 years old now I'm 31 years old it finally died on me. I used it because my underarms are very sensitive and have little bumps that would bleed when I used a real razor. They don't make my old razor anymore so I researched and found this razor(the remington smooth & silky shaver). This one has more functions than my old one so I decided to give it a try. When I first used it, it did nick me but that was the last time. I have used it for over a month and happy with it. I would have to say it's just as good as my old one and maybe even better. I also was a good price."
1,Difficult to use,I returned this product. I was unable to turn the unit on or off once the batteries were installed. The batteries blocked the on/off switch from the internal switch.
2,Womens Razor,"This product does not cut well at all. I have to go over and over mylegs to have the razor cut off all of the leg hair.Other than the cutting, the razor handles quite nicely ..."
5,LOVE IT CAN'T GO WRONG,I have had mine for several years and I'm just getting ready to replace the foils and cutters. I have NEVER been nicked before so no problems there and yeah i have stubble the day after but who wouldn't it's not a hair puller lol it shaves to your skin I just use it everyday to keep my legs smooth and soft. I also have no problems using this on my ampits no red bumps or anythingIT'S A GREAT RAZOR!
1,Ouch indeed... and rusty too...,This shaver is extremely irritating and also rusted almost instantly. Wet-dry ... not! Buy anything else before this product.
2,not a good choice,This shaver shredded my skin and did a fifth-rate job of actually shaving hair on legs. Would not endorse purchasing this shaver.
2,ok,this product was not quite what i was looking for thought had a chargere this one does notbut does the job.
4,Good information to have.,"A technical book that explains the reasons parents get angry, how that affects children, and gives suggestions on how to get control of angry emotions. Lots of data to back up their ideas. For more practical ideas on how to handle parents and kids anger I'd suggest two books by Elizabeth Pantley - Kid Cooperation (How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading) and Perfect Parenting Dictionary of 1000 Parenting Tips with entries such as: Child's Anger, Parents Anger, Disrespect, Expressions of Hate, Fighting."
4,excellent book,"I got this book during a terrible period in my life, it has helped me no end in realising what anger does to children and how to avoid it. I have used it to the letter and it works."
1,Really bad if you do not believe in reincarnation,"This book sounds exciting but when you got to the first chapter, you would realise that it is really a bad book if you do not believe in reincarnation.Other than that, it is not well written and the author tends to digress. Many of the examples cited did not help him to support his case.This is one the few books I really regret buying!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I've read the two reviews about this book, and I wish I would have read them before I went into the store and bought this book. They 100% accurate on their opinions and I would have listened to them and wouldn't have bought this book! Not only do I want my money back for this book, I want the time back that I WASTED reading this book!! And the only reason I read it all the way thru was because I didn't want to COMPLETELY waste my $20.00 for this book! This is the ONLY book that I have EVER thought of burning!!! HORRIBLE!!"
2,Lies?,"A lot of what I've read here in the book description is wrong. This is not the first book to look into the antediluvian society. There is another book called ""Fingerprints of the Gods"" which does exactly the same thing and it was printed around the mid90's. I would look into this book before buying ""Genesis Unveiled."""
5,A Very Good English Mystery,"A very good mystery set in a small English village. I like the way Teri Holbrook writes, a little quirky, but it moves along well. A young girl dies in what is at first thought to be a bicycle accident but is soon discovered to be murder. Scotland Yard is called in because the girl's employer, an American, is the widow of a terrorist who killed himself in the village church three years earlier. There is no scarcity of murder suspects as the girl's life is gradually exposed as well as the lives of many of the villagers. I read Ms. Holbrook's second book, The Grass Widow, before I read this one and liked it very much. This one, however, is even better."
5,TERIS NOVEL IS SUPERb! I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN!,I loved this book! It was awesome!!! GO BUY IT NOW!!!!! Teri Holbrook is the best writer ever!! Buy her other books too! If you love mysteries youll love this too!! NO WONDER IT WAS NOMINATED FOR NUMEROUS AWARDS! Holbrook is a genius!! i just wish i could give it more stars!!
1,A Near and Deadly Formula,"This collection of near-random paragraphs, foolish inconsistencies, and perfectly horrible analogies kept me laughing most of the evening. I am glad Holbrook acknowledged her agent and editors by name; none of them is worthy of the title."
2,Crappy Software,"BEWARE of using this if you are trying to scan to PDF - especially if you use PaperPort software. The pdfs show up with a documate watermark on them indicating that it is a trial version. GOOD LUCK getting it off...tried the ScanSoft support - they know it is an issue but their 'fix' doesn't work and you'll have to pay $40 if you want to talk to someone. Still have not figured this out. Also, pages scan at 25pp per minute once they start going through - the wait time at the start is long (even if you don't use the energy saving mode)."
1,HP does not repair scanners,"Our library purchased the hp Scanjet 8270 Document Flatbed Scanner a little over a year ago and it worked fine up until a day or two after the one-year warranty expired. It started making a whirring noise and produced an illegible image. We have been advised by HP that they do not sell parts or repair scanners because they are manufactured in a dust-free environment. We paid about $900 for the scanner. We've been unable to locate an independent company that would repair the HP scanner and so the cost expended for this scanner has proved to be cost-ineffective. Because of the no-repair feature, I do not recommend its purchase for libraries."
3,Good scanner but missing setup instuctions& mixed software,"This series of 8200 HP scanners are excellent, this one was shipped fast but it was missing the setup instructions. But it is a perfect buy. a must in the office!"
4,Best price on the net,"Stock radiator. It's a turd, and is bound to go kaput inside of 5 years. But for the price, it's a good deal."
4,works good,seems to be the same quality as original Mazda part. the price was good. shipping was quick. fixed my old leaky slave cylinder.
5,A real page-turner,"It was a real page-turner, I would highly recommend. I am hoping Jacquelin Thomas will write a sequel to this book. We love the book!"
4,Toward the Path,"DEFINING MOMENTS by Jacquelin Thomas picks up where THE PRODIGAL HUSBAND ended, four years later. Forced to leave South Carolina due to the pain associated with loving and seeking her married business partner Jake Madison, Sheila is returning home, even more bitter and angry than before.While Jake and Tori have recommitted themselves to one another, Tori has still been unable to forgive Sheila. When Tori learns that her best friend, Nicholas, is caught in her dangerous web, she's certain it's only to spew more confusion.DEFINING MOMENTS is a thought-provoking read. Readers witness Sheila's acceptance of God and how she not only learns to love, but to forgive. I've had this book so long and didn't realize that the two stories were connected. I wish I had, because it's been so long I couldn't recall all of the details of the first story."
5,great condition...!,The book was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner. I recommend this product to anyone.
2,REQUEST TO ALL REVIEWERS,"Can we NOT re-tell the entire book when posting a review??? More than once I've ended up not buying a book - not because of a bad review, but because after reading the reviews I already knew the beginning, middle, and ending of the book! This is silly and extremely inconsiderate.A review is where you give your opinion about the book and/or the author. That's what we want here. Cliff-notes is where you re-write the book, giving away details and plots and endings.That's NOT what we want here. It's just common sense. Please."
1,Disappointing on two levels,"I was disappointed in this book first by the quality of the binding. By the end of the book I had a half dozen loose pages falling out from the low quaity of the binding.My second disappointment was the actual content. The case studies appeared as 5th generation photo-copies and were barely readable. The writing style was rambling and didn't bring much of anything useful to light until near the book's end.Overall, a near waste of reading time."
2,Printing Problems,"This book has some printing problems, some of the pages you can't even read the text in it and it is wiped off. It is not the problem of Amazon but the printer problem"
5,I've been using these books for 3 weeks,"I ordered these books a month ago and I have been delighted with the ease of use and the wonderful experience of reading to my son, Tyler. He is 6 months old and enjoys when I make silly faces and voices for him. I would recommend these books to new moms and experienced moms."
5,Interested in my baby's development,"I'm interested in early development (i.e. even for my newborn). I've had many other mothers recommend CDs and videos such as Baby Einstein, but liked the higher interaction that reading books provides. Also, I'm a first time mother, so I'm really walking into new territory. Bonding with Baby books seem to offer the kind of guidance I'm looking for."
5,Bonding With Baby Books,"These books should be on every new parents' gift registry. Had the books been around when my children were infants, they would have been on the top of my wish list.I reviewed my copies of the books recently and was most impressed with the beauty and simplicity of the books. These books will do much to support both the social and emotional development of infants, as well as the overall attachment process. Our Early Head Start program looks forward to using the books with new parents."
5,Great books for bonding with my baby,"Although my baby is only 8 weeks old we already have lots of baby books that have been given to us. But I liked that your books have the purpose of ""bonding"" with baby. The fact that some proceeds go to charity made it doubly enticing to me. Lastly the price is reasonable."
3,Not his best,"I must say I read this book and I wet myself. It is a riveting sci-fi thriller that really puts you on the edge of your seat. It got especially philosophical when Prince Myshkin says ""Come hither aliens and dance, dance if you want to"". The idea that it doesn't read well in translation is not quite right. It conveys the same thoughts actually quite well, and I have read the original and seen the movie, which strangely was called ""Independence Day"". But Will Smith did a wonderful job.But if you want to good cozy with Dosti, chk out Brothers Karamazov and his great book S & M"
1,clumsy,"The IdiotI am a great lover of Dostoevsky. I found this translation so inept and clumsy that I abandonned it.To be honest,I found I was spending a lot of time trying to decipher individual sentences and no, a wealthy middle-class Russian such as Ivan Fyodorovich, would have been unlikely to call his wife ""my friend"". That's when I gave up!"
2,Translators are actually Pevear and Volokhonsky--not Garnett/Hruska,"I'm primarily evaluating the Kindle product, not the book itself. The listing misidentifies the translators--a shame, because I was looking for the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation and only found this by chance.So, that's a problem I'm hoping they will correct (I was advised by customer service to convey this issue via feedback.)Other than that, the book (like so many Kindle books) is very expensive--esp. as it doesn't have X-ray or a working TOC.Re the quality of the book itself: I love these translators. And it is, of course, Dostoevsky. 'Nuff said."
4,"Great book, good translation",Started reading another translation of this book while I waited for this to arrive and comparatively this one seems much truer (although slightly more complex - the other translation seemed to over-simplified) and the notes in the back are great.
2,"Sorry, I Didn't Like It","There is a difference between an unhelpful review and one you simply just don't agree with. Before hitting the ""unhelpful"" button on my review, why not actually read what I have to say and see if you can possibly think that I might have a point. In any case, I did spend the time reading the entire book and did express my sincere opinion, so if you can't bring yourself to hit the ""helpful"" button, just do nothing. OK?Sorry Russian Lit fans, but I really did not like this book. It was tedious for the most part, and the dialogue left much to be desired to put it mildly. When I got to the end, I was relieved to be done with the book, but even the ending was not very good. If there was a real point to this book, I just didn't see it.I'd say skip this one. I'm giving it 2 stars, and I feel that I am being very generous."
4,Just getting started,"I'm not very far into the book just yet, but I'm enjoying it. I find it enterntaining and the writing to have a nice flow. I bought the book on a whim, and my husband was surprised to see me reading it. I tend to fluctuate between Brett East Ellis, David Sedaris, and chick lit. So far, I'm happy I bought it and look forward to getting a little deeper into the story line."
2,Not Up To His Usual Standard,"I wonder why F.D bothered to scribble this overlong, boring novel. After Crime and Punishment and the Brothers K, this is a serious let down. The style is all wrong; the plot is extremely numbing; very little to enjoy here. Had to slog and slog and slog my way through. Far too many characters floating in and out; too many subplots of subplots; too much overall. By far his worse writing. Should have been edited down by at least 100 pages. I read that he changed his mind about the plot several times and it shows. Badly. I know he was trying a new form of writing, but this is a failure all round. IF you have the patience of a saint and have a LONG attention span, this book might be for you."
5,Terrific!,"I've owned Braun's, Norelco's and Remmington's. This Panasonic is a very nice electric for an incredibly low price. One blade (the only way to go), good power/torque, very sharp. Can't go wrong with this shaver."
4,Great For A Quick Shave,This is a great product for a quick shave. I use it at work in the evening if I have a client engagement/dinner. I would not recommend it for regular morning use.
4,I like this shaver better than a model that's more than twice the cost.,"I recently purchased a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver for $67.47. After using it for several months I decided to go back to the model similar to the one I have been using for many years. I then ordered the Panasonic ES3041K Sonic Shaving Wet Dry Rechargeable Shaver for $24.99. Actually, I purchases two of them to have one for back-up. Lesson learned: ""Paying more doesn't necessarily get you more"". I get the best shave with model ES3041K. It gives me an very close shave and is most comfortable to use. I also like the long hair trimmer better than the more costly model. The difference in the shavers is the lesser priced one has a foil head, which works best for me."
2,Didn't have much luck with this one,"I've been using electric shavers for 30+ years, and bought this one to replace my worn-out Norelco triple rotary type device. From day one, this shaver didn't do the job. The instructions say to give it a few weeks so your skin can ""adapt"" to it (whatever that means - probably more accurate to say that your shaving technique will adapt to it since I don't think my skin actually went through any sort of transformation!). Unfortunately, it never got better. I have changed the foil a few times over the past year on the assumption that it may be dull, but no matter what, it takes several passes to cut through a day old beard, and even then leaves several stray hairs that cannot be cut no matter how many passes or from which angle or direction you make the pass. To get these stray hairs, I usually end up doing a ""touch up"" with a disposible razor blade, which sort of defeats the purpose of owning the electric device."
3,Value for price (with reservations),"The best thing about this product is its price as it is extremely delicate (the screen had holes in it within a month of receiving it) and has to be charged fairly often; also, it performs best as a wet shaver."
2,Not enjoying it,"Firstly, i had to wait forever to get this shipped. when it finally arrived, i was not very satisfied. been using it for about 2 weeks now, but i think im gonna stop. it doesnt get whole sections, and i end up looking like a moth-eaten dog. i dont know why."
1,Ruined my neck on Xmas DAY!!,I got this shaver because in the early 90's I owned a tiny Panasonic travel shaver that worked great. This was my first wet shaver tryout and it became a nightmare! I used it with shaving foam and had to go over and over my neck until I had a raw mess like hamburger meat! I waited to try it again because it says to stick with it so your beard/skin get used to it-BAD IDEA! I actually took pictures of my wrecked neck and sent to Panasonic and asked for the dual foil they sent the 4025 and I hope it's not more of the same. I will write a review for that one too after I very reluctantly try that one.
4,bristles,I'm new to electric shavers but pleased with this gadget. It's really surprisingly waterproof and easy to maintain. I still have to learn how to keep skin taut to avoid scrapes. Seems to work well.
1,Doesn't Work!,"I bought this for my husband. He used it with lather on his face, and it did not remove the hair. He tried to use more pressure, but only succeeded in cutting his skin, not the hair. I also tried it on my dry leg with no effect. Disappointed!"
5,Good Buy,I have had more expensive panasonic shavers for years and this one works just as well if not better. Definitely an amazing deal in light of what the shavers cost at retail outlets. This one has no expensive frills and I don't miss them at all.
2,Shaver,Not happy with this one. My son used it a few times and no matter what he tried it just doesn't work well. Waited too long to send it back so we got stuck with it.
1,Doesn't work for everyone,"Bought this for my son for Christmas based on the wonderful reviews. He used it for a couple of weeks and tried to adjust to it. But, he looked like he got in a fight with a lawnmower and lost. It just butchered his face and he finally just tossed it in the trash and went back to disposables."
2,Unimpressed,"I bought this shaver for my husband, who had been using a disposable blade shaver since his Norelco died. He was, as he put it, spectacularly unimpressed. No matter how many times he went over the skin, he could still feel stubble, and he ended up with his skin irritated from his efforts. He used the Panasonic for a couple of weeks, then went back to the blade and was shocked at how effortlessly smooth his face was. Not recommended."
1,Awful,"This book was terrible. I couldn't stand another minute of Caitlin and her beyond haughtiness. Sometimes the female lead is a bit haughty. Then you have ones like this, who actually lean forward to the lawyer could see inside her shirt, just so she could get her way. Besides her conceited attitude, and her selfish thinking, she was just plain rude! She really didn't care about anyone's feelings but her own.Wade was a good character, and I was so disgusted by Caitlin, I found myself wishing he would just leave her and go off with the sweet Luanne....That would have been a better story itself!This story might have been halfway decent, had Gregory wrote the scene where the truth comes out, a LOT earlier. Not on the third to last page."
4,A Ranch to Share,"Caitlin and her half sister come west to sell her father's ranch. She finds that her ownership of the ranch is shared with Wade Barclay and his brothers that her father raised. She also must live at the ranch for one year. Caitlin and Wade have a love/hate relationship. The sparks of anger fly between the two and the sparks of love. It is a hard book to put down before you read that last paragraph. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
2,GENERIC WESTERN ROMANCE---,"Story and characters were rather bland and after finishing, it didn't leave me with a rosy glow...more like a disappointment in the innate evils of man (and woman.) Complete with the ordinary murderers, cattle rustlers, and ranch coveters; this story drug on way too long. It didn't help that I found the hero un endearing and the heroine downright bitchy."
4,An Overlooked Gem of Metal,"I saw this on someone's best Metal list and thought.....yeah...I gotta go concur, only to find that there is only one review of this so far but it isn't the guy who put it on the list!!Anyway.....I saw Sword in a club in Atlanta in 86-87, just happened to be there, had never heard of them, but they caught my eye (ear)!! It took 4-6 months until I saw this CD and I bought it immediately!!! Great balls to the wall metal with good guitar work from a left handed guitarist and good, strong vocals!! Unfortunately, I never saw them again though they did release a 2nd CD, which wasn't quite as good as this one but still worth searching out.The track list is 1 - F.T.W. (Follow the Wheels) 2 - Children of Heaven 3 - Stoned Again 4 - Dare to Spit 5 - Outta Control 6 - The End of the Night 7 - Runaway 8 - Where to Hide 9 - Stuck in Rock 10 - Evil SpellIf you like good metal seek out a used copy. It's worth it for #s 1, 3, 4 & 10 alone!!!"
4,Excellent!,"I had the cassette and now I own the LP, but I can't find the cd. This is ""metal"" at it's finest. The best song on it has to be ""Stoned Again"". You can't go wrong here."
5,Must Have CD if you like straight forward metal,"In 1987, a friend had Metalized on cassette and I was amazed at the quality of every song. Killer riffs abound on this one and it's a shame the band didn't become a huge hit. I have it on CD now and never tire of hearing this blast of '80's metal with no pop or hair influence, no speed or thrash, just straight forward heavy metal that reminds me of Krokus or Judas Priest. Buy this and you will not regret it."
4,Not THE Sword,"Decent strait forward Heavy Metal from the 80's. This is NOT The Sword, just Sword. The Sword = Texas, Sword(disbanded) = Quebec. They do not have any shared members. Thank you [...]"
1,"I am a fan of ""The Sword"" and I hated this","Being a huge fan of the band ""The Sword"", (makers of the delicious rock-metal awesomeness ""Age of Winters"" and ""Gods of the Earth"") I was seriously disappointed with this album. I happened upon it while searching for the sword, and after reading some reviews that reassured me I'd like it a lot, I caved and bought it.Don't make the same mistake.This album would be good for people who grew up in the late 60's or 70's. I weep to remember the sound of my heart breaking when I heard the first few minutes of the cd. I could tell right away that I had made a mistake.DO NOT BUY THIS just because the name is so similar; the music is not at all similar. I say this because there are those who would like it while disliking The Sword. Everyone's preferences are different and I mean no offense to the tastes of others. I'm just saying that I made a mistake and I don't want others like me to make the same mistake.Thanks."
2,"This in NOT the same band that recorded Age Of Winters, etc.!","If you are looking for the third album from The Sword that recorded Age Of Winters and Gods Of The Earth and buy this you will be sadly disappointed as I was. If you're into that 80's retro hair band pop-metal sound then by all means check this version of ""The Sword"" out. Amazon should make a note that there are two COMPLETELY different bands here. If you are looking for the third release from the good The Sword, Warp Riders will be available on August 24, 2010. You can buy it from the real The Sword's website. The previews of it totally rock. No, I'm not affiliated with them at all."
1,Over priced,"These are $1 a bag at the hair store. Unless the price is including shipping before checkout, if not, then wow that's a lot for the rubberbands."
4,Speedy service,The product was shipped very quickly and was just as described. I ordered all these rubber bands for a project about which I knew nothing so any disappointment was not the result of the product but as a result of my lack of knowledge and pre-planning.
2,Cheap,"I was intrigued by the gap wire layout in the same handle as the feeler gauges. Sadly, this is a cheap little item. The wires are encased in a piece of thin folded metal, and they pushed through on the first use. The metal piece itself twisted badly where it connects to the handle as well. The feeler gauges are typical, and functional as any other, but there are better sets out there."
1,Don't bother,"I must admit that my review is pretty biased because I didn't even finish the book, but I did, painfully, get through the first 100 pages. Suze was a fun character but nothing about Lloyd appealed to me. His sequences were a bore to read about.The plot developed slowly but I figured that maybe it was just because I hadn't gotten far enough into the book. I vowed to get to page 100 and assess after I reached that hurdle. By page 100 I still wasn't intrigued.Further, out of curiosity I skipped to the last few chapters and read those to see if the book had gotten any better. Apparently, it hadn't. The ending was pretty cheesy.I'm glad that I didn't waste my time reading the other 200 pages - you shouldn't bother with the book either."
2,Not that interesting,"I thought I would really like the basic premise of this book.A New Yorker and a Londonner ""exchange"" jobs in each other's cities and proceed to discover the city they are in and, of course, each other.For some reason, this book did not work. The story felt stilted and disjointed and I did not enjoy any of the characters very much.Unfortunately this book was also extremely boring, never rising above a two star rating."
4,A Great Summer in the City,This book was really interesting. The story was well thought out and there were some unexpected twists thrown in. This one is not predictable and boring like other books that I have read. The idea behind the story is fantastic and I have not read another book like this one.
5,You Matter More Than You Think,"This is a great book. I read a copy I borrowed twice. Then, I decided to buy one for myself and buy a second copy for a gift."
5,Using this as a gravy boat,"I love the Mikasa Parchment design! I think it's gorgeous and incredibly affordable. I came to Amazon to purchase a matching gravy boat, but found that the gravy boat design does not have a handle and is instead double spouted. I opted to buy the creamer and use it as a gravy boat stand in. Looks beautiful, works perfectly, and cheaper than the gravy boat. Of course, it doesn't have a platter to sit on, but I use a teacup saucer. The creamer is slightly larger than a teacup from the Parchment set, so you may have to refill it, but I was happy with the trade-off."
4,B.B. meets Benson & the Winters,This is a release of a show recorded in 1978 in New York; a bit of magic captured when George Benson and Johnny & Edgar Winter join B.B. for a blues clinic.A couple of killer extended blues jams with George & B.B. trading licks straight from blues heaven.Definitely a keeper.
1,Didn't emulate Frontpage website,The product seemed to be okay except it did not emulate Frontpage. Their technical Support affirmed this.
3,good,pretty much what they say it is other than the annoying display that comes on every time you start your computer
4,Web Publisher,This is great web publishing software. It makes it easy for novices to get a site up and also allows those with more experience to write code if desired. The Namo has a free trial for 30 days go to there website to try it and then buy it on amazon for a much better price
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This is absolutely the WORST product of its kind on the market that I have ever tried. Constantly crashes, slow performance, will not save a file on your server without a huge hassle (fails to save your changes or simple deletes them during upload) and easily triggers servers like 1&1 to shut you out, thinking you are a hacker when you need to upload corrections to your file, such as when upload a file, test it on the web, see you made a typo & need to correct it. Typically you get shut out then Namo crashes, so you lose your work and have to start over again.I have wasted so many hours messing with Namo it is sickening. I cannot stress just how horrible this thing is!"
3,Received broken merchandise,"When we received our package, it was stained on the bottom. When we opened it, it was full of broken glass. We had ordered 3 bottles of salmon eggs and some fish hooks -- all covered in oil. The bottle of cheese bait eggs were broken and leaked everywhere. These salmon eggs are in glass bottles and the only protection used was some crumbled newspaper on the bottom. I emailed them about the broken bottle, the oily mess and told them about the poor packing material. They offered to replace just the bottle of cheese bait eggs. Very little effort to satisfy this customer. I think about them everytime I use the other oil stained jars. Bait was great -- customer service is poor. Sandra"
5,Damn Fine Stuff,"I havent read a book this freakin good since I got out of prison. I loved it, Todd Noker keep up the good work!! A book about loss and the loss of family and then family comes back again."
2,rather boring,"The thing about this book, is, Fisher tries to come across as someonewith more knowledge about why people act the way they do, than she actually has.Frustrating read."
3,Not as good as her new book,My what a few years does for Amy. Her new book is so much better than this one. I think we can all forgive her tresspasses since Joey's wife has forgiven her.
4,Why Amy Did What She Did,"Amy Fisher is blunt and matter of fact about what happened, and she makes no excuses nor blames anyone else for what she did. However, the reader can understand the state of mind that she was in, and at the age she was, she was extremely susceptible to the control and influence of Joey Buttafuoco. Apparently she was molested as a child by a relative that she refused to name in the book, although her mother left her father soon after, so you can deduce from that what you will.I also wonder how blind Mary Jo could be to Joey's repeated infidelities. In all interviews, she seemed to see only one side of the story - not her own, but Joey's. Why the blind devotion?"
2,My Lucy Review,"I bought this DVD at Walgreen's in the dollar section of the store. It was O.K., but you could find something better. But anyway, I enjoyed it."
2,not great,"this movie to me was not that great, a B movie,the only thing going for it was Kellan Lutz. I'm glad he's moved up to better movies."
2,Not my style,"This creature feature follows the formula for films of its kind: a couple of rich twentysomethings find themselves stranded in an unknown area where bloodthirsty creatures await to pick them off one by one. I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies, so it was tough for me to really get into this one. Overall the film itself is put together well and played out nicely, but it doesn't do enough differently for me to get me to change my thoughts on the genre.Source: criticnic.com 3-October-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate"
