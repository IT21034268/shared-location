1,garbage,"I rented this because the ads when it was released in theaters made it look like a fun movie. Well this is one of those movies where all the good parts are in the ads. If you are interested in this movie, look up the ads on Youtube and save your money. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why in the world did Edwards James Olmos sign up for this trash?"
3,ok,"It will be a short review, I didn't find the movie bad, it was ok, but this movie just make me miss Bruce Lee wonderful physique and acrobatics, irreplaceable."
2,pretty awful,"Seth Rogan - stick to stupid brainless comedies. You're not an action star. As for Jay Chou, you were better than Seth Rogan, but really??? Why couldn't we get a Johnny Nguyen or that kid from IP Man: Legend Begins to play this role. A real martial artist."
1,Goes for laughs instead of an actual story,"As others have said, this is a very disappointing film. I would even say it was the worst action hero film I have seen to date. The reason for that was Rogan (who I normally love)decided to go for laughs instead of making a movie based on the actual Green Hornet of the past. It really seemed like he and his friends were doing a parody more than a real movie. I always try to support the 3D Blu Ray releases but cannot bring myself to buy this garbage."
1,God Awful Stupid Movie!!!!,"Hollywood has done it again!! It has taken a once proud, well produced franchise from the 60's and has disintegrated the ""Green Hornet"" name. Congratulations, Hollywood!!!Maybe it is all an evil plot by some evil dictator or mad scientist....simply dumb down the masses with idiotic movies that contain a lot of explosions, bikini clad bimbos and stupid dialogue and then take control of the planet earth. Well....it's quite a possibility if too many more movies like the Green Hornet are made.The only redeeming feature of this movie is the portrayal of Cato by Jay Chou. One can get the sense that he was trying to stay true to the Cato in the 60's shows but Seth Rogen made it virtually impossible. Aside from Chou, the acting is horrible and the plot is so flipping predictable that the average child would get bored after an hour.Stay away from this movie if you have any respect for your brain cells!!!!"
2,This is somewhat silly,"This film is a non-traditional version of the Green Hornet and is somewhat silly. The Green Hornet is a slightly overweight rich boy who was a playboy doing silly things. When his father dies, he pals up with his father's servant who made coffee for him, and decides to engage in even more difficult pranks, to become a better gangster than anyone else. His side kick is an expert at hand to hand combat, but the Green Hornet is little more than a bumbling fool. Thus, he is not a savior, but a foolish gangster."
2,Should Not Have Been Made...,"The Green Hornet is an outdated character. It was probably cool and exciting back in the days when a guy wearing a halloween ballroom mask was cool,m but like Superman, they cannot fly in this era.I would say pass on this all together. They had too many 1960's references from Kato's clothes, to the cars to the music although it was supposed to take place now. This movie sucked and the cahracter was not one that people wanted on film. Bruce Lee's The Green Hornet may be old, but at least you would want to see that because his career was cut short, and his superior skills. At least this film was funny. That is the ONLY thing that saved this for me. Is it just me or is Cameron Diaz an ugly broad?"
1,Worst movie ever - maybe it would better in Russian,"Can I please get my money back -I will never get the time back that I spent watching it. 2 hours of Seth Rogen feeding what must be a monster ego - what studio ever green lighted this, crap."
2,Boring+Uninteresting= The Green Hornet,"I walked into this with very little hope and when I was watching it with my friend I soon became bored and wanted deperately to leave.There is no hook here that pulls the audience in, nor do you relate to any of the characters. This movie is not funny, the action is okay, and it just did not cut it for me."
3,The Greenest Movie Of The Year!,"The Green Hornet is another box-office hit that proves that teenagers decide what movies become box-office hits. There is nothing much here for adults, but the 13 year old boy inside of me dug some of the silly humor and action. Seth Rogan is kind of funny. Cameron Diaz is pretty, and also pretty wasted here. James Franco shows up for a couple of minutes and then gets blown...up. End of story."
1,Sorry excuse for entertainment.,"The only saving grace is that I did not purchase this ""movie"" or view it at a theater. I rented it. But, even with that, it was a waste of money for the rental and electricity to operate the electronics to view it. I am ashamed to admit that I made it through almost 30 minutes. What a waste of human intelligence to write, produce and ""act"" in this film."
2,Seth Rogen should not be involved on any screenplay collaboration,"That was probably the biggest mistake with the making of this film. Rogen pretty much brought his Pineapple express, Observe and report, and Zack and Miri characters and mashed them all into Britt Reid.That wasn't a good idea, since most, if not all comic book heroes don't throw F bombs into every other sentence. Comedy in a comic book hero is one thing, but it shouldn't be over the top.This is a PG-13 movie, but even that should be a strong 13 with all the vulgar language. I like vulgarity as much as the next guy, but watching it with my pre-teen child was not a good idea on my part."
1,"The Worst ""Superhero"" Movie...EVER!","I'll keep this review short and brief...the way this ""film"" should have been!Regardless whether we're talking about a pulp fiction vigilante, radio serial adventurer, or comic book crime fighter, the one thing a hero can't be is selfish or cowardly.And unfortunately, Seth Rogen's portrayal of the classic radio serial vigilante of the '30's and '40's, and tv masked crime fighter of the 1960's (for which this movie is based on) contains both of those traits.Sure, the hero can (and should) have flaws. That's what makes him identifiable to the audience.But THIS ""Green Hornet"" actually ABANDONS Kato during a botched sting. He even yells out, ""Every man for himself!""At that point, I knew I wasted money seeing this.It wouldn't be fair to compare Seth Rogen to either Gordon Jones (the movie matinee serial) or Van Williams (the '60's tv show), since a movie and actor should be taken on his own merits.But a cowardly, selfish ""hero?""Forget it!"
2,A bomb,I was so disappointed in this movie. Seth Rogen's portrayal of Britt Reid as sniveling and whiny is not my idea of a superhero. I would have given this a one-star rating except for the fact that I enjoyed Jay Chou (Kato) and hope to see him again.
2,WAIT......I thought this was a super-hero movie???,"In my opinion.....REALLY??? After watching this, I just couldn't get with it. From beginning to end, this character wasn't taken seriously, in fact, if it wasn't for the character of KATO and BLACK BEAUTY, I would have fallen to sleep on it long before the movie ended. I don't mind restructuring characters as long as there is a meaning and a purpose at the end. If THE GREEN HORNET was meant to be that bumbling, then a new actor should have been introduced. It would have made the movie more believeable and flow that much smoother. Using a known actor who has made a nice living off of being ""the loveable, yet (and I use the word again) bumbling guy"" kinda killed it for me and made the movie more of a financial waste of time and resources instead of bringing to life a character strong enough to warrant a sequel...I mean, a REAL sequel."
1,Popcorn movie for kids... nothing more.,This movie simply lacks everything. The acting is so bad that I can't find the words to describe it. Horrible might even be a compliment. I only watched this movie because of the more-than-brilliant CHRISTOPHER WALTZ who is one of the finest actors of all time. I've seen most of his german movies and I cannot think of the slightest reason why he signed up for this crap. Beats me totally.I actually fast forwarded most of the movie because it became unbearable to watch.
2,Ummmmm,"did not like the movie, the main guy whom was green hornet did not play his part good but the butler did"
2,Awesome car... and that's about it.,"Never been a Rogan fan but I tried to not let that prejudice me against Green Hornet. It didn't help. If you liked the Batman TV series, with Adam West and Burt Ward, then you... might... like this. It's not a good action film and it's not a good comedy. It's not a horrible movie but it's not good either. I know that sounds wishy-washy, but that's the feeling I got after the movie. ""Meh..."" They tried to make this a comedy but, for me, it didn't work. In my humble opinion, this should've been a much darker movie. ""Dark"" like Sin City ??? Maybe. Sadly, the only thing I walked away from the movie with was the Black Beauty. Awesome car."
1,Oh! It had such possibilities,"So, they had a chance to build on the legends of the Reed family. The Lone Ranger and The Green Hornet.And short and sweet, ""THEY BLEW IT!""This Movie isn't worth anything. They made this movie into a mockery of two great American legends by trying to turn this movie into a comedy. What a waste of time and money."
1,Waste of money for the watcher and the studio,"Kind of movie that makes you wonder who actually thought this was worth spending money on from both producing it and then paying money to watch it.I agree that the original Green Hornet series itself was a bit campy but this movie had the budget to make it really good. They fail in all fronts: cast (other than the actor who played Kato), plot, etc.I hope sometime in the future, another studio will do it right. Until then, don't waste your money or a minute of your time."
1,The Green Jerk,"I have the 1930, 1940, and the 1970 of the Green Hornet and this movie make him out to be a jerk.What a disgrace on how the Hornet is portray in this slop of a so-called movie, even his clothes is a digrace."
1,Waste of Time and Money,The movie would have been better with the sound off. The dialogue was ridiculous. It was like totally unscripted; they may as well have had the actors role play the whole scene. The trailer was better than the whole movie. I thought from the trailer that this would be a great movie--but what a waste of my time and money. The action and special effects were good--too bad the writters and script were so terrible. No wonder I didn't even know it was in the theater until it had passed through and was on it's way to DVD no one dared admit they had seen it.
4,Protect the Law by Breaking It!!!,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I haven't seen the tv series, so I couldn't compare it. This movie has a lot of action, comedy, and explosions! Seth Rogen stars as Britt Reid, a slacker son of the publisher of The Daily Sentinel. When his father dies, Britt fires the staff, except for Kato, who makes his coffee. Britt and Kato become friends and decide to cut the head of his dad's memorial statue. During this, they save a couple from a gang. They decide to become masked crimefighters and pose as villians. He decides to call himself 'The Green Hornet' They soon must deal with a Russian gangster named Chudnofsky. If you love action and comedy, you'll love THE GREEN HORNET!!!"
1,"Bad, Terrible, Awful, Stupid, Juvenile . . . NOT GOOD",Saw this waste of film on an international flight across the Pacific Ocean . . . so bad I thought of asking the airline to refund part of my ticket price. This film deserves to be destroyed -- all copies -- everywhere . . .
2,What Superhero,"This is the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. I've seen Catwoman, The Punisher, Electra but this one takes the cake. First off Seth Rogen is completely miscast in this film. He's out of his element here. The character Brit Reid is annoying as heck. This character off as the poor man version of Batman. He's a wanna be Batman. The only reason I gave this money a two stars it was Jay Chou. He's what kept the audience interested. If they do sequel please have Jay Chou. This movie shouldn't have never been in 3D. I consider this a rental or wait for cable."
1,Swat this Hornet so it won't fly again.,"Take all of the bad parts of the prior reviews, multiply by 10, and that's about where I was on this one. The part that almost made me throw something was where they went to Diaz's house while the cops were going door-to-door and she was basically smacking them around like a couple of 2 year olds. Pathetic and embarassing."
1,Schizophrenic Superhero,"Awful. Tedious. Waste of talent. The excessive wanton destruction that takes place in this comedy(?) reminds me of Spielberg's 1941. You can tell that the screenwriters have run out of ideas when they fill up the time with scene after scene of that favorite staple of the contemporary formula action movie...non-ending machine gun fire, that tears up the sets, makes lots of noise...and does little else. The movie started out all right, but then keeps bouncing back and forth between serious (?) scenes, and then slapstick, and then vulgarity and back to serious again, and then on ...and on... and....oh? is that the sound of me snoring through the ""action"" scenes? The star of the movie? The Black Beauty, and of course, they have to go overboard with that, too. Not even worth a rent."
1,First Time I Ever Rooted For The Hero To Lose,"The writers of this film had diaper rash of the brain....Like litte children on a playground , they had to throw as much filthy language around as they could and I NEVER so disliked a hero...obnoxious, unfunny, ego-centric and STUPID...Half way through the film, I was rooting for the villian....to see a classic Green Hornet look up the 1940's serial...I shouldn't be too upset..Lately Hollywood has been turning our more crap and an atomic powered outhouse..."
1,"Pretending losers can achieve, wake me when they do a REAL Green Hornet","This was the WORST insult to a Green Hornet fan imaginable. They take a frat boy who belongs in court for sexual harassment and pretend even losers can have mojo. Whatever happened to achievers being called to an ever higher level of service. America, go on pretending that a debauched life with no discipline can make a super hero. I still remember getting my Green Hornet ring in a bag of Wise potato chips as a kid in the '60's."
1,Dont Bother to watch,"I waited so long to see the Green Hornet and was totally disappointed. The writers actors, director ruined it with exception for Kato who was great in his action shots.The movie was poorly cast with exception of Kato. However, the story line was ridiculous and I was pretty amazed this didn't go straight to DVD. While I agree that this should never have been a feature film I don't want it to rate a B movie since some B films I have actually enjoyed to watch and this wasn't one of them. They took a classic and ruined it."
1,Skip the 3D version.,The 3D version of the film was converted from 2D to 3D after filming and most of the film is not in 3D at all. It's a useless conversion and a good idea would be to skip the 3D version if you plan on purchasing the film. Just get the standard Blu Ray disc and save yourselves the $5 - $10 on the 3D disc.
3,A Lost Opportunity,"This film can't decide what genre it's supposed to be. The writers spent too much time trying to make Seth Rogen funny - which is wasted time because he already IS funny - and not enough time writing a decent story. There's a couple of fun moments but this was not nearly as comical as the theatrical previews made it look. By the time the last 15 minutes came 'round I was watching the clock as it was dragging to the inevitable conclusion. This cast and the premise of an inept, immature buffoon stealing the lime light along with an ingenious, talented and deadly sidekick who gets no credit could have been wickedly funny. Somehow they missed the mark."
2,Leave the icons alone,"This movie totally sucks unless you know absolutely nothing about the television series. Of late the trend has been to take tv shows or older movies and make them funny. Big mistake, Green Hornet was never meant to be funny. I am not saying that there weren't funny moments in the tv show because there was. Like when Bruce got stuffed in to the garbage can by one of the crazier villians on the show. Al films have this in them, some than others but this was atrocious. The only good thing was the car and that was blown out of proportion as well. Yes, I know there is no Bruce Lee around to fill in the gaps in this movies but even he couldn't have saved it. I knew it was in trouble when they let Seth Rogen be the lead in it, it was down hill from that moment on. I would like to see a more serious or truer version than this. Follywood please leave the originals alone."
1,Please give heed to the negative reviews or you will regret it!!!,"I read a number of reviews before ordering this movie and just a short way into the movie I was regretting not giving heed to the many negative reviews. I am just about at the one hour mark and even though I purchased the 3D version of this movie for only $14.99, I am wishing I had not wasted that money. I will have to force myself to finish this movie and hopefully, I will be able to unload it at a movie exchange store for at least a few dollars. Save your money and a couple of hours of your time and miss this turkey."
4,Green hornet saves the day,I watched this for my second time last weekend and was happily surprised by its re-watchablity. Seth is great. Kato is really good. I like this movie and would buy it.
2,More hangover then Hornet.,"I was so sad after I saw the Green Hornet,I liked the old TV show but not this movie.I was hopeing for something like BatMan 1989, what I got was Hangover well a PG one good fore kids not for me."
3,C For Effort,"There's a trend in Hollywood nowadays to re-make television shows and movies in a self-conscious ironic tone, and ""The Green Hornet"" is the latest example of this trend. There's a lot of self-deprecating humor in ""The Green Hornet,"" and everyone's having good fun, and we the audience seem to enjoy being part of the inside joke for half the movie. But eventually the cast and the audience both realize simultaneously that there's really no plot, and this movie just can't get serious enough to build any momentum.I also have to severely question the casting of Jay Chou, who is so flat and boring that he makes Seth Rogen look charming and charismatic in comparison. I suppose that in this age of globalized media it's important to have an actor who's already well-established and instantly recognized in China -- but why did it have to Jay Chou?"
3,Green Hornet,"Likes: It is an OK movie but the 3D was not all that good. I like the old comic book s being made in to movies.Dislikes: Like I said I am a sucker for the comic book s that are made in to movies especially the 3D ones. But I would expect the 3D to be much better, truthfully I would have to say that this movie looked almost the same in 2D as it did in 3D.I would say if you are going to by it don’t go for the 3D you will not notice the difference in this movie."
2,Disappointing,Very disappinted in this one. Nothing like the original series in 60's.Save your money. But the orginal series back in 60's.
2,This is not what I expected,I bought this because I thought these two were great as a radio program. This had a lot of profanity.
3,I bought this,I bought this because I like the green hornet story lines but this movie was like most of Seth Rogens other movies and to much talkie and bull. The movie other wise was far with action.
3,It was okay.,"This movie was okay. I was looking for something fun and I had fun watching it. I'd have been happier without the 'comic' aspect of the movie, but I could live with it. Some lame lines, some decent ones. There were some very decent action sequences. All in all, I found it entertaining and I can't say that about all too many things."
3,It was decent.,"This movie was ok, some of the fight scenes were not that good, while others were, the movie had some slow spots in it and the ending was kinda bad and Cameron Diaz was so out of place in the movie, I just dont see where she fit in at all. I didnt watch Green Hornet as a kid so I really didnt know what to expect but overall it was a decent movie and they did a nice job on 'pimping out the car'"
2,Green Hornet,"A horrible, poorly written, and crass movie. Highly NOT recommended. Mute it and it may be ok to watch. The casting should be a clue. Even without knowing the Green Hornet history it is not a fun film for anyone that uses more than 2 percent of their brain.I gave it a chance because I also scoffed at Michael Keaton as Batman. I was definitely wrong then. NOT this time. This beats Batman and Robin as one of the worst Superhero flicks. Luckily, it was so insignificant it did not step the genre back to the ages of Bam, Pow, and Whap!"
1,WORST MOVIE TO COME OUT OF HOLLYWOOD (and they produce A LOT of crap)!,I actually walked out of this movie as I felt my IQ slowly draining out my ears. A sad remake of a solid 60's era action hero series. Actors/Hollywood should be ashamed ... Only buy if you need the plastic for a child's arts project!
1,As bad or worse than Schumacher's Batman & Robin,"I'll keep it short and simple, this is one of the worst movies ever made. This movie deserves to be lumped in with Joel Schumacher's atrocious Batman & Robin. After seeing the trailers I was looking forward to a superhero movie with a sense of humor featuring a guy I like, Seth Rogen. This Green Hornet tries to be Pineapple Express with Rogen reprising his role from that movie and Jay Chou in a non-stoned James Franco role. Jay Chou is easily the best thing in this disaster, and talented actors like Tom Wilkinson, Edward James Olmos, and Cameron Dias are completely wasted. Go watch Pineapple Express again and wait for the sequel to that much better movie. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS! This is 2011's The Last Airbender!"
4,"Don't Know Why All the Hate, This Was a Decent Flick","I thought Seth did a great job. Kato was awesome and I really enjoyed this action comedy. 4 Stars for me. Don't listen to the negative reviews but give this a watch, you might like it."
1,Absolute Trash,"Seth Rogen lied through his teeth. He kept trying to convince people that he would do for the Hornet what Michael Keaton did for Batman. He kept saying that he would look ""cool"" and that this movie would be so different from anything he ever did, and how he took such a risk playing the character. What did he end up giving us? The same tired ""comedy"" that he always gives us. Just image his character from pineapple express wearing a mask. Thats ALL this nonsense was, in the end. He turned the character into a complete joke, for his own twisted amusement. Since this movie failed, I doubt we will be seeing a sequel with Rogen anytime soon, but heres hoping in a few years that we will get a reboot from someone who actually cares about the character, and who won't just defile the material in an attempt to give themselves an extra minute of fame."
5,Funny and exciting,"It was a a humorous film that was action-packed. Although a lot of the stunts were unrealistic, it was still a fun movie to watch. Plus, if you love Seth Rogan, you'll love this movie. He was a part of writing it!"
1,I would give it ZERO if possible,"Seth Rogen as The Green Hornet. Coming next, Seth Meyers as Superman. The witty ""Jewish"" humor is great for comedy and buffoonery. But thanks to Rogen both acting and writing this movie, we get comedy and buffoonery in both...the acting and the writing. My father used to listen to the Green Hornet on the radio as a kid. He took one look at Rogen during a trailer and got sick to his stomach. As did I."
5,I Liked It Too,So many bad reviews......so I gave it 5 stars to offset the negativity.Truth said...this probably should get a 3 and a half star rating.I thought it was extremely funny and entertaining . If you are looking for a Dark Knight type of performance.....this ain't your movie.
4,What do you guys expect from a superhero movie?!,"This movie was great! I think that the people who wrote the one star reviews were going to see ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" and got lost. This is a superhero movie not an academy award nominee. It had REAL fighting, REAL explosions, REAL car action and wrecks. Not much computer animation, and a story about friendship. It had good acting, a lot of action, romance, and likable characters. That's what superhero movies should be about. It was funny and fun, and best of all the heroes and villains screwed up sometimes. The Russian accents left much to be desired, but otherwise I liked it."
1,One of the 3 worst movies I never finsihed watching.,We sat through about 20 minutes of this movie and then both decided to leave. That statement alone should give you an idea of what we thought about this movie.
1,For 10 year olds,"Probably the worst movie I have ever bought. After five minutes, I knew I had made a huge mistake. Some say Seth Rogan is playing for laughs, but I didn't laugh once. The humor was juvenile and for the people who like juvenile jokes and reactions. Nothing remotely resembling a plotI loved the original series even though Bruce Lee was only allowed to be a stereotype. That series started the Kung Fu movie craze and got me into marital arts. It was the first time i saw that kind of fighting.Seth Rogan is no actor, he is not funny , the jokes are predictable, it should have been called Hangover 3 or Jackass 3. I was sorely disappointed that it was so bad. I write this in the hope that you save your money and check out the other feedback before you make the mistake I made. The producers obviously have no connection tot the original. They made a mockery of it.This DVD will become a coaster."
4,I liked it...,"OK, first let me say that I was never a fan of the original Green Hornet. Actually, I had never heard of the Green Hornet until I saw the trailer for it. The trailer set it up to be a fun action-comedy that doesn't try to take itself to seriously, and that is what I got. The acting was decent and the 3D was pretty good (I had expected less than average 3D due to the fact that it was converted in post=production). If you're looking for a Spider-Man 2/Dark Knight quality superhero movie than you're out of luck but the Green Hornet entertained me a that is that."
2,not what was said,"It was a blu ray green hornet, but it was a used not new and had all coupons and such removed. not even shrink wrapped. I wouldnt by again from this vendor."
2,For a super hero he swaers a lot,"For a super hero movie, the super hero does a lot of swearing. I find this objectionable. A super hero fiction or not is suppose to represent the best in satiety and not stoop down to the lower levels of it."
1,Just sucks,"People should be ashamed to produce such bad movies, It is an insult for fans to whom they owe their millios. It is nothing like the original series and the ""Hornet"" just makes an ass of himself and all the movie, never the less, that is also thanks to producers and directos uh?Superman IV was a mess like that."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was incredibly disappointed with this movie. It seemed like every other word was an expletive, which is generally used when the script and story-line are incredibly weak. This movie was NOT worth renting. We nearly quit watching it in the middle of it. I was disappointed in the PG-13 rating for the language alone. Kato's gadgets were very neat, but I expected much more from this movie and I was left sorely disappointed. This is NOT an acceptable movie for children to watch, due to the language alone."
5,Kato Really Rocks,I was interested in seeing this film remembering the prior work of the late Bruce Lee in the role of Kato. Bruce was very good in the martial arts and onscreen presence. Jay Chou was great in the role of Kato. His onscreen presence was pretty impacting and did work well with Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet. The film has good intensity and action and it flows well.
2,A ridiculous mess,"Seth Rogen is a funny guy as we all know. The idea behind the re-making of ""The Green Hornet"" in this smug, part humor part action is nothing new. Not even for Rogen. Remember ""Pineapple Express""? Well, this is no ""Pineapple Express"". In fact I'm more reminded of the 1960's ""Batman"" TV series with Adam West. Yes, I laughed a few times but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with taking comic book heroes and converting them into jokes. And if you're going to do it, maybe a more anonymous hero(s) would work better. In fact, how about ""Kick-Ass"" which is much better? Anyway, this feature falls into familiar territory. Short fights with plenty of adversaries, long fights that should have ended with 1 punch (Kato & Hornet) and a ridiculous finale that defies any reality. The filmmakers obviously had a big budget and damn, I suspect they used every bit of it, but in the end, the film doesn't hold up."
1,"What a waste of time, money and energy","I didn't make it to the end of this movie because I value the time left in my life. Good grief, what a waste of a movie."
1,HOW TO DESTROY A GREAT PROPERTY,"The Green Hornet could have been something great. If treated with the same respect as the new Batman movies, Hornet might have been something spectacular. The car, the gadgets, the martial arts, the characters are COOL and are suppose to be cool. But the ""filmmakers"" (questionable if they are) that made the Seth Groan-Again version absolutely made a travesty of a film. Crap in everyway. Horrible script. Wretched acting. Paint-by-the-numbers directing. Stupid boring cliched ""bad guy."" And worst of all they turned it all into a joke (a supposed ""comedy""). What studio execs are green-lighting this crap? Fire them all!!!"
2,Green Goof Ball,"The Green Goof Ball. Sorry, but I'm one of those who didn't like the ""idiot brother"" can't walk and chew gum at the same time take on the Green Hornet. If they'd wanted an idiot for the role, they should have just gotten Will Ferrell, he's got that down pat. And the final scene shoot out at the newspaper - what was that? The total goof ball ending to the total goof ball superhero movie. There were a couple good laughs in it, but that's it. And speaking as a big Cameron Diaz fan, she just seemed lost in this film. I saw it at the discount theater for $1.50 so I guess it was worth that, but if they'd made it $2, I would have felt over charged. I collect DVDs and am presently closing in on 2500, this one won't be added to the collection tho."
2,Zzzzzz,"I'll admit up front - I could not get through this movie. If it got better, I will never know, but 1 hour into it, I felt my life slipping away and simply could not continue. I was watching this movie with my friend and even he didn't want to finish watching it and he can watch paint dry!! Now I love all the Marvel movies. I am a adult woman and get teased all the time that I prefer to go see Thor and X-Men to romantic movies. Give me a good graphic novel and I'm happy. But this movie was dull, boring and irritating."
1,This Hornet can't deliver any sting,- Only the first 15 minutes are funny. The rest of the film is not. It's also boring.- The special effect is so so.- The acting is not engaging.
1,BAD IDEA!!!!!!!!!!,"I have'nt seen this movie and i don't want to see it. i like seth rogen but when i saw he was the sidekick in the green hornet along with this new comer playing as kato who also looks like a goofball i was highly upset! i remember the green hornet series very well and is a huge fan of bruce lee who made the show a hit in the first place; i feel this a joke and a slap in the face to such an awesome fighter and man as bruce lee along with the series. if you're going to do a remake of a bruce lee's movie, you can't half step. you got to come correct or leave it alone! to me it's like they're mocking the green hornet, making fun of it and i don't appreciate that at all because bruce lee and the series don't deserve it. they need to go back to the drawing board and try try again!!!!"
2,"Nice try, but Rogen fails","I admit I had doubts going in to this movie, I mean Seth Rogen as a super hero?? I gave it the good ol' college try and went in with an open mind. First, it couldn't make up it's mind. Rogen tried to be a playboy/comedian/action hero/serious leading man and failed miserably at all three. He wasn't funny and couldn't remain in one type of character for any length of time. I couldn't take him seriously as an action hero as he simply doesn't act or look the part. If he was serious the entire movie and acted like a bad a$$ then it may have been better.Chou plays Kato and he is pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the slow-mo fight scenes but he did a great job being funny/bad-A during the film and I hope to see him in other films. I would say with a different actor playing the green hornet it would have been a much better movie overall."
1,Mischaracterization,"It's hard to imagine a worse portrayal of the Britt Reid/Green Hornet character than is portrayed in this film. Nobody expects realism in a Green Hornet film, but the portrayal of the great hero of the dark in this movie was so absurd that it wasn't even funny. Britt was a total waste with no redeeming qualities. The film didn't adequately explain why Kato would follow such a selfish clumsy bungling loser. The producers want us to accept that Kato, who could beat up 20 professional thugs with guns all in one fell swoop, couldn't beat Britt, who had never done any fighting. Somehow, miraculously, Britt became an expert martial arts expert at the very end of the film simply by thinking like Kato. As the film ended and credits came up, my wife said, ""You couldn't pay me to watch this film a second time."" It just goes to show that better filmic technology does not make up for a lousy script and and extremely poor character development. The TV series from decades ago was much better."
1,Bug Spray Anyone?,"If you happen to hear the sound of a high pitched whistle just as you're about to hit your DVD play button be forewarned. A bomb is about to explode on the television screen. This bomb I'm speaking of can be more easily identified under the alias 'The Green Hornet'. Yes, this film IS that bad! Who would have ever thought someone would portray a superhero in such an unlikeable fashion that the audience would absolutely hate him? I wouldn't have thought it possible but then what do I know.Obviously something went horribly wrong during production. They didn't know whether they should play it straight or go with a comedy touch. The end result was neither. A word to Seth Rogen (aka: Green Hornet). Seth, green is not your color and if you ever don that mask again you may be forced to defend yourself off the screen as well as on it. As for the Hornet's trusted partner Kato (Jay Chou), he was the only redeeming part of the film. Thanks for trying your best to save this dud."
2,Terrible,"For a film that cost over $100 million to make it was awful,half the money must have gone into the vehicles in the movie as that the only good thing about it!!."
1,"Green Honet Movie, thumbs down","I watched the Green Hornet TV series that was on TV in the 1960's; I thought maybe the movie would be decent. How wrong I was. If the producers of the movie were going for a young Will Ferrell then they cast the right actor, but he was incredibly cheesy. The movie was hard to watch, it was disjointed, horrible acting on most of the actors parts. Van Williams and Bruce Lee still are the Green Hornet and his side kick. I'm glad I only spent $3.99 to rent the movie and didn't waste more money at the box office. My thanks to Van Williams and Bruce Lee for great entertainment, and ones my kids are still watching today. They both thought the TV series better than the movie."
1,"Lame, lame, lame.","Granted, I accidentally rented this movie because I'd been wanting see ""The Green Lantern"" and confused the two titles, but.. I really didn't like this movie. It contained: crass jokes, a lot of swearing, suggestive content, childish mindsets, a plot that seems as if it were written by a little kid, and action sequences that leave you saying, ""What was that?!"" Of course, this is all just opinion, but I was disappointed in this film."
3,"Not a spectacularly good movie, but a fun way to kick back for a couple of hours of entertainment","A really fun action movie with a bickering buddy/couple at its center. Not a spectacularly good movie, but a fun way to kick back for a couple of hours of entertainment which will neither challenge nor insult your intelligence. The post-converted 3-D produced a few odd visual artifacts with facial contours and especially struggled with a patterned purple shirt Seth Rogen wore in one scene."
2,More cheesy than the 60's Batman TV Show,"In the 60's the Batman TV show was cheesy, and The Green Hornet tv show was a bit dark and serious. Flash Forward to today; the current crop of Batman movies are dark and serious, while the Green Hornet movie (and I hear they are making another one) are cheesy. In fact, this movie is more cheesy than the 60's Batman tv show!There are only three things I like about this movie: Leonre Chase can kick ass unlike she did in the Green Hornet TV show; the Black Beauty is very cool; and the end credits were great! Particularly, the animated Green Hornet and Black Beauty!If you like cheesy movies, this is for you! If you want a serious Green Hornet, watch the old TV show!"
1,Is this a violent joke?,"Special effects do not a movie make. There were two TV series, both better than this bomb! Having the hornet make constant racial slurs at Kato is uncalled for. The was never a split between Kato and the hornet until this movie."
1,POINTLESS,"The only good thing about this movie is that it is so lame, there could not possibly be a sequel. On the other hand, if you enjoy Rogen's constant mumbling of wisecracks, this is the film for you."
3,I enjoyed the film up to a point...,"Much better than i taught after hearing all the negatives about this film.Im sure the old series was more serious and better in lots of ways, but thisversion tries to have fun, have action...have a bit of everything. One of theproblems is Seth himself, great for some scenes, and stupid in others. He has tolet go some of the stuff he kept from the comedies he did. I have no problemswith Kato, he is always interested in inventing things and can kick ass prettygood. The evil guys are bad but not as sadistical bad as some other. I did welcome this. And the movie cant be that bad as i did'nt fall asleep once looking at it."
2,Worst Dialog,"This action packed movie, was completely ruined with crappy dialog. It was painful to watch and in fact I skipped chapters because I could not bear to hear the pedestrian dialog. I would be amazed if the writers have a collective IQ above room temperature, because they couldn't find two SAT words to rub together.Cameron Diaz is well on her way to finding her movies in the direct-to-video category. It's unfortunate but true that the dialog writing was not on par with the action of this film."
4,The Green Hornet strikes again.,"I just watched this movie tonight and don't understand why so many people did not like it. The story starts out about a spoiled rich kid who learns there are problems in the world bigger than himself. He wants to help people and it not sure how to do it. But he becomes partners with a super talented martial artist, who happens to make a great cup of Java. This martial artist can also build just about anything. After a few bumps in the road, he figures out that in order to beat the criminals , they have to act like Criminals. Well, that is the short story anyway. The movie had enough action to keep me entertained, and i just hope the make a sequel to it. If you are not a fan of seth rogan, then you wont like the movie. But, if you like action, cool vehicles, and a little bit of comedy, you might just like this movie. Give it a shot!"
1,lousy,I am very disappointed being a great fan of the radio show and serials. Must be Seth Rogan hates the image of the hard hitting editor that makes sure justice is done so he made him into the buffoon he is made out to be in this movie. I thought about selling or giving this DVD away but I did not want to give garbage to anyone so I put it where it belonged - in the garbage.
4,A very funny action movie,"I have not seen the Green hornet original series, so my point of view is just from this movie, not the legend behind it. It is stated by the producers they made the movie so you get into it without the need to watch the series!First on... Seth Rogers, from my point of view Rogers is evolving with time! I have watched movies from him in the past,... not satisfied, but hold on, here comes the hornet!This movie is so hillarious i have watched about 4 times in just the first week!My kids adore this movie, and they are just 2 and 4 years old!!!! Could it be the trailers the bluray has (especially the one from the guys of Open season promoting 3Dtv?) but i cant complain with this buy.Highly recommended for group viewing as you all going to enjoy itSo you say,... Why 4 stars?This kind of movies has no deph or caracters deployment, just a movie for funBut you gotta have a lot of it!!"
3,Better Than The Low Ratings Tell,"Can't understand why the bad reviews, GH delivered pretty much as promised. I found it humorous enough as well having a good amount of action. I didn't rent it expecting Gone With The Wind, It is what it is....what I'd call a B Movie but a well done B movie. Though sitting through alot of subpar movies on Netflix probably helped me a bit to have a positive review :) I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if poss."
1,Seriously awful,"I don't usually leave one star reviews, but this movie was so bad it doesn't deserve anything more. Seth Rogen was terrible in this movie. He came off as whiny, immature, and completely devoid of anything resembling superhero status. The other actors were almost as bad. Edward James Olmos was completely wasted in this movie. The jokes and ""funny parts"" were not funny. I wanted to turn it off after the first 30 minutes but suffered through it becaus my spouse thought it would get better. It did not. We were both disappointed and glad it was just a rental. Don't waste your time or money."
2,What a disapointment,I'll give this 2 stars only because i really like the car and at least it wasn't Starsky & Hutch bad.
4,Well I still have not,It has been a month and one day since I have ordered this product and still have not received it I am starting to wonder if i will ever use amazon again
1,One of the dumbest movies ever made,"Both the acting and script are so poor (not to mention juvenile in context) it's hard to imagine why the license holders of this property felt inclined to offer it to the verbally challenged Seth Rogen, who is as lost in the role of the Green Hornet as Elmer Fudd would be playing Dirty Harry. Incompetent, and unapologetic in it's utter stupidity, it's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this wasted effort."
1,Car failed to carry the movie,"The car special effects failed to carry the movie. Seth Rogen attempts to make his charactor to be a product of his father's lack of guidance. Just allot of poor acting along with a plot which is attempting to be a comedy. If you wish to waste your money, this is your movie. 3D is OK but rent this for $2 and waste two hours of your life."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"This is by far the worst film I have viewed in years!!!!! Why they ever picked Seth Rogen to star as the Green Hornet is beyond me. I could put up with some of the comedy,but he was just horrible!!! I should have believed the bad reviews.If it would be possible to give it a -5 that would over rate it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on this Movie...,"I saw this movie in the theatre. We left about 2/3 of the way thru. I've never walked out of a movie and not waited to see the ending.The dialogue was dull, jokes were predictable, plot was boring and predictable, shallow characters, etc... I love super hero movies, but this movie was pretty bad.As another review said, it reaffirms my belief in humanity to see so many 1 star reviews here.Please learn from my experience and don't waste your money."
1,It is really too bad...,"It is really too bad that Seth Rogan was allowed to write this project. Comedians have a inate lack of respect for nostalgia that is essential for a free society but are consequently unable to discerne when actual homage shoud be paid. THere was a profound lack of respect for the story of the green hornet in this film and this led to a lack of focus and a level of "" screwballiness"" that was simply out of place. Comic book stories are not always comic and this was the wrong time to be playing up the bafoonery.Not worth the 4 bucks."
1,Skip this one,"There were many problems with this movie, it is hard todecide where to start. It was filled with inconsistenciesand most of it did not make sense.Were they villains or heros? They go about destroyingpublic property and fight with the bad guys. Kato is theside kick but it is as if he is the real hero. He buildsthese amazing cars in just a few days, but you don't seehow it all happens.It is not funny, it is not an action movie, no goodspecial effects, and the script is no good.I would skip this one and choose something else, thereare lot of other good movies out there."
3,"Ok movie, too much cussing","It's a great little adventure movie but had way too much cussing for our family to enjoy it. As a parent I want clean, little bit of cheesy, and adventure for my kids to watch. My kids and I liked the story, had funny parts in it, but by putting that much cussing in it it made it more for adults, but then it was too cheesy for adults so...then it just made it a dumb show for everyone. Had potential for a fun family flick but didn't make it into our collection."
3,Noisy and sort of crap,"They made this a comedy. Only it's not funny. Well, okay, the scene where the Green Hornet's 1970s Chrysler plows into the newsroom of Seth Rogan's character's newspaper is funny, with all the tschoktkees on the reporters' desks just like in real life, is funny. Otherwise, I was a little bored, despite attempts to rev this up with a rock soundtrack mixed REALLY loud. There's a lot of chasing and fighting. Too much, to the point where it becomes numbing, really. As these superhero movies go, this is just okay."
3,the green hornet,Seth acts stupid in the movie the only hero in the movie is the Asian. i love the weapons gadgets and car.
4,I really liked this film,Everybody's writing reviews about the enjoyment or not of the film. I found it entertaining> I just want to know hows the 3D version?
4,Great....to an point,"NOW Im very honest when it comes to movies. To see Seth come out of character and try to play two roles at once is kind of weird. But as the movie goes on you get used to it and laugh your butt off. Overall, this movie is alright. I wouldnt run to get it. But on the same token, if its under $20, I would get it. the 3D effect isnt there much. I didnt notice it. But the movie in general is nice.Also take into account that this is their take on the Green Hornet. So please be advise.If you are looking for some form of torch-carrying movie, this is not it. If you are looking for a new take, this is it"
1,Green Hornet Dvd will not play.,Dvd does NOT WORK. I sent them an email regarding their return and refund policy. I hope I hear back from them soon...
2,What a disaster,Loved the opening scene and cameo with James Franco but it went all down hill from there. Horrible script and Seth Rogan as the lead. Nuff said. Hopefully he has little clout left to make another disaster like this.
1,An insult to the original,"The most insulting thing about this movie is in the final credits where they claim that it was based on the original radio series. Nothing could be further from the truth. Where the original (radio) green hornet was a mature character with a great deal of depth, this movie was designed for teenage drunks with an attention span no longer than 140 characters.The screenplay is something a hungover slack could have produced after dinner. I could do better in a weekend.None of the characters are true to the original.The origin story is stupid and completely opposite that of the original series.Basically, they took a great old radio series (still available on Radio Classics on Sirius/XM) and dumbed it down to the twitter generation. It is a total failure."
1,buy the comic book insteas,"I read the comics,wantch Van Williams/Bruce Lee but this current GH make the others look like Academy Award contenders. Kata looked liked the leading star and GH looked like a ""what am I supposed to do?"" Sorry Amazon but I ""will not"" buy the DVD.I'll save my money to see how THOR,CAPTAIN AMERICA GREEN LANTERN turn out.I really dont have to much to say GH except UGH........"
1,Not worth it,I'm a really easy person to impress when it comes to movies. I was not impressed by this movie one bit. IT WAS AWFUL!!
4,Funny,"I liked it and thought it was pretty funny. I've never heard of the Green Hornet before so had no expectations before watching. I thought as a comedy, it was good."
4,It Rocks,"The Green Hornet on Blu-Ray is the way to watch this movie.While not boasting the best of scripts,Seth Rogen does a fine job asBritt Reid,who has been put down by his father,James Reid,played by Tom Wilkerson.I recommend watching the movie more than once:each viewing will give the viewer more appreciation &understanding for Britt Reid(aka The Green Hornet)For this movie,Blu-Ray is the best way to go."
1,"Horrible movie, disgrace to original","I cannot think of a word that truly describes exactly how BAD this film is. Seth Rogan adds absolutely NOTHING to this film. The story line is weak. It was like watching a Roger Moore era James Bond film with all the cheesy parts spliced in together.Jay Chou hopefully got his money up front. I wonder if he took this job thinking, ""This will get me good exposure to Hollywood."" He played a decent side kick in Cato.Cameron Diaz, let's face it, was an attempt to have some eye candy to distract you from how bad this film really is. Note to producers, she could have been butt naked and I don't think it would have made a difference.Do yourself a favor, unless you have 2 hours to kill and there is absolutely nothing else to do. Do NOT watch this film."
5,Underrated,"The movie was really funny and interesting. The action was so cool it gave me chills on multiple occasions both times I saw it in theaters. I truly don't understand why it got panned by everybody.If you don't like it, Amazon will refund your money. I guarantee it."
1,Absolute Rubbish!!,This DVD is just an expensive cocktail coaster. This movie is so bad- the Trailer will put you to sleep.........
1,pure crap,"i have been a fan of the green hornet since i was a kid.... the serials and the tv show....when i heard that a big budget film was to be made, i was very exited. i have never been so disapointed in any movie....this was garbage!!!!!"
2,Green Hornet,"Whomever thought that making the Green Hornet a comedy like the ""Pink Panther"" should be fired, kicked, horse whipped, flogged, drawn and quartered, rinse and repeat. Sure I found parts of the movie funny, but if you wanted a comedy call it something else and make it a non descript hero. Taking the good name of a serious crime fighter and making it into this mess just wasn't entertaining and only mildly funny. Kato would have been fine in a serious version, but the Hornet absolutely sucked and I'm not even a fan of the Green Hornet and I'm insulted. One can only hope they remake it like they did the Batmans and take it serious the second time around.CA Luster"
1,Rogen made this movie horrible and unbearable...,"They casted someone good as Kato, but Rogen was a horrible choice. From start to end it was not believable and also seemed like a lame comedy. Would not recommend this movie to anyone by any means."
1,Not worth it,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing the DVD. Honestly, I don't know how bad it actually was. I turned it off less than one minute into it because of the language. I recognize Hollywood's belief that all movies have to have vulgar language to create realism. I don't agree with it, but I do recognize it. The obligatory four letter word seems a must or it can not be a real movie. If I wanted realism, I wouldn't be watching a movie about a comic book super hero. However, the language just in the opening scene is disgusting.One reviewer mentioned 10 year olds. I feel sorry for any parent who took their 10 year old to this and realized after it was too late what kind of language they would have to endure. After about three sentences of dialogue, I turned it off and my wife thanked me.I gave it one star because I could find a way to give it less."
2,not good,"This movie is about a rich boy and is very boring, there are some decent parts but over all i would pass, very boring"
2,This is one of the most embarassingly dumb movies I've seen.,"I quit halfway through. Technically the Blu-ray and 3D are good, but the plot and acting are painful. This one will end up in my Goodwill donations."
2,Very disappointing,If you grew up watching the original Green Hornet this movie will disappoint you very badly. The took the clever witty Brit Reid and made a rich boy idiot out of him. Originally Kato was Reid's trusted friend and ally and their relationship was quite solid. Likewise the D.A. was Reid's ally and friend and together they used the guise of The Green Hornet to confuse and bring to justice many evil and dangerous people. This movie makes you think that if it weren't for Kato nothing would've worked. The two of them going out on some fraternity dare style adventure was frankly sickening. It's quite obvious the no one involved in the making of this movie knew nor cared anything for or about the original story.
1,Bad Bad Bad,The Green Hornet was actually a good TV show. I always thought it would be a good movie some day (with the potential of a Batman franchise). I was disappointed and actually walked out of the theatre in the middle.
2,Pretty Bad,"The stars and writers can't make up their mind whether they want an action flick or a comedy. The end result is neither. This is one of the worst super hero adoptions since the Batman TV series. That show tried to be kamp but fell flat on its face. Ditto with this movie. Seth Regan is at once ugly, awkward and without any true sense of nobility. Well possibly toward the end he becomes a little noble. He does have one distinction-he is the first screen super hero to have some of his back teeth missing. There is nothing else that makes this pic unique. Cameron Diaz does have great legs and Kato is a better character than the Hornet himself. Jay Chou does have potential as an actor even though this movie has no potential."
2,Just plain boring...,"I'm a veteran of Indie/low budget movies and can usually withstand a fair amount of disjointedness and lack-of-direction but I found this movie distressing. The whole thing, while possibly very accurate in detailing the thoughts and feelings of an acutely withdrawn child, left me feeling dead. For the most part it bored me, and I found the acting irritating. I have seen other movies with similar plots (House of cards, Mercury Rising) and while most movies concering disturbed children seemed to be produced by hacks, this has to take the cake. It wasn't even visually interesting, and the only reason I gave it a two was because it has definate potential. It just wasn't developed."
2,I don't think I'd really call this a game...,"Luckily, I had a lot of AmEx reward points that I hadn't been using and essentially got this at no cost. Good thing, because I'm not really all that happy with it. There are no real rules to this ""game"". It's simply trivia questions with bad background music. There are about 300 questions so don't expect this to be a ""game"" you can play too many times before you run out of questions. Since there's really nothing else quite like it for classic rock trivia that I can find I guess it's better than nothing, but it leaves much to be desired. If re-designed and had some real rules to it there's a good chance this could be a good product. In the end, I'm glad I bought it for myself rather than as a gift because I'd be rather embarrassed giving this as a gift to someone given its limitations."
2,Not an interactive kind of game,"Just a lot of questions about rock and roll. No videos or songs playing. It's not like Scene-It, it's like looking at slides on your TV screen and answering questions."
5,A great deal of wisdom for people of all faiths,"Many people choose not to read the books by his Holiness the Dalai Lama because they believe that this will offend or counter their own religious beliefs. Quite to the contrast, everybody can take the simple practices of this book to better their everyday lives.One line in this book has stood out in the my mind. ""You should realize that difficult present circumstances are entirely due to your own past undisciplined actions, so when you experience a difficult period, do you best to avoid behavior that will add to the burden later on."" (p 38). This is just one example of the suggestions given to living a more fulfilling life. I believe that he is right in his suggestion that money and posessions will not make a person happy in life. Each of us must discover what gives meaning to our life. To find this is really not that difficult as His Holiness reveals where it lies.This book is highly recommended for anybody seeking personal and spiritual growth."
3,Not as good as some others,"I seem to be the one dissenting opinion, but I have read almost everything written by and about His Holiness, and this is definitely the one I would recommend last. I felt it lacked the down-to-earth quality that I usually find in his work, that it included a lot of unnecessary detail and that listening to the cd was tedious and lifeless. Experienced practitioners will already be familiar with the information presented here, and those new to Tibetan Buddhism can find much more dynamic and practical presentations than this one (e.g. Awakening the Mind, Lightening the Heart; Path to Tranquility; Ethics for the New MIllenium, etc.)"
4,Audio book edition,"The translator reads this with absolutely no inflection. His mispronounciations and accent are so irritating it's hard to pay attention to the book and the fact that he reads ""How to See Yourself As You Really Are"" keeps me from buying the audiobook, which is a disappointment."
2,How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life,"This book is great, it help people to find inner strength. However, in this busy life. If we can have 30 minutes a day to calm down and reflect out thoughts, our behaviors ,.. then we can also acheiving the happiness to some degrees. I would recommend this book for good reading and thinking. Hard to practice."
2,Hard to understand,I got this book after reading the other reviews and also because i wanted to read about dalai lama but unfortunately this book did not fulfil that purpose.I found it extremly boring and very hard to understand. I was finished reading half of it when i realized that i did not learn a bit about bhddism or leant anything worthy at all.
4,A good handbook to learn more about Buddhism,"Though I learned a lot about the pillars of Buddhism by reading almost the half of the book, it was a bit difficult for me to grasp all philosophical details in this school in the last chapters (or I was not really that much interested to become deep), so I gave it up."
3,How To Practice: The Way to a Meaningful Life,The used book was in excellent condition & was just about right to read.Helped me understand the Dalai Lama more. Kay
4,Dalai should spread his message to corporate America,"What an interesting man. His ascetic lifestyle should be a lesson to all of us in America, that we are over consumers, we over emphasize material wealth and comparing ourselves to others. We are all the same deep in side, and America's greed for money and power is a little bit too much. The Dalai is refreshing."
3,East is East and it's not West,"I have been studying and practicing Buddhism for over 4o years - I still do not understand it. For Non Tibetans (this excludes most Asians too) - forget about tantras and mantras and all the hocus-pocus! We will never be able to understand it. We may imitate it but we will not live it inside out. It will be best to stick to some simple western (rational!) method of meditation and stick to a good, moral life. It IS that simple. No need to look to the Himalayas for enlightenment - it is right inside you.DO not waste time (and life) reading about meditation: Just do it! PRACTICE."
1,Poorly made,The only thing good about these is the price. They are too hot to use in the summer. Do not buy these!!!
2,Light,It lasted a day. I don't think it was made for heavy people. I wore it to work and the cap fell off within an hour.
5,Get the job done,"They are very affordable so the wife got a pair also. We use them for cleaning hardwood floors, gardening, and paint balling. Nice quality for the price, they mean business when they say deluxe."
5,A Mezmorizing Book,"By reincarnating two legendary Persian poets Rumi andHafez in New York Dardedel connects East and West,Past and Present andintegrates science, art and spirituality in a brilliant fashion. Dardedel isvery humorous and insightful."
5,"How to Restore Triumph TR2, TR3 & TR3A",Good book for the restorer of TR cars which my husband is. He liked this gift.
4,Something New,I really enjoyed this new artist. The songs and lyrics were new and refreshing. Some songs on the CD just led me right into worhsip
5,10 Stars,Long awaited. Long overdue. EXCEEDS ALL EXPECTATIONS! A must have in every music collection. A variety of style that never looses the MESSAGE of Jesus Christ! This is one CD purchase you will NOT regret. Buy two: one for your car and one for your home.
5,excelent,"this product its excelent, very soft and fresh, very confortable to the pratice taekwondo, very recomend product to new customer"
3,This is the dirty truth:,"Naveed and Clumsy are quite different CD's. Its kind of like the Evolution of a Band; from Hard Rock to Calmed Down. Rain has definitely taken a more Pop turn on this one, though there are a few very cool songs. His voice is a key part of almost every song. It adds and creates a song like no one else would. One Man Army is definitely the best track on here. And does it ever rock; I can't get enough of it. As for the other traks: They are much calmer, with little or no sign of SuperMan's Death."
4,good release from OLP,"I've been a fan of OLP since Naveed and when i first got this CD i expected a lot more. After listening to it the first time, I only liked one or two songs off of it. I thought that it would just be collecting dust like the rest of my horrible CDs. I decided to give it another chance a few months later. This time I like it a bit more and listened to it again. Now, I can't believe that I ever disliked this CD. While not as good as Naveed, it is still a great CD.The only song I really didn't like was Consequence of Laughing. Thats why it only got 4 stars. The other CDs have no songs that i don't like. Anybody can like this CD if you give it a chance and listen to it a few times. If you like this one, then you should definetly get Clumsy and Naveed. They are also great CDs and are as good as, or even better than Happiness....."
4,Very unique,"This is the type of music that is sometimes hard to find, but once you do, it's definitely worth it. Great melodies, creative lyrics, and you gotta admit, there is plenty of truth in the title.Happiness & the Fish sums up the idea of the CD. Thief is an cynical look at religion and Jesus. And the rythym on Stealing Babies is cool, but I have no idea what it's about. If you like Is Anybody Home, this CD is worth your money."
3,Dissapointed,"After being a OLP fan for years and waiting so anxiously for their 3rd LP , I was basically dissapointed with Happiness... It's a good album, but not a good OLP album. See the difference. They went commercial, what a pitty. There's only one great song on the album, or maybe two. And they would be ""Is Anybody Home?"" and ""Stealing Babies"" The rest of the album is full of ""Carnival""s and ""4 am""s. No sign of any ""Superman's Dead"" or ""Big Dumb Rocket"" kind of thing. And they don't even get close to the perfection they accomplished on ""Car Crash"".A wonderful band, going waste..."
5,totally hooked,"ok so, i really liked this cd at first, and the more i listened to it, the better it got. many, many great songs (i love every one of them) potato girl, happiness, waited, annie, stealing babies are totally awesome tunes. they have a special sound - like something that only i can hear. i can't really explain it. it just speaks to me. it's a tight, kickass cd. I can't stop listening to it!"
5,Our Lady Peace Rocks,"""Happiness...Is Not A Fish That You Can Catch"" by Our Lady Peace is one of my favorite albums of all time. it is simply amazing, i cannot go one day without listening to it at least once. i highly recomend it for anyone who even vaugely considers them selfs a fan of OLP, and it's defanently a must have for the more serious fans like myself. i don't even know how to explain how, or why i love this album so much, except to say that OLP is just one of the best bands i have ever heard. for me stand out tracks on this album are all of them, but to narow it down a little, here are a few realy stand out tracks..... ""Happiness and the Fish"", ""Potato Girl"", ""Blister"", ""Is Anybody Home"", ""Waited"" and especialy ""Thief"", ""Annie"", and ""Stealing Babies"". i know that i have just named almost every song on the album, but mabye i should have, this entire C.D. is amazing ..."
4,"Album has new ""feel"" to it","Way back when, I bought Naveed, and I absolutely loved it. Clumsy kinda disappointed me when it came out because Naveed was so good, although it would later grow on me. Now with Happiness..., I hear the band's evolution and continue to enjoy the music of OLP. Like Starseed and Superman's Dead, One Man Army is the powerhouse behind the album."
3,How to react to a third release!,"Well to put it plainly,people confuse me.Everyone is saying that ""OLP"" has a new sound....what the..?They sound just the way they did on ""Clumsy""except the only difference is sonic elements in Turner's playing!""Naveed"" was their most amazing ,more talent or not..yet this is great..but too much of Raines whining thing and those sonic guitar elements are hard to hear...""Stealing Babies"" is a new ""OLP"" approach, yet them..too many slow songs..and they seem lost yet they don't???The best thing though is ""One man army"" is their best song ever,but if this continues,no more purchases!Too much of a mixed reaction to this one..hopefully the 4th will be amazing(not expectations cuz they are able to be amazing!)the only good record this yr so far!"
5,If you liked the last one you'll love this!!!!!!,The first I heard of Our Lady Peace was 'Clumsy' in 1997. I absolutely fell in love with the intensity of the lyrics combined with the powerful vocal style. This CD packs the same type of punch. Definitely a must have if you liked the last CD.
4,i think i'll go buy it now,"well, raine's voice isn't exactly the most pleasant to listen to, however, after hearing one man army, i figured i'd give the rest of the album a listen, so i d/l the songs and all i can say is WOW....i think i'll go buy it for sure! it's really great, not like their old stuff,(not to say that their old stuff is bad,but u know what i mean) and i think it's almost relaxing to listen to. and if you are not an olp fan now you'll definitely be one after listening to this album."
4,Good CD,"Though it dosen't measure up to there last Happiness... is a great CD for Our Lady Peace. They touch issues like the Columbine expirence in the Song Annie which is the same road Metallica went down with Jeremy. Both of the songs are great. They're first single One Man Army is one of the best songs on the entire CD. Most of the other songs are the kinds I can listen to over and over again. Our Lady Peace is a great band. So if your a long time fan, a brand new fan, or somewhere inbtween the two (Like me) I suggest you get this CD you won't be dissipointed. I kinda just wish there where more songs to listen to!"
1,this kick's buddxbut it isn't as good as their other 14 cd's,this is the best cd i ever heard I really do give it a 1 star(joiqwejgfnldsfngjjkhujgjs) in my foreign land this means THIS KICKS buddox
2,"It really isn't worth it, get the others instead","Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this cd. I was really looking forward to it, but when I got it, wow, I couldn't believe I had spent the money on it. It isn't terrible, I'll give it that, but it is nowhere near the level of greatness that Naveed and Clumsy are. It's got a couple of good songs, but overall, it's a downfall. Hopefully they can regroup with their next release. On a side note, if anyone is going out to see these guys in concert, they play mostly songs from this album, so if you don't like it either, don't expect a great show. I saw them October 1, and of the 10 songs they played, 6 of them were new. and that was when the album had just come out."
2,Our Lady Peace is coming along...but not strong,O.L.P. is just starting out and will be put into the category of one-hit-wonders because of their song One Man Army. You have to give them some credit becasue their CD is some-what good. By N.H.
3,What happened?,"I just got the CD two days ago, and just listening first time through I am not too impressed. ""One Man Army"" and ""Happiness & The Fish"" seem to be the only songs that resemble anything from ""Clumsy"", they're the only one with a driving uptempo beat. ""Is Anybody Home"", ""Consequence of Laughing"", and ""Waited"" I admit are pretty good, but nothing mindblowing. The song ""Annie"" has the feeling of a british pop song, especially the chorus. Otherwise, ""Potato Girl"", ""Blister"", ""Thief"", ""Lying Awake"", and Stealing Babies"", are all very different from anything I've heard from OLP. Where ""Clumsy"" only had 3 slow songs, this has many, which I did not expect from OLP.Well, at least Taggert's drumming is still the best I've ever heard."
4,OLP Continues To Grow,"After Clumsy, I don't see any way that OLP could have gotten any better -- and they didn't. In Happiness..., they continue to explore new musical boundaries and the like -- even featuring drummer extrordinaire Elvin Jones on ""Stealing Babies"", the CD's best song. Overall, still a wonderful album, but it seems to drag a little near the middle. I'm hoping OLP will come out with some new stuff real soon, because they're one of my favorite bands, and one of the best to see perform live. This is a CD well worth your money, and if you buy it at Best Buy you get a 2-CD deal for the regular price. Definitely check this CD out! Other good songs are ""Lying Awake"" and ""One Man Army""."
1,Ear Splitting Nonsense,"Raine...you're cool. Neit. His voice haunts me in my sleep. That whiny, spine-tingling, nerve-damaging, squeal of his sends me to the brink of insanity.Ok, maybe that's pushing it, but how can you listen to him? His lyrics suck...first of all they don't have any meaning to them, and if he says, or you say they do...sorry its just mindless drivel. I'm ashamed to have these no talent #*$-clowns representing Canada as one of our ""premier"" acts... Big Props to the reeeeal Canadian artists.. (Neil, you know, you know). Damn. Get outta here OLP... and take your so called ""alternative"" fans with you. This isn't alternative. (by the way, what do they classify as alternative these days...sounds pretty mainstream to me)."
1,Do not be deceived by the reviews...awful,"This album, consisting of a pathetically tuneless voice and guitar/bass/drums makes this album a very, very poor album. Dull and lacklustre. From the first screeches by Maine Raida you are able to sense that you have just purchased quite possibly the worst album recorded in history. Do not be decieved by all the hype and good reviews surrounding them. When you read the clumsly entitled album, you either think genius or stupidity. Sadly it is a case of the latter.This album is rather painful. DO NOT BE DECIEVED. Go buy a Weezer album and be uplifted."
1,"Apologies to all the fans, I just don't like them at all.","Raine Maida has the most grating singing voice on the planet. He sounds like a washed-up opera diva crossed with a barn owl on acid. All those ""wo wo wo's"" and ""do do do's"" really don't help either. When you add to that the fact that the lyrics sound like they were written in 9th grade (""Please be careful, Annie dreams that everyone is dead"" has to be one of the most lamebrained lyrical punchlines ever written), and that the riffs are always ""emotional"" in the most labored, poseurish, trite, and dumbed-down way, then you slowly begin to realize that this band has no artistic value, are, in fact, worthless, and will ultimately mean nothing over a long period of time. I find their success extremely depressing."
3,I think that new album is not so bad .,I think that new album is not so bad. The music is good but it's look a litle bit to commercial !! Different of the first album... and the style to!!
4,Slowly Changing There Sound Every Album,"This album is a great album if your a music fan, however if you are an Our Lady Peace fan then this album might be somewhat disapponting.There sounds has changed every album and althought this album is good, its missing that power of Naveed and the of great sound of Clumsy. A music fan will love this cd, but an Our Lady Peace fan will love it, but know deep inside of them that when they heard about the new cd they thought it would be better."
4,Happieness...,"Happieness... is a pretty good CD. Yet not as good as clumsy. I was hopping it would be a better follow-up. But hey, it's still great. Is Anybody Home is a major highlite. Also is Happieness And The Fish, Waited, One Man Army, Stealing Babies, and Annie. If you like Our Lady Peace, you should have this."
5,Amazed by the quality,"I got this CD because I enjoyed tracks 1 and 5 on the radio. I discovered that every song is quality. I love every one. With most CDs, I enjoy two or three songs. That is not the case with this one. The key, though, in deciding if you should buy this or not is if you like the vocals. I think he is a great singer. If you don't, I wouldn't buy this CD. I did not think that this CD would be that good; I was wrong."
4,...but the album is pretty catchy,"Hhmm, a peculiar bunch, these guys. This is the first OLP album I've ever bought, persuaded by the distinctive radio song One Man Army. Not bad. The songs are memorable and evocative, enhanced successfully by well-chosen keyboard touches.One Many Army, Happiness & Fish, Blister, and Is Anybody Home? are all excellent. There are two slight drawbacks: the preponderance of midtempo songs, and Raine Maida's stylized singing (blah, blah, falsetto, blah, blah, falsetto, etc) which gets tiring after a while. I wonder if perhaps a couple of good-looking women told him that this kind of singing made him sexy. If not, he probably believes it anyway."
5,Lovely and affordable,"Why pay $150 for a veil from a bridal shop? I can't see much difference between those crazy-expensive veils and this affordable and very pretty one. The edge trim is more noticeable than the photo, in my opinion, but I love it. It feels like it will hold together perfectly, it seems well-made. It only has to last one day anyway, right? I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,D'oh!,"Part of the reason for this low rating is my fault; probably every other bride knows you never buy your veil before your dress, which is what I did. Aside from that, it's okay as veils go. It will make you feel bridal, but it's not very well-made. But it does its job, especially for something that's worn only once. However, I have no complaints about Ginger Wedding; they sent it very promptly and for exactly the price someone should have to pay for this veil."
4,Ice for the home,"The Ice Maker works exactly as described. It is a bulky and takes up a good bit of counter space. You definitely need to run the lemon juice through the machine twice to get the plastic taste out and the machine is a bit loud when it is running. However, my wife was buying ice from Sonic two or three times a week because she didn't like the ice maker in the fridge was a big consideration, The hassle of constantly moving the bag of ice in the freezer to make room for other stuff, as well as not having to stop by Sonic and buy ice, is well worth losing the counter space. My wife loves the small ice the machine makes and declares it to be the best present that I have given her in a while. If the machine was smaller and quieter it would have rated five stars, as it is, it is a very good machine that has worked well since I purchased it at the end of June."
4,Good but act fast,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this bad boy. I have a family of 5 and my refrigerator can't keep up with the ice demands of my family in HOT Florida. This machine got great ratings and was relatively priced. The only problems I have with it is draining the water when not in use...you can't ever get all of the water out so you are forced to have to clean it more than you should. Second- the cubes melt FAST. If you want to use this machine properly, be sure you have a place to store the ice once it's made, do not let it sit in the maker or it melts, if you try to put the ice in the refrigerator's ice maker compartment, the melted ice all bonds together and jams the machine. I empty the ice into ziplock baggies after every release and stick them in the freezer, then slam the bag down once completely frozen and place cubes back the fridge for easy access. Great machien overall, good hearty large cubes"
1,Won't work long,"This ice maker was rated at 5 stars so, we bought two - one for the office and one for home. The one at home worked well for 10 months and then the ice shovel broke. A piece of plastic that conected the shovel to the motor that rotated the shovel broke off. The shovel won't work so, no more ice. The part can not be bought so, as a result I am out the cost of the machine for a cheap piece of plastic. Remember, I said we bought 2 machines. The ice machine at the office made it 6 months before the exact same thing happened. This is the worst investment I have made in a long time. I have read the reviews of the other ice makers and there are others with the same complaint about other brands as well. My advice is don't buy this type of ice maker no matter who makes it."
2,Plastic Internal Parts Break Easily,"This machine seemed like an excellent buy at first. It makes nice soft chewy ice cubes in three selectable sizes. However, the machine broke down within a year. Customer service replaced the parts free of charge the first time, but the machine just broke down again. It's no longer under warranty. So basically, this machine lasted just 16 months.The machine breaks easily because the movable parts, that is, the water tray and its connector to the stepping motor are made out of brittle plastic. The minute a piece of ice gets stuck in such a manner as to prevent the tray from pushing the ice down into the bucket, the motor doesn't sense the problem and continues to push forward until one of these parts cracks.The machine did pay for itself if you count that we use 15 bags of ice a month at 1.50 a bag."
5,Best Ice Maker ever.,"We have had several ice makers over the past few years.They were all inefficent,had mold build-up in them and lasted barely a year,The Suppentown ice maker is terrific in every way.I heartily reccomend it."
1,Don't buy!.,Save your money and don't buy this. I've had two so far and each has stopped working in about a month.
2,Good machine but short life,"The machine worked perfectly for awhile. After 6 months it stopped. Come to find out, the water pump was defective. Unfortunately, the part is not available to purchase, so we had to discard the machine."
2,Beware First Time Owner,"This machine is wonderful, however it took me two machines to find that out. The smell in the machine when you first get it horrible. You absolutely must clean the machine using the cleaning cycle at least 10 times before you use the ice from it. On my first machine I used the cleaning cycle 3 times and still did not get rid of the odor (which permeates your ice, by the way). I finally had to use straight white vinegar in the cleaning cycle to get the odor out. On top of that, I used an air purifier aimed directly into the machine for several hours. That put a high ozone content in there to eat up the chemical odor that is in the plastic. I finally have a machine that works."
1,terrible warranty,"The ice maker produces ice great, but breaks approx every 6 months. The warranty covered the part the first time but when the same part broke the second time 6 months later the manufacturer said the warranty had expired and there was nothing they could do about it. So now I have a $225 water jug. THANKS ALOT SPT!"
2,First one died in 2 weeks. Second one died in 10 months,The one that I purchased for a friend died in 2 weeks and needed repair. The one that I purchased for myself lasted longer but died in 10 months. They leak from the bottom so much that I had to place paper towels underneath to soak up the water. Not a great product in my humble estimation...especially since it was a bit costlier that other similar brands.
5,Life Saver for cold beverages.,"I live in a rural S.E. US area where the ground water is not up to par as far as taste is concerned, even with filtration and water softening. The ice cubes carry the bad taste into your beverages. When this little gem arrived I plugged it in, loaded the water reservoir with distilled water, and within minutes I was enjoying beautiful ice in my cold drink. I have been buying large bags of ice from in town and now I no longer have to make that long journey into town for ice. Great ice maker for the money."
2,Doesn't work long,Had this ice maker for only 3 months and it stopped working. The warranty is supposed to be for a year but you have to pay for the shipping to send it in for repairs. They sent instructions to check the motor however the diagrams don't match the product we have. Also the warranty says it is not valid if repaired by unauthorized person. So does the warranty not apply if we start taking it apart as their instructions say. Would not recommend this product. Expected it to last at least through the warranty period if not longer.
4,Party of 20 in 90 Degree Heat and Worked Wonderfully,"I bought this to use in my garden party patio and NOT indoors. The insulation helps this perform in heat where others that are not insulated fail. The large ice cubes are really large compared to another brand I purchased before. I highly recommend. I gave it 4 stars because it has 3 design improvements or flaws. Having owned a restaurant in the US and understanding the food hazard and safety precautions for ice...it needs some improvements. One, having to remove the ice basket with your hands to refill...if instead it had a little tube and spout to pour into...that would eliminate the hand carried bacteria hazard. Next, a slot or notch that the ice scoop could fasten to to keep the handle from falling over into the ice thus contaminating it. Last, the lid should lift backward just 2 degrees more to prevent it from wanting to ""fall down"" while you are in the middle of scooping ice. Otherwise...a 5 star product."
4,Clean it 1st!!!,It works like a champ. Just make sure you clean it with bleach water before you use it. We filled it up and started making ice right away but the ice smelt and tasted bad. After a thorough water and bleach solution douching everything is great!!!!! ENJOY.
2,Don't Waste Your Time Unless...,"Basically, it shows you a lot of cheap tricks that you yourself could have figured out. However, if you are starting out and looking for a couple good tricks it might not be sooo bad. How about this for short, a magician probably wouldn't buy this book."
2,Not for Serious Magicians,"This book does have some good tricks, but not really for serious magicians. You may go in for other titles like Royal Road to Card Magic, or Expert Card Technique, if you want to learn something worthy."
2,could be better,"this toy is a nice concept... that needs a lot of work. I bought it for my newly 4 year son. unless you write the letters perfectly the toy was unable to recognize them. when my son try to write slowly then the toy did not wait for him to finish his writting, the toy would try to guess the letter. No matter how hard he tried, the toy either got the letter wrong or did not let him finish. The toy concept is great but it needs a lot of work as no parent will buy this toy if their kids know how to form their letters already. it works best if you know how to form your letters already then what's the point??? This is a very frustrating toy for the little one who is learning to write their letters and doesn't have a handle on them yet."
2,Not worth the money,"The ""smart writer"" doesn't work well. Even when I try and write letters, it often doesn't recognize the letter (and my handwriting isn't that bad!)."
2,Don't waste your money,"We just bought this for our three year old son. He knows his letters very well and can read a little too. So we hoped that this would encourage him to develop his writing ability. The problem is when he writes the letter his way the machine will not accept it. This is discouraging and he tends to ask me or his father to write the letters. Sometimes we can't even get an approval on the letter!? As a result he tends to play the other little games such as ""missing letter"" or pressing the animals on the smart board. The animals on the smartboard serve no purpose really. The funny pages that come with the machine are a waste. These are just photocopy quality coloring pages with the each letter of the alphabet printed on. These tend to get crinkled and torn in a couple of uses. If this toy was priced $20 lower it would be fine, but for this price, V- tech should do better."
2,Not a Good Toy For Learning to Write Letters,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old who was already writing her letters pretty well. This toy is awful for recognizing letters and would even tell me I was incorrect when I wrote one perfectly. It only frustrates my daughter and makes her feel like she didn't do a good job. On the other hand, she enjoys playing the games on it. I won't even save this toy for my second child and wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Not all impressed but not bad,"My 5 year old son is getting really good at writing letters, so he recieved this as a gift. I like the way it sounds and how clear it is. However, If the child doesn't write straight on it or it is a little uneven, the machine tells him that it isn't right. It is a good thing that my son knows he is right, and I tell him the machine is pretty picky!"
2,Does not recognize letters,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter, hoping that this would help her with learing how to write her ABC's. It does seem to show you how to write letters, but unless you put enough pressure with the stylus AND write the letters EXACTLY the computer will not recognize them. My daughter was really excited when she got it....but is now pure frustration because she cannot write the letter exactly. Very dissappointed with this toy!"
2,Do Not Buy!,I bought this for my 4 year old son who took an interest in learning to write some letters. It wouldn't receognoze the letters he wrote no matter how careful he wrote them. What a huge waste of money and I'm very disappointed. The games are difficult and do not give the preschooler enough time to solve them. For $35 it should be much better. He was happier with some lined paper and a pencil!
2,I hope your child writes perfectly!,"I bought this thinking it would help my 4 yr old learn to write. It gives great instructions on how to write the letter, I will say that. However, unless your child writes PERFECTLY, it won't say they wrote the letter. I myself wrote letters and numbers with it, only to be told ""good try."" It is more frustrating to my daughter than anything else. If I had tried it before I bought it, I never would have made the purchase."
3,I believe this toy is defective,"When I first saw the advertisement for this toy I felt as thought it would be great for my six year old son. Although he does have some special needs, he does know his alphabets and hecan also read. His problem is: I cannot get him to write. Im school his teacher has started him out with easy letters such as L's,T's and F's which seems to be working but when I purchased the write and learn smartboard he seemed to love it! not just the writing but all of the other game functions. The problem iswhen you keep writing on the screen after a while it seems to crack and the smartboard no longer works. This is the second one that I have purchased since Christmas. It is a great concept but it still needs some work."
1,Very Frustrating toy,"My son's grandmother got him this toy after he wanted it SO bad after seeing it on tv last year. He was so excited but after a few days of the toy constantly telling him his letters were wrong (though he was writing them fine, like a 5 year old) he just couldn't handle the toy anymore and resorted to coloring on it and wasting the paper. Now its in the trash as it was also not very durable.Many other better toys out there for learning."
2,Great idea... but...,"In concept, the Write'n Learn Smartboard is brilliant; the user gets real time feedback whenever he completes the letter or task. In reality, however, the system demands that letters be printed 'just right' and doesn't allow any room for the half scribbled un-eveness that the average 4-5 year old produces. For that matter, I'm almost 40 yrs old and it took me 3 try's to write a 'B' that the system would accept. As my sons writing becomes more refined, I can definitely see this being helpful.. but for now, we stick with the games."
3,Cute but could be better,"I bought this for my 4 year old son who has problems writing. It will be great for letter recognition but there is only one sheet per letter provided. My son needs to see what he writing on paper. The screen at the top doesn't give a great idea of what he is trying to do. Also, my older son got frustrated because he was writing the letter correctly but the computer wasn't able to pick it up. I am a bit disappointed since I had heard good things about this toy. Vtech should provide more ways for the child to see the letter they are trying to write. Also, if they added letter sounds to this it would be great."
2,smartboard isn't so smart,I was so excited to buy this for my almost 5 yr old son. It has been such a disappointment and a frustrating toy for both of us. If you don't write the letter correctly it doesn't recognize it. How do you explain to a little one who is trying so hard when the toy keeps telling him he is wrong? I would not recommend this toy and am very disappointed that I purchased it.
5,This is the toy to have,"I have 2-year-old genious twins and a 3-year-old. Well I have about 10 different electronic toys similar to this one, and this one is the best for their current abilities. Ok, it doesn't always guess the letters, but so what, it just says keep practicing. It also has numerous other features. This is the toy to have if you have a genious 2-year old like mine. He picks this thing up at 8:00am and plays with it till he goes to sleep at 8:00 pm. He has been doing this since he got it 3 weeks ago. And he has so many toys that for Christmas his relatives sent him toys he already has. The other siblings play with it as well, just not as much. I bought two so they wouldn't fight over it. I love this thing."
5,Great Toy,We got this for our daughter for Christmas. She is 4 years old. And loves it. It really helps with them learning how to write their name. She practices on it everyday. We are very big on learning toys. And this is one of the good ones we find. Our two year old even plays with it. I would recommend it. It tells them when they have wrote there name correct. and then when they need to practice more.
3,Perfect for my 6 year old!,"I purchased this toy for my 6 year old kindergartener and it's great! He knows how to form his letters and is on the brink of learning to read complex sentences fluently. He is in the phase of writing, drawing, coloring, overall expressing his interests in print. This toy is a MUST HAVE in our house. Saves alot of paper and great for travel too!"
3,Where's the magic?,"To have heard Emma at the Halekulani Hotel on a balmy evening in a room open to the sea as a full moon rose over Waikiki was a magical experience. I was hoping for that magic here. Unfortunately, these selections do not capture that magic. Emma has a rich, glorious voice which is not presented as well here as in her albums when Jack De Mello was the producer and conductor. The title of the album is misleading in that six of the twelve selections are not recorded live at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel but are, in fact, studio recordings. Any true fan of Emma will want this album for their collection but should be aware that the album titled ""Jack De Mello presents The Best of Emma"" is far superior to this one. The producer here did not do justice to the artist and that is sad. Emma deserves better."
3,Wrong Part,This Metra 70-55270AV Factory DVD Retention Harness for Select 2002-2004 Ford Vehicles was the wrong part for my applicaton but nice product. Im sure it would work great in correct application. WILL NOT FIT 2004 EXPEDIION WITH FACTORY NAVIGATION
2,Mini Dictionary,"It serves as a mini-dictionary for the terms used, but offers no real insight. If you need a definition of a term, use the internet."
5,Great book!,This book has been a great help for me and my family and for me as a teacher! I had one before for many years but sadly it got lost so I needed to buy another one.I give it my full recommendation.
1,HORRIBLE,"All though I wasn't crazy about the author first novel, it was o.k..I was thinking that her writing skills will get better over time. But the last two books got worse. Her writing stayed the same, the author just changed the main characters. The storyline was about the same, all the way down to the same words used in the love scences. I to support AA authors, granted some are better than other, but I will still hang in there and buy books even if I don't think the author is that good of a story teller, BUT Mrs. Lee is a different story. I won't give up on her yet, but I'll just check her future books out at the library, so I won't feel like I wasted my money by buying her books."
3,What Goes Around Comes Around...,"Arnelle and Winston keep running into each other - not by choice - but by their friends Venice and Craig. Arnelle and Winston can't stand one another, but on each meeting occasion, their hostility toward each other turns into an attraction that grows stronger.I find Darrien Lee's novels (I've also read All that and A Bag of Chips some time ago) to be easy reading - sometimes too easy. You're able to predict what will happen in each scene, all the way down to the ending.It's evident Darrien Lee can write, but I would like to see more creativeness. Overall, What Goes Around Comes around, to me, was very simple, which isn't necessarily bad, it just doesn't leave you breathless or wanting more. It just leaves you.Rolanda,Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"
3,We've seen this before,"This your typical love story about a dude named Winston and a woman named Arnelle that find they are a perfefct match for each other. Winston decides to turn in his players card after getting with Arnelle. But a secret from the past tries to break up their future together and they have to see if their love is strong enough to survive the rough past.I really didn't think this book was all that good it was a bit boring at times. You know what's going to happen in the end and I had problems with some of the dialogues because they were too simple. Every character seemed to get along with each other oh too well. It was like the book was set in a utopia setting. There was not enough drama, not enough twists and not enough excitement. But maybe I'm biased because I've read so many books, but I didn't think it was all that great."
2,Average and predictable story,"Having read Ms. Lee's first two novels, I had hopes that this book would be more mature in writing style than the others, but nothing has changed. This book, and its other prequels, belong in a teeny-bopper's book club instead of being marketed to a mature audience. As I read, I could easily predict the story: boy meets girl/boy falls for girl/boy loses girl/boy forgives girl/boy and girl live happily ever after. Typical fairytale. No new ideas here. Just something to read if you have nothing else to do, or you are not in the mood for a book that challenges your imagination."
5,"I bought this cd on a whim, and wow!!!","I bought this cd after buying a couple Bruce/Charlie Robison cds and hearing that I might also like Jack Ingram. I am so glad that I decided to take my firend's advice and buy this cd. Jack Ingram is not only a great songwriter, he also has a really awesome voice. I would love to hear him play live. This cd is probably not for those that tend to enjoy the over-produced, generic (crappy) music that is too often played on country radio."
5,Jack is Back!,This is a GREAT CD! I have all his CDs and this is my new favorite. It's got the perfect mix of music and the writing is as clever as always. He's come a long way from playing at Cain & Abel's in Austin and we miss seeing him all the time!
4,Something new form Pratchett,"Watch out world the Nome's are coming! Being evicted from their home beneath the floors of an old department store, the clueless Nome's must follow an ""outsider"" out into the mythical outdoors! Older children should be encouraged to read all these books. If you pre teen likes video or gaming fantasy. If you can actually get them to read the first one, he or she will be hooked on quality material!!"
3,Pity about the colour,"Not a bad watch but not great either. The watch shipped with a dead battery, however that was an easy fix. The band feels thin and cheap and was an unattractive colour. It did take dye well though. It is worth it if you don't mind doing a bit of work to it or if you like yellow watches."
5,Just another girl.,I think ever young girl should see this movie because i think it teackes a lesson to young girls to not grown up fast and to what there turn and I love the movie and i think it teaches a very good lesson. Thank You
2,Just a bad movie,"I thought this movie was completely ridiculous and poorly acted. If I was from Brooklyn, I would be seriously upset at the portrayals in this film."
3,Kind of movie that makes you think,"This movie is real, because I know so many smart young women who make the mistake of getting pregnant and then trying to figure out what to do. The choices this young lady made were heart wrentching. It pretty much shows how one misguided choice can affect the rest of your life.I think if you are a parent, you should watch this movie with your teenager, and have a serious talk about SEX....not the birds and the bees but SEX."
5,Very realistic account of so many young women,I am in total agreement with Kimberly Dees. This true to life account of horrifying events should be used as an educational tool for young men and women around this country--from black and white ghettos to black and white affluent neighborhoods--this is an excellent warning for today's youth and it should be seen by all who are in that stage where they are young and immature but believe they are wiser than the surrounding adults. Highly recommended.
4,A lesson here,"Ah Yo, what tha deal. This movie is very good, old (very early 90's) and outta style but good. It teaches young girls, such as myself, not to be fast. aight ya'll, one."
4,Excellent,"Every teenager should see this movie and every parent with teens should make sure they see this movie with thier teen, about how a decision you are not sure of can change your life forever. It shows how important good communication is inperitive between parents and children."
3,The Movie was okay,"The movie was about a young high school girl in the projects, with aspirations of going to medical shool and becoming a doctor. She meets a young man..and you can figure out the rest. She gets pregnant.The movie had several unknown actors. For what it was, the movie was okay..but the soundtrack was great!!!The sad part is that you can't purchase the soundtrack to the movie."
3,Eh...,"Well, I'm not a big fan of old British plays, but this one was eh, okay. Had it's somewhat funny moments that people could kind of relate to in the present time, but unless you really enjoy old jokes and hard to understand jargon, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this book. Unless you have to for a class. Which is why I bought it. Otherwise I would have never given this book a second glance."
1,Is this supposed to be funny?,"I have to read She Stoops to Conquer for school and it is absolutly terrible. For a play that is supposed to be funny and one of the most comical plays of its time, I find it completly boring. I am not discriminating against the ""classics"", as I have read many which I have highly enjoyed, but reading this play is a waste of time."
2,length is false,"I bought several moister meters. I bought this one because the description stated it was 13 some inches. I wanted to check the moister level in my taller pots. I receive this meter and what do you think? Yes. They fooled me. The overall length is 10 1/4 inches. and the stem only measures 7 inches. This one is the shortest one, when I thought it would be the longest one. FOOL ME ONCE; SHAME ON YOU. FOOL ME TWICE; SHAME ON ME."
4,cheap and seems to work,"probably much cheaper at your garden store, but that's inbuilt prime pricing for you. for shipping to my remote area that's still a bargain to me.bought this and a completely different cheap model (square-ish-shaped, I'm sure you can find it), to see if I've been overwatering. apparently I have. surprise. anyway both meters give more or less agree on the reading in every plant I've tested, so maybe that's something.not sure if it's better to just leave it in the last pot tested, or remove+clean every time etc."
4,Helpful Item works well,"I've had this meter for about a year and it's still working well. I use it for our vegetable garden so I don't overwater. Often the soil surface will look dry, but just below the surface, about 3 or 4"" down it's plenty moist, so this meter keeps me from over wetting the veggies and causing fungal problems.I recommend it."
4,Soil Meter,Excellent product that is functional. The documentation describing what types of plants need what levels of moisture could be more extensive.
4,I love the way it looks!,This is so pretty I had to write a review to offer some advice. We were putting up the first piece and it wasn't sticking well I was getting discouraged. My husband had an idea to use a hard plastic frosting spreader from cakes and it worked great. After that it was a snap But I suppose any hard plastic would work just as well. We also used one of those laser lines to keep it straight. It came out fantastic and is so pretty!
5,Room Completed!,"Although a bit pricy, this border looks gorgeous up! We painted the room half yellow & half purple & put the border in the center. It looks fabulous! We used 2 large pieces & you can not see the seems. It went up very easily. It was my husbands first time putting border up & he is now willing to do it again if need be:) I do have a lot of left over, but if you want the room to match I guess you must be willing to pay for it!"
3,"Looks good, needs improvemnet","We also have this theme for our baby's room and the border is a nice touch... It doesn't stick on very well but with some patience and added on pressure when putting it up it and alittle help from some glue overall looks great... I would still have bought this knowing what I know now, just don't expect the best! Perhaps the compnay will improve the product."
2,"Cute, but not worth it","This border is adorable now that we finally have it up. We had problems with the edges sticking and had to purchase a separate adhesive to get it to really stick to the walls. This is not the first time my husband and I have hung a wall border, so I can be fairly confident in saying that for some reason, this border was particularly frustrating. I would probably have forgone the border altogether had I known how difficult it was going to be to hang. If you do purchase it, good luck! 2 Stars are strictly on cuteness!"
1,Don't waste your money - others saved theirs!,"I met and spent time personally with the author, Patrick Avon. He is full of himself, and though this book may offer SOME helpful hints, it does little for anyone - that's why it has not sold well. I bought the book as a good will gesture to see if he had anything good to present and was disappointed by the presentation and content. Not recommended."
2,Weak,This book is not worth the money. If you would just stick to running and lots of calisthenics you would be bgetter off.
4,Like the layout,This is my second one. I lost the first one! So I must like it enough to get another one. Some people may be disappointed that there is not more on the formulas. That is not an issue for me. I am needing the meat of the info so I can memorize a cheat sheet that I can write down on the paper they provide when I get to the testing desk. There is probably no study aid that could help me remember the formuals. I take the PMP test 10/28/12
3,PMP Project Management Knowledge Areas & Processes,"Product has all the information from PMBOK Third Edition as described. Printing is very small, however, and might be hard to read for many people. Card could very well be made bigger and just have additional folds. Am anticipating the next version that reflects the Fourth Edition."
5,"Ravensong is back, thank heavens!","One of the best integrated treatments of Nature, Catherine Feher-Elston's Ravensong: A Natural and Fabulous History of Ravens and Crows,is at last available to a greater public through Trcher/Penguin. This lyrical treatment of ravens, crows and their relationships with people and other animals is fascinating and beautiful. Anyone who reads this work will never look a crows and ravens in exactly the same way again. This is a great book, and anyone with a love of birds, animals, science, literature of mythology will enjoy it."
1,Skip this one,"I really wanted to like this one. But I also needed it to be either more literary or more anthropological. The illustrations and page design are beautiful. But Feher-Elston's text is annoyingly repetitive, with even less actual information than you might expect from a large-type book. Where I was hoping for well-retold stories about Raven/Crow, she gives a few, not particularly imaginative synopses. Where she might have focused on Native American myths (her strong point, if she has one), she throws in psuedo-information about Raven in other cultures, without really giving you any stories. Where you really want her to just tell the Raven story, she throws in Native American history with only a tangential relationship to Raven/Crow. Aaaargh. I can and have read Original Peoples history elsewhere. I can and have read anthropological accounts of shamans elsewhere. It's called Ravensong. Wouldn't it be nice if it collected songs about ravens?"
2,It's nice for the fans,"It's a nice cd but certainly not her best. If you already have everything about Tina Turner, then this is a nice option. Best of this cd is: The Woman I'm Supposed To Be."
4,A Wonderful Commentary,"The Revelation of Jesus ChristRevelation of Jesus Christ: A Commentary on the Book of RevelationI had never heard of this commentary by J.B. Smith. My friend John loaned me his copy. As I read this book I was struck by the care and research Dr. Smith gives to Revelation. He presented ideas that was worth considering from his study. Though I do not agree with all his conclusions, his comments stimulated my thinking on this very important prophecy. This was helpful for my own study because it gave me new areas to explore."
2,I didn't think it was possible to be more confused than before,"This book is massive and confusing. I thought it would give some step by step insight into the adoption process but was disappointed. I also felt left out by the types of adoptive groups it described...We happen to be a financially stable young married couple that CHOOSES to adopt, not infertile. I felt like I was in some unheard-of catagory...anyway..don't know whether to invest in a different book or what at this point"
4,Quite good!,I found this book very useful since I am too thinking about adopting. I do feel there is much more to be found in [...] site. But I do recommend it!
4,A must read for people who are interested in adoption!,This book is a must read it is truly original and tells us the adoption process it breaks into chapters and assists us the readers in getting the stuff we needed. This guide will assist your adoption quest go easily!After several readings I became attach to this book it is a better resource books on adoption that I've study to date.It was especially useful for us simply because we're considering adopting an older person.This is really an extremely nicely written guide on adoption. I would recommend this book in a heart beat!
3,Great Book...more for Babies adoptions though,"Loved the inforamtion. The book spends most of its pages on baby adoptions out of the country, as opposed to in state adotpions as I was hoping. This book does provide information on each states procedures and processes. I'm not sorry I got the book, it will be a useful tool through our state adoption process."
4,"A FAIRLY ""COMPLETE"" GUIDE TO ADOPTION","A GOOD BOOK FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DECIDED TO ADOPT A CHILD BUT ARE OVERWHELMED BY ALL THE CHOICES. A CLEAR, CONCISE GUIDE WHICH OBJECTIVELY RELATES THE PROS AND CONS OF ALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE. COVERS SUBJECTS SUCH AS FINDING A BIRTH MOTHER, MEETING A BIRTH MOTHER, BIRTH FATHERS AND THEIR RIGHTS, OPEN ADOPTION, THE HOME STUDY (NOT A VERY THROUGH CHAPTER-JUST A GENERAL OVERVIEW, ADOPTION EXPENSES. THE AUTHOR ADDRESSED MEDICAL CONCERS SUCH AS DRUG, ALCOHOL, AND TOBBACCO USE BY THE BIRTH MOTHER. THE BOOK ALSO COVERED SOME LEGAL ISSUES AND GAVE TIPS ON CHOOSING AN ATTORNEY OR AGENCY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IN DEPTH INFO ON HOW TO FIND A BIRTH MOTHER OR IN DEPTH INFO ON THE HOMESTUDY, HOW TO TALK TO A BIRTHMOTHER, HOW TO EVALUATE A BIRTHMOTHER'S SINCERITY, OR HOW TO RAISE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE ADOPTION ITSELF THEN YOU WILL NEED TO BUY A DIFFERENT BOOK. OVERALL THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK IN RELATION TO OTHER BOOKS THAT CLAIM TO BE ""COMPLETE""."
5,I recommend this book to all my adoption clients !,"I am in the adoption field. I have helped to facilitate over 30 adoptions in the past 18 months. Laura's book is a must read for each of my clients wishing to adopt.The section in the back, will give you valuable information if you are Prospective Adoptive Parents networking to find a Birthmother and need brief information on states laws.Thank you Laura for helping us understand the steps toward having a successful adoption journey!!If you are just begining to learn more about the adoption journey...read this book...and use Laura's helpful hints....and may your journey be successful.I did, and have two beautiful daughters, Nicole,age 8 & Taylor, age 7months to prove her methods work!!A Miller"
1,Highly slanted and deceptive,I rented this video looking for an interesting intelligent dialogue. As a Non Mormon I was looking for some insights. Instead this was a highly contrived discussion with an axe to grind against Mormons. This was uninteresting and in annoying(I hate films that try to manipulate). All this film does is assure people who don't agree with Mormons that they are right and try to tell current Mormons that they are wrong. It seems like a waste of money to pay for such an obvious and tired dialogue.
3,OK video but not worth full price,"I thought the video was boring but my son (2 1/2 years old) sat and watched it. It says a letter name, sound and words that use the letter. It will even spell the words for you. I thought the color portion was very poor. I did enjoy the shape portion of the video. I would purchase it again at a discount price."
5,A Wonderful Children's Book You Should Not Miss Out On,"When I was younger, I watched a movie created by BBC titled ""Tom's Midnight Garden"". The movie was wonderful and mystical and years later, I found the book and decided to buy it. I was NOT disappointed. This book is incredibly amazing for a children's book, and deals with the fact that dimensions and time can overlap. I would definitely recommend that you read this to your children, or even to yourself. Definitely read this one!"
4,Still charming,"Ah, rereading this book took me back. It really has everything a child could want from a story - sympathetic characters, some sentiment, some action, and an excellent ending. Incidentally, BBC television did a very good dramatisation of this in the 1970s. I'm sure today's children wouldn't mind a repeat."
4,A journey that takes you back and forth through time.,"What a wonderful journey into a boy's dreamlife.The mystery of nightlife is opened in this beautifully written piece. Yet, the intrigue and magic of ""sleep-travel"" remains a wonder until the very last word.Each night we are explorers of a new frontier when we fall into sleep. Philippa Pearce opens the door this unknown and undiscovered realm---""sleep and dream"" and the world inside.This journey is a seductive invitation to live your sleeping hours."
3,"A classic, but it seems rather dated now.","I read this book as a child and remembered it fondly, but in little detail. Reading it aloud now to my six year old son several things strike me. Firstly, it's not as magical as I remember, which is surprising. Secondly, the sense of place is very well evoked and I'm ashamed that I did not remember its Fenland setting. Thirdly, Time - the subject of the novel - has not been kind to it. It was first published in 1958 and the present-day scenes have a contemporary feel to them. In other words, it seems dated, but the late 1950s, which were a very repressive period in recent English history, have yet to acquire the kind of nostalgic charm that attaches to, say, Arthur Ransome's books which were mostly written and set in the 1930s."
3,Eighth Grade Critics,The book did not interest us. It was well written but if you are not into adventure this book is for you. A boy goes back in time into a garden and meets some people. That is what the entire book is about and after awhile it gets boring
2,"Too Much Description, Not Enough Story","Well, this book was not too good. The author kept telling how great everything was and then just took the story and ran it in circles. Tom just did the same thing (basicly) every night, just with new elements. The only good part is the ending. Recommended to anyone who has a lot of time."
5,Doesn't get better than this,"I HATE IT TOO is the best song you've never heard. This band should be all over the radio, but I rarely do hear them."
5,No respect!,"Why in the world Hum isn't one of the most decorated bands on the planet, I'll never know. Hum embodies everything good about rock music. While everyone else is out recording ""crap"" Hum manages to put thought into every measure of every song...and it shows! I appreciate bands like Hum, because if it weren't for them...music would truly be dead to me."
5,mind-boggling,"OH MY GOD! This is without a doubt some of the best rock to grace the ears of listeners since music was thought of. Truely reflects the current standing in music progression. Packed full of emotion and overwhelming lyrics Hum throws down a bullseye for all listeners, truely a must have for all intelligent listers. Please,please,please buy this album,money is not even relavent to the pure experiance that is hum."
5,Music to live life by.,"You've read the other reviews, it's not a coincedence that everyone calls this amazing, otherworldly, whatever. Find a comfy spot on the couch, close your eyes, listen to this music, and clear your mind. I'd consider this the ultimate chill-out CD, driving at night CD, reading during a stormy day CD, and just about everything else. My words aren't enough to describe it, just buy the CD, you won't regret it."
4,My feelings are typical,"Basically, there's not a lot to say about this album that hasn't been said. The music is spacey, soaring, and mesmerizing, and ""Stars"" is one of the best songs ever written. This is music to think to, music to drive to at night, music to make you feel things beyond words. Some major flaws are present here, however. For one, the album only has 9 songs, although many of them are very long. The recording quality could be better... the album sounds too quiet, and that takes lots of the punch away. A band this good deserves better production. It particularly hurts the softer parts, which can barely be heard even at high volumes. Also, ""Stars"" is just such an amazing song that the rest of the album looks weaker in comparison. Other stand out tracks include ""I Like Your Hair Long"" and ""I Hate It Too"". Despite the negatives, this is one of the best indie rock type albums ever made, and every music fan needs it."
3,Must-own album!,"Hum is what happens when emo meets grunge and makes friends with an astrophysicist. Creative if whimsical lyrics, heavy yet light guitars - A relaxing musical experience that you can still turn up and rock out with! Hum (from Champaigne, IL) were definitely ahead of their time with the space-emo theme, inspiring myriad midwest indie rockers like The Stella Link, Traindodge, Dirt Nap and many others. This album presents several great songs in a witty lo-fi package. If you like Radiohead and The Flaming Lips, this album is a must-own!"
4,Good to great album,"Don't confuse my use of the word ""album"" to mean I am old. I bought this CD because I was stationed in the military overseas at the time and this was one of the few CD's that were offered that was different than the buble gum pop that fills our stores. The band is quite good and the songs are very catchy. Dreamy in some places and very hard in other songs. The songs ""Little Dipper"" and ""the very old man"" are excellent and should be up there with any great band. This album is a must buy and an excellent listen when driving. A good mellow/hard heavy type album if there is such a thing. Run out and get it. Why no 5 stars? 1 oe 2 songs kinda stink."
4,A Good help in the history of the R+C,"Discussing the value of this book we must compare it to some other classics.The first is MacIntosh's Rosicrucians which iis the ""must"" and the first that one must have red in order to know the basic of the movement.Second is the literary history (as a non adept historian) of the R+C movement given by Frances Yeats in her ""Rosicrucian Enlightment"".Wittemans book contains review of bibliography difficult to find today like the book of Sedir on the Rosicrucians and many books that had reviewed in order to write his own account. It gives many informations where the others stop. but is not the first book to get in touch with the R+C movement since there is McIntosh book."
5,Best on the Market!,"This is the third vacuum we've bought in the last 4 years, and we finally found a winner! With 4 dogs, constant teenager traffic in and out and a combination of hardwood and tile floors and carpeted areas, this vacuum excels at everything. It has tremendous suction, it's lightweight and has attachments for every need. You can't go wrong with this vacuum."
4,Great product,"This vacuum is great! Would highly recommend it. Usually get a Hoover, but couldn't find any I liked at this time. Friends and family recommended the Electrolux."
1,I hope this is better than the previous model,"I actually bought an EL7001. A 2-cent clip that joins the power head to the wand broke off, and we tried an Electrolux store for repairs. They told us ""Oh, we don't handle those--they're made by Eureka. If you want a REAL Electrolux, bring it in for a trade-in."" Now, would you buy anything from idiots like that?? The vacuum is now worthless, because the power head won't stay on. One star is more than they're worth."
2,Poor Design,"The suction on this machine seems like it should be up to par, but the design of the attachments leaves an air gap between the wand and the attachments so that the only way to get 100% suction out of them is to tape around the exposed gap. At the list price, you should not have to do anything to it!! The beater bar attachment does not have this problem and seems to work fine."
1,Poor/Cheap Construction,"Powerhead spinning brush wore out within 3 months, due to construction made of plastic parts, where metal parts should have been. If you buy this vacuum, expect lots of regular repairs. Even the Electrolux repair facilities who repaired it acknowledged this was a piece of crap."
4,great vac but wire short issue,"I purchased this vac from QVC about 2 years ago, I noticed in last 2-3 months that power carpet nozzle was ""cutting out"" on power when dragging around. I took off extensions and touched the 2 wire prongs that connect for power (to main unit) and found that one was discolored and HOT so I disconnected another extension in center and it was hot too. We took it to local ""vac clinic"" in Lexington and found that we had to order 2 more extensions, there was a short in the wire and would have soon burnt up. My Mom bought the same vac about same time from Q and had same issue. My point is to BE CAREFUL, if this starts shorting out, get parts replaced, it cost us about $40 total to have repaired. I do love the vacuum though, it does a terrific job, I have 2 small mini schnauzers that drag in alot of leaves, etc and it does a great job."
1,A great vacuum....on rare occasions when it works,"Bought this vacuum in 2010 from Amazon, based on high rating in Consumer Reports. At first I loved it -- it is lightweight and has excellent suction. Unfortunately the functional parts are made of cheap plastic and they break - ALOT. The cheap plastic clamp that connects the powerhead to the wand breaks constantly, rendering the powerhead useless (I can only vacuum bare floors now - not carpet). Having now read user reviews on several websites, this is an incredibly common problem with this vacuum. Also the plastic release pedal breaks. Repairs not terribly expensive, but they are constant. Done with this vacuum."
1,What Vacuum not to buy,We purchased this vacuum and have had problems with it all the time. You would think this company would have tested it but I guess not. For me one the biggest problem is the hose coming out the canister is kinked all the time. There is no way to fix it except to make sure it is not kinked while you use it. That is difficult. I just can't see spending this much money and not getting a really good vacuum. A lot of the other people that have complaints about this vacuum are correct. Do not buy this vacuum. It is too expensive for what you get.
1,not your mom's electolux,This is vacuum is pure junk. After only 5 months of light use the attachment to the motorized brush just fell apart. This is a common problem with this vacuum. There is no quality here that you would expect from Electrolux. Research reveals that it is made by Eureka. The use of the Electrolux name is just pure deception to capitalize on the Electrolux name. When I took the vacuum in for repair you should see all the Electrolux Oxygen models lined up for repairs. Take a look at [...] for similar complaints DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.
2,Find another vacuum,I purchased this vacuum based on the strong review it received from Consumer Reports. I should have known better. Consumer Reports is too PC. Consumer Reports seems to have missed the reliability issue with this vacuum. I would not recommend it.
1,"It sucks, and not in a good way","I've had this vacuum for about 6 months, and have used it about once a week. Small home, just two of us. The vacuum keeps tripping itself off, and on this last occasion, it appears I can't get it to reset. Headed off to the repair shop now."
2,"Poorly designed, over-priced junk","Hose is extremely flimsy--when you try to pull the canister around, the hose always kinks at the base where it attaches to the vacuum. There's extra hose support where it attaches to the wand, but not at the base. This does not make any sense.The bags are very small. This is especially useless if you have a dog.You can not lay the wand flat in order to vacuum under tables, sofas, beds etc... The wand has a large, awkward lever near the base that prevents the wand from laying flat or even close to to flat. This completely defeats one of the biggest benefits of having a canister vacuum.The wand attachments constantly fall out of the recesses on the handle where they clip in for storage.The power cord is shorter than average.I can not recommend avoiding this vacuum highly enough."
1,Good Product Horrible Customer Service,"This vacuum works well. However, it has a plastic clamp for the carpet beater attchment which is easily broken. Ours broke within 4 months. We contacted an Electrolux certified dealer who was surly and rude. He told us not to call him - he would call us when the replacement part under warranty came in. We are still waiting for the call. I contacted Electrolux on Facebook. They said they would contact me to resolve the situation. I never heard from them again. My husband found the part on line for $2.00. We bought 10, and we have used 3 so far. I will never buy another Electrolux product since they can't be bothered with their customers."
4,Best vacuum ever so far,"After spending about a month researching vacuums, we purchased this about a month ago. We are very happy so far. It is light and handles great with wonderful suction. Our house is a mix of carpet and hardwood so switching between the two systems works great, plus I need to carry it up and down stairs.My only wish is that the would have put an off and on switch on the handle and not on the canister for more ease.I would surely recommend this system."
1,Very poorly designed and far too expensive You can get a better vacuum at Walmart for $40,"Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. However, I am not pleased. It is constantly broken......extremely poor design and engineering. Sloppy manufacturing. The motor burnt out three times. The parts are very cheap plastic......but looks excellent and elegant. Too bad! I feel I was ripped off.Never will I buy Electrolux again!."
2,Disappointed,"I've used this vacuum for 5 months now. The attachments don't store in the vacuum. The plastic hose seems very cheap and difficult to manuever when using. The connection to the carpet sweeper is now not working and have to take it in to a local vacuum repair shop. I've owned a Hoover, and Kenmore canister vacuum and find these vacuums to be superior to the Electrolux. One positive to the Electrolux is its size."
1,"Unreliable, warranty service poor, when it works it cleans well","When it is working, it works well. But with in a total of 9 months of use, the vacuum blew a motor (~3-4 months,) and had to go for warranty repair. This took about a month to repair and 200 miles of driving to drop off the device, and pick it up. Now this Sunday it is overheating again and a change bag light is on. We changed both to a new bag, and a new HEPA filter, but the light won't go off. Will have to call the new, certainly not improved, Electrolux company to see what to do next , but it doesn't seem to be a customer reparable issue."
3,"pulls to left, breaks easily","Bought this a year ago. Tends to pull to the left, which is especially annoying when vacuuming with your left hand. I kept the unit because it has great suction. However, after a year of light use (I only own a few area rugs), a plastic tab broke from the connection to the motor head. This rendered the entire motor head unusable since the tube pulls right out when I vacuum. Since I never disconnect the motor head, the fact that the tab broke indicates that it was made really poorly. I brought it to two repair places (the first one doesn't do warranty work). They both said that these units are always breaking, though the motor is strong."
2,Make sure you get the same model you ordered,The product name at the time I ordered it from Amazon was Electrolux EL6988E Oxygen3 Canister.The model that arrived was the older EL6988D model. Make sure you get the model number you expected.
3,Don't make them like they used to!,"Lightweight canister and handle are great, but suction stinks! Carpet attachment is powerful, but not good for area rugs or scatter rugs because it draws them into the attachment and can break it and ruin the rugs! Suction is not good. Small brush constantly comes off the handle where it is stored and is very annoying. Floor attachment is long and the brush picks up the dog hair, but the suction hole is small and not powerful.Will not last long. Liked my Sears Progressive much better, but it broke after just 3 years! This won't last the 10-15 years my original Electrolux's lasted, that's for sure! Can't seem to get a decent, long-lasting vacuum cleaner for a decent price! And I have had a lot of them! Too much of a hassle to return this and I am sure I won't find one much better anyway."
2,Shoddy consctruction,"Attractive design, compact, quiet, efficient, versatile. BUT the electrical connection from body to carpet brush is flimsy. It failed once (just out of warranty of course) and now it's failing again. I won't get it fixed and I won't buy another [Eureka] Electrolux."
2,"Good for carpets, not for hardwood","After the Electrolux vacuum that was handed down from me from my mother finally crapped out, I decided to buy another Electrolux because the last one lasted 20 years. I didn't realize at the time that the oxygen is made by a totally different company. Well, I am fairly disappointed in this vacuum and I guess $400 doesn't get you much these days. While the power head is fine on carpet, it is too bulky and clumsy for hardwood floors, which is 80% of my house surfaces. When I switch to the hardwood attachment, it ""pressure-fits"" on, which means there is nothing to lock it into place. EVERY SINGLE TIME I AM CLEANING HARDWOODS, the hardwood attachment will fall off and I will have to crawl under a bed, or a dresser, or the TV stand to retrieve it. When I first got the vacuum, I thought I might be missing a piece that would connect the handle to the attachment....this vacuum just doesn't make sense!!"
5,Electrolux - Not your Mother's Electrolux - better,This canister is excellent. Great floor cleaning & the rug cleaner operates very well. I went under the bed for the first time in a long time was able to clean all of the rug. No dust was floating around in the light. The vac bag is sealed and keeps dust inside. Easy to cart around or roll. Nice long cord. Takes up little storage space.very user friendly.
2,Misleading,"This vacuum is NOT an Electrolux!! It is made by Eureka.I bought what I believed was a brand-new Electrolux vacuum cleaner. The reason we chose this brand was that this vacuum cleaner - or what we thought was Electrolux - received top ratings from Consumer Reports.The wand broke on the vacuum after only 1 year, so I took it to the local Electrolux store for repair. This is when I found out that the vacuum WAS NOT made by Electrolux . . . it was a Eureka vacuum cleaner. I was informed that he would not be able to repair it for me but could offer me a trade-in $50 toward an actual Electrolux from his store . . . huge difference in the quality of vacuum.According to the Electrolux representative, a Swedish company (apparently the company that established and originally sold Electrolux) bought back the Electrolux name from Electrolux in the U.S. The Swedish company subsequently bought Eureka and promptly put the Electrolux name on Eureka vacuum cleaners.I'll be the fool."
4,So Bad,"I have only had the vacuum a month, and it's doing fine. But, the powered rug attachment came off during vacuuming and a small plastic ring seems to be the way to reattach. That is a little scary!November news--The Oxygen3 (Eureka really) vacuum is horrible! The plastic ring continued to come off during each use, and the telescoping wand came apart and would not go back together. I traded this vacuum in on a new truly Electrolux Aerus canister vacuum."
2,Very disappointing,"I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because it still worked a tad better than my absolutely pathetic Dirt Devil. However, it was so far from what I expected that it's not even funny. I saw it rated relatively high on several sites and I am still trying to figure out what kind of conspiracy there is behind those ratings. Had it been some American brand, I would have attributed the extremely non-objective opinions to patriotism. But it is made in Sweden - which I thought was a good sign - yet it is a bad product. Save yourself the grief and buy the German made Miele. It looks like the Germans are the only ones left on this Earth who have the decency to abstain from ripping people off by selling garbage."
2,TOO HEAVY,THIS IS A NICE VAC. BUT IT IS WAY TOO HEAVY AND HARD TO PUSH. ALSO THE HOSE HAS A KINK AND ITOLD AMAZON AND HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING. I THINK THE CO. SHOULD REPLACE IT BUT AM STILL WAITING.
1,Awkward and heavier than it looks,"The stated product weight is misleading.It probably refers to the canister by itselfBUT the canister PLUS the hose PLUS the motorized brush is what one is lugging up and down stairs.The motorized brush probably weighs about as much as the canister.The UPS deliverer commented on how heavy the box was.Turns out the shipping weight is 29 lbs.Moral: always check the shipping weight and compare it to the stated product weight.A major difference between the shipping and product weights should be questioned.The cost of returning the product (20% restocking in my case) plus freight makes being unhappy with it a double blow.(Tho one cannot fault the seller for recovering its costs.)Thus I am bitterly disappointed.If you have ordered it, unpack it VERY carefully - making careful notes as to how the pieces are in the box.Repacking is EXTREMELY difficult otherwise."
3,Electrolux EL 6988D Oxygen Canister Vacuum,"As a long time user of electrolux products, this is my first dissappointing experience. While the canister is lightweight, quiet and seems to have sufficient power, the hose is bulky and not very flexible, the handle is big and very uncomfortable in my hand, the handle only turns or pivots in one direction when using the carpet tool, and the tool for hardwood floors is too wide, making it difficult and often impossible to access areas narrower than the 14"" head. Furthermore, with a 14"" spread, the suction from the center point to the ends drops off to nothing at the end of the head.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Not really an Electrolux,"This machine is quiet and has a nice design but is poorly made.I first saw it reviewed in Dwell magazine.The first time I used it the tools would easily fall off that weak clips that holds them to the wand handle.The cover for the bag malfunctioned and would not latch.When I had these repairs done I was informed that this machine is actually made by another company (not Electrolux!)Power is adequate although my old ""hand me down"" 1950's Electrolux has way more power and suction!The cord is too short requiring re-plugging as you move from room to room.Also that cord barely retracts into the unit when you push down the handle.Now the cord is getting too warm at the plug. another trip to the repair shop?Too bad Electrolux was willing to sacrifice their reputation to increase profit margins.I won't be buying Electrolux again after this unit dies. (which may be sooner than later at this rate)"
4,Like the HEPA Filter,"This vac has worked great for me. I like the hepa filter since it blocks most of the dust from just being blown back in the room like a non-hepa vac. I have had mine for two years. The only complaint would be the small bag, but I knew when I bought this that for the size I would be changing the bag quite a bit."
1,poorly made,I purchased the EL6988 4 years ago in February. I have had to replace the wand which I put up with it falling out of the connection for a year. Now the hose will not work except for the beater bar. I have tried to get help from Electrolux for days asking about a part number but have gotten the runaround.I would never purchase an electrolux again. I can not afford to buy a vacuum every 4 years; especially at their prices.
3,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"After two days of light use, the automatic breaker on the carpet/floor attachment keeps tripping and shutting off. Needless to say it has been two weeks and I still don't have a vacuum that works. AMAZON is also very hard to deal with in returning the product.Not worth the money you spend. Besides being light weight, it's just like a regular vacumm, don't believe the hype. ELECTROLUX brags that it is ""super quiet"". Well, this is true, the vacuum itself is very quiet, but the floor attachment is as loud as any vacuum on the market, so it's kind of pointless to brag about how quiet this vacuum is. Hope this helps."
2,save your money,"The first time I used this vacuum, the thin, flimsy hose kinked 3 times at the base unit. Just like a cheap garden hose, it kinks, cutting off suction and eventually, shortening the overall life of the hose.The strength of the suction is fairly good.The handle feels a bit big and can feel uncomfortable if you are continuously vacuuming for a fair amount of time.The articulated joint at powered head can be a bit awkward, demanding that you use more force than most vacuums to maneuver the vacuum.The adjustable length of the wand is convenient.The wand will lay flat only at an awkward angle, making vacuuming under your bed, sofa etc. difficult.Unfortunately, the power cord is about 4' shorter than what I am used to on my old Kenmore that this vacuum replaced.You can do better for $300. This vacuum is getting returned and we will keep shopping for something better."
1,ALWAYs broken,"I have had the Electrolux Oxygen for about 2 years. It spends more time in the shop than at home.Latest problem: power to the power head cuts out after a minute or two, and does not come back. At the shop they say it works fine for them - I'm guessing they try it for 1 minute. I live in the country and do not have any choice which shop to take it to.I detest this machine. Am considering buying a $40 upright at Walmart - I can go through 10 of them for what the $#%&# Electrolux cost."
2,Electlolux - not a good quality at all,"I purchased Electrolux oxygen model 4 years ago. Over those years my vacuum was repaired a few times. I was lucky to buy a warranty. Power head was replaced once. Power connectors to the power head are failing a lot. It seems to me that electrolux is totally built of plastic and very, very fragile....."
5,Satisfied Wife,"My wife had purchased a Fantom Lightning Vac some 3 or 4 years ago and had nothing but trouble with it almost from the beginning but for sure after the warranty had expired. After searching the market and being disappointed with the quality of today's vacuums, She remarked that her old Electrolux lasted for more than 20 years and that she should just get another one. Well, we found it on Amazon.Com and read the reviews to which we agreed that some people just aren't mechanically inclined and disregarded the negatives. We purchased the model 6988A and once again, my wife is very pleased with her vacuuming machine. The quality is built in and the performance really satisfies her. Thanks, Electrolux, for building products that our loving spouses like. Well worth the monies."
4,Cleans great Hard to handle,The machine works wonderfully and my wife feels it cleans much better than our previous Hoover wind tunnel. The handle is difficult to use moving to the right but that is a minor problem. Worth the money.
4,Vacuum cleaner,This product is exactly what I was looking for. It works just as well on carpets as it does on hardwood floors. The only drawback is vacuuming the stairs. You need to have one hand on the vacuum cleaner so it doesn't fall. But the suction is great and it gets the job done.
2,Too Easily Broken!!!!,"I am a house cleaner and one of the houses that I clean for has this vacuum. I find that I am having problems with the rug attachment releasing and the prongs bending. The owners had to get new parts and now I think they are starting to wear again. This is a new vac and I am very careful with this equiptment. I would never purchase this vacuum!! I think it is terrible. Definately not made like they used to be. I use alot of different types of vacuums and this is not made well at all!!!! The cleaning power is great so much that it feels like the rug attachment is going to snap off, very powerful!!!!"
1,Cheap Vacuum Cleaner: not true Electrolux,"I purchased this model because it was suppose to be so good at cleaning the air and trapping all the dust. It does a good job of that but it is hard to use. It pulls hard when you are trying to go back and forth. It started to ""squeak"" a month after I purchased it. Now 8 months later the power hose just separated from the nozzle. It's been hard trying to find someone willing to fix it! It is not a true Electrolux machine, even though the company that makes it has rights to use the name. For the money, there must be a better made vacuum cleaner."
3,CR let me down,"My wife and I purchased this unit after conducting research, including the Consumer Reports website. Although after a few uses it does seem to function well, it is extremely hard to control. The head swivels in only one direction, making it very difficult to push the brush head in the other direction. Even when pushing it straight it feels like it wants to turn into the direction of the swivel. I am a fairly strong guy and yet I have to fight with it. It's awkward to maneuver around furniture or table legs.On the positive side, it is quiet and it seems to work quite well. The cord retraction is fast and reliable. Thus far we have not had a single issue with it. With a properly swiveling brush, this would turn into a 5 star review."
4,Great Purchase.,"The complaint previous reviewers have mentioned regarding the carpet attachment's design flaw in only rotating in one direction is quite accurate and infuriating. The power cord is also about 15' too short. Other than that, this is the best vacuum ever. It's quiet, powerful, and versatile. What else could you ask for?"
5,Christmas Surprise,"I purchased this vacuum for my wife for Christmas. After using ""disposable"" upright vacuums since we have been married (nearly 10 years), we have never been happy at the performance of these ""cheap"" vacuums.I read a lot of reviews and did a lot of research before buying the oxygen. Like some of the other reviewers I grew up with an Electrolux vacuum. My mother had hers for over 20 years.My wife was very surprised when she opened her gift on Christmas and took it right out of the box, assembling it right away. I must say the she did the assembly by herself without any instructions.This vacuum is AMAZING! It is very quiet, very powerful and cleans very well!!! Matter of fact she was cleaning in another room and I couldn't even hear it. The power head does make noise but it IS a vacuum, so what do you expect.We LOVE this vacuum and recommend it to others reading these reviews!"
1,Think Twice,"We have owened the Electrolux Oxygen vacuum cleaner for about one year. We purchased it after reading reviews here at Amazon and the Electrolux name and reputation.This is the first time reviews here at Amazon were not quite accurate as they have been with other products we have purchased here in the past.By far, this is the worst performing vacuum cleaner we have ever owned! The suction is poor and it just does not do a very good cleaning job.The position of the on/off button on the handle is poor. You will inadvertantly shut the vacuum off many times during every cleaning session.Even at the highest setting it will not pick up cat hair. There is one good thing, it is easy to move around but that's about it.I can not recommend the Electrolux Oxygen vacuum cleaner.I suggest you look for sometime different."
4,It is what it says it is,"This vacuum is small, quiet and red and it sucks like a vacuum. We have all hardwood and I can say that so far (1 month) the value seems to be high. Recommended for sure."
2,powerheaddefective,the powerhead falls apart-disassembles- electrolux has no answer- seems like i am stuck with a vacuum that really sucks but doesnt work-$340 up in smoke- i think i could have found more pleasureable to do that-
2,Poor workmanship,"I bought this vacuum because of the legendary Electrolux name. I really like the vacuum, but the workmanship is poor. I have only owned it for 3 months and the power head broke off the wand of the vacuum. It is only held together by plastic and I am waiting for the company to replace the power head now. Again this is a nice vacuum but I want to see if the new power head will hold up to weekly use."
2,"Good Performance, Until It Breaks","I did a lot of research before buying this vacuum a couple of years ago. I really liked it, though it does shoot stuff out of the back on hard floors, as someone wrote in a previous comment.In the past two weeks, the vacuum and it's accessories have broken. First, it was an extra attachment we bought separately (from Electrolux/Eureka) that is a power stair attachment. It was great. Then, the roller in it stopped spinning. It's not an attachment we used every day--maybe once per month. So, it wasn't broken due to overuse.About a week later, the roller in the vacuum stopped spinning. The vacuum still has suction. I can't figure out if it's an electrical or mechanical problem. I just can't believe that it broke considering how much money it cost! We don't have pets or any major messes, so I haven't put any undue stress on the vacuum!"
3,the cleaning lady,"What I find to be extremely heavy is the power head, very difficult to pick up and scootch into difficult places. Others have mentioned the kink in the hose. Mine has not only kinked but now it is shorting out and I will have to pay at least 77 dollars for a new one that also won't rotate as you move to prevent the problem. It does have good suction though, especially on carpets, not as good on smooth floors."
1,Do Not Buy,This item stopped working after two years. worst part is that i bought this in 2008 (since it worked great the firt year) and a second one in 2009. Neither is working as of December 2011.
1,Hard to use,I purchased this vacuum because it said it was light weight. Not!It is the most difficult vacuum I have ever used. The suction is great but by the time you finish using it you feel like you just wrestled a bear. I only use it for major cleaning because I actually hurt when I am done. I gave it to my neighbor for her to try and she too could not believe how difficult it was to use. I dread it everytime I use it. Now I am looking for a lighter weight vacuum for everyday.
2,The connectors in the wands are its weak links.,"The vaccuum and the powerhead is fantastic. The little connectors in the wands (2 tiny prongs in each) are an example of poor engineering. They brake often. I bought new wands on eBay once a year (sometimes more often). The newer model, that I bought this year) have an improved system, and so far no problems with the connectors."
1,Eureka Rebranded as Electrolux! JUNK!!,"Read all the other one star reviews!! They all describe my experience with this over priced piece of junk perfectly!! Which is, come to find out, a Eureka with a high price tag. High price, poor quality, poor service with company, poor experience with ""authorized"" repair facilities who are overloaded with repairs on this very low quality vacuum. would never recommend or EVER purchase any electrolux product ever again, Huge disappointment"
1,don't be duped---these are EUREKA rebranded!!!,"When i bought one of these Electrolux green cannisters - i was thrilled thinking ""finally--I have a real Electrolux with the top of the line suction and cleaning you can buy"". Nope. First week it failed electrically. When I brought it back, there were literally 3 broken ones sitting at the service desk and another couple bringing their back in too. Fast forward 2 years later - its been to an authorized dealer because there's no suction and I find out -- Eletrolux rebranded the old Eureka machines, dressed them up and called them Elextrolux. Don't be duped. You can buy the same quality motor and roller system for 100 bucks at a discount store!!!! All the information above was verified by my cleaning service--they buy the classics not this junk!"
2,frustrating,I am not sure if my vacuum is defective or if the oxygen power nozzle is designed to only rotate to the left. My arm hurts after trying to vacuum to the right. I have to pick up power nozzle to go right. I did call customer service but did not get a clear explanation.
2,Too expensive for a cheaply made vacuum.,"Read most of the negative reviews here and you will find a common theme, the connection between the wand and the vacuum is held together by a cheap plastic wand clamp that keeps popping off whenever you turn the wand. I have this problem as well after a year and a half of owning the vacuum. Mines also overheats now as well. This is a piece of garbage vacuum cleaner; do not buy this model! This is a $70 vacuum cleaner with a $300 price tag!"
5,WOW!!!,"Love this vacuum cleaner. Small easy to use and store. Picks up dog hair really good, better than any vacuum we have ever owned. Love it, Love it, Love it!!!"
2,Slick vacuum but weak link in design,"We loved this vacuum from the day it arrived until the day it broke. The cleaning head is held onto the arm by a tiny plastic C-clamp which locks into place with even tinier plastic pins. A few months of very gentle use and those pins came off. Electrolux has now agreed to send us a replacement clamp, but the service person on the phone made clear she would send just one and that this was a ""courtesy"". What about 4 months from now when the new one breaks? This is clearly a design flaw, and the manufacturer should include 5 or 10 of these things for the vacuum to still work a few years after purchase."
1,Poor Service,"The Electrolux Olygen vacuum clean purchased from Amazon arrived with a broken wand connector. I took it in for service, waited 3 weeks for a different colored part to arrive, and was told by Electrolux to live with it. So now I have a brand new patchworked vacuum cleaner. It might come as a surprise to their customer service department, but when someone buys a new vacuum cleaner that's what they expect! Consider how they treat their customers before purchasing."
1,Piece of junk,"I have owned this vacuum for over two years. Since I have bought it I have had to replace the drive belt 5 times (finally got a heavy duty version that did the trick) and replace 5 wand sections because the electrical connections burned out, and replaced the hose section once because the electrical connections melted, nearly causing a fire. This vacuum was poorly designed and replacement parts are not cheap. This is not your mother's Electrolux. Stay away.. stay very far away!"
2,"Great band, weak album","This is NOT the best of HUM. Nowhere near it. If you're interested in melodic, well-crafted post-hardcore, buy ""Downward is Heavenward"" (HUM's most creative album) or ""You'd Prefer an Astronaut"" (the most catchy of their albums). This band will always lack on vocals, and sometimes their lyrics leave room for more, but the music makes it worth your listen. If you're looking for something to supplement your CD collection, instead of wasting your money on HUM's ""Electra 2000"", try Castor's ""Tracking Sounds Only""."
4,quirky hard rock that is the groundwork of for all other hum,"This album rocks harder than all of their other albums, but may be a little sloppier and less produced. Some would say this is good, others not so good . Either way you look at it this is a definate for any ""rocker"" or curious where hum made their name."
5,Huge space rock.,"The band that out rocked and out grunged Nirvana, HUM provides their first masterpiece (see Heavenward for their second masterpiece) and heaviest of their 3 available CD's.Also, check out ""Fillet Show"" their first CD, independently released, if you can find it."
5,These guys (and girls) rock!,"Good stuff, very Cure-ish with accents of techno and Nine Inch Nails. I met the lead singer in an Apple store in Buffalo, New York and he is a very nice guy. Listened to some of their music, and had to buy the album. Check out their website ( www.cruxshadows.com ) for more info and pictures of the band."
4,Wishfire by Cruxshadows,Have not listen to this CD very long but as always love Cruxshadows. Alittle different from the others I have but still very good.
4,Let's be honest here...,"The Cruxshadows, quite simply, blow me away.Not only are their live performances the BEST of the American goth scene, but their music captivates and enthralls outside of the club experience as well.Now...to be completely honest I will have to admit that for this fan at least, this is not the best CXS release. If you are new to the band I might recommend that you first get to know _Paradox Addendum_ and _Mystery of the Whisper_...but _Wishfire_ definitely builds upon these previous releases and live, the songs are even better.My fave songs aren't the first ones on the album and to all who aren't sure that you like what you hear at first, keep listening!One final note...if you've not experienced CXS live you are truly missing out...they are absolutely dynamic and each band member simply oozes charisma as well as both refreshing honesty and a willingness to really listen to their fans."
5,Surpassed my expectations,"After their brilliant previous CD's, the Cruxshadows had some big expectations to live up to with ""Wishfire"". After listening to the entire CD today, I'm happy to report that they have surpassed all expectations ten-fold. Buy this CD, I implore you. Do not hesitate.I'm looking forward to seeing them play Detroit on the Wishfire tour!"
1,OH MY GOTH THIS STINKS!!!,"SYNTH-POP HAS UTTERLY DESTROYED THE GOTH SCENE FOREVER.One of the absolute worst albums I have ever heard - I can't even listen to it all the way through! I tried to give them a chance I tell you, I tried! But, THIS SUCKS! I wish I could give them a negative rating. It would be most deserved.This band is so intolerably bad it hurts. And to consider themselves Goth as well? Now that's nothing more that a slam on Goths. No self respecting Goth over the age of 12 should ever consider for one micro-second, lowering themselves enough to listen to this drivel. The derivative, contrite, boring, repetitive, unimaginative and utterly thoughtless sounds they've recorded have been forced on the club going public by ignorant DJ's with no sense of history or taste in music.The lead singer can't sing to save his life and it's clear to me that one night when they were all teenagers they each made a wish that they could grow up and be in Depeche Mode.Whatever happened to Gothic Rock?"
5,All hail the Cruxshadows!,"This album is just another example of why the Cruxshadows are the rising star of the international ""goth scene"". It shows the bands ability to progress and improve on their previous dark-wave sound and still come out with an amazing album.With ""Wishfire"" the Cruxshadows move towards a more beat-lead, dance-floor friendly sound with out completely losing touch with the sound of their previous album. ""Wishfire"" is an exploration of the Cruxshadows world in a more EBM styled way- which shows the bands ability to keep up with current treads, without getting stuck in the past or damaging their musical reputation. ""Wishfire"" presents a much more polished and completed Cruxshadows sound, a sound that has lost nothing in its move towards EBM and has gained great ground in stunning the listener with the quality and magic of the Cruxshadows unique world.buy this album. right now. go!"
5,Very nice herbal tea,"This is a great tasting tea that really seems to help when you're not feeling so well. Any time I have cold or flu symptoms, I reach for this tea. It's also good for drinking with breakfast or any time since it has no caffeine."
2,as described but...,"This thumbstrap option would work well for my Ruger GP100 or most any other handgun with exposed hammer, hammer down. This item does not work well at all with a Glock (no exposed hammer) or similar. Also, it does not work with my 1911 as I carry it in condition one. The strap is really not long enough to go around behind the grip. Otherwise, good product from Bianchi, as advertised."
4,Everything you wanted to know about DHCP,"The book is organized well, has an excellent index and provides detailed information from basic concepts through to advanced configurations, diagnostics and troubleshooting. I obtained this book because our organization had just deployed new DNS/DHCP appliances and there were problems with the DHCP failover configuration. This book provided as much detail as I could have asked for. It turned out that, (at the time of writing this review, Jan 2007) ISC DHCP failover is thoroughly broken. So although this book couldn't help me with our failover problem, I still recommend it for those who need a comprehensive DHCP reference."
4,An excellent DHCP book for learning and reference,I have been supporting and programming dhcp for many years and find the DHCP Handbook an excellent reference for DHCP operations on Linux.
1,terrible,"all it is is a second edition of The DHCP Handbook: Understanding, Deploying, and Managing Automated Configuration Services. First edition was bad, this was better but non the least. Still full of technical flaws and bad advice. Get the O'reilly Dhcp book, you won't be disappointed. I'm using this as a coster for my coffe mug."
5,Out of this world!,I once tried to describe the design eras of the twentieth century to an acquaintance. In the process I mentioned that Raymond Scott was the penultimate soundtrack for appreciating Art Deco. Rarely do I get it so right... (You'll love it!)
5,A great album made (a little) better,"I just replaced my 1992 version of this release with the new remastered version. I listened closely to both of them and the sound quality of the new version is an improvement. However, it's not such a drastic improvement that everyone who owns the older version should toss it out and go get this one."
5,Less is More for this 'Remastered' CD,"* * * * * +THIS IS A WONDERFUL CD! The music is timeless...When the first version of this CD was released in 1992, the CD's sound-quality may have left something to be desired. However, THIS version of the CD sounds fantastic; it's amazing all the bass, and other parts, that I never noticed before! (The secret? I'm not a technical expert, but I think they actually did LESS processing of the original [1930s] master disc recordings this time... But whatever the process was, the results are a definitely a knock out!)* * * * * +"
4,Music that's just fun,"These songs bring back memories of being a kid and watching cartoons. Even though I don't watch many cartoons anymore, there's a delicious wackiness to these songs that makes them fun to listen to."
1,Don't waste your time on this one.,"This book by far contains the poorest quality photography I have ever seen printed in a ""book."" Many images are overexposed and pixelated making this author and publisher duo nothing short of a hack team. On such a immense topic as Bethlehem Steel this book does it the greatest of injustices. It is sad to see what some people will do for money and if you are looking for a better pictoral account of Bethlehem Steel purchase the Andrew Garn book. The Garn book also has a much stronger text foward and introduction.I threw out my copy in disgust realizing I can't even resell it."
5,"First Formal, Extensive Study of Cannabis's Effects","This is the classic study, first of its kind, of marijuana's subjective effects. Dr. Tart surveyed 150 users, most of them from California, back in 1970 or so. He clearly documents the most characteristic and common effects of the drug, providing clear, scientific evidence explained in an accessible way. He makes the emotional, perceptual, and social effects of the drug very clear, and makes reference to related material in the consciousness literature. The book also gives a great feel for its era. Questions concerning ESP, social 'games' and 'hang-ups', etc. give the reader a great feel for the counterculture of the late 60s and early 70s. A real find. Fun, scientific, accessible, and informative."
5,Readiris Pro 11 Asian,"I am very pleased with the software. I am still learning to use it, but right away I was able to scan and translate the documents I needed to work on. The manual is a little confusing, but I still managed to make it work."
5,"Solid album, Solid band","These guys ROCK. This album; Hallelujah I'm Gonna Kiss Myself, and another called Doug, which i believe may have been a soundtrack, are the center of my rock collection. i saw them live aswell, at the fireside in chicago, a kick ass show, they played one of my favorite tracks; Northwest Incinerator and heatmiser a track off Doug. You should buy this album and get the word out. Go to http://www.nil8.com to hear samples"
5,"Springfield, Illinois' Very Own","This group is incredible to listen to live. The album is absolute magic. If you ever went to one of their shows at The Atrium, you know what I'm talking about. The only way to listen to this music is to crank it up and just let it sing through you. If you want to hear something spectacular, you have to listen to ""Green Eggs & Ham."" The bass work is fantastic!!"
1,Questionable quality from this manufacturer,"I recently received a similar gift item by Cutie Pie Baby--a 6-piece bath set. Although the design is really adorable, the quality is very low. I washed the items (hooded towel, washcloths, etc) as instructed, and they fell apart. I am attempting to get some resolution from the manufacturer, but have been told that there is no customer service department and I have to find a store that sells the item if I want to return it. The combination of shoddy workmanship and poor service I have experienced with this manufacturer leads me to recommend spending your money on something else."
1,AVOID THIS DVD LIKE THE PLAGUE,"This DVD is a totally useless presentation of Santana's techniques. Curt Mitchell is an excellent guitarist, but it's obvious that he has no inherent appreciation of Santana's music, and does not work in this particular genre, as his presentation here is totally shallow and one-dimensional. This ""effort"" was obviously an attempt at a quick money-maker.....but to no avail. Carlos Santana has such a wealth of music behind him, it's a total shame and ripoff that nothing beyond the most simplistic riffs are presented. AVOID THIS DVD .... you will return it the same day you receive it. (Tip: if you want to get the most from a Curt Mitchell treatment of popular guitar work, visit his Van Halen DVD.)"
5,In Love,"This mobile was a shower gift from my Amazon.com baby registry. It has been over my daughter's crib since the day she was born. I figured I'd get about 9 months use from it, and I did... and then some! My daughter is now 14 months old and she is still so in love with her mobile. If I try to leave her in her crib without starting the music she cries until I come back and wind it up. Everyday when she wakes up, she stands up in her crib and hugs the mobile.If you are having a girl, and you like the colors, BUY THIS WHOLE SET!!! I did, and I couldn't be happier... and neither could my daughter."
3,Beautifully Broken,Well I bought this item in December/05 and it is now Feb/06. My daughter loves it and will keep her quiet for as long as the mobile is playing it's music. I had to keep winding it and as a result...it broke. It totally sucks too because I myself fell in love with it. It's to expensive to replace and now I don't know what to do. ::sigh::
2,Cute but not Quality,"My 3 month old daughter loves her mobile. She loves to watch the butterflies go around and sometimes, that's the only thing that seems to calm her down. We got the mobile in Jan. 06 and it's now the middle of April, and the music stalls. If you push the arms of the mobile, maybe it might play, maybe, but not always. I've taken it apart and there seems to be nothing askew, but obviously there is. She gets very frustrated when the butterflies stop so suddenly and only after 15 seconds of play. Sometimes it won't even play after being wound. I had a mobile when I was a child and it still works to this day, almost 30 years later. I love the cute factor of the mobile, but the quality assurance is awful."
2,Cute but didn't fit,"Cute mobile, but it didn't fit on my crib. We had a crib custom made at an Amish store in Middlebury, IN"
3,Beautiful but not for every bed type,"I have the Gossamer wings crib set that I am very pleased with however, I purchased the mobile and realized when I got home that it will not mount on my baby crib. I think this mobile is made to fit standard cribs but I have one of the newer sleigh type cribs and the slats are too wide. My advice, see if you can try it at the store before you buy it."
3,Needs longer play time,"This is a beautiful mobile that is a must have for anyone doing Gossamer Wings. There is a down fall, once wound, it only spins & plays music for a minute or two. My daughter does LOVE to watch it spin which eventually puts her to sleep, but by the time I get her settled & walk out of the room, it stops & she cries until I wind it again & again! I am now searching for a mobile that spins for at least 8 - 10 minutes, no matter what it looks like! It also didn't mount right on our crib (sleigh type/4 in 1)no matter where we tried. It is on, but kind of lop sided, once my daughter can get to it, it will need to come down. It really isn't that stable."
2,DOES NOT FIT ALL CRIBS,"This is a very cute mobile, however, for $40.00 it should be a universal fit. It isnt. I have the whole Gossamer wings decor, but can not use the mobile because it doesnt fit my daughter's crib. We have a sleigh style ""Serenity"" crib and the slats are too thick. VERY DISSAPOINTING since she LOVED the mobile on her bassinet. I dont know what Im going to do...The 2 stars are for the look only."
1,Pretty but ineffective,"Ok-- so it matches the rest of the set, but my baby has little to no interest in it because the colors are so muted and blend together with no contrast. Then the stupid thing turns off every couple of minutes and has to be wound up again. I would have much prefered a battery operated one that last a little longer. I actually cut the butterflies, etc off and sewed bright colored shapes to reattach to the mobile and baby is a little more interested now, but it still shuts off too quickly. Don't waist your money, get one of the high contrast mobiles-- even if it doesn't go with your nursery decor."
5,they try hard enough,"Listening to this album for the first time i had no idea what to expect.What i found was some really intense stuff!I expected ee to be more of a lyrical band(as most indie bands are) but i was strangely and nicely surprised.Most of these songs are instrumentals and the songs that do have lyrics are really sweet and fun. Oh my god they are fun,i love it in ""Drunk in carthage"" he says,""maybe a satellite will fall for you tonight"", thats great, but the song that tore me the most was the very first one.It's very melodic and soulful and it feels like you're in an alternate dimension somewhere floating in the ether or something.I also think its ravagingly brilliant the way they put 99 tracks on the cd, the most you can fit on a cd.Proving once and for all, for 99 they will not try harder.100 will never happen."
1,Great CD marred by overzealous Copy Protection,"Unfortunately, this otherwise great release is marred by Sony/BMG's overzealous Sunncomm MediaMax Version 5 copy protection.Lawsuits have been filed about the copy protection, which Sony/BMG still has yet to recall:http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_11.php#004192"
1,Wack To The Max,"After hearing ""I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)"" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa!"
3,Just 3 Stars For Pain,"This album was just alright to me. Of course you had to like ""I'm Sprung"" and ""I'm N Luv Wit A Stripper"". But other tracks that might catch your ear is ""Let's Get It On"", ""Como Estas"", ""Going Thru A Lot"", ""Dance Floor"" wit Akon [which should be the next single in my opinion], and ""My Place"". But the rest of the album just didn't live up to my expectations as a listener, plus it didn't help that his album was 'copy protected' which causes viruses in your pc."
2,"Im not ""sprung"" and probably never will be!","Another useless debut album.More untalented rappers,and more karaoke than ever before.T'Pain sucks and so does his music.And by the way the song ""Im in luv with a stripper"" or whatever it is way overrated!"
5,Dawg I think that um HIgh!!!!,"Shotout to ""The Mad Violinist"" Ashanti for producing ""I'm High"" featuring Styles P on the T-Pain album. Another 850 representa' doing big thangs. It's crazy how all of a sudden talent can just pop out of one place([...]).I must say ""I'm High"" off of the whole album."
2,Not Exactly A Hit,"I somehow listened to the whole CD and I just wasn't impressed. It didn't surprise me that the only decent songs were I'm Sprung, the Remix, and I'm N Luv Wit A Stripper. ""Studio Luv"" could be a possible single in my opinion. One of the best songs he has done isn't even on the CD and that's ""Ask For It"" feat. Nivea. Basically, he needs to stick to being ""featured"" in songs, because he can't hold his own. Too bad."
1,Great CD marred by overzealous Copy Protection,"Unfortunately, this otherwise great release is marred by Sony/BMG's overzealous ""rootkit"" Sunncomm MediaMax Version 5 copy protection that will leave your computer vulnerable to hackers, trojans, and virus attacks.You can read more about the dangers of playing a CD with the rootkit on your computer on the Sysinternals website. I'd advise not to buy this if you don't want your computer to be vulnerable to viruses/trojans/hackers."
5,Tight work,This is a must have CD in everyones collection. Every track on this is a hit. I listen to this CD all the time all the way from begaining to end. T-Pain did it with this album. If you ever have a chance to see him perform live. GO!!! He has a great live performence. I have been to some of his shows and injoyed them all. T-Pain this is it the 850 on da map. holla at ya boi. Cled - Co-Lab Productions (www.co-lab4life.com)
2,bad singing,the beats are hot as fu*k but the singing is just terrible. the beats are crazy on this disc but t-pain cant sing for his life at all. you can tell his voice is all metallic on his songs. but two stars for the beats. the lyrics aren't very good either.
5,These guyz are Kewl!!!!!!!!!,Hey!!if u have never heard the supersuckers music and u would like to Go onto there 96' CD The Sacrilicious sounds of Supersuckers!!!They seem pretty kewl!!And i think im gonna buy there CD!!=)
3,It is what it is,As the title reads it is the blues not bad blues but not out standing blues either o k listening
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Falling Down is an intelligent and often blackly comic drama with an impressive performance by Douglas in the lead; it's probably not as high-regarded today as it should be, and it's worth seeking out."
3,Somewhat predictable,"The plot is somewhat predictable -- and slow moving. If you relate to this movie showing an aerospace engineer descend into vilolence, recommed seeking immediate medical attention."
5,Falling...into love with this film,"This movie will make you laugh, cry, and think. This guy may seem like a pscho path, but he's just a normal dude that is fed up with all the bull crap in the world. If like action,adventure and love to laugh. This is the one for you. Buy it right now !!!!"
2,"""I'm the bad guy?""","Joel Schumacher could've had a killer movie: a feature-length newspaper headline reading ""Angry White Male Cuts Swath of Destruction Across L.A."" It couldah been a contendah. And besides, how can you go wrong with Douglas and Duvall?But it does go wrong. First, we get recycled ethnic characters from every possible ethnic group (AWMs included in Douglas himself, wearing 60s knock-off classes, a white shirt and a pocket protector for heaven's sake). Even then, the movie could have been great in a schlocky kind of way, a fantasy revenge flick for AWMs. But then Schumacher totally blows the other parts of the story, particularly Duvall's Detective Prendergast as a recycled detective-on-the-verge-of-retirement, a cliche so common that it's been repeatedly lampooned in movies like ""Short Time"" and cartoons like ""The Simpsons"": ""No! NO! MENDDDOOOOZAAA!""In short: great principle story and actors ruined by tired supporting characters and secondary plot."
2,on the edge,"takes an interesting premise and then takes it a bit too far. In addition, I felt that the movie went for the easy gags/shock effect, like the pepsi incident, while he was trying to make a phone call. And call me crazy, but have you ever heard of a cop on his last day before retirement acting like Duval did? Ya godda be kidding, the movie fell down, er..., on that alone!!"
2,Fell on it's face,"What was the point of Falling Down? If you can answer that question, you win the jackpot. OK, so Michael Douglas's character had a meltdown and is supposedly sticking up for the rights of the consumer. To think someone could go through L.A shooting up fast food restaurants and scaring away gang members twice your size with a bat just doesn't make any sense. I don't care if it is Hollywood. You still have to make logical sense. There were way to many coincidences. Things just did not add up at certain parts in the movie. The acting was good, but of course, what do you expect from Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall? I thought the background music was terrific though. It contributed to the movie in appropriate ways, and I think it is what kept this movie from sticking to the fan. Overall, Falling Down is a huge disappointment that has really no point to it. 2 Stars"
3,Don't you think....,"... The Foo Fighters do it better on their video ""Walk""? Much briefer, funny, and with better music - oh, and it has Dave Grohl at his wackiest nerdy best."
3,"Good movie, bed ending.","I liked this movie a lot, but when it ended, i hated it. O.K. Michael Douglas gets killed by old man Duvall, what is there not to like about it, a lot of things. I am only 15 years old and have seen more then 1000 R-rated movies, i like old B/W films too, but win it comes to the ending of this film, i does what to cut that video in 2. I am not saying that this is a bad movie, i am saying the ending is does down the hall.note: Rated R for Strong Language and Violence."
1,"Movie is great, but...","as I am reviewing the product I am giving only one star because Amazon has wrong information for this DVD; according with the product details this movie has spanish audio, however I bought it and audio and subtitles are only in english and french.I can't understand why Amazon gives wrong information for users."
3,ight good movie,Good funny movie nothing out of da ordinary...was expecting more but overall i liked it. Movie keeps u on your toes big adventure. It jumps from scene to scene if u blink u missed a lot
4,Fred and Mike go over the top,"This is a film that wants to eat it's cake and have it. It wants us to get off on the vigilante violence and then puts in a studio dislaimer at the end explaining that we don't endorse this sort of behaviour. Veteran actor Duvall does the honours on their behalf. It is short on solutions but long on laughs. My favourite bit is with the water pistol. My mate Nigel 'Spunky' Turner says he loves it when it all spurts out. Hope he sees the film too, sometime."
4,falling down,"I first saw this movie a couple years ago and enjoyed it. I didn't see it as a film about ""white middle class rage""; I simply saw it as a film about any person's rage, be they white, black, latino, asian, or any other ethnic group. There are times I feel like Michael Douglas's character-angry, frustrated, and ready to take out anyone or anything that gets in my way. Of course, life is too short to be pissed off, which is conveyed at the end"
4,Something to it,"Some movies stick in your mind. Most don't. This one has stuck in my mind for a long, long time.For one thing - it changed my view of Michael Douglas - from thinking he was basically an average tv actor riding on his dad's coat tails to seeing him as a major acting talent.I see where the official Amazon review is coming from, denouncing the stereotypes etc - but...I think we're seeing the world through this character's eyes. Isn't that an achievement?See it and make up your own mind."
1,Stupid movie ~ don't waste your time,We watched this due to the high review ratings and kept waiting for it to get better. It never did. The characters were not believable and the storyline was lacking.
4,Great commentary on modern day society.,A very entertaining compelling tale about a man who is broken by the system he has served his whole life. Michael Douglas does a superb job of portraying the everyday man broken by the system that promised to take care of him and reward him. It shows a true break down of a man in our society. Very entertaining and sadly realistic.
4,Modern reality meets annoyed citizen,"Worn out, annoyed, unemployed citizen finally deals with the straw that broke the camel's back.In his case, fortunately, luck or divine intervention helps him progressively gain ground in his encounters with the many annoyances that I totally identify with.Toward the end, he clearly makes some decisions that put him entirely in the wrong, making the ending understandable, even if for a greater portion movie, you're rooting for the guy.All in all, a great movie. A happier ending would have gained it that last star I denied it."
4,P.C zipped,"I saw this movie and liked it a lot except the producers had a potential white male hero, so they decided ""Oh yeah, let's turn him into a psychotic husband."" This could have been a great movie...It was however, one additional reason for the above mentioned rage. The ending was flat as day old beer. B."
4,The REAL Minorities,"Tough tough tough to watch.Most employed white Americans are the new minorities in the good ol'USA.Most will relate to Foster in which how precarious life/work can be.No affirmative action,no racial discrimination lawsuits ,no sexual discrimination lawsuits.Just a displaced,white professional downsized and out of luck.Don't watch this if you were recently fired or divorced! Los Angeles never looked worse.Hot,crowded,dirty,perverted.I needed a vacation after watching this film.The lesson..Keep life simple."
4,Our Greatest Fear.,"In life we set our course and we put one foot in front of the other and we start along that chosen path. Every so often something comes along and pushes us one way or the other and we fight to remain on the path we've chosen. We hold on with tenacity, with hope and sometimes through sheer faith that everything will turn out like it's supposed to.Michael Douglas does a fantastic job of playing the part of a man who is sort of yanked from his path, then as he tries to pretend that nothing has changed is given the final push towards oblivion. His actions seem to be those of a psychotic, but the end result, which he outlines for Robert Duvall at the end of the film, sadly, makes sense.He realizes his path is gone, he realizes he is too broken to fix, but some good can still come from his lack of usefullness.He does what we all fear doing while following that path we set for ourselves in life. He falls down and doesn't have it in himself to get back up."
4,Take your pick!,"""A tale of urban reality"". It's not like this round our bit of urban. Michael 'nepotism' Douglas stars as either a victim of modern society frustrated to the point of madness by the callousness of a post-industrial wilderness where the rights of the individual are challenged at every turn and decency and civility are lost in a maelstrom of consumerism and corporate heartlessness, or a self-obsessed moany nutter - take your pick.The best bit is right at the start in the convenience store because the Korean bloke's hilarious, but it's got a good cast including Robert Duvall and Barbara 'obvious nickname' Hershey."
5,Time Capsule,"I love being able to view parts of California then and compare them to now. The same issues that are shown in Falling Down are still very real and observable in today's society. LA is depicted perfectly with regards to the traffic, the lack of jobs, the gang issues, etc... This movie helps show that no matter how much things change, they stay the same."
4,review of Falling Down,"crisp,well written,solid plot line.surely he would've gone to jail for killing the nazi, but didn't devolve(the story)into orge of senseless violence as so many other movies of that genre have."
4,SCHUMACHER DID A GREAT JOB !,"It is amazing that this movie was made by the same guy who practically buried the BATMAN series, Joel Schumacher. Douglas's character is suffocating, we watch him going to meet his tragic end, but we feel we cannot do nothing to prevent, we feel hopeless, because we identify with him, trapped inside the American way of life, trapped inside capitalism. The movie inspired an IRON MAIDEN song called ""MAN ON THE EDGE"", in the album ""THE X-FACTOR""."
1,Falling Down review,Really really like this movie. Michael Douglas is superb in his portrayal as a man frustrated and angry with the world and all the stupid people in it. Love to watch it over and over - never get tired of it. Know all the scenes now by heart. Would reccomend it to anyone.
3,.,"Certainly the best movie I've seen come from Joel Schumacher, and that's only saying so much. Duvall is quite good, and Douglas is excellent (he CAN act!) -- the idea and its execution are pretty interesting as well. There are some quality scenes and moments, even a splash of genuine emotion here and there, but it gets a little carried away at points (like in the silly ""rocket launcher"" sequence) and at such points finds itself dangerously skirting the line between unique drama and pseudo-""socially-minded"" fluff. It is not a bad movie, and worth seeing, but ultimately it suffers from the obvious detracting factor -- Joel Schumacher's involvement. Down with Joel."
4,Great Find!,"Friends introduced us to this cookbook, knowing that we eat vegetarian and follow the Mediterranean diet. What a joy!My only problem to date (I've made 4 recipes to date - our friends an additional 3 or 4) has been a major typo in one of the recipes that left me unsure how to layer a casserole. I went with my best guess, and it was very good!Highly recommended. Great flavors, great variety. I get tired of people saying that to not eat high-fat (especially ""bad"" fat) foods like burgers, fries, bacon, etc., is bland and boring and somehow to be disdained. WRONG! We eat so much better than that! and will eat even better now that we have this book."
5,A great reminder that Jesus is the reason for the season!,"I love Christian Christmas music because it puts emphasis on the most important part of Christmas- Jesus! Point of Grace's ""A Christmas Story"" is no exception. Along with being focused on the right stuff, this cd sounds great! I keep it in my cd player throughout the entire Christmas season. POG adds their own unique touch to traditional Christmas carols such as ""Angel We Have Heard On High"" and ""O Holy Night"" (my personal favorite), while not changing the original feeling of the song. They also have several new songs such as ""Not That Far From Bethlehem"" ""One King"" and ""When Love Came Down"". There are a couple of fun songs too. For example, ""Let It Snow"" and ""Santa Clause Is Coming To Down"". This cd touches all the bases. It has some songs to touch your soul, some to make you smile, and some to sing along with. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to be reminded of the true meaning of Christmas and enjoy the music at the same time."
5,My Favorite - buying for a second time!,"I have owned this cd for at least 4 years. Every year in November (okay, somtimes October) it goes back into my car as that seems to be where I spend the most time sitting down! Yes, it is Christmas music, but the harmonies are so beautiful that I love the music anytime of the year! I am now buying my second one as I have worn out the first. You will not be disappointed in this cd."
2,Don't really care for their style of music...,I bought this album and only like the three songs I heard on the radio from this album. I don't really care for their style.
5,A New Christmas Classic,"As I write this, I am listening to the Motown-style ""Jingle Bell Rock"". It is one of my favorites in the album, and it just makes me lie in front of a fireplace and watch the snow fall outside. This was a very well done album, and Point Of Grace deserves my props! I loved how the instrumental ""Joy To The World"" gave an introduction to what the album was going to be like. Favorites of mine were the combination of ""Let It Snow"" and ""Sleigh Ride"", ""One King"", and ""Not That Far From Bethlehem"". The girls' voices are in top form, and they stretched their limits on this album. You've got everything--pop, swing, Motown, big band, jazz, orchestral, and choral. It is a very eclectic album, and a must-have for Point Of Grace fans and Christmas music fans everywhere!"
1,We never received this from this seller - seller never contacted us after our payment,"Never received this - tried to contact the seller, couldn't find any link to get the sellers attention. The product itself is great - we did own this particular CD by Point of Grace - it's their best!"
5,The Man from Oxford (Mississippi),"Being a fan of Faulkner, I picked up this paperback for about a $1 and was recently reading through it. It offered some great insights into The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying and much more. I think Waggoner's commentary is right on the money. I highly recommend this book."
1,Post Office Messed Up,I am sure the product is nice..but considering the post office messed up I never received the backpack but Sportsmagic has been kind and is going to refund me my money since the item was a Christmas gift for my son.
3,Stanley QUICK SQUARE edges not level,I thought the quality of a product by Stanley would earn five stars by default. However this was not the case with the Stanley QUICK SQUARE Layout Tool. Two of the edges had a rough and uneven surface ( a casting issue). I had to very carefully sand the edges smooth and make them even. Really shouldn't have to do that to a tool that is is supposed to be accurate to start with. Pity.
5,Great buy,Have been looking for this piece for a while now. Well crafted piece. Perfect addition to our Christmas tree ornament collection.
5,Music from the heart,"I feel like the musicians of this CD don't just play the music, they are the music, they live it. And the music flows through my heart when I listen to it."
2,disappointing,"This set was very disappointing. I missed the part that there would be christmas music in here. I expected themes and music (Italian?) from ""mob-gangster"" movies, not some soundtracks that really seem unconnected to the theme. If you want to copy and edit these, I suppose it would be ok, but I just want to listen. If I had previewed the titles more carefully, I probably may not have purchased this set."
5,Buy One Tape from this Series and You'll Be Hooked!,"I discovered one earlier installment from this series last year and have been hooked ever since! I proudly own all six installments: 1) Praise In the House, 2) Worship in the House, 3) Shout in the House, 4) Word in the House, 5) Glory in the House, and now 6) Revival in the House. The good folks at my neighborhood Christian bookstore know to set aside my copies as soon as they arrive.My review is an endorsement of the entire ""...In The House"" series, as they are all equally empowering, uplifting, jazzy, hip while offering (consisently) reverence to our Lord Jesus Christ.I absolutely LOVE this presentation of Urban Praise music and recommend (and even buy extra copies--no dubbing!) to all my friends.Until the next installment, Kimberly Stansell, author Bootstrapper's Success Secrets: 151 Tactics for Building Your Business on a Shoestring Budget (Career Press)"
4,I'm happy this was available but...,"I am very happy that this CD was still available and in the original packaging and I was able to enjoy songs that inspire spiritual renewal as I did nearly 15 years ago; however, due to no fault of the company who was PROMPT in shipping this out, the sound was not as sharp and this was disappointing. I assumed that this problem was due to the age of the product (about 15 years old). I highly recommend the company that shipped this product."
5,Everyone should own this CD,"This CD is a must have for your collection. Every single is uplifting and full of praise and reverence to our most High God. Some will make you dance....others will make you drop to your knees, throw your hands up and worship Him. It's truly annointed. The first time I heard it I was hooked and have been playing it ever since (especially #12). Any born again believer will agree that this album is all you need for your own private praise and worship. If you only buy one CD....buy this one. I'm even buying more copies to give to friends."
5,Smooth and Satisfying,"When I first heard a snippet of this artwork I couldn't believe it wasn't synthesized. The sounds are utterly beautiful and of an unearthly style as one tone melts into another. All sounds are heard riding atop each other in wave after wave of reverbal bliss.My favorite part is the transition from track 3 to 4 where the gruff and dark sound of Dempster's solo Didjeridu performance, which conjures visions of shadows and dark caverns, segues into the uplifting and souring sounds of trombones that lift one up and out from underground into an azure sky.Many won't know what to make of this kind of music, but those of us who yearn for something truly spiritual, it satisfies with unwavering contentment."
5,THIS VIDEO IS GREAT!,"This video is fun, exciting and entertains the kids for hours. My boys are 5 and 3 and they love watching it. Can't wait till the next episodes come out."
2,Bourgeosie Black Folks Behaving Badly,"This book is definitely a page-turner, and it gets your attention, but not in a good way. The author sensationalizes shallow, tawdry behavior in this tale of affluent Black folks who are little more than social climbers and adulterers. When I was a broke college student, books like this provided a break from my bleak reality. Now that I'm out of school, a litle older and a lot wiser, I find little value in books like this. Vapid plots, superficial characters and wildly unrealistic situations just don't do it for me anymore.I was looking for a trashy summer beach read, and this is definitely that book. If you're expecting anything more you will be quite disappointed."
2,"Connie, Connie, Connie","P.G. County initially engaged me -- I was looking for a quick read, nothing too heavy. About two-thirds of the way into the book, I was disappointed, but still hooked by Jolene's antics, so I pushed on! The Candice and Lee storylines added little to the story and the conclusion seemed abrupt. I'm glad I checked this book out from the library rather than purchasing it. Jolene was too funny, so one dimensional, but I couldn't stop laughing at her antics to get the right man, the right house, the right life. I'd recommend this as a read only when someone has exhausted all of the ""must reads"" stacked on the your home bookshelves -- or if you stumble across it at your public library!! Don't buy it!!"
2,Disappointed,"I have read all of Connie Biscoe's books. They were getting better and better and then came P. G. County. I hated the book. It had no ""meat"" to it. To me, it was not a story. It was a book of chapters of people. Out of all the characters, not one, who could be considered a strong Black woman or a strong Black man. When I finished the book, my question was ""....and."" I believe P.G. County was a great disappointment to Connie Biscoe fan club, ""ME""."
2,REAL PEOPLE?,"Although this book reads along well and has all the required plot elements, the some of the characters are not believable.I have met woman like Pearl and girls like Lee. Maybe even a toned down version of Jolene. But Barbara? And Candice? A black woman that overlooks what happens in her own bed? A white woman who lives and works with black people and then reacts as if she was from a small town in Idaho when she encounters them closer than she anticipated? In the author's words, ""Puh-leez."""
2,All hyped up but went NOWHERE,"I was sadly disapointed in PG County by Connie Briscoe. I waited so long for her new book to come out. I had been reading excerpts on the book before the book actually came out. Ms. Briscoe, PLEASE. This was a nice attempt to come off as Dynasty, but it was also far fetched and her characters were totally unbelievable. They didn't even sound real. I like to read books that I can picture this story happening to me. I could not do that at all with PG County. And the sad part about the book is that even I could have written it. And I don't know the first thing about writing. I am a strong Connie Briscoe fan, but I think she needs to go back to the writing board with this one.One Disapointed Reader!"
3,"A Big, Hyped-Up Disappointment","The book was poorly developed throughout. The characters weren't fleshed out fully, but the kicker was that horrific ending. How can a book so deep in details and drama end like this one did? Ms. Briscoe, I have read all your books, but this one is the most disappointing."
3,page turner,"I've read all of Connie Brisco's books and was especially exited to read PG County, since this is where I've lived for over 25 years after moving from Washington DC. The book kept my interest and I'd consider it a page turner since I wanted to know what was going to happen next. However, I was very disappointed with the ending and felt like it just died after the climax. I would liked to have known how the characters made out after the peak of the story. But after the most exciting moment occurred in the book, it was all over in less than 5 pages. This disappointed me."
4,The Truth Hurts!,"The substance of the stroy was great. I really enjoyed this book and the changes that these so called wealthy people encountered. It proves that the only difference between rich and poor are the attitudes. These people may have lived in a rich part of town, however they are no different than those that live in the ""Hood"". It amazes me how people change once they get money which is sad. Overall, a great story and Connie you are an excellent writer. Congratulations my sister and keep up the good work."
4,Great read. It took me away.,"Thiw was a great read. I finished the book in practically a weekend. And for a mother with three kids at home over the holidays, that was spectacular. While the story, with all its thrilling drama, initially seemed simple on the surface, I found that by the end it was everything but that.This novel keeps you turning pages, and at the same time subtly plants some very moving messages about changes afoot in our culture during these unsettling times.We need more novels like this.I wish Connie all the best."
4,PG County,It was a very good novel. I enjoyed the characters and plot. I thought it was humorous at times.
2,Needs A New County Commissioner,"This story has been done a million times over and to take it on takes courage, especially if you intend to involve black folks and make it enjoyable and moreover, make it GOOD. This wasn't the best I've seen of Sister Briscoe's writing.I never cared about any of the characters, and the ending was just too Hollywood-ever after-nice and neat. Wonderful book for a diversion, but don't look for too much depth."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money on This One,"I finally got an opportunity to catch up on my reading. I'd searched several [local store] for a copy of PG County without success. While making an airline connection, I found and purchased a copy. I wish that I hadn't done either. This book was a complete waste of my precious bookreading time. The characters were boring, one-dimensional, and unrealistic. If you want to read a well-written novel, try Harlem Redux by Persia White. It's obvious that this author took the time to do her homework. You can envision Harlem of the 1920s through this author's eyes. It's a page turner that'll keep you on the edge of your seat."
4,Is there a Sequel?,"I read this book when it was first published. I thought it was a very good book. The end left me wondering if there is going to be a sequel. I hope so. There are some loose ends at the end of the story that should be tied up. Overall, it was a great read."
4,Quick Read,"I thought that Connie Briscoe did an excellent job with this book (characters, plot(s), climax,... It was a fast read and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.I enjoy reading books where the settings are familiar to me. It's nice to say ""Been there"" or ""I know where that is"".I believe that Lee's character/storyline could have been a bit better or just flat out eliminated.I was also a little disappointed in the ending of the book. I felt like there was more I needed to know before it actually ended."
3,Pretty good book,"I found this book to be entertaining and interesting but I have read other books that kept me more involved than this one. This is also the first book I have read by this author. I would certainly read more of her books but not the first choice at this time. Since I live near PG County is was interesting to see how she represented it. And the ""explicit sex"" wasn't as explicit as some romance novels I have read. Good book but definately library material."
3,Light Literary Entertainment,"Remember Robert Townsend's spoof soap opera skit entitled, ""The Bold, The Black, and The Beautiful""? Well, P.G. County is a longer version of that skit in written form. Though not the most noteworthy book from a pure literary perspective, the novel is very entertaining and would be good for anyone looking for something a little lighter in between more serious reads. The storyline and characters are 1 part Jerry Springer, 1 part Young and the Restless, with a dash of black bourgeoisie that make the book a page-turner and should spark some interesting discussions within your reading circle."
3,Soap Opera Material,"P G County was indeed a black soap opera. I found it intriguing to read about these people of ""higher status"". Funny how they are people too. Poor Barbara, oh so country that she could not figure out that she could have left that dog and taken just about everything he owned with her. I loved how Jolene ended up. She is the kind of chick I hate. Has so many self esteem issues developed from teenage years, now in her thirties with a mind to steal anybody's husband because of her own insecurities about herself. And had a good husband. She got exactly what she deserved. A big fabulous house and no man in it. And she can hardly afford it by herself--oh what a pity. And that story of the white woman trippin because she is 1/8th black. Good for her too!I read it very fast because I felt it was entertaining. Hopefully the sequel is even more dramatizing!!!"
3,In between,After reading PG County I found myself slightly disappointed and while reading it I found myself slightly entertained. PG County lacked that attention grabbing quality that you need when writing a novel. I think the main reason why I kept reading the book was because I live in the PG county area and I could some what relate.Over the story had a couple of exciting moments but they were short lived. The book was a good read and I recommend it to readers who like to read to kill time.I still love you Connie B.
2,Mama always said,"If you don't have anything nice to say keep your comments to yourself. But then who really listens to mama. This book had too much drama, I liked the author's style of writing but this book was a demoralizer for black women. The basis of the book was that you needed to stay with a man who treated you like crap to make it. Or sleep with whom ever you can to make it to the top. And spend well beyond your means. Not a book for someone with low self esteem. But plenty of drama for the soap opera fanatic."
1,My first and last Connie,"Yep, PG born and bred, a child of the 60s and 70s, when Suitland was still suburbia, not Compton! I finally checked the audio version out at my library. This book was unbelievable. Really - un (as in not) believable. As a native of the County, I must say I'm so disappointed. These characters were all caricatures. Totally empty! Candace and that story line was contrived and lame. Lee - whatever. I could tell where both those lines were headed almost right away. You knew Lee would end up in silver lake somehow. The inscription on the photo wrapped that up for me quick. I can't even convey how stupid I found the saga of Candace. Jolene had the most to offer, if anything. Not saying much there, though. And did these people ever go to the grocery store or their kids' schools? Sorry. I gave Ms. Briscoe a try. Will pass next time. Guess I'll go back to legal thrillers and murder mysteries. When it's all said and done, I'll always love my home - the real PG County."
2,As the world turns,This is an entertaining black soap opera that has predictable twists and turns. Don't expect to be mentally challenged only entertained.
3,Truley Just a Soap Opera,"This book was a soap opera with black charachters. If you like soaps and soap opera-like drama, read this book. The book really had no point--except to entertain--like soaps do. It was a page-turner and interesting soap opera-like things happened (at a party, one girl held someone hostage with a gun while making demands). It was OK as shallow entertainment."
2,Predictable.....................,"This was an all around bad story. Characters do things that have you thinking ""huh"". Makes no sense and parts are so predictable. Not interesting at all."
1,Cheap Production,"This film was made very cheaply and the acting is wooden and poor. I couldn't even watch it but maybe a quarter way through. Don't waste your money, even if it only costs a penny."
3,"Good, not great","Interesting in parts, but it didn't live up to the title. I found it to be more of an exploration of how dogs became domesticated over thousands of years, and the ways in which they differ from their wild brethren. There were some good insights, but overall I felt it was too ""clinical"", for lack of a better word. I much preferred the author's How To Speak Dog."
4,Interesting Look on Dogs,"This was a fun and rather fascinating study of dogs. I especially enjoyed the personality quiz that was included in the book. The anecdotes ranged from amusing to heart-breaking. The chapter on heroic dogs especially stood out. I thought it was a good balance between science and entertainment. There was a good deal on the domestication of dogs, which I think is interesting, though Coren did not mention co-evolution, which I found to be rather surprising. Still, I really enjoyed this!"
2,ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT NOT PROPER FIT,"I purchased 4 Oxygen sensors for the upper left & right, and lower left and lower right for my 2001 pathfinder a few weeks ago. The sensors for the upper left and right were delivered before the other 2 which arrived about a week later. I did not get a chance to have these replaced by the mechanic until a few days ago only to find out that the connectors for the lower left and lower right were totally different from the original ones. This I find kind of disheartening as the products states that these were ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT replacement. That is the reason for buying them in the first place and not the UNIVERSAL ones - ended up costing me and extra $50.00 to have the mechanic modify them. DISAPPOINTED."
3,A Home For Wolfling,"I gave this book three stars because parts were pretty boring. It kept me reading in the beginning and the end. I think it was a good book and I recomend it to people who like animals. When the book starts out Robbie Trent(a thirteen year-old boy) learns of a wolf den and wants a whelp for a pet. When they find the wolf den Robbie climbs into it and gets the whelp he wanted. His parents let him keep it and as time progresses the wolfling grows bigger and bigger. The book ends when Robbie, Wolf, and Inga (this girl he likes) live happily ever after."
1,It wouldn't work.,"I installed the game but then it asked me to get updates from the ""proxy sever"". I tried to get the updates but the next page in downloading the updates made wouldn't let me go on until I dowloaded them from its link. The link however wouldn't connect to anything and therefore I couldn't finish installing the game so I can't play it. I have five bars on my internet connection and since I'm writing this it must be working. However it wouldn't connect to the download site. Also the support links in the back would connect to anything except a suggestion that I try a differnt search which wouldn't work either. I wasted a whole day trying to get it to work but it won't work."
3,Nothing about Ultra and early computers,"I read this regular book, here in Brazil.This book was writen by american, general and later president Dwight Eisenhower.This book is at least regular, for today's standards, because it doesn't talks nothing, about some things linked to World War II:1-Has nothing about the computers that broked the Enigma code machine.Yes, ultra was classified, but we aren't in 1948.2-The terrible treatment to german POWs by Eisenhower's men, has no place in this book.Also this book has nothing about terrible famine imposed in Germany by USA,England,etc.3-The giving of hundreds of thousands of german POWs to Soviet Union, for slave labor has no place in this book.4-The failures of americans also, has no place in this book.Even so, this book remains at least regular, 60 years after to be published."
5,Dated but complete,"Following a visit to the Normandy battlefields, I was drawn to read Eisenhower's memoir, giving his first-hand account of the toimes and events. It did not disappoint. A great primary source for anyone seeking the story of the ""greatest generation"" and their effots to liberate Europe. A must read for any historian of the twentith century."
3,A bit bland,I had high hopes for this book but was a bit disappointed. I found the reading to be bland. I had trouble getting motivated to read the book quickly. I found only two chapters to be good reading - the one on planning Overlord; and the chapter about the Russian culture and mentality (and his dealings with the Russians after the war). The book is really about the logistics of running a war; planning invasions; dealing with prima donna personalities; and working around politics (with respect to how certain decisions/events will affect a country's policies/leadership). I think it's worth one read but I would not read it again.
5,buy it!,"This band has just generally rocked my socks. I discovered them several years ago. I have enjoyed their music since. Zesty!??! And yet relaxed. Some of the songs are haunting, some danceable. This band makes me want to slump into my beer."
3,Damaged CD case,"The cd was in great condition, but as to the cd case, was horrible was broken very badly. Cd still worked perfect, but the case not in a good condition at all."
3,"rambling, strange, plotless take on Thatcher's England","Rather than a story, this film is impressionistic, moving from scene to scene in random sequence with sudden sharp focus. The characters and acting - just look at the debut performances in the cast! - are extremely good, as are the comedic situations of the depressed unemployed going nowhere. Oldman is a dumb skinhead. Tim Roth is a dim-witted younger brother, devoid of ambition and self esteem; his older brother is a lazy cynic, also with no future. The father and mother despise them, yet do nothing to change anything. Molino is a long-suffering relative who works and is bored with his marriage to a rather nice alcoholic.While I am a fan of Mike Leigh, this early effort is clearly before he has honed his storytelling skills, who will become first rate in such films as Life is Sweet or Secrets and Lies. It is worth a look, but I would not recommend buying it."
4,"This should be a period piece - depressingly, it isn't.","Portentousness, contrivances and misogyny aside, this is a modernist masterpiece, closer to Antonioni than Loach. Leigh doesn't simply record the monumental, faceless, soulless tenements and urban environment that dwarf his characters, as a social-realist would: he allows them to shape his narrative, a rigid, static series of concrete tableaux. Leigh doesn't reduce his characters to caricature, as he's often accused of - Thatcherism does, by removing all those things (hope, work, dreams etc.) that mark humanity and individuality. As bitterly angry and funny as 'Naked'."
1,One Star for the DVD only,"Don't buy this DVD. The sound is bad. The dialect in Leigh's films can be hard enough for us Yanks without having it be virtually inaudible and painfully blotted out by the music. The mix of this DVD is really bad and it spoils the movie. That said, the movie is fantastic; too bad the DVD does it such an injustice."
1,Non-Working Disk,"The disk that came with the book is a data disk only, and does not contain the program that created the data. That is why the data disk is not a workable disk, unless you have The Medical Manager installed on your computer! The book is too geared to be used with the Medical Manager Software Program, and is difficult to read it as a stand alone book.Version 10.0 is in print now and comes with a CD-Rom which is suppose to have the complete software program and data files so it can be used as it should be, and teach medical billing and office proceedures.Janice"
4,Medical Manager review,"I am an instructor for the Medical Manager class and have been for over 5 years. I have used almost every version possible with the Medical Manager. This is a fairly good book for students to learn from. As long as the person reads the instructions and then looks at the exercises, they should have NO problems. However, if the person just looks at the exercise and does not read the material, they may have difficulty. Some of the exercise/pictures are different then the actual reading part but not too many. Overall this book makes it fairly simple to learn this program."
1,no stars - terrible,"I am forced to give at least one star in order to submit this review, however, the product should receive zero stars. This product was very outdated in the ever changing medical software industry. It was of no use and had to be returned. You should not be selling this product."
4,The taste is great when blended with others,"I mix this tea with Yogi Bedtime tea or Celestrial Seasons tea and it make a wonderfel treat to drink prior to going to bed. I really think that it helps me sleep. I have fibromyalgia and sometimes have a lot of trouble falling or staying asleep and when I drink my mix, I almost always fall asleep right away."
3,"This tea pulled up under ""Hops""","I was looking for hops tea and ended up ordering this tea. It is passion flower with a splash of hops. Hops tea is very deeply relaxing for me. This tea is nice to drink but doesn't, in my opinion create such a strong relaxation. If passion flower works for you, you will love it."
2,Not working for us,"This might have worked for some others, but neither the herbs (esp. mint and lemon) nor the fluid helped the sleep in our cases.I double checked the packaging material, the only ""clinical data"" is about another line of product from this company."
2,Gives me a minor headache...,"I tried to like this... It tastes great and it can give you a good nights rest. However, every time I take it I end up with a slight headache. It starts shortly after I take it and I can still feel it the next morning. It is only a minor headache, but a headache nonetheless. I was able to sleep through it. I recommend making a trip to your local grocery store and buying a single pack to try it out, instead of purchasing a pack of 6 from Amazon."
5,Best thing around to help with sleeplessness,"This tea is the absolute only thing that helps me get a good night sleep. Unlike drugs & even melatonin, there is no groggy effect in the morning. It is MUCH more effective than camomile for me. And it can be used every night indefinitely with no ill effects! If you suffer from sleep issues try this first."
2,awful,"i disliked this book because of the heroine i didn't like her at all, i thought she needed therapy ,she had issues she did not give the hero a chance to explain ,she just left while he was injured in hospital because some strange women told him she was carrying his child,i did not want them to get back together,the hero should have found somebody better."
4,Better than expected.,"This is the only heavy-magnet sealed mid-range 4"" I could find on Amazon, so I bought two.800hz free resonance and a 13khz rated high range mean this is not a mid-base producing part.I set a 6db crossover at 1500hz and it performs well at reasonably high volume with no distortion other than a nasty spike/pit at 3khz. That said, you can't HEAR that... It only shows up when analyzing the speaker.This was paired with a 10k 6db crossover piezo behind a 30 ohms parallel resistor and the combo creates a FLAT response. Good, solid design.If you need a 4"" for upper voice frequencies this will do what you want, do not hesitate to buy."
4,Proxxon Drill Stand,Haven't used it yet but it appears very well made. Better than the Dremel version.
2,Where is the Quality?,"The Brass guide bushing and assembly is a very sloppy fit resulting in about .25"" of play at the tool tip. I was hoping to use this in conjuction with the X-Y table to machine small parts and jewelry. Can't do it with this without mods. This item appeared to be very cheaply made and not of the quality I was expecting.Too bad because the X-Y table and Rotary Tool are really nice.I agree with a previous reviewer that;""To summarize, the QC is poor to non-existent, and the design is just plain quirky.I'd return it for another, but would not have hopes of finding the next one to be any better.""Don't expect that you can use this out of the box with their X-Y table to get the precision that you expect"
5,Excellent,"This episode, like ""The Immunity Syndrome"" or ""The Paradise Syndrome"" and others, has some great tension between Spock and McCoy. Very good. Spock is in command of the Enterprise for most of this one.The idea of spatial interphase is interesting as well. The Tholians are refreshingly alien (crystalline life forms!) and make good antagonists."
5,A classic,"Lewis at his best, tackling the issue of pain and Christianity and why the two must co-exist. Why pain is a gift from God and not punishment."
3,"C. S. Lewis, Not the Man You Think He Was","I thought the book was more than I expected,clearly revealing Lewis's views concerning the Bible. It surprised me in many ways as I did not know he was a Theistic evolutionist and that he did not necessarily accept the Genesis story as real thinking it might be aligorical.He presented different views on hell and spoke of a Christian's struggle in an interesting way."
2,Terrible editing here!,"I would love this book, but the Kindle edition is horrible! It's like they did a global search for ""its"" and replaced it with ""it's"" throughout the whole thing. ""It's"" unbelievably annoying."
5,Pain: A Spiritual Journey,"Punctuated with a thin veil of lyricism and argued from a Christian perspective, C. S. Lewis' book does not only explore the psychological ramifications of suffering in our lives. It also provides an intellectual discussion that aims at reconciling theological tenets concerning the role of God's love in human sorrow. Written many years before his beloved wife's death, the book is far from offering merely theoretical comments on suffering. In fact, it addresses common misconceptions about happiness and love, still within the parameters of deep empathy for the human condition in a world plagued with grief."
3,Painful reading,"Aside from novels, this is the first C.S. Lewis I have read. He is very deep and erudite. It is not a book meant for light reading. At times it was very difficult. But, in the long run, I believe I got the gist of the book's message."
3,Disappointing,"The problem is a real one, and Lewis brings considerable intellectual power to bear. But the result is disappointing. If his role is to ""justify the ways of God to man"", then in an intellectual sense he has succeeded to the extent of internal consistency. But his chapter on animal pain is chilling; if he had ever seen an animal in pain he could hardly have written so callously. His avowed fear of pain makes him intellectualize it to the vanishing point. This was an intensely human man, in some ways a noble man, but the humanity and nobility are missing and all that is left is the Oxford don. Read this, then read A Grief Observed, when he has to face the loss of his wife. That's the real book. That book gives the whole truth about the problem of pain. As he says in A Grief Observed, the cardplayers are right. if there's no money riding on the game, no one takes it seriously. The problem with The Problem of Pain is that Lewis had no money riding on the game when he wrote it."
5,Another brilliant book by C.S. Lewis,"Whether physical, emotional or spiritual, pain is an undeniably reality in this world. C.S. Lewis eloquently explores the pain we endure as humans, as well as the Christian response to it, in this wonderful book.I think many non-believers find pain to be a great deterrent against them accepting faith. They wonder how a loving God would possibly allow His children to suffer. This has never been a problem for me, although I have been fortunate to avoid devastating tragedy in my life. Lewis explains how pain is a product of the Fall, how through the Fall humans have become vulnerable to ""the laws of nature"", which they were not subject to before sin tarnished Man. Lewis also writes of animal suffering, the grim reality of Hell and he concludes with a vision of Heaven: ""But God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love""I would highly recommend this book to Christian and non-Christian."
4,Clarifying experience,"This book clarified many issues in my life and turned my God from One that was a bit of a stretch to fit into my everyday world, into a God which makes himself evident in every aspect of the earth, evil and pain included. I think this book frankly is a better apology for Christianity than Mere Christianity. Definitely a good introduction to the problem of pain, and the clearest exposition of the free-will defense I have read. C.S. Lewis deals with a concept lofty and philosophical in a manner that grips my attention and bolsters my faith. I recommend this book first above all Lewis' other books on theology."
5,My favorite Lewis book of all time,"A question which so often plagues us is what Lewis attempts to answer. His examples, as good as they have been in the past, have never been better, cornering us at every position, until we can't help but admit that he was right, even if we don't want to. And, when you read this book, as in so many others of his, you are surprised by the internal joy you feel which makes you never want to lose the memory of even the moment you are in.If you have the patience to re-read every page a few times, then get started as soon as possible; if not, then read Mere Christianity first to get an understanding of why people love this author so much, and then you'll know why it's worth going over each page several times."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book some time before I abandoned Christianity. I was looking for answers to some of the serious questions and doubts that are bound to come in any thinking Christian's life. My reaction to Lewis's arguments in this book were, ""Is this really the best we can do?"" I was deeply disappointed. I'd expected something a lot better and I was astonished at the poverty of Lewis's theodicy. If this is top-shelf apologetics, then apologetics is a poor field."
1,The Problem of Pain,If yout trying to figure out what the author is trying to say don't buy this book. Not an easy reader.
2,Poor quality,The pattern stretches out upon wearing and the graphic becomes unclear. Very high waisted. Not the product I was expecting.
4,Not opaque when stretched,"One thing that bothered me is that when it is stretched, the fabric is no longer opaque. Also, the tights are hand wash only. I would never buy something like that knowing what I know now."
2,Soft horsey,well it works decent enough but its a little cheap. The metal easily bends. But then again what do you expect for so cheap????
5,Bulova watch,"Hello!I'm happiest with this watch,looks elegant and beautiful with all the cloth.Thanks."
2,too basic,"get the Auriculotherapy Manual by Terry Oleson, much more practical for effective treatments. The Wexu book is too basic and not nearly as useful in my opinion."
2,A weak debut,"Olivia (or Oliver as she is known to her Greenwich Village friends) Brown is the kind of historical female sleuth that readers of this genre would love to love. Unfortunately, beyond telling us that this is 1920 Greenwich Village and the Prohibition puts a cramp in the artistic lifestyle, author Annette Meyers does little to evoke a true sense of place. The dialogue reads as very 1990s and I was surprised to read that a character attended a lecture by the famous woman rights advocate Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who died in 1902.The plot is also weak, centering on a case of obsession. I thought that the perpetrator was very obvious and that a young woman who had already been involved in some detective work would have pulled everything together much quicker.I may take a look at Meyers's planned sequel, but it will have to be a whole lot better for me to read the whole thing."
2,this book was boring and I hated it,"I had to read this book for english class. Before we read the book we read some notes about it and it sounded like a good book. After I read it though, I have to say it sucked. It was a long boring snooze fest. I'd have to say some praise is due but it was just too long, boring, descriptive to keep anybody's attention. I found that even if I read it slowly I couldn't retain any of it. Take my advice and don't read this book unless you absolutely have to."
1,this book is hard to understand as well as to read,i am a junior in high school and i do not reccomend this book to anyone
2,"Too much action, not enough plot!","I thought that the book had excellent description and imagry, but it lacked a story. The whole book was Henry wondering if he would run from a battle and weither or not anyone would notice his cowardice. I think that Crane's talent would be better utilized in poetry. This book was a big waste of his time."
1,i found this book boring and hard to concentrate on,"The author of this book spends sometimes will spend up to three paragraphs, describing something as insignificant as how the sunlight looks coming though his tent. This was an unuasually short book, and it seems to me that the book would have been 30 pages at a maximum if he did not go into such great mind numbing detail. I am in an 11th grade English class, and this book did not have difficult vocabulary, rather just details that could send a person to insanity. This might have been a great book for its time, but people must understand that kids these days do not have such a great interest in what goes on in a persons mind, while fleeing from a battle. I would not reccomend this book to anyone I know, in fact, i would have stopped reading it about 40 pages in to it, if I was not required to read it by my teacher."
4,Worth the effort,"Ben Jonson, although modern audiences find him difficult to read, played an important role in the development of the English comedic play. Volpone is a dark comedy that explores the twisted world of a con artist and his toady. The play demonstrates Jonson's awareness of the hypocrisy of social situations. Similarly, Bartholomew Fair takes the reader on a tour of the seamier side of seventeenth century London life. Zeal of the Land Busy, a religious hypocrite, still speaks to our generation when questions of religious expression still plague us. Epicene is a gender-bender in which the ideal silent woman turns out to be a man. The Alchemist, although the most difficult of the plays to read, is worth the effort, as it explores the questions of knowledge, ownership of knowledge, and abuse common in today's world."
5,WOW -what a great kitchen tool.,Perfect for when a leg of lamb -etc - does not fit in your biggest pot. Perfect- fast cuts- none of the mess from using a cleaver. Great addition to my kitchen.
3,Missing Piece,"The saw looks like it would be satisfactory for our intended occasional use. Unfortunately it arrived missing the small piece that attaches the blade to the end of the frame away from the handle. The packing did not appear to be damaged. I would be happy if I could get the piece sent to me. Apparently, however, my only recourse is to return the saw for a refund."
1,ineffective product,The saw is ergonomically awkward and proved ineffective as a tool to butcher an elk.
3,"OK text, poor pictures","I first found and read this book from our local library... it is a masterpiece to anyone interested in anthropology. Although the cost was about $78, I decided that I had to own it and bought a new copy. The new edition I received was certainly new and clean, but the print was not quite of the quality that the library edition had. The B&W photographs/plates of the library edition were high quality, glossy prints; whereas, this new edition has disparagingly mediocre reproductions of them."
3,Bad binding,"My review is not on Coon's work itself, but on the quality of the binding offered here.For the money, I feel the book should be of higher quality. The paper is cheap; the book is overly bulky for its dimensions; and, in consequence, it's clumsy to hold and because it's so thick, the left-hand-side pages become difficult to read the deeper into the tome you get. For $70, one should expect better quality - a bigger, better-bound edition."
2,Amazon Offering NOT the Original Edition with High Quality Pictures,"Although very rare in print, this offering by Amazon is indeed the same masterpiece of anthropological research penned by Carleton S Coon, and it's certainly new and clean, but it is NOT the original edition with high quality, glossy B&W; photographs/plates like the original edition still found in many public libraries.The B&W; photographs/plates of the original edition were high quality, glossy prints, whereas, this new edition has only mediocre, margainally-acceptable reproductions of them. The print of this edition is not the same high quality as the original edition either.This work is available online for free download and the pics online are of the same high quality as the original edition. This edition is a $[...] offering, three times that of its value, but if you, like me, are glad to find it still in hard-cover print at all, it will suffice as an addition to your personal reference library."
3,Flat Glass Analysis,This is the source of Randall Moir's window glass analysis method that is most easily accessed.
5,A definite keeper but why Amazon...,is selling it for such a high price? It's $33.99 on Finis Jhung's website. This DVD is a must-have for correcting poor postures too.
3,It was alright,"Finis Jhung knows his stuff and right off the bat he shows you exercises to strengthen your muscles to be able to positions correctly. He's very knowledgeable however I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the video. It appeared to be more of a home movie and I felt I paid too much for what I got. I also expected him to demonstrate the positions of the feet in the beginning, but he didn't. I think that having some previous knowledge about the first positions would help a bit too. Overall it's an ok DVD for someone who is new to ballet but doesn't have the time or money to participate in live classes."
2,"Yes, no Christopher Cazenove in this","I too, finally watched this and to my horror I was seeing Anthony Andrews instead of Christopher. I guess dont judge anything on amazon by its cover!!!! Anthony Andrews is a good actor...dramatically, but he can't do comedy. Thank goodness when this actually was on series TV , Christopher took over.. This just made me realize even more how much I miss him. He passed away last year, very untimely. Too sad."
4,Good Coverage of Both Batch Files and WSH,"Although not as detailed as ""Windows NT Shell Scripting"" or ""Windows Scripting Secrets"" are--where each technology's abilities are concerned--it does goes into great detail in the area of command-line utilities included with Windows 2000 and the ""Windows 2000 Resource Kit"", showing you how to make use of them in scripts.It also explains how to set up your system to run scripts directly from the command line without typing a path or file extension, so that your scripts execute exactly like internal shell commands.It's a very useful reference for shell commands as well as scripting in general."
5,Educational and fun to read!,"There are 18 books in the lessons from the Hundred-Acre-Wood series. All of them are educational, colorful and fun to read!"
4,Food For The News Junky,"EXTRA is published bimonthly by FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting, Inc.). Sample article titles in the current issue (June 2004) are ""How Public is Public Radio""? and ""Nafta's Hung Jury."" The magazine offers criticism of media bias and censorship. The favorite targets seem to be members of the media elite such as Rush Limbaugh, Ted Koppel and Bill O'Reilly as well as leading newspapers including the WASHINGTON POST, NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY and LOS ANGELES TIMES. Attention is also paid to all major TV and radio outlets. The internet so far gets scant mention.In order to fully appreciate EXTRA it helps if you are a news junky. I think I qualify on that score but I am probably somewhat to the right of the editors of this publication. It appears to me that EXTRA has a decidedly liberal slant. That judgement no doubt in influenced by my vantage point."
1,don't send as a gift,It has a tag on it that is bigger than the charm that says Made in China. Probably worth about 3 dollars not anywhere near the listed price.
4,Grown Up,"Trina has most def grown up. I loved her last cd, but this one has a different kinda vibe to it. You go girl."
4,she's hot!,"Oh man! Trina is so hot!I'm not that sure about her rap skills (she would do much better) but even this is ok. So girl, work on it hard, give us a new great music and stay hot as you are!"
3,I bought this and sorta liked it.,"Whoa the sound comin off this cd is way way diffrent than the original, the beats are better , the apperances are better theres still alot of them though, the lyrics are ovrall better in most places, my fav songs are br riight, re3wind that back, u and me, ladies first, and kandi overall a hot cd but not hot enough"
1,hellish influince,It is sad that many sisters are Lost from this sexual immoral life styal if only they would repent from there iniquities and ask the the Lord for forgiviness so that thay may be saved from the Wrath to come-REJECT CHRIST AND U'LL REGRET IT
3,Decent,"This is a decent album, Trina has never claimed to be a powerful lyricist and she gets by on looks, packaging and decent beats. Unfortunately, her album came out the same day as EVE and that was a bad move. I still like Trina but I don't think she's serious about Hip Hop and making good music. I think she's serious about the entertainment industry and making money."
3,OK,"I really like her as an artist overall, but I was not a huge fan of this CD - there were a few tracks that she laid out that I liked, but overall I feel she has more to offer us that what she put onto this...I am still a fan, and will look forward to better material from her in the future. She's going to be around a while!"
2,shes aint no J.LO !!!!!!!!,this cd is horrible she doesnt even sound good and shes talkin on how shes better than J.LO ... excuse me J.LO is puerto rican J.LO is a singer song writer dancer actress model clothing designer fragrances designer resturant owner productions comapany owner i mean come on and J.LO has a real ... ...... this cd is GARBAGE so b4 u guys even think about it think twice shes not all that .......
5,One of my favorite books!,"This is one of my all-time favorite Holt books. I loved the creepy setting, the entire plot, the haunting legends, and the hero. I can never look at an old crumbling ruin now without thinking of this book. A must-read!"
2,Not Holt's best work,"Victoria Holt really knows how to spin a yarn, and I've really enjoyed her other books. This one clips along and has some interesting plots turns, but you never really respect the main character, Cordelia, because of her attraction to a man who doesn't exhibit a great deal of solid character, and in fact in one scene attempts to rape her. At the end of the book I felt like her life would go downhill from there. Also, I guessed the keys to the mystery very early in the book."
3,Science Art Book,I got my produce withi in a certain amount of time and was very pleased with the conditions of the book. Thank you
4,Amazing book! Needs answer key.,"The book is great, and the exercises are very well done! My only problem with it was that I there was no answer key available for the second edition which was very important for my purposes. The third edition does not have this issue and should strongly be considered!"
5,english grammer,"The book is really helpful.i bought this book for my sister, she has tried all different types and versions of the grammar books,so far this one is very easy to use"
1,It doesn't work,Real language is acquired through comprehensible input (see books by Krashen). All this book will do is help you take grammar tests. It will not improve real spoken or written language.
5,Excelent book,Excelent book I need it for my sister son that is using it and he told me it easy to understand the book.
3,Find a better edition.,"This reprint edition is only the second volume of a larger work of the same title, published in 1911 by the Lewis Publishing Co in NY and Chicago.This book contains pages 657 - 1168 of the original, a collection of disparate family memoirs, by no means comprehensive.Most unhelpful is the lack of any table of contents or index.If you can find a better annotated edition of this book then buy it. This one is not particularly useful."
2,Genealogy,I didn't find the book helpful. Probably because it didn't cover what I was looking for. It is historical and has significance only for reading. I didn't get much out of it.
5,Pirates Dice,This is a fun game. Better with four players. We first played this on New Years Eve and had trouble finding the game because it was so popular and sold out everywhere. Its easy to learn and fun for parties.
5,Fun Game!,This is a fun game to play. It is easy to learn as well. The plastic cups are durable and the textures are a neat added touch.
4,Lots of fun!,"Everybody that has played this game has thoroughly enjoyed it. The kids love it. Fun, quick and easy to learn. Very happy with it."
4,Counting/Dice/Chance game for fun Friday Family Game Nights!,We already had 4 cups and dice but wanted to include all the aunts/uncles/cousins friends who wanted to play! We now have enough for twelve! It's a blast!
4,Pirates Dice game a fun bluff,"The Pirates of the Caribbean Dice Game is fun and entertaining. Worth the money. Simple, but the element of bluffing is it's focus, and makes for a fun diversion."
4,PYSCH 1 UCSB,"I purchased this book for my intro to pysch class for my summer school class at UCSB. It is a pretty good deal compared to the one at my school $150. I asked my professor if this is the correct one and she said yes I was just missing 2 short stories which I just copied from my friends' books! Also, I purchased the one that was in great condition and it was actually in great condition. It just had some parts that were highlighted which I did not mind because the highlighted parts were actually the main idea so it made studying/reading a lot easier and faster for me! Hopefully if you get lucky you'll get a book that's been highlighted."
3,Book is OK,"This book is ok, but I can't really rate it that high. I mean, come on, its an intro to psych book."
1,Books,"Ordering from them is not a good experience. It takes forever to get your book, and when you try to get in contact with them, they take forever to respond to you. If you are thinking about ordering a college text from them I would suggest going to someone else."
3,Poorly written,"Very poorly and unprofessionally written. Several comments throughout the book are inappropriate and irrelevant (an attempt to keep the reader's interest i assume, but it just turned me off to this book). Too often, the author gives personal opinions rather than an unbiased approach to the subject. Several graphs are labeled incorrectly depending on the edition (switches back and forth labeling confidence interval for 2 standard deviations as 95% and 96%). Later chapters seem less biased than early chapters. Correlation coefficient is poorly explained, and not quite correct. If you absolutely need this book for class, save yourself some money and buy an older edition. Chapters don't seem to be too different among editions."
3,Meets the standard,"Thank you for the book, not only was it a great price, it is very useful. The only bad thing that I have to say about it is that the book is an instructor book. I could read the words that were torn off."
5,book purchase review,"very easy purchase, arrived on time. its a freakin college textbook, what the hell more can i say about it. i plan to sell it back when the class finishes."
3,It's comfortable,"I bought this bra when it was on sale, about $5. I would say the quality suits that price. If more than that, it's not worthy to buy. After one wash in the machine, the cups are out of shape but it will go back to it's original shape after I shaped it back. So after every wash, I need to reshape it. It's comfortable though, the padding is not too thick or too thin. It's just right for me. Other than that, you might want to buy one size bigger. The cup size is ok but the length is a bit too tight for me compared to other brand with the same size. May be after a few wash it will become loose?"
4,Fantastic approach to public speaking,"Great book! After reading it, I was able to really focus on the moment and how to effectively taylor my body language to fit my verbal skills in order to deliver the right message."
1,this stinks!!!,this toy barely reflected the blue shade and after about 2 hours IT BROKE!!!!!I HATED IT!!!Even the easy bake oven is better than this!!!!
3,An okay thriller.,"This was a made-for-TV movie. So you can't really expect too much. It was all right. Nothing great, but it works for a decent thriller. It start Judge Reinhold, Timothy Busfield, and Penelope Anne Miller. Basically, there's a killer implanting explosives into pacemakers. Miller is a surgeon with a shady past, Reinhold is the cop trying to stop this and Busfield is the killer. I'd say, if you can find it for a reasonable price go for it, but don't spend too much on it. It's the kind of movie I'd call a lazy Sunday movie. Kill some time, but that's about it."
4,Different Cynsters Book,"I've enjoyed all of Stephanie Laurens' Cynsters and can't wait for the next one. This was a good story about Chillingworth and his Lady love, Fransceca. Chillingworth was somewhat cold toward his love not like the other Cynsters at all, except maybe Demon in A Rogue's Proposal, which is one of the reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5! But still a very good book! The ending was great!!!"
3,All About Passion,"Laurens storyline held my attention, however it wasn't as good as 'Devils Bride.' Laurens stories are quite predictable, but if you want to forget the outside world for a while and indulge in pure romance then they are a jolly good read."
4,Lusty,"There arn't many books I don't finish but this is one, not because the writing is bad, this author is a master at what she does and the plot is good just too much sexual detail for my taste. I like more outside the bedroom narrative and some things left to the imagination. Still Lauren's is talented with what she pens and you might find the novel highly entertaining.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
1,Totally predictable drivel !,"I have not quit a book halfway through in years and years, but this one I did - after getting tired of skipping the innumerable sexual trysts. Actually, I found there were some bits of plot between the various sexual acts in various places. I have nothing against sex, but a little substance is required as well. This was my first Stephanie Laurens book, and will be my last."
3,Sad case of personality loss,"Gyles Rawlings, Earl of Chillingworth, appeared in Laurens' earlier Cynster novels (especially Gabriel's story, A Secret Love) as a delightful man with a truly sly and wicked sense of humor -- and no objection whatsoever to marrying a woman he liked and whose company and wit he enjoyed. Unfortunately, he was elected an honorary Cynster, which apparently resulted in a personality amputation, because none of his charm carried over into the book dedicated to his own romance. He shows up with a paralyzing determination to have a bloodless, conventional, marriage but otherwise blah.This is really too bad. The heroine deserved better treatment from her author."
4,Chillingworth falls hard!,This was the first of the Bar Cynster series that I read. After reading this book I read all of the other books in the series. I enjoy Stephanie Laurens characters and their committment to home and family. She writes these sensual stories filled with believable characters.Keep up the good work!
3,He's no Cynster but..,"Compared to all the other Cynster Chillingworth was a child. The book did lack in story and character. Hardly any motivation, but I did happen to like Francesca. She was great. She saw what she wanted and fought for what she knew was there. She to me was more of a Cynster. And I agree with another reviewer who said that Chillingworth had no motive for not being able to love. A good read if you're looking for good love scenes, otherwise you might want to skip it and what for ""The Promise in a Kiss."""
2,glorified pornography,"I read this author for the first time recently, and was encouraged to buy a second book, this one. I'm no prude, but in this ""romance"" the story was a distant second to an excessive amount of soft pornography. I resent having wasted the purchase price. If the sex adds to the story fine, but if it is the story then let the buyer know up front."
3,not as good!,"I do not agree this boook be given 5 stars. Although I admit the story suit the title. However, the story line is quiet boring. The sparks actually worn off... for me it is. The bedroom scenes are passionate, but it is just that. I honestly don't know how the hero and heroine could develop that kind of realtionship.. especially in the 18th century. Odd..."
2,Terrible,"My last Laurens book.Standards re-hash of the tired old Cynster novel. I did not even finish the book it was that bad. Mystery plot was as transparent as a window and the ending entirely contrived.Laurens either needs to change her template or just hope that her readership is not filled with people who read more than one book of hers.One star was for actually getting an editor to release this book to the public, second star was for having less than the normal amount of typos and also the overall legibility of the novel."
2,All About Pepto Bismol.,"I will only ask this question once: Could somebody PLEASE write a good romance novel that has a good plot and doesn't contain page after page of an unappealing couple practicing the Kama Sutra? I was ready to give up on this book after so many pages of ""tangling tongues"" and so on until somebody was obviously trying to kill Francesca. Now THAT caught my attention. Unfortunately, it was only her goofy cousin whom Gyles had at first mistaken for his betrothed, proving to be a huge waste of time. I do not like weak romance novels and, unfortunately, this is another one of them. If you want a good romance novel that isn't offensive and is completely engaging, try Pig in a Park by Pauline Baird Jones."
2,All about being bored!!,"I have never submitted a review, but this book was such a disappointment I felt the need to. I've read all the other ""Cynster"" books and thoroughly enjoyed them. As I started the book, I kept reading thinking that the story would pick up and it would get better. As time went on it became a real struggle to ""make myself"" finish the book. It was long and lacked much of a story."
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!,"I loved this book! I picked it up at the library not really expecting to enjoy it too much (it wasn't, after all, about the Cynster men). Even after reading a few pages, I almost just put it down. I am so glad I kept reading. This is by far one of my favorites by Stephanie Laurens (The Promise in a Kiss is my all-time favorite).I enjoyed seeing the married life of Gyles & Francesca, not just the ""courting period"" like the other books. I loved that we got to see Gyles fall in love with Francesca & that he had an actual reason for not wanting to admit & succomb to that love. Francesca was wonderful herione, strong, passionate, loving, intelligent & Gyles was just as wonderful. I truly enjoyed reading this book & watching these two fall in love."
4,All About Passion,Working my way through the Cynsters. I have the titles listed so I can catch them in order. Stephanie Laurens doesn't disappoint.
5,One of the best of the series so far.,"This book ranks up there with Devil, Demon and Gabriel's stories. Those were the best of the Bar Cynster Series I think. While not a real Cynster, Chillingworth was an honorary Cynster and had many of the same tendancies. I loved his parts in the other books and was so glad he got a story of his own. The thing I loved about this book was that the intrigue was secondary to the love story, and oh what a love story it was. One of the best. Gyles's resistance was not silly or overblown, you could really feel his struggle to let go and to let himself love. And Francesca is by far my favorite heroine out of the series. She's just different. She's not about to deny her passion, but she's also not going to force a man to do what he doesn't want to do. Way to go Stephanie, another great read!!"
5,Can't Do Without It,"I started shaving in the shower when I was in my early 20s. I grew a beard in my late 20s and I am now 43. Granted I don't have to ""shave"" but as I've gotten older, shave oil helps tremendously on the neck and cheek line. I tell young bucks to purchase a shower mirror and a good pre-shave oil and dispense with shaving at the sink. SHAVE IN THE SHOWER. I'm bearded and that is what I do. This pre-shave oil is tremendous and all I shave is my neck line and cheeks - I am certain that for men who don't have beards that this product would serve them very well."
4,Expensive but lasts,"This pre shave oil is actually a good value if you consider its viscosity compared to cheaper oils...it lasts longer, as well. The bottle prevents dripping and it works well on sensitive skin vs. using no oil at all. I have tried cheaper oils but returned to this one after mediocre results."
2,Art of Shaving - Lemon Pre-Shave Oil,"Art of Shaving Pre-shave oil works fine but is very very oily... I'm not a fan... One could use olive oil or something similar and the result would be the same. Art of Shaving Soap and Post Shave Balm on the other hand are excellent, however the Pre-shave is sub-standard to other products. Once you apply the Pre-shave oil, your hands and face are coated in oil which is tough to remove even with soap.As an alternative, I use the Kiehl's Pre-Shave which allows the face to be slick but not oily so that your shave is smooth. I should note, that Kiehl's shave cream is very much lacking compared to Art of Shaving."
1,not the jack black you're thinking of...,Don't get confused thinking this is Jack Black of Tenacious D and High Fidelity etc. - it's not. Luckily I didn't buy the album and find that out afterwards. I merely listened to the samples on here. So don't be fooled and waste your money!
3,It's not the school of rock guy but........,"I don't base an albums merits solely on the drumming or what star is the frontman (see reviews below for the reason I make that comment). This is a decent album of punky hard rock/metal released before the more popular man with same name was ever a consideration in any of this. The music is good hard rock in the vein of Gluecifer with a singer that sounds a bit like Glenn Danzig. The album is a mish-mash of mostly uptempo hard American rock n roll bordering on metal. If you like Gluecifer you'll like this if you aren't too put off that they sound so similar. If you are looking for the Tenacious D guy, try elsewhere."
5,different. good humor. great book!,"This is fantastic for anyone planning a trip to London town, it really helps you make the most of London. All the places a normal tourist just will not find are in this neat book and its not like other guidebooks we have used. If you are going to London buy this book and see the best of this great city."
2,Busted Flush (Apologies to McGee and MacDonald),"Carl Hiassen's earliest thriller/farces (Native Tongues, Tourist Season, Skin Tight, Double Whammy) rolled along at breakneck speed as he tried to stay ahead of South Florida's craziness. Over time his environmental message has intruded further and further and the plots have grown thinner and thinner. Flush is little more than an environmental fable, a treatment for ""Dora the Explorer.""I support sound environmental practices and do so with donations to the appropriate organizations. I support Dora the Explorer (at least my three-year-old does). I cannot support green fairy tales written by a professed admirer of John D. MacDonald.This book should carry a cover sticker noting that it is a ""chapter book"" for prepubescents."
4,Great family trip book,I enjoyed the book. It is very family friendly. Also has a good message to boot.
2,Flush,"A great story about the conflict between the environment and the economy. Also, a great story about what is right and wrong.When a major casino boat is sunk by an environmental fanatic it only leads to trouble for this family. With the dad in jail and the mom ready to file for divorce the kids must do something to show how the dads actions were right. A risky plan to sabatoge the once sunken Coral Queen is taken in to action trouble and environmental protection is all that follows. A great book to ""Flush"" into your library"
1,Author phoned it in. His writings have gone down hill.,I expected more from this author. His books have steadily gone down hill. I hope he is laughing all the way to the bank. If he or his editors thought this was a good book then they need some help. The book was not funny and no one could believe the plot. I want a refund.
5,I <3 CARL HIAASEN!!!!!,"All of his books rock ! Can't wait to read Chomp! GREAT for nature lovers.""All I have to do is Flush?"""
2,Flush,I liked this book but it does contain a few swears so I don't think you should be 10 to read it.
3,Erica's Review,"This was an excellent book , with a great story line, that doesn't keep you guessing but definately keeps you at the edge of your seat.Flush is about a boy named Noah , and the things he has to put up with , because of his father Paine ( who can be a real Pain ) who sunk the Coral Queen a casino boat who has been dumping human waste into the ocean. This is not only disgusting, but really unhealthy for ocean life and people. But no one believed Noah's father when he told them the reason he sunk the Coral Queen. He was actually put in jail. So Now Noah has taken it into his own hands to prove his father right. It's amazing what he gets himself into, and how far he is willing to go.This is a great realistic Fiction book for middle school boys, because the book is told from a boy's point of view and has that boyish humor to it."
4,"cornwall,Ny sixth grader","The book I read for my book report was Flush. Out of 10 stares I would give it a 9. This book by Carl Hiaasen has some action in it. I would recommend this book to people who like interesting stories and action stories.Now I will give a summery of this book. This book is about a boy named Noah and his sister Abbey. There father is in jail for sinking a boat called the Coral Queen. There main subject is to try and get him out. But he only sunk the boat because they were dumping swage in the water. Noah and Abbey will do anything for proof. Even sell there favorite boat to lice, who is a big jerk. But there also worried for there mom. She keeps on bringing up the word divorce. At one point he gets out of jail, but you have to read the rest to see what happens next.In my conclusion I think you should read this book. There is action and maybe even murder. This book has a lot of twists and turns to it. If I liked it I think you will to!!"
4,Flush,"FlushBy Carl HiaasenMysteryFlush is about a 13 year old boy named Noah, whose dad has just gotten arrested from sinking a gambling ship, and putting it out of business. Dusty Muleman, the owner, wants him to go to an anger management class. But Noah doesn't believe his dad is crazy. What could have really happened. Noah's dad accused him of dumping the boat's sewage into the ocean, but can Noah and his 11 year old sister Abbey prove what really happened.Flush relates to my life, because I have a sister, but her name isn't Abbey, who is cool sometimes, but sometimes she just gets on my nerves. My dad is also kind of crazy, but he wouldn't sink a ship would he?Carl Hiaasen's writing is amazing, because you never get left behind. You are right alongside the hero of the story the whole time.I loved this book, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I thought the story was kind of weird. Weird but believable.I can't exactly recall any books that relate to Flush, it's one of a kind."
2,Disappointed.,"I was disappointed, as I generally like Carl Hiassin. The book really drug on with lots of un-funny toilet jokes. It was too much like several other books of his that I've read, seems he has a formula."
4,"Flush, review by 5th Grade Dude","This book is honestly great. I've also read Hoot by Carl Hiaasen.(Great book by the way) That's what made me want to read this. It was a little cheezy though. Some of these things would not happen. And his dad made some dumb decisions. But, other than that, it was an exiting mystery that makes you want to read ahead."
4,Flush,"Who would have thought to use a toilet to take down a multi-millionaire? Noah Underwood, that's who. He had to do something desperate since his dad had been caught sinking the Coral Queen, and the toilet was just the answer. Dusty Muleman, owner of the casino found on the Coral Queen, is a shady character who only cares about money. Noah's dad is a crazy man at times, but he believes that Dusty is dumping human waste into the ocean. This angers him to point of sinking the Coral Queen. Noah gets caught in this environmental fight and decides to help take down Dusty Muleman despite the risk of getting caught or even worse. This all takes place in the second children's literature novel by Carl Hiaasen. Once again, Hiaasen uses his surprise attacks to shock you and make you want to turn the next page. Don't flush this one down the drain."
5,blown away,This book was one of the best books ever. Caral Haiaasen real described the situation. I loved the part when noah and his sister sneak on to the Coral Queen and foil the boat owners plan to keep on dumping suage in to the river. This book was amazing and everyone should read it.
5,Flush-One Heck of a Book by Brad N.,"In the book ""Flush"", the owner of a gambling ship, the Coral Queen, isn't putting waste from the ship's holding tank into a sewage tank-he's dumping it in the ocean, harming the local marine life. Noah Underwood's father tried to sink the Coral Queen because of the crime its owner is commiting, but was caught and arrested.After his dad was arrested, Noah decided that he would stop the Coral Queen's ownerfrom dumping waste into the ocean. With the help of his sister Abbey and a bartender from the Coral Queen, Noah would put an end to the crime."
4,Flush is good fun,"Maybe not quite as festive as Hiaasen's ""Hoot,"" but still a darn good read. As always, Hiaasen sketches great characters, and it's fun to see kids with the same sort of subversive nobility with which he writes adults. It's a fun plot, and how can kids not enjoy a story that involves sewage?I'm in my forties, but I enjoy good juvenile literature, and I'm happy to recommend this one. I purchased it for my nephew and will happily recommend it for other kids."
5,A FUN READ ABOUT A SERIOUS SUBJECT! GREAT JOB!,"I love to read (and to write) children's books. I think they're much more creative and original than adult books, and FLUSH is no exception. What an imagination this talented author has.I especially like his kooky characters, their sassy dialogue, and that Hiaasen tackles a serious issue like the environment in a clever way that teaches children without preaching ... and makes them laugh all along the way.I may be going about this backwards, but I read FLUSH first; now I'm going back to read HOOT! After reading FLUSH, there's nothing else I can do but read HOOT. I'm hooked on Hiaasen.Fantastic!"
1,Flush this one,"Absolutely awful. I have read all of Hiaasen's previous books and always enjoyed them. They aren't great masterpieces, but they were always amusing. I think Hiaasen phoned this one in. I could spend an hour telling you how stupid this book is, but I won't waste my time. I advise everyone not to waste their time reading it."
1,not entirely appropriate language for a 5th grader,Too many curse words and adult references. My 10.5 year old daughter did not care much for details on a bar fight and bad words-we are returning it.
4,Flush by Carl Hiassen -- good read,"I love all of his books and this was no exception. Good storyline, never boring, great visualization. I thought this one was maybe a little ""short"". I prefer a more lengthy book, but then again, Hiassen always leaves me wanting more."
4,Moves Quickly,"This is the story of Noah, a Florida boy whose father is in jail for having sunk a casino ship which was pumping raw sewage into the harbor. The casino boat is brought back to the surface, and nobody believe's Noah's father, so it's up to Noah and a small assortment of kids and adults to prove that, Yes, the casino boat owners ARE pumping raw sewage into the harbor. An enjoyable read, with empathetic characters."
4,sewage and hijinx in the Florida Keys; fun stuff!,"'Flush' is a very enjoyable, ""mystery-light"" novel that transports the reader to the Florida Keys and are entertained by some shenanigans encountered by a couple of young teens and their too-good-for-his-own-good father. The crime is pretty straightforward: casino ship dumps in waste into the pristine waters of a local bay and beach. It is up to our heroes to come up with creative ways to get the bad guys caught. They get help from some colorful locals, and it helps that the bad guys aren't terribly bright!Hiaasen has inserted all his positive literary qualities into 'Flush'. It is funny, it has a few plot twists, and the characters are either endearing or very much ""out there"". I especially enjoy how Hiaasen lovingly portrays life down in the Keys.Bottom line: one of the few books targeted towards young adults that is sure to please grown-ups too. Recommended."
3,"Flush, a big dissapointment","M.E. Flush by Carl Hiaasen is a story about a boy named Noah whose father sinks a casino boat called the Coral Queen because he believes that it is dumping sewage in the water. Noah needs to prove that his father is not crazy and correct about the sewage being dumped in the water. I gave this book 3 out of 5 because I thought the book was a little cheesy and the characters personalities aren't very complex. The book also had a very weak plot that was not very complex. I usually enjoy realistic fiction booksBut I didn't really enjoy this book. After reading Hoot another book by Carl Hiaasen I had very high expectations for this book. I think Flush was a big disappointment. I think children that are maybe 9 or 10 years old would enjoy this book. I would not recommend this book to older kids, young adults and adults."
3,Entertaining and fun for kids 9/10 and up,"Well, this was just a plain fun read. I think young readers (10 and up) would easily be hooked by the story and characters. The writing style is easy and natural, and full of humor too. Kids will love the blend of exciting action, funny lines, and interesting plot.Now, as an adult reader, I had a problem with the believability of the storyline...I mean, the novel is meant to be 'realistic' fiction, right? But regardless of my issues with the events of the story, I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to recommend this one to kids who are looking for a fun and action-packed read."
4,Good Story,"My nephew really enjoyed reading this book. Trying to get him to read is very hard but once he started reading it, he couldn't put the book down."
2,Blah Pablum,"I'm usually enthralled and entertained by Hiaasen's books, but he really missed the mark on this one. Dull characters, no humor, just blah."
3,This is a pretty good book,"The book I read is called Flush and it's about this kid who try's to get his father out of jail. His father went to jailby sinking a casino boat which was polluting the water. So the kid is trying to prove that the boat is one that is polluting it. This book is kind of a boring book because it takes a long time to get to the climax in this book. The climax is end of the bookie would maybe recommended this book if your a person who likes action, I wouldn't get this book. If you like mystery, buy this book. You choose. I also think this book is a cliffhanger because you want to know if the person will get arrested for polluting or the kid will go to kid jail for destroying the boat again. But they might even win the battle and the war."
4,Required reading,this was purchased as required reading for our 8th grader in Middle Magnet school. He really loved reading it and it kept his interest till the end.
4,Flush - Summer Reading,"This book is about a man named Mr. Underwood. Another man named Dusty Muleman is dumping waste into the local water. Mr. Underwood tries to stop Dusty from dumping waste into the water. Mr. Underwood sinks Dusty's gambling boat, The Coral Queen. He does this by pulling the plug out of the back of the boat. He does this to make sure he didn't damage the boat but still sink it. Mr Underwood goes to jail for sinking Dusty's boat. His children, Noah and Abbey, visit him at jail a lot. They also try to prove that Dusty Muleman is a bad guy for dumping his waste into the water. Noah and Abbey and a friend come up with a good idea to prove Dusty is dumping his waste int he water.This is a really good book. My favorite part was when Dusty Muleman was BUSTED!!!!!"
3,Good read but not your typical Hiaasen,I should have read the description a little better. This is a book for young adults and teens. Much milder fare than the typical Hiaasen novel.
3,looks nice,"Looks very nice and drawer went together well, but...as far as fitting it into the tower it did not go as well. I could not use the markings on the side and learned that it was better to use the up/down holes rather than the fixed or side to side holes. It took quite a bit of manuvering to get them to fit. MAKE SURE YOUR TOWER IS SQUARE! One of my towers was not and I really had to jimmy-rig the drawer to get it to fit (shims, pulling and pushing the whole 9 yards). Looks really nice once everything got put together and I like the look so much better than laminate or those crappy wire shelves."
2,had to return,"I purchased these drawers, but had to return them because they did not fit the basic shelving kit that I had bought. They stuck out. Nice quality and beautiful, just the description lead me to think they would work with the closet unit I had (also John Louis)."
3,Wanting more,"I agree very much with the sentiments expressed by others. The limited information conveyed in the course is superb. However, it is just too limited to be useful. I hope that Pimsleur produces a more comprehensive set of Swedish tapes in the near future."
3,Only an introduction to Swedish.,"This course is great at teaching you to speak and understand totally from memory about a dozen or so phrases in Swedish without the use of a textbook. But the lack of phrases is its major limitation. You will need other Swedish courses to build up a useful vocabulary. However, it is truely a course that can be used while driving to work. I hope that Pimsleur will produce the longer course for Swedish."
3,"Good, but basic","This program is very good at repeating and coaching on the limited vocabulary. Do not expect to know much Swedish at the end of the program. You will, however, know the words that are presented."
4,Rudy Fans try this one,"This CD is fun or funny, what have you. In addition to having the two songs recorded by Rudy ""El Relicario"" and ""Kashmiri Song"" albeit augmented by the orchestra on the CD (it doesn't hurt them) there are songs like ""The Sheik of Araby"" inspired by the movie ""The Sheik"" starring Rudy in 1921. In addition are songs inspired by other movies along with just some fun ones of the 1920's, mostly ""Araby"" inspired. A couple fun ones are ""The Rudolph Valentino Blues"" and ""If I had a man like Valentino"". The original songs on the CD are okay; nothing to rave about. If you are a Rudy fan, try this one. It's worth a listen."
1,"Great Film, Terrible DVD","Don't buy this DVD! Very poor copy (fuzzy, weak color) of film (transfered from a VHS tape?). The subtitles (NOT removable) hard to read. No chapter stops. No extras except some equally fuzzy previews for other Cinevista products. Very disappointing cheap issue at a high price. Hopefully some other company will issue a proper version some day."
3,The outline of a ground breaking film,"I had read so much about this film before purchasing, and was so excited to finally be able to view it, I actually had a good mix of sexually divergent friends over for the ""opening"". The varied opinions afterward were remarkably similar - not enough sex to be porno, not enough empathy for the leads to be an effective drama. I don't know if this would have been better as a short film (my leaning) or as a couple of separate films, but with this your choices are : a longing for domestication guy who is trying to make it work with a nymphomaniac, um, other guy. Who happens to be the lead,writer, and director. The sex is brief, hot, and explicit. In every aspect it could have been more so. And if the writing could have transcended the bottom/doormat vs. top/anything with anyone goes lead, it could have been remarkable. 3 stars because the sex, is in fact, hot."
3,FRED JACOBS JAZZ TRUMPET DEBUT,"Get the feeling of shifting gears that alludes to time zone changes while on the road or jetting from one place to another, as you will see in the graphic design on the CD back cover. Hear Ahmed and recognize Jamal. Feel Fred's spiritual influence of Coltrane in Grace. Feel the lyrical sense in his Contempo. Discover Fred's romantic side in Ruby My Dear.-Dan Kassell"
5,The Best!,"This product has kept my immune system up all winter long. Between traveling, working and always being on the go, Wellness Formula is my first line of defense to stay healthy and active!"
5,Source Wellness,"This is a wonderful combination of vitamins and herbs that really helps when I feel a cold coming on. The beauty of amazon is that I was able to buy it in Michigan and send it to my daughter in Florida when she was feeling sick. Which is funny because when she lived at home, she would fight me to take them (but she took them). Then she went off to school and the first thing she asked for when she was feeling sick was the wellness formula. They are a little hard to get past the nose (I just plug my nose), but they work wonders. One might say ""miraculous"". They also have a liquid elixir that is good in orange juice, well let's not say ""good"" but palatable. I would not be well without them."
5,Awesome Cold Zapper,I love this product and have been using it for years. And this is a great price. We use this as a family and it really zaps your colds. In fact I start taking it if anyone is sick in our family and I usually don't get sick or have very mild symptoms. My daughter is a CNA certified nursing assistant and she uses this and hardly ever gets sick. I am now taking this daily as a vitamin. I don't care for the capsules because you have to take so many of them. This tablet does taste strong and is large so if you have problems swallowing this might not be for you.
4,Good preventative,"I take the Wellness Forumula daily in fall, winter, and spring. I have a young child in daycare and work in an office environment, and so I am constantly exposed to cold viruses. The Wellness Formula seems to help build my immunity defense, so I can fight off colds which I used to get a least once a month.I recommend the Wellness Formula for reducing the frequency of colds and building a stronger immunity defense."
5,works miracles,I start taking this whenever I feel a cold or flu coming and I have not gotten sick in over 2 years! It is awesome.
5,Been relying on Wellness for about 25 years now!,"A friend recommended Wellness to me some 25 years ago. I have depended on it to keep me flu free, cold free, healthy in general, and it's a total success. I have gone through flu epidemics at work and I'm the one that doesn't catch it. I recommend Wellness every chance I get. It works for me."
5,Great Product! Worth every penny,This product works especially well when you have that slight tingle in your throat and it's probably going to turn into a full blown cold/flu...the bottle says to take 6 pills=one serving size. I really really do feel like it gets you out of the woods. It doesn't seem to work if you are already full blown sick. Every one of my family members uses this product..It's worth every penny...about $20 to be exact..they carry it at my local Sprouts.
2,Works well but smells horrible,These pills are massive and they smell so bad that I could not continue taking them. They taste horrible and the taste lingers for a while... its totall gross... i would reccomend Source Naturals Herbal Resistance Liquid (Alcohol Free Formula) as an alternative. It works amazingly and basically you'll never be sick again! and it tastes much much better and is much easier to take!!!
1,didn't care to tell me it wasn't in stock,the one thing I hate is ordering something and waiting for 2 weeks and have to back track and check to see why it's not here. This company doesn't have the common deccentcy to send an email that it ISN'T IN STOCK...POOR SERVICE.. WON'T BE BACK.
5,Source Naturals Olive Leaf,Excellent product with high quality service! Highly recommend! The product was in great shape when I got it. Very good job sending it!
4,They're OK - Source Naturals Wellness Formula,"I can't really say how they're working because I take medicine for allergies, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, and an hiatal hernia, and I take other health supplements, but Source Naturals Wellness Formula was recommended by my doctor so I ordered it and started taking it about two months ago.To the glory of God, my blood pressure is great, and I have been feeling better lately along with exercising!"
2,Wellness Formula,Had a virus. Tried everything to help get over it. . . . Dont know if this helped or not. I was down at least 14 days. . . . ugh!
1,deceptive seller,I ordered 240 tablets and received 240 capsules. you have to take twice as many capsules as tablets which means my product cost twice as much as expected. very misleading image and labels in the order form.
5,Wellness Wonder!,"Our family has been using Wellness Formula for over 15 years. We take it occasionally, once a day, as a health supplement. We take a double dose several several times a day during periods when symptoms of illness occur. I am 57 years old. In my younger years, I was ill several times a year. Since using Wellness Formula I'm hardly ever ill.I highly recommend this product."
3,CAPSULES NOT TABLETS,I HAVE USED THE PRODUCT IN TABLET FORM FOR MANY YEARS. I ORDERED THIS NOT REALIZING IT WAS CAPSULES. IT SAYS IT HAS THE SAME INGREDIENTS BUT IT DOES NOT WORK AS WELL FOR ME. I NOW TAKE 3 A DAY WHEN BEFORE I TOOK ONLY ONE.
5,Best Vitamin,"I have been using Wellness Formula for well over a decade. It truly is the best vitamin I have found to either prevent me from getting sick when everyone around me has a cold, flu, etc, or to help me quickly recover when I've already gotten sick.I was recently in Italy and began to feel run down and I started taking these daily and I was fine the entire trip. It's a must have in my home."
1,Take care of it before you get sick,The Wellness Formula pills really help you from getting a cold if you start them as soon as you feel a cold coming on.
2,"Strong taste and smell, questionable effects","Ok, so, the taste and smell is very strong. When you are felling sick at first, this smell really want to make you gag. My girlfriend got a bad stomach flu that resulted in it coming out both ends. I knew it was only a matter of time for me. I went ahead and started this product... no suck luck. I started having the double ended action too. I actually kept that up until I dehydrated my way into the hospital. Maybe that bug was just too much for it. She took nothing and got off better than I did."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,"I have been taking these for almost a year- they are amazing. At the first sign of getting sick, follow the directions, I would take more than 1 etc. I would swallow them with a bite of food to get around the taste. They worked 100% of the time.I bought them at GNC. My GNC is out of them. I went on-line, ordered them, and much to my delight saved 50%. Yea. I took 1 today and got so dizzy and sick and nausious. Ugh. Why would I order something on-line and swallow it???? I do not recommend buying this on-line."
5,THE BEST immune system booster,"Ok, I used to get a respiratory infection once a month for pretty much most of my life. That is over 20 years. I have tried all sorts of different products to help me fight against getting sick, nothing, I repeat, nothing has worked for me except for this product. I am truly a believer. I recommend that you take 3 tablets daily to maintain health and the minute you feel like you may be getting run down, begin taking 3 tablets every three hours. Also, if you know that you are about to go through a hectic period or the flu season is coming on, begin to increase dosage. Those who a CFIDS or Fibromyalgia sufferers may find a great benefit from using this product as well. I am not easily impressed, but this sure has impressed me. Cheers to health!"
5,Miracle in a Bottle!,"I bought these pills and would take them every now and then when I felt that something was coming on (a cold, a sore throat) and I always felt better soon after. I knew I had found a lifesaver when my husband and I went home for Christmas. EVERYONE was sick with something different and we were both very worried about catching something. We both just kept popping these not-so-little tablets and neither one of us caught anything. It truly was a Christmas miracle. :)"
3,ehhh....,"i bought these because of the enormous endorsement by my super health conscious (vegan) friend. when i got them i couldnt believe the funk! i have taken them and did not notice if they helped or not. i take them occasionally when not feeling well (but only at night). they give you the WORST breath and you can taste them for a while after swallowing. the after taste actually prevents me from taking them on a daily basis. too bad, because i would like to see what all the hype is about. smell is AWFUL."
5,Really Helps!,"My husband and I take this at the first sign of imbalance. We have been using this product for years. It is made up of great stuff, like garlic and vit-c as well as an array of other natural defense-building ingredience. They say an apple a day, keeps the doc away (make sure that's an organic apple these days!) And I would include this stuff in your immune-building repertoire."
2,Three strikes and I am out,"This is my third order of this item. The second time I ordered it, it worked well for a while then one of the plastic ribs in the bra began to stick out under my fitted garmets. It looked like a knot or a bubble under my fitted clothes. Thinking that maybe I had done something wrong, I ordered another one and the same thing happened after the second wearing. Now I am out of a lot of money with two bras that have failed me. Shame on me. Other than that I could have loved the bra. Did not bother to send them back because the attachment said that if I took the tag off I had to keep it. I bought the first one for my daughter to wear in her wedding and that one worked well for her. I thought about writing you all a couple of times to share my experience but did not think that it would make much difference. Thanks for the opportunity.Dr. Davis"
4,Here they come..,"and they are coming full force into the local music world. This Cd was good, others' are destined to be great. The Burners have top talent in musicians, writes, and producers. These guys work hard, play hard, and truly strive to be the best they can be for their fans. I have never encountered a band that is as receptive, and down to earth as the Burners. They reach every age group of their fans... everyone is on the dance floor at some time or another. We are only going to see bigger, better top of the line music from BUK.."
4,Pastic aircraft kit,"The plastic parts were very authentic and intricate. The decals were good and not so old that they disintegrated when attempting to apply. A steady hand is required when assembling it, as an accidental drop of glue will ruin a finely detailed part. But I think a colored detailed picture of the plane as the paint scheme from each unit it was employed from should be included."
2,CHEAP!,Do you want cheap or good? These are the cheapest pads anywhere. If your dog is bigger than a hamster they are not going to be absorbent enough. They are probably fine for small puppies.
1,Poor and Thin and not absortant!,This pad I ordered is very poor thin quality same as what I ordered from a different seller for less then half the price! What a rip off and the delivery shipment was very late! Yes the seller Overpriced it! I contacted the seller for return shipping and the seller wants the customer to pay for the return shipping. And the Product is not opened and still in original shipping package. Shipping cost estimate was too much! So I just keep and use it. Warning do not waste your money on this poor thin quality pad. I just want to share this to everyone before they decides to order this. Hope this save people from wasting their money.
1,not very flexable,We had bought the mold to make mints and it did not work. It was almost impossible to get the mint out of the mold. And when we did get them out they looked like carrots. I wouldn't buy them again.
5,The best traditional hawaiian music you can find!,"Hui Ohana, comprised of Ledward and Nedward Kaapana and Dennis Pavao sing in beautiful falsetto and tenor, play slack key, and bring the warm breezes of the islands into your home. You won't find any better, authentic old style (or new) Hawaiian music."
5,Great Book for Your Collection,"Book is great and is a very good addition to my library. Very disappointed that the advertisement said the book was autographed, and when it was received, there was no autograph. Amazon needs to check their stock against their advertisements."
5,Excellent Book,Very detailed and extensive patterns for the true fly tyer. This book is a must have for tying files and filling your fly boxes with great flies.
4,Does what it says,"Although I don't think it lasts as long as they say it does, these strings are great. My only complaint is that they left a residue on my fingers when I first put them on."
4,5 banjo strings,Nothing' perks up the ears of some city folk like the sweet rang of a five string resonating out of the holler. To know the sweet love of a banjo is not unlike the love for your first born. There is an underground group of pickers that President Obama turns to in moments that require true grit. They in fact gave the green light on Mr. bin laden. The bottom line: play the banjo and buy elixer strings.
2,Don't Buy It.,Cassidy is sick but he used a bunch of his mixtape releases on the CD and the CD is not up to anybody's expectations. Don't get it unless you're too rich.
4,Unknown,The album is fire. Ya need to go kop that album. Not the best ablum in the world but its fire. Cassidy is a good young rapper so go kop is album people.His lyrics or fire and swizz beatz has the crazy beats. So go buy the album its worth your money. 1
1,Not worth the cash!,"Cassidy cannot do 1 decent song on his own, the man is talentless, (RECALL: Hotel was done with R.Kelly, Don't get no better only sounded hot thanks 2 Mashonda, + Don't care who knows which featured Keisha White). All the promotion Cassidy is being given (VERY UNFAIRLY) should be given 2 Mashonda + Keisha White. Remember Athena Cage who was a guest artist on Keith Sweat's singles Nobody, Get up on it, + Twisted. Athena Cage was eventually given a solo deal with Priority records but was given ZERO promotion. Let's hope the same thing does not happen 2 Mashonda (she has an awesome voice!). Just cos R.Kelly featured on Cassidy's record does not mean he is cool."
1,Trash,"Cassidy blows. ""I became the best when BIG died"" yeah right you moron. You're a crappy rapper and your joints are wack."
2,Battle rapper...more like Pop rapper,"Upon listening to this cd I had heard alot of hype about Cassidy being a great battle/street rapper and was excited to hear his album. Before the album came out I saw his first video on MTV and I almost lost it, after all the hype, this Cassidy kid was doing a bubble-gum pop rap song with R Kelly. I could not believe that after all the hype, Cassidy was just another radio friendly Chingy/Nelly/Ja Rule or Faboulous. After listening to the album, the first 5 songs are straight pop. Although the rest of the album gets more street, it is kind of hard to believe after Cassidy was just doing the bubble gum songs. Hip Hop really needs a saviour in 2004...."
2,Split Personality by Cassidy,"Cassidy is one of the rappers at the forefront of the new hip hop movement known simply as the post-Jigga era. Like his peers J-Kwon, Chingy & Murphy Lee, he uses the same formula; one hot single, mediocre album. The only song here that is an instant smash is the R. Kelly collabo ""Hotel"" which has already seen its peak on the charts. An appearence by Snoop Dogg on ""Make You Scream"" couldn't save it from being one of the album's weaker moments, and even though ""Can I Talk to You"" & ""Pop that Cannon"" are awful, appearences by Jadakiss & Styles P are awesome. The album has nothing original what-so-ever (typical of any rap album in recent memory) and lyrically Cassidy just doesn't deliver, which is a shame because his mixtape freestyles were always very entertaining."
1,Sick of worthless newcomers,"Ok, my advice is dont buy this. All the new hip-hop an the radio is worthless crap (ie J-Kwon/Eamon). Ill admit RKellys hook on ""Hotel"" is catchy, but the rest of this album is weak. I am looking forward to the end of this year when the veteran rappers who know what they are doing (50, Em, Dre) drop thier new albums."
2,Could have been better.,I bought this album hoping that it would be mostly new songs. Instead it is 80% of songs already released on the mixtapes in the streets (for those who knows about that). I am mad at this cd not because of cassidy but because it was just thrown together and not carefully planned out.
3,What happend Cassidy,"This album was ok, not exceptional like it should have been. Cassidy used to be the 5 foot monster when he was freestyling. Now he has only got enough star power to be second banana to swiss beats."
4,potential,skillz are ok but check out the new afromman disc. its oldschool chill with tight beats and lyrics. join the streetteam on his website.
5,very good,Ive read some of the reveiws and i saw some bad ones. I just have to give my props to cassidy because i wasnt even i fan of his until I heard a freind of mine playing te cd. Im a beat person and this cd is fill with some of the best beat ever except for a few (2)songs. His lyric are nice to. If you buy this you wont be dissappointed.
2,i didn't feel it!,no this cd isnt all that! i bootlegged it to get a little taster and i was very dissapointed! cassidy can do well better and tha beats are wack! there are two gud songs on this album get no better with mashonda which is heavy! and pop that cannon they r tha only two good songs on there. Don't bother buyin it its a waste of money! i don't think cassidy will do well in the future but he is fine!
2,stay true to who u are,"this album aint the cassidy i kno from the mixtapes filled with punchlines. this is a mainstream radio friendly casidy makin songs for the club, radio and ladies. bring that gritty rap music laced with the punchlines that made u famous"
2,ok,I lik cassidy but i hav all his freestyles on my comp. this album wasnt cassidy. it was not the battle rapper wit crazy punchlines. well his new album Im A Hustla comin out soon.. hopefully we get the real cassidy
1,I'm gonna be sick!!!!!!,"I wish i could line all wack artist like cassidy (Joe Budden, Lil john etc) up and just take the flame thrower to the clowns. Please don't support garbage. Support Mos Def!"
3,So much talent but didn't use it!!!,As a big fan since his battle days i would have to say i never heard him come this weak! The songs on the album are ok but compared to all of the good songs he put on mixtapes i'll have to say Split Personality is isn't what i thought it was going to be. But im not going to worry because i know he's going to realize the mistake he made with this album and take the game over on his next one.
1,Really deserves no stars,"After much hype from his ""DJ On Point: Best of Cassidy"" mixtape I was thinking that this album would be hot. But he dissapointed me pretty much from the beginning to the end. For him to be a real nice battle and punchline rapper, this is a terrible album. The only good tracks were: ""Can I Talk To Ya ft. Jadakiss""; ""Interpretation of the Industry""; and ""Pop That Cannon"". But majority of the beats were wack. There should have been more production from other nice producers. A lot of Swizz Beats (beats) sound the same to me. So...if you were thinkin about coppin this album...DONT...or either get it bootleg...and make sure you dont pay for that!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worthless!!!!!,"Could You Believe That This Guy Ate Up ""FREEWAY""? He's Suppose 2 Be A Hard Rapper... His Album Is So Lovey Dovey, Soft & Worthless"
3,"Da Problem Is Da Problem, But he Still Hot",Yo my boy cass did ight wit da album but it coulda ben betta. Cassidy is da truth and cant nobody right now in da battling industry see him not even banks or J-hood. Yea i agree wit da pop songs but da boy is doin it fa erbody ya feel me. Dats why da album is called split personality. Hopefully his next album wont be nuthin like dis. But my man swizz be holdin it down. but overall dis album ight.
5,Cassidy Da Problem but not a problem fo me!!,"its a great cd. i luved every song espcially ""Get no Betta"" i love that song. da beat is off da hook. if i would rate the cd it would be a 5 stars and himself a 100 % fine!!!!"
2,Swizz Beats Murdered it... literally,"Other then very few shining moments Swizz beats must be hands down the most over-hyped and possibly WORST producer in the world. The first time I heard cassidy was on the RR3 album and Cass ripped his part, and since then I waited for his CD to drop, other then the fact that he spends too much time rappin about girls on this album, Shi--Swizz beats' beats ARE GARBAGE. I bought the album only cauz hopefully it'll help Cass put out an album with a producer that doesn't suck. Anyway if you wanna spend you money put down on Joe Budden, hes got a new album commin out and if not his old one is still hot."
3,Decent,"Cassidy's new album ""Split Personality"" is OK. Nothing exceptional to it, it's just OK. I know he could do much better with this, it seems like he softened up too much. He's nice with his freestyling, but he pussies out on this CD. Most of his songs talk about women, love, and mushy crap like that, we don't wanna hear that stuff from a battle cat like Cassidy. We wanna hear deep lyrics, and clever ones for that matter.The only track that seems like he put an amount of work into is the intro, ""My Interpretation"", which I think is the best track on the album. But this being Cassidy's first album, I'll give him his props, but I hope he does better in the future."
1,battle rapper not a album rapper,"I was very disappointed with Cassidy's cd. I thought he woulod be doing his thing on this cd, but that was not the case. I agree with Music Fan a lot of the songs are off of mixtapes. I think he should've went with some other producers besides Swizz Beatz. The only song I like is the Hotel remix. Don't waste your money on this cd."
3,Cd is Hott but Used on Mixtapes,cassidy is a tite punchline battle rapper from philly who dserves credit for Split personality but not as much as i thought tho like 5 tracks already been used on banks vs cassidy and other mixtapes realeased for yall who kno bout that and he kept it a lil 2 pop from what i heard on them. overall tho mad props 2 the kid n swizz 4 puttin a prolly platinum album 2getha
4,this cd may not be what we expected...,"but cassidy gets love from my area regardless, im from north philly, and even if his album isnt what we thought it would be, its still another artist to represent our area. he gets alot of airplay on the radio with ""the problem"" i hear it all the time, but like i said philly has love for cassidy regardless. PHILLY STAND UP."
1,Worst album I have ever heard!!!!,"I can't believe Cassidy could have dropped such a huge turd on us and expect us to like this. When I heard hotel I thought it was a tight song. I couldn't wait to get it thinking the rest has to be great, but I was wrong. Hotel and get no betta are the only good songs on this piece of crap. Not worth your money."
4,English From the Roots Up Vol. II,This is a great resource to expose students to word origins and increase their vocabulary.
3,A combo release ??,"This compilation appears to be a combination of the first album, (self titled 1980) and 1982's Picture This. Do the sums!"
4,title...,"this item is made of the design in plastic on front (the back is solid white w/bumps)and it keeps your ipod protected well, but makes it harder to use dial, but not impossible, and does make your ipod quite a bit bulkier...overall a pretty nice product."
3,Boys like it.. .could be better,"I got this toy as a gift for my two infant sons. They were really afraid of it at first. The music is really really loud, and every time I turned it on, they would scream. There aren't a lot of toys on this gym compared to other gyms, and the mirror is pretty much worthless. I added extra toys that hang down lower, which seems to be a lot better. It comes with a really neat little ""mini boppy"" pillow that is great for a lot of things! Also, the colors are bright and keep them both entertained. Another big plus is that it folds down really easily compared to other gyms and it stores nicely. Plus, it is very washable and can withstand lots of washes because of a baby who spits up a lot."
5,I love this gym,"I received this gym as a shower gift and I am so thankful that we have it. We began putting my daughter under it when she was only a few weeks old and she enjoyed looking at all the dangling objects and the lights. Now she's 4 1/2 months old and this is by far her favorite toy. The only thing that I would change about it is to have a way to turn off the sound (but still have the lights work)--it's pretty loud and gets a little annoying. Most of the time I don't turn it on and she enjoys it anyways. Regardless, I still give this an easy 5 stars. It's a little pricey but worth every penny."
1,not the safest,"This product, like many others, seems a must-have for babies. My son was laying on it today on his back playing with all of the dangling toys. He pulled his feet into the air, and hooked his leg around one of the poles above his head. Within one second, as he brought his leg back down to the floor with the pole tangled up in it, he became rolled up and encassed inside the mat. The pillow ended up on his face while he was trapped in the mat. I will definitely be writing to the company to complain. Thank goodness he was not unsupervised."
5,baby einstein play gym,my baby is 3 months old and he absolutely LOVES this. He is sooo content for a couple of hours! Of all the toys we have tried with him this is by far his favorite! I would definitely recommend this!
4,Great Fun!,My daughter is almost 5 months and has been playing in this gym for a few months now. She loves it! The mirror mesmerizes her and she loves pulling at the toys.My only complaint - the music has to be restarted too often!
5,SON LOVES IT!!!,"I searched the internet for a nice little play gym for my 4 month old son. I saw this one and couldn't believe the price! I went to Target and realized that this was worth the price. I bought it, brought it home, set it up in less than 5 minutes and let my son have fun!! He loves it, it keeps him entertained for as long as I need! His older sister who is 2 also has a great time with it as well. The music (all classical) is not loud and annoying and all the little attachments are so amusing to him. I would recommend this little play gym for any baby...it is worth the price."
5,My daughter's favorite place!,My two month old daughter loves this gym! She will watch the musical star for 20 minutes at a stretch- amazing! This is one of the best purchases we have made.
2,BORING!!,"Like the previous reviewer, we received both the Baby Einstein and Gymini activity mats. We actually tried them out ourselves by lying down on the mat and looking up to get the baby's point of view (try it yourself!). We didn't find the Baby Einstein to be stimulating, creative, or riveting. We kept the Gymini and I'm so glad we did. Our baby loved it and kept discovering new things about it every few days."
3,Einstein Play Gym review,"For the price it could be a bit more detailed. The green card holder only comes with one card (A cardboard Bunny photo) it'd be better if it were a ""teething Type"" card with back to back photo's of animals. The star that plays music lists it as ""motion"" however the only way for it to be motioned is to hit the side of the ""gym."" And it only goes through one song regardless of whether it's on motion or On..and then you have to push on one of the stars to play the song. It'd be much more worth it if it played more songs, again strictly due to the price of this item. overall it's not bad, but Had I known these things prior to purchasing it, I'd have either waited for a coupon for this item, or bought something better. In addition the size of the gym seems small. One plus side is the little green kidney bean pillow is great for propping up baby for belly time..not unattended of course."
5,best baby gift,"Baby Einstein rocks! This activity mat was the best baby gift I received. From a few weeks old through about 6 months old, this was my baby's favorite toy. In the beginning she's stare lovingly at the ladybug. Then she discovered the star and she fell in love! Once she discovered how to kick the mat to make the star play music, she was in heaven. As soon as the music stopped, she would kick the mat again. She would do this over and over again. For months, the only way I could escape to take a shower was to put her on this mat. When she got older, she loved playing with all of the hanging toys. I got this as a gift, but if I had bought it, it would have been well worth the money! I highly recommend this product."
5,Great Toy! Excellent Customer Service!,"I bought this toy used off ebay and my then 2-month old son immediately fell in love with it, especially the musical blinking star. And of course, (just because I bought it used) after about 3 weeks, the speaker in the star starting to go out, it only played half of the first song before going all scratchy and then it would stop playing altogether. I contacted the company via email, asking them if I could only replace the musical star. I was expecting to be ignored, given the run around, or at least be charged for the part, especially since I was honest and told the representative that I bought it off ebay. However, I received a prompt reply asking for my shipping info and a code off the tag on the play gym and 8 days after first contact with the company I received my new musical star. I was very impressed that they were willing to stand behind their product, even a second-hand purchase. My little guy is going to be thrilled when he wakes up from his nap! :)"
4,A Terrific Playmat,"Being a 1st time mom, I had no idea that my son would ""need"" one of these until I received it as a gift. He actually didn't like it much at 4-6 weeks, but by 7 weeks he loved it. Now at 9 weeks he squeels with delight and kicks & swats at the toys for about 15 minutes 2-3 times a day. I love to set it to motion to let him control the activity star, which is definately the main attraction on this toy.The only drawback for me is that the volume level is not adjustable & the lights do not work unless the music is playing too."
5,Baby's first toy,This is the first toy my baby played with. She started to like it at 6 months. The star mesmerized her and then she starting hitting and kicking toys by accident. Soon she was hitting and kicking them on purpose to activate the star. She laughs and smiles when she plays with it. It's lots of fun! I highly recommend it. I can see her growing into this too. We can raise or lower the toys depending on how active she is.
4,The Star is worth the $50.,"The Star that attaches to the gym is worth all of the $50 itself. My daughter loved the star so much and used it all the time. She also likes the squeaky duck, which we now took off and is one of her toys. The only thing I wish it had was extra tummy time stuff on the mat itself for her to get interested in."
5,My Daughter LOVES it!,"My daughter is 3 months and can't get enough of this play mat! She laughs and coos at the lights and music and now she is starting to kick at the toys to get the music started. It is easy to wash, too, since she tends to sometimes spit up on it. <br /><br />"
5,Best toy we've got!,"My baby has loved this gym since she was about 2 weeks old! At first, she just liked to look at the red toys - the bird and the ladybug. As she got older, she was more interested in the rest of the toys, and started batting at them. She became very interested in the star with the music and lights at around 6 weeks old, and she's recently become fascinated by the mirror. And I think she's just figuring out that she can get the music and lights started by batting at the toys or kicking the bars. It keeps her entertained for a pretty long time, so my husband and I can eat dinner together again!"
3,"Ok, mat could be better","I received this as a gift but I would like to have seen what other mats out there have something more substantial for baby's tummy time. Some crinkly bits or different textures would have been nice since my daughter was very into touch. The overhead hanging things are ok, the musical star is the best feature but the movement sensor isn't that sensitive - I usually have to get up and turn it off & on again to get it to go. My baby liked me gently shaking the frame to make the toys move. I think there are better things out there for the money."
3,Expected much more from Baby Enstein,This gym does not have much going for it other than the motion light star that hangs from the top and plays music with lights. The toys are quite small and don't make much noise. The mat has faded tremendously after 3 washings. Mirror is so tiny my twins have still not noticed it. The picture of the rabbit is also useless. We've had to add our own toys to make this entertaining. The mat does not have any textures or noise features to encourage movement. Tiny Love Deluxe is a much better buy. You will be disapointed with this gym if you know better.
3,Not as good as expected,"A playmat is a must have baby item. This is one of the few things my son actually likes to play with. It is easy to travel with and easy to wash(machine washable for mat and toys).We received this one and the Gymini by Tiny Love. I have to admit of the two...my son likes the Gymini better. The size of the Baby Einstein mat is considerably smaller than that of the Gymini. I would have preferred another toy rather than a picture of a rabbit. I felt this was a waste and a disappointment in the few selected items this gym offers. The best feature is the two birds that squeak. My son loves them. The Gymini has flowers that squeak on the mat as well as music, a generous size mirror and colorful and appealing toys. Overall I would recommend the Gymini over the Baby Einstein."
5,Most Amazing Gym!,"I purchased this for my 3 month old son a few weeks ago. and I cannot rave about it enough!!!!! It has so many bells that even a parents sees as amazing, but wait till your baby gets down there! I am attachment parenting, and have found it difficult to get him to do ANYTHIMG without me! he sleeps with me, I'm breastfeeding him, and he is such a mommy's boy! he will NOT go in a bouncy, in a swing, in his crib, in his carseat (of course he has no choice of this) or ANY other contraption. the only thing he wants is MOMMY'S ARMS! that was untill this activity mat! I almost didn't buy it because I was afraid it would go to waist like all the other stuff, but from the first moment he was in love! he loves the toys, he loves the lights and music, he loves the tummy pillow HE LOVES THIS MAT! I can now actually get a shower, or make lunch (ON THE STOVE) since we got this mat, How did I live without it????? I'm sure your bundle will love it too! It's definatly for the picky baby!"
4,Great for newborn-5mnths,"This item is really neat. It has alot of things for the baby to look at and some of the toys are interactive (sqeaking, playing music). When my son was about a week old, I would lie him on the mat (while I did the dreaded dishes) so he could look at the hanging toys. As the months went by he began to bat at them, and then tugged at them in an effort to get them down and play with them. He came to love the mat! Because it has all kinds of loops that can be used to attach more toys (any kind of toy that can hang) we would be able to swap them off the playthings, so he would stay interested longer. Sometimes he would spend up to an hour playing (this enabled him to find amusement on his own, bonus!). But alas when he began to sit up, he was too tall to sit under the arches without getting tangled up in them. So onto new amusements..."
5,Baby LOVES this! Part of his daily routine since day one!,"A must have!! My baby has loved this since day one. He especially loves the musical star that lights up. He is so fascinated with all the things hanging down that I really do think this is a great learning toy!I put him in his gym every morning for a little while, and he absolutely loves it.This and the aquarium swing are ABSOLUTE necessities for new parents!"
5,My Special Needs Baby Loves It!,"My son, who was born with some muscular problems, LOVES this gym! It has been a major motivator in getting him to stretch out, reach for and grasp objects, learn about cause and effect and master other gross and fine motor skills. For the first two months he was fascinaed with the ladybug, now we take the rattle off and let him practice kicking by putting the links with the rattle around his legs (he's starting to be more partial towards the duck, too!). We're constantly finding new uses for it. The whole family is mesmerized by the music. As a mom and an educator of young children, I can't say enough about this gym, I would recommend it to ANYONE who has and infant!"
4,A new mom's necessity,"My son loved this play mat and has been using it since he was born. He loves the music and the animals. Now that he's a little older (5 months) he enjoys spending tummy time on it and loves the pictures on the mat itself. I also like the fact that you can take the whole top off and just use it for a safe place for the baby to crawl around on and play. This mat has taken him through 5 months now and I can see him using it for many more. Another great product from Baby Einstein.My only complaint is that the motor from the star that lights up and plays music died. I have not tried to call the company or try and return it, but we'll see what happens."
2,A little disappointed,"We purchased this toy when my daughter was about 1 month old. We figured for the price it must have been a good toy, but after 5 mins of the music my husband and I were ready to take it back. It plays only 2 or 3 diff. tunes. My daughter however did like the toys and the star, but she would only lay under it for about 10 mins. She is now 5 months old and still does not like this toy. We do hook the animals onto another musical toy(made by Playskool) that was given to us by a friend whose daughter had outgrown it and she likes it much better and I believe it only costs about $20. This isn't a terrible toy, I just expected a lot more out of it for the price."
1,My daughter hated it,"I don't know if it was because my daughter was already 3 months old when I bought this (maybe you should introduce it to a much younger infant?) or that she wouldn't have liked it anyway. She cried when the star was turned on and she didn't seem interested in any of the hanging toys. When she was placed on her back, she kept trying to roll over (to get away from that star, or so it seemed) and she learned to roll over right away. Unfortunately, the pad is so rough that her cheeks were bright red from rubbing against it for only 5-10 min. Maybe washing it would fix that problem, but I returned it the next day. Also, it was smaller than I expected."
1,Is the Size Stated right?,"I just ordered this item and then realized how small it is. 16""? That's smaller than most newborns! Even placed diagonally, the baby can't be more than 22"" long. Is it really that small, you who have ordered and love this toy? I would appreciate knowing that in preparation for trying to return it.UPDATE: I did figure out that only the baby's head and shoulders need to be on the mat. The size does work. I would change the stars to perhaps to ****"
1,Not worth the money!,"My son liked this gym for only a few weeks. He quickly became bored with the toys and the musical lights made him cry everytime they were turned on. Luckily we received this as a gift and we didn't pay the hefty $50 pricetag. We now have the Gymini by Tiny Love and my son (4 months) LOVES playing with it every morning. The music is much better, the hanging animals are more captivating, and the large mirror is perfect for curious infants. Save yourself some money and buy the Tiny Love Gymini."
4,Babies will be easily entertained,"We received this from our registry and have been using it with our son from the start. He is now at the age (5 1/2 months) where he truly enjoys it. He loves the squeaky birds and bats at the rattles. The music is a little loud and I'm not so sure he likes that as much, but overall this is a great toy."
4,just okay,"We recieved two different activity gyms for my daughter, and she likes the other one better. I will say the little animals that attatch to this are really cute. We took the red bird off, so my daughter can take it with her since she likes it so well, but she spends more time under the other one, it's the jungle one."
5,Favorite Toy!,"My son just LOVES this play gym! He has been enjoying it since he was just a few weeks old and he's now 4 months. He plays with it every single day and none of the other toys he has generate as much excitement and activity. I don't know how this gym would compair to less expensive ones in regards to his response, since this is the only one we've used. However, I would definitely recommend this be on all of your registry lists!"
2,Broken too soon,"Our son loved it for the first month, but then the star (which lights up and plays music- his favorite part) broke. I read some other reviews and this seems to be a common problem, [..]"
3,"Decent, but there are better ones","When in the market for a Baby Gym, this one will do the trick, but I highly recommend the Tiny Love baby gym over this one. There are 2 things about this one that stand out. As one person mentioned, it does have a neat star that eats batteries :) Also, the little caterpillar that detaches is very cute.I do not like the way this baby gym handles when putting it up or setting it up."
5,Must have- worth the high price tag,I was a little unsure about putting such an expensive gym on my registry but I am so glad I did! My daughter is 10 weeks old and she loves it! At about 6 weeks she fell in love with the light up musical star (we call it STARRY!) and now (at 10 weeks) she loves chatting with the red bird and duck that dangle from the bars. This gym can keep her entertained for up to 30 minutes at a time! Especially if I position her feet where she can kick a bar easily so the music will play. I look forward to what she will do with it in the upcoming weeks!
5,LOVE IT!!,We had the Ocean Wonders Kick and Crawl and our daughter hated playing with it. It did not stimulate her at all and she cried two minutes after placing her under the gym. We then decided to buy a new Kick and Play and we went with the Baby Einstein Play Gym. My daughter loves it! It stimulates her senses and amuses her and me. There are so many toys to play with and she loves the musical star at the top that plays the music and flashes lights. Everything about the play gym is educational including the pad the baby lays on. The musical star has a mode that plays the music when your child tugs at a toy and moves the gym and my daughter just giggles when she makes the music start on her own. We have had this since she was three months old and she is five months old and still just as happy in it as the day we bought it. The play gym is a little pricey but it has been well worth the money.
4,great but somewhat loud,"I really love this gym...we originally bought the Tiny Love Gymini 3-D because it seemed so popular and was cheaper, but it seemed so dull. The Baby Einstein is well worth the extra money. The only complaint I can think of, and this is just my preference, is that the musical star is a little loud when my baby was sleepy...it's too bad that there isn't a lights-only option for the star. Other than that, we love the attachments and have used them as take-along toys(we still use the book at bathtime, and she is 17 months). I am expecting again and can't wait to use this gym again. Great product overall."
4,Great activity,I love this gym because i bought it for my niece on a whim and she enjoyed it but i found that she started to kick the stereo equipment and other furniture. Baby Einstein should have come up with another way for it to play music. I love it but I still think parents should physically spend time with their child instead of sticking it with a toy.
2,boo,"I am very disappointed with this playmat. I purchased it because I figured since it was a Baby Einstein product, it had to be good. Plus, the reviews for it were excellent. First of all, the playmat is too small for my boy. He is an average six month old (19 pounds, 29 inches). Whenever he rolls onto his tummy on this mat, he ends up halfway off the mat. Second, the musical star only plays three very short songs. My boy gets bored of the repetition. Third, when I purchased the mat, I liked how vibrant the colors were. After a couple washings, the colors have faded and the mat looks like we've had it for a lot longer than we really have.Don't get me wrong. My boy does like to chew on the animals and he will look at himself in the mirror occassionally. But the mat only entertains my boy long enough for me to brush my teeth."
3,not as good as i thought,"I bought this for my 3 months old nephew. The only thing he enjoys is the blinking musical star (of course the battery die after a week of use - low battery life). The mat is small and the material they use is not soft, it's a bit too rough for a baby's skin.Another thing i disklike is ... too many tags. Each item has 5-7 tags, the edges of these tags are sharp ... my nephew scratches himself with the tags on the mat. He was trying to roll over, so he as kicking ... and these tags are not so easy to remove. I tried to cut them out ... but it's a difficult task because i don't want to cut into the material. The bird, duck, ladybug, mirror, picture of a rabbit ... every single piece comes with many tags. Why? It's for a baby, and these tags hurt them, and removing them is a chore. Even once the tags are removed, you can feel them ..."
2,Look elsewhere for a tummy time mat/toy bar,"I put this on my baby registry, received it, but now wish I had done more research. This gym is essentially a blanket with a few toys hanging too far away from a baby's reach.The toys do not hang down far so it's impossible for any baby to reach them unless multiple plastic rings are put together from the other toys. The light/musical star is really irritating -- the musical tones sound awful.Don't be wooed by the 'Baby Einstein' theme. This is too expensive for what you get and I really believe you are paying for the name (the DVDs are good, specifically Bach and Mozart). If you're buying this for tummy time, there's nothing special about it. If you're buying it so your baby can grab at objects, it's worthless. My son loves his $9 Sassy Bugs on Board that are attached to his car seat.I wish I had seen this tummy time item before my son was born: Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym."
2,Very disappointing,"I read about this mat online and was impressed by its reviews. So I registered for it and received it as a shower gift. First, I must say my son LOVES this mat. There is a little star that hangs at the top and plays music and lights up. He loves to watch it and sing along with it. (He is 3 mos. old) Unfortunately, the star has broken TWICE. The first time it just stopped playing after only a few weeks. I called the manufacturer and they sent a replacement. GREAT. So, I was using it and after about 10 hours of play it stopped working. I called the company again and they said the stars are on backorder for 3 mos.!!So...while the mat is great and my son loves the star, the silly thing doesn't work. I would have to say NOT to purchase this mat. There's nothing worse than having your newborn like something and then having it taken away."
3,Look for better,"I read the reviews on this and thought it would be a good one to try. The only thing I really like about it is the motion activated star that lights up. The toys that hang from it are WAY too high for a baby to reach that is lying on his back and are too high for them to see during tummy time. When looking for one, I recommend one that they can kick and grab things. When my baby kicked the side of mat the screw in the star came loose and the star fell. Luckily, she wasn't lying right underneath it or who knows what could have happened. For the price you could find much better."
3,Not impressed,"I thought this gym mat looked really cool with the colors, characters, and music but was pretty disappointed with it overall. My son really enjoys the music and lights on the star however other than that it really does not have many interactive components like I thought it would. My son has been much more interested in other gym mats that my friends own (which are less expensive). Overall I am disappointed b/c of the price and the lack of interest my son has in it."
3,It's Okay....,"I bought this when my daughter was a month old, she is now 18 weeks and only started really playing with the toys about three or four weeks ago. She does however really love the star and I've actually attached it to her carseat instead of leaving it on the gym (she's loved it since I first showed it to her when I bought it). The colors also grab her attention. I agree with another reviewer that they should have included another toy instead of a picture. My daughter doesn't even look at it. The gym is easy to wash and easy to tuck away when not in use. I think that the play mat area of the gym could be larger though. The cost of this gym is a bit high and I wish I had shopped around a little more before making this purchase as I've seen some other playmats since then that may have been a better choice."
4,Great playmat!,"My son just turned 4 months old and now loves this playmat! He didn't really pay attention to the toys on it before, but now, he bats at the toys hanging, stares at himself in the mirrow and rolls all over the floor pad. Plus, I put a picture of our family in the little photo holder, and he looks at the a lot too. The only thing I did not like about it was the music maker. If you turn it on, it plays three little songs, then stops. You have to turn it off, then back on. Now that my son can shake the play mat, I can leave the music maker in ""motion"" mode, so when he shakes it, the music turns on! I would encourage you to buy this product but not before a baby has an interest and can grasp toys and/or can roll!"
4,Overall a good little play gym,"My 4 month old loves her play gym. It's easy and fast to setup or pack away. The mat is easy to wash and a good size for her. The toys are also flexible, so you can take the little stuffed birds with you or clip them on the gym. I just wish the star played a few more tunes."
1,CHOKING HAZARD,"There was a time I would have rated this well, probably 4 stars. However, today we had quite a scare because of this product. A choking hazard size piece (fits inside a toilet paper tube) of plastic broke off of the activity star today, the part of the Baby Einstein activity gym that plays music and shows lights. It is one of the round, yellow pieces of plastic where a light would be shown. My 6.5 month old daughter was playing with her activity gym when I noticed the yellow piece on the floor, picked it up, and determined its origin. I'm so thankful that I found it so quickly before it ended up in her hands/mouth. I'm also very concerned that this happened and the ""what if"" that came too close to happening. I filed a report with the CPSC and the company and I'm waiting to hear back."
2,Definately not worth the money,"I went out an purchased this playmat for my 3 month old son and was very disappointed. ""Baby Einstein"" products seem to be all the rave now but really it wasn't worth the money...the toys and pictures on it are very cheap looking and overall it doesn't come with anything really interesting for them to look at...what's with the picture of the rabbit and the one page book? At the most we use the musical star that it comes with and attach it to the changing table,,,it's the only use we've gotten out of it so far."
4,A good activity center,"I started using this with my twin boys when they were approximately 2 months old. They loved it, especially the musical star with the lights. It was a real lifesaver when I needed a break from holding a baby to be able to put him in the gym for a few minutes. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that the carrying case is ridiculous - it opens from the bottom (handle is on the top with a foldover flap at the bottom that is velcroed in place) so the gym has a tendency to fall out if you use the carrying case a lot and the plastic weakens. Otherwise, a great product."
4,Fantastic,My daughter loves this toy. She has enjoyed it since she was about 4 weeks old. It keeps her occupied for up to 45 min at a time. She gets very excited by the flashing lights and loves to kick the bars on the motion setting. The only bad thing is that the batteries wear out every few days.
5,Without this I would have never survived!,My child received this product as a gift when he was 3 weeks old. He absoulutly loved it from the start. The first day he got it he was able to sit by himself for at least 15 minutes. I was able to get some things done and have a minute to myself. He loved looking at the star and learned very quickly that when he kicked the bars that the music turned back on. The motion dectecter is great. This is the best gift I recieved. My son also liked to kick and pick up the bars with his feet. It was amazing to watch. My son is now 5 months old and is always on the go so the gift is kind of wearing itself out but once in a while he will still lay down and watch the star. It is also nice because the toys can detach. He loves chewing on the birds beak. The only downfall is that the batteries don't last that long. I would reccamend this product because without it I would not have survived those first few months of parenting.
4,One Small Complaint,"My baby loves this gym! It was 100% worth the money. My only complaint is that it doesn't wash particularly well. Maybe I'm the only one whose baby spits up on things, but after washing the floor mat twice, the colors are significantly faded and the filler bunched up a bit. Now I put a burp cloth under her when she uses it so I don't have to wash it as often. But I wouldn't trade it, just wish it was a little more color fast."
4,2nd choice,"My daughter loved this toy, especially the star -- the lights and music were a hit. The star held her attention for good periods of time and made her smile and laugh a lot. The other toys were great for a time also, fun to look at when I made them squeak or rattle for her. The only problem -- as I read in another review -- is that it was only interesting until about 4 or 5 months of age. The links are not strong enough to stand up to a lot of pulling, and the toys are only interesting as far as the baby can hold and chew on them. A friend has the Gymini by Tiny Love and her son is still playing with it at 7 months. The toys on it are more interactive, and the mat is larger to continue to hold babies who are rolling over. While this play gym is GREAT for a few months, another may hold you over longer."
4,Einstein Play Gym,"From the moment my 2.5 months old girl experience her new play pen she just love it. In particular, the light at the top of the unit which plays music with flashing lights, draws her attention a lot. I would recommend this unit to any new parent."
4,Great for playtime,"My baby loves her play gym! It's colorful and she loves the mirror and rattles and all the accessories. The couple of issues I have with it are not major. First, I had to tear 23 tags off all the little do-dads and the mat and such. 23! (They are really stiff tags so I didn't want her to scratch herself with them)The star that lights up and plays songs is great for tummy time... it gives her something to look at. But there is no volume control, and it seems a little loud (she's scared herself awake when she moves it and it starts playing the music).I also feel it's a little pricey for what it is. If I hadn't received it as a shower gift, I'd never have purchased it myself."
2,My problems,My baby loved this play yard. It was the only toy that would keep her attention for more than 10 minutes. The problem is we went through 3 in less than a month. The star and lights device kept shorting out. Sometime is would just keep two seconds of music over and over or sometimes you would hear it shorting out and then just quit. My baby would get upset and just stare waiting for the lights to come back on. I ended up finally just returning and getting something else all together.
1,"IF YOU ARE A NERVOUS FATHER TO BE ""DON'T"" READ THIS!!!!!","My wife and I found out we were pregnant and it was a HUGE surprise to us because we were not planning it. So I went out to buy some books to calm my nerves a bit. This book was a WRONG choice from page one. I think this poor guy who wrote the book had a miserable wife that experienced the worst pregnancy EVER!!! My wife didn't go through half of this stuff, neither did 80% of my friend's wives. If you like being scared out of your socks and prepared for the worst, this is the book for you."
4,very funny,"I bought this as an alternative to the what to expect series, which I found to be a bit clinical for my taste. I liked how funny it was, just what I was looking for."
4,Funny and Informative,I bought this book for my husband and as a gift for a friend. My husband thought it was an enjoyable book. It had useful information. My friend was expecting twins so he was glad to have a book that made him laugh while teaching him a few things. I recomend this book to everyone expecting a child.
4,welcome comic relief during time of uncertainty,"yes, there are many insulting statements in this book, but, they are true!! so don't pay any attention to the thin skinned last reviewer, the book was funny and also had a lot of little practical real life advice & heads ups that you certainly don't get from the dry, banal, and general ""what to expect books."" My husband actually didn't read this, I did, and I got something out of it and some laughs too-- and glad to know I wasn't the only one experiencing some of the taboo details!"
4,I got my husband to read this!,"My husband seems to enjoy this light read, and will compare notes from the book to my pregnancy. He's been more attentive. So while the book won't answer any complicated questions, and seems to only take into account from one pregnancy, it's made my husband to be more attentive to our little bun in the oven."
4,Album is deep and is extremely under-rated espically drummer,The album speaks of deep feelings in line with those of pearl jam. Why has no one else heard of this? And why does amazon.com not have it?
4,What a nice find - try out this very good album!,"You probably won't hear a more personal and touching roots of rock album this year. Also, Joe and the guys of Stone Caravan are among the nicest people you'll ever meet. While they've been compared to everyone from the early work of both Bruce Springsteen to Bob Dylan, Joe stands on his own and with Stone Caravan truly establish a memorable sound for themselves!"
5,simply brilliant rock,This is true rock but also has a good measure of sentiment. It's very reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen and only a matter of time before they are as successful!
2,Mediocre and predictable. Unpleasant.,"A married man in his thirties has an affair with a much younger stewardess. He is not good looking, while she is very attractive. Why would she go for him unless because he is well-off? Why would a man married to a brunette beauty and the father of a lovely daughter endanger everything? There is some suspense as the man tries to avoid getting caught but he does but my sympathy for the loving wife is so great that the suspense is unpleasant.The whole experience is sordid and illogical. Watch the excellent Fatal Attraction instead."
4,Keeps you simultaneously glued to the narrative and fearful of the outcome.,"Both intriguing and frustrating - the latter because you want to reach into the screen and slap the protagonist on the side of the head. The plot seems to go mostly nowhere, yet is thoroughly engrossing. Character development is not thorough, but situational development is both thorough and meticulous. A great psychological exposition. Unfortunately, almost no extras."
1,Stay away unless your computer is old school...,"This may have been a good product back in 2005 when it came out but they have done nothing to keep it current with software advances since then. The DVD's that come with it require an older version of a DVD player that you can't even get anymore (see list at http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/salud/techsupport/index.html). If you try to install/use anything other than what is on thier list(which you can't get anymore), the custom DVD interface that is used won't recognize your player. For instance, WinDVD4 is on the list and this software is now up to version 9!I tried to call and email thier tech support department for a workaround and they haven't responded after a week of repeated attempts.Save your money. I am sending mine back for a refund...."
1,This toy should be recalled,"This review is about the same toy with the little swinging pig on the right hand side. If you get that model after ordering, send it back immediately. It is extremely dangerous to babies. My one-year old got his fingers stuck twice under the balancing pig. Basically, I am not sure why this item is still for sale anywhere and maybe it was par of a hidden recall by Vtech because obviously they have another safer model out."
1,I am not happy about this toy,"I am not happy about this toy, because i was saw in the amazon this toy has different look and feel and it has different futures in the description , but i have received different look and feel , and very less futures and fun. My son is not happy to see this toy."
1,Worked for only one day then no sound,Worked for only one day then no sound nothing more to say we can't use it anymore
2,Ok - but the song is off-key,"My son received this toy for Christmas. At 4 months old he is still a litle young for it - he can't push the buttons or turn the page yet. He does enjoy watching the lights and listening to the animal sounds. However, when I play it with him so he can watch the lights, it drives me CRAZY because the man singing ""Old McDonald Had a Farm"" is singing OUT OF TUNE with the melody playing behind it. Why couldn't they get someone to sing the song correctly?? If I'm going to have to listen to this a million times as he grows up & plays with it, I REALLY WISH it was in the correct tune!!"
1,Danger - Bad Design - Fingers/Hands will be caught/hurt!!!,"Beware - The swinging pig is a danger. Our daughter got her hand/fingers caught on the pig enough times that we are throwing the toy away!Side note - This is the worst sounding toy you will EVER hear!As we are throwing the toy away, I would prefer to give it zero stars, but that is not an option!"
3,"Baby LOVES it, but it is SOOOOOO ANNOYING","First let me start off....my baby never got his finger stuck and looking at the toy, I don't really see how he could. Maybe the design changed.My son loves this toy. It sings songs, teaches colors, animal sounds, animals, numbers, and acts like a piano too.The bad thing. It is SO ANNOYING!!! I am VERY tolerant of my toy noises, but this toy is SO LOUD (even on the quiet setting) and the voices are SO annoying. And if baby keeps pushing buttons it will interupt itself and respond to the button most recently pushed. So it will start to say ""blue liek the pond"", but mid sentense it will stop and say ""oink oink I like mud"".I still let my son play with this toy and I have the music on. THere are just some days when I have had EENOUGH and the toy disappears for awhile.THis would be a great toy to leave at the IN LAWS house if you don't liek them. it will annoy anybody!"
2,Waste of money!!!!,"We bought this for our son last Christmas and it was broken within 3 weeks!!! This is unacceptable for any toy, much less one I paid $20 for!! The page in the middle that switches modes just stopped working for no reason whatsoever. My son has NEVER broken a toy and we own many Fisher Price and LeapFrog toys. I tried to exchange it many many times and the store never got it back in stock. I tried to contact Vtech via email and had my email returned as undeliverable. It was a cute idea, especially how the song ""voice"" changes when you touch a different animal, but with the safety issue with the pig and how hard it is for little ones to move the sheep, it's just not worth it. We bought another Vtech toy last Christmas as well (Sing & Discover Piano) and it broke within 2 months. I will never buy another Vtech toy!! There are much better toys out there. Don't waste your money!!"
4,My nephew had so much fun playing with it.,"My nephew had this toy at 6 month old, and he never had any problem when he play it. When our neighbor's 9 month old girl visit us, she fell in love with it instantly and played with it the whole afternoon. And for that ""off key"" guy's singing, I thought Vtech did it on purpose, it didn't annoy me."
5,Her favorite toy!!!,"My 8 month old daughter LOVES this toy - she's constantly playing with it! There's different animals to move around, different keys to push, a little sun to roll, and a little music book to flip back and forth - there's just so much to do with it. And one of the best parts is that there's a good variety of songs, so it doesn't get old too quickly like some other repetitive music toys. I want more toys like this for her!"
2,too easy to break,"We got this toy for my son. After 2 drops, the thing is not working. Now, which 1 or 2 year old doesn't drop toys? The manufacture should thought of it and makes the toy more durable."
3,harmful,My 15 month old boys hand got stuck where the red pig is at.It was so stuck in there that his babysister couldn't get his hand out. My son literally had to jank his own hand out crying his head off because of it. I recommend that all parents keep a very close I on your child when playing with this toy. Other than the problem that accured with my boy. The toy is very educational and fun for my boy.
3,"Not a great toy, but not bad either","My 14 month old enjoys this toy. It doesn't keep her attention for TOO long, but when she does sit and play with it, she really enjoys it. She loves flipping the book pages and pushing the little sheep down. My only gripe about this toy is it's so loud. Even on the lowest sound setting, it's still pretty loud. And it's one of those toys that don't ""shut up"". It'll play a song, stop, then play again, then stop. We end up just turning the darn thing off. But when she plays with it, she likes it :o)"
1,Dangerous Toy,"My 10 month old son got his finger caught in the swinging pig door on 3 occasions. The final straw was when it took two of us to free his finger from the toy and left him with a black and blue finger the next day. This toy is dangerous. I called the VTECH 800 number to complain/warn them about the poor design of the toy. I dealt with a slow, inept customer service person who told me he would file my complaint and asked ME to call back in a few days to see if any managers replied to my complaint!!! He never even asked me what or how it happened!! Poor customer service, dangerous toys, and a high price for a toy that will hopefully end up in the trash before it breaks some poor kids finger. My rating for this toy and VTECH customer service is 0 stars."
2,Annoying toy,"My 18 month son absolutely loves this toy, but it is the most annoying thing I've ever heard. The guy who sings ""Old Mac Donald"" is terrible and off key. If you don't mind annoying toys then this is the one for you. Also it's one of those toys that when your child is finished playing with it, it attempts to lour them back to play with it some more!"
4,My daughter Loves it,"This was my 6 months old daughter's first electronic toy and she still likes it after a year. The music and animal sounds are great. She plays with it and drops it a lot. Only recently it quit singing after she dropped it from the coffee table. But my husband opened the bottom cover and found that one of the wires was losey. Once he put it back to place, it sings just like always. And the bettery last forever too.It teaches push/swing/roll/slide each animal, flipping the page to learn number/color or songs. The piano keys can play just like the regular piano keys (do-ra-me-fa-so) or it can play songs like what the animal sings as you press on the keys.Made with nice glossy plastic (doesn't look cheap at all), fun musical farm, surely worth the money!!!!"
1,Watch Out For Injuries!!!,"We got this toy for out daughter when she was a year old. She absolutely loved the music and lights and turning the pages on the book...until she got her hand stuck under the swinging pig. Ok, I thought, maybe a fluke. Then it happened 2 more times, and the third time left marks on her hand and wrist. It's going back to v-tech, and they are looking into the problem. Kudo's for them for taking the complaint seriously. I've never had a problem with any other v-tech toys. My daughter will never play with this again."
1,Total junk,Totally unusable.Fell apart the first time I used it.Impossible to repair.Don't bother buying this.One star is too high a rating for this product.
4,not a nine inch gauge,"The contour gauge is only six inches long, not nine as the site states. Besides this problem it is fine for the price. The pins are stiff but still move when needed."
5,Re: Female Poets of the Harlem Renaissance,"This anthology answers the question, who were the female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era? Also, What were they writing? This book printed duirng the 90's successfully answers and is still the definitive book on the subject of female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era. From Angelina Weld Grimke, Helene Johnson to Georgia Douglas Johnson's famous poem, Heart of a Woman, to some of the poets who are not well known, such as Mary Jenness and Ruth Dixon, this book explores the themes of the notable and less notable in poetry. This book is divided into three sections, Protest, Heritage and Love & Passion. This book gives a wonderful taste of poetry with little or no commentary. This is a must read and must have for anyone who has ever contemplated the question, who were the female writers of the period and what did they write? This will answer sufficiently that question or will tease the tongue for more about these poetesses of the era."
2,"bulky, and hard to clean","warning: if you put your computer plug in the nylon mesh side pocket, the mesh will become degraded quickly, while the plug doesn't fit well in the other side pocket. the bulk of this back is my main complaint, the large size is unnecessary unless you have a 15.4"" screen laptop from the nineties."
3,Good value,"I bought 2 to keep one as a backup when the Canon battery gave out on me. They look exactly they same and charged fine. The long term quality of these will determine their worth, but at about 1/4 the cost of the Canon battery, I may still get more time out of these and spend about the same as on the Canon battery."
2,Amazon Price mongering,"Amazon varies the price of these batteries on a daily basis from around $11 to $20. So on that note, screw you amazon for trying to cheat customers out of their surplus.Actual review to come with arrival of batteries, stay tuned."
4,Ultralast UL-BP511,"I bought this battery as a replacement for the OEM battery in my Canon G5. So far it runs very well, takes a charge no problem, and last quite a while. It gets four stars because I have only been using it for a couple weeks, and still could die, but so far it is a good performer.The only complaint I have is the company that handled the mailing, would add ANOTHER $6.00 for EACH battery shipped. This is a complete rip-off, as it wouldn't in reality cost any more to send four batteries, than it would to send one, AND it was sent 1st class, not Priority, and for $6.00 it should have gone Priority. The shipping is a complete scam, buy it local if you can."
3,The battery works fine,"The battery works fine has allowed me to take over 50 6Mp pictures on a single charge. On problem however, is the indicator on the camera only shows the battery to be half full even when the battery is fully charged."
2,Doesn't last as long as original,"Doesn't last as long as the original. It probably last about 300 pictures on my 30D (with review off the battery is shown low after 200 pictures or so, I guess it can still go on for a short while)"
3,Get what you pay for!,"These batteries are a bargain but don't expect them to last as long as the one that came with your camera. I first noticed the battery completely discharged after sitting a week or two after I'd shot a few pictures. That never happened before. A full charge simply doesn't last as long. You'll want to carry a spare. If you've got the jack, go for the one from Canon. If you're not a pro, this battery will do you for awhile for less money."
1,Doesn't hold a charge,"This battery won't hold a charge! That's what I get for buying no-name batteries. I'll buy name-brand from now on, I guess."
2,Received wrong battery,"I purchased 2 of these batteries for our Canon Digital Rebel and received 2 batteries of a different brand/voltage/mah. I'm not interested in working to resolve the issue as the batteries do work, but I will not purchase from this vendor again."
2,Not quite there,The specifications claim to have capasity bigger than the original OEM battery however I was able to take 600 pictures on the fully charged battery. For comparison 'smaller' OEM battery gives me more than a thousand. I will keep it in a bag for a while as an emergency power supply but this is not an equal replacement for the genuine Canon battery.
4,I can't see spending 40 bucks...,"...for a 5 year old digital camera. I was a little nervous about using something other than the OEM battery, but so far so good... Works like a charm."
4,Not bad to have,"Not bad to have for substitute battery only, I am not sure it would stays life longer than the original one. It works well for my camera though, I got it almost 8 months already."
3,Would have been 4 stars but it doesnt last as long,"I bought the battery as a backup for my 10and30ds. I'll keep this shortPros:quick charge, works well, perfect fit, CHEAP!!!!!Cons:battery goes faster than other batteries. It gets through a 2hour shoot just fine. But by the time your done.. so is the battery:) Looking @ it i think it's bc the battery is rated @ 7.2V. The official canon battery is rated @ 7.4V. That things lasts forever! :)results:I'd recomend it as a spare battery. I'd even get another one just for that purpose. The price more than justifies the battery life for me. I just keep my chargers close :)I hope this helps"
5,As good or better!,This replacement is as good or better than the original that came with the camera. Charges well and holds a charge at least as well as the original battery. There is no lag time in taking photos and I have no reason to think it won't continue to be as good!!!
5,Canon BP-511 Equivalent,Used in my Canon EOS Rebel with 4 GB card. Over 300 photos taken before it registered any battery level change. Well worth the price.
4,Camcorder battery,The camcorder batter works fine. It is nice to have a backup when filming something long like a wedding. It was much cheaper than some other brands.
4,Works!,"So far so good. Does what it's supposed to, and seems to have a similar battery life as the original canon. Haven't used it extensively, but for the amount i have used it, it works very well, especially for the price!"
5,so far so good,little worried at first no problems so far.. working in the battery grip on my 40d gets about 2000 pics.. great price
5,Good OEM Battery,"I found the Ultralast battery to work well in my Canon SLR. I have only put it through a couple of charge cycles, but it seems as good as the original."
3,Shipping Charges!,"I was going to order 10 of these batteries, and I figured the shipping charge would be a flat rate for the entire order. Not so. This seller charges $4.99 for EACH BATTERY, no matter how many you order.So, be aware that the total cost for these batteries is $7.24 each."
1,Do not buy this battery!!,I bought this battery as a replacement for my Canon Digital Rebel - I charged it and used it one time and now it will not take a charge no matter how many times I try. So for me the purchase was a waste of money.
1,Won't hold a charge,"When input it in the charger, it appears to be charging, but when I try to use it in the camera it only will turn on for a few seconds, then dies. I have only been able to take one picture with it. Not happy with this product."
1,Disappointing performance,"Bought this to replace the original battery in my aging Canon Powershot G2. Battery had to be constantly charged after just a few months use as it barely held a charge, dying just minutes after a few shutter clicks and,causing me to miss some good shots. Had to resort to the original battery which is finally on its way out after many years of faithful service."
5,What If You're Standing B y the Sixteenth Round,Hurricane takes you deep into an unbelievable world of a corrupt justice system and a boxer fighting his greatest battle of all behind bars. Hirsch allows the facts to drive the story but his eloquent writing brings the scenes to life creating both an emotional and visual experience.
4,My Journey to Rubin,"I loved this book almost as much as I loved the movie. For me it was one more step to tracking down the man, the legend. This is a wonderful book for anyone to read, from juveniles through senior citizens. The justice that eventually prevailed is of the feel good sort. It was such an incredible coming together of so many elements. I think that it should be included on recommended booklists in middle and elementary schools."
3,A bit slanted,"I found this book fascinating, if a bit slanted. There were many questions about Carter's case left unanswered. Overall, however, it is a good story about a man who was wronged by the American judicial system and who managed to survive in and then out of prison. Carter is neither hero nor victim, but a man who has had an incredible life journey and who has managed to grow despite all odds. I pray that his courageous journey continues for many years."
4,Great story,If one does not have access to a good lawyer: This is what happens. I still can not understand how Mr.Carter found the strength to keep his fight ?!
2,Not at all what I expected.... having seen the movie,"After having been moved to tears by the movie ""Hurricane"", wherein Denzel Washington portrayed the long-suffering, wrongly accused, beaten down Rubin Carter, I fully expected to be further moved by this book.It was not to be! In fact, this book pointed out the much less glamorous and hard side of Mr. Carter. The movie romanticized a person the book reveals to have been a rather unloveable, sometimes mean, ugly human being.I came to love Mr. Washington's version of Hurricane Carter, I can only fear the one in this book.Did your mama ever tell you, ""I don't know what you did but I know you did something."" Did you get spankings for things you may not have done, only to know that you really had done something even worse? Well, I think Mr. Carter served time for a crime he didn't commit, but in all probability deserved to serve time for crimes not discovered by the authorities."
1,Very Slanted Book,"This book, while well-written, is a factual travesty. Hurricane Carter was convicted twice for these murders, the second time by a racially mixed jury.There is plenty of evidence to indicate that Carter was absolutely guilty, and the book is at variance with many known facts of the case.I strongly suggest that anyone who reads this book also read some of the other, well-researched works that offer a contrary view.Frankly, I prefer to reserve my compassion for the victims of evil, rather than its perpetrators."
4,pretty good,"This book was pretty good. It was kind of long. I thought the Harry Potter books were better. The Bob Dylan song ""Hurricane"" was great."
1,Racism in a different cover,"The book is actually good, but carries too many cry baby racism references. It's time africans forget about the past and live for their own future. Slavery has been banned for over 120 years. How long will it take us to free ourselves?"
4,From the book review in the California Journal of Law,"This is an exhaustively detailed account of the life of Rubin ""The Hurricane"" Carter, told in a compelling, fluid style. Great detail is given not only the the life of Rubin Carter, but of all those persons involved in Mr. Carter's decades long struggle for freedom after having been twice wrongly convicted for a 1966 triple murder. The background detail of places and events provides an impressive depth and understanding of the political undercurrents and feelings of the day. Mr. Carter has strong feelings about the criminal justice system in the United States, and a strong basis for those feelings. Mr. Hirsch's meticulously researched 'hurricane' provides the reader with a well written 'Journey' not only of, but with Rubin Carter."
4,A solid hits package from a great talent,"This latest Laura Branigan compilation is a definite improvement over the last 1995 collection, restoring a few missing tracks and removing the bloat that kept that previous hits CD from rockin. Yes, it would have been nice to have Hold Me and All Night With Me included, as many have stated, but what greatest hits is without a gap or two? The important thing is the little word REMASTERED, never before used on a Laura hits CD, even the pretty cool European ""Very Best Of"" released in the early 90s. This one is a keeper, great for the curious as well as the hard core fans (who obviously own all her albums anyway). Pop it into the car stereo, pump the volume and get ready to cruise the night with the glorious voice of a true talent in your ears."
4,"Overly melodramatic at times, but still great...","The sound quality is great on this cd, vastly improved over the 1995 BEST OF BRANIGAN.The hits, for the most part, are here. But, I really would have loved to have seen a COMPLETE greatest hits with the other 2 charted singles ""Hold Me"" and ""All Night With Me"" and maybe left off ""Never In A Million Years"". Also would have been nice to have included a few from her now out-of-print 1993 ""OVER MY HEART"" cd (""Over You"", ""How Can I Help You Say Goodbye"", ""Didn't We Almost Win It All""). It's great to get the hits all together on one cd, and it would have made this a 5 star rating had they included all the hits. Very interesting to hear the songs she did first, only to have others take them and do better on the charts (""I Found Someone"" by Cher, ""The Power of Love"" by Celine Dion & ""How Am I Supposed To Live Without You"" by Michael Bolton.).Very unfortunate choice in the cover picture...the 80's weren't always tasteful!"
1,The Rage of an Old Lady...Signifying Nothing!!,"Helen Thomas is an embarrasment. Plain and simple. She is no national treasure. She is no pillar of the press. She is however, a symbol of what the White House Press Corps has become...a drumbeat for the Left, a wing of the DNC and an irrelevancy in the journalistic history of the Republic. Their bias against the current administration is so great that they have lost credibility with main stream America. For far too many years, Ms. Thomas considered herself the pom pom girl of the press corps.At eighty-six and relegated to the back of the room and mostly ignored she has raised the only voice she has left to once more vilify Bush and castigate the other members of the press corps for not being even more outrageous than they already are.The Lefties here apparently love the book. Let them waste their money on it. Save yours."
3,"OK, not great","The highlight of this book are the anecdotes that Ms. Thomas relates. Most of the book is a series of essays about what is wrong with journalism today, with White House press relations and certain presidents and other government officials past and present. Other than the anecdotes and some interesting history there is little that is not intuitive. I agree with a lot of what Ms. Thomas writes, I just don't find it very original or new or presented in a new/unique manner. Save your money and borrow it from a library as I'm not sure I spent my money well in buying this book. FWIW, it is well written and is a fast not-long read."
4,Good product- beware the 1/8 pieces.,"I bought for my daughter for her kitchen set we got for Christmas- she's almost 3 and she put the 1/8 piece in her mouth. Though it's too big to choke on, I wouldn't take any chances, so I put that one away until she is bigger."
3,Not what we wanted,"I purchased this toy in addition to Small World Living Toys My-Oh-My Pizza Pie for my two year old son. I wanted a pizza set that could add to his Ikea kitchen fun and maybe something that could double as educational later. Once I received both sets I was very disappointed in this one. Don't get me wrong I love Learning Resources products, they are always great quality as is this pizza set, but it should not really be labeled as a toy but more of an educational tool. The pizzas are very small and I don't see why any child would want to ""play"" with it, and being that he's only two I have some time before he's learning fraction and this set would then come of any use. I would buy it if I needed it for educational purposes because again it is great quality but NOT as a toy."
3,A good alternative,"Great product - although a bit pricey, better then having to buy a new can w/ a lousy pour spout."
4,Cute color,"I was intrigued by the unique burnt orange color since I've never seen that color before. It's not a disappointment, you could mix and match these shoes with any outfits. They are very comfortable, and they are not too high for me anyways I'm used to wearing 4 1/4 inch heels. I have a very nice collection of shoes and these were exactly the color that i was looking for to add to my collection. It's a must buy, you will not regret it."
4,Surprisingly comfortable!,"Nine West Lucero- the most beautiful pump I've seen in a long time! I was nervous about the heel height, but found them to be fairly easy to wear and true to size. My only reservation is they're a bit snug in the toes; perhaps that's why they're easy to wear- I feel like they're glued to my feet..."
3,Not comfortable at all,"The shoes I received were a pale pink with very thin, horizontal stripes. I didn't mind the look, what bothered me was how hard it was to walk in these shoes. They might be more comfortable in bigger sizes, but at 7.5, they're just too wobbly (the lack of sole traction doesn't help either).No matter how cheap and pretty, bad shoes aren't worth the trouble, so they went back.I gave them 3 stars for the look."
1,What product???,"I received the wrong product. I ordered peppermint and was sent lavender ..and when I contacted the customer service e-mail twice, they did not respond, so I had to file a claim through Amazon. A first impression is a lasting impression. I will never do business with them again."
4,yahoo for come on now social,"great cd. the girls have come a long way and the differences between them are glowing on this cd. amy's folky sounding ""gone again"" and ""ozilline"" are heartwarming as ever, and emily's ""andy"" is one of her most beautiful. emily goes more electric on this album and amy more acoustic, so it evens out nicely. if you're looking for something that sounds like anything they've done before, this album is definitely a growth from their past and is very different. the girls are not afraid to try new things, which is great to witness. i love it!"
5,"Great album, long overdue...","The Indigo Girls had plenty of talent and plenty to say as demonstrated on every album prior to this one. For better or worse it was channeled into a predictable form that left few guessing what the next album would sound like... and then along comes Come On Now Social. Full of new life, the girls kicked out an extraordinary album that outshone all but perhaps their self titled album and Nomads Indians Saints. Its strength is its variety. Amy and Emily explore new musical textures that give their always powerful lyrics a fresh voice. From the surprising, exhilarating crunch of Go to the spooky overtones of Faye Tucker (both by Amy Ray, the more adventurous of the two) Come On Now Social is a bright star, highly recommended to fans and newcomers alike."
2,A big ol' jumble...,"There is nothing on the new album that makes me feel alive or that I can connect with. The only song that comes close is ""Gone Again"", but even then it's sort of ""drippy"". This seventh set doesn't really seem like a unified whole and one of the most interesting songs is buried after the horrid ""Faye Tucker"" as a hidden track. Why the hell do artists create hidden tracks and then announce on the cover that there's a hidden track?So, overall, I would say that I'm waiting for the next album, because when I'm in my car, I have absolutely no desire to pop this one in the CD player.I'm seeing them on Sunday, December 5th. I'm only hoping they play more older stuff (i.e. Ghost & Watershed)."
4,Better than Their Other Recent Releases,"Well, if the days of Strange Fire and Nomads, Indians and Saints are gone, it's comforting to see they have been overtaken by this CD. Despite the bizarre title, the songs are varied, interesting, and they prove something I have always known - Emily can rock! I have always thought her voice had the greater range, but she really gets to demonstrate that here. I also commend them on deciding to work with a musical genius such as Me'shell Ndegeocello - nothing those three would put together could possibly be bad. Thanks for getting me excited about Indigo Girls music again!"
5,The Girls have done it again!,"I must admit: when I first put this CD in my player I was shocked and taken aback. As a long time fan of the Indigo Girls, I was expecting a more ""unplugged"" sound...instead it was Shaming of the Sun on steroids. I wasn't sure if I liked it just yet and took the CD out. Now, after having seen the Girls in concert over the weekend, I LOVE IT! Seeing them perform the songs from this album live really did it for me...and motivated me to listen to the rest of the album. One word sums it up: WOW! Although I still love their older stuff, this album rocks! I like the way their music is heading...you can still hear their roots in the sounds. Rites of Passage is still my favorite of their albums, but this has got to be number two. Get this album...fan or not. You won't be disappointed."
4,Is this their swan song?,"I'm a devoted fan of the Girls, and they're the only group whose releases I rush to the store to get on the first day they're available. However, I was extremely disappointed by 97's Shaming of the Sun - thought it showed their weaknesses, not their strengths. So I'm heartened by Come On Now... since it seems to be a return to their previous equisite form, at least on ""Soon Be to Nothing"" and ""Gone Again."" But I don't know why they're so determined to be electric guitar players, when it doesn't seem to be where their strengths are (I always thought they wrung more emotion and aggression out of acoustics than lesser musicians did with the volume all the way up). I don't think growth and change are a bad thing, I just think they are losing what makes them special in favor of sounding more like everything else, and that's a sad thing, because in their history, they have created some of the most beautiful and meaningful pop/folk music ever made."
4,Awesome!,"This record blew me away. It's pushing the envelope musically while still staying with their consistent philosophies. I LOVE ALL OF THE GUESTS - CROW is awesome! Besides the classics, musically I think this is one of their best efforts. These girls are awesome! Lilith did them goooooood! Go see them in concert whenever you can, it's worth every nickel."
4,INDIGOS ROCKIN IT !!!!!,WELL ITS LIKE THIS ..TALENT IS TALENT AND THE WORDS ARE WONDERFUL AND THE MUSIC CREATIVE AND UNIQUE.THE MESSAGES SEEM TO BE THROWN RIGHT IN OUR FACE AND THATS FINE WITH ME CAUSE THEY ROCK IT TO ME THIS TIME SO THE WHOLE THING FLOWS JUST RIGHT.BUT WHERE ARE THE FOLKIES IVE COME TO LOVE?THE POETRY THAT LEFT ME CONTEMPLATING THE MESSAGE LONGER THAN THESE LYRICS WILL?BUT ITS HOT STUFF AND WITH EVERY ALBUM IM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO FINE.
3,Some stong songs. Very different from previous CDs,"This new CD is a little hard to listen at first because the songs are so different from previous songs the Indigo Girls have done. However, they are already starting to grow on me and I am sure that I will like it a lot more by the end of the week. There are some great stand out songs that will become classics (Go, Gone Again, Peace Tonight, Faye Tucker, and the hidden track Philosophy of Loss). I would definitely recommend this cd to Indigo Girls fans but for people are buying on of their cds for the first time I would recommend Swamp Ophelia or Rites of Passage instead."
3,"Good ""Social"" Tunes","I wouldn't consider myself a fan of the IG's but have always respected them as artists and having the courage to make music on their own terms. I have a few IG cd's and they are ok enough background music. A friend gave me ""Come On Now Social"" a couple of months ago and I resisted listening to it until recently and when I did get around to it I must say I'm surprised that I like it as much as I do - but still pretty much standard issue IG. I agree with other reviewers here that solo projects are probably in order as I think they have done well to take their music as far as they have and should quit or take a long break while it is still remotely interesting."
4,Age does not inhibit the girls at all,"It's been quite awhile since the girls released their self-titled album for Epic. Since then they've released numerous titles, all of which have had their strengths and weaknesses. CONS is no different.I really liked some of the titles on this album. The opening title by Amy, ""Go"" is a great song, perfect for getting the blood going in the body, perfectly balanced by the second track by Emily, ""Soon Be to Nothing"".However, the end of the album distressed me, as the last few tracks seemed more to me like they were just putting some songs on to fill time. I was not really particularly keen on the hidden track at the end of the album either.All in all however it was another fine performance by the girls, and I look forward to their next album."
4,Oh Ozilline,"If you are a fan of their earlier works, this review may be meaningful. ""Come On Now Social"" seemed to bring on the same inquietude of ""Shaming in the Sun"". Then I concentrated on the story of ""Ozilline"". The lyrics shivered my bones like a wet dog caught in an Arctic rain. Yes!"
2,Where are Indigo Girls?,"I must agree with ""granitegrabber"" of SF. When I listened to the album I asked myself the same questions. The pure magic and excitement of their harmonies, lyrics and blended guitar styles is missing from this album. After listening to it a second time, I spent the rest of the evening listening to ""Strange Fire"" and ""Nomads, Indians and Saints"". I wanted to hear and enjoy the Indigo Girls. That's where I found them."
2,"Weak, unimaginative fluff","I've been enjoying IG for a decade but this release is nearly awful. Every song Emily contributed is embarrassingly bad. Some of Amy's work is okay, most notably ""Gone Again."" Buy something else."
5,What a woman really wants is love,"Forget perfume! Read me words of love.A History of Light is straight from a bottomless well of the real stuff. This is the intensity, recklessness and sweetness I want from a lover. The innocence and abandon of a twelve year-old boy's first headlong plunge into his own heart, told over fifty years later with the seasoning and wisdom of a poet.Light the candles. Pour the wine. Turn the page. Read me words of love."
5,NIL8 is the JOINT,"If you don't have this album your cheating yourself. Seriously. Go put yourself on punishment RIGHT NOW for not owning it. After your done in the corner, come back and buy this album."
5,Another great N.I.L.8 album,"Eunuch is the band's 2nd best album (after Doug). Brothers Bruce & Jeff Williams have consistantly come out with great punk-funk albums over the years, and this one is no exception. Highlights include ""Porno Star"", ""Hobgobblinspookadelic"" (named after their annual Halloween shows in Springfield, IL), ""mineral spirits"", ""Nothing to Laugh about"" - Heck, the whole album is impressive. It's also the last album to feature Lance Reynolds on drums. Lance went on to produce such bands as The Blue Meanies, Alkaline Trio, And most recently the Junior Varsity.If you get the chance, see N.I.L.8 live. Along with the Urge from St. Louis, they are one of the most high energy bands you'll get the chance to see."
5,I became the office expert and I'm not a nerd. Thanks Phil!,"The quick reading section in the beginning got me up to speed very quickly and then allowed me to gradually get to the details at my leisure. The details were understandable and they kept my interest till the very end. Steinman's understasnding of this compliticated subjest as well as the indepth research on government, industry and even biblical implications was impressive. I would like to have a conversation with Mr. Steinman. That would be quite stimulating."
4,Lasso the Wind,"Eagan as usual is right on.This book involves the States that make up the ""west"" of the U.S. It is a history of our rape and pillage of the resources especially water and some ideas for the future. It is an enjoyable and informative read divided into chapters each a different state or region."
2,Decent read with some fact-checking needed.,"I found this book to be enjoyable until I read the essay titled: ""Top of the food chain"". In a passage describing the breathless wonder of disovering a cougar track in Idaho, Timmy scribbles: ""They are long gone from Europe."" I was on the verge of shedding a tear over the extinct European cougar when I remembered that COUGARS NEVER LIVED IN EUROPE OUTSIDE OF ZOOS! Yep, cougars are unique to the new world, a fact that shouldn't slip by this author or his editors. It is an insult to the reader for an author to be so sloppy."
1,Conventional Prejudice,"I received the book as a gift, but it only took me one chapter to wish I hadn't received it. I personally know something of what that chapter is about, and to my disappointment the author was not only inaccurate, shallow and unintelligent in his analysis, but he is solidly locked into the conventional prejudices one would expect, I suppose, from a writer for the N.Y. Times -- the typical liberal urbanite arrogance towards people who live on the land and work with their hands close to nature, people who produce the resources we depend on. The author thinks he is demolishing myths, but actually he succumbs to the latest trendy myths of his social set."
1,Just to let you know why you lost a sale,"Text to speech not enabled = my money not spent on your product.Respect the consumer, jerk."
3,Mostly Good,"Three stars may be unfair to this book but I gave it three stars because it's chapters cover different regions of Southwest history. Each chapter is independent and covers the history of a different, but interesting, area of the Southwest. If you live in, or are interested in the Southwest U.S., you will probably enjoy this book. I live in Arizona and have done a lot of travel in the Southwest. I read the whole book but was only interested in some of the areas covered particularly those that I had visited. Those particular chapters I would give 5 stars but other chapters that I had no interest in would only rate a 1 or 2 stars, not because it wasn't well written but because I just wasn't interested in that particular area. Due to the way the book is divided it's hard to give it a star rating. I would suggest checking out what areas are of interest to you and if they are covered in the book you will enjoy the interesting historical perspectives."
3,Nice looking ball,"This is a nice looking ball by Puma, however, it is not a high quality ball that would be used for games. A decent practice ball, but after a little more than one year of regular use the adhesive cover (synthetic leather) is peeling off. Has held its shape well, though. A good buy at the price."
5,Great gift idea!,"My husband and son-in-law both loved their handmade chocolate ""tools"" this Christmas. The mold is durable, washes easily, and the chocolates pop out easily as well. Great mold!"
5,The Best Children's Book Ever!,"This was my favorite book when I was little, and I have read the entire book many times. It collects some of the best short stories, nursery rhymes, and fables in children's literature into one fabulous book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves stories, but children especially will be pleased with the content and the excellent illustrations. This is a book that everyone should have in their collection. You won't regret it!"
1,No bass,"I'm not sure if it's just the one i got, but the bass is non-existent. Returning and will update review if the new one works well."
4,Not Bad,This album is funny but can get annoying at times. What started as a joke on Biggi's album progressed into a debut album for The Madd Rapper. I wonder if he's going to tour in this persona. It's not a bad album and the colaborations with the other artist really made the album. Not a bad pick considering he rolls with Puff Daddy.
1,This may have been the worst,"When I looked at the back of the Madd Rapper's album with its numerous guest artists, I was very hopeful about the quality. Though I had never heard any of the singles, I bought the cd to listen on a road trip. This is one of the worst rap albums that I have ever heard. The Madd Rapper had annoying repeative choruses that remind me of the highly dissapointing new Puffy album. With the exception of ""Stir Crazy"" with Eminem, there are not even any average songs on this album. He can not rap with the beats, most of which are inadequate and not in the is least bit catchy. I would not recomend this album to any one."
2,Anyone Care Why He's Mad? Didn't Think So.,"Hey, look, Bad Boy put out another wack album! But this is actually enjoyable at times. Why, you ask? Well, c'mon, when you've got an MC who sounds like he didn't make it past the second grade, you've got something rather fun to laugh at. First off, he thinks he's so damn cool because he can't spell mad. Second, his lyrics are so pitiful that I wonder why anyone actually waste 13 hard-earned dollars on it. I was surprised by one shining point, though. Picasso Black, one of the featured artists, is trying to step forward in the sea of mainstream hip-hop and spread POSITIVE MESSAGES. Jay-Z, Dre, DMX, take after his lead! Oh, wait, that'd be impossible, they might not go 5765354 times platinum. But I'm going to have to look out for this Picasso character. But, in the meantime, find a way to download the track with him on it, and don't bother buying this CD, which would actually make a better drink coaster. PEACE!"
1,Anyone who loved the classic Jane Eyre will hate this book.,Takes the character of Mr. Rochester and turns him into a monster. Cheap rip-off of a great classic. Worthless.
1,Descent into madness,"Wide Sargasso Sea is a reworking and reanalysing of Jane Eyre's contrast Bertha. The style is careful with every line potentially meaningful. Antoinette, Bertha's real name, is a worthy character to mould and examine. Rochester is worth having a dig at. After all, he is an aristocratic, morally obstinate, brick in Jane Eyre so he's no different in Wide Sargasso Sea. The dig is aimed at the British Empire and the problems that slavery brought.As some other reviews state Wide Sargasso Sea is a modern classic, with modernists twists and turns and psychological analysis. It's not depressive but realistic and a valuable expression of the author's intentions."
1,Great.....if you're into masochism,I did not read this book out of choice...it was cruelly forced upon me by the board of education. I am extremely upset by Jean Rhys' lack of originality in molesting characters immortalised by Charlotte Bronte in her classic. This book was painful to endure.....it is much better used as firewood.
1,Disappointing and a drag,"I suppose my expectations were high for this pseudo-prequel to ""Jane Eyre."" The Jamaican dialect and colloqualisms made it difficult to follow, similar to Alice Walker's ""Color Purple."" In fact, I returned this to the library before finishing it. I had hoped for better"
2,Disappointed,"I'm not picky about the shape books are in when I receive them - if it lines up with what the seller says the state is. After receiving a supposedly ""USED - VERY GOOD"" copy of Wide Sargasso Sea, I was shocked to find multiple pages water damaged and the cover very torn and in bad shape. I didn't mind the pages being written on (I always feel it adds character to a used book), but the seller should have warned customers about the damage. Overall, disappointed. I'm just glad it got here promptly."
1,The Downfall of Literature,If I were to live my life without having to read this novel again I would die a very happy man. Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea is one of the worst novels I've read in my life time and reading this could be compared to listining to fingernails scrape across a chalk board. It is compleatly incoherent with just a touch of insanity. I'm sure if Charlotte Bronte had read this she would have wished she had never written Jane Eyre.
2,"a tough, unsatisfying read","I found this book to be more trouble than it was worth. It was a tedious boring insght into the character of Bertha, Rochester's wife in Elizabeth Bronte's Jane Eyre. Rhys should have left well enough alone"
2,blech,"Generally, I read classics written by female authors. Therefore, I was quite excited to read this one because it has been touted as a wonderful novel in its own right AND an interesting prequel to ""Jane Eyre."" I was pretty sure that I could not go wrong with this choice.Oh well. While some books have something for everyone, this book has something to disappoint almost everyone. The writing was O.K., but it is nothing special. The characters are thinly developed. The plot is scanty and of little consequence. Ms. Rhys also set the book in time so that it could not align with the plot of ""Jane Eyre."" I can only assume that the linkage was a notional attempt at PR.While the novel is short, so is life. Don't waste yours on this one."
4,A sensuous novel,"This is a sensuous novel that tells the moving story of Antoinette Cosway and her life in post-colonial W. Indies. The setting is richly described, and the tragic heroine arouses a great deal of sympathy. The novel is fairly short and easy to read. Apparently the central character represents a character in Jane Eyre, which I did not know before I read the book. I have not read Jane Eyre, and so I do not know if this piece of information adds anything to the novel."
1,not really good,The book was not really in the advertised condition. Can't complain too much because the price was so low...but for $8 in shipping you'd think it could come pretty quickly (ordered two books from the same seller...charged me two shipping fees).
2,"Atmospheric, but Dull","This book is a reworking of Jane Eyre by a Creole writer. It drags on and on, employing multiple narrative perspectives, shifting from one to the next and back again. Very atmospheric with strong pathos throughout, I just didn't enjoy the story. Don't expect to be uplifted. The plot just dragged on towards the inevitable. Rochester was not at all a sympathetic character. If Jane Eyre created a wronged madwoman and left her in the attic after a brief visit, Wide Sargasso Sea creates an absolutely mean Rochester whose behavior seems too manufactured as a feminist revenge."
3,An intriguing and exotic novel that adds a twist to JaneErye,"The Book Wide Sargasso Sea is an interesting novel based on the background of the character ""Bertha"" in the book Jane Erye. It is a romantic tale that intrigues the reader. I thought it was an exotic tale. It was an enjoyable read, but I can't say that I would read it again. There are more enjoyable pleasure novels out there. If you really love Jane Erye and are looking for a free reading book than I would suggest this. If you didn't really enjoy Jane Erye and aren't into exotic books than this isn't the book for you."
4,prequel to Jane Eyre intriques...,"'Wide Sargasso Sea' is certainly an interesting read. Although a prequel to 'Jane Eyre', it can be read on its own merit. The story is about a rather disturbed young woman in the West Indies and her husband who both tries to understand and escape from her. The author captures the time period (1830s) perfectly and has obviously researched the lifestyle and the language of the local people. She is also a brilliant writer; her prose and characterizations are of a high caliber. Yet since much of the book is written in the first person of a stressed, emotionally unstable woman, I found it sometimes difficult to catch all the subtle nuances. Thankfully there are appendices in the back of the book which proved most helpful.Bottom line: a very different, at times difficult, but very remarkable piece of literature."
2,confused,This story is confusing and keeps shifting from one thing to the other. It wasn't what I expected it to be. I think it should have been better thought out. It doesn't make much sense and is not entertaining.
4,A.P Should make us read more books this great,"This is the first book I have had to read for Senior A.P English, and I couldn't have been happier. This book is the sequel to Jane Eyre. The reader gets to hear of Bertha's story, whom they meet in Jane Eyre. The book has a slower narrative pace, yet it continously flows. The novel is a quick read and well-written."
2,It seemed completely irrelevent.,"It seemed completely irrelevent. The descriptive nature of the novel, however, made it ever so slightly bearable. How anybody reads the book strictly for entertainment is beyond me."
2,provides a clear and coherent argument but lacks interest,"I had been told of this book and was eager to read it, but was disappointed by it. It gives the tale of Antoinette Mason (Rochester's wife) in *Jane Eyre*, and in describing the background and life of ""the madwoman in the attic,"" argues against the values implicit and explicit in the Bronte novel. But these characters are not compelling. The book is an argument, not a vivid novel that pulls the reader into its vortex. If I want an argument, I can read literary theory or criticism."
2,Literary Fan Fiction,"This is a work of 'literary fan fiction'. I've read and enjoyed Jane Eyre, so I went into reading this supposed response and continuation optimistically. I was even excited about it, but the novel falls short, I think, of any and all of its established purposes. It is entirely didactic (though perhaps not as blatant as an Ayn Rand novel, for example), and so seems to be almost completely disassociated from the source material it claims to pay homage to.Jane Eyre was, I think we can agree, a very successful and effective feminist novel, it approached the subject with bravery and intent, but also with caution. Wide Sargasso Sea takes that theme and flat out runs with it, making itself out to be a post-modernist novel that is entirely too self aware of its post-modernism. It takes itself far too seriously, which is surprising because all Rhys really did was take provided, popular characters, and figure out a back-story for them. I'm not impressed."
4,Beautifully written,"This short book is beautifully written, with fully drawn characters in an historical, social context. Very sad, though."
3,Nit-Picking the Sea.,"This novel was a challenge, but I suppose it was worth the effort. However, I found six major errors between Wide Sargasso Sea and its ""mother book"" Jane Eyre.Top 6 Discrepancies1. Antoinette's age / Rochester's age 2. Letters sent back to England 3. Rochester's feelings for Antoinette 4. Richard Mason's relationship to Antoinette 5. Time spent before wedding 6. Rochester after Bertha's attack on RichardI don't include the descriptions, as I do not wish to spoil it for anyone. It is a worthwhile read, but I wholeheartedly reccomend Jane Eyre first."
4,moods as varied as the skies over the West Indies,"With her vivid imaginative skills, Jean Rhys offers us the tale of ""Bertha"" Rochester, the madwoman in the attic of ""Jane Eyre."" The skies of the West Indies are an ever-changing backdrop in this moody novel of fear, memory, and desire. Rhys' style challenges the reader to ""fill in the blanks"" many times throughout, making necessary intuitive connections to amplify her sometimes sparse prose. What could have been merely a lightweight story of ""love and greed in the tropics"" turns into an engaging, beautifully unfolding narrative laden with mystery and sadness."
4,Clever little book.,"I picked up this story because I'm working my way through Time's 100 All Time Best Novels, not realizing that it was intended to be a prequel to Bronte's Jane Eyre, and was pleasantly surprised.Rhys took issue with Bronte's character Mrs. Rochester, who was of Carribbean descent like Rhys herself (Creole), and set out to create a story that explains how that tragic figure came to be. In Rhys' tale, the original Mrs. Rochester (the young Antoinette Cosway) had a relatively happy, whimsical beginning in the West Indies, but was eventually driven to madness by a combination of racism, sexism, and colonial oppression. Derided by black and white residents alike for her Creole heritage, and stripped of material belongings by her English husband, she ends up the ""mad woman in the attic"" that Bronte describes.It's a short novel, told from both Antoinette's and her husbands point of view, but rich with social commentary."
3,"A tour de force, but not as powerful as Rhys' other novels","Wide Saragasso Sea has tended to receive more attention and praise than Rhys' other books, perhaps because it is a tour de force, and/or because it was this novel that finally brought her recognition at the age of 76 (though she claimed to be only 72!). But for immediacy, power, a worm's-eye view of the ugliness and power politics that underly so many so-called human interactions, and above all prose that reads as though the main character is literally turned inside out -- as though the skin has been burned off and all we get is pure feeling -- I think Rhys' other novels, particularly Good Morning Midnight and Voyage in the Dark and After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie, are actually better."
3,LEFT ME ADRIFT,"I now know (AFTER reading the book) that there is a Jane Eyre tie-in. Would I have liked the book better if I had read Jane? The book had the feeling of a mystery. It didn't spoon feed you. I kept going back to reread previous chapters. It was a look at a woman who was damaged in youth and never had a chance at fulfillment. Good look at what it was like to be white in a black majority culture in the early 1800s. Interesting, but not upbeat."
2,"Liked the ""idea"" of the book, not the actuality","This book was ""almost"" a very good book, but something was off. What Rhys did well was portray the sensual atmosphere of Jamaica and the paranoia/confusion/disjointedness of mental illness. Attempting to understand and identify with the characters can almost make the reader feel as if she herself is mentally disturbed. While this is an original attempt in writing, I felt unconnected to this book. I didn't feel I truly understood either Antoinette or Rochester's motivations or personalities, and as such I did not really care what happened in the book. I liked the ""idea"" of the book -- i.e. examining a character made famous in literature through another perspective. If you also like that ""idea,"" then I recommend the book ""Wicked"" by Gregory Maguire which tells the story of the Wicked Witch of the West through another perspective."
2,Re-read Jane Eyre instead,"Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead."
5,glad to have read it,i had to read this book my senior year in high school and i'm glad i did. this is a novel about the strength lost by a young girl the same as her mother did. it end in much unhappiness and misery. but for some reason you walk away with not only a sense of justice but of happiness. happiness for the young girl because she finally got some peace.
2,Overrated,"One of the most overrated ""classics"" in literature. This ""prequel"" to JANE EYRE does little to illuminate the insane Bertha. Okay, so Rouchester is a terrible, awful, vindictive, Euro-centric pig . . . Didn't we already get that in JANE EYRE? Just because he's the ""hero"" doesn't make him, well, a hero we should look up to.Supposedly, Rhys spent YEARS writing and rewriting this curiously weak, empty, underwhelming novel. I'll stop short of suggesting that she wrote it simply to capitalize on the popularity of JANE EYRE.One of the book's saving graces is Rhys' vivid decriptions of the Caribbean setting: the colors and textures and culture. But it isn't enough to justify this novel's label as a masterpiece."
2,Very confusing but I caught on.,"you should read this book before you read Jane Eyre because then you will get the full extent of the story behind the story. I really did not have a favorite part about this book because the whole story was horrible when you really look at it, I mean you have racism and hatred in families and neighborhoods it acually how I look at the world today."
2,a poor defense,"Okay, so Bertha Mason was treated awfully in Charlotte Bront?'s Jane Eyre. Point taken. But Jean Rhys does an exceptionally poor job at defending Mr Rochester's first wife, who she christens Antoinette Cosway. In Wide Sargasso Sea, Antoinette/Bertha can hardly be called a heroine. Instead she comes off as a spineless young woman who is only too eager to become a victim of her English husband. He in turn is convinced that he is actually the victim of their unfortunate marriage. With this, Rhys creates two exceptionally unsympathetic characters, who you wish would just get up and do something about their situations, instead of wallowing in self-pity and rum. I'm sure there was actually a strong woman behind the raving lunatic that Bertha Mason became, but Jean Rhys hasn't shown her."
3,This book added a new twist to Jane Eyre.,This book was a little hard to follow at first with several narrating changes but after a little while the book became quick to read and easier to understand. The book added a new twist to the classic Jane Eyre but did not give too much as to ruin the story of Jane Eyre. Not only does Rhys write a wonderful addition to Jane Eyre but she also teaches the reader a lot about the times and cultures in the early 1800's in Jamaica.
2,Who is narrating this thing? It's anyone's guess.,"This book is supposed to be told in three distinct voices: young Antoinetta, Rochester, and Crazy Antoinetta stuck in the attic. But the narration jumps about and it isn't told in three distinct voices: Antoinetta is in Rochester's section, and the voices are so similar that it is impossible to tell who is speaking. And it is very contrived because you know (or at least those of us who read ""Jane Eyre"") how it is going to end. It's much ado about something we already know about. I gave it two stars because Rhys can really capture a setting, and the scene that foreshadows the fire at the end of Jane Eyre was wonderfully written. It's an easy read, so if you loved Jane Eyre and want some more of it, go ahead and read it. Just don't expect to be as moved as you were by Bronte."
3,She was on fire when he lay down on her,"Well, it feels funny to give a modern classic a starred review, as academics have surely debated its merits more thoroughly than I can possibly do.I came away from this novel thinking that she was already insane when he married her. Some seem to think it's somehow Rochester's fault, but she was well along the path before he got there. He could have treated her a lot better and maybe mitigated the insanity better by not rejecting her so thoroughly. Maybe if he hadn't been a proud, stubborn, hot-headed fool, he would have treated her with kid gloves.But he's Rochester - totally the wrong person in the wrong place and **the wrong era** to get her the help she needed. For his time, he did a pretty good job of it, keeping her locked in the attic instead of in an asylum.It does give a lot more depth to his character - I'm going to have to re-read Jane Eyre!"
4,Wide Sargasso Sea,The book was in excellent shape and arrived in time for my college course. It was a good book to read and I finished reading it in a week!
3,Beach Book,"Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys is a pretty good novel. It was difficult to get into at first, but in the middle of the novel the story line begins to unfold. Throughout the novel the speaker changes and at times it was hard to determine who was speaking. I would recommend this book to those who have read Jane Eyre because those people would get more out of it and the connections between the two novels. This book would be a great beach book, since most of the novel is set in the Caribbean, true paradise."
3,"The Darker Side of ""Jane Eyre""","I loved the idea of this book -- especially being a ""Jane Eyre"" fan. It is a strange book though and not a happy one. I struggled with it throughout because it challenged my previous conceptions of Mr. Rochester. I admit though that ultimately it did not matter -- my curiosity got the better of me. Who has not wondered about the lunatic wife in ""Jane Eyre?!"" This book does a fair job at explaining the causes: an other worldly environment, an elusive husband -- both which contribute to Antoinette Cosway's/Berthe's (Mr. Rochester's wife) unraveling.If you have ever wondered why Mr. Rochester's wife ended up locked away in the attic, then this book is for you."
5,poet,"This is one of the most memorable plays I have read in my life. It has love, drama, incest and so on. It's so good that I hope to read it again and again."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"This is one of those rare stories that seeps into your soul and leaves a lasting impression. The language itself, while a bit difficult at first becomes a song you want to sing and long to hear it spoken. The story, sometimes achingly sad and violent is ultimately triumphantly romantic - with a sequence of events that leaves the reader breathless and yearning for more. Shortly after reading Precious Bane, I was lucky enough to discover a small theatre group in Chicago performing the stage version. My husband and I were in a packed theatre of about 30 people, where I sat front and center with the actors not more than two feet in front of me. Knowing the story line as I did, I made a spectacle of myself sobbing through the second half of the play. I'm sure the actors were gratified that they had such a strong effect on their audience. Suffice it to say, no one who picks up this book will be disappointed, nor will they ever forget it."
5,The Most Beautiful Book I Have Ever Read,"Mary Webb was a prolific yet unsung novelist of the late 19th and early 20th century. I have read everything she wrote that is currently available in print. Precious Bane was my introduction to Mary Webb, and still my favorite. Her painterly imagery brings the reader right up close in this story of a young woman marked by a ""hare-shotten lip,"" who defies the odds stacked against her to emerge into a gentle victory that will leave you in tears, if you are not made of stone."
4,Love it!,"I really enjoyed this story when the BBC production aired many years ago. The reason for the 4 start rating is the dialect used for much of the conversations can be challenging at times. Some words are so odd I had to take an educated guess about the meaning. However, other than that, it is an enjoyable book with an upbeat ending."
3,Precious Bane,"Wonderful story and author, however, the print was so small it was difficult to read. I ordered one for my Kindle and enjoyed it immensely."
4,Ripe for pastiche,"Precious Bane is perhaps the archetypal rural romance - a genre which was very popular in England in the 1920s, and the best of its class. To tired urban readers of the late 1990s it will seem cliched - almost itself a pastiche of the genre. To me it is required reading, if only as a pre-cursor to the best pastiche of the rural romance ever written - Stella Gibbon's Cold Comfort Farm. (Aside - Why don't publishers think creatively sometimes and bind the pastiche along with the books being mocked? Northanger Abbey with Anne Radcliffe for example). Read it and laugh or read it and weep, but read it."
3,Disappointing production,"Altho I love both Tony Bennett's artistry and Duke Ellington's music, I was disappointed by the way this CD was produced with excerpts of songs placed in annoying senseless intervals to preface other songs. Aside from this, the individual pieces were masterfully performed."
3,Bennett not in very good voice,"I was rather disappointed by this album because Bennett and Ellington should be such a very good combo. However, I think age is finally catching up with Bennett. He still sounds very good when he stays within a relatively limited range and when he's not singing too loudly, but when he attempts the high notes, he sounds strained and very harsh. I first noticed this on his ""Here's to The Ladies"" album a few years ago, but it's more pronounced here. He also has some intonation problems on ""Sophisticated Ladies"" which is admittedly very difficult to sing.Only an average effort by a great singer."
4,real hip hop ish.,"That's pretty shocking to see that KRS said something that critical about 9-11. That kind of sets me off, but hey, other messages he preaches are great. One, a lot of bad ish the government does. It's true, there hasn't been a good President in a LONG TIME, and I doubt there will be one any time soon. Another message is the anti commercialism. And all the dissing on Nelly, that needs to be out there more. Nelly is wack. KRS One can be drugged, have his tongue cut off, and still rhyme better than Nelly. And KRS does not have that damn annoying voice that Nelly pisses everyone off with. This isn't KRS's best, but it's damn good, especially over Nelly crap. If your into good disses on Nelly, purchase this. If you back Nelly, than you need to go to the Temple of Hip Hop Kulture and learn what real hip hop is all about."
3,"3 Stars- Worth it just to here ""Ova Here""","...The song is titled Ova Here and appears twice on The Mix Tape (the second time is a remix). This song is worth listening to the rest of the sub-par material on this CD just to here KRS-One show Nelly who rules the world of Hip-Hop. Saying stuff from ""..."" to ""..."" The Teacha rips into to Nelly with percision and quality. This is in my opinion a real come-back song, where KRS doesn't have to attack Nelly's sexuality like Nas did to Jay-Z.Any way, besides the two Ova Here's the rest of the album is not KRS-Standards. Things Is About To Change is a tight track and Down The Charts is a creative story about a rap star who slides down the charts. But all the Shout-Outs and weak tracks make this CD a 3 star effort. BUT GET IT JUST TO LISTEN TO OVA HERE is my final verdict."
2,"Not the Best of KRS-One...No, Not By A Longshot!","First off I really like KRS-One and I think he's one of the ace ministers of Hip-Hop: a culture that's going to hell in a handbasket depending on who talk to. But this particular cd was nothing more than a diss-Nelly session. I mean I don't particularly care for Nelly but I am not going to hate on him just because I don't happen to care for his lyrics or his style I don't personally know him.That's the problem. KRS-One on this particular cd spends too much of his time and talent crying and whinning about Nelly. If I was Nelly, I'd buy this cd just to have something to laugh at. I don't think the whole legion of Nelly fans will switch over or start listening to ""real Hip-Hop"" because of this cd. And KRS-One fans who have heard better from him will be shaking their heads in disappointment."
3,Toby Christmas 1,"Wasn't crazy about this CD. Don't get me wrong, it is technically very good and all the songs are old favorites. I just don't think Toby Keith has any business making this kind of CD. I have 15 CDs of his fantastic @#$%kicking music and that's the way I like him. The same thing goes for volumn 2. His voice is meant to raise hell, not the Savior."
5,GREAT CD,I'm a big Toby fan and was surprised to see him come out with a Christmas CD I was even a bit reluctant to purchase it but it is actually very good.... it is a great CD....My girl which is a semi-fan loves this CD....Go out and buy it
5,Entertains troops in person,"I think the CD was quite entertaining and my family loved it, that's all that counts in my book. I bought this CD because of Toby's work with the troops overseas, who are in harms way every day, and when Toby goes to any of the theatres of this terrible war he shares this danger with them. Thank you again Toby and Merry Christmas to you and yours."
5,Great New Sound To Old Songs,"Toby's versions of these classic songs are not incredibly original, but it's still great to hear a new voice behind these songs. This very easy-going Christmas CD is one of the best I've ever heard. If you like Toby and Christmas music, it doesn't get much better than this."
3,Bought as a gift,"My fiance really likes country music and loves Christmas music, so this was a pretty easy fix to get her. She plays it at least once a year around the holidays, and I even listen to it from time to time."
3,BOOOO on splitting this cd up!,this used to be a 2 cd set for around $18.. now they split up the 2 discs and charge $14 each? it's a good album but this is ridiculous.. i know he has good marketing because i always get emails trying to sell me something on his site.
4,"""Rumbles"" ahead","What a joy to watch a first rate series! John has thawed out a bit and seems a tad warmer and more accessable than his some of his other series characterizations although he never strays from being top notch. He is throughly believable as the the middle aged barrister with the wife turned career woman and almost adult children giving him pause to reflect and get one's house in order. The casting works to create a wonderful mix of family, co-workers, rivals and villans.The story lines are tight, thought provoking and deserve a thumbs up for the twists, turns, and ""rumbles"" that they take. Always enjoyable to see a craft well done."
4,WOW!,"What a surprise! This album was in the listening station at Borders and I thought I'd give it a try. After hearing the first track [title track], I grabbed it without a care for what the rest of it was like. The first track has a vintage flair to it, but includes all the contemporary jazz sounds necessary to give it a clean sound. Most of the other tracks sound contemporary, so I gave it four stars because the label said that the whole album had that '60s' sound to it, but it was really only the first track. However, Brian really shreds on about 7 of the 10 tracks, and has a soothing mellow sound on the other 3. If you're thinking about picking up a great guitar-oriented jazz CD, start with this one. It will make you really respect jazz guitarists. Thumbs up to Brian!"
3,Smooth Guitar Jazz-Pop,"Don't be fooled by the ultra cool jacket, there is nothing particularly sixties about this CD. Drawing from such influences as George Benson, Pat Metheny and Wes Montgomery, Hughes essentially retreads some of the finer moments of these artists, albeit with considerable skill. A nice listen for the very reasons you might have enjoyed the works of his afore mentioned mentors."
3,Voila! It's a decorative table.,"This table come unassembled which is to be expected. It arrived from Lumisource very quickly. The rub? No directions to put it together - no contact information - nothing! How hard could it be, right? Well, there is the table top (glass), the blue plastic cone, two bottom pieces - one heavy and one (shiny silver) that is cosmetic, and the cord/light fixture. So there were a number of screws and washers and I just set to assembling it in a logical fashion. I had to reassemble it after seeing that the light (40 watts) was too bright and then again when I realized the bolt was sticking out from the bottom so the table was not sitting flat. For the light I went with a very low watt florescent bulb - equivalent to 25 watts incandescent. The table has to be disassembled to change the bulb which is another reason to use a long-lasting florescent bulb.It's cute and has a foot operated light switch so all's well that ends well."
5,Fascinating look at metaphysics of major IR theories,"The other reviewers may be approaching this book from an undergraduate perspective, which is entirely legitimate. I can remember well my own frustrations with the manner in which IR theorists seemed to simply ignore the facts of the real world. But as my studies progressed, I came to understand that theory is always present. It always mediates between the facts we see and the interpretations we put on them. This is why Cynthia Weber's book is so important. Thru her analysis of a series of films she demonstrates how each main IR theory is beholden to a certain metaphysics about the actors of world politics, and relations the define them. Its a very novel idea, and she writes in a very accessible manner. I will definitely be using this book in my IR classes from here on in."
2,BASK Album falls short,"The album musically is a great effort from the band members. The album falls short however, in production quality. The album was recorded partly in a studio environment and partly in a live setting. This is highly noticeable as one track sounds very well produced and then the next track will have a very ""live"" sound with poor production and no mastering. The songwriting is very unique and really pulls all of the different flavors of swing into one album effort. The bottom line: if you can look beyond the terrible production quality and focus on the songs themselves, you will probably be able to enjoy this album."
3,Teaching methods were interesting,"I ordered this DVD for my granddaughter who is 4 years old. She really enjoyed it. Her brother who has been evaluated as autistic watched some of it. It was not what I expected. It is not the type of video that is fun to watch over and over. At four years old, this is how you know the video is enjoyed by smaller children sometimes. I thought the teacher was very good and sincere. She even addressed autistic children. My granddaughter is not autistic. For the price that I paid, I would not recommend it to a friend unless the friend's child was serious about dancing. Although, the teacher in the film said you can never tell who will become a serious dancer. I enjoyed watching the film with my granddaughter."
3,Great patterns.,The book was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. The patterns are great looking but some of the threads used to make the outfits in the book have been discontinued and I haven't found substitutes.
2,Too hard to find the yarn required,I love the pictures. My little girls look at it all the time. But it is very hard to find the suggested yarn. The clothes are very cute but I wouldn't buy it again. I am not good at finding substitute yarns nor do I have the patience for it. Her knitting Barbie book is the same.
3,Most yarns not readily available,"I have made a couple of small items from this book. so far Ifind the instructions a bit confusing. They are not writtenin the form I am used to. It takes me a couple of tries tofigure some of them out. Plus, Most of the yarns used are Foreign names that I have never heard of and are not readily available. she doesn't give any alternative yarn to use in their place. However, The companies are listed in the back of the book,if you want to order the yarn.There are a few items that use #10 or #5 thread which are readily available at craft stores.I find the instructions a bit hard to follow also because theyall run together instead of writing the different rows seperately, the instructions run on and on. It's hard to keepyour place."
4,wish I had this years ago,"If you have people in your life (such as sisters, daughters, neices, granddaughters) that play with Barbie and you know how to crochet, you will find this book very helpful. I found some of the instructions a bit difficult, but most are fine. And you can always use this book as inspiration to make up your own clothes for Barbie. After all, Barbie doesn't always have to go with the crowd, does she? She sets her own fashion.I would have given this book a higher rating but the pattern difficulties interfere with that. However, I do recommend this book."
2,Very Difficult,"The styles are wonderful, but they call for very difficult to find yarns. I have crocheted for 40 years, and I have a very hard time matching the gauge and some of the patterns are hard for me to understand."
4,Doll crazy,A great book (I also have the Knit for Barbie) but a little difficult to follow...but I will continue working on some of the items.
1,"Ordered it and says it arrived, but where is it? My address is very a popular address? I cannot get any help? I cannot believe t","Ordered it and says it arrived, but where is it? My address is very a popular address? I cannot get any help? I cannot believe the entire order did not make it?"
2,Don't listen to this audio book,I find George Guidall's voice to be soothing and exactly right for the Cat Who series. Dick Van Patten's rendition of this book was painful.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This series was one I wanted to like, but that proved impossible. Silly, trite, overworked! At best, they should be in the juvenile offerings.....but I'm sure any child other than a youngster would be bored. Save your money for some better written, more interesting stories...go buy a comic book instead, and get a quicker, more intelligent read. For the cat lovers (myself included), this proved to be no more likable-their input is truly stupid and minimal. My cats would be insulted to be included in a story like this, or put in a class with these feline ""sleuths.""......I also listened to the audio book, and couldn't wait for it to end...I don't like Van Patten either."
2,A Disappointment,"As a long-time mystery fan and a cat lover, I thought that a popular book combining the two was a good bet. However, I found the story uninteresting and the cat's contribution to solving the mystery more supernatural then feline. The only redeeming aspect of the book was the setting (Breakfast Island is clearly based on Mackinac Island, MI, which I had visited a few years before reading the book). This was my first book from ""The Cat Who ..."" series, and my last."
4,Wonderful installment in a great series.,"This a yet another delightful look in the strange and wonderful world inhabited by Qwill, the cats and other residents of Moose County. I missed the interplay between Qwill and some of the characters who did not travel to Breakfast Island with him, which is why I didn't rate the book higher.Is this series great literature? No. Is it fun and consistently entertaining? Definitely!"
4,The Cat Who Should Not Have Left Moose County,"An avid fan of the Cat Who series I found this installation boring! The cats, Koko and Yum Yum, and their human, Qwilleran, are always entertaining but this time the storyline was lacking. Maybe the absence of Moose County residents is the reason. We've come to know these folks and they were missing from this adventure. The story takes place on Breakfast Island, the newest 'in' spot. There, Qwill meets and makes new friends but the story just doesn't click. I was much happier to discover our trio of detectives stays home for their next adventure. Meow"
4,One of the Best in the Series,"Before purchasing this book, I read the other reviews, some of which were less than flattering. I almost didn't buy it based on those reviews. Contrary to other written comments, I felt this edition is one of the best in the series. The plot was intriguing and the mystery a well-kept secret which unfolds at the end. But you don't have to take my word for it--read it for yourself."
3,Not for young children,"After my son's preschool teacher said he like Spanish better than all the other activities, I wanted to help him continue to learn. I got this book/cd and Beth Manner's 2 cd's Fun Spanish for Kids and Magic Spanish for kids. I agree with the June, 1999 reader. This cd would be good for children or adults who already know spanish or who can read really well. There is no english translation on the cd. Only in the book. If you are looking for a fun cd to play in the car or during play time get Beth Manner's Cd's."
5,Easy to sing along!,"I just love the CD to sing along with my baby. The quality of the CD is very good, the words are clearly spoken and repeated, and the melodies are fun and playful. I also liked having the book to follow along and make sure I have understood the words. I highly recommend this book/CD for those who want to make it fun for their baby to begin to learn the melody and words of a new language."
2,Definately too basic,"I agree with the post by the Latin American mom. I am a native English speaker, but even I can recognize that these songs are really dumb! Plus, the quatlity of the CD recording is terrible. If you are a Spanish teacher who is really at a loss for material you may be able to use a few of the songs, but I'm positive there's better out there. I am a Spanish minor and a Spanish-teacher-to-be, and I'm trying to find songs to use in the classroom. I would really prefer real spanish nursery rhymes. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this."
1,CD sung by non-native speakers.,"Call me a purist but if you're going to learn to speak a language it should be from a native speaker. Although, the songs are cute they are sung by children with an english accent. I want my child to hear a native speaker."
2,Useful But Obsessive Info,"Throughout this book the author attempts to prove that all popular forms of entertainment have roots in misogyny. His reliance on examples nobody remembers is interesting, given his insistence on their powerful cultural influence to this day. Though it is useful in tracing the roots of misogynistic icons, the book strains at the bit to find a conspiracy of male poets, writers, artists, and scientists who were all out for one thing: to put women in their ""proper"" inferior place in the game of natural selection and pave the way for Nazism. He puts words in his sources' mouths repeatedly and engages in sometimes ludicrous speculation, making one wonder where the good professors own deepest beliefs lie. Very ""politically- correct,"" but still a useful analysis, like his previous(better) work, IDOLS OF PERVERSITY."
3,Great for Beach Wedding!,"I used these as a base for my escort cards for my wedding reception. You can't count on every single umbrella to be perfectly straight when they're lifted, so I would order extra to compensate for that, but that's just because they're a cheap drink garnish. Filter out a few bad ones and you have an adorable decoration for a beach/outdoor summer themed wedding or party!"
1,never received products or any response from seller,still waiting to figure out why we are being told these have been deliveredWhen we DON'T have them..... ?? We have a post office box... have never been given this item...maybe our postmaster snagged them for a party??? WHERE could they be?Wish the seller would answer our emails and figure out WHERE our box is...we need some partay umbrellies!
2,"Cute, but not what I ordered",I thought I was going to get the umbrellas in the picture but I didn't. I expected a single color umbrella with white flower detail. Instead I got colorful umbrellas with a bold colored very large flower on top. I also expected 4 different color options in the box. Instead I got 2 color options in the box. I thought I was going to get these lighter colored umbrellas almost close to pastel and instead I got really bold almost primary colored ones. They didn't ruin what I was making with them but they didn't go as well as the ones I ordered would have.These are cute... just not what I ordered.
3,definitely set the atmosphere,"i got these to decorate some desserts i had made for a luau-themed picnic and they were quite cute. there were some umbrellas that were broken right out of the box and some umbrellas couldn't stay open wide, so if you need 144 umbrellas, you might want to get extras because there are bound to be some that you can't use, unless you don't mind having umbrellas with holes in them. overall it was an ok purchase. the quality was in line with the price. you might want to check the dollar store just in case they've got them cheaper. i got lazy and just ordered them here w/o checking."
3,Eh...,"I can't imagine what the factory conditions are like for places that make these umbrellas...I often feel crappy about buying products like this because of how crappy the jobs must be. That being said, these umbrellas seemed even cheaper and crappier than I expected. They're fine for kitsch appeal, but not for much else."
1,Save your money! Don't buy this book!,"Hi there, folks. I've read literally hundreds of erotic books in my time. So I know a good one. ""Lay of the Land"" has to rank among the worst I've ever read. The writing isn't that bad for ""Victorian style,"" but very little actually ""happens."" Lots of expectation with almost no payoff. Don't waste your time. Go read something by Richard Manton or Marcus Van Heller instead."
3,K&N Air Filter,Bought for Christmas and just recently installed. Too new to rate at this time. Expecting good things from the product based on other reviews.
1,No improvement in performance nor MPG,"This filter now sits on the shelf in my shop. I have a 2001 Tacoma Prerunner. This filter did nothing for performance nor MPG. May work okay for others, total waste of money for me."
5,"Ah, the joys of Wallace Stevens...","I have had a love affair with Wallace Stevens' work and ""The Palm at the End of the Mind"" for almost three decades. My favorite Wallace Stevens' poem is ""The Man With the Blue Guitar."" This poem is fabulous spoken aloud - I loved it so much that I memorized it! ""The Men That Are Falling"" is rather like the hour between 3AM-4AM, very contemplative - when it seems like you can feel eternity. I hope that you enjoy this book as much as I have."
3,The begining is rough. Greatness awaits in the future.,"I wish that I could give this book more than three stars, but I found most of the stories to be quite dull. In fact I skimmed over the majority of the book without really reading it.That being said I know for a fact that greatness is around the corner. I used to read ""Spirit"" stories when they were published by Kitchen Sink Press in the early 80's. At the time the stories that they reprinted were after Will Eisner had perfected his Spirit creation. Not his early material.I have no regrets for buying this book. I kind of expected the begining to be a little rough and ragged. I bought the book because I wanted to see the true beginings of the Spirit - warts and all. In the next few volumes I expect to see what I remember reading years ago. Wonderful, entertaining stories where a master has found his stride and produces fabulous comic material."
3,"Good stories, but problem with format","Others have talked about Eisner's remarkable talent, even in this early volume. The paper is nice, the three articles in the beginning (one by Eisner, one by Alan Moore, one by someone else whose name I don't remember) are nice. But there's a problem: Since the strips are seven pages long, every other story starts on the left page. But they originally were on the right! Eisner had a great eye for layouts, and this includes facing pages. This effect is killed in every other story. I hope this oversight is corrected future editions, especially the later, more visually impressive strips."
4,Something good that will become something great,"I had not read much of the earlier Spirit stuff until I got this book. I'm giving this four stars based on what the Spirit became after a couple of years. The stories in this book run from serviceable to quite good, and Eisner's art grows by leaps and bounds over the six months of comics presented here. By the end of the book you can see that Eisner has figured out the formula for the Spirit quite well. The layouts start to resemble what we think of as an ""Eisner splash page"" and everything really congeals after a couple of months' worth of stories. My only wish is that they could have reprinted the other stories as well. Maybe once DC gets done reprinting all the essentials from the Golden Age, they'll focus on the things that everyone has forgotten about."
2,Not The Best Place To Start,"The Spirit Archives Vol. 1 isn't bad... when compared to other Archive volumes from the era, it actually quite good. It's just that it's not particularly good for The Spirit. The story-telling is certainly competent enough, but the strip really hasn't found its voice. Still, it's good fun watching the various pieces of the strip fall into place: the supporting characters, the splash pages, Eisner's developing technique, etc.If you're looking to sample The Spirit to see what all the fuss is about, you might want to skip this one. The book's charms are much more evident in Vol. 2-4... and Eisner really wouldn't hit his stride until he returned to the book with Vol. 12."
5,A warm cup of slash,What is with the harsh reviews for this film? I do not get it. This movie is one of my personal faves. Why you ask? Well it is so comforting I know its a slasher but on a rainy day this movie is perfect. It takes no brains and the movie is never boring. The acting is a mixed bag but the main characters do a very good job. The best thing about this film is how good of a job they do of hiding the killer. Bravo filmakers. Overall a fun ride.
3,2.5-3 stars,"This movie was a bit low budget, but it doesn't do too bad overall. The actors, for the most part, stink. The twist is pretty neat and there are some really cool and different style kills. There's certainly an element of gore and the movie kept my attention for the most part. I guess if you could find this DVD for 5.00 or under it'd be a justified slasher movie to own."
2,An average horror movie,"This movie is for the ones who like ""any"" kind of horror movies. I could not find anything special in it except for visual effects in some scenes. I call it an average horror movie as it does not have a value added but just makes you spend some spare time. There is too much blood in the flick and some instant moves make it rated R for viewers below 18 (and persons with heart problems)"
4,An amazing Stanley Kubrick-eusqe thriller,"This movie was an amazing journey that really shows how well it was made. I really loved the acting and the plot. Taking place in Budapest, a young American becomes intrigued by the dark psyche that stalks the atmosphere which he eventually becomes obseessed with, and in that finds a diturbed young woman who becomes a dark part of his everlasting nightmare he lives in."
5,WOW,"I'm a huge fan of Eric Shaeffer's work, but I did not know this film exsisted till an airing on the sundance channel a few months ago and I have to say this is the most true to form film about love and loss that I have seen to date. Anyone looking for a film that challenges their perceptions of what love can be, what it really is, or what hope does to the restless...this is the film for you..."
1,Waste of time and talent,"I rented this movie because it had Jurgen Prochnow in it, but they wasted a fine actor. The whole movie is a waste. This is a low budget, poorly written and acted supposed thriller. There aren't too many thrills, but a lot of bad dialog, contrived situations and a lead character that does one stupid, implausible thing after another."
5,Advanced means advanced!,"I used this book for my Junior and Senior year in high school. Even though I spread it out over two years (something they recommend you do, depending on your circumstances), I didn't find it slow at all. It teaches many challenging math concepts that are quite advanced (hence the name). I took a pre-calculus course from a community college my senior year, and at least 90% of the material in the college course had already been covered in the Advanced Math book.On a side note, a lot of the word problems in this book are quite amusing."
5,Excellent help for homeschooling,This is a great help for homeschooling since we have to figure most things out by ourselves. The textbook only provides answers to the odd-numbered questions but not the actual solutions. This book shows the steps to the solutions and includes both odd and even problems. This is a useful companion to an excellent math book.
5,The Best Math Program,"Saxon math is the best math program I have seen! The way they explain concepts is very clear and understandable. Sometimes it is tough to do all the review questions, especially if a particular type of problem is difficult. But if you don't practice it, you won't remember it! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quality math program. It is especially good for homeschool students who want to major in a math-related degree in college. If anyone is looking for more resources on homeschooling and math I would suggest visiting...for some good information. I also recommend finding a good math tutor who can help you with difficult problems."
5,Helpful Step by Step Guide,"The book is a great guide, especially if you aren't entirely sure what you did wrong or what the next step is in a particular problem. I highly recommend it."
2,difficult to follow.,"difficult to fillow. scattered, not enough guidance throughout the book. why are you asking for more thn 16 words.hope this provides you the 16 words."
2,"okay, but less than expected","The Advanced Math book did arrive, but its condition was much more delapidated than expected, cover was quite marred and corners very worn, many pages inside were written on, and an unremoveable sticker was on the front. Yes, it does have the problems and we are using the book, but it clearly is in worse shape than any of our books which we have used for five years."
4,A great Hardcore album,"I'll admit that not everyone is a fan of Hardcore electronic music and dance and all that, but if you are this is definitely a great album to own. There is a total of about 3 hours and 45 minutes worth of music in this collection. There are some frequently heard songs in here and overall I'd say the mixes are worth listening to, That's for sure."
2,Ledgend & Legacy,"This CD contains various artists singing along with Ernest Tubb. I was not aware of that when I purchased it. It is an alright CD, but I would have preferred just Ernest."
5,WHAT DO I SEE THAT YOU DON`T?,"I just can't understand the bad reviews I see here. It's either love-it-or-hate-it. For me, it's perfectly clear: 5 STARS. They have not lost it or anything. They only get better. That's my opinion. Some say it's best described as 'Automatic meets Up'. I do agree, although I find this album much better than 'Up'. I liked 'Up' very much but it missed something. 'Reveal' may not be full of hits but it's not all about that, is it? It's just plain simple good music. Buying this album is no risk if you generally like R.E.M.Standout tracks: Disappear, The Lifting, Imitation of Life."

5,Easy Listening - Can't quit listening,"What a great CD! I have been listening to Reveal in my car on long trips, and I really have enjoyed every song (you know, usually, you skip a few every time, so that you can listen to your favorites...). Stipe is so mellow, mature, and pensive on this album, but also rather upbeat and optimistic. It gives me the impression that he is going through some self-reflection about the ""big picture"" right now. The melodies are haunting and catchy, the arrangements are like little personalities for each song (each one has it's own), and I can actually understand most of the words (a minus for more traditional Stipe fans). I love this CD, and I highly recommend it!"
3,Typical R.E.M CD.,They all sound kind of the same but the good thing is that it gave R.E.M a boost because their last album was such a bomb they needed to have Imitaion of Life become a hit. This CD is worth buying if you are a true fan of R.E.M. It is an O.K CD sinse it sounds the same. I would rather have Blink 182 because it has more attitude to the songs and the rock is a little harder than this.
1,It's REM,I never have liked REM and I guess this CD seals the deal. Unimportant songs from an overly pretentious band that continues to shove their political views down our gullets. Why do rock stars believe they are social/political experts? The world may never know.
3,a very serviceable release...,"when i read the reviews of this album, it seems that everyone harkens back to the ""glory days"" of Automatic for the People, and declares himselve or herself a longtime fan. well, the first e.p. came out in 1980, and the band released a slew of great albums in that decade. nothing they have done in the 90's comes close to such great albums as Reconstruction of the Fables or Document. and Reveal is no exception. yes, there are some good mid tempo songs, but, as has been the case with the last several albums, i feel disappointed and unfulilled. the album doesn't feel cohesive, unless sameness = cohesion. i rue the day Man in the Moon was released as a single, as it no seems to be the model for the future.don't get me wrong. i am a huge rem fan, and i appreciate the fact that they continue to move forward. i will continue to buy all of their releases. let's just hope next time they make it a little more interesting, and stop trying to recreate their ""successes"" of the 90's."
1,"God, please retire!","REM has been putting the same god awful album out since ""Out of Time."" Songs with no memorable hooks and Stipes bellow bark voice trying to stay as cryptic lyrically as his twenty something alter ego. A once ground breaking then arena rocking band drizzling away into unimportance."
2,The Fire Is Gone,"My two faves from the 80's, still going: REM and Echo & the Bunnymen. REM has drifted into sythesizers and a drum machine (ironically there is a song on _Reveal_ called ""Beat A Drum""-- pretty song, but fellas, could you beat a drum for me?). EATB started with a drum machine, replaced it with real drummers, and are still rocking. EATB's _Flowers_, also just released, is vastly more satisfying than _Reveal_; I still get to enjoy Will Sergeant's guitar work. Where is Peter Buck, and what is he doing? Mellowing out at a Mellotron, I suppose, and making the occasional cameo appearance on an REM album. It _is_ better than Up, though. Maybe Michael Stipe should try an Ian McCulloch hairstyle..."
4,Up 2,"Extrapolating on some of the same sounds REM experimented with on ""Up"", ""Reveal"" offers up some new gems like ""The Lifting"", ""I've Been High"", ""All The Way To Reno"", ""Imitation Of Life"", ""Summer Turns To High"" and ""I'll Take The Rain"". However, I think I liked ""Up"" better. There are quite a few forgettable slow tracks on this disc and it's certainly not up to par with ""Murmur"" or ""Automatic For The People"". REM show that they are still willing to move in a musical direction that is their own, as they always have, this time out displaying psychedelic, folk and country influences in their music. What I found most revealing about ""Reveal"" is that Stipe finally decided to print all the lyrics to his songs in the sleeve! I don't think REM fan's will be disappointed with ""Reveal"", but I don't think it's their best work either."
2,Not up to par,"Being a long time REM fan, this CD/DVD-Audio is somewhat dissapointing. It is a very flat sounding album with little dynamics. That was my first impression anyway.The surround mix is also lacking. Very little center channel and surround channel use with next to nothing in the bass channel. If you really like the vintage REM, you may be dissapointed with this."
2,A Totally Different REM These Days,"The consensus seems to be that some people prefer the electronic trio of REM over the former college rock 4 piece known as REM, and fair enough. The same people are writing gushing reviews of Kid A and Amnesiac, but i have to say that at the end of the day i prefer some human warmth and conversation, the style that made REM who they were to begin with, than ultra-produced tuneless tracks about the weather. It's crazy to think that it cost many thousands to make something so ultimately (and it seems, deliberately) disposable when Adventures in Hi-Fi could be recorded during a soundcheck.There are some good tracks but nothing that would ever make a Best of REM CD."
2,"By Far, One of the Worst Albums I've Ever Heard.","I've been an REM fan since 1986 and, in my opinion, they haven't released a good or even decent album since New Adventures in Hi-Fi. This album is lifeless and dull. The only thing it might be good for is putting oneself to sleep."
2,Nothing revealed....,"REM...one of the greatest bands to grace this planet. A band that has had huge influence on a number of bands. Unfortunately, this album is nothing but lackluster music. There is no real drive or energy to these songs. I was completely shocked at just how bad this CD was (ok, not BAD, just not nearly as good as any of their other albums). Maybe REM needs to hang it up before they burn out...because this isn't music that entertains the mind or makes one feel good. REM needs to bow out and let their legacy stay intact just as The Replacements, The Police, The Pixies, Pavement, etc. did. This album is for die hard fans only."
5,They are still high,"This album confirms that REM is one of the 2 or 3 best bands in the world today. ""Reveal"" is a great album, maybe as good as ""Up"", which I loved. It may not be ""Automatic for the people"", but it's still REM at its best.At first listen, ""Reveal"" looks just like a collection of good but not special songs, all sounding alike, and one fears that REM's most creative moments maybe be gone. But with each listen, one starts to really appreciate it and find the magic of some wonderful songs. My favorites: ""I've been high"" (a masterpiece, an instant classic), ""Beat a drum"", ""The lifting"", ""All the way to Reno""For the REM fans who still don't like it: give this album another listen. Thanks God bands like REM are still around."
5,TOTALLY WORTH THE 13 BUCKS,"WILL MAKE IT SHORT AND SWEET. BEEN FAN SINCE EARLY 80'S THEY'VE GOT A SOUND AND IT IS BACK IN FINE FORM HERE. NO POINT COMPARE IT TO AUTOMATIC OR MURMUR OR GREEN ETC. IT STANDS ON IT'S OWN. UPBEAT AND SERENE. STIPE SOUNDS GREAT. ALL GOOD, REALLY NICE TRACKS FOR SURE BUT 'I'VE BEEN HIGH', LISTENED WITH HEADPHONES WILL PUT YOU RIGHT, AFTER LONG TOUGH DAY. I'M ENJOING THIS ONE. NOW FOR MY LAST MY 2 CENTS, LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT STILL THEIR BEST."
3,More like two and a half,"I've had Reveal for more than a year now, and still I just can't get into it. A couple of songs hit home, like Imitation of Life, The Lifting and All the Way to Reno. AS far as the rest, well they either seem fussy and/or forced. I had this sitting on the shelf for several months and thought that the passing of time may shed some new light, but I was dissapointed. While UP was not exactly one of their best, it did show some promise of moving in a new direction. Here that promise hits a wall. I have been a fan of REM since Chronic Town and have been glad that they do not just put the same album out over and over. I would not want them to keep releasing Murmur or Document over and over. Bands need to try new directions to stay fresh. I won't throw in the towel on REM, but I will do more homework before buying their next one."
3,This CD just doesn't stick with you,"I've been an REM fan since '83, and have enjoyed all the albums from Murmer - Monster (yes, I even liked that one). REM's greatest strength has always been the fact that they could change their sound from CD to CD, but still sound like no one else. Not to mention the fact that the first 9 or so discs are packed with great material.As for the recent stuff, New Adventures in Hi-Fi just didn't do it for me at all. Up and Reveal I tried to convince myself that I liked, and played them over and over again, but they just didn't stick with me. Reveal is too polished, with a sameness that clings to each track. I don't think REM is finished as a viable band and I think they may surprise us all with another powerful album. This just isn't it and I would recommend it only to REM completists."
3,What the heck happened?,"This albulm deserves only 2 stars but, I have enjoyed some of their previous albums so much, they get a charity star. REM used to provide a sharp edge to pop. Now, I'm not sure what their doing with this overproduced whale. I listened to it for the second time today on my way into work (I always give REM CD's a second listen before making a judgement), and I feel like I was stuck between floors in an elevator for 45 minutes listening to Muzak! I tried to listen to the music, but it was not compelling. I used to buy REM's music sight-unseen and would happily anticipate the release of a new album. Now, they've officially fallen off my radar and I won't trouble my changer with loading the cd into the player."
4,Moody and Intriguing,"Anyone who enjoys radio-friendly rock will enjoy the hit of this album, ""Imitation of Life."" Aside from it, much of this album is an exploration of a similar mood. ""Reveal"" is definitely a summer album, with a distinct Beach Boys feel. It's actually quite refreshing after listening to the miles of morose radio-rock that permeate the airwaves. Still, it's not for everyone, especially fans of REM's previous work. REM, in this album, does an excellent job of providing a cohesive unit.It's been said that the songs are not distinctive, and this is true to an extent, making it hard to pick great tracks. In a pinch, I would say ""Reno,"" ""Imitation of Life,"" ""Disappear,"" and ""Summer Turns to High"" as the highlights.The only trouble with the album, in my opinion, is the fact that the mood is very mellow: almost too mellow. Aside from ""Imitation.."" there is very little excitement. Thus, I'd say it's best as a lazy-summer-day album, and a good one at that."
1,Reveal: REM's Worst Release Yet,"It is evident that Bill Berry's influence on the band was greater than we had realized. After losing him a few years back, ""Up"" was a feeble attempt at life without Bill. ""Reveal"" is even worse. Gone are the rock songs, guitars and upbeat melodies. ""Reveal"" is elevator music at its worst. I am a long time fan, have been to their video shoots, many a concert and have even met the band personally countless times, but guys, hang it up already. I doubt I will ever listen to ""Reveal"" again. Well, maybe if I need to listen to something to put me to sleep....."
3,3 of 5,"As far as choruses and beats go, REM's Reveal is a step down from Up. That's despite the titles of the first two songs, which, metaphorically speaking, seem to imply further artistic elevation. High, with a dreamy snare and hazy chords, conjures 1980s Phil Collins. That's a good thing. But The Lifting, even with a rhythm section pleasantly reminiscent of Can You Feel It by The Jacksons, never really gets off the sandy ground.There's a Beautiful beach-boy ballad on the last album, but this entire Reveal has a warm summer atmosphere going for it. There's a Beachball flying thru the sky and the shiniest gem; Beat A Drum; has the blinding sun reflecting in the back of Michael Stipe's eye. Cool in contrast are the spacey sound effects on the group's Saturn Return, which throws what sounds like a referee's whistle into the mix, and the album's Rain song.marcellee.com"
2,REM disappoints,"I'm a long time REM fan and bought the album with much antisipaction. Unfortunatly, I couldn't even get through the first listen. A very slow, boring effort from a first class band."
1,"the worst of a long, bad run","Some bands get to the point in their career where no matter what they do, they're showered with acolades. REM is one of those bands. They could fart in a pickle jar and people would applaud, which is essentially what they did with ""Reveal"".""Reveal"" dissapoints because it comes on the heels of ""Up"" which, though not great, was a step in the right direction. ""Reveal"" isthe worst thing they've done since ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi""Please... REM is (or was) a good band. All of you who keep saying this kind of work is great, please stop. You're only egging them on."
4,Beautiful album,"I must confess that I really bought this album after seeing the band's performance in the Celebrate South Africa Concert in London, and for the first single. But the rest of the album is really deep and hypnotizing, you should listen to it not only with the ears but with the heart as well. Great and mellow songs like ""The Lifting"", ""I've been high"" and ""Beat a drum"" show us how the band needs to evolve and REM is doing it in a beautiful way. These tunes are the essence of the record and although they don't have the same classic sound of their big hits, they're great. Buy this"
2,Distortion?,Has anyone noticed the horrible distortion at the beginning of Chorus and the Ring? Did REM forget to edit this? Is this an instrument? This ruins one of the most listenable songs on this album. It sounds like my speakers are falling apart (they are not).
2,"in three words ""A bad CD""",Only one track is worth listening to! All the others are very low quality. Don't do my mistake. Don't buy this CD!
2,What's the fuss?,"I have NEVER understood the mass appeal of these guys.Michael Stipe's twee and cloying stage presence, plus mushmouthed, inarticulate delivery of pretentious, thick lyrics,and his bloated sense of self importance and apparent lack of humor are a turn off.The band can at least play, in a a rudimentary way.I find their hooks few and far between.""Driver 8"" was good, but it sounded like a Byrds song. (And released back in the mid 80's!)Sure, they've sold a lot of records.But then again, millions of people eat at McDonald's daily.That doesn't make it GREAT."
2,Disappointment,"I've given the disc two spins. I'm a longtime R.E.M. fan, dating back to '83. I've enjoyed their varying stylistic incarnations over the years and have been amazed at their ability to spin unforgettable melodies and complex lyrics. The new album is simply dull. The first two songs have promise, but when you hear ""All the way to Reno"" there's a foreboding sense in the air. ""She Just Wants To Be"" might be there best song in years but it's a bit muddled in the production. I've heard a live version of this song from the Rock In Rio concert and it towers above the album version. After ""She Just Wants.."" though, we're lost in a swirl of cluttered keyboard songs and some of the most banal lyrics Stipe's yet written. I liked ""Up"" and thought it was an uneven album, but there were some gorgeous songs on there that grabbed from moment go. R.E.M. continues to push their musical ideas but this time the songwriting really doesn't support them. A disappointment."
4,A New Band Revealed?,"""Reveal"" represents R.E.M.'s second effort without Bill Berry. I think it is a more unified, confident collection than its predecessor ""Up"" was; also it's a more upbeat album though just as introspective in my opinion.""The Lifting"", ""I've Been High"", ""All the Way to Reno"", and ""She Just Wants to Be"" open the album in a strong, fun-to-listen-to fashion. ""Imitation of Life"" is another enjoyable song.Though there are some harsh reviews of this album on here, it's the most enjoyable of R.E.M.'s last three original releases. (Professional music critics showered it with kudos so don't feel you have to take my word for it.) I think it may represent the band's new direction. But then again who knows -- R.E.M. loves to tinker with it sound and its next album may be quite a departure from ""Reveal."" I hope it's not too much of one, though."
3,Interesting but a little too quiet for me,"My first take on the latest REM CD was somewhat negative. Its very quiet and slow, not unlike there last effort. I've given it many plays since I bought it and could generally recommend it for serious REM fans. They are clearly not concerned about making pop radio hits, and never really were, but for fair-weather fans, this album would probably not be a good choice."
4,another winner,"REM are my favorite musical artists and I have been a fan since the mid 1980's. Therefore I don't think they could produce a record that I would give less than four stars. That said, this album is very good; enjoyable to listen to though, like UP, it cannot be fully judged on the first listen. In fact, on first listen I was a little disappointed, but the songs are subtle and definitely ""grow"" on you (with the exception of ""imitation of life"" which could easily be a pop radio hit). In my opinion, UP was one of the band's career highs, and I don't think REVEAL is as interesting or creative as an album, but there are some great melodies and lyrics in these songs that will keep it on my cd rotation for quite some time. If you are already a fan, you won't be disappointed; for those who aren't I don't think this record has much in it that will convert new listeners."
4,"Excellent CD, this music is art","When I first bought Reveal, I didn't really like it, and so let it sit unplayed for a long, long time. Then one time, I found that I was beginning to grow tired of the hard-rock music that I listen to so much, and I tried to think of the CD that I hadn't listened to in the longest while. Reveal immediately came to mind. So I popped it in my player, and discovered that I, all of a sudden, immensely enjoyed the beautiful sounds that were coming out of my speakers. All I did for the next few days was play the album over and over, and then show my friends (who never really have liked REM) what a band like REM was capable of. It then turned out that one of my friends had discovered ""Losing my Religion"" and instantly liked REM, and the other friend I showed it to remains a skeptic about REM, but loved the sounds of ""All the Way to Reno"". I think they were probably put off of REM by Stand........."
3,They've been better,"A bit disappointing, this one. I like REM and I like Michael Stipe's voice but this one doesn't have real moments for wich you buy a CD. The singles Imitation of live and All the way to Reno are good, but not outstanding. What you get to hear is maintaining REM-sound, very well suited as background-music when you invite some friends for dinner. But don't expect more than that. It's not ugly, it's not super but the real REM-fans may like it."
2,"Disappointing, except for ""Imitation of Life""!","I heard ""Imitation of Life"" playing in the record store, loved it, and bought this cd immediately, but except for that one terrific song, I'm very disappointed. The first 6 songs are slow, dull and sleepy and never get off the ground, and Stipe's singing is VERY flat and off-key in places, especially where he's reaching for high notes that are out of his range. There are a couple of other good (though slow-tempo) songs besides ""Imitation,"" but if you like their earlier, uptempo stuff like ""Losing my religion,"" this cd may put you to sleep."
3,Automatic for the People (part 2) - it is not!,"I approached this release with real trepidation. Could this album live up to all the hype? The press reviews were almost unanimous in their praise for, and approval of, Reveal. After the previous relative disasters of Monster, New Adventures in HiFi (Up wasn't too bad after repeated listenings) my expectations were not great. Unfortunately, Reveal had been compared to Automatic for the People. Big Mistake! After half a dozen listenings I can say that I'm not disappointed, neither am I overly impressed. A few good tracks spoiled by a few duds. My personal opinion is that they're running out of tunes. As to the lyrics - forget it. This is more drivel than usual. As a whole though, it stands up well since the care and commitment of the band is high as ever. Anyway, I suspect it'll grow on me a little more with repeated plays."
3,Where's Scott Litt?,"Hey, its ""Up"" part 2. The sound, again, is heavy on drum machines and synthesizers, with little of the power and drama that marked previous REM albums. C'mon guys, get over the loss of Bill Berry. What saves the album is ""Imitation of Life."" Otherwise, I thought REM openly represented that they'd break up by the year 2000. Guess what? They have. I don't know who this is."
2,Meager revelations,"2 1/2Its R.E.M. at their middle of road most. And believe me, they have walked further down the road, so here the mediocrity tends to at least produce minor results. Heck there's even a song or two that actually matter."
2,Disappointed...,not among REM's best. Berry was much more an ochestrator / coordinator / producer than I ever thought. And the infatuation w/ Brian Wilson has worn thin already. Average at best.
2,2 1/2 Stars,"Better than ""Up"" but still a world away from their best efforts, ""Reveal"" is a slow, almost boring disc.The electronic experimentation that dominated ""Up"" is lessened here but the release is still awash in horrid strings making it far too adult in nature to be truly engauging.The question has to be asked: ""Can the best band of the 80's/90's ever recover from the loss of Bill Berry?""The answer, so far anyway, is no."
2,"Boring, whiny","What is the big deal about Reveal? This is just a continuation of Up, which was a pretty lousy album. It's a bit better than Up, with slightly better melodies (notice I said ""slightly""), but it is still tedious and boring. And is it just me or does Stipe's voice get whinier-sounding on every outing? I know that voices do change with age, usually for the worse, so perhaps that is what happened here. But in Stipe's case, his style has gotten progressively more annoying. Compare the current high-pitched nasal whine with the earlier albums where he usually stayed in the lower octaves and had much more presence, albeit through mumbles. There is no contest. For a dead-on parody of the whiny, oh-so-precious and lyrically obtuse and vapid Stipe, check out the Corky And The Juice Pigs song ""REMember."""
1,"Oops, they did it again!","For the second time in a row I've been suckered into buying a new R.E.M. CD because I heard a single that sounded like early, great R.E.M. but ended up sounding like nothing else on the record. It happened last time with ""Daysleeper"" and now with ""Imitation of LIfe"" -- Be Warned-- There are maybe 3 and a half good songs on this CD, the rest of it blows and this is coming from someone who owns their entire catalog. Do yourself a favor and just buy the single for ""Imitation of Life"" because that song is great. Better yet, download the MP3 here and stay away from the B sides (I can't imagine)."
2,Proves once again that REM died in 1986,"Like (insert any REM album of the past 15 years) Reveal is bland, dull and tired. Buying a new REM record now is like buying a '90s Rolling Stones CD or the newest Star Wars movie on DVD. Why go for the work of artists so far past their prime? If you're into REM go buy the EP and their first 5 albums. And stop there."
1,TERRIBLE ALBUM from a once GREAT band!,"The only good thing I can say about this album is that I didn't actually pay any of my hard earned money for it. (I checked it out at the library.) As a long time REM fan, I have to say this album is not for ANY fan of REM's music - neither die hard fans of their early stuff, nor those who thought ""Losing My Religion"" was their debut hit will find much to enjoy here. The songs are overly ethereal and BORING! Mr. Stipe and the musicians even sound bored. (It seems that Bill Berry left the band just in time.) If I could give this album a half star I would. This would be a good album to listen to only if you are planning on joining some sort of mothership cult. Otherwise stick with pre-Reveal REM albums."
1,Not for long time REM fans!,"I have been a REM fan since the mid eighties and have stuck with the band through many different artistic directions. I began to loose interest in the band with each album since ""Hi-Fi"". ""Up"" was different and the three man lineup didn't work for me. On Reveal, REM has offered a boring collection of keyboard-drenched pop. If you were a fan of this band when they actually produced some of the best music in the country....BEWARE, THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR YOU. If you are into keyboard [stuff] and just got into the band after they broke out as a threesome, you'll love it! The album is depressing as well. The only thing I can figure about REM's demise is that the music has gotten worse since Stipe shaved his head. Grow your hair back and get off your ... activist soap box.....as for me, I'll just listen to the earlier albums!"
1,REM has officially gone down the [drain]...,"It's so sad to see a GOOD band such as REM making...music like this. I'm sure they will say that they are trying something new, that's a nice of saying that they don't really care anymore. Do yourself a favor, if you are a TRUE REM fan, bypass this catastrophic flop of an album, for your own sake!"
2,Their Worst Album Ever,"I've been an REM fan since Murmur was released, but I can say without a doubt that this is their worst album. Almost every song sounds the same and every song is dull. Reading the five star reviews below makes me wonder if we listened to the same album. Unfortunately, after the brilliant ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi"", REM's recordings are just not that interesting anymore."
4,It's staying in my CD changer,"I must admit first off that I have been a long time fan, ever since the ""Radio Free Europe"" EP. Yes, my early REM stuff is on LP's! But most of the songs on this CD are excellent; why I am not hearing them on the radio is beyond me. The production work on this album is also outstanding. The synths on ""The Lifting"" give me chills, and the feedback guitar on ""Chorus and the Ring"" is inspired. If you kind of gave up after ""Monster"" like me, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed."
4,REM: 'Reveal'ing new Revelations,"In the midst of another brainless summer of squeaky-clean-cut music releases, I am plum-proud to be the amitious owner of a CD actually worth its own ... price tag. And that delicious deal of a record would be REM's latest release, ""Reveal"". Let me just get it out now, there is not a single hint of stinch on this sizzling summer selection. Rather, every single song from ""The Lifting"" to ""Beachball"" delivers a taste of delicious lighthearteness and pleasure for any summer scout to indulge. Which isn't to say there's nothing serios on this album, either. The tingly ""I'll Take the Rain"" is a swift and sad summer song that packs a punch along with a strong message. ""I've Been High"" is also another lavish and lovely piece that inspires and soars. With ""Reveal"", REM have supplied a more-than-decent album to fans that will surely quench the thirst of overheated listners across the country, who are in the midst of the usual putrid and precocious pop summer compilations."
4,Headphones,"Though not masterpiece that many advance reviews might have you believe, Reveal is a solid and soaring album that'll spin in my player throughout the summer. Missing are vocal contributions from Mike Mills (for the most part) and the organic feeling that Scott Litt's production lent to older REM records, but we still find here intelligent lyrics, engaging melodies, and more guitar work from Peter Buck than on Up. All the naysayers who are crying that REM has sold out and should hang it up should just face up to the fact that, no, REM are not going to save music again. But that doesn't mean that they aen't offering a viable product."
5,Reveal,"REM is my favourite band.Eventhough reveal cannot be considered to be their best album, it is better than most of the stuff which is being churned out in the name of music.My favourite song in this album is ""i've been high"" sung so beautifully by Stipe.Rest of the songs are excellant but songs like ""saturn returns"" take some time to grow on you.Many people make this mistake of writing off REM on their first listening.In this album may be ""imitation of life"" is catchy in first listening.After 3 or 4 listenings you could see the magic of REM.You will simply fall in love with these songs.That's what happened to me and now Reveal is in my collection as one of my favourite albums."
1,What have I done to deserve this?,"I have been a big, big, big fan since their early stuff. Back then they were like a breath of fresh air on the music scene. Now, it's like they aren't even trying. I hate to rate any album of theirs this bad, but I was so disappointed with this one. I resent spending my hard earned money on something they obviously spent no time or thought into. I'll hold out hope for one more decent album but this one surely is not it."
2,"Didn't reveal much, except ...","... except I ought to sometimes think twice about shelling out my hard-earned money on what was once a fantastic band. Not just a waste of money, but of time as well. An embarassing dip into mediocrity."
2,sleeper,"I'm a long time REM fan, but this CD is fairly boring. The true test for me is what stays on my CD player, and frankly this one just doesn't make the cut. A few interesting songs, interrupted by long periods of uninteresting ""muzak."""
1,major disappointment,"I have loved R.E.M. since my college days back in '84, but other than Stipe's voice I would never guess that this cd is them. This is a collection of slow paced dirges. Stipe's voice cannot carry an entire album, but that's about all that's there. Do they not play guitar or bass anymore? I will continue to buy R.E.M. cd's as soon as they come out in the hopes that they have another gem left in them, but I'm not holding my breath. One star is probably too generous. I have no idea what some of the other reviewers are listening to."
3,Slow but still sweet,"I first became hooked on R.E.M. after they hit the big time with revolutionary modern rock gems such as 1987's ""Document"" and 1989's ""Green."" R.E.M. always provides the ears with the royal treatment. ""Reveal,"" however, comes up short of doing this. The album tracks plod along at a snail's pace when compared to 'Stand' or 'Losing My Religion,' and there is little evidence of songs written strictly for the purpose of extended FM radio play. But, despite its flaws, the album reveals bottomless emotional depth and sets a laid- back tone that puts your mind at ease, and that is why I would recommend this album for purchase."
5,Back to Basics for REM,"Thought the last few REM albums were not bad, they did not quite live up to the bar that was raised when they released ""Green"" and ""Out of Time."" Finally an album that reminds us why REM has been a mainstay on the music scene for the last 15 years. There are a few weirder tracks (most notably ""Saturn Return"") the gems of the album are ""The Lifting"", ""Imitation of Life"" and ""All the Way to Reno"". I am ""humming all the way"" through this one. Thanks to Stipes and the gang for returning to a sound that really works for one of my all time favorite music groups."
3,"Respectable, But Not Brilliant","First of all, my true rating on this is 3.5 stars. When ""Up"" was released, I felt the end was near. ""Airportman"" is terrible, and the CD was inconsistent and derivative. I respect the band's effort to experiment, but ""Up"" just didn't work. ""Reveal"" walks through the door opened by ""Up,"" and with mixed results. There is a consistency to ""Reveal,"" but many of the songs don't hit the bullseye. For fans of the band who prefer a guitar-oriented sound, this effort may be very disappointing. Personal favorites include ""Reno,"" ""Saturn Return"" and ""Chorus and the Ring."""
4,Drowsy but nice,"The best thing about REM is that no two albums sound the same. Reveal is probably their slowest album yet, the kind of thing that will put you to sleep on a warm summer day. Its most similar to Up but the electronics sound less artificial and there's some nice acoustic guitar throughout. Its a sleeper, and its apparent that REM is sick of uptempo stuff like 'losing my religion' and 'the one i love'. Great stuff, especially in such a bad year for music, but not as well done as Up, New Adventures, or Automatic. Better than Monster, though, because even if its a drowser they still spent the time to put it together nicely."
1,Drowning,"Reveal is muddled and tuneless, drowning in synthesizers and drum machine beats there only to satisfy someone's misguided notion of 'art'. Full of random notes sung by Michael Stipe, the CD meanders aimlessly, unsure what direction to go in. 'Imitation of Life' -- yes, that is exactly what this CD is, and exactly what REM has descended to. Synthesizers and drum machines -- imitators of life."
3,average at best,"come on! this cant be compared to Fables or Pageant. these reviews calling it beautiful! come on! if you want beautiful, buy a Red House Painters album. Is this a bad album? No, its just a lot of melody-lacking material. with that said, its much, much better than Monster, Out of Time or the forgetable Automatic for the People."
3,halfway to diamond (actually about 40%),"so, apparently, bill berry was the true genius of REM -- who woulda thunk it? don't believe all the ""bold return to form"" nonsense that's surrounded REVEAL in the weeks proceeding its release; this second post-berry offering is a stale, unsteady repeat of the underwhelming UP -- in fact, the two records could be combined to make one of the most boring double albums in history. more than anything, stipe and company sound old and uninspired on REVEAL -- with only the occassional flash of the old athens magic (""i've been high"", ""chorus and the ring"") shining through now and then to keep the true belivers hanging on a while longer. and if for nothing else, REVEAL will be remembered as the home of REM's worst song ever, ""she just wants to be"", which is so bland and awkward that it just might be a summertime radio hit. i can't wait."
3,"Boring, Bad, REM- If that is possible","This album was not an REM album I've been trying to tell myself. It can't be. Why? It isn't any good. Why 3 stars then? Becuase it's REM and they are my favorite band. The album is like Up. But not as good. It is a bad Up. The songs are soft and boring, good music to fall asleep too. The only good song is Imitation of Life, which is actually upbeat and peppy. But, the rest of the album blends together, and it doesn't mix together well."
4,"Mellow and lovely, a great Summer album","This one is for those who loved the style of Life's Rich Pagent"", Many of the songs are like REM's ""Flowers of Guatemala"" and are just great for a mellow return to the old REM sound and lyrics that are poetry even if they dont always make obvious sense! Enjoy."
2,"They should have called it ""Down""","because that's the musical direction they're heading after the brilliant ""Up."" I've listened to this thing several times and it just continues to disappoint me. I'm a way-back fan...bought one of the original copies of ""Radio Free Europe"" at Wax'n'Facts the week it was released (I still have it!), and I've fallen in and out with these guys over the years. With ""Up"" they seemed to have really broken out and cruised into some new territory, but this new one just feels like a retreat to safety...almost formulaic, if you will. Sorry, all you 5-star guys, this one just doesn't cut it."
3,Not The Magic I'd Hoped For,"I've been an REM fan since the beginning, but this disc just didn't do much for me. I gave it plenty of time, listening to it in its entirety at least 10 times, but it just didn't happen. The songs are nice enough in themselves, but they simply didn't reach out and grab me like much of their earlier work did. I'll try it again some day but for now, this one is headed for the shelf. At least the sound quality is excellent."
4,"Neo-Classical guitar, very melodic music.","Vinnie Moore follows in the footsteps of our founding father ""Yngwie Malmsteen"". Vinnie however, shows some real nice talent and really is a damn good guitarist. He is a very clean and fast player and has some cool songs on this CD. It's worth hearing. ""Saved By A Miracle"", ""Mind's Eye"", ""Hero Without Honor"" are some killer tracks off this CD. Many people say he just wants to be like ""Yngwie"", and maybe that's true, or maybe it's just jealousy. I wish I could play half as good as these guys, but no matter how you slice it, this guy can rip up the fretboard with the best of em, and plays great on the acoustic guitar, as shown on this CD. I would not hesitate to tell some one to go and buy this CD just for the melodies alone, but his playing is worth hearing as well."
5,Wordless!,There are no words in the english language that can describe the emotional impact this book will have on people sensitive to the African plight
2,The Middle Passage:White Ships/Black Cargo,"Tom Feelings book the Middle Passage is an excellent book to use with students to help them learn about a topic that is often ignored (slavery). The images are striking and casue students to delve deeply into their emotional being to identfy the true feelings of slavery during a horrendous period of time. This books created great discussions and my students were able to broaden their scope on several topics: the middle passage, slavery, emancipation, etc. The best visual read that my students and I have had in a life time."
1,Too Scary for Kids,"This is a book that is too dark and scary for children. The book contains black and white illustrations of violent and frightening scenes. One implies slave rape. Another shows rats eating the corpses of dead Africans. One quote from the introduction states, ""many [Africans]... chose suicide--mainly by jumping into the shark-infested ocean,"" As someone who has a Masters degree in early American history, I think discussing this subject is vital to the American dialogue. However, the style of this book is not fit for a child. I would rank this book without a star if Amazon's rating system would allow me to do so."
2,A lovely book,I am thankful of other reviews that gave me a heads up that this was not the same as the original Walter Farley books. I believe this is a lovely book but prefer my Little Black goes to the circus original edition.
5,Timeless Children's Book,"I had this book when I was a child and would read it over and over. When I has my two children I bought it for them and it quickly became a favorite. Now I have grandchildren and a foster son. The exciting and heart felt tale of ""Little Black, A Pony"" is still in demand when we all gather around to read."
5,Absolutly wonderful!,"I read this series of books when I was young, and now I am excited to be able to share them with my 3 year old daughter. I gave her Little Black, A Pony and Little Black Goes To The Circus for Christmas. It's only December 26th now and she has already wanted to hear the books read multiple times! I'm now scrambling to find others in the series. It's a sweet, simple story of friendship with beautiful, expressive artwork."
4,A must-read!,"Alistair Moray recorded eleven months of his life as a rum smuggler between 1923 and 1924. Moray was recruited in Glasgow, Scotland, to be a crewmember on a rum ship that brought 20,000 cases of liquor to New York. On his voyage, he endured terrible storms and witnessed fistfights. Crossing the Atlantic in itself was an ordeal, but selling the cargo while evading the law was an equal challenge. Moray shares the inside tricks of smuggling, such as secret codes and price setting, giving the reader a glimpse of the dangerous, highly-corrupt world of the rum-runner. If this subject interests you, then you should read the newest book on the subject:Alcohol, Boat Chases, and Shootouts! How the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Fought Rum Smugglers and Pirates (Part I: 1919-1924)"
3,mind-bending sci fi,"I describe this movie as ""Memento meets Sixth Sense""; it keeps you guessing right until the end, and a lot of what you guess is going on, may or may not be! Acting is consistently good, production qualities too. I like the little touches, like nobody driving while talking on their cellphone."
2,Partner's makes for reasonable viewing,"Action-man Casper Van Dien and Comedy-man Casper Van Dien team up for this moderately funny comedy-adventure, directed by Joey Travolta (yep, that's John's Brother).Bob (Paymer) is a confused man. The one thing he has going for him is a computer program that he plans to sell to the highest bidder. Before he can even get to the buyer though, a street smart drifter (Van Dien) knocks it off - only to discover that he's not going to get pay dirt without Bob. They team up.Unbeknown to Bob, the 'potential girlfriend' who has helped him find a buyer for his computer program doesn't exactly half his best interests at heart; the same goes for Van Dien's character's girlfriend, whose one-tracked mind revolved around the green stuff.Plenty of double crossing, madcap moments and cheesy one-liners in this surprisingly chuckle-worthy film."
5,Favorite sneakers!,I am petite and I love the lift these sneakers provide. They are easy to walk in and the high platform is like walking on a cloud. I always buy Volatile sneakers and I am always satisfied. They were shipped in a timely fashion as well.
1,Volatile Sneaker,Thought I would love these shoes when I got them but after wearing them for awhile my feet started to hurt. I wish I could wear them all day but I had to change my shoes half way through the work day. Disappointed:(
2,Size fits small,"I normally wear a 6.5 and I ordered size 6.5 and they fit very tight, my toes were very smashed and I couldnt wear them. I ended up selling them to my coworker who wears size 4 and she loves them.I was very happy with the shoes otherwise, they were lightweight, clean, and arrived very quickly. I was dissapointed they didnt fit.I may try again and just order a size bigger."
3,High heeled tennies,I would have kept them but my family said that they looked like corrective shoes that a handicapped person would wear so I returned them.
4,Nice lift,"I have been looking for platform sneakers since I wore out my other ones. No one sells them anymore. I got lucky and found these, Volatile Women's elevation Platform Sneaker, White Leather. They clean very easily. These sneakers look and feel nice. They are not heavy like other platform sneakers I have worn, but still not for athletic use, I would recommend regular sneakers for the gym ;-). I like my platform sneakers because I am 5'3"" (short, by societies standards). They fit good and look just like the picture. These sneakers arrived promptly and in good condition. I am impressed with the service I received and would buy them again.I am adding this extra after I really broke the shoes in... I have an all tile house and walked in from the rain and almost slipped. These shoes are extremly slippery when they get wet... So, I lowered my star rating.Volatile Women's Elevation Platform Wedge Sneaker"
4,IfTheReviewerBelowThoughtThisWasBadHeShouldHearMerzbow,"Wolf Eyes, Dread (Bulb, 2002)Oh, HELL yeah. The mighty Wolfies deliver four tracks of rhythmic noise, distorted vocals (distorted like Sutcliffe Jugend, not distorted like death metal), and all around crunchy goodness. Two long tracks (Desert of Glue, Wretched Hog and Half Animal, Half Insane) are bookended by two short tracks (Burn Your House Down and Let the Smoke Rise). The four songs are all so different in execution it's hard to point to one and say ""this is best,"" but really, ""Burn Your House Down"" is so frenetic and noisy that everything afterwards kind of sounds like an anticlimax. (An excellent anticlimax, mind you). Are Wolf Eyes the best thing that ever came out of Michigan? It's entirely possible. ****"
5,werewolves r us.,"if instead of worrying about the occupation of international financing operations by vampires, lee scratch perry was in fact a werewolf employed part-time at a failing k-mart in a michigan suburb where heavy industry had left sometime in the 1970's and went home to a converted garage apartment with cheap wood paneling with black-light posters depicting mountains and trees illuminated by electrical storms while he manufactured songs on thrift-store electronic devices held together by duct tape he would have very likely produced this album, possibly the crowning glory of wolf eyes' career thus far. like quaaludes triumphing over a ritalin overdose: both discontinuous (fragmented bleeping plus eruptions) yet pleasingly monotonous (thudding, banging, pounding), this is a decomissioned war chariot of an overloaded station wagon with too many miles on it reconverted for the bearing of the heaviest of dread in initimable fashion."
3,response,"reading the two forgoing one-star reviews of ""dread"", or any number of responses to wolf eyes' live sets posted on sy's online discussion boards, is evidence that for every ""wannabe hipster punk"" [sic] cringing and nodding along in insincerity, there is at least one ""buckle-headed fascist,"" to use byron coley's term, waiting in the wings. knee-jerk gainsaying like this can make me forget the fawning fanboys (and girls) showing up at animal collective and lightning bolt shows with increasingly embarassing questions for the performers, and give me a little hope that noise music may continue to thrive in semi-obscurity for the moment.with regards to the complaints raised in these reviews, wolf eyes need no justification for those who have been moved by them. visitors to the salon jeered at Manet's Olympia and audience members smashed seats at the premiere of La Régle du jeu. the reviewers here would do well to keep this in mind."
5,Love It!!,I love this CD! My sister and I always used to listen to this on a cassette tape when we were young and I was excited to find it on a CD.
2,Charisma Outweighs Clunky,"Edit: I had previously mistakenly identified this as a feature edit of a serial.The print quality is watchable, but rather poor, just what you might expect from this budget company (Alpha). This is not a restored or digitally improved print by any means.Houdini has a lot of charisma and is obviously doing MOST of the action work himself. He's fun to watch, but ultimately, if you are someone who wants to see this at all, you'd probably prefer to see a better print, if one exists.Assuming we have most of the film here, the pacing/editing is clunky and the acting style is more like 1908 than 1922. OK, I'm exaggerating....somewhat.Still, Houdini is worth it in the long run, for curiosity's sake if nothing else. Hopefully, better prints of his surviving film work will make it to DVD."
3,man from beyond not so good.,"I bought this because it has houdini in it. Watching it, it's clear whyHoudini's production company folded quickly. I give it 3 stars forit's historic value only. There is not any rewatch potential here,and unless you are very interested in houdini, you will have a toughtime getting through even one viewing."
3,new age stuff from the crypt,"as far as I'm concerned all silents are classics. Just realizing Houdini is in this movie is at least as interesting as it being a silent film. This one clearly shows Houdini's underlying esoteric beliefs. The idea someone could be frozen for 100 years then just come to life, and meet a person who looks like his old love is corn in the first degree. His belief in Reincarnation is evident here. But it's a bit of an eye opener to see him use ancients such as Zoroaster, and Jesus to back his beliefs when it's clear Jesus does not. So we see that twisting things to fit your beliefs stretches waaay back, and it not a modern phenomena.Intersting stunts when you realize they all did their own stunts back then. the music was a bit distracting, as it didn't match the mood of the action at all times. Still an interesting yarn and a quality reproduction. I seem to have little or no problem loading all CD's from this company on my lower cost DVD player."
1,is Faux River using artifical sheep?,"These are NOT Merino socks - they are HALF (55%) Merino wool; the rest is man-made materials. The front of the label makes no mention of the fact that these are only partially wool - nor does this ad. This isn't the first time I've found Faux River falsely representing their products, they have another pair that with a label that says ""Merino Wool"" in a large font on the front, and ""17% Merino / Wool blend"" in a small font on the back.Nor am I impressed with the build of the sock itself. Most hiker socks have more padding on the heel, and toe seams that are better hidden.They're comfortable enough for use around the house, and I'd give more stars if they had more honesty and a lower cost."
5,good book,"A very good organization, I recommend those for whom security is important, but who don't want complications."
4,"Nice collection of hacks, though not a lot unique","This is a nice, useful collection of 125 hacks to help secure your network and systems. If you've read a couple dozen or more other security books and spend a lot of time reading security-related websites, there isn't much in this book that you haven't already seen elsewhere. It is nice to have it all in one book though. This is well written and has proven to be a worthwhile reference on my book shelf on several occasions.I don't feel this book is suitable for absolute beginners to information security. For those without much infosec background, seek an introductory security book prior to diving into this one.The Windows coverage is very light. If you run a Windows-only network, this book doesn't offer a lot for you, but still may be a worthwhile purchase. For those running a mixed network or primarily BSD and Linux systems, it offers much more value."
4,insight into security,Security has been high on my list of things to understand and master these past two years. Our company's firewall has been breached numerous times. This has scared the living daylights out of our stakeholders. I have therefore been forced to become an expert. This is one of the books that has helped me attain this level of understanding. It offers insights not available in regular how to guides on security.
4,Power lineup from this solo artist,"This album contains the masterful Billy Sheehan on Bass and Steve Smith on drums (from Mr. Big and Journey respectfully)If you are a guitar fan, this is for you"
5,Killin',"This CD is killin, Tony MacAlpine is the MAN. Every track is stupid good and his technique is unbelieveable. His musical vocabulary is way bigger than even Yngwie's ever was. A few of u may have a hard time stomaching that, but it's the real deal, just like this CD. If u wanna hear a ferocious attack on virtuosic guitar, buy this album!"
2,Older version better,"Limited play variations make this game inferior to earlier CD Rom versions... Grafix slight upgrade over older version, audio can be a bit annoying."
3,No Ultimate Risk,"Risk I for PC was an awesome game, because it includes the Ultimate Risk. This is where winning the battle is by using different stredegy cards. This version of the Risk is the best. But Risk 2 doesn't have this feature. I highly recommond to try Risk I's ultimate game, it is so much FUN!!"
3,Sail On Software - Dishonest Company,"We ordered a DVD through Amazon via Sail On. They sent us a used DVD (no packaging), which did not work. After stringing us along, we returned the DVD and were promised a replacement or refund. Needless to say, they have avoided our e-mails since. I would recommend NOT dealing with Sail On Software."
