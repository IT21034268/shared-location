4,Enjoyable,"This was an enjoyable read. Gruen managed to get me lost in the world of the 1930's circus.The only issue I had was that Gruen didn't do a very good job of writing how Jacob and Marlena fell in love. Suddenly, Jacob was announcing his love for her with very little interaction between the two. Love at first sight? I don't know. Marlena seemed like a fairly weak character for love at first sight to come into play. Why was Jacob so enthralled?Other than the above, I liked the book very much. I enjoyed the easy read."
5,Great used book,"Great Used Condition,thank-you. Good story, but I'm not much into the Circus, so I didn't fully appreciate the contents."
2,It was just alright,I have no idea what the hoopla is about but I find this book to be just alright at best. It is a little slow. The characters didnt have any passion or oomph. It was just very blah to me. I do like Reese Witherspoon and Rob so maybe the movie will be more entertaining.
2,Basically a Romance,"As a long time high school English teacher, I probably have a different set of standards (not better, just different) than some people in evaluating novels, and I'm sure others really liked this book. It does have some insights to circus life in the depression, and if you don't have a background on the depression, there are also some moving revelations about the difficulty of survival for working stiffs. However, I felt the plot just had too many coincidences and contrivances to make it believable. The story was really driven by Jacob's idealized love for Marlena and I found the ending for them (and Rosie) unsatisfying - just too much of a romance (I should have been warned off by the picture on the cover, but I had made a commitment that I would read it.) If you are looking for a good read on the struggle of working men during the depression, try Steinbeck's ""In Dubious Battle"" (not a romance in sight!)."
2,Let Down,"This book has been hyped up by many of my friends. I was excited when the price was lower because I wanted to read it. It took me weeks to finish because I wasn't interested. There was too much ""jump"" from one time period to another. I understand the Author's purpose, but I was truly disappointed."
3,loved the circus parts,"I really wanted to like this book.And I did enjoy the circus parts.But part of the book was told from the perspective of the main character as a nursing home patient. That part was a real downer.It gave me the same feeling as reading ""Julie and Julia""."
5,Waterford Elephants??,"When someone recommended this book to me I thought they said Waterford Elephants. I thought it might be about China collectible elephants. Seriously though, this book was fabulous. I couldn't put the book down."
4,Liked the audio-book version,"This story helped me in gaining a better understanding of what it is to be elderly. The audio version is narrated by two men, both are meant to be the main character, one voice representing his twenties and the other is in his nineties. It certainly isn't centered around being of an advanced age, but as a side story, it was still very clear.I was pleasantly surprised by my conflicted response to the story. On the one hand, his lamentations over being at the end of his life made me sad; on the other hand, he was funny and his life was a full one, giving him many wonderful memories.My advice to a prospective listener or reader? If you are bored with the first chapter, hang in there, it picks up and is worth getting to the end."
4,Great read,Loved the movie. The book is great. Book goes into greater detail and is more enjoyable. Must read for all.
4,Moving story about living your life to the fullest,"After reading several reviews, I think that many readers may have missed the entire point of ""Water for Elephants"". Some reviewers said that the book didn't say much about circus life and some say they did not care about learning about the circus. ""WFE"" teaches us that it is ok to rememeber fondly those most rewarding experiences throughout your life but also that it is never too late to create new experiences. It also provides us with a unique perspective of everyday life in a senior living facility...a place that many of us may end up in one day."
4,The best story I have read in 2007,"In the great depression, a young man drops out of Veterinary school and joins a travelling circus. The story unfolds in flashbacks from his present day existence in a nursing home. The author takes us into a world of cruelty, privation and danger, which is nevertheless full of adventure and the possibility of love. The story grabs you quickly. I couldn't put this one down. I told my friends about it, and the ones who actually started it were hooked too!The writer creates believable characters, and I found myself caring about them. Perhaps some were larger than life, but it helped the story. Was the circus really this grim and dangerous in the 1930's? I do not know, but Sara Gruen makes it entirely believable.This book occupied all of my spare time for several days, and that is just what I hope for when I pick up a new one. The ending was a little bit contrived, but I have forgiven authors for much worse. Get your hands on this one; you won't be sorry."
5,Almost quit reading but...,"So glad I did not. My mother is going the getting old thing, with the memory loss and failing body and the book was painful for me to read. But like the others I loved it could not put it down. The unusual thing is, I finished it a week or so ago and it is still heavy on my mind. This is very unusual for me. I have recommended it to many people and will continue to do so."
4,Slow start but strong finish,"Water for Elephants is told through the ""90 something"" year old man in a retirement as he relives his life which came back to him when the circus comes to town. The main character goes through some tough times and finds himself working for the circus a world he knows nothing about. He then falls for a girl who is about as off limits as she can be. This book is a very entertaining book that may start off a bit slow but once it picks up you can't stop reading until it's all over. Fantastic book for a summer read!"
2,A big dissapointment,"With all the positive ratings I had high hopes for this book. But, alas, I couldn't help wondering what all the fuss was about. I found the story fairly boring and eventually couldn't wait to be done with it. It's another romance, set in a circus. The characters were not that appealing and the book could probably have been condensed to half the verbage. Suffice it to say I didn't like it."
5,Great Book!!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It sucked you in and gave you everything you wanted! The price is GREAT too!! I wish more authors would price books this cheap!
3,Steven Richard,"A good summer beach read. It's a predictable, but entertaining story. If you're looking for some education about the history of the Depression era circus business, this isn't the book. As it goes on, it turns into a somewhat sappy love story with little suspense. I was able to guess all of the culminating events about 20 pages before they happened. Overall, it's worth the purchase to read on the beach sand or during a vacation."
2,A chore to read,"I purchased this book because I liked the title. The writing style is the biggest problem I had with this story. It is a book that you could set down at any moment and never pick up again. I had to MAKE myself read this, and it was grueling at times. That being said, the story line itself is quite good, which has saved this book from getting one star instead of two from me. I haven't seen the movie yet, but my inclination is that it would be much better than reading the book... and if not, at least it would be over in 2 hours!"
1,Water For Elephants,"This is a terrible story-dark, cruel, and abusive. The abuse of the animals was too much, I couldn't get past that and ended up not finishing the book. In fact, I deleted it entirely from my Kindle!"
3,Not the Cleanest,"Water for Elephants was a great book, but I could have done without all of the sexual content and swearing. There was no need for it in the plot of the story."
1,In the minority I guess,"Wow! I cannot imagine what people see in this book.It's so extremely shallow and artificial in all respects. The relationships between the characters, the character development, the supposed villains.If you're looking for a super basic, easy summer read for the beach, then okay, check this out. But if your looking for substance, sense, depth, or something to keep your attention beyond the first quarter or third of the story, look elsewhere. I'm not big on ""summer reads"" or ""romance"" novels - if you are, you'll probably enjoy this.Also steer clear if you're not into senseless use of the ""F"" word and random sex, and keep in mind it's also written at a very basic reading level 8th or 9th grade I think (although it's not content appropriate for those ages).Thank goodness I got it for free on the Kindle!"
1,"Strange, feels like your reading about porn","The book was weird. I felt like I was reading a porn book or something. The description on how the female dances, it goes all into details even how she touches her boobs she even goes naked. I don't get it is she a a circus whore? I didn't want to read a book on how she touches herself... so im returning,Im not into that kinda of reads. Maybe it is not like that as in whole book? but its an early start for dirty things so I assume the rest of the book is the same."
4,a great story,"This is a great book - a wonderful story filled with romance, mystery, suspense and humor. The main character is an elderly assisted living resident and he tells the story alternatively from the perspectives of the present and from his young adult past. The writing is excellent, giving a very real voice to the feelings of old age and the need for dependence on others, as well as to the passion and excitement of first love. My one reservation with the book is that the ending seemed rushed and didn't have the careful reflection that was so important throughout the book. Overall, it is an excellent book - enjoy."
5,Water For Elephants,"Wonderful, unpredictable story! Fall in love with many different characters and story lines and grow to despise others."
5,Great Book - Even better as an Audiobook but get both!,"Absolutely loved the book (audiobook actually). And I have more than a 6th grade education. Go figure.Not having ever been in a 1930's circus (especially since I wasn't born until 1953), I can't say whether or not the characters were true to life. I do know and have read extensively about cruelty to animals and am not surprised this sort of thing could happen in a 1930's circus. It was a believable story to me and loved the ending.I listened to the book on audiotape on my morning walks and I intend to buy a hard cover copy of the book because it is one I will reread again and want to keep in my library."
5,Way better than the movie..,"This book was a great read. It's simple to follow and very descriptive. I will admit that I bought the book to read once I heard a movie was being made from it, but it surpasses the movie in great lengths! The movie was sorta like this book but not completely. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
4,Finally a Good Novel,"Gruen not only tells a good story about the early circus trains, but she also uses her research to add credibility. Her sophisticated style and vocabulary make for pleasurable reading."
4,Loved this book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a really good story but also sad. The end was a little far fetched, but worth your time."
3,"Interesting story, hated the ending",A very unique tale and exposure to a world that I would never have thought to read about. Interesting love story. Could have done without the raunchy descriptions throughout. The ending was very unrealistic and kind of ruined the book for me personally.
4,Water for Elephants,Excellent!! A wonderful review of early Circus days and a very sensitive look at the elderly and the meaning of life. Thank You!!
5,Water for Elephants audio book,Pure excellence!! Better than the movie. Have listened to it 3 times already and have lent it to friends that have loved it as much as I have. Highly recommend. Purchased through Amazon.com.
4,Interesting book,"The details and descriptions were wonderful, but the story could've been a little tighter. Good characters and an absorbing read, overall."
5,Perfect!,"The book came super fast, packaged perfectly and in perfect condition. Everything I'd expeced it to be. Could hardly believe the speed in which I received it."
4,water for elephants,"I enjoyed this book, admired the main character. I ran nursing homes as part of my work history and you do get to meet some very remarkable characters. That have lead very interesting lives. It is so easy to look at that wrinkled old man and think he had always been like that. If you are lucky you get to know the history behind that face. This book did that for its readers."
3,Average book,"I bought this book because it was doing well on the bestsellers list and seemed to have great reviews. To be honest I found the prose a bit long winded, especially in the beginning. Yes, it's a ""telling"" story, narrated by the main character, but I found it overly dry. The first few pages held my interest (mildly) and I struggled to read the next few chapters. After about five or six I ended up skimming through most of the book. Certainly some of Ms. Gruen's descriptions of circus life are interesting and make for an unsual setting and back drop...but I felt most of the characters were flat and lacked emotional depth. The last chapter held my interest some and I found it easy to pick up on it even though I skimmed. This tells me the middle didn't make an impact on me. Maybe more dialogue was needed, I don't know. But for me something was definately missing. Sorry Ms. Gruen, this is my honest opinion. I wish I could've given it a better review. I hope the next novel is better."
3,Like climbing up a hill and flying off,"The story takes about 75% of the book to finally start developing. Once you get to the main love story, you're pretty much done with the book, and I felt under-whelmed. I put down a couple of times but ultimately finished it because I was so far into the book already. The last quarter of the book goes by fairly quickly and is then harder to put down, but just getting to that point can be tedious. The pace is fairly slow. It is written in a Mitch Albom style, in which the story alternates between the past and the present, and ultimately finishes with the past catching up to the present. Several memorable quotes which are highlighted in the Kindle edition were good. All-in-all I was slightly disappointed. Some characters completely fell off the map, only to reappear later in the book and you almost forget they were ever really apart of the book. Still haven't seen the movie, and not really interested in doing so at this point. Ready to move on to the next read."
3,I was misled,"I was misled by the title, but liked the book's style. Water for elephants is only a phrase that triggers the memories of the 93-year-old protangonist who resides in a nursing home. The flashbacks seem predictable, like the parents' death, and some of the material is for the mature only. (Not kids.) The ending may not please but it is a surprise."
3,Water for elephants,"Definitely worth reading. It offers a great look at life in an on-the-road circus, but it also provides a good look at what goes on in the mind of a 90-something who has seen and lived a lot, but who believes he has been put out to pasture.I would have given the book probably five stars if it hadn't contained so much profanity and scatological language. The old man's tale would have done a very good job of living on its own without that."
3,fast read,"I read this book in the space of a day. I found it easy to read, informative and well researched. While I enjoyed the writing, if I had known beforehand it contained animal cruelty, [even though it is fiction] I would not have purchased it."
2,I'm really mad at this book.,"I heard from a few people that this is a good read... Not true. The idea of the story is interesting, but it is written like a bad television-remake set during the time period. I did finish it, but I closed the book angry and disappointed. That being said- I realize that I'm in the minority and I've spoken to other people who really enjoyed reading it. Just isn't for me I suppose."
3,just a fun read.,"This book is just a fun read. Nothing deep or realistic about the story. Nothing to be learned. No point. Just entertainment. Don't expect to connect with any of the characters because they are totally unrealistic. This book is just pure fantasy, almost childish. I did find the book worth reading, not a waste of time because it is entertaining. However, am I compelled to buy another book from this author? Probably not. Am I going to recommend it to my friends? Probably so with the disclaimer that it is a light fun read."
2,"All hype, no content!","Underwhelming! Moderately entertaining, but sorely lacking in true depth. I felt like if it had been three times longer it could have been a good book. I've read many romance novels that were much more absorbing than this."
2,Pablum,"Required no thinking. Boring and trite. I can't imagine why this book is so popular. (In fact, I read it a few years ago but it popped up here and I wanted to review it now to give another point of view to the multitudes who adored it.)"
3,Just okay,Didn't love this one as much as the other reviewers. Some good moments with dialogue and plot but that I just didn't find myself enthralled by the story. It was a little slow at times. Kept putting it down and picking it up. Just all right.
2,Couldn't get into it,It wasn't obviously my type of book. Maybe it was because I had such a high expectation? The best part of the book was the author's note at the end. I enjoyed reading that.
3,Nothing wow-ish,"I was torn between two or three stars. I read this book for my book club, otherwise it is unlikely I would have picked it up considering my backlog.Personally I didn't find anything wow-ish or over the top astounding with this story. Besides that it takes place in a circus. It had its moments of course, which makes me think that what really makes you like a book is not sometimes the overall story, but a couple of scenes that really stand out. And this had a handful of those, especially those set in the present time, which were the only ones to actually pull my emotional strings, which usually doesn't take much I'm afraid, and considering that this book didn't stir much in me overall. Not even the traditional `big twist' scene riled me up. I actually read a paragraph past it then did a double take on `oh that was suppose to be it'."
4,Great story,It is has been quite awhile since I have had the time to enjoy reading a fictional story and this was the perfect one to get me back into it. All of the characters were greatly depicted and the story was so whimsical yet at times gripping and exciting. I loved it.
4,Wonderfully Addictive,Took me a little while to get into the story but I was intrigued after meeting Barbara and learning the goings-on behind the scenes at the circus. The main character is both a naive college kid and a cranky yet oddly charming old man and the story bounces back and fourth between these two eras. A must read for anyone!
5,Water for Elephants,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Especially as we have aging parents who are also in their 90's. Poinant and relevant, a delightful read."
4,Never Forget,"No, I won't forget WATER FOR ELEPHANTS any time soon. The prologue is one of the best I've read in a long time. I actually called a friend and ready it to her out loud. The characters, in particular, Rosie the elephant and Jacob are accurate and tender, each in their own sometimes sad and poignant way. This book is a summer hit for a reason--it's an enjoyable read filled with the peculiarities of circus life that intrigue and woo all who are drawn to such a menagerie known as the ""Greatest Show on Earth."" ~Carol D. O'Dell"
4,Book Review,Our book club just read and reviewed this book. What an interesting story. We all loved Rosie and were genuinely amazed at who killed one of the main characters. It was presented one way at the onset of the book and then a surprise unraveling at the end. This book made for a very good book review at our last meeting. Passing it along to friends.
5,A Wonderful Read,I liked this book so much that I bought several copies to give for holiday presents this year. I would highly recommend Water for Elephants!
4,I enjoyed this novel,"The narrator is a 90-something year old man remembering a certain key period in his life when he was part of a traveling circus. The characters were interesting and Rosie the elephant, in particular, took my heart. Included in the book are actual photos of old-time circus folk--from a ""hootchie-cootchie"" girl, posing without shame and looking directly at the camera, to an entertainer posing with her elephant, who appears to be smiling! The photos are poignant and are a big plus to a very readable book."
4,Best book in a while,"While not particularly deep, this book covers a lot of territory and fills in a lot of background to what has been my sketchy knowledge of circus life. I'm not really interested in circuses, but this was an interesting book and gave yet another dimension to my understanding of the Great Depression. Some of the minor characters take on real depth, including Walter, some of the general circus laborers, and, of course, Rosie. And it really purges the emotions and releases a lot of pent up anger in a hilarious and horrible act of vengence.This is a good and well-told story."
2,Surprised,I was surprised at how much I did not enjoy this book. I had heard so much hype about it. I felt like the book took a long time to get going and some of the scenes were odd and wrongly placed within the storyline.
2,Average,"There was a lot of hype for this book, which is why I decided to pick it up. It was easy to get through, but I was only looking to get through it. I did not really enjoy it. I felt that the middle 200 pages could be ripped out and the story would be the same. I can appreciate the character development for August and (the older) main character. However, I was not impressed with the book overall. It was very anti-climatic."
2,I don't get it...,I was looking forward to reading this book but I was disappointed. The foul language and incredibly graphic sex scenes were appalling to me. The only part I liked was the flash backs to the old man.
4,Does it have to be a masterpiece?,"I understand some of the criticism, but does a book have to be a literary masterpiece to be immensely enjoyable? The overwhelming positive reviews explain why not.It is well researched, but maybe the plot stretched a bit too far at times and low quality dialogues have taken away from the book's otherwise star quality.The depression era was well represented, gave a good realistic feel of the troubled times and the people. Circus setting was pure genius, and made it so interesting.Overall, it is a very enjoyable book, very readable."
4,cood condition/great book,The book arrived in very good condition for the price I paid. It's a great book that we used for our book club last month. Easy enough for all levels to read but intriguing enough to be discussed!
4,Fun read,"Fun and quick book. Found some of the details predictable, but over all a book I would recommend. Best for a high school/ college crowd."
3,Interesting in parts; boring in other places,"Life in the circus during the Depression is probably depicted very accurately; times were hard and people were desperate. The circus setting for the book is excellent; but, in my opinion, the plot is somewhat weak and the ending was less than I had hoped for.As others have described the scenes vary from life in a nursing home to Jacob's past life in the circus. I actually liked that juxtapostion and felt it was done well. I loved the pictures in the book and felt they added a lot. In short, not a bad read, just not as gripping as I had hoped it would be."
4,"Very entertaining, a fast read!","This book was easy to read and very interesting. It had a circus-like atmosphere in it's storytelling and enlightened me to that world.I recommend it for those who are looking for fun entertainment with interesting, different characters."
5,AMAZING!,I could not set this book down. It was graphic and the best way I can describe it is 'disturbingly intriguing.' a must read!
3,"Good book, not a good ending...","I liked the book although a bit depressing and if you are an animal lover some of the references to how the animals in the circus are treated can make you a bit uncomfortable. What I didn't like was the ending - it ended quickly and on this high note that seemed forced (don't want to spoil anything for anyone but I was expecting the end to be a bit more ""realistic"" not ""feel good movie"" ending...)"
4,Water for Elephants,An enjoyable read. The background of the circus did not deflect from relating to the clients. Seeing the past through the eyes of the 93 year old protagonist was wonderful.
4,great getaway read,sara gruen brought you to circus life instantly . also to the life of a nursing home .great twists and turns
1,Such a Disappointment!,"I actually made it through this book to the end despite all its faults. I'm astonished at how much positive hype this book has received. I might give it 2 stars for the compelling concept, if it had not received so many unwarranted 5 star reviews. The dialogue is cute to the point of trite, character depth and development is cardboard thin at best and placement of the book believably in its time and place is virtually non-existent. In an interview at the back of the book the author mentions being a technical writer for tech firms. This is clear in the brittle, if well intentioned characters."
1,Cheap Thrill,"Disappointing. Not more than a cheap ""dime novel"", as we used to call them. Every other chapter included some sort of a cheap, sordid event that, like provocative movies, really weren't necessary and only lowered the quality of the book."
2,No thanks,"I'd rather not try to pick thru profanity to get to a story.If it wasn't so vulgar, it might have been a good book."
1,Don't do it,"This is one of the worst books I've read. It has a lot of attention grabbing fodder but no backbone. I did read all the way though, only to find out how it ended. If you like sensationalized nonsense, here's your book!"
2,Meh,"Fortunately, I didn't pay full price for this book; I borrowed it on my Kindle through my Prime membership.The author found some interesting true circus stories but wove them together poorly. The book read like a treatment for a screenplay, in that it seemed less like a novel than an attempt to sell a script to Hollywood. The characters all sounded the same, and the dialogue was too modern for the time period of the novel. I have not seen the movie, but I think it would at least be visually interesting to distract from the plot. The love story is barely believable and the villains are archetypes--you've seen them before.Not very deep, but the animals are interesting. Much more so than the people."
3,Not what I expected,"I had heard so much talk about this book but I wasn't that impressed or intrigued. It gave me a glimpse into how hard a life the circus folks had and gave me the feeling it was the place you ended up when you had no place else to go. Definitely took the glamour out of my fascination with circus'. I am glad I read it, it wasn't a waste of time but it just wasn't as good as I expected."
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"This has to be one of the most boring books I've ever read except for the nursing home scenes when Jacob is older. I got a kick out of the humor during those nursing home moments of the book, but the rest is boring. There are too many characters and very little character development. I'm glad I didn't pay for this book as it was free for Prime members via the Kindle library."
1,Shockingly terrible,"I've read bad books before but never, until now, felt it my duty to post a negative review of one. This is without a doubt the worst book I ever suffered through in my life: awkward, amateurish writing, one dimensional characters, simplistic moronic storyline as bad as the worst made-for-tv movie. Without telling her my opinion, I handed this book to my wife and asked her to open to any page and read just that page and give me her impression. She said, ""It reads like a 12 year old's first draft.""I will never again be fooled by ""New York Times Best Seller"" written across the top of the front cover of any book again."
1,don't recommend it,"boring! can't understand why so many people enjoyed reading this book, I read 1/3 of it, and just couldn't make myself to read any longer."
1,Terrible. Just terrible.,"I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book. It's a very cliche story written in nothing but cliche phrases. I later found out that the author, Sara Gruen, wrote this book for NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month). The purpose of NaNoWriMo is to write a novel in a month without editing---without caring how terrible it is. I have no doubt that Gruen went back and edited the book, but despite her best efforts the novel still sucks. This book was a giant waste of my time."
1,Pathetic.,I am in agreement with all of the other one-star reviews here. Totally unbelievable characters. The author fails miserably at trying to conjure up the voice of a 90 (or 93) year old male. Every character sounds the same and the reader can never gain any emotional attachment to any of them. If I had to read about streaks of moonlight or sunlight entering through the slats one more time I would have murdered someone. Truly one dimensional writing. The best thing about this book is that I read it on the Kindle and only had to hit the DELETE key to get it out of my life for eternity.
1,Such Poor Writing,"i totally don't understand why so many people loved this book. i earnestly tried to read it the whole way through but couldn't. the main character is completely unbelievable, and the dialogue is terrible (i find it hard to believe people spoke that way in the year this novel took place). the prose in this book had zero imagination. when i read books like this, i feel like the author is more interested in finishing than developing the work.the litany of things i hated about this book would take all day to write. i suppose if you were ever interested in read this tripe, go for it, as it seems like tons of people loved it. i hated Water for Elephants, however."
1,"Predictable, boring, and unnecessarily pornographic","I truly do not understand all the love this book is getting. The writing was stale and cliche. Nothing was actually believable as plausible. I did not find anything about this book exceptional or worthy of praise. The parts I hated most were the explicit and extremely overly detailed sex/sexual scenes. They added nothing to the story and really turned me off to the book and author. If the movie contains all the details of the book, it would have to be marketed as a porno. Even if those parts had been left out, or at least left something to the imagination, I still would not have thought it a particularly excellent book."
4,Entertaining historical details,It's all in the details and the people who become real. I liked how the author used past and present to age Jacob. It added depth to a story which was already full of twists and turns.
1,"Profane, Graphic and Vulgar",I would have given this book no stars but that is not an option.This book is horrendous. I cannot imagine anyone with a lick of intelligence actually enjoying this trash. I threw it away after 25 pages.
1,too filthy to read,"The author seems to have put forth every effort into including as much filth as possible in this book. I read 6 chapters, thinking that surely the author would run out of filth and would get on with the story. I gave up! This is absolutely the worst book I've ever tried to read! I quit trying after the 6 chapters and had the book deleted from my kindle and from my account. This book was given good ratings by so many that I kept thinking the story would eventually override the filth; it didn't. I wish I had given up on it much sooner; I feel like a garbage truck dumped its load into my mind. One would think that the author would be embarrassed to have folks know that her mind contains so much filth."
2,Overrated,"I failed to discover what all the hype was about. So, life in the circus is actually (or was sleezy). The story dragged and left me not wanting to take my children to the circus ever again."
4,Good reading.,Good book. I've located others written by S. Gruen since. I especially enjoyed the main character's thoughts upon being in a senior care facility.
5,Amazing!,Way better than I had anticipated! Great story line awesome characters. Now I can finally move on to the movie!:)
5,Great book,This book was a great read. Better than the movie and I would read again. Great story line also.AmazonWould recommend to friends!
5,Great read!,"This book took me three days to read... couldn't put it down! The descriptions made it easy to visualize what was going on. I also love how the author took real-life situations and managed to put them together in a way that flowed throughout the book. I have not seen the movie, but after reading this book, I just might have to!"
2,Not Getting the Hype,"I honestly don't understand all the hype surrounding this book. I bought this as the first purchase on my Kindle, because I'd hoped that it would be one of those books you just *have* to read in one sitting. Not so with this one - the whole time I kept waiting for the plots, characters, and relationships to get better and more engaging, but it never did (not for me, at least). I got to the end and thought, ""oh.. that's it?"" I particularly thought the development of the ""love story"" aspect was unsatisfying - just why is Jacob so obsessed with Marlena, other than his attraction towards her? You never really see their relationship blossom to the point where his love and devotion towards her are justified. In fact, I didn't even really care whether or not they would end up with one another at the end. I was probably most concerned with the fates of Kinko/Walter and the elephant."
2,"Great History and Concept, poor writing","Good concept in terms of time, place and description of depression era circus life. Writing is passable, but observations on human character are WEAK. I regret reading this and should have just gone to the movie."
2,Disappointment,"I know several people who have read this and loved it. I just could not get into it. It is a good story, but that is about it. I expected a lot more depth to the story based on all of the hype is was receiving. I was very disappointed in the end. It is not something I would recommend to others."
4,Great Read - Heart-Breaking at Times,"Ninety-three year old Jacob Jankowski, now living in a nursing home, reminisces about the summer of 1931 which he spent with the Benzini Brothers circus. The inner workings, relationships, conflicts of circus life are so well described in this novel with such interesting detail, you really feel like you are there. Following the events of Jacob's life made me laugh and cry. I really loved this book and am looking forward to seeing the soon-to-be-released movie."
5,Great story,"Loved the book! Good story about a reflection of a life time. Characters are real. It is an excellent protrayal of the post depression era and the life of the traveling circus. The book has romance, heart break, tragedies and suspense. Definitely worth reading. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend it!"
5,Water for elephants,This book caught my interest and kept it every step of the way. I'm curious about the movie.Great book.
3,GOOD ENTERTAINMENT,"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS gives the reader an insight to the innards of the early circuses, It is well written. I preferred the movie."
3,Home use ONLY,We tried to listen to it in the car. BUT our car was too noisey. So we had to listen to it at home. The voice could be clearer.
4,A very sad book...............,"I read this book from cover to cover, and I'm glad I did. But I thought it was very sad, because of the old man in the nursing home narrating the book, because of the animal abuse to the elephant and other species, and because of the spousal abuse to the elephant rider. Oh, there were elements of humor, friendship, love, and happiness. The ending was good as well as unexpected. Still, if I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be ""sad."""
5,Sure to be a Selection of Bookclubs Everywhere!,"The Benzini Brothers were a third rate circus during the bottom of the Great Depression. As 90 year old Jacob now remembers it, the circus transformed the life of Marlena and himself through the power of love and trust in this heartrending story of freaks, clowns, pain and passion. Sure to be a selection for bookclubs everywhere"
4,I ran away to join the circus for a few hours....,"This is a well-written, cute story. I certainly achieved the `suspension of disbelief' that one looks for in a summer novel. I empathized with the main character, and could picture him and the others. I feel like I know Jacob Jankowski - both the younger version in shock from losing his parents, and the older version who hates being treated like an ""invalid"". Unlike some reviewers, I am not old enough to remember the circus coming to town on the train and with a parade. In fact, the circus experience from my childhood was in a large concert venue. Nevertheless, Gruen allows me to imagine the big top in all of its grimy glory and picture all of the alcohol loving workers and performers smuggling their drinks on the train. What a nice escape."
5,great old fashion story telling,"No gimmicks or come ons for the ""a sucker born every minute"" crowd, this was story telling at its finist. You see a current life(nursing home) and the past life( the circus) through the eyes of the main character looking at both with great insight and a humor that comes from a life lived with a philosopy of love of animals and ideals of what is right. It is perhaps the best internal/external discription of being 90/93 (the character isn't sure)that I have ever read. I heard this on audio book and it was like going to a play. If you liked some of the classics like Grapes of Wrath or The Trees you should love this first hand story telling."
3,Water for Elephants,"An excellently written and very interesting story which actually does have an unexpected ending!However, there is a great deal of violence, sexual violence and sadistic behavior in general.I wish that this excellent writer could write a book for adults which wouldn't call for reading so much trashy stuff. I'm a great believer in ""garbage in, garbage out"" and wish that my recollectons of this otherwise terrific book didn't include the above trash, and/or large sections which I skipped just because I didn't want to put such stuff into my poor brain to remember! This was such a wonderful story that I feel badly that I find it necessary to warn about the trashy side of it."
2,Water from Elephants,"Combine research into the American train circus, a prose style that is about as sophisticated and threatening as Velveeta cheese, utterly one-dimensional characters, and a storyline that does move steadily along, and what do you get? A best-seller."
3,Not Quite Sure HOW to Rate this Book,"I am not quite sure how to rate this book. It was a book club pick or I probably would not have read it. I picked it up and put it down countless times before I could actually finish it. I just could not get past the animal cruelty scenes. Plus I am probably one of a minority of people that do not believe animals are here for our entertainment. The fact that they were and still are, I am sure, in many third rate circuses/traveling zoos mistreated makes it all the more heartbreaking for me. I had to give the book stars for the scenes involving Jacob in his old age and also for making you care about the characters. I cried over Walter's fate. The author also took pity on me and at least made me think some of the animals received a better fate and future. I keeping thinking about Rex though..........."
3,boring,I bought this book because it has a nice cover and it did not live up to the pretty picture. It was pretty boring. I've seen many people reading it on the train and don't really understand why it got so popular. I guess everyone judged it by the cover like I did.
2,Over rated book...,I was looking for a good read and after seeing the high marks this book received I thought I couldn't go wrong. I put it down halfway thru and only picked it back up because I paid for it. I read alot and I just don't get the extreme praise this book racked up.
3,"Good book, but light","I enjoyed this book, but I thought it was light on plot and character development. I purchased it based on the numerous 5-star ratings that it received from Amazon readers. I expected it to be more - did not dislike it, but wouldn't recommend it to reader's who want more from a book."
3,Well...it was ok,"I'm a bit confused by all of the 5 star reviews. This was mildly entertaining storytelling at best. I wasn't overly fond of any of the characters, just didn't really care what happened to any of them."
2,yawn,"I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, but I found myself skimming through parts in the middle. Not sure if I understand all the fuss."
3,Interesting,"It took me a while to get into this book, past the honest, gritty description of circus life in the 30s. After I got used to that, I ended up loving the main characters and the story."
5,Excellent read,"At first I was skeptical about reading a book about a circus, but everyone I know that has read the book had given it great reviews. I'm glad to say I was not disappointed. The author did a great job with this book and detailing the era in which it is written. I bought this book on my Kindle and can honestly say I could not put it down - the convenience of having my Kindle books available through apps on my cell phone / computer and the actual Kindle made it even harder to put down and all the more exciting to read. I highly recommend this book, it did not disappoint in any way!"
5,very enticing fast-paced read!,I thought that this book was excellent. I loved the way that Jacob was portrayed in his older years and I loved how Gruen flashed back and forth from past to present. Made the book hard to put down. I am a very hard to please reader but this book really hit the nail on the head. Would recommend to anyone who's up for a new look into circus life!
5,My Opinion?,This book had me on the balls of my feet the whole time I was reading. I cried when Jacob cried. I laughed when Rosie smiled. I loved every second I was with Jacob and Marlena and Camel and Walter. This book is relatable on many levels. On the level of a child this book brings out the excitement and curiosity of circus day. On the level of a young adult this book brings out a rebellious side. On the level of an elderly person this book brings out the joy of being young. What a person was like in earlier days and what they are still like in the present day. Anyone can read this book and emerge from the pages feeling satisfied and revived.
5,Sorry to see it end!,"This is one of the best novels I've read in a very long time. The story and the characters draw you in, and it becomes increasingly difficult to put this book down. I always get a sad feeling when I come to the end of a really good book, because the characters be one so familiar; thus was the case with this book."
4,A Memorable Read,"Water for Elephants is well written, you always want to know where the author is going next. She describes human feelings in such a way that the reader discovers them from the words, and experiences them with the character. It's very real life and thus sometimes sad and depressing, but always looking toward the future. If you love animals you will feel both hurt and joy and if you are getting ""older"" you will identify with the main character's journey and final success."
2,OK,I found this to be predictable and the character relationships lacking in substance and development. The story is one that is entertaining and the circus aspect is not something I read about every day; that's basically the only reason I finished it.
3,Check it out,"Pretty good book. It's faaun, interesting, full of adventure, captivating. The ending though...well, the reader always thinks he knows best!"
3,Water for elephants,I loved this bookIt was the best book I've read in awhileI give this book to thumbs up
4,Wow,Awesome really good book way better then the movie can even explained in word what I thought of it sooo good
3,Surprisingly well done,"I have been disappointed by popular fiction, especially when there is a movie, but not this time. Although I would not recommend it for young readers,the story is believable and enthralling. The writing if full of quotable prose,and I loved the accuracy of the descriptions of the elder Jacob."
1,I want my money back!,"This book came highly recommended. As I read the book, I wanted to enjoy it. I was trying to like it. I could not. I never write reviews but I just can't believe how many readers/reviewers loved this books. I hated it! The characters are shallow and boring. The writing was aweful, almost childish. The only time I was partly enjoying reading this book was during Jacob's elderly years. I could not understand what the author's point was in pointing out (several times) that August was Jewish? It had nothing to do with anything in the book and yet the only character whose religion was discussed (besides the main character) was one who was Jewish and who also happened to be the book's only villain. No one's religion had anything to do with the circus. I am so disappointed. I have read many, many books. I have to say, this is definitely one of the worst ones. And, unless you are a big circus fan, the most boring book as well!"
1,Not a fulfilling read,"I'm glad that this book is getting people to read but it just did not captivate my imagination at all. Any people craving a good read about a ""carnival-esque"" atmosphere should start with ""Geek Love"". This book was boring, the characters amateur and annoying, and the story lacked plausibility."
2,A disappointment...,"I bought this book based mostly on its excellent reader reviews. I also figured the circus as a story setting would be fascinating. I had previously read a novel based on circus characters that was incredible. Unfortunately, I didn't see what all the fuss was about in this case. In fact, this was one of the few books in recent memory I had to put down halfway through because I found the plot dull and plodding, the characters flat and lifeless. The writing itself good but lacked the sparkle to overcome those flaws."
1,tedious,"Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die. That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more."
1,Sexual Content and language,"I really wanted to read this book because of the movie coming out but the sexual content of this book is outrageous! Don't read if you can't watch a ""R"" rated movie. It's one thing to ""ignore"" these things in a movie but to have to read them and find where they aren't in the book is horrible! Makes the whole book unreadable."
5,Great,Great book. Better than I expected. I'm glad I read the book before I saw the movie. Can't wait to see it
5,"Water for Elephants ,","It is an excellent read .You get involved with the characters ,feeling their frustration with the times ,The Great Depression,don't know what was great about it .But the book is an enjoyable read,you can become one with the characters.Relive a part of the history of this country & the circus,not all good & not all bad, you will enjoy this book ,laugh a little & cry a little,feel friendships loss & gain.Most times I didn't want to put it down ,Sarah Gruen is an excellent author. Enjoy"
2,"Decent premise, uninspired prose","Full disclosure: I read 'East of Eden' just prior to this book and after luxuriating in Steinbeck's prose for the last few weeks, the comparison seems almost unfair. 'Water for Elephants' has a novel premise but the execution left me cold. Gruen's prose is expository and workmanlike, and lacks the artistry of the great authors. Obviously she's found her audience - and I did enjoy the story so I can't complain too loudly - but with so many truly great, well-crafted pieces of fiction out there, why waste your time? Life is short. Try some other contemporary authors instead, like Jonathan Safran Foer, Khaled Hosseini or Nicole Krauss... or Steinbeck, for that matter ;-)"
1,Slop,"Sara Gruen seems like a nice person. But this novel is total dreck. The structure reeks of baloney, the ""different"" characters are written with the same bland voice, and the whole melodramatic mess never rises above laughable soap operatics. I'd never want to take enjoyment of this kind of thing away from anyone, but if you've not read it, I'm sure there are better books about the circus out there for you."
2,Nice research...,"I'm not picky about my books, really! I read airport books! I read mystery novels! But about half-way through, Water for Elephant's 2-dimensional, unrealistic characters' bad soap opera conversations became too tedious and repetitious. I slogged through, anyway. I was waiting for more elephant plot. But no- Ms. Gruen got even lazier at the end. Anything and anyone that might have been considered a loose end gets killed off without regret. ""Mr. Major Character W? We threw him off the train 30 minutes ago. Probably(!!) died. Don't worry about it.""I was disappointed."
2,Depressing,DON'T read this book if you're a sensitive soul with a love for animals. You'll likely find it very depressing.
1,Disappointed and Disgusted,"I bought this book because it was rated so highly and it was a NaNoWriMo novel. Somehow I made it to the bit that describes the old man having a shower which is about a 1/3 the way through according to my Kindle progress bar. I don't know how. I found it so incredibly vulgar that I just couldn't keep going. I didn't even care enough about the characters or the story to skip to the last few pages to find out what happened. In fact, I wish I could erase what I did read from my head and gain back the time I wasted reading it."
1,animals,"Simply stated, I threw the book across the room when the elephant was hurt...one of many cruel things done to animals in the book. As hard as I tried, I could not find anything interesting in the book. Scattered and full of unbelievable misery."
1,CAUTION - PORN PARTS!!!,I really wish publishers would rate books like they do movies. I got to the porn part and once again threw another book in the trash unfinished. Problem is these books are good and the authors don't need to put the trashy parts in - they choose to. Garbage in - Garbage out. Guard your heart and your mind don't buy this book. Buy something else or wait for the PG version.
1,Oh Please!,I couldn't read this book all the way through. Using GD all the time and the main character lusting after a married women. YUCK!
1,Terrible -- Didn't even finish,"I had heard this was a good book. I was misinformed. This was the most crude, foul book I have ever attempted to read. Though the main story was mildly interesting, the all too frequent use of profanity and descriptions of intimate relations put me off entirely. I started trying to use white out to cover the offensive items. I quickly realized that would include a great deal of the book. I decided I didn't want to fill my mind with such things and stopped reading. This book went directly into the recycle bin rather than being donated to a thrift store. I didn't want another unwitting person to go through the same experience I did."
3,I liked the movie better,"I am so tired of first person narratives, so maybe my complaint about his book isn't objective. All the ""I, I, I, I,"" really got on my nerves. The movie was so much better because I didn't have to read the word, ""I"" anymore. The book also contains a lot of offensive language, which didn't seem to fit the era. The story line was interesting and moved along at a nice pace."
3,Good story,"The story was great. Really interesting and easy to read. The ending was lacking I felt - an old man running away from the nursing home, not so exciting."
3,Slow,This is my first e book. I havE BAD EYES SO IT TOOK ME QUIET AWHILE. IT WAS SLOW READING FOR ME.
2,Ok,Some things had great description while others were a glancing thought. The ending was a bit hasty but enjoyed the old man's humor.
5,Fantastically Entertaining!,Great novel! Lots of great research went into this book. This book had me hooked from the start.
2,Too boring to finish,"I am listening to this book on CD as I write this, and am rereading all the recommendations and aclaim, trying to figure out what I was missing. I don't like this book. It's predictable and boring. I did not enjoy the graphic sexual descriptions or the vivid details of vomit, rotten entrails and pooh, which I am not usually squeemish about, but it really is too much, it doesn't add a lot to the story. Lots of description, not much content. I just could not get into it."
2,A fun summer read,"This book was highly recommended to me by women in an assisted living facility where I teach, for whom one of the book themes--aging and loss of autonomy--resonated deeply. I found it an engaging read, though the story almost caves in under the weight of the author's research. The characters are archetypes I had the feeling I'd seen somewhere before, lacking complexity, and it was ultimately difficult to care about any of them. The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile."
4,"Interesting story, beautifully written","This beautifully written novel opens with Jacob, age 93 or 90 - he doesn't remember which. The book flashes back and forth from Jacob's present life in an old-age home to his young adult life caring for animals in a traveling circus. Though a bit over the top, this story is so marvelously told that I found myself turning page after page savoring the prose."
4,Water for elephants,"An amazingly thoughtful, well written book. A great story of circuses and circus life........loved it. A must read for all."
4,Slow moving to start,"Good book, pleasant read with some sad parts. I would read it again. The life of a cut circus performer\worker is pretty entertaining."
3,Entertaining but not Artful,"This book is like a typical big-studio Hollywood movie: predictable and people-pleasing, but not very nuanced or sophisticated. The first section of the book is the best, with its vivid and grim descriptions of circus life in the depression era. Once the plotline takes over, though, it becomes canned and corny. Gruen's prose is serviceable at best. I won't likely be reading her again."
4,Interesting and well-researched.,"This was a tremendously fun and interesting read... not to mention educational too. The whole travelling circus/sideshow thing has always fascinated me, so it was interesting to find a novel with that as it's backdrop. The characters felt very real and I found myself reading far past my bedtime because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The only dissapointing part of the book to me was at the very end. I can see how some people like things to be tied up in a nice little bow, but to me it was so implausable that it almost ruined the whole reading experience."
4,One Circus You Son't Want To Miss,"Sara Gruen's Water For Elephants is narrated by a feisty 93-year-old man who wants one more taste of the circus before he dies. His life story with the Benzini Brothers unfolds throughout the book, from his experiences in the circus to the love affair that will alter the course of his life.The book is without a doubt a fantastic read... if you like circuses. Even if modern history doesn't interst you too much and you prefer, like me, ancient history, you'll want to give this one a try.Highly recommended!"
3,Good but not deserving of 4 or 5 stars,"The historical story was interesting and kept my attention, even though I think TOO MANY people here are giving Ms. Gruen too much credit. Personally, I don't think she used enough historical fact and instead relied on a very formulaic plot-line that was very predictable, i.e. the love relationship, the MC and head of the animals will be foiled in the end, and the preposterous ending where our dear wonderful elephant kills the cruel animal director. Too contrived for me.I can understand the popularity of this book. I cannot understand why it's a runaway bestseller."
3,Ok...Not the Best...Not the Worst,"An interesting way to showcase circus history & a way of life that is no more.Although this is a fictionalized account, it was based on bits & pieces of fact from Circus History.The photographs were the best.They were a nice addition to the book.The nursing home drama/tie-in was a bit too much.I guess it was a play on the theme of running away to join the circus...Just never heard of someone who ran away from a nursing home in a wheel chair to join the circus & was successful with it!"
4,Loved it...until the end,"The title of my review pretty much says it all. This was a very easy, enjoyable read full of characters you can't help but love - and love to hate. There were some inconsistencies in details, but most of them would sail right past the average person and weren't a big deal to me.It is almost always hard for me to initially get into a book, I don't know why, but it is. This book was different, it had my rapt attention from start to finish - though the end was disappointing to me. After chapters of such a great story, I found the almost ridiculous improbability of the ending to be quite out of place. I also could have happily lived without the animal abuse and the unnecessary deaths of Walter & Camel, but the ending sat particularly poorly with me. In addition, the final chapter seemed to bring the previously well paced story to a very abrupt halt that felt all wrong. I enjoyed the rest of the book, however, and feel it's well worth the read."
4,Loved it,Great read. Amazing characters! Very descriptive and so easy to get pulled in. I can't wait to see the movie
3,"Good, not great","Quick paced, but writing style is so simplistic a middle school student could read this (sans the sex scenes). Yes, it was a quick read, but predictable. The circus setting was a new twist, and somewhat interesting, but the characters were almost sterotypes of themselves. I don't understand what the hoopla is about for this book."
4,Great summer read,"A co-worker recommend this book to me and I found myself finished within a couple days. One can really feel part of the story. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I found some of the story predictable and when I finished, the story didn't linger with me"
1,Depictions of animal abuse and slaughter spoil an otherwise good read,"Although the story of Jacob at 93 and 23 was interesting, and the scenes in the nursing home were both touching and humorous, the issues with the animals were so realistic and disturbing that by the time Rosie the elephant was introduced into the book, I had to stop reading. This is without a doubt written by a talented author, and if he could write about another subject that did not involve animal abuse and slaughter, I would give it a try."
3,Just OK,"Too graphic for kids, too infantile for adults...this was just an OK book. I read it because several people recommended it for our book club at work. Many of the characters were so badly drawn and one-dimensional that I lost interest mid-story. The August character in particular was the worst creation: he's a ripoff of Nathan from William Styron's ""Sophie's Choice."" Marlena is just sequined cardboard. I enjoyed the setting because there's something fascinating about circuses, or else I would have rated this lower than 3 stars. For a book supposedly about people who care about animals, it doesn't have touching moments or much emotion. Vastly overrrated novel."
2,"Started strong, became predictable, totally unrealistic ending...","I had high hopes for this book. I wasn't expecting great literature, but at least an exciting and original read. It started in a promising way and I liked the circus setting. The juxtaposition of old and young versions of the same narrator was interesting. But, about 1/4 of the way in, the story bogged down in shopworn plot devices. I thought I stumbled on the circus version of Sophie's Choice!The ending was entirely pat and unbelievable. As a reader, I was actually insulted by the she wrapped things up."
4,Great read!,"Read this book as it was listed by my mother in law as one of her favorite books. It is charming and witty, and even though centered around the circus shows depth in what life is about at all ages! Worth reading! Love the character's personality too!!"
4,A unique read,"This book was amazing. The pace is almost like the circus train itself: it starts chugging forward slowly and then before you know it, you're flying so fast you can barely keep your balance! Gruen's writing is so evocative -- you feel like you are on that train and in those tents. You taste the food, smell the smells, hear the sounds, feel the animals and the movement of the train. It's amazing that she could write so vividly about an era in history with which she had no prior knowledge before writing the book.The only thing I didn't like about it were the scenes involving animal cruelty. I knew they would be there, given the subject matter, but it was still difficult. However, I give Gruen credit for not making them gratuitous. They were important to developing the story line and the characters.All in all, a great ride!"
4,"Enjoyable, entertaining",It is obvious the author had done a great deal of research. The result is an enlightening and entertaining novel.
4,Great book!,"This book is a great read. Very enjoyable to learn about circus life. The author did a lot of research about the circus so it makes the story very real. I couldn't help but cringe sometimes with the story of the animals, but there is always a dark side to everything. Highly recommend it. An overall great book."
3,A good read,"I enjoyed the ending of the book the most. It started out a little slow in my opinion (first 200 pages) but the ending made it worth it. It wasn't one of my all time favorites, but it is a good book to read at least once. It was also well written and researched."
5,Water for Elephants----MUST READ!!!,"I just finished Water for Elephants and could not put it down. I won't tell you why, but please read the prologue at the beginning of the book prior to starting the book.It was such a beautiful story. It was a subject that I never thought I would interested in but boy was I wrong! Read it...you will love it no matter what age you are!"
5,Water for Elephants,This novel was absolutely fabulous. I liked the way the author bounced back and forth from the past to the present. I could really feel the many struggles the characters were having by the way the author got into their minds. Terrific story with interesting photos to make it so real.
4,great book!,"Water for elephants is a great book! i wasn't so sure at the beginning, but I'm glad i stuck with it. definitely recommend to readers looking for a thriller."
2,Really?,"I endured this inartful, trite novel from beginning to end and I'm baffled by its popularity. Even as a peek into a fringe society it lacks any surprises. Frustratingly boring."
2,Horrifying Animal Cruelty,"ANIMAL LOVERS BEWARE! This book contains horrifying and graphic descriptions of animal cruelty. Sure, the protagonist loves animals and is appalled by it, but I found the many passages with violence against animals (and people) so disturbing that I didn't enjoy the book. Read it at your own risk."
3,Interesting but lacking charachter development,"I enjoyed learning about the life of a circus performer in the Great Depression, however I was very disappointed in the Authors inability to expand upon the main characters (narrators) relationship / love for the animals. This seemed to be only an aferthought on many occassions. I thought the author did a wonderful job switching back and forth between past and present, and did true justice to how we often treat our elders today. Even lacking character / relationship development, it is still a good read."
1,Haven't read yet...,I was told the movie was good so before i watch the movie I'm going read the book. Lucky me.
4,...never to be forgotten,An enjoyable three ring circus! With many acts and clowns (both more ways than one.) The reader participated... in sights and sounds! This multi-layered book was a high flying wire show! Bravo!
3,What water?,"Sorry, but this book didn't keep me interested. I finished it, but only because I'm a little OCD. It didn't ""put me"" back there at a circus at all. And, where does the water come in?"
4,Enjoyable read,"This is a light and whimsical tale of a man, a woman, and a circus. I love learning about the circus culture in the 1940s."
4,good'n,"Water for elephants is happy, sad, romantic, and exciting ,it changes from page to page. Just as something exciting happens it switches to Jacob struggling as an old man in a nursing home. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises. The book is a very detailed description of a disgusting circus in the 1930's from the illegal moonshine to straining horse trough water through a pair of clowns panty hose to make lemonade, and the red lighting (when they are thrown off of the train over a tressle) of unwanted employees. Although the main character has some difficulty, you know it will be ok in the end because he tells it as an old man in a nursing home. During his time in the circus Jacob makes some very interesting friends, like Walter the midget clown, Earl the gentle security guard ,and Uncle Al who is way more of a jerk than he seems. Overall the book was a very exciting story about Jacob trying to survive in a circus and getting the woman he loves."
4,Great Read,I really enjoyed this book. I usually like to read a book vs seeing the movie. The book is usually way better. This was a pretty good book. Loved the elephant. She was very smart in the end.
5,Never read a book so fast!,"Absolutly wonderful! Its going to be hard to top this one any time soon! I experienced every kind of emotion with this book! I love books like this! I laughed, cried, hated, and loved! There were times when I had anxiety while reading and times I wanted to jump into the book and hug some of the characters! Rosemary was one of my favoties in the book! But, now that I think of it...it would be impossible to pick a favorite! After reading the book, I asked my husband if we could get an elephant! (haha) I have also been passing out this book like hotcakes!"
4,Different and good!,Totally different than what I normally read and I am very glad I did. Worth picking up for sure!
5,Intense and Gritty at times...but thoroughly Wonderful.,"If you are looking for a warm fuzzy kind of read this is not it. I enjoyed this book more than any I've read in a very long time. It is written from an Autobiographical viewpoint. The historical correctness of depression era life, trains and circuses show great attention to detail and research. I have very brief periods of time available to read. It was so hard to put this one down. I found myself popping the Kindle open just to squeeze in a paragraph.The book is so well written that this reader becames engrossed in the story. The violent or graphic parts of the story felt very real. It was and intense, gritty, incredible read."
4,A rich story,A superb book with excellent writing and rich characters.It really takes a good look at the life of a performer.
4,Surprising!,I had no desire whatsoever to read this book until I saw a trailer for the movie. The tailer caught my eye and since books are always better then the movie I took a chance and found that I thought it was a great story. The story felt real. It's a very believeable read and I liked that it wasn't sugar coated. It held my interest and taught me a lot about circus life in that time period. The ending completely caught me off guard. Water for Elephants is a story that will stay with me forever. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading!
4,Loved it.,"I wish it were longer, I would have kept reading. I thought it was a great book. Now I need to rent the movie."
4,Not at all what I expected,This book was not at all what I was expecting. The for shadowing was a little confusing at first but I soon figured it out and really enjoyed the old and young version of the narrative.
5,Excellent read!,"We just read this book for our book club and it was overwhelmingly loved by all. The author does an excellent job of teaching the reader about the ""other side"" of the circuses of yesterday as well as treats the pitfalls of aging very poignantly."
3,"a good read for the beach, but not for your brain cells....","Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for. A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey). I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one. Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything. I prefer a bit more of a challenge."
2,overated cardboard pap,"Just because someone can do research, tell a story and organize one's thoughts doesn't mean an author has anything to say. The characters in this book are cardboard , one dimesional and lack any depth . They are carefully draw heroes and villians. There is no depth to any of them and Jacob's reflections, an old man looking back on his youthful time in the circus, do not ring true. Much of the writing is tedious and uninspired. To read a REALLY good book about love and an old man's reflections try , A History of Love by Nicloe Krauss. Water for Elephant is highly over rated and the language is dull."
2,Definitely did not love it,"This book was easy reading, but was also kind of facile and read like a treatment for a movie script (and I am sure there will be a movie). I think we were supposed to find crotchety old Jacob lovably cantankerous, but I just thought he was annoying. The circus story (featuring young Jacob) was much better, but all it has is plot--characters don't really develop, writing is passable but not skilled."
1,Disappointing,"As a devoted historical fiction reader, I thought this book would interest me. It did not. Water for Elephants reads like a children's novel, save for excessive and serious profanity, graphic and frequent sex scenes, and violence so vivid I was moved to nausea. If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The characters do not develop over the course of the story, and seem only concerned with dabbling in vice. As a result, I was unable to identify with them.A portion of the story is written from the point of view of the main character in his old age. This writing is exceptional, and managed to keep me interested during the course of the book. Still, these marvelous little glimpses of author Sara Gruen's potential do not permit me to recommend this book to anybody. Avoid it."
5,Best book I've ever read!!,"This book draws you in from the first line and doesn't let you go until the last page. Perfect, perfect, perfect!! This is my favorite book and is the BEST book I have ever read!"
4,Water for Elephants:A Novel,"A fast paced, heart-warming story that keeps your attention. I will read more of Sara Gruen's books after reading this one."
3,It was average.,"It was a decent book; however, it was not really my thing. I prefer more historical detail/facts to a story. There are too many great books out there for me to say I would recommend it. I wouldn't. I would watch the movie, if they release it."
4,Not as good as I thought it would be,"With all the ""hype"" about this book, I was expecting more-more plot,and a more interesting main character. And really it reads like a script. So often the author does too much explaining about how each character is sitting, their reaction,etc. as if in preparation for a movie,with too much explaining how the actors should perform.I do like the depression era and the circus theme , which drew me to the book.I am looking forward to seeing the movie but mostly because of the actors in it.All in all I didnt care for the authors way of writing. But I think it will make for an interesting movie."
4,Couldn't put it down,Good book. I didn't care how accurate the information was. I found it hard to put it down.
5,A 'can't put it down' kind of story!,"When I first read the title and the back of this book, I wasn't the least bit interested. However --- two of my sisters, my daughter, and my niece were reading the book at the same time --- and all four of them loved it and recommended it highly. I had to get it --- and I had to agree with them! Its a great story! One that is amost impossible to put down! I highly recommend this read! I just hope the movie doesn't ruin it."
5,Very entertaining book!,This book was very entertaining and very realistic. I am very impressed with the research that went into this book and how the events were based off of previous events. I want to know more about what happened to the characters after the book!!!
3,Left me wondering,"There were definitely parts of this book I enjoyed, most of all the elderly Jacob and his point of view living in a nursing home. I was not so thrilled with the graphic cruelty of the animals, however, and some of those images are still haunting me. I do believe that the book overall would have been better if there was more concentration on the romantic development between Jacob and Marlena.The further I read into the book, the more questions I came away with, namely, how did they transport all the horses and an elephant to Chicago? Just wondering...."
2,Disappointed,"This book is an easy read - a straightforward, uncomplicated, simple story sprinkled with profanity, violence, animal cruelty, and sex. I think if you like books about the downside of humanity then this book might interest you. There's plenty of examples of human and animal exploitation. The ""love story"" aspect between Marlena and Jacob is lackluster at best."
2,Boring!,"I couldn't believe there were so many ppl who loved this book?It was so boring! The characters are lame and the storyline is something that could've been done inone page? I've read reviews about the sex scenes were graphic and the violence was immense....where was this?I heard there's a movie out and I think for the first time, the movie will be better than the book!"
3,This story could have gone better.,"This book started off fantastic. I have never read a story on such a topic so it was something new and interesting. However, it seems that 2/3 of the way through the novel, Sara Gruen gave up and wanted to just get the novel over and done with. This book had such potential but ended up not living up to my expectations."
3,Certainly not a fictional masterpiece...,"If you're a fan of really good books written by the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald or Ernest Hemingway, stop. The Amazon.com review on the book's main page tells you almost the entire story. The rest of the book is thousands of unnecessary words killing time between the major plot points. It's more a book for reading when you want to read something light than when you want to read something remarkable. The prose is pretty simple and the plot predictable, especially since the climax of the book is right in the first chapter! However, it was a good bedtime read."
3,Good story but not worthy of all the hype,"Just got back from vacation and was able to start and finishWater for Elephantsdespite having two 10-year-old boys keeping me busy. The story was engaging, and I enjoyed the details about circus life but thought the sexual parts were unnecessarily coarse, superfluous to the story (possibly added in the hopes of increasing the book's movie rights chances?), and detracted from the story. I liked how the author juxtaposed the main character's memories with his present situation but thought the ending was a cop-out. I'm not unhappy that I read this book but am definitely glad I bought it when it was on sale for $4.17.Formatting on the Kindle was good with no errors coming to mind."
5,Overwhelming read,"If you're an middle-aged old fart like me, this book might be too much for you. It was nearly overwhelming for me, and it invaded my dreams over the few nights in which I read it. Nonetheless, it's an excellent read. A rending read. A compelling read. Moreover, you might think the author knows you, and is telling a version of your life's story if you, like me, are a middle-aged old fart."
5,great book,This was a great book. It sucked you in within the first chapter and kept you sucked in the whole book. I never wanted to put the book down even to go to sleep!
4,Very good,This was a very good read. I've seen the movie so I knew pretty much what to expect. But the movie is nothing compared to the book.
1,Over-rated. Not sure why this became a best-seller.,"This was a Book Club selection last year and our group of seven were looking forward to enjoying a recent best-seller. None of us liked it. I thought the story about circus life was interesting but I did not like any of the characters and although I tried, could not find a redeeming quality in any of them. I also did not care much for the writing style. Had it not been for Book Club, I would have quit a quarter of the way."
2,If You Want To Be Depressed......,"I really had to struggle to get through this book. It seemed as if every page was more depressing than the last. As awful as the thought of being homeless is, I felt that Jacob would've been better off ditching that train long ago! I did enjoy the ending but that's about it. I can't imagine how (or why) they made a movie out of this story."
4,Good read.,I was very glad I choose to read this book. I really didn't think I'd like it- but really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down!
2,pointless,I was really disappointed by this book. The only parts that were not too bad were the chapters where Jacob was an old man. But the circus stuff was very pedestrian. No spark to the writing. Don't waste your time.
4,Fantastic,I could not put it down. I called in sick to work so I could finish the book. I highly recommend it.
4,Wonderful!,I really enjoyed this historical novel about a depression-era circus and the people who work in it.
4,Circa Circus,"Running away to the Circus is at the epicenter of this great adventure and I delighted in every page. The writing creates rich images of tastes, smells, senses and life on the road during the depression, interspersed with the realities of the cruel way Circus animals were once treated.The work of a great story teller and I believed every word."
4,BEYOND THE TENT - WHO KNEW?,"If you were a kid and experienced the train arriving, the parade of elephants, and the setting up of the big tent, this book will inform you of what went on behind the extravaganza! I saw the performers outside with their buckets, but who would ever imagine what their lives were like? I went to the side shows, ate the cotton candy and this book brought it all back! This is a great novel with circus history that I fully enjoyed! A perfect ending to those who wonder about Jacob's future!"
5,Solid Read,"I loved this book - there are a few naysayers in the sea of positive reviews and there is a reason for this. It is an excellent book - of course it is not air tight but it is a fun read and interesting. It reminded me in some way of the White City book in that it took history, in this case of the circus in a certain time period in history, and wove a story around this history. It took me a little less then two days to read it and well worth the story!ooking for a fun fast read with a great story line - buy and enjoy this book!"
2,Boring and hard to get through the first 200 pages,"I bought this book based on the recommendations from amazon. I found the book difficult to get through until the last 100 pages. The story is slow and simply tedious. I had to force myself through it. The end of the story, about 200-250 pages in, it picks up a bit and becomes more fast paced and readable."
5,A Fascinating Read,"Water for Elephants was mesmerizing. Form beginning to end, the characters were compelling and the research meticulous. I couldn't put the book down."
4,I liked it...,"I read several reviews (after reading the book) that lambasted the author saying the characters were thin and the storyline contrived - the reviewers aren't totally wrong. But, I still found it to be an enjoyable read. I read it in one sitting, it was a light read - a bit of mind candy. If you're looking for a ""make you think"" kind of read, I don't think this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for a pleasant story to wile away some time I don't think you will be disappointed."
5,"great read, couldnt ask for more!","Where to begin? A real page turner. I can't tell you how much housework i neglected to read this wonderful book. if you dont read anything else, you'll be fine with this one!"
5,Make sure you read the prologue first!,"My boss recommended this book to me, It turned out to be a great read at times i stayed up till 2 in the morning reading ,just didn't want to put it down! Can't wait to see the movie!"
4,Great Story!,I really liked this story. It reminded me of Stephen King's head prison guard from The Green Mile in that the author is telling the story from the point of view of an elderly man in the twilight of his life. The other charactures are richly portrayed. The story itself took me back to my childhood trips to the circus. This was a time before there were laws to protect unfortunates from exploitation.
3,so-so,"The book was interesting but I think mostly because the subject matter was something different. The characters in my opinion could have been fleshed out a lot more. It seemed to me to be a book written primarily so a movie could be made of it. It was more of an outline for a larger novel. Aside from that, again, it was interesting I just thought there should be more to it."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I am usually leary of books that are being made into motion pictures, but this book pleasantly surprised me. The play on words with the title and the actual story line leave you with something more to ponder. My only regret is that the character of Marlena, female lead, was not further developed."
4,enjoyable,This book was certainly different - and that's the kind of books I like. A love story of a very different kind . . . fascinating to learn of what goes on the 'behind the tent walls' of a circus. Added interest to the story.
5,Wonderful!,This book is one of the best I have read in a very long time. The author puts you in the depression era circus travels. The writing is so good you can almost smell the popcorn and peanuts. You experience the animals and the humans alike. I could not put it down and finished it in 2 days. Well worth your time!! I am sending it along to my family members.
4,Water for elephants was amazing!,"The book its self was amazing let alone the characters. The characters, such as Jacob and Marlana, became a part of me, Walter and Camel too. I love this book and probably always will."
4,Great Book,Didn't know what to expect from this book when I start to read it and it turns out to be an amazing book!
5,Just great!,This book was just great. The author clearly did her homework- very well researched. It is no surprise such a fast-paced book was made into a film.
5,Good read,Thus book was amazingly written I was initially not going to read the book because I don't like to read books that I've already seen the movie to in the end I'm really glad I did
2,Inappropriate language,"There was a lot of sexual language that didn't add to the story at all. I enjoyed the movie and the story followed the movie well, it just had a lot more sexual content than I want to read."
4,Water for elephants review,This story grabs you with swirly plots and colorful characters who live an extraordinary life style in the circus. Water for Elephants is for anyone who has a drop of gypsy in their blood or even just wishes they could live out their dreams of adventure.
4,A book for all ages,I was intrigued by the circus as a child and made sure that my children and grand c children also were able enjoyed it. It was great to find out about going ons
2,Good to annoying,"The book was good in the beginning. I found it was well written and interesting enough, but as I progressed the story and characters got highly annoying and unrealistic to me. By reading the prologue I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end of the book, no suprise at all. The ending was rushed and jammed all together, seemed like the author ran out of time or like me was sick of the story herself. Overall I found it very disappointing."
3,Sophie's Choice at the Circus,"The love triangle at the heart of the narrative comes right out of Sophie's Choice. A beautiful yet disconnected young woman and her gregarious alpha male husband befriend and uplift a lonely young intellectual. The climax confrontation and subsequent revelation of the true nature of the husband's problems are blatant plagiarisms. But the thing that tipped me off early on wasn't the love triangle. It was instead when a character named Kinko is mistakenly referred to as ""stinko"". You may recall Meryl Streep doing the same thing when referring to Stingo. Unfortuantely for fans of this book, the alpha male character, August, has none of the charms of Kevin Kline.Yet for all its faults I did enjoy the book. It was very hard to put down, but that may be because the circus is a favorite subject of mine."
3,WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE,"SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT I READ THIS BOOK. I HAVE OBSERVED PEOPLE READING THIS BOOK ON AIRPLANES, IN CARPOOL LINES, SITTING ON A BENCH AT BARK PARK, SO I DECIDED IT WAS A MUST READ JUST TO FEEL LIKE I BELONGED IN A SOCIETY. THE BOOK IS INTERESTING, PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE FASCINATED WITH THE CIRCUS AS A YOUNG CHILD. I FOUND THE ANIMAL BRUTALITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS I HAD ANTICIPATED, BUT WHAT I DID MOSTLY REMEMBER AT THE END. IT'S A GOOD READ, NOT A GREAT READ. THE ONLY FLAW I WOULD MENTION IS THE NARRATOR'S VOICE WAS NOT PLAUSIBLE AS A NINETY YEAR OLD MAN. THE AUTHOR MIGHT HAVE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH IN THAT AREA, BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM READING THE BOOK."
4,Loved this story,"I really loved this story, especially the ending. I really enjoyed hearing about circus life, which surprised me, I'm not a fan of the circus at all. I thought Sara Gruen did a great job telling this story but I would have like to have seen a little more character development. It also had a little extra appeal for me as the story starts out in Ithaca, NY not far from where I grew up and not far from where I live now."
1,A bestseller? How is that possible?,"I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it."
3,Well written but a thin plot,"Water for Elephants: A NovelI thoroughly enjoyed spending time with Jacob Jankowski in his nineties. His perceptions of his memory (longterm and recent) is illuminating and real.However, I thought the plot was not as sophisticated as the writing. Nice clean college boy falls in love and rescues beautiful maiden from the other side of the tracks..."
4,Water for Elephants,"Great reading, author has good command of descriptive sentences without being too wordy. Fast paced action. Ending slightly unrealistic -- a 90 year old man could not survive for very long in a circus family without diligent care."
3,Fun History,"Interesting circus history, but I did get a little nervous about what might happen to the animals. Quick, somewhat simple read, nice."
3,Not horrible...,"This is definitely a slow starter, and the pace picks up only slightly about 2/3 through. A decent story line but not something I'd read again."
2,Well written,"I loved the the authors narrator flashing back and forth to his times in the circus to his time in the home. Although, I would have liked to read more about his and Marlana's history with the other circuses and their life after the circus."
3,Water for elephants,Thought overall book was great.... a little long and drawn out on parts. I skipped at parts to make it through these parts. Liked movie much better!Tinalgrande
2,Disappointed,"So, I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie and so I did. I loved the part where they did Jake as an old man. But as far as the love story, very disappointed. I have yet to watch the movie, but I heard it was great!Will watch soon.Sincerely,Disappointed Reader"
3,Water review,Had some trouble getting into the book; the story line was good. Liked interview with the author at the end.
3,Water for Elephants,"Good book, good story, condition is just okay.....I was hoping for a larger type...I thought that I had ordered the large print,oops!!! Interesting especially if you have seen the movie....."
3,i wasn't impressed,"i just got done reading this and i was enjoying it till about half way thru. then it became immensely boring to me and i kdpt reading only to say that i finished it. i really don't think it had much of a plot and i feel the ending was kind of just ""wrapped up"" quickly. it started out very hopeful, but in the end, not one of my favorite reads."
5,Loved this book! Read it twice!,One of the best books I have ever read. Truly a great joy to read. All the woman in my family have read it and we all came away loving the story. I fell in love with Rosie the elephant.
3,"Easy to read, but a little boring","I had heard from basically EVERYONE that I must read this book. So I did. It was easy to read and it moderately held my interest. Mostly the characters seemed one note. I kept hoping the idiosyncrasies and oddities that make a character come to life would surface, but alas they did not. The protagonist was as flat as a pancake.It was pleasant enough, but in no way life changing."
5,Loved it!,This is a great read! The story line is great and the author writes in a way that keeps you engaaged throughout. I plan to keep this in my book collection ( I resell many ) as I think it's a book a friend would enjoy reading.
3,So So,"After hearing so much hype about this book I quickly read it before the movie came out. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't the super excited about it either. I liked the perspective from which the story was told - a feisty 90-something old man reflecting in flashbacks on his adventures in a travelling circus 70 years earlier, while lamenting the indignities of his current nursing-home existence. Jacob Jankowski, just days from the final exams at Cornell University becoming a vet, had his world forever altered when his parents are killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, the 23 yr. old hops a train, never intending to “run away with the circus”. Harsh conditions at the circus and an insane animal trainer are some of the things Jacob has to contend with living his life with the circus."
2,didn't like it,I didn't like the story line and the lanuguage and sexual content. It was much too graphic for me. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone
3,I enjoyed this story...,"Mainly because I wanted to know what would happen next. The writing, didn't have me coming back, but the twists in the plot did."
3,"Interesting story and characters, but the ending is too ""Disney-like""","Interesting book that makes you want to keep reading, but in the end, it seems like the author tried too hard to wrap things up and make everyone happy.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"
3,Ok but not one of my favourites...,"Water for Elephants... what can I say? The characters were all a bit sad and depressing. The story was not at all uplifting and left me feeling a little down. What is good is that you get a great insight into the travelling circus, training around spending one night in each location. Poor workers had such a hard time of it. Worth reading but don't expect a happy little love story with this one. Oh and I thought the ending was quite unbelieveable."
3,Good,I enjoyed this story or book. I liked the story telling of a ninety ir ninety three year old gentleman. He truly loved his life.
3,interestingly good,The book starts off a little slow but picks up after maybe chapter 4-5. I enjoyed Jacobs nursing home point of view that is emphasized a lot vs the movie. Its very detailed which makes it easy to follow the characters emotions and circus lingo.
2,Pointless drivel,"This book was just pointless. I feel like I was reading a novel generated by a random plot generator which spit out a circus, an old guy and a young guy-- nothing had the tactical feel of reality in this book. It was mediocre at best. Even the title of the novel was anticlimactic, given that one of old Jacob's nursing home fellows said he used to carry water for elephants and then not mentioned again. This novel is devoid of anything making it worth reading: Complex plot? No; Mercurial characters? No; Insights into the human condition? No; Stupendous vocabulary and/or Joycean constructions with the English language? No. Instead, we are left with chapter after chapter of a book better suited as children's literature."
2,Not up to par,Are you kidding me? This book was a best seller? It could have been written by a middle school student. I read this book in two days flat. The characters were very shallow. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because parts of it were cute but overall it was a waste of my time.
2,Doesn't hold water,"I found this book fairly well crafted, but did not believe in the characters or the story, which seemed awfully thin and contrived. The author admits in a postscript that she borrowed extensively from old newspaper stories and made up composite characters based on real-life people and animals, which is close to plagiarism if you ask me. The main character, Jacob, who is 93, and tell the story in flashbacks, is much too lucid for his age to be credible, and Marlena, the woman he eventually steals, comes across as flat and uninteresting.Like other reviewers, I found the dialogue artificial and at times anachronistic. Haven't seen the movie but not much source material to work with."
2,Not so great :(,"I bought this book around the time the movie came out, and I still haven't finished it. I've never seen the movie, and only bought this book because it had good reviews on Amazon. However this book turned out to be quite a disappointment.Pros:- interesting subjectCons:- Awful cliched characters- No character development- story told in very umimspired mannerI don't understand why people like this book. Its slow and pulpy."
2,"Okay, but...","I thought the story line was good and the plot kept me engaged. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. A real page turner. However....I think the author went overboard in some of the sexual scenes and explanations. The story would have been just as good without the graphic content which makes this inappropriate for younger readers or families. It is definitely an ""adults only"" book. Had it had signicantly less graphic sexual content, I would have rated it much higher."
2,If I wanted to read about old men's winkies....,"Depressing and boring.If I wanted to read about old men's winkies...well, I don't.I found this book deeply inpenetrable and despite forcing myself to read on, I kept asking myself ""Why""? Sadly, the answer that came back was ""Because so many people rave about it.""Well, I'm sorry for being a cultural heathen but I found nothing to recommend in this book and cant understand all the fuss."
3,"An okay novel, mediocre for my taste","I liked the ending of this book better than any other part. This mans life after the death of his parents was hard, as expected. It dragged on for me, until the end when he was living his last years of his life in a nursing home. his children disregarded him emotionally. They went to visit, but real interest in him was gone. They did their duty. He escapes in the end and lives out his life with the circus. The place where he lived most of his life after his parents death.It was good, not great for me."
3,Paid for hard cover received soft,A few pages have slight water damage and the biggest disappointment was that I PAID for hardcover and received a soft cover.. I am a book collector of sorts so this was very disappointing. over all ok though.
1,Trite JV fiction,The book is just plain bad. The story is ridiculously simple and unimagitive. The writing is bland and the plot overdone and predictable. Take out the unnecessary and horrendous animal abuse depicted and you're left with a juvenile fiction romance novel.
1,Couldn't wait to put it down!,"I didn't get into the characters at all, I skipped the last 100 pages and read the last chapter."
5,An Unforgettable Novel,"When you read Water for Elephants, you will be absorbed into the circus era of the 1930's. Taking a step back in time, Sara Gruen has written an intriguing tale of love, deception, and memories. Her depiction of the circus, the animals, and the characters is hopelessly addicting -- you will not want to put the book down once you begin reading!"
1,Boring + Evil = Crap,"I found the main characters, Jacob, Marlena, and August exasperating. Jacob was weak and could barely help a flea, Marlena was weak too, and August was evil. Any focus on Marlena and Jacob was especially irritating. I was so bored by them - I didn't care about them - they could have died for all I cared. These two kept letting the sicko torture poor Rosie - I was disgusted how repetitive this scene became.Too bad the main characters couldn't have been Earl, who had to deal with these three - Greg, who should have been the veterinarian, and Walter, who was the only one with sense enough to recognize an evil sadist. Oh' and the whores, who at least knew themselves, unlike victim Marlena.The only success of the book was Jacob in old age. I could empathize with old age Jacob.The animal abuse was heartbreaking. I'm not sure why I finished this book."
1,"Not convincing, dull protagonist",The protagonist is not convincingly portrayed. He impresses as a bit dull. Somehow he acted without characteristics that justify his actions.
5,Wonderful book,What a wonderfully written book. The research and details are amazing. It really leaves you feeling like you've gotten a peek into the life of a traveling circus.
4,Amazing,Love reading historical fiction that has been researched. Amazing. I would recommend to my adult friends that love to read the same
5,Even Better The Second Time Around!,"I adored Water For Elephants when I read it the first time, but it was on my second reading that I realized the extreme skill Gruen exhibits on every page and in every scene. Her prose is crisp and exacting, and her characters are so vivid, they leap to life in this story that grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. I was literally transported to another place in time. I can't recommend Water For Elephants highly enough. This book deserves all the praise it's received and then some. What a beautiful novel--a treasure for all who curl up with this gem!"
5,If You Love A Happy Ending,"This wonderful book was so exuberant, so filled with vivid discriptions that I could smell the cotton candy and the elephant dung. I was captured from the first page. If you remember the circus coming to town or,even if you don't and wish you did, read this book and live the life."
4,A Great & Entertaining Book,"I had been wanting to read this for awhile, so I finally ordered it from Amazon. I was not disappointed! The story was wonderful, uplifting, and bittersweet. Gruen's research on circus history added much to an already entertaining plot.This is another book my 14-year-old son read after I did. There are some graphic parts though, so use your own judgment before you pass it on to your kids.Enjoy!"
5,Pure Wonderful,"I just started reading again recently and I have to say this has become one of my favorite books ever! Such a wonderful story of love, devotion and sacrifice. I literally could not put the book down. It reels you in and your hooked until the last page."
5,Great literature pulls you in,"I can see why so many were talking about this book. It is a wonderful story, with such rich character description you feel like a character in the book. I loved it and would recommend to all my friends."
3,Great read,Loved this book! A great story and insight into the time period and life during those times. Highly recommend this book
5,Great ending,Loved the story. I found the circus content to be very interesting. Some of the facts being based on actual events in history made me more interested. I had to Google and read more about the history of the circus. Pictures were a great addition.
4,Water for elephants,"I feel in love with the characters in this book and enjoyed each of their adventures, trials and tribulations. I will remember this story for years to come."
1,"Seriously, why do people like this book??","I did not love this book...I didn't quite hate it, but, compared to my expectations given its high rating, yeah, I hated the experience of reading this book. So disappointing.The story carries you along, and the characters are somewhat interesting. The real issue is that this whole book just feels like a cliche. The characters behave painfully predictably, and the author can't seem to give the characters enough depth to make this feel real. I can't stand to not finish a book, so I did read the whole thing, but wow, what a waste of time. I have to agree with other reviewers, too, the inclusion of graphic sex scenes and curse words really felt out of place with the rest of the story, and did nothing to improve my opinion of the author. Interestingly, those scenes felt the most authentic to me, so perhaps the author should've researched the emotional side of human relationships a bit more than the physical side.Boring BORING depressing and disappointing read."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I give the author an ""A"" for research, but really this book was quite boring. I'm not sure why anyone would give this book 5 stars, unless they have an obsession for the circus. I just don't get it."
5,Rosie rocks!,You will NOT be disappointed in this book; a real page-turner that you cannot put down! The characters and story are wonderful; I cannot wait for the movie.
2,fairly good story,Did not like the book. I especially didn't like the fact that no one could stop the elephant abuse and didn't like the sex in it. Pretty crude. Too bad they had to add the graffic sex. It wasn't necessary to the story!
1,Exactly why I don't read fiction,"Was talked into reading this as a change from non-fiction. I read all the reviews about not being able to put the book down. I had to force myself to finish it. Ridiculous, cliched, almost campy dialogue. What exactly, is supposed to grab you & make you continue? Boy, I wanted to like this. Sorry."
4,Great Novel about the circus in the 1930's.,This is an outstanding novel. One can get a greater appreciation for the 1930's after reading this book. It is also a great love story. I would recommend to anyone.
5,Water For Elephants,"This is one of the best books I have read. From page one until the end, I was completely taken with the story. I was disappointed when the book ended and I ordered the next book this author, Sara Gruen, had written.I highly recommend this book. Well done~!! The story takes you to the circus and makes you feel as if you are living with the characters.I can't say enough good about this book~!!"
5,No wonder it got made into a movie,"Great story, charming characters. I was fully engaged in the story. A lovely tale to showcase a bit of circus history."
4,Water for Elephants,"I really enjoyed readng Water for Elephants. The book,in my opinion, is better than the movie. I think the characters were more developed in the book and the explanations regarding circus life were excellent for someone like me, who didnt know anything about the circuit. It was a very good read."
3,Good Ol' Hyperbole,"Abandoned drop-out Cornell vetLooks after all the circus petsFalls in love with someone's wife,Of her he'll think for all his life.Barbara's chest or the Fat Lady--It's all good ol' hyperbole,They'll make you laugh and maybe cry,But you feel they're just a circus sight:When show's over all shuffle home,Men to bars and tigers to bones,Adulterous romps can only so long last,Hands part and hearts get stuck in the forever past.(Must Love always beGood ol' hyperbole?)"
5,Great read!,"Water for Elephants: A NovelThis was a wonderful book. Written from the prospective of an old man as he dreams of his life in the circus, it is a good insight into those of us who get older, live with our memories and our loved ones have no idea of our past lives. I really loved the ending. Very fitting! Newfmom"
5,A lovely read,This is a lovely read. A story line that is original and not at all complicated without becoming bubble gum for the mind. A feel good book!!
4,A Great Ending,"This book was about to get three stars from me until I reached the end. The ending is wonderful and completely redeemed the story.The story is about a veterinarian who has a breakdown after his parents are killed. He jumps a train at night that turns out to be a traveling circus. He is quickly absorbed into the not so glamorous drama of circus life.The author seems to have done her research and the book was always interesting enough to keep me turning the page. It did lag during the middle, but the ending nailed it home.This book is worth your time."
4,Page turning book!,"I just finished reading Water for Elephants and thought this book was pretty good. I really could not put the book down! I had to force myself to close the book because If I wanted to, I could finish it in a day. I choose to read this book since it had such high ratings. I'm glad I picked it up."
2,Not my favorite,"I really didn't like this book very much. In its favor, it's well researched, but the crudeness of the characters and animal cruelty turned me off. I'm sure it's very accurate in its portrayal of the times, I'd just rather read something uplifting. I read it based on a recommendation from a family member. I, on the other hand, would not recommend it."
2,Don't Understand the Rave Reviews,"After all the hype about this book, I finally gave in to reading a borrowed copy. I wanted to like it, truly I did. I made it to page 164 with some effort. The characters were not developed well enough for me to like them. Also, I work with elderly people and the narrator as an elderly man was not altogether believable.What I did enjoy was learning a bit about the circus business back in the 30s.Please if you know of some real 5-star novels, non-romance, let me know."
2,dissapointing,borrowed this book from the kindle library and only had it a day before I ended up returning it....i found the parts that I read pornographic and vulgar...makes me sad for the world and those that AREN'T bothered by such things...guess I should just stick to the young adult novels...*sigh*
4,Good Read!,"I really enjoyed this book. I was a little disappointed at the end, because there was a build-up to a romance...and when it finally happened, it was a brief description. Cool insights on circus life...never thought I would enjoy reading a book like this. I can't wait to see the movie."
5,Thanks,Love this book. My daughter and I both have read the book and watched the movie.I would recommend to anyone
4,A Good Read,This is a very good read. Circus life isn't a subject I know much about so from the historical perspective it was very interesting. I like that the story incorporates so many different sociological issues and is such a good argument for animal rights...especially circus animals.
5,Can't put it down!,"This book keeps you up late at night because you keep telling yourself, maybe I'll just read ONE more chapter..."
5,favorite,"This is absolutely one of my favorite books ever.I checked it out of the library to read but when I was done, I knew I had to own it.I have little desire to see the movie for fear it will not do the book justice. A must read."
2,I must be missing something,"I just can't get past chapter 5. I bought this based on all the reviews. Sadly, I must move on. I alsways feel guilty for not finishing a book. Even time at the beach did not help."
4,No Title,"This book was a semi-interesting read. It was interesting enough to keep me reading it, but the writing is pretty elementary. It makes a good mindless airplane read.If you are interested in reading about carnies, I highly recommend ""Geek Love"". Way better than this book."
2,Not for me..I was bored!,I was so bored that I couldn't finish this book. This was a book club book and some of friends loved it but not me. I just couldn't get into it. It's not as engaging as I thought it would be. I hope the movie is better.
3,Entertaining? Yes. A Masterpiece? No.,"This story alternates between present-day and flashbacks through the mind of our now 93-year-old main character. The historical aspects of this book are incredibly well-researched and do a great deal to advance the plot of the story. Unfortunately, the present-day scenes are rather dull. I found myself skimming over those sections because I was eager to return to reading about Jacob's life working on the circus in the 1930s.The love story in this book - a tale of forbidden love between Jacob and Marlena, the married star of the big top show - is sweet, but ultimately predictable. With the exception of one sharp twist, I felt that the love story ending of this novel is fairly cookie cutter. That being said, I can't deny the fact that I was thoroughly entertained by every page."
3,Nice Period Piece but not great,There were many positives about the story - 1) Nice feel of what it was like to be in the circus during the depression 2) Great analysis of what it is like to be old in a rest home. 3) Excellent voice characters for the audio. 4) Beginning of good bi-polar character.Negative - 1) Feel of the story moved from period piece about the circus to feel of Nazi camp where all leaders are evil 2) Instead of developing bi-polar character he was just written off as evil. 3) One big surprise in the book concerning the murder but not that monumental. 4) Three needless scenes that bordered on pornographic.
5,READ IT !! Just do it !!,"A 90+ gentleman (sharp as a tack) in a nursing home watches from the window as a circus comes to town. He takes us back in time to his own ""carny"" days as a veternarian for the circus animals. So far sounds boring as heck, doesn't it? Well, this is one old gent you come to really like. We learn a lot about the shenanigans behind the scenes of the circus as well as the plight of those during the depression. Again, sounds boring. But this author makes it a story you can't put down. This is a testament to a great writer. I believe she could make the phone book interesting. JUST READ IT !! You won't be disappointed."
5,Delightful,A captivating story about a lesser known part of American history. So unique. I couldn't put it down. A real page turner
4,Rosie,Loved the book and Rosie! Could not put the book down...took a bit to get into it but then really enjoyed it!!!!
5,Couldn't put it down,"Such a great book. Flash back from the main character's POV. Not my usual genre of book, but absolutely fell in love with this book. I could not put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. Absolutely delightful!"
3,Not as great as the hype built around it,"I finally got around to reading Water for Elephants, it's been on my Kindle forever. I was interested in seeing the movie, but didn't want to until I read the book.It was good, especially the end. At times I wanted to finish just to move on to my next book, but at the end of I was hooked on seeing what would happen next. For some reason, I didn't get what all the craze was about though. Probably because I read a lot of really excellent books this year, including another circus book that blew this one away."
2,Water for Elephants,"Amazon has lots of choices of books to buy and Kindle books are great, Thank goodness this book doesn't take space in my house but is on my Kindle.The story was interesting. I did learn about the circus and am glad I didn't live in that era. Humans haven't evolved much since then though. There were caring people then but there are still the abusers of animals and their fellow man. It was an emotional story but not fast moving enough for me."
3,"A page turner, but not memorable","This book is a page turner, but it certainly did not live up to the hype. It is reminiscent of older works like The Great Gatsby and Fifth Business, but doesn't try to be deep. Yes, the point of view of the old man was done well, but frankly quite boring. The love story felt flat (what exactly did they see in each other? neither had any personality)"
3,Water for Elephants,"For the most part this was a moving and fascinating story. Well written, the characters were vivid and appealing, even, at times, the villains. However, I found the way the story ended to be somewhat trite and not at all believable.Although the loyalty and brotherhood among circus people was clearly portrayed throughout, the end of the story reduced this excellent portrait of a mysterious and esoteric world into a fairy-tale. For me, the lovely flight ended with a thud, from a delicious learning experience to an insult to my intelligence."
2,Ruined by poor editing,"My wife was very keen to read this book having enjoyed the movie (I haven't made the time to read it given her comments).Basically she really enjoyed the story and found it expanded on the movie however, a large number of typing and formating errors in this ebook ruined the reading experience as she found these mistakes ruined the flow of the story.Surely a read through by a proof reader wouldn't have made the item that much more expensive!?!"
3,Different,"If you saw the movie, the book is the same. It was definitely interesting enough to keep you reading. In the end, though, I felt... a little unmoved. I expected a lot more since the ratings were so high. Maybe it just wasn't the kind of book for me. It was entertaining but not too exciting."
2,Just do not see all the hype,"I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not ""stellar"" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes."
4,Not Just a Circus Book,"I purchased ""Water for Elephants"" together with several other books to give me something to do while I recovered from surgery. To be honest, I was afraid that this book would simply novelize the seamier side of circus life. It does, but offers the reader so much more. I would recommend this to teachers (of grades 11 and beyond) as a cross-curriculum tool when teaching about the Great Depression.Beyond its educational attributes, this is a novel about love, loss, and the frailty of the human condition. Animal lovers will weep as ""Water for Elephants"" weaves most of the animals into characters that advance the story.Is this THE great American novel? Probably not. Is this a moving, well-written, joy of a novel? Without question."
5,Fantastic read - just what I was looking for,"I was looking for a great ""beach book"" to read this summer - dramatic, romantic, and yet intelligent. This was all three. Despite not knowing anything about or having much interest in the circus or the depression era, I read the entire thing in a couple days. I love how the author pulls you into the characters and the storyline and book has one of the most fantastic endings I've ever read! You're in for a spectacular read!"
4,Quick interesting read,I really enjoyed the book. There were a few times I wish it wasn't so graphic but found it necessary in the long run.
4,loved it.,"This book exceeded my expectations, as a first time reader of Sara Gruen -I am fairly impressed. It was an easy read, and quite easy to follow. The way this story jumps back and forward from Mr. Jankowski's youth to old age is alluring and comical. At times this story had me laughing aloud."
3,Wish the book was as good as the cover,"Despite haunting cover art and a great title, despite obvious research and well thought out prose, and despite the fact that this book is the darling of the Independent Booksellers Association, I felt let down. Part of the problem was that I expected a lot and had held this book on my shelf, until I could really savor it. It does start out strong, and Gruen keeps her time periods well separated. But the characters, especially the narrator, feel stock and unfinished and merely devices on which to hang the proceeds of research. Because of the plusses of the book enumerated in the opening sentence of my review, I give 3 stars, but for the back story, it would be fewer."
2,Really disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book after all the hype it received, but I was disappointed. The characters are shallow, the animal abuse is horrific and disturbing, and I haven't got any idea why all of the graphic sexual content was even in there, as it adds nothing to the story. It is an easy read, only 1 day, but I felt very unsatisfied after I finished it. I really expected more after all the research that was supposed to have been done before it was written. I would not recommend buying it."
3,Not as good as the reviews would lead you to believe.,I thought the setting and milieu were much more interesting than the characters and their development. The background was interesting but the characters were not. They lacked depth and seemed cast as types rather than developed as characters who are realistic in their setting.
2,Highly Overrated,"Don't be fooled by the majority of the reviews - this novel is little more than a lame romance. I'm not inherently opposed to romance novels, but this one has the guise of being so much more than that. The characters are nothing more than one-dimensional caricatures. If the book was merely marketed as being a transparent, sappy romance novel set within the confines of a traveling circus, fine. But it has the air of being somewhat of an intellectual read, with realistic characters, perhaps an accurate summation of what life really was like to live (and sure, love) on a circus in the early days, and it's none of those things. I not only didn't like the novel, I felt somewhat betrayed and offended by it. If I could have demanded that the author give me my money back, I would have. If you're looking for an easy read that isn't the least bit challenging or innovative, then this might be perfect for you. Otherwise, save yourself the money."
4,About so much more than the circus,"Water for Elephants took a little while to fully grab my attention, with the flash backs between the circus and Jacob's time in the nursing home. Once it got my attention it held it right through to the very end.There were a few relationships that stood out in my mind. The first was between Rosemary and Jacob. Their relationship exemplified the relationship I would hope all nursing home staff had with the residents. Her understanding and patience as Jacob flashes back and forth between the present day and his youth is remarkable, and her connection seems to surpass the bond he shares with his children.I never would have thought I would enjoy a book that centered around the cicus, but this novel was about so much more than just the shows under the big top. It focused on love, friendship, aging and compassion."
5,Water for Elephants,"I loved this book, very entertaining, easy to follow, enjoyed this book and can't wait to see the movie. I want to read more of her books."
5,Good Book for Just About Anyone,"I really enjoyed this book. I think that no matter what type of genre of books you're into, you'll probably like this one."
5,Water for Elephants,"I picked this book up several times and finally read it, could not put it down reading it past bedtime. I love books like this where the author gets the details right, how she explains that after 30 something happens and you suddenly forget or at least hesitate thinking, ""It's my 30th birthday or wait is it my 33rd""?"
2,A bit dull,"I purchased this book because it received great reviews from readers on amazon.com. Truthfully, I was disappointed because I found the book rather dull. There was very little action in the novel and I did not emphathize with any of the characters other than Jankowski in his 90s in the assisted living facility. The insight provided into the ""circus world"" of the Great Depression was interesting, but overall, I would not recommend the book."
1,anti semititic,No sympathetic charactersI was angry About having spent a dime on this.Contributed to a sense that all good books already exist
2,Disappointment,"Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring."
2,not an easy read for animal lovers,"It's written unbelievably well, the attention to detail is phenomenal ... but as someone who has to change the channel when an animal abuse case comes up ... I couldn't help feeling sick to stomach when the author went into detail about just how miserable these poor circus animals' existence was (and from doing a little research, still is in some ways). Having said that, I would still recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about circus life in the 20's, and the romance that enfolds is subtle and very beautiful as well."
3,fun to read but will be forgotten in a few years,"This book was fun. The old circus is always fascinating and fun.I read the book very quickly, which is unusual for me. If you like fun easy books, then this is a good one for you.But this book is not literature, and will be forgotten soon, and won't be read in 10 years. It does not compare with Amy Tan, who has written literature that will probably continue to be read for a hundred years."
1,"Intriguing story, but....","I started reading this book because I saw the movie first and a friend had said it was a good read. The story is very interesting. I especially liked learning about Jacob Jankowski's time in the nursing home. However, this has to be one of the most sexually explicit things I have ever read. If you are even the tiniest bit concerned about decent behavior and morality, DO NOT read this book. If it hadn't been for the chapter fully discussing a dancer removing her clothes (which I skipped over once I found out what it was), or the mention of these ""8-pagers"", I might have thoroughly enjoyed it. I stopped reading and it is now deleted from my Kindle. I know sex sells, but come on people, let's have some decency and morality for a change."
2,water for elephants,"Not my kind of story; read a few chapters after recommendation by a friend, but never could get into it!"
2,Water for elephants,Ok. Better since I didn't have to look at Edward Cullen. Lol. Will read more of her books in future
5,Great book,I really got into this book. I think it was very well written. At first I was turned off about the circus theme but this book is SO much more than that!
4,Summer Fiction,"This was a good book to read over the summer. Different than The Kite Runner, or The Road but on par with them.Life of Pi"
4,Unusual and interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. It was like nothing I had ever read before. Not my favorite, but still captivating. Definitely worth it!"
2,Surprising soft-porn....,I have to be honest and admit I didn't read the entire book. Less than 60 pages in there's a graphic description of one of the circus acts .. a striptease. If you like to read this kind of thing I guess it's no problem but for me it was way way too much....and a disappointment. Wish I'd read this in one of the other reviews to save myself the cost of the book... : (
2,water for elephants,I did not like this book at all...I thought it cruel..even in fiction ...i do not like reading about people who torment simply because they can...i couldn't finish this novel...
3,Swimming Against the Flow,"I felt that some mention should have been made of the large amount of sex and violence this book contained. The story line was interesting, and I enjoyed the surprise ending. In a good book, with a lot going for it, I don't see the need for graphic sex and violence. Maybe that's what sells, and picks up movie contracts."
2,Eh... What is all the hype about?,"I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a BAD read, but it utterly underwhelming.I have to admit, I'm only about 85% of the way through, but I really wouldn't care whether I finished it or not.I can't really criticize it for much other than not even beginning to live up to the hype that is surrounding it. It is neither here nor there. At least it is a quick read and it wasn't too expensive.Normally I go for the free or $.99 kindle books, all the hype made me spring for this and I'm sorry that I did."
2,The movie was like junk food for the soul...,Going to see this movie about a tyrant psycho circus owner who beats elephants till they bleed and abuses his workers cannot bring any more hope to a world already drowning in stories of despair. I hope the book was better.
2,Okay,I couldn't really get into the book. Still have not seen the movie either but to me the book starts out slow and I hate books like that
3,Save time and watch the movie,"I enjoyed the book, but quite honestly, it is one of the very few books I prefer the movie over. I feel that by the end of the book, I don't know the characters much better than I did when the book began."
2,Did not live up to the hype,I didn't even finish this one. It just didn't keep my attention. I also didn't like the animal and human abuse it contained.
3,Leaves you disappointed,"This is a very quick read, but the prose is often uninspiring and perfunctorily written, the ending is completely predictable, and the great love between Jacob and Marlena is unconvincing. Important (or what should have been important) events are skimmed over (such as the deaths of major characters) and I just found myself feeling that the plot was terribly unoriginal but set in a world of fantasy that was supposed to have made up for the lack of fantastic storytelling. And worst of all, the main characters lacked the charisma that would have allowed a reader to forgive the previously mentioned faults."
2,It was alright,"I purchased this book based on the reviews and the number of people that read it. I thought I would be blown away with a book I could not put down. Unfortunately it was just the opposite, I found myself struggling to finish the book. It was just a strange story. I have talked to others who have read it and said how great it was. This book was not my bag of tea. I just felt that with the combination of murder, romance, and factual items it just did not pull together for me. It really invoked no connection to the characters, the animals or the setting. I would have been fine not finishing it and I would have never wondered what the ending was like. There were excerpts in the book that had no impact on the story line, but just seemed to float out there and I wondered why they seemed so out of place, why did the author add that part? Not sure why so many people ranked this so high?"
4,Water for elephants,"Really great story,you can wrap yourself around the period of history. You can feel the hardships and the struggles. The characters are intriguing."
4,The book was amazing but......,"The ending wasn't as good as it could have been... the book was incredible though, one of the best I have ever read!"
5,Good read...,"I didn't want to start this book because I'm an animal lover,& I heard some parts were too hard to read. They are tough, but the book is worth reading."
4,I want more!,"Mostly I think books are to long and a bit of editing wouldn't have hurt the story. But with Water for Elephants I crave more, more circus anectodes, more about the people and animals. I think this is a really splendid book, about a very fascinating subject, a train circus during the depressions, I will not tell you more, just read it! I will countinue with Sara Gruen's other books!"
5,So good!,"FINALLY a book that Amazon recommended that I just LOVED! It was so interesting, wow! I had NO idea what went on behind the scenes at the circus back in the day! I devoured this book within two days because I just had to know how it would end!"
5,"This book should be required reading for ""Boomers""!","I love this book because the characters are engaging and unique, the settings both mundane and fantastical and the ending perfect! I want to be Jacob J. when I get old(er). Thank you for a marvelous book."
5,A wonderful book,"I loved Water for Elephants. Author Sara Gruen managed to place herself in the head of both a ninety-year-old man with Alzheimers in a nursing home, and a twenty-three-year-old man who had a great life ahead of him until tragedy struck. She swung back and forth between the character's present drab life to the unpredictable depression era circus of his youth so naturally that I was amazed how often I forgot I was reading a book. I was so entranced by the scenery and story that it just flowed along like I was watching it, or more accurately, living it with the characters. It's not often storytellers do this good a job in our generation. I have recommended this book to many people. Gruen is a writer to watch."
5,Great Read,"I just finished ""Water for Elephants"" and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read with compelling characters and engrossing storyline. I just couldn't put this down which is unusual for me. I loved both stories - the old man reaching the end of his life and the young vet who joins the circus out of desperation during the depression. You can't go wrong with this one."
4,Rosie's Lament,"The story was very enthralling. I had trouble putting it down. The writer made the pictures so vivid that I felt like I was in the story.I hated the animal abuse chapter and could hear the elephant screaming.I did not live in those days, but felt like I was watching an old movie..with costumes and everything.A good read."
4,First book I have read in years.,"I have just started reading again and I decided this would be my first book in years.I was not disappointed as the author paints a vivid picture of the characters with an adequate storyline. If you are looking for large adventures in the Circus, then this book is probably not for you.. but if you are interested in a good read with some very interesting characters, then I recommend it.It brings you into a world that you likely never knew existed."
4,I'm glad I read it,"This most definitely did not fall within my realm of normal reading material. Sometimes you have to venture out of your neighborhood though. I'm really glad I did. The story was very vivid. It felt real and gritty. I can still recount so much of it although I read it a year ago. For me, it was worth the wander from the norm."
4,Good summer read,I read this because the movie was coming out and I like to read the book first if there is one. I LOVED the book - heard some bad reviews of the movie - and still haven't seen it months later. I really enjoyed reading from the man's perspective. The ending seemed very complete and well crafted.
4,Water for Elephants review,This is a very interesting and well written novel. The characters are well developed. The reader will develop feelings for the characters and remember them well after the novel is finished. Also the setting in mid-depression America is nicely described. The story flows nicely. The back and forth from current events in a nursing home to the remembered events of a youth in the depression is unique and works well.We read this for a book club with about 20 readers. Comments ranged from favorable to glowing. One of top 2 books for the last year in this club.
5,"Authentic, compelling, entertaining","Water for Elephants is an exceptional read. The characters are well-developed and authentic, the story entertaining and enlightening, the writing and research first rate. All in all, a tremendous read. I can't imagine anyone who would not enjoy this book, I highly recommend."
4,Intriguing and different,"Not the usual popular high-end well-selling book. The info about that time in history, circuses, animals, vets, and people in and out of the circus is enchanting. A nicely crafted story, some violence, but in all a gentle read."
4,Very entertaining,"I picked up this book not knowing anything about the subject. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I found that a veterinarian was the main character. Very good book, kept me interested until the end."
4,Sweet story,Heartwarming story. What a life story to share. Makes me want to take the time to listen more to older people's stories.
3,Dirty but good,"I liked the story line, but the author put a lot of dirty things about a few of the characters that I didn't like.... It was a little too inappropriate for me! I will not be reading any other of her books."
1,I wish I had been warned about the language and sexual content,"I heard this was a wonderful movie, so I thought I would read the book. I got through a few pages and became disgusted with the language and content. Into the trash heap!"
1,Not my cup of tea,"I purchased this book based on the reviews. The book was full of animal abuse and human abuse. I was so disappointed in it and if you have a weak stomach with animal abuse, don't read it."
1,one of the worst movies I've ever read.,"I'm about half-way through this book and I'm giving up. It just can't hold my interest.It really is strange. When I read this book, I'm not transported to the world that the characters inhabit. I am transported to a movie theater, where I watch a film about the world the characters inhabit. Water For Elephants reads like the author was writing it with the sale of the movie rights in mind.Consider the following paragraph:""I do declare you're as strong as a horse,"" she says, writing one last thing down before flipping my chart shut. ""If you keep your weight up, I'll bet you could go on another ten years.""""Swell, "" I say.The entire book (well, the portion that I read) is filled with this movie-edit cliché dialog and stage direction.If you're interested in this story I would suggest saving yourself about six hours by watching the movie instead. I haven't seen it yet, but I imagine that they each have about the same amount of depth."
5,Circus from inside,"Great story, very interesting. Love story is so beautiful. You will just love the way this book takes to 1930's circus and shows you how it worked back then."
5,Review,"I love this book , it's very well written. If you are looking for a great read this is the story."
4,WONDERFUL,This book is outstanding. The details are fabulous and it's much lovlier than the movie. Would definitely read it again.
5,Great book!,Wasn't sure what to expect when this was recommended to me. Captivating story! I didn't want to put it down! Everyone should read this book.
5,Surprised me at how good it was,"The characters were good and funny- the old man made me LOL several times. I didn't know exactly what was going to happen until the very end. Reminded me a little of the Notebook, which I loved as well."
1,Laced with pornographic material,"I am truly baffled that so many folks rate this book 4 or 5 stars. I think the writing is cliched and weak. Although the circus has its share of salacious characters, the graphic, explicit sexual details are over the top and disgusting. If this book were to receive a movie rating system, I would give it an X. What has become of everyone that we accept, in the name of art, such explicit, kinky strange stuff, which, in my opinion, was gratuitous?Which brings me to this question, Why don't we have ratings on the back of every book, much like we have for movies. I would never in a million years allow my child, of any age under 18, read this. I wish I had been warned ahead of time. If you have a graphic memory like mine, or are offended by anything perverse, save your time and money."
1,Water for Elephants:A novel,"I had to drag myself through this book ntil I could no longer, and had to stop halfway.It is boring & redundant, don't believ all the hype"
2,water for elephants,"It is actually a waste of time and money! The plot could be very good, but filled with sensual and detailed pornographic material it could do without!"
2,Shipping,My entire order was messed up. I never received the item and I waited until the span of the shipping date was over until I contacted the seller. The seller said the item was shipped and that I would get a refund which I did. The seller was cooperative but I still wished I had received the item since this site is the only site where I can find the product cheap.
2,Like the Circus????,I found that the story with interest did not happen till the latter part of the book. I had just been to a tent circus---so i found it to b e an apprapo book to read.
2,"flat writing, not especially uplifting","I was given this book to borrow -- ""It is just a wonderful book."" I cannot stand mediocre writing, and for this reason I don't often read popular fiction. I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it."
5,Book,The book was received very promptly in excellent condition and I have enjoyed reading it very much.
2,very crude in some parts,I was hoping this was not like most modern day fiction when it came to crudeness... I will not be recommending it to my Christian friends...
2,Not Bad,I thought this book was a little slow. I wasn't really jazzed by it and thought the ending was weak.
2,Didn't catch my attention,"I didn't like the fact that it is written in the present tense. He he telling a story about what happened in the past so I felt like I was,reading a screen play."
3,Predictable but a good read,"You know how it will end... boy meets girl, conflict, boy gets girl... but well written and the backdrop of the Circus culture was very interesting."
2,Title Does Not Touch on Story,Very disappointing - if you are an animal lover - don't bother purchasing this book. I don't think I even got half way because of disturbing animal accounts.
5,Descriptive without being boring,"What a great book. When it was done, I wanted so much to have more to savor. The detail and descriptions impressed me in this book; they were so nicely done, without having boring detail. Covering two differenttimes of Jacob's life - as a young man, then as an older gentleman. Both funny and sad, and an enjoyable read."
5,A Stunning Tale,"I love this book! Not since reading The Kite Runner have I been so caught up in a story. The transitions from past to present are seamless and the suspense, color and history portrayed are powerful! Read it!"
5,Great book!!,"This book was very entertaining, it has a good love story in it. I liked this book a lot, glad I read it."
4,Very interesting,"I really enjoyed this book, but I wouldn't recommend a younger audience to read it. Characters are developed well and all of the loose ends are tied up nicely."
3,"Well written and witty, but just not that great.","This novel was very well written, flowing back and forth through time as if you were there with old Jacob. The read was simple and fun, but, in my opinion, lacked real depth and passion that I was expecting. As I read each chapter I expected a big bang, but there was none. The story was good, the read was easy and flowing, but the umph was missing for me."
5,Superb!,"A great read! Warm and wonderful storytelling. Character, color, and story: it's all here!Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER Push Not the River and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Against a Crimson Sky: A Novel"
4,good story,"I enjoyed this story because I work with geriatric patients and enjoy listening to the stories from their past. I thought the author did an excellent job recalling this gentleman's adventure. Who hasn't thought about what life would be like working in a circus. It certainly is a bygone era. If you like to lose yourself in an oldtimers tale, I believe you will enjoy this story."
4,Fantastic,"Water for Elephants was a fantastic book. Easy to read and interesting. Most impressively, a topic that I never gave much thought to, Depression-Era travelling train circuses, was something I enjoyed reading about. To be honest, I never knew there was such a topic. Now I'm wondering if there are any Industrial Revolution cat juggling books out there that I should be reading. Anyway, Gruen seemed to do a decent amount or research for the book, so I learned a little something about the topic. The best part of the book was the fantastic ending. More books should end like that."
4,A reluctant read,"When this book came out in hardcover, I passed it by. No interest in reading about circus freaks. When the book came out in paperback, I passed it by. Still did not sound interesting. Three people recommended it to me and then, finally, a friend gave it to me after she finished it. Still, I waited a month or so before beginning it. Within the first few chapters, I was intrigued. I loved the descriptions - created a definite picture in my mind. I loved the characters - I wanted to know what would happen to them. Although I thought the end was somewhat predictable, on the whole, I found this a very enjoyable read."
5,Life story,A reminder that life is as short as it is long. A great read full of ups and downs of a interesting life
4,Fun read,Awesome story. Very captivating and well written. Thank you to editor of the book as well. Always nice to read a well written well edited book!
3,Fast Read,"Gruen's book quickly invites you into the perspective of a 90 year old Jacob who eagerly awaits his opportunity to 'go to the circus' again. The story is an easy read about a tragic event that causes Jacob to join the circus. Circus life is what you would expect; colorful, hard, and rather bizarre. Our book club enjoyed the authors writing style that seemed to capture some of the essence of growing old while her interesting and realistic analogies. The book was a fast read but the ending was not realistic."
2,"Overrated, dry",This book was a quick read and a creative idea. But it was dry. It could and should have been elaborated on. It seemed as though the author was bored with writing it. Granted there were times of strong emotion but for the most part it was just lacking in all aspects.
5,Just read this,"This book is a grotesque fairytale. It's both charming and disturbing, and it will stay with you for a long time after you put it down."
5,Read it!,"Easy, quick read but a thoroughly engrossing ride. Definitely better than the film (which was OK, too). Glad I read it and have it on the shelf."
2,Disappointing,"Although well-written, I found this novel disappointing. I would've liked to hear more about the circus and it reminded me far too much of The Notebook."
5,Outstanding!!,"I loved this book! It was refreshing,well written, a real page turner. I would recommend this book for anyone over 15 who's looking for a good read."
1,Weakly written,A simple read. The characters lack substance and the story does not develop well. Unoriginal and disappointing. Goes to show that you can never judge a book by it's cover.
2,Cheesy tearjerker with a feel-good ending,"Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo."
3,an okay book,I hope the movie is more interesting then the book. It had its moments but if its price goes any higher on here I would recommend not bothering. It seemed a little generic.
5,Wonderful!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! It has so much to offer...disturbing moments, touching moments, REALLY interesting moments, dry-humor...and many of the accounts by ""Jacob"" are based on real-life stories from happenings of traveling circuses in the 20's-30's. I will probably read this again in a few months. Great read!"
4,Didn't know I liked it until I finished reading...,"While I recommend this book, the slow up-start did little to urge me further. However, by the time the key players are in place, the plot picks up and makes for a fascinating love story with a gritty kick. My only real complaint is that the main character felt foreign to me throughout the book, but he seems to come into his own by the conclusion. This book will make an excellent movie."
3,Depressing,"Depressing. Well written with so much detail I felt I was there at the circus. Unfortunately, that's the problem. It's set in the Depression. The horrible way the animals and workers were treated was too much for me to really enjoy the book. Very well written though, and I would read other books by this author."
3,Water for Elephants,"Everyone raved about this book.. I had a difficult time with the cruelty to people on the circus as well as the brutality to the animals.It was a good love story, though."
2,Didn't Enjoy,A friend I respect recommended this book. I read the whole thing with increasing irritation. Just like I was taught to finish everything on my plate I sometimes feel compelled to finish a book even though I am not enjoying it.I found the voice artificial and thus the whole story felt artificial. First person narration doesn't always work for me.
4,Entertaining (spoiler?),"As a person who usually reads non-fiction books about science and psychology, I thought I'd give myself a break and see what all the hype surrounding Water for Elephants was about. I was not disappointed. It was not the best book I've ever read, but it was very entertaining and a pretty quick read. I was explaining to someone that the story is very formulaic: guy wants girl, can't have girl, ends up getting girl - but it was set against a different backdrop than others. Sometimes that's exactly the kind of book you want to read."
5,"wow, amazing like you are there...very very good","I really cannot understand the bad reviews. This book is really good, the research amazing and the descriptions put you right THERE in the hobo camps, among the tracks, the dirt, poor workers and the wide broad differences between the performers and the grunts.I loved this book and the old mans' musings.. the ending was so awesome..I would give this 10 stars if i could.."
4,Very well written,"A well written story that held my interest to the end. If you're a sensitive animal lover as I am, some of this book may be hard, but it's worth the read. The ending seemed a bit rushed, but overall, I enjoyed the story."
4,Life in the Circus,"Sara Gruen's ""Water for Elephants"" is a one of those books that fascinate you with a look inside an unfamiliar world while entertaining you. The author is very adept at spinning a yarn, creating characters that spring to life in vibrant color, and setting up simultaneous storylines that build suspense and keep you interested. She is one of the best writer's I've read when it comes to inventing villains. I look forward to reading more by this author. On sheer writing ability, I would've given her five stars, but there were a couple of things in the story that put me off. I won't spoil it for others by pointing them out, and I would still highly recommend this book for its pure entertainment value."
4,Good book,"Well, I'll start off by saying that it is not for little kids. They do swear, there is sexual activity, but overall it was a very good book. I really liked it, and, what's even better is that it's free. I recommended this for people looking for a little excitement."
4,Good,"I really enjoyed this book despite having seen the movie first. The movie follows the book fairly closely without other sub plots that are usually omitted in movies. Definitely not adding a lot to the experience, though there are a few more characters."
5,a must read,"I saw part of the movie and knew I had to read the book. Once I started, it was hard to put down. The author's ability to to weave the past with the present is remarkable. It also shows what we could learn from the older generation if we would just listen."
5,I can't wait for the movie!,"Ok..movies never do a book justice it seems. But when reading this novel, I had to make myself slow down and relish it. And even then, I whipped though it, and I have been sad for days that it's over. Gruen did a remarkable and seamless job of going back and forth between the present day and the Depression era. I believe that if the right director gets ahold of this, we will see the likes of The Notebook or the The English Patient in film.Simply put, this was a great book. Read it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Interesting look at the circus world,"Although this is a work of fiction, author Sara Gruen did extensive research into the circus world during the Depression years. She weaves some real-life incidents into the story of Jacob Jankowski, a beloved only son who is well on his way to becoming a veterinarian. Shortly before he is due to graduate, his parents are killed in a car accident and he is left penniless. He accidentally climbs on a circus train and his fate is then sealed. Despite the fact that he has not finished his veterinary training, he is taken on as a circus vet. The story is told by Jacob when he is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and is waiting for his family to come and take him to the cicus. The book is interesting and creative, and is a very good read."
2,Disappointed!!,"For months, everytime I was in a bookstore - I found that I would gravitate toward this book, read the back and place it back on the shelf. I should have listened to my instinct. After many positive recommendations from friends and reading the reviews, I relunctantly check the book out at the local library. I started reading with an open mind. After about 200 pages, I phone my friend to ask her if I was missing something, because I just didn't care of the story and I couldn't seem to find a connection with any of the characters. At this point, she instructed me to stop reading - ""because of you don't like it now, there isn't anything earth shattering that will happen that will make you change your mind."" I didn't listen, and she was right."
5,wonderfully entertaining,"I read this in a week at the beach and it was so easy to get lost in the story. It is wild, but with so much heart, sprinkled with a little humor. Oh, and you will want a pet elephant when you are finished reading."
5,"Dreamy, heartwrenching and captivating.","This is one of my favorite books of all time and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie. This is a good book to give to someone to get them into reading. It's romantic and moves at a fast pace and has plenty of action. This book was full of visual imagery, it carried me away to each and every setting. I will definitely be reading this book again!"
4,Water for Elephants -- Great read!,Finished reading this book a couple of weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was an easy read with a consistent pace throughout. The author did a great job of letting the reader get to know both the young man and the old man at the heart of the story. I would definitely recommend this book to others.
2,Bad formatting for Kindle!!!,"The book is okay so far, but I'm very distracted by the horrible Kindle formatting. I've never had a problem with a Kindle book before, but this one is full of gaps and spacing problems. Dialogue is separated by abnormally huge gaps, but author-intended spaces intended to denote a pause are the same gaps as the extraneous ones; in other words, the intentional spaces are lost in the shuffle. This makes the book very hard to read and follow, since I'm never sure if it's a ""Kindle"" gap or an ""author"" gap. This was very poorly digitized. It almost makes the book unreadable because it is such a distraction."
3,"Great premise, great writing...but...","This book is very well written and well researched, but, I couldn't get through the passages of animal abuse...it sickened me...just my sensitivity I am sure.It was enough so I could not finish the book."
4,Better than I expected,"Never having been particularly interested in all things circus-y, I put this book back on the bookstore shelf more than once. But an Amazon review of another, quite unrelated novel referenced this book so I picked up a copy. Really glad I did. This is a well-paced novel that doesn't fall into the trap of doubling as a documentary on the early twentieth century circus trade. It is engaging, romantic, with sufficient drama and excitement to keep the pages turning over well into the night. Maybe at times a little cute, but a solid four-star effort."
5,Water for Elephants,This was a gift for our sons girlfriend. He is away and not able to send her a gift so asked us to do it
5,Very interesting,"I read this book about a year ago. I was a little unsure of the subject matter, however, the book pulled me in. I got very interested in the various characters, I found that it was one of my favorite books I read last year."
5,LOVED it!,"When the ending of a book makes me laugh triumphantly and yell, ""Yes!"" with tears in my eyes...that's a great story.What a great glimpse into what life must have been like in a time we've begun to forget. Loved it."
5,Magnificent in its simplicity,"Sara Gruen's novel ""Water for Elephants"" is the kind of novel most people read once in a lifetime. No matter what your age, from the first sentence you feel a sympathetic bond with the protagonists, as if it is your life that is mostly spent and what time you have left only short and bitter. From there on, you are transported to a better time full of hope, excitement, innocent virginity, and ultimate loss. I am envious of anyone who picks this up for the first time. Because after reading it, you will realize that the best times in your life haven't passed you behind - they've only laid the road for the course to come."
5,Excellent novel,"This novel made me want to meet someone who had worked on a circus before. The prologue is all I read in the store and I immediately felt the need to buy it because of the mystery. The book is filled with exciting storylines that will capture your attention and keep it there throughout the story--hoping that the storyline will end as you hoped.When you get to the part in the book that the prologue mentions, the actual outcome will surprise you. The animals all find a way into your heart and the characters are all worth remembering and holding on to. I recomend this book for anyone interested in historical fiction or even science fiction because while it revolves around reality, a cirus, the way that it is written almost feels like science fiction."
5,Loved it!,I'd been seeing this book pop up on amazon as a recommended read for such a long time and kept resisting reading it. I didn't watch the movie either. I finally gave in to see what all the hype was about and I couldn't put this book down! It was one of the best books I've read in a long time! It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I loved it!
5,"great, quick read","really enjoyed reading this book...fast and interesting read! I've referred it to many and they too enjoyed it, you will too!"
2,nice for the beach,"Whoever recommended this book as a good beach read is correct. Those who claim to find great depth in it are mistaken. This story is lacking in authenticity; neither the actions nor the emotions are believable, and the elephant-keeping, as described, is insane. The author claims that many of the events in this book actually happened, but having them all occur in the space of three month puts them in the realm of fantasy. When author describes her research for this novel, it sounds like research for a term paper, and a term paper-novel sums up its quality very well. It's fun for the beach, but if you're looking for a serious novel, don't bother."
2,Well Researched,"Sara Gruen did exhaustive research for her novel, Water for Elephants. But all went for naught to this reader. The story never became real to me. The characters were pasteboard figures. I was aware of the author too much, behind the scenes, pulling the levers. It seemed like a very ""American"" book- for people with short attention spans.All in all, characterization was thin; narrative was thin, and the whole experience of reading the novel did not transport me to another world."
2,Ham Sandwich,"Easy going down and eminently forgettable. Not a bad effort by Ms. Gruen by any means, but a substantial amount of the book is given to cliched, obvious writing (both in language and character). The general premise is enjoyable, however; who doesn't like the circus? Reading ""Water for Elephants"" is like watching a movie on cable - odds are that you've already seen it, you know where it's going, but it's still a decent way to pass some time."
1,Please tell me why this is a best-seller?,"This was a frustrating, truly awful book. While it started off interesting (a boy's parents dies and leave him nothing, and he gets caught up with a circus), it quickly became transparent and painful. He ""falls in love"" with a girl he hardly speaks to, who is married. He reacts when he should hold back and holds back when he should act. And there are far too many random, explicit, and unnecessary sex scenes. Perhaps if the author spent less time on graphic sex and more time on character development, this book would have been more tolerable. And the ending, which I was hoping would earn the book some redemption, was terribly disappointing and infuriating.My faith in the NY Times bestseller list has been ruined."
4,An entertaining circus story,"I've actually read this book twice--once because some friends recommended it, and then a few years later I read it again when the movie came out. I thought the story was fascinating about a young man whose veterinary education is interrupted and he hops a circus train. He becomes the circus vet and his whole life changes. Of course this all happens during the Great Depression. I guess I liked this book because of the background research by the author about circuses during that period. The old photos were charming as well. Like another reviewer mentioned not all of the facts regarding the care of animals may have been accurate but it's a fictional story and I think you have to give some license to that. It's a book you would take on the plane or to the beach just to enjoy!"
1,DA CREW,"sorry, but this is not the real da crew. it is just a copy off of ours. please redirect yourself to this site for an accurate representation of da crew:www.myspace.com/dacrew1"
3,Handle Hurts Hand,"These are great to use in your room when your baby is new or if you have more than one level in your house. My son sleeps well in it. The changing table is really nice too. It is easy to set up and take down.Unfortunately, they are not easy to travel with. I have flown alone with my son several times and the handle hurts my hand when I carry it. It has even given me blisters before. It would be really nice if they would improve the handle or add wheels to it."
2,Cheaply made,"These footed pajamas are of poor quality. The stitching has pulled out, they don't wash well, the bottom of the footing is cheap looking - basically, not the quality that I was hoping for. I would recommend footzies or piggies which are of much better quality by direct comparison."
2,Not so great,"The item looks smaller in pictures than it really is. Definitely not for beginners in the rear, due to size. Also the vibe that came with it worked for about 20 seconds and quit. May have just gotten the one that missed quality control, but be careful since it's a non-returnable item."
1,Nivea Body Oil,"I have used Nivea Original Body Oil for the past 30 years, but now the company has discontinued making it. I don't care at all for the Creamy Conditioning version at all. I want the ORIGINAL formula to come back. Does anyone know where I can get some?"
2,not a great nailfile,"This file works faster than an emery board or diamond file, but it is too coarse - it tends to snag your nails at certain angles."
4,The file I received was fine but it's not this one,"I was looking for a file that would knock off the rough edges of my fingernails after I cut them. I did a little research and decided to order the Debra Lynn 8"" Triple Cut Nail File. The file I received (please see the pictures above) is in fact an 8"" stainless steel triple cut nail file sans the plastic handle and with a notch cut into it for grip. I did a little digging and found out that it is actually a BURMAX file (Model 130928315).Don't get me wrong, it's a nice enough file. It's stainless. The quality is pretty decent and it does what it's supposed to do so I won't return it or ding the rating. However, my quick Internet search turns up the fact that this particular file sells in lots of 500 for .51 cents a piece (or just slightly more than the $6.42 I paid for this one...).As always, caveat emptor."
2,Triple Cut Nail File,"I'm disappointed in this purchase because I was expecting something different. I've been looking for a fingernail file that I purchased years ago. I've never been able to find one like it. Several people who purchased this file said they had the same experience and were so happy to finally find this file. The reviews sounded just like what I was looking for. The file I'm trying to replace is slender and more flexible than the one I received. Both sides are straight and the one I received has a crescent shape on one side. The biggest difference is that the file is so coarse. It's like a file out of my husband's tool box! It tears up your fingernails and your skin. The old one did the job but was much softer and finer. The one I received has a stamp on the handle ""Stainless Steel Burmax"". To make matters worse, I was so sure I'd found the right file, I purchased two. Oh well, I guess that's the chance you take when you order online."
2,Micro metal file,"This file is nice and long but the cross cut sucks, it would be perfect for preparing horse huffs before shoeing."
5,Hard to find,"Hard to find metal files in stores that are of this quality. Both and gave on to all of my sisters, brother, mother and even my brother in law wanted one. Great product."
1,Just plain bad,This movie.....SUCKS!!!! it's by far the worst movie i have ever seen! never have I found such a worst movie from teh streets of friscos china..china town...
3,HOOKS OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL,"I purchased these hooks for the Calphalon Pot Rack (20"" x 20"" Square - Hanging) I got from E-bay in hopes they would be the same as the ones that came with the rack. Well, they're not! These hooks are polished aluminum or could be stainless steel, not specified on the package, but they are shiny and not matte. The hooks that I needed are of a matte finish. If anyone knows if the other hooks advertised on Amazon for Calphalon pot racks are a matte finish, please post."
1,Metal doesn't match,"I recently purchased a stainless steel Calphalon Pot Rack. I needed a couple of extra hooks, so I purchased these, since they are made by Calphalon and they look like the stainless steel hooks which came with the rack. Wrong! They look almost the same, but the disappointing part is they are made of aluminum instead of stainless steel. They look terrible on a rack where every component is polished stainless except for these two hooks???"
5,Great part of the system,"These hooks are a great part of the Calphalon system. They lock in place and are very easy to move around, even with pans on them"
1,Over priced,$4.00 a hook is crazy. I bought a ten pack of hooks for a $1.00 at a very large home store which is located world wide. That's 40 times less. They aren't the same as these but I'm hanging a pot for heavens sake not a 55 inch t.v.
1,Elvis Blue Suede Shoes Men's Deluxe Cruiser Bike,I didn't receive this product -- out of stock. I'm still interested though if you should stock them again.
1,TERRIBLE,THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE IT IS ABOUT A GUY WHO BUYS A SEX DOLL AND TOTALLY FLIPS OUT ON THIS WOMAN WHOM HE CREATED THE DOLL TO LOOK JUST LIKE. I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE.
3,Oddball but interesting flick,"I add my voice to the others that ranked this film as unique but odd. It's a story about love -- very stilted love -- that turns into a horror film and ends in a twist of irony. I think the producer and director had very clever ideas when they created this movie, which is low budget and has no stars.If you like unusual fare or horror, there's probably something in this movie for you. If you like mainstream Hollywood movies or disdain blood and guts, you probably won't find much humor or irony in this movie.So, got for it adventurers and enjoy a one of a kind entertainment."
2,objectionable love,"I found this movie intriguing from the start, with bits of dark humor, and suspected parody challenging my thoughts and stimulating the senses. Unfortunately the movie takes a very dark turn near the end of the story, creating an altogether different feel from the previous sections. Brutal implications and an attempted ironic ending that felt cynical instead, left me unsatisfied and wanting a rewrite for the end."
2,Um...,This movie has a scene with a beeping alarm clock about every 15 minutes. Perhaps this was intentional to keep audiences from dozing off. I know I would have otherwise slept through it.
2,adequate at best,"most of the hikes listed are widely found in many other sources. thse that were unique, had vague descriptions and were very difficult to find (i.e. bad descrptions to trailheads). all in all, a dissappointment."
2,The Audio Equivalent of Prozac,"""Eleven Love Songs"" could not even keep an insomniac awake--this is one sleepy recording. And quite frankly, I felt it was the audio equivalent of Prozac. The level that this music does work on is as background music or a cure for insomnia (if being bored to sleep can be considered a cure), but for up-front listening, there was nothing that made me want to pay attention to the music for very long.Marquez does get a dark sound, but there's a side of me that wishes she would cut something with a little excitement to it. All of the tracks on this album run at the same slow pace, there is not even a single uptempo tune to act like a mild dose of caffeine amidst the sleepiness.She seems like a decent vocalist, and I know she does have potential, but the subject matter just makes the whole thing rather empty and uninteresting to me. Some of the previous reviews are so overly enthusiastic one might think that Marquez herself wrote them."
5,Haven't used it yet,"It's a well known brand and has always been reliable. You can use it for many different applications, not just turkey or chicken. Goes great with pork too."
2,Not sure if does anything,My massage therapist swears by it. I don't really notice anything from using it.
3,Not big enough,I agree with the other reviewer-these bags are not easy to seal. The bags would be perfect if they were longer so you could tie the knot easier. I really like how thick they are and they do seem to keep the odor in if you manage to seal it well. Not sure if I'll spend the extra money to buy more of these.
5,"Great Bag, Better Price!","I purchased this pack with the intentions of using it for work. My son saw it and immediately thought it was for him. The bag is big and I can fit just about everything in there. I can't imagine what my son can possibly put in there..his phone, wallet and ipod which he can easily put in his pants pockets. Made well, roomy with lots of compartments and it looks nice on. I saw this pack on another site and it was almost doubled the price so this was a good deal. And yes, I gave in and gave it to my son."
4,Cleansing the sensitve,"The is the one product, perhaps the only product my wife can use without fear a skin breakout. It cleans while refreshing the skin."
5,"Excellent, Fast Service for Noxzema Sensitive","I have been using Noxzema Sensitive for many years.Since the end of 2004, Noxzema Sensitive has become very hard to find in Virginia. I have been searching here and there for it, but have been unsuccessful.Recently, I found Amazon.com. This website was an answer to my prayers. Not only did I find the price of the product inexpensive, shipping is fast also. Within four days of ordering Noxzema, it was at my door step!I am very impressed with the fast service and will be ordering more things from Amazon.com in the future.Thanks!"
3,One great section out of three,"This is a nice little tool, and remarkably useful even for D&D products several generations down the road. Easily the most relevant section today is ""Book III: Adventure Cookbook,"" which is a fun brainstorming tool for getting adventure and campaign ideas flowing. The DM rolls dice for theme, setting, villain and various plot points, and the results, although random, often amount to the beginnings of a promising adventure. The charts and forms in the first two books are a little overcomplicated for my taste, but they could still generally be used with third-generation-era D&D. Note that there is basically nothing here on overall world-design. Included is a module with some fun ideas."
2,"A couple good ideas, but overall not very worthwhile","There were a few good ideas in here, but they also had a lot of junk and old-school, grimtoothesque random murder of players for no apparent reason, weak design material."
1,disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. I did not find it encouraging at all.....as a matter of fact....I found it more pro for the stepkids and bio fathers. I was looking for a book that would allow me to feel okay that I don't feel certain ways as a stepmother and I was looking for encouraging words to make me feel that I did not have to have the pressure on me as a stepmother and to feel that I was not expected to do all the compromising. I did not find it helpful and I discarded the book.
3,"""Have I Ever Told You"" CD","Altho the CD has good music, it skip in places and the music changes levels while playing."
5,"FFH's best, hands down.","This is FFH's strongest album by far. Jeromy Deibler's songwriting has reached new levels and these songs sparkle under the care of producers Scott Williamson and David Hamilton.I disagree to a certain extent with those who call this album a clone of the first two. Although the trademark FFH sound is certainly present, it is clearly evident that the producers have taken some new approaches to the music and vocal arrangements. The group has definitely, in my opinion, taken a confident step forward with this project.If you want to hear creative, musical, heartfelt Christian songs with top-notch production, you'll find it here."
5,BROTHERS! DON'T LET THE $ PRICE $ FOOL YA!!!,"I KNOW I WAS AMAZED WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF THIS EXTREMELY-LOW-PRICED CHORUS PEDAL. I didn't know the price till after a bandmate was playing thru one, so I went to purchase one right away and said: WOW!!! Sure,I'll Steal this fine item from you, If your gonna force-me! hahahaha! Besides Great Sound, it Looks Vintage/Classic/Cool...It's Like the 57'Chevy,or Buick Skylark of guitar-pedals! Just tryin'-2-help a brother out. Especially in these financially-tough-times!"
2,Nice Little Toy,"Well, it's cute, but you don't want to jam or even practice with it.All I can say is, don't buy it for practice reasons. Maybe for a youngster that is 1st starting out, but then if he or she practices with this pedal, it may encourage not to play music. Yep, that's how bad it is.It is heavy duty except for the knobs. Yuk Yuk"
5,a great program overall....,"The program basically covers the entire psychology of our minds, sticks it on 7 DVDs and then fires it into our brains. This isn't a quick fix program to help your dating and it might seem like it's often not that related. However, its intention is to make you into a much more mature, confident, happy man who knows exactly how to achieve what he wants. This is the sort of guy who will naturally be far more attractive to women.I've always been a 'thin-skinned' person who easily gets his buttons pushed, finds it hard to say no and be assertive. I've also been plagued by a lot of anxiety, self-doubt and depression about my progress with life. This program offers very real and workable solutions to all of my problems. If you've ever been affected by any of these problems even a tiny bit you can use this program to fix them.I think every guy could benefit strongly from using this program and really working with the material every day."
3,*Avril Lavigne*,"This CD is okay. It's a single so it only has a few songs. My favorite is ""Why"", which isn't on the Let Go album and doesn't sound as pop as some of Avril's other songs. It has Complicated, which we've all heard before. I don't like this song too much probably cause it's always on the radio. ""I Don't Give"" is the bonus track off Let Go. It's got a very pop sound to it and is a bit repetitive. If you really want these songs my advice is to just buy Let Go and download ""Why""."
1,Boring and overrated.,"Avril Lavigne's hit song, ""Complicated"" is so boring and overrated. I'll admit that the first few times I heard it, I was impressed. Now it really is starting to get tiring. The more I hear it, the less I tend to like it. I don't really like Avril all that much, either. I hate her attitude and personality. She doesn't really have a good voice, either, come to think of it. The other two songs on this CD single, I was not impressed with, either. In ""Complicated"", Avril sings about how people often change their images when they are hanging out with other people...trying to ""act cool"". I guess the lyrics are OK, but the song isn't. It could've been an OK song, but it's by Avril Lavigne.Score:50/100F-"
4,Noisy for Office Work,"I don't play games. I suppose noise is not much an issue with games as they have sound.But if you use it for office work, the noise is a bit too loud. The noise is constantly at its highest level, unlike some cards that slow down the fan if the video card is not working heavily.Compared with analogue, the digital output does give you clear, sharp text and better picture. If your monitor have digital input, you should get a card that supports it. The difference is big in my opinion.For office work, I suggest you to get a fanless graphics card like e-GeForce 7100GS. I am however suprised that EVGA does not clearly point out that 7100GS is fanless."
4,Works as intended,The first one did not work after installing the drivers. Amazon customer service was excellent and it was easy to do a return by using their website to print the shipping label. The second one arrived immediately and it did not have any problems. We don't use this for a gaming system and it serves the purpose well.
2,"Dropped Ranking of Vista ""Windows Experience Index""","Put this into Intel motherboard DG965OT with builtin graphics GMA X3000 and this card dropped the ""Windows Experience Index"" for Vista, specifically for ""Desktop performance for Windows Aero"". Builtin ranked it at 3.8."
1,Terrific Shoe,"The shoe is most comfortable, broke in quickly and fits like a glove. A bit better picture of the product would have helped get a better sense of the style."
4,passat,"this book is quite comprehensive. one problem: non USA passat owners may have monojetronic fuel injection, this is not covered. the 1.8 litre engine is also not covered, only the 2 litre."
2,1993 Wagon is a Piece of Crap,I purchased this to do work on my garbage 1994 Wagon. The 1994 wagon is a cross between 1993 and 1995 unfortunately so I had a difficult time fixing the vehicle. This book did not provide proper assistance and as there is no material for 94 from VW I had to risk purchasing this product. Luckily I sold the piece of crap.
2,Nice construction..........inexplicable sizing.,"I bought these from a closeout site (Bargain Outfitters) through Amazon.The price was right: $43.83 (including shipping)The quality was fine: 200 gram Thinsulate insulated Dunham boots, a good all-around value boot.The size was WAY OFF!!: It stated a 4E size (EEEE in other words, for wide-footed fools like myself). Only, when I tried to get these on (with skinny socks) they wouldn't budge. These felt more like a narrow fit than a EEEE.I bought these with an amazon visa reward, the balance being absorbed by the visa. Shipping these back w/ insurance would have cost almost as much as the reward. I decided to give them to a narrow footed friend instead.Moral of the story: When buying shoes online, always look for a free return policy, or at least be sure of the fit of the shoe (in a store trial, or a brand that historically fits your type). Otherwise, you'll be in for a headache.....from tight fitting boots."
5,Great Item,Great Item - Easy to Install - Nice to be able to see the temperature right on your thermostat.
3,works well,"The Honeywell C7089U1006 Outdoor Temperature Sensor was easy to hook up and install, but a little more $$ than I really should have paid, I put this in when I installed the new programmable thermostat. Now I have a reference to the outside temp at the thermostat. I don't know if they make a compatible cordless remote, which would be easier, but this one, so far seems accurate and operable. Plan on splicing the contact lines, however, as the leads are only 6 feet long"
2,Concerned about the Calibration,"I checked resistance out of the box against reference temperatures and calibration was off by 1-3 deg. C. The error is not linear, below -20C it reads 1-2 deg C colder and above zero it is reading 1-2 deg warmer. It not cost effective to return it because the refund of canadian inport duty and taxes is a hassel."
4,Honeywell C7089U1006 Outdoor Temperature Sensor,This is a must have for the IAQ thermostat. It's easy to install and accurate. If not for the price it would be rated a 5 .
4,Works but too short.,"I had to buy some extra wire to run it outside, but overall it works good. I would recommend it."
4,Apple Jacks Cycling Jersey,Bought this jersery a couple of years ago. It still looks like new. A bit warm for 100 degree plus weather. This one did not have a hidden zipper for valuables. It get a lot of comments. Someone always yells out Apple Jacks. Provides great visibility in traffic. Highly recommend. I think the sizes run a little small.
1,CUTE AS A JOKE,Poorly made ... wore less than 10 times ... already falling apart. More for a joke than actually practical slippers.
4,They were great,"They were a perfect gag gift! Didn't come on time but, it was the holidays and lots of bad weather."
2,Wonderful depiction of island life,Brought to life the ways of island people making their subsistence from the lake and the land. It cannot be truly appreciated without a visit to this pristine spot along the Great Lakes. Many citations of families that settled among the Mormons.Lacks specifics of stories regarding the stories of families fleeing out of fear.
3,Characters with Stubborness,"Not much action packed like I am use to. I did love the story. The determination that Cougar had to get what he wanted. I love that in a guy. Stubborness in both characters was well placed and written. I love Sarah McCarty's books but I am just now getting into the Promise series. The descriptions in the book makes you really see what is going on. You can picture it in your mind. It is great to be able to do that, for me anyways. If I cannot understand or picture the scene then I cannot get into it.Cougar and Mara's stubborness bounces off each other. Making the tension fly higher. There was times while I was reading I wished I could reach in there and shake them."
5,AN INCREDIBLE BOOK!,"Another superbly written story by Sarah McCarty! Cougar and Mara get together under less than honorable circumstances, but find a way to make things work despite all the obstacles standing in their way. PROMISES KEEP is a wonderful, spell-binding story that will have you turning page after page in anticipation of what comes next. I am a HUGE fan of Ms. McCarty's work as she always pulls me into her stories with her meticulously woven characterization. I am anxiously awaiting the next installment in the ""Promises"" series."
4,"Sexy, Charmin' Cowboy","Sarah McCarty has done it again another cowboy with heart and soul to make any woman weak in the knees lucky, lucky Mara."
2,Get some new material Sarah please!,"I just couldn't get through this book it was sooo boring. I don't understand why so many people rave about Sarah McCarty's books, their all the same; same dialogue, same alpha male with a different name, same boring heroines. I love a good erotica novel as well as the next female, but I think I'll pass on Sarah McCarty in the future she's just doesn't come up with original chracters and storylines from one novel to the next."
2,Not what I expected,"I read about this author and was looking forward to reading this book. It's hard to believe this book was written by a female, the sex scenes where from a male point of view.I expected him to be kind and help her to recover, it felt like he was nasty during the sex scenes, physically abusive at times. And she loved it? The girl who was raped and so unsure of herself? And she keeps finding him in bed with someone else, but that's OK? Please!I didn't buy the premise, I bought the entire series and this book arrived first, after the investment I paid I hope the other books are better."
4,"Por favor comprendeme, tipos de caracter y temperamento.","Libro muy bueno para tenet en cuenta en el desarrollo personal, empresarial y espiritual del liderazgo."
5,Nivea Anti-Wrinkle & Firming creme for $99?!,"Please! I've been using this cream for the last 8 years at least and buying it at Walgreens for $10 tops.All of a sudden, a year or so ago it was completely off the shelves. Last year I had to come to Amazon and a few other places to buy it for the same price as it had been, but it was more inconvenient because I had to have it shipped.But now? You're still selling it, however for $99 instead of the standard $10!Wow, what a difference. What has happened that you are now charging so much for something that's not worth more than a basic bottle of Oil of Olay?And then I noticed that you're selling a combination Nivea pack for over $200??!! Come on guys, that is robbery."
2,Is the price wright?,I have bought many of these cremes for around $10.00.Is this a misprint or what!
5,Nivea visage is fabulous,"I have been using this Nivea moisterizer for a long time. I love its texture and fragrance, as well as the SPF factor. Thank goodness I can still get it online.. thank you American Beauty."
3,"Great, but it's still a textbook.","I should say up front that I just don't really like textbooks. This book is a great introduction for someone new to psychology who works with adolescents. For someone who has taken several psychology courses, this book is repetitive, shallow, and general. It casts a wide net. Fortunately, my instructor brought in lots of interesting supplementary journal articles and encouraged debate. Otherwise I might have died of boredom. I'm keeping this book around as a reference, because the problems it has are really just symptoms of textbooks in general. As far as textbooks go, this one is as good as the others."
2,Wrong book,"The book came quickly and in great condition, it was just a little frustrating that I searched specifically for the 9th edition and the photo provided was of the 9th but then I received the 7th edition. This was probably overlooking some how on my part but I both searched the edition specifically and made sure the covers matched but there was still a mix up. Hopefully 2 additions doesn't dramatically change the content!"
4,interesting,"the book is interesting. it focuses on different times in adolescence and different experiments that have been done. all in all, it's a pretty good buy."
2,"Uh, er, whatever...","I found out about BG after I recently got into Iced Earth and saw many comments from people saying that BG was even better than IE. Well, I've listened to them both and all I have to say is ""My A$$."" Blind Guardian is okay at best. Not bad, but not really that good. Most Iron Maiden is better.It just felt really silly, as if a group of vikings/knights/Robin Hood and his merry men picked up guitars and starting playing metal. It just felt goofy. None of the intensity that I like in Iced Earth (Not to mention IE's vastly superiour singer). It all feels vert dated and the production values are cheap, like the ""orchestra"" parts? I've heard MIDI files that were more stirring.A few decent songs, but nothing that will stay in my CD player for very long."
5,Great CD,I heard of Blind Guardian about four months ago. I bought this album yesterday and I can't stop listining to it. This is my second album from Blind Guardian and I'm certain their music will live forever.
3,"Pretty good, but there's better Hed Kandi out there","I've been a fan of Hed Kandi's Beach House and Stereo Sushi series. I bought this because I've had luck with with Hed Kandi and I liked the idea of a live house mix. It's not great, but it's not bad. I agree with another reviewer who said you're not going to find a particular track you like. It's good background music, but if you want to sit and enjoy an album, this one will give you a headache. Some tracks are just too long and monotonous (hence why it might be good as background music). I suggest purchasing a cd from one of the series I mentioned above."
4,Another nice offering from the Hedkandi crew,"even with a different crew, the music is as funky as ever, although i do kind of miss Jason Brooks' artwork which gave the Kandi girls their own personalities... but hey, they're only cartoons."
2,Hed Kandi lite... ???,"Bought this cd on the Hed Kandi rep and to get a new remix of that awesome track 'Fade' by Solu Music... In the past even if you didn't like 'em all there were some tracks that would drill holes in ya... This compilation is Wonder Bread - pretty limp... Even the Fade Remix is lame... YO! find someone that 'feels' the music, and not just what you think will penetrate the demographic target! If this is what they're dancin' to in Paris they need to change their meds!"
3,Just okay,"Maybe I was misunderstood the purpose of this film, but it was just okay. Actually, I wanted to fast forward through parts but I stuck it out."
2,paris is burning...,"If you like vintage documentaries, that are sad, because you know everyone is pretty much dead now, then tbis one is for you"
2,Poor imitation of Sing Star,"I am from the UK, but we have a US play station for when we come to the States. I had to buy the US equivalent of Sing Star, but unfortunately Karaoke Revolution is nowhere near as much fun as Sing Star. I will not be purchasing any more Karaoke Revolution games. Hopefully they will bring out a US version of Sing Star."
4,Fun Times Ahead,This is a great game! It has a lot of fun songs to sing and it has provided me with many hours of entertainment. I gave it a rating of 4 because it just falls short of the Karaoke Party Revolution.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mix of the old and new.
4,Comparing the Original to Volume 3,"My Daughter's Review: In this game, you will ether select ""single player"" or ""multi player."" If you choose ""multi player,"" you select the number of players, then, you choose the number of rounds, then, you choose the song - one for each player - choose where you want to sing - then play. Overall I prefer the original because it's less complicated. I also like being able to mix n' match the outfits - and I like the music better."
3,Songs by decade,"Too bad they don't make a bundle of songs dedicated to a specific decade (60's, 70's etc.). It is a great game , but so far, people only seem to know about 4 songs well enough to sing."
1,NOT for dancing,"I purchased this for my son based on the demo that came with DDR. Regrettably, this does NOT allow you to use the DDR dance mat. I spent $50.00 for a game and now he uses the mic only for the DDR karaoke demo. Very disappointing."
4,Karaoke Revolution V3 - Great for the whole family.,This game was a lot of fun for the whole family. The characters are comical and have their own personalities. The game's a favorite for visiting friends and for parties. I only wish that it included more songs. Can't wait for V4 which is supposed to come out in November and be both more customizable and have more songs.
1,awful book,"honestly, the worrrrrst book ever. the research in this book is terrible. i can really tell that kirsten is a bad author. nice try."
4,My Son Loves This Truck!,"We actually bought this truck after Christmas with a gift card he received, it wasn't something he asked for, it just looked cool. Now he is in love with Monster Trucks! He loves this thing, he uses it to run over his other cars, he drives it up the couch and table, and plays with it for hours on end. Now we are looking to find more 1:24 scale trucks to go with it. Very durable and lots of fun!"
4,Too expensive to ship,This is a great product for your cats extremely light and dust free however it cost too much to have this shipped without a prime or similar arrangement.
4,New cat litter saved the day !!!,My cat has been slowly losing fur off his belly for the past 6 months and nothing that the vet prescribed has helped... I read online that the clumping cat litter can cause fur irritation and over-licking by the cat. Since using the Cedar Chips my cat has a downy fuzz growing back and his skin seems less sore and more natural in color.Thanks !
4,Useful,"While imperfect (lacking chapter, verse, etc. to compare with other translations), this volume is excellent. I use it all the time in my Dharma Talks in the US Army. It is concise, readable, comprehensible, and easily explains the central tenets of Buddhism. Though I wish it were broader in terms of material, for what it is, it is hard to ask for more."
2,A weak thesis that goes undefended,"The thesis of this book is that math can't be truly understood through language. The language of mathematics is numbers, and it can only be truly understood through numbers.While that is true, language is an effective means of teaching people how to think about the numbers. Also, despite Frank Smith's thesis, he spends almost the entire book using language rather than numbers to explain mathematics. I would say he proves his own thesis wrong, except he doesn't explain mathematics that well, either.It did get me thinking about math in terms of how the numbers interact, vaguely, because he stated that. That helped a little, even if he didn't elaborate on how exactly one should think about math in terms of numbers rather than language. That's why I give it an extra star.Skip onto something more truly informative."
2,"Cute chair, but not very durable","We ordered this chair and the green frog chair for our boys' playroom. Now granted, we have two active boys, ages 2 and 8 at the time, but this Elephant chair lasted just over a month before it began to fall apart. Literally. The stitching started to come out, followed by the bars that held up the arms. It was completely unusable within two months. The frog, I should say, has held up wonderfully, so try a different animal."
1,Poor fit and quality.,"Ripped and was fraying minutes into wearing it. One time use. Hard to adjust neckline string. But, the price does refer to it quality."
2,Waste of $20.,"I ordered this shirt for Halloween, and also with the idea of wearing to ren fairs. The size they say is XL; its not. Its a one size fits all. When I got it out of all the packaging it was very stiff and smelled very strongly of old melted plastic to the point of causing me to gag. So I washed it to get the smell out in my washer. BIG mistake. It caused the shirt to shrink, which wasn't to bad for me because I'm small anyway. If you need this shirt to remain the same size I would either hand wash and line dry or have it professionally cleaned. In the picture it looks like its a white but it's not it's more of a yellow-white linen color. I might only get one or 2 uses out of this shirt because it's also seems to be fraying and the seems are coming undone. If you're going to buy this shirt because it does look realistic plane to only get a few uses out of it."
4,Great shirt!,"My husband and I recently went to a costume party dressed as pirates. This was a great shirt for the price and it served its purpose well. The material is a little thin so he wore a t-shirt underneath. If he never uses the shirt again, it was well worth the money."
5,Another Szell classic,"George Szell has been very well served in Sony Classical's reissues on SACD of classics from its back catalogue. This is another gem, comprising three of the great tone poems of Richard Strauss, as conducted by one of the greatest exponents of his orchestral music on record.As with the others in this series, Sony's untampered DSD transfer lets us hear all of the musical information on the original master tapes, without any artificial noise reduction or processing. The high frequency notes and wide dynamic range which are so much better on SACD than conventional CD serve this music well. There is so much more to be heard than on the recent CD transfers and infinitely more than on the original LP. You can hear every bit of the orchestral texture in these complex scores, and the recordings are so realistic that you can even hear Szell vocalizing and audibly urging on his forces! Very highly recommended."
5,Good choice for an absolute beginner,"I find this book well-written and friendly to people who have not been exposed to algorithmic ideas. Biologists who are keen to understand algorithms that underpin all bioinformatics softwares will get a good dose of confidence after reading this book. To get the best out of this book a reader should test the algorithms explained in the book using a familiar programming language. Experienced people looking to ""level-up"" their expertise are likely to be disappointed - this is definitely a book for beginner / intermediate level folks."
3,Here's my problem...,"This pan presents a conundrum. First, when grilling, the goal is to cook at as high a heat as possible. At least, that's how I like it. You still can't get your stovetop burners as hot as a charcoal grill, but you can certainly get it quite hot. The problem I have had is that when I cook at high temps, food sticks, even to the ""nonstick"" surface. It surely is easier to clean than a ""sticky"" surface, but at least those you don't have to worry about scratching the surface. The food, however, turns out just fine, and like all Calphalon, the pan's temperature control and evenness are excellent due to the conductivity of the aluminum. A side issue is that the underside of the Professional Nonstick II line appears excessively susceptible to stains and marks. The Commercial Nonstick line does not have this problem. I also believe the Commercial Nonstick line has a somewhat more advanced nonstick coating (Calphalon discusses this briefly on its web site).Happy cooking!"
2,Results mediocre - has almost no good grill pan features,"Nice quality pan, as with all of the Nonstick II products. However, Calphalon shouldn't have even bothered to make this grill pan. STRENGTHS: easy cleanup, durable pan; WEAKNESSES: flat ridges don't raise the food to get hot air circulation and get it out of the oil, round shape is a bad choice for trying to fit 4 pieces of meat, and the nonstick finish produces almost no browning - sort of unappetizing. ""Cooking Light"" magazine reviewed many grill pans and did not recognize this as one of the better ones. Features they recommend looking for (and I can vouch for these!): square shape, high cooking surface ridges, high sides to keep in heat, and ANY finish other than nonstick."
3,Star Trek religions,"This is a well written and informative book but it is written by college professors and it shows. At times it reads more like a textbook than it should. I have read all the (fill in the blank) of Star Trek books, physics, ethics, computers, etc. All of them were a better read than this."
3,Not for oily skin,"I bought this as a couple people said it should be a good night cream for oily skin since it's light. However, it's really not light. It feels greasy and thick on my face, even though I just use a tiny dab. I can still feel it on my face when I wake up. I also don't think it did much to help my skin. If you have dry skin and aren't prone to breakouts and don't have any fine lines yet, this might be a good cream, but not for me."
3,Not so light,"I really wanted a very light night cream. I'm sure this mosturizes well but it left a residue that was still present the next morning. I tried it again and again, using less each time until I was putting the merest suggestion of cream on my face - no longer enough to even begin to moisturize. Reluctantly I took this off my subscription list and won't buy it again.But I do realize this is a preference thing. For some people - different age, different skin, different preferences - it might be wonderful. Certainly it seemed well blended and was fragrance free as described. For me, it came out probably one or two stars. But I'm giving it three because I think it's a nice enough product - just not for me."
5,The BEST AND Least Expensive Moisturizer on the Market,"I use this both night AND morning and have never experienced a break out, rash, or any such thing. I used to use Clinique oil-free ""moisture in control"" because I would frequently break out. While I didn't break out after using it, my skin didn't feel moisturized, and after turning 40 that is key. I've been using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for over a year and love that it also contains few ingredients, no fragrance and NO sunscreen. Personally I don't like the idea of rubbing sunscreen into my face every morning, especially when I don't spend much time outside during the day. So I recommend giving this a try for both morning and night applications for sensitive skin. It makes my skin soft and moisturized but never greasy feeling. I use this in conjunction with Regenerist for sensitive skin."
2,It clogs my pores!!,"This cream clogged my pores and made my face break out!! BTW, I'd like to recommend this product to dry to normal skin, not oily skin (like me!!). I gave it to my mom and she loves it, but for me -- no more."
2,Not for me; your mileage may vary!,"Due to budgetary constraints, I had to find a cheaper night cream. I'm 43 with combo, slightly sensitive skin that's blackhead-prone and subject to the occasional pimple. For the most part I only need night cream in the wintertime. This feels lovely going on (soothing, silky texture); it's non-irritating (to me) and unscented. However, whether I apply a lot or a little, I wake up with extremely greasy skin that still feels somewhat dry and parched underneath, and the blackheads are worse. I'm guessing that sesame oil doesn't agree with me. It's hit or miss with natural oils--my face loves avocado and almond oils but olive and soybean oils make me break out. Your mileage may vary!I will be using this up on my neck and decollete, where it works beautifully--lovely glow and no greasiness--though n.b., I detect a slight scent of sesame oil under my turtlenecks and recommend you don't apply this under silk and dry-cleanables."
1,Also had allergic reaction...,I used this cream at night and woke up with an allergic reaction (which is always possible with new creams). My whole face was swollen and red and I had a numbing/tingling feeling. I washed my face and by the afternoon it was mostly gone. Test a small area first!I'm usually allergic to mold...First time I've had an allergic reaction to any cream and I've used Neutrogena products before.
5,Love it!,"I love this night cream! At first it seems a little sticky, but it gradually absorbs into your skin and by the time morning rolls around...my face is just so, so soft and moisturized!(I am 21, I have dry - combination skin.)"
5,Top game for the N64,"This has to be one of the greatest games made for the N64. I don't think many people have played it, but it's a great flight sim game. Definitely should be in any N64 collection of video game cartridges."
3,Tiny Gloves,I was pleased with everything besides the gloves. They are extremely tiny and the fingers are quite short. Not exactly sure who could actually wear these gloves comfortably... I think they should have done a study or two on the average measurements of hands.
3,Very Small,"The kit contains everything it says it does, but it is so small that the containers would best be described as samples. I was a little disappointed by the size and also wish that Burt's Bees would offer a more substantial hand care kit more similar to their foot care kit."
1,dont buy this,this item lookes so much better in the picture its so cheeseie and not worth the money that you pay for it
2,Small containers,This is a true trial/demo product size. I am not sure why it is so expensive given the VERY small amount of product you actually get. I would not recommend this choice in the Burts Bees line.
2,There is a happy ending!,"This is a mystery thriller that centers on the main character Aubrey Brice and a dark family secret. In it's 179 pages, the plot thickens continuously and each succeeding page keeps you wondering and guessing. What's happening to Aubrey, who's trying to kill her and why? The action begins slow enough with the author carefully constructing Aubrey's life. We are introduced to her family, coworkers, bestfriend (Brenna), childhood nemesis (Tansy) and her Love interest the very handsome insurance investigator Gregory Sterling. Aubrey is your average, normal, hardworking everyday young woman. She is also a what you see is what you get person, very down to earth --grounded. Her strong resolve is quickly tested withmultiple murders, a real big mean bad guy, gangsters, an insurance issue, childhood abandonment, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancy, car chases and MONEY. All of this leads back to the dark family secret.Reviewed by C. Love"
2,I was really disappointed in this product -- ...,"I was really disappointed in this product -- it just didn't work well for me. I thought it seemed rather greasy. Also, I noticed that after I used it two or three times, I got what looked like a rash. My skin got little flesh colored bumps wherever I had used it. It DID seem to really moisturize my skin, which is VERY dry, but I didn't like the greasy feel and the bumps I got from it. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,This was an opportune time for me to ...,"This was an opportune time for me to use lotion for extremely dry skin, since my skin dries out in the winter. I found the lotion was not effective when my skin was severely dry, but that it handled mild dryness very well. It also has quite a pleasant fragrance. I'd recommend it to others."
3,I was anxious to Test Drive this product ...,"I was anxious to Test Drive this product because my son has severely dry skin and eczema. I haven't really noticed any change in his skin condition while using this product. It's easy to apply and does seem to be absorbed quickly. There isn't a lot of fragrance, which can be irritating to my son's skin. I'm sure the lotion would be great for people with moderately dry skin, but it hasn't really been helpful in my son's case."
2,"This is a very thick, heavy lotion. My ...","This is a very thick, heavy lotion. My skin is extremely dry, and I was very excited to try this product. However, I was very disappointed. It is so thick it seems almost sticky, and it's very hard to rub into my hands. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or family."
3,Rose Water,"The shipment came fast and was sealed up very well. However, the product does not agree with my hair. The water makes my natural black hair crunchy and hard. I know that this may not be another person's experience so my review should not be a reason why another person shouldn't purchase it. It may just be my hair texture."
1,Shame on Amazon and Anchor Bay !,"I contacted Amazon today and they told me that I should contact Anchor Bay to find out if the DVD was defective yet. So, don't buy it because Amazon can't assure you the product is fine."
3,For the fans,"Like the first set, it's not the best quality, there are no subtitles available and no goodies on that one. But, hey, if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it very much!"
3,Silky Smooth,I am a big fan of this show. I was disappointed however when I opened the box set and Disc 3 was not with this puchase.The show still rocks. Rita and Chris are the Vice Cops of the 90s.
3,not yet,"I read all the reviews and contacted amazon, before I placed the order, they said they checked it, and it's fine-so we'll see if the have fixed the problem."
3,Sexy show -- but who done it?,"The earlier reviewer is correct. The episode Dead Weight on Disc Four is missing a key few minutes, namely the resolution. We don't learn who the real killer is. It is not a defective disc, the episode is just missing several minutes. This is probably the case across the board.I've had many problems with Anchor Bay (defective discs, missing discs, etc.). It's too bad that we have to deal with them if we want some of our favorite shows, especially Highlander. I have had to return/exchange every boxed set of that show because of defective discs.I guess I'll have to go to a fan site for Silk Stalkings and find an episode guide of the shows to learn who the killer is in the Dead Weight episode. It's like reading a mystery novel only to discover someone has ripped out the last few pages.Shame on you, Anchor Bay Entertainment."
5,Fantastic Show!!,"I remember having watched Silk Stalkings when it first came out years ago. I was completely sucked in by it then, and it sucked me right back into it when I watched it on DVD. I love the characters of Chris and Rita, and the chemistry between them. It was a fantastic show, and it is too bad there isn't one on TV like it now!!"
2,Not very well made,"Bought these for my son to wear during his municipal police academy physical training exercises. They lasted about 10 days before the sole began to separate from the boot. Apparently they are affixed only with some sort of adhesive. I attempted to reglue the sole to the boot, but the repair didn't last much longer than the original assembly. I cannot recommend these for serious use; they'd be good for a Halloween costume perhaps."
1,Bad Soles,"I bought these on August 15, 2012. In November, one lace broke and I replaced it. As of Fe. 4, 2013, The rubber on the soles of both shoes has worn down enough that it has gone through to the foam cushioning. I've put on Shoe Goo, but these will b in the trash very soon. I'm very disappointed that I only got 5 months use out of these. I wear them approx. 3 days a week, and walk to work 2 or sometimes 3 days a week in them, which is about 1 mile away. I find it hard to believe that a company would make boots this shoddy and give them to our soldiers. I've probably walked less than 120 miles in these, and the soles on the heels are gone. I've worn Jungle boots since 2001 or so. A few years back, they started being made in China, and the soles did not last. I was hoping that Ripple Sole Jungle Boots would not have this problem, but they are equally shoddy. Do NOT buy these, and if you find GOOD hot-weather combat boots that last more than 5 months with light use, please let me know."
3,SKINNY FEET SPECIAL,"THE SHOES, ALTHOUGH REPRESENTED AS SIZE 12 WIDE (U.S. SIZE) WERE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ON. THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE DEPTH OF THE BOOTS WHICH HURT WITH EVERY STEP ACROSS THE TOP OF MY FEET JUST PAST THE TOES WHEN I PUT THEM ON. I'VE NEVER WORN BOOTS OR SHOES SO SHALLOW. I'M TRYING TO STRETCH THEM NOW, HOPE IT WORKS"
3,Not as expected. Cheap boots n no comfort,"I really wanted to like these boots. They weigh nothing, are too narrow and very uncomfortable. You can tell by looking at them that they are not a quality pair of boots. They look cheaply and wear worse."
2,Not even close to high quality,I was expecting at minimum decent quality. What I got were cheap chinese made cardboard feeling boots. The ripple sole is cool but thats about it. Spend the extra money for a decent pair.
5,Good Boot,"Solid boot, well constructed. I ordered them for my current job but quickly realized they are not non-slip which I should have realized before ordering. Other than that they are great. Im sure I will find a use for them in the future. They hold a shine extremely well too."
4,Another great rodeo adventure!,"Clay Tory has turned pro in the rodeo circuit, riding saddle bronc, bareback and bull. He is working his way up the PRCA standings, traveling with good friend and surrogate father, Jack Lomas. Clay even has a girlfriend, barrel racer Tamara Allen. Everything should be perfect, but the top rodeo contenders are suddenly the victims of pranks, keeping them from competing. Clay and Jack are suspicious, but it isn't until Clay is viciously attacked, his riding hand mangled, that serious investigations begin. The trail leads to a group of wealthy gamblers betting on the standings, but which of them is organizing the escalating attacks?Wow, Flanagan's done it again. This is number 2 in the Rodeo Riders series, one that I hope has a long and healthy life. I was instantly drawn into Jack and Clay's lives, on and off the rodeo circuit. And Tamara is a fine addition to the growing family of friends and associates. Cowboy up and get this book. You won't regret it!"
1,Worst Game Ever,"I was so disappointed with this game. My 8 year old does not have enough patience to sit through the 'loading screens' which pop up before each game. If you think this is going to be anything like Mario Party, you will hate yourself for putting forty bucks down for this. I am surprised that Nickelodeon put their name on it.The characters are badly drawn, have no voices or sound clips or anything from the shows! I want my money back. Too bad, no refunds.I suggest, if you are still wanting this game, to go rent it first, then decide not to buy it."
1,Terrible...,I am SO glad I rented this game instead of buying it! Its so boring! All you do is throw food at each other! HOW BORING! And you cant even tell who you are! Nickeloden can do better than this!
1,Party Blast,"This game is for an adult with nothing better to do. There is talking, talking,talking messages on the game. Did I mention talking and the music is terrible."
1,Bad,"I could hardly sit through ten minutes of this game. Maybe that's too generous.Anyway, so I'm not blasting *no pun intended* it, I'll give some reasons. The animation was terrible, the game took way too long with all these loading screens, the controls were clunky and difficult, the games you did weren't very fun (more fun to play a flash game on your computer), and for some reason the computer players were incredibly hard to beat.You can really never expect much from TV/Movie games, though. I suppose some are good, but that's another entirely different topic.Long story short, I recommend you don't buy this game. Watch the TV chanel instead. WAY better."
5,A Great Beginners Book!,"SQL Server is a vast subject. I was sure a '10 Minute' book couldn't be worth anybody's time or money. But as it turns out, it's just because this book doesn't drown you in details, that it fills an urgent need for an approachable beginner's book.This book gives you the framework and practical understanding so that when you move on to other more detailed tomes you'll know where those details fit in.I'll be teaching both SQL Server 7 certification classes next semester and I intend to recommend this book to my students. It's a great place to start! (an the price ain't bad either ;-)"
5,A Quality Book,"Surprisingly, this is a very good book. I'm about halfway through it, and I've already gotten more than my money's worth. Think of this book as a primer to learning SQL Server. Instead of covering every topic in full depth, listing every possible option no matter how obscure, it covers the most useful ones with concise examples and explanations of what's happening each step of the way. A good example is the chapter on Active Server Pages. I had never created an Active Server Page. Yet, about 2 or 3 hours after starting the book, I had created my first one. And with the explanations given, it was easy for me to change some of the code and understand why it did, or didn't, work. If you've never used SQL Server before, want a good intro to it, and often start off your thoughts with the phrase, ""I wonder what would happen if I change this..."", then this will be a good book for you."
4,4.5 Stars - Very good way to get exposed to the basics...,"I needed a quick way to get exposed to the basics of SQL Server 7.0 due to the nature of my most recent job. Therefore I spent some time shopping, looking for the options that would allow me to achieve this.Price was not my main concern, yet William Robinson's book from the '10 minutes' series by Sams, gave quick answers to most of my questions, in a very nicely structured way: in lessons you can digest 10 minutes at a time.Major drawbacks: it refers too often to a Database you might not have installed in your machine (i.e. if you're reading the book at home in order to apply the acquired knowledge at work), PLUS there is an unnecessary sidetrack in lessons 4-8 (in my opinion). If you're using SQL Server, I don't think you'll be using it as much to interact with Word or Excel. Yet you can easily skip these lessons and the flow will not be affected significantly.Overall, I give it 4.5 stars."
3,seems as good of a magnesium tab as youll get,this was recommended for high blood pressure. it seems to be as good as any. but ive not taken any other kind
5,Adorable!,"Giant Microbes aren't for everyone but too the right people, they are a cute, educational, and fun way to display otherwise frightening insects and terrible diseases. The dust mite is the cutest of them all!"
4,Aesthetically pleasing kettle....,"...but a truly pathetic whistle!! Don't plan on this kettle's whistle alerting you to boiling water, you'll never hear it if you're in another room (or even if you're in the kitchen, but not paying attention - it's that quiet!!) But, do plan on receiving many compliments on your attractive kettle :-) Another bonus: this kettle cleans up very nicely - ie. when grease/sauce from a nearby pan splatter on the anodized aluminum surface, it can be wiped right off with no scrubbing or streaking. All in all, a nice teapot that looks great on a cooktop."
5,Love it,"I have been using this product or other formulas by Nutraderm for over 20 years. It is a great product. I was really happy to find it online since it's disappeared from stores.It is perfect for anytime your face feels dry, and is my favorite moisturizer. There is no other single product I have ever used for this length of time.I Love It !!!"
5,PRIVATE HELL,THIS TRACK IS GREAT WITH INSPIRING LYRICS! - THIS SHOULD BE GETTING AIR PLAY ON THE RADIO RIGHT NOW. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HUNTER PAYNE (YET!) BUT THIS SONG IS A SURE-FIRE WINNER!
5,Yet Another Fan,"I had had the priviledge of hearing most of the songs on the album long before it's release, but still had my personal favorites. ""When the Night Leaves Her Lonely"" and ""She Don't Know Why"" are sure hits, but the more I listened to the CD, the more I liked all the other songs. I think they all have a chance at being hits. I hate buying CDs where I end up only playing one or two songs. This CD is definitely an exception! Great lyrics, great vocals and great instrumentation make ""One Last Chance"" a jewel of an album. Great work Hunter!"
5,Good Honest Music,"I really enjoyed Hunter Payne's first CD, especially the song, ""When the Night Leaves Her Lonely"". Hunter has a depth of feeling to all his songs - must have lived a full and conscious life so far. It is also nice when a man can capture the feelings of a woman in a song. I look forward to listening to this CD over and over, and I look forward to his next CD, and I look forward to other artists covering his work. Well done!"
3,Alexipharmic - Run,"Alexipharmic addresses conflicts and social issues regarding the world today. Touching upon subjects that a majority of other ""rappers"" won't (or try to without knowing what the hell they're talking about) it makes sense here. Run is a solid album from start to finish that leaves the listener questioning their own morals and political standards. Cop this album because if you don't, you're losing the opportunity to learn something..."
3,This hand cream was okay. I like Neutrogena ...,"This hand cream was okay. I like Neutrogena and use a lot of their products, yet it wasn't as good as I expected. It wasn't that different from other products I've tried. It had a smooth gel texture which I didn't like that much because it dried too quickly and I couldn't get it all over my hands fast enough, so I had to keep re-applying more until I got it all over my hands. It was a good product though; it made my hands smooth and it wasn't greasy."
5,"With an infant in the house, we're constantly ...","With an infant in the house, we're constantly washing our hands. This has been causing our hands to get extremely dry and even crack at times. My wife and I used the Neutrogena Hand Cream quite often and we both agree that it's the best hand cream to use for dry hands!!!!"
3,This hand cream was not what I was ...,"This hand cream was not what I was expecting. Avon has a product called Silicone Glove -- that would be an accurate description for this cream. The best thing about it is that it isn't greasy. However, my hands felt """"sealed,"""" not moisturized, and if more than a tiny dab is applied, it leaves a sticky plastic feeling on my skin. If I were going to be spending a lot of time outdoors I might use this, but I'd use another moisturizer underneath it first. For me the biggest drawback is that Neutrogena (as I discovered) tests on animals. Even if I liked this product a lot, which I didn't, I wouldn't purchase it for this reason. In all, I'd say this cream is more protective than moisturizing."
3,One of many translations,I acquired this version of the I Ching as an appreciator of other works by John Blofeld. Having read his introductory comments - approximately 1/3 of the book - I must suggest that they be taken with a good deal of seasoning which each reader must add to taste. I cannot comment authoritatively on the accuracy of the translation or appropriateness of the editing from the source material but must say that it cannot compare with that of the Bollingen Wilhelm/Baynes edition. This edition may be useful as a cross reference from others (such as Wilhelm/Baynes) but I would limit it to that.
1,Miss leading ....buyer beware,Jobst makes the best hose out there and I love the ones I have gotten but this pair was unlike the usual pairs I have gotten before. This pair has no grips to have it stay up on your leg and requires that you buy a garter belt or something ......It might work but I cant say since I do not have a garter belt. The company who sales these items make it very hard to get just what you want they have miss leading info on the product. I realize its hard to describe things esp if you have huge numbers of them but your sales do depend on people getting the very item they want. Buyer beware ...!
1,UNABLE TO ORDER,How does Jobst expect me to order this when they DO NOT provide THEIR size chart???? the attached size chart is Amazon's standard size chart!!! My mother needs these but I cannot order unless I'm sure Jobst sizes are in line with other brands who did provide size chart.
2,Sticky,"I bought this pan to make an adorable brownie lady bug I saw in a Wilton Brownie book. I was very frustrated to find that it was extremely difficult to get the brownies out of the pan. I tried a little Pam. I tried a lot of Pam. I tried Pam coated with flour. Everytime I tried to get the brownies out, they stuck. Scooping them out made them chip and break. Finally, I found that if I kept gently pushing the edges down with the back of a spoon, the brownie would push up and out the other side. This would definitely not work with cake as it would crush the cake. I will eventually try the pan with cake batter, but I won't plan any special desserts with it until I test it. I am very skeptical."
5,Elegant Lamp with Superb Performance,"I have owned this lamp for about a year now and love it as much today as the day it arrived. I purchased two of these and they flank my fireplace, each on a side table. They look so elegant and classy. These are a heavy weight so they will not tip over when brushed by someone walking by. The chrome does not easily mark or fingerprint so they always look shiny and clean. These are well made, and Uttermost is my favorite lighting company. I own many lamps from Uttermost and all are well made, sturdy, well balanced and beautiful. I received them on time and well packaged. I would both buy from this vendor again as well as buy this product again. You will easily be able to purchase lamps and other lighting products less expensively than Uttermost, but you will get what you paid for. If you choose to spend a little extra for this brand, you will find, as I have, that it is by far the best value for long term beautiful lighting."
4,Just one problem,"Penton Overseas was on the right track when they devolped ""Immersion plus"" however, for some reason which escapes me, they decided not to go with all native speakers in the audio track; an error for which the student listener will likely suffer. One character in the dialogs named ""Silvia"" (who is obviously an English speaker) has some severe pronunciation issues typical of begining/intermediate Spanish students and should never have been used in a product like this where pronounciation is critical and students are likely to hang on every word. Could they not afford real Spanish speakers?"
1,Advanced Student of Spanish,"I completely agree with reviewer, ""Shameful ..."" The errors are legion, and especially in the uses of the subjunctive. It is astonishing that such a shabby product ever saw the light of day and then received such a glowing review from Anna Rivera. Anna, are you really digging into these products? We depend on you. My copy is in the recycle bin for its true value -- the plastic."
3,Unemotional speakers makes for boring conversations,"Overall, the goal of the cd's is good. However, the speakers really lack true emotion. It can be hard to follow the conversations because the speakers are monotone most of the time. I find myself getting bored and then losing focus when listening to these cd's. I continue to listen to them hoping I will get every word but I just can't help but to start daydreaming as I listen. I'm just hoping my subconscious mind is absorbing the language :)"
2,Look for something else,I teach Spanish and I recommend looking for another resource. Some of the translations are not accurate and much of the Spanish used is not conducive to normal conversation.
4,A good primer,"As a very inexperienced camper, I feel relatively prepared after reading this book! Although the author is clearly more of an *x-treme* outdoorsman than I will ever be, the information about all levels of outdoor activities is interesting and might prove useful one day. A very quick, easy read - highly recommended!"
3,Cute but flimsy,"Adorable design that made a great gift for my daughter, but the band is falling apart after about 6 months of wear."
5,A hardcore Bebop Fan is happy,"When it comes to Cowboy Bebop I'm a fanatic, so I felt compelsed to buy the manga to further my Bebop collection. At first I thought the manga art was a little odd but it grew on me and I was waiting for the next instalation of this great series. If you pay attention to what each character says not only do you catch odd bits of 20th century pop-culture, but some how our author and artist captures the original anime's slick humor and Shinichiro Watanabe's vision for the series. By far this is one of the best done series to manga conversions I've ever seen. Although it's a little disappointing that there are only books in the manga's installation. All I can hope is that there will more added to this great manga series. This series is most definitely worth your hard earned money!"
1,La peste,"Este tipo de musica no merece ser publicada, nunca te compres un disco de camela, es música para ginchos.ENGLISH: Press the ""back"" button of your browser and have a good day."
3,All the same jokes as the other National Lampoon books,"Every single cartoon in this book is also in the book - National Lampoon's Cartoon Book The Best of 18 Years - and they are all also in -National Lampoon's Truly Sick, Tasteless, and Twisted Cartoons . So now I purchased 3 books with all the exact same cartoons. I would recommend to anyone who does not already have one of these books to buy - National Lampoon's Truly Sick, Tasteless, and Twisted Cartoons , because it has all the jokes from the other 2 books plus a lot more cartoons , it's a pretty thick book.As far as the cartoons go, these are great cartoons done by the greatest cartoonists of all time. I love the cartoons , I just don't need 3 copies. I'm actually afraid to but any of the other National Lampoon books because I don't want a forth copy of the same book"
4,Good Lotion for Dry Skin,"I used UltraMide 25 lotion from Baker-Cummins for about 20 years. (The ""25"" refers to the urea content). Baker-Cummins unfortunately does not made UltraMide 25 any more, so I am trying this Nutraplus lotion which contains 10% urea. So far I find it very good for my extra dry skin. It rubs in easily and does leave my skin feeling greasy. I definitely recommend any lotion that contains urea if you have very dry skin."
2,not worth the money,"I bought the basic version, and I regret it; definitely not worth the money: the vocabulary lists are meager, and that's all this really is: mostly very basic noun practice, with a few lists of common phrases thrown in. I suppose this would be worth shelling out for if you want to learn some names of animals, but if not, not. The pronunciation function is helpful in that it has a slow-speed version to help you hear all the sounds in a word, but still not worth the money, even if it's just three-starbucks-beverages worth. Pity. Transparent Language started as a rigorous drill program that included grammar forms, etc. This is just rather thin."
5,Fabulous - Ten thumbs up!,"Over 400 pages of pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family,friends and enemies. This volume contains every knownpicture of Lincoln, including the ones used on the penny and5 dollar bill. Which are 2 of his worst presidential poses.The compilation is so complete it contains a picture of hishorse, Old Bob, (unfortunately, there is no extant pictureof his other horse, New Bob) and his dog, Fido.The text is easy-going and informative without any scholarly weightiness and the only mistake I could detect is on p. 71. Can you find it? The same consortium produced a very fine 4-part documentary for PBS."
4,Fantastic pan but the bottom coating is coming off,"My husband and I love these pans and how they cook food. We follow the directions about preheating which is important and have never washed them in the dish washer and hand wash them thoroughly. BUT, the bottom covering is coming off and the silver is showing through and there are places on the bottom where there are black spots I cannot get clean despite all the hand washing. They wash up easily other than the spots on the bottom! I read in one of the reviews below about a special cleaner or bon ami so may try those. We have a whole set and have really enjoyed them a great deal despite the problems I""ve mentioned above."
3,Herbie Hancock,Herbie is probably the best out there. I think this is a bootleg tape made into a cd. Not the very best but I will not fault Herbie. I should be playing with him. I'd learn but he's get something out of it too. He's a great master of music.
1,You Can't Go Home Again,"I thought this CD would contain her classic performances -- instead I learn it was recorded last year and in early 2001. Ms. James is long past her prime. Her voice now calls for orchestral support, warmth. Instead, we get Cedar Walton's notion -- rhythm section with brass dominated by fluegel horn(!). Almost unlistenable. Everything mixed at same level, no layering, no subltely. I blame Walton's arrangements -- boring, stilted, unimaginative, lazy. Poor Etta."
2,this book didn't help much,"This book depressed me more than helped me. I really didn't tell me anything I don't already know. First of all, the first half of the book says how small talk is easy and effortless if you don't think about it too much. Then second half of the book tells you all the things you should remember when making small talk. This is a big contradiction. Second, the examples are way too far from real life. In the ""first date"" example, the couple talk about more interesting stuff in 2 minutes than I've done in the last 2 years. Quite frankly, it would be easy to make small talk if I had that much to say. Lastly, this book didn't tell me anything I don't already know. All it says is to ask questions and be interested in the person you are talking to. If I wasn't interested in the person, I wouldn't be trying to talk to them. This book may help some people, but it was a waste of time for me."
1,Not what I expected,"The quality and cost of the book was quite disappointing. The pages that were stapled in the book were out of order and other pages were falling out. The first impression was not good.The content was ""ok"" but not practical for the introverts that struggle to begin a conversation. If you want to spend this amount on a communication book and learn important details in communicating, I suggest ordering Conversationally Speaking that lists how others perceive you as you converse and how to read others' ""signals"" during a conversation. Another suggestion is How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less that also gave better advise on conversations than this pocket guide."
4,Very Helpfull,"The book is good and helpfull, but it's not going to make you Mr. Popularity. You have to make yourself that on your own. Which isn't to say that it's not worth getting. If you need help with learning how to talk to people then it's a good buy. It teaches you what you're doing wrong and how to fix it, and though it will make you feel better about yourself and make you feel more confident, it won't take away any sort of anxiety you have when speaking to someone you don't know. If you apply what the good Dr. says though, in time things like feeling foolish around people will start to get less and less. A little pricey for a book that you could finish in an hour and a half, but filled with enough advice to make it a sound buy."
2,"""How To Win Friends..."" would have been better","This is a bit brief and dry. To me, not worth more than about $5. I really got nothing from it."
2,Not as informative as I had hoped,"After recently purchasing a cocker spaniel puppy, I was looking for a book that would give an insight to temperament, behavior, and possible health concerns of cockers. This book touched very briefly on these subjects and focused more on details for owning a show-dog. Since our cocker is purely a house pet this information did not interest me. There was very little in terms of the insight of understanding cocker spaniels and the best way of training your cocker. There are lots of cute pictures of all the different colors cockers come in, but other than that I didn't get much information that I was seeking from this book."
1,Not a very good product at all.,The silicone case ripped when I put it on the phone. The charger end broke off in my phone.
1,A Big No Show,"I ordered this product, waited ten days and then finally decided to track it. Tracking showed that the product had been taken all over the US and finally was brought to my doorstep where DHL was unable to deliver it. Why? No one seems to know the answer to that question. Of the five products I ordered, all of which were to go to the same address, only one has arrived in the now 12 days since the original order was placed. So, while these rice crackers may be delicious, I'll never know as they are now out of stock and unavailable. After spending way too much time to finally get a refund for them, I don't think I'll be ordering from Amazon again. As for the other products that I ordered and haven't received, Amazon is going to send them to me again - in 10 to 14 days. My advice, use Amazon to find out about products and then order directly from the manufacturer. Amazon has gotten too big to provide good customer service and is making too much money to care."
2,not what you are wanting,"computer created, frequently words run together with no spacing- goofy computer generated information lines occasionally, no illustrations- just not a book lovers book- a poor reproduction"
5,It Really Works,"This winter has been really rough for my skin (which I know is the case for most people this year). The dry and cold air has left my skin especially dry and my hands have even cracked and bled this season. I am no stranger to dry skin...but this year I purchased a couple of different products hoping to find some relief. I am so happy that I purchased this product. The first day I believed I used it twice and that same day my hands felt much better. By the next day my hands had improved greatly. Even after washing my hands repeatedly throughout the day I do not have to continuously apply this lotion. I even purchased the lotion intended for the body...I was going to go back and pick up the cream for feet, but I no longer have to because the lotion has done the trick. I usually prefer lotions with no scent but this scent is really nice. I plan to stick with this product and will also purchase other Neutrogena products in the future."
1,terrible,I am so sorry I bought this product. I had never used it before and thought I would try it. It is sticky and gummy and seems to never dry on your hands.
2,Leaves your hand very sticky/yucky,"It does an excellent job of hydrating your skin and there are plenty of reviews that confirm that. But if your hands are in decent/OK shape and you're just looking for a little moisturizing from time to time, get something else. This is not something that you just keep rubbing in, leaving your hands normal and free to use when the ""rubbing"" has finished. Nope. It's hard to explain, but 10 minutes later I am still left rubbing my hands together to make that feeling go away so that I can continue using my computer in a normal way again.It's great for feet though! or if you don't use your hands (before going sleep maybe?). But expect to want to wash your hand after using this before going on with your day to day life."
2,no substitute for age shield hand cream,"I purchased this hand cream as the Neutrogena age shield hand cream has been unavailable for months. Neutrogena tells me that the age shield cream has not been discontinued but is either being reformulated,repackaged, etc & should be available in the future. I hope this is the case as the regular hand cream is very greasy & not as easy to apply as the age shield. I hope they bring the age shield back. This is a poor substitute & I regret I purchased it."
2,I was very anxious to try the Neutrogena ...,"I was very anxious to try the Neutrogena Hand Cream, being that my skin is very dry in some areas. To my surprise, it did help with the dryness. In the future, if I were to need a dry-skin lotion again, I'd consider buying this product -- if the cost were reasonable."
4,Very good hand cream,"First the product is called a ""hand cream"" but I think Neutrogena should change the name to Moisturizer Cream because you can use this stuff on any part of the body - even your lips. As for the effectiveness this cream is very good. It does a very good job at relieving dry, rough skin. I love the fact that it's fragrance free - I don't like putting anything on my body with too much scent in it and prefer products that are fragrance free. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the product is almost a little too thick and leaves my hands a little greasy and slippery."
5,Good product!,"I've been using Neutrogena hand cream for years, i always like it! for the price, no other hand cream can beat it!"
1,Greasy and doen't help,"The feel of this product is very greasy and it leaves a residue. It's not a cream, but more like an ointment. A thick ointment. It is fragrance free as I wanted, but it doesn't seem to soften my hands as advertised. I don't like it at all."
4,These hand creams are quite effective!,My hands are extremely dry during the winter time. These hand creams do provide plenty of moisture but more like a thin coating on applied areas. I like these hand creams because they are not so oily and it is absorbed fast.
5,Best hand cream,This works wonders for me because I always have dry hands. Even after washing my hands and through long periods of time my hands never get dry. I love to use it product. Just a little dab does it. It's a really thick formula but once you smooth it into your hands it absorbs. Doesn't leave too much of a lotiony goop feeling on your hands either.
3,"Too thick, greasy","When I use it, I then want to wipe off my hands, because it is too greasy on my palms. That is rubbing it into the skin on top of my hands and wrists does not reduce the greasy feel on my palms, no matter how little I use."
5,A winner in Minnesota for over 20 years,I've been using this product every night for over 20 years and I swear by it. I use it generously on my hands and elbows just before retiring and I never have to apply hand cream all day long. I live in Minnesota. My hands are in water a LOT and I'm a zealous hand washer who uses soap. The only hand cream I use is this one. Cannot be beat. Totally worth the price.
5,Releif for Hands!,"I found out about this product when I went to my dermatologist for a skin condition. I had patches of very dry skin and cuts from my skin splitting... very painful! After a couple of days, my dry patches and splits were healed. I still have the skin condition, but I apply this lotion every night at bedtime and my hands have been fine. Even though this lotion is pretty thick, I highly recommend it because it does what it claims. I give this lotion 5 Stars and will probably be using this the rest of my life for my skin condition... but hey, it beats going to the dermatologist and being prescribed $140.00 cortizone cream!"
5,Can't Beat It,This is the best lotion I've found to prevent and heal chapped hands and even chapped lips. I use it twice a day after I brush my teeth and the chapped dry skin on my hands and lips are a thing of the past. I highly recommend it.
4,Soothes Chapped Hands Better Than Just About Anything Else,"Neutrogena hand cream is just about the best heavy-duty hand lotion out there. It isn't nearly as greasy as many of the hand creams on the market. It is quick and easy to apply because it rubs into your skin fairy quickly, yet its effects are long lasting. Using this cream a couple of times a day really helps my chapped hands.The only drawback of this product as far as I'm concerned is its packaging. The old version of this product used to have a flip-top cap which was much easier to use and less messy than the screw-on cap which the new version has."
3,Extremely Greasy but Effective,"Honestly this might be closer to 4 stars, but after seeing a zillion 5 star reviews, I think it's misleadingly rated.Is it effective? Yeah, seems like. Nothing life changing, but seemed like a good hand cream and no annoying fragrance. However, it feels a bit like putting vaseline on your skin - in other words, it doesn't really get absorbed and sits on the outside of your skin. I s'pose this protects it from the elements, but it also makes for kinda greasy hands.I generally prefer moisturizers that absorb into the skin eventually, so maybe I'm not the target audience. If you're looking for a vaseline type hand cream, this is great - but if you're expecting something like Eucerin or Lubriderm or Kiehl's Hand Cream, this is a very different style product."
2,moisturizing??,"I applied the cream correctly every time, and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin, BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product doesn't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is ""concentrated"" apparently but i need moisture!! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy, I'm guessing it's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something, but it's very unpleasant feeling. It smells like plastic even though it's fragrance free."
2,Too oily,I bought this item for my mother as a gift and she did NOT like it because she feels its too oily. She does not like the smell either.
3,hand creams are very subjective,"I have found that hand creams are even more subjective than facial creams. I wash my hands a lot during the day. I have found the Neutrogena not a good solution for me. It leaves a residual film on the hands which makes it tough to work or even greet customers with a handshake. I have switched now to VASELINE Healthy Hands and Nails during the day which soaks into your hands much faster. I personally think hand creams are much more a factor of how often you use it rather than which product. I try to use my VASELINE after every other hand wash. The Neutrogen is good for the night before going to bed. However even there I feel like you wash a lot off first thing in the morning, so I am not so sure how much really goes into your hands rather than stays on the surface.My next try will be the AVEENO hand cream but as I said I don't believe the product matters as much as how often you use it and here the Neutrogena is hard because of its film residue."
5,Instant cure for dry skin,"Sometimes a girl gets really dry, cracked skin. This is what I use in an emergency elephant skin situation. Hands, elbows, soles of my feet. A few days of using this and my skin feels normal. During the summer when I am flip-flopping it all over the place, I slather this on my feet in the morning and at night. Love it!"
4,Best hand cream for men.,"Fantastic hand cream. I have been using this hand cream for more than 10 years.I knocked off one star because this tube came with a screw on cap. My previous tube had a flip open cap, which is far more convenient."
3,Very effective for moisturizing but too greasy to stand,"It really does work. My hands and feet often have very dry skin and just one application of this moisturizer makes a visible difference and makes the skin feel much smoother. However, it takes ages to absorb and I absolutely HATE the greasy feel, so I don't really use it very often, which kind of defeats the purpose. Sadly, I'll have to continue my search for a good moisturizer. If you can stand it, go for it."
4,"Nice handcream, but not as magic as it was broadcasted","Good hand cream for its price. It has a perfect size (2oz, safe for airplane!), no strong smell, greasy when you first apply it but it gets absorbed right away.The healing effect is good, does make my hand softer and smoother. But it does not last if you don't continuously apply it. On this part, I think I like L'occtaine better. But as I said at the very beginning of this review, for its price, it works very well!"
3,This product left my hands too slippery for ...,"This product left my hands too slippery for me to use it during the day. So I used it only at night, and my hands were much softer and smoother when I awoke. During the day I used a different product. """"Just a dab"""" was correct -- not much was required to do the job. Initially, I didn't like the feeling that my hands were coated with something, but this sensation didn't last long. I'd recommend it for use as a night hand cream. I need something during the day that isn't so slippery."
5,A Nature Lover's Favorite Calendar!,"The stunning photographs in this engagement calendar, complete with educational descriptions, are only part of the joys to owning it. Unlike other engagement calendars that I have owned, there is a picture for every week. Cross-cultural special days are noted as well as the moon cycles. There is plenty of space to write important information. Something that might benefit the book that other engagement calendars have are a sturdier spiral binding and a durable plastic cover- otherwise, for those who love animals and nature, this engagement calendar is about as close to perfection as you can get!"
2,Calphalon Salt & Pepper Shaker,"I bought this for the simplistic look, design, capacity and because of the Calphalon name. I really liked this S&P shaker in the beginning, but soon became disappointed when I tried to get the lids off for a refill. The lids were extremely hard to get off. Over time, salt and pepper dust works it way into the screw threads between the canister and lid and virtually freezes the two pieces together. On more than one occasion I had to use a strap wrench to free the lid. Lastly, and this may have been my error, I washed these S&P shakers in my dishwasher on the top rack. Doing so permanently changed the finish/color to a duller black and they don't look as nice."
4,It's working!,"Dr. Krystosik's book was the key I needed to finally begin to lose weight. It's not a diet, rather it's a change of lifestyle. And a pleasant one at that. I am not hungry and I am seeing numbers on my scale that I haven't seen in years."
5,Zebba's Dramatic Bone Structure,"Dr Sam Zebba is a brilliant literary anatomist. Investigating five plays and a film, he lays bare the bones of great drama with deft precision.It's the actual predictability of the 39 steps that makes it so exciting, being able to apply it so widely. In Hamlet, Zebba's theory appear at first to contradict the accepted sequence of scenes - until you realise that this is exactly how Shakespeare originally intended his action to unfold.39 steps won't normally get you much beyond your front door, but with Zebba's 39 you're equipped for a whole journey of discovery."
5,The 39 Steps Spring to Life,"Sam Zebba has set himself a monumental challenge, and has carried it off with sagacity and scholarship. Comparatively viewed table by table, the 39 steps in each of the plays examined spring to life with startling accuracy. Although admitting that we often search for rules only to discard them in the name of creative freedom, Zebba asserts, correctly, that a work of art following a set of rules is not necessarily inferior to one that does not."
3,Everything but comfort,"This stroller had a great sunshade, very easy to fold, loved the child tray, very sturdy... HOWEVER my 6 month old was so uncomfy in this stroller. every walk turned into a screaming marathon. It also did not handle any kind of bumps very well, it jostled her to even more discomfort. I had to buy a different stroller and she is perfectly comfy now. and walks are a pleasure. It is really too bad---- I loved all the features this stroller had,,, too bad my baby hated it so much."
2,Not worth the extra money,"For the money, I don't think you can beat the Expedition line of strollers. I actually went into a store to look at them in person. I compared this model, the ""Expedition XL"", to the regular ""Expedition"". The only difference I could find was the child's tray...and the XL was $50 more! (I can live without the tray!)I recommend the ""Expedition""..$100."
5,Expedition LX Jogging Stroller,"This is a shower gift for a daughter - another daughter already has one, and loves it. It is great for walking, running, etc. - well balanced and easy to use."
1,What a poor description,"Right off the bat, the FRONT WHEEL DOES NOT SWIVEL!!!!Nowhere in the description does it indicate that. And it's a pain to steer.We didn't discover that until we put it together and now Amazon in their return policy will only refund 50% because we opened it and took all the strapped on carboard off of it.Thank goodness Babys-R-Us allowed me to exchange it for full price at their store near us."
1,Good product but not for me,"Product is good, but just didn't work for us. It's big and difficult to collapse. Don't even try to collapse the stroller while holding an infant. You need two hands. The infant's head knocks around from side to side. My 9 month old cries the whole time he's in it. I tried to jog w/ him in it but he screamed the whole time. The back padding is hard and uncomfortable for him."
4,Great Story!,"From the golden pleasure domes of Constantinople to the barbaric pomp of Malcolm of Scotland's court, this is the magical tale of ravishingly beautiful Mairin of Aelfleah, called Enchantress by the three men who loved her: Basil, Prince of Byzantium, who taught her passion's tender secrets...Josselin de Combourg, gallant knight of William the Conqueror...and Eric Longsword, the Viking whose tragic love for Mairin would never be fulfilled. And in their wild world gone mad with savage war, only love could truimph over all. This was a great Bertrice book. Up to her usual standard. Love her novels!"
2,Enchantress Mine,"I don't know...I guess I must have been reading a different book. Yes, the history in Enchantress Mine is rich and detailed, and some of the characters in the book are rather amusing. But poor Mairin! Of the three love interests she has in this book, one lacks a manhood, another's manhood is questionable, and the other is just plain boring! C'mon Ms. Small, you can do much better! Read Skye O'Malley, Love, Wild and Fair or Wild Jasmine instead."
3,"Close,but no cigar","I enjoyed the story but Small outdoes herself in the Skye O'Malley books. I guess Skye has spoiled me. In this book look out for old Eric Longsword. I want to warn you his ""long sword"" was imaginary in more ways than one. All in all it was an okay read....until the next in the O'Malley saga."
4,A LITTLE ON THE BAZAAR SIDE BUT WORTH THE READ,AFTER I HAVE READ THE SKYE O'MALLEY SERIES NOTHING SEEMS TO COME CLOSE. I WOULD GIVE THIS ABOUT 3 1/2 STARS. THIS WAS A GOOD STORY WITH A FEW GOOD CHARACTERS. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT DAGDA. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE BERTRICE SMALL FAN AS I AM AND ENJOY HISTORICAL ROMANCE BOOKS.I DO HAVE TO LAUGH AT TIMES THAT THE CHARACTERS IN THESE BOOKS ARE ALWAYS SOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL.
2,"4 stars for the key, 1 star for the seller","The nice thing about this key is that it has a large bow (the part you hold), giving you much better leverage when turning the key in the lock. That said, the seller, Amazing Keys (fulfilled through Amazon), is charging $7.90. I found the same key at Lowes today for $4."
5,The workhorse of my kitchen :),"I love this pan. I've used it almost daily for over a year and it's still good-as-new. Cleans easily, heats evenly, no problems with sticking. If you need one ""do everything"" pan for your kitchen, this is it."
1,Do Not buy!!!!,"This item stinks!! It is poorly made and you have to push the button 3 times before the sensor triggers. only a very small half sime portion of the noses trigger a sound, and it was too difficut for my baby to push. Save your money and buy the fisher price peek-a-boo piano!"
2,Snow Job,"I guess I'm still just looking for someone to tell me why this book was ever written. Intrigued by The Beans of Egypt Maine and amazed at the breadth and perceptiveness and sheer wonder of Merry Men, despite it's controversial characters, I was struck dumb with disappointment for days after reading Snow Man. The characters are shallow and inconsistent (all of them-- left, right and center). The plot could have been taken from any murder ""mystery."" And the theme was not only blatantly sensational, but worse, devoid of any real substance. Chute opens the book with the warning that this is only a preview of a larger work to come, more fully exploring right-wing militias. If this is the way she's going to approach them, let's hope she was only kidding. Skip it, and bring us the next Merry Men!"
2,This book is not in a league with Chute's other work.,"I often refer friends to the work of Ms. Chute, for its raw realism, extraordinary character development, and ability to take one to places and situations never imagined. This book is the first time she has disappointed me (tremendously) on the first two counts, and while better on the third, still does not measure up to her other work. This book reads like a first draft or idea for a book, which is never adequately developed."
2,Disappointing,"I anticipated another wonderful Carolyn Chute book when I picked this one up. I did not find any of the colorful characters and unique story that she has entertained me with in the past. It was so far off from her other books, it makes me wonder where she wrote it and why she wrote it."
1,C-Clamp style bed frames are cheaply built and over-priced,"I have a c-clamp style queen bed frame that is constantly falling apart. The C-clamp screws are always stripping out. I don't know how many I've purchased to replace mine. I would never purchase one again, in fact, if it were free I still wouldn't take it."
4,"Nice, quiet, easy to set up","Nice product, especially if bought at a sale price. Easy to assemble and set up. Quiet and cool in operation. It also looks nice.I would have rated it 5/5, was it not for the fact that the hardware encryption is mandatory (would have been nice if it were optional) and thus requires reformatting of the HDD once inserted into enclosure. The need for formatting might require storing away / restoring data if an existing HDD is used with the enclosure. This, however, is not a major issue; I was able to save away / restore TimeMachine HDD without any issues. Any other restores should be even easier. Overall, I'm very happy with this product."
2,Nice pictures....but little to read !,"When I bought this book online I thought that it contains plenty of science fiction with details, but I discovered that it is full of pictures with few words in each page.... really not worth it's price!."
2,Beware of Bias!,"Despite many helpful insights into the supernatural, Mrs. Penn-Lewis' background leaves much to be desired. From The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal & Charismatic Movements by S.M. Burgess, ed., it is stated that she & F.B. Meyer were instrumental in suppressing the Welsh Revival of 1904-05. She also ""took control"" of Evan Roberts, the Revival leader, by ""censoring his mail & keeping him from the public"". He lived in their household for years.In the original book, Jesse Penn-Lewis attributed the ecstatic manifestations of the Revival to demonic influences. She also put Mr. Roberts name (as co-author) on the book to lend it authenticity.Thus, any reader of the charismatic/pentecostal persuasion needs to be aware of this. I recommend Pigs in the Parlor by the Hammonds, plus books by Derek Prince: Spiritual Warfare, They Shall Expel Demons, Blessing or Curse---You Can Choose."
3,A treasury of spiritual understanding for these last days.,"If you have had no previous experience with demonic powers (channelling, possession, etc) either prior to or since becoming a Christian, you need to read this book. The Word of God urges us to not be ignorant of the enemy's devices. In these last days, the devil will even masquerade himself as an angel of light, performing miracles, signs, and wonders, that he will be able to deceive even the most discerning of Christians. We must know what he's up to and resist him, standing steadfast in the faith. And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet! (Romans 16:20)"
5,LOVE IT!,"I have had this wallet for about 6 years now. It has held up wonderfully... I still love its style and functionality. Great design, great quality, great price."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is an excellent book for anyone even remotely interested in Chess. Not only does it describe the evolution of the design of chess pieces and boards, but it also provides many interesting historical tidbits. The book explains in detail why, where, and when changes were brought about in chess. I highly recommend this book to all people who enjoy chess or even just design."
2,Interesting but not architecture at all,interesting enough standard chess history but nothing on actual chess piece architecture or chess piece design or manufacturing. nothing on turning or different sets that could be turned on a lathe. mostly either ancient hand-carved sets or very ornate antique sets.
2,Great pan...but,"This was my favorite pan for about a year. It is very versatile and cooks well. I always used plastic utensils, and a non-abrasive scrub brush, but, nontheless, after a year of use, the coating is coming off the pan. I'm going to pitch it because I don't want to be eating the coating. This is the second Calphalon pan that did this to me. I think you may have to spend the big bucks to get a decent pan that will last."
4,"Good Pan, but ...","When I first purchased it, I loved it. We used it about 2-3 times a week. I am very careful as to use wooden spoons or rubber spatulas so as not to scratch the surface of the pan. After about 7 or 8 months of use, the non-stick surface started to wear off. I still use it, however, but am looking for a replacement. I cannot find this exact same pan anymore."
1,Received damaged,Just learned after shipping this item as a Christmas gift that the item is damaged and not usable. Now we can't figure out how to return it.
2,30-Second Commercial Descirbes Non-stick Coating,"Quality of pan and lid seems high, but low rating is for the non-stick coating. We used this pan 4 to 5 times a week. Non-stick coating didn't hold up after repeated use. Only took about 6 months for the coating to flake away. We've gone back to the traditional Calplalon cookware."
3,It's okay,"It works well as a detangler, but it's scented a bit too much for horses, I think. My horse tolerated it, but he gave me a funny look when he took a whif and didn't really like it when I put it on his mane."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this product to untangle the fur on my cockapoo however, it did not work as promised. It did not get rid of the matting nor tangles. I am disappointed with this product, which is pretty expensive, and I'm mad at myself for buying it. I guess my dog will have to go to the groomer and get the tangles cut."
1,Bad Battery,Batterty was totally dead and would not charge. Poor support from vendor being a premium battery. Still waintin for a resulation.Very poor response form vendor.
3,WEAPONS OF PUNISHER DESTRUCTION,THIS COMIC WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A STORY BUT BRILL ART WORK BY E R BROWN IS BASICALY A CATALOUGE OF WEAPONS AND THIER USES..... DEF PICK UP FOR PUN FANS
4,Interesting Book,"This book is fascinating. Definitely has some good points about how I see myself as a woman and how I define my relationships with my mother and other important women. I don't agree with everything in it, but I found it very worth reading."
4,Great product!,I love this product for allergy season and sinus relief. Takes a little time to kick in but once it does it is well worth it. Drink lots of water with it.
5,Miracle Pill for migraine sufferers,"As many of us I was skeptical to try a new product without knowing anyone who had tried it. However, after suffering with migraines for years, I decided to give it a try. It has only been a short time and these pills actually work. I didn't realize it at first. I suffer with menstrual migraines every month for the duration of my cycle. I sometimes can't get out of bed. After taking Migra-eeze, I realized at one point during my cylce, holy cow, no migraine. Not even a little headache. I feel amazing everyday all day and I truly believe its a result of these pills. I strongly recommend them to anyone who suffers from migraines. Its a blessing in disguise."
5,Great,"This product has helped my son a lot, He use to get at least 3 or 4 headaches a week now since he has been taking this product its down to 1 or 2 a month. Thanks a lot."
5,Migra-Eeze,"My sister suffers from debilitating migraines - so much so that at times, all she can do is go to bed in a darkened room and try to sleep it off. Prescription medications for migraines are expensive, and she does not have insurance. I was looking for something affordable that might help her, and I saw a review from someone that said their neurologist recommended Migra-Eeze. I ordered it for her, and she has had very positive results. While her headaches have not completely been eliminated, they are certainly fewer and easier to deal with. She is sold on this product!"
1,Absolute garbage,"I purchased the Xantrek Prosine 2.0 and installed it in our RV. Within four months of use it doesn't work. I called Xantrex tech support who advised they no longer repair this and many other products as they are all being made in China. If it's within their two year warranty period they will replace it with a refurbished unit, otherwise they sell you a new one at 30% off list price(which is more than you can by it online). We bought ours from a RV dealer who is now out of business so we are out $1800.00. A disposable unit only at a premium price. I phoned dozens of their factory authorized repair faclities listed on their website. Each and everyone said Xantrex products have hit the rock bottom and are garbage. Shame on you XANTREK!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUYERS BEWARE, IF YOU PURCHASE THIS UNIT KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT WHEN IT FAILS YOU'LL NEED TO REBUY IT. Google Xantrek Prosine Problems and read the countless reviews and problems on the net about this company and their products."
2,What a sham !,"Based on Nick Ienatsch book I made the terrible mistake of purchasing this absolutely pointless video. If at all, the only thing that it mildly accomplishes is provide advertisement for Reg Pridmore's motorcycling school - which by judging from this video leaves a lot to be desired in terms of structure and true hard-core motorcycle coaching. Lucky for all of us serious sports motorcyclists there are excellent options out there... if you know what I mean !"
4,Best orchestral version of Pachelbel's Canon ever!,This is the best orchestral version i've heard & i've heard about a 100!The recording is very clear unlike many others out there.The rest of the cd is quite good too.
2,A little disappointing,I recently purchased a Calphalon griddle (which I love) and thought that the Calphalon spatula would be a worthwhile companion piece. I have never cooked on my griddle above medium heat and do not leave the spatula on the pan. The use of this spatula is reserved to use only on my Calphalon griddle to flip sandwiches. What is disappointing is that the edge is melting already after only about 6 times used. I assumed (my error) that Calphalon would manufacture complimentary accessories that would hold up to normal use of their cookware. The price was not worth it.
3,A little more flexible than I was hoping...,"But it can take the heat of sauteing and other high temp cooking! Sure you can buy it locally, but with the free shipping with a ... purchase, WHY FIGHT THE CROWDS! Good price for a good product!"
1,False Advertisment!!!,The ad showed vintage grinch game which i wanted and when it arrived it was the current version! False advertisement and Amazon would only give me back 3.00 and I bought it as a gift. Just wrong!
3,Fine for Child's Room,"This has solid construction but needs some tweaks. The top trim is ""you-assemble,"" so wood glue is needed to make it look tight. The unit hangs by two small sawtooth hangers. For our energetic daughter's room, we will take those off and wall-mount the unit so she can load the shelf without fear of losing her treasures. The upper shelf is detachable. It has weirdly bulky/ugly shelf supports. Ours arrived with half a support missing, which is OK because we will be replacing them. All that said, the item is sturdy, shipped quickly, and you can't beat the price."
5,don't leave home without it,"I have traveled to Europe several times and this is my favorite travel journal to take with me. I like this jounal best for several reasons. First, it is small enough to fit in my jacket pocket but large enough to write in comfortably. It is also durable, the paper being a nice weight and the cover substantial enough to resist curling. There is space to record information about shopping, restuarants, museums, photography notes, and memories. The pages are lined, which I prefer. Lastly, it is very attractive, with the cover looking like a detail of a map and some pages having a small sketch. I had difficulty finding one the last time I traveled, so I am pleased to see that Amazon is offering it. I recommend it for anyone who wants to capture the best moments of his or her travels in a logical, attractive format, one that will be very pleasing when read again later."
4,Not Bad,"Planning a vacation, need to get orgainized ? Well this book helps alot, write down plans and appointments as well as things to do before you leave. i recommend this to anyone who is taking a trip and can have trouble getting orgainized"
2,Does not stand up to civilian use,"I am very disappointed with this watch! I received one as a gift almost three years ago. I took about two years to decide it was worth asking for. The first year, the watch was great. The dial is easy to read, it is very waterproof, and those luminous markings are bright. But during this past year, the numbers on the outer dial wore off, and one of the watch pin holes got scuffed (I guess from catching my arm on my backpack or a sleeve once too often) so the watch pops off all the time. I sent it back to Luminox (Parsec) and they said it would cost $136 to fix. So much for Luminox."
4,"Excellent, historical, entertaining","The Hungry Tiger CD _Before the Rainbow_ is excellent and I recommend it highly. I might (or might not) have preferred ""period instruments"" to the synthesizer, but then it would have cost too much to produce and we'd be without anything. My roommate/landlady said the final grand march from Patchwork Girl sounded like ""roller skating music."" But that was intended as a compliment. No Oz fan can live without this recording."
5,Sterling Silver Key pendents,"I bought three of these for three very dear friends for Christmas. They are just the right size. I bought an 20"" chain for each of them and it worked and looked great."
4,very good quality,The good thing about this is that it looks EXACTLY like the picture. I do mean exactly. Even the size is the same as the pic give or take a few mm. I would have loved for the key to be bigger but it's not amazons fault that I didn't know how much 1 1/6 in really was. overall it is great and i've had it for a couple of months now and it still looks brand new.
4,Smaller than expected.,"It was a lot smaller than i thought it would be. It's a little bit bigger than a quarter. But it's good and sturdy, very good quality. I love my little key :)"
4,Great Necklace!,I was very excited to receive this as a gift in my Christmas stocking today. This is a great necklace at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend it to everyone!
3,Wimpy Whisk,"The Calphalon Nylon Balloon Whisk works okay if you have to smooth out a sauce that is cooking in a nonstick pot. However, the 12-inch size is not the best for whipping egg whites. I use a 14-inch French Balloon wire whisk and an unlined copper bowl for this purpose. I like the looks of all the black Calphalon nylon utensils and keep them in a tall crock near my stove. This utensil is not used very often, so I would buy the others first (the flat nylon whisk does work for scrambling eggs in a nonstick pan though)."
2,Ive used better.,This item is nice but Ive had better.I know a wisk should besomewhat flexable.However for mixing large batches of cake batter and or even a smaller size by hand.This item is extremly to flexable and messy.Its handle is hard to grip on to aswell.I would not buy this item again.
1,Can't handle the heat,"Before I go on, let me say I have lots of Calphalon products and only have had a disappointment in this utensil and the Pasta fork. Same reason on both, they are wimpy & overheat, not as in getting to hot to handle, but they become to weak to use. They do not hold up well under heat. The whisk is also not very sturdy where it need to be, at the bottom of the handle so you have support and a better grasp to beat your eggs, or whatever. I went out and bought a different one."
4,Just Fine,"I purchased this item several months ago to use with my T-Fal cookware.I found it very useful and am still quite satisfied with it.My nonstick cookware is not the type you can use metal utensils on,so that is why I bought this whisk.I use it mainly to stir soups and gravies with.The whisk is not stiff enough to easily whip egg whites ,or stuff like that,and it was slightly overpriced I thought,after I got it.That is the only reasons I gave it a four star rating instead of a five star rating"
2,Too flimsy to be of help,"It is a great concept but the nylon is not rigid enough to be of much help in the kitchen. In order to be the least bit effective I find it necessary to hold it below the handle at the small end of the balloon. Yes, that means my hand is in whatever I am trying to mix! Not a tool worth having. This and its flat whisk mate are the only Calphalon disappointments that I have had."
5,Perfect for engineering majors,This book has everything you would expect for engineering. A must have for Engineering majors. And it's cheep!
1,Cereal boxes are more entertaining,"A larger eyesore at the price of $ I have not seen (or read). Truly, this is one of the most dismal books I have had the misfortune to read in a long time. Im not sure what game this author is refering to, but it surely isnt Baldurs Gate. TSR and the Forgotten Realms license should be ashamed of itself to corrupt its license by publishing this accursed book, out the window it goes."
1,Written by a four year old?,"I am shocked that this book has received such high reviews! I can only assume that the main character's tendency toward evil acts is the cause of this (dude, this Abdel rocks man! He aint a wus like that dude he kills!)... you know people like this? If you do and they annoy you, you will hate this book. If you ARE one and you enjoy watching your friends play Mortal Kombat just for the sake of the blood, then you may like this book. Not much like the game at all, and certainly not consistent with the bright, heroic feel of the Realms. Very disappointing and poorly written. I think Abdel is a re-hash of Athans' character from the game ( I also agree with the other reviewer from South Carolina who feels the author has a crush on Jaheria... sick huh?)"
1,A Stinker,"I can't believe how rotten this book was. The characters were flat, the dialogue was stuttering and just plain stupid, especially all the ""Abdel, I'm..."" from Jahiera throughout the whole book. It takes almost the whole book for her to finish that sentence! Call me crazy, but those unfinished sentences seems like page filler to me. The story just stumbled all over the place, sudden jumps from sitting around a fire making plans, to gruesome battle scenes in the matter of a few sentences. These cuts from one place to another aren't smooth at all and make no sense in some places. And the ending....oh my what an ending. ""Bad guy dead. The End."", except there's no ""The End"". It just stops right there, with all the loose ends blowing in the breeze. It feels unfinished in more ways than one. I've played some of the game, and even though the game has a slow start to it, it isn't anywhere near to being this bad."
1,Painfully bad,"I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the worst book I've ever read. I understand that most people reading the reviews of this book will think to themselves, ""Of course it's bad. It's the novelization of a video game. I want a throwaway trash read, not high literature."" I'm saying it's bad by those standards. If a list of the worst published English language novels were compiled this book would probably be on it.At this point you can buy Baldur's Gate for a penny plus S&H.; It's not worth the money. If someone gave you a copy it wouldn't be worth the money."
3,interesting reviews...,"I was trying to get a sense of what this novel was about and so I checked the reviews and was slightly amused to find 43 reviews rampant with idiocy. Its fairly obvious that one particulary stupid individual has spent a large amount of time writing extremist reviews, in different names, of some obsure book based off a computer game. Most of the discussion seems to be about insulting the other readers (which I suppose I am guilty of) or comparing the author to Hittler. I would suggest that both sides of this debate (if that is an accurate label for a discussion so warped by stupidity) should perhaps find better outlets for their childhood aggressions and discontinue doing situps under parked cars."
5,You can't put it down!!!,Baldur's gate is a work of art; a perfectly crafted peice of science-fiction & fantasy literature that will revolutionize the world!!! Philip Athans' masterpiece will be his weapon as he takes over the world with fascination!!!
5,Baldurs Gate: A novelization,"This book is awesome. It sums up the entire game with 249 pages. With interesting twists and turns in the storyline, you can't let go of this book. Virtually every sequence in this game is mentioned in the book, wether just slightly, or in large detail. The book is based on Abdel, an adoptee of Gorion, a monk of Candlekeep. When Gorion is killed by a band of hired sellswords, Abdel rushes to find the culprit. He joins up with several people along the way, including an insane wizard, a comical halfling, a neurotic fighter, and a beutiful warrior. Its an really good book. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes the game, Forgotten Reals books, or D&D. It sucks that Xan dies..."
4,Not bad at all...,"... THIS IS NOT THAT BAD OF A BOOK... Now, if your over 19, YOU SHOULD'NT BE READING THIS BOOK ANYWAY ...I'm 14 years old and a MAJOR FAN of BG. This book may go off the plot a little bit but hey, it gives some great descriptions and will keep you hooked! Don't listen to these other reviews! This is a good book and i compliment the author! Go get this book, it's worth it!"
1,"No more, mr. Athans.","This book was the worst book i have ever read. The characters were unfinished - more like name and a short dialogue by that name between constant and mindless battles. There were no descriptions about anything - the city was just a city and differed from another city only by a name. The author has managed to ruin a good adventure and good theme by his unskilled and strongly boring writing. I truly hope, that this will be his last book."
3,Pulp trash but enjoyable - quick read,"I suspect that the only reason this book ever saw the light of day is because Philip Athans is the Wizards of the Coast ""Forgotten Reams"" editor. There are certainly more talented writers. Baldur's Gate wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it certainly was a ""loose"" adaption of the computer game...too loose. Definitely better than the forgettable ""Against the Giants"" by uber-hack Ru Emerson or the all-to quick ""Pool of Radiance, but not up to the enjoyable ""White Plume Mountain"" sequence. Try those first before bothering with this one."
1,Waste of paper!,unlike the original RPG this book is extremely lame and boring. The characters are flat and unreal. I was very dissapointed.
1,Disgustingly bad writing,"Maybe it was a mistake to read this book immediately after reading Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" for the first time, but this book was truly horrible. It was very choppy and lacked flow. The main character was one of the least likable I've ever seen, and I truly didn't care whether his entrails were sucked out by spiders or not. And anyone who's played the magnificent game of Baldur's Gate should agree with this: Athans really should have gotten Minsc into the book somehow. :)"
1,The Worst Video Game Novelization,"Imagine some of the worst fanfics you've ever seen, and you can get a good idea of what this piece of crap is.Want an idea of how bad this is? Most of the BG characters die within the first third of the book just so the romantic leads can bone. I'm not joking, I wish I was.Beyond that, the writing is about average for something on Fanfiction.net. A multitude of run on sentences, no understanding of grammar, more typos and misspellings than you could even care to keep track of... I refuse to believe this had an editor.Avoid this book like the plague, especially if you're a fan of the game. Ignore the few 5-star reviews, they're all voted as unhelpful for a good reason: They're not telling the truth. I'm willing to believe several actually have ties to the book. Not that I'm not willing to believe this book doesn't have a fanbase, I mean even the worst Troma films have fans, but a lot of the five-star reviews just sound fake."
1,Absolutely Horrid!,"I'm not going to be so condescending as to say that people who gave this book a positive review are of lesser intelligence. I will simply assume they are joking.The most polite word I can use to describe the plot is ""jagged"". If you want to get a feel for the plot, I want you to imagine playing hop-scotch. Now, erase the boxes and start hopping around randomly. Don't describe it or use helping words, just do it. Have your friends randomly throw blood and guts on you while spouting inane sexual innuendos. Keep hopping around - that's the key.There, you've just experienced the book and saved yourself some money.All of the negative reviews have already detailed this novel better than I ever could. I really just wanted to do my part in getting the overall rating down to where it belongs."
3,So It's Not Classic Literature...,"Baldur's Gate is not going to replace the Dark Elf Trilogy on your bookshelf. But it is entertaining for a while, and watching the characters develop is interesting enough. I would place it about even with the Star Wars X-Wing novels. Cheap, pure entertainment for those times when one just doesn't want to think too much."
4,Great story but missing a few things.,"This novelization of Baldur's Gate is fantastic! The story is solid, the characters true, and the consistency memorable.The only thing about this book I don't like is the lack of important events or people from the game mentioned in the book. Here are a few examples:1. Imoen didn't join the party in the beginning. 2. Abdel should have run away from the original fight, not fought in it, also mentioning that Sarevok should have been in the original fight with Tamoko. 3. Where's Elminster on the way to The Friendly Arms and going into Baldur's Gate? 4. Where's the doppelgangers impersonating everyone under Candlekeep? 5. Where's Xan's Moonblade? 6. Where's Drizzt? Everyone knows you can really summon Drizzt. (A cameo appearance by Drizzt would've completely made this story!) 7. Others...The book is worth reading, the love between Abdel and Jaheira well written, but a few important things (to me, anyway,) were left out.Ash"
5,"funny, fun, fast, and furious","If you're looking for a fun, entertaining fantasy book thatdoesn't babble on and on about background and blah blah blah mythologythis and that, but gewts going right away, maintains a fast pace, andends the second it should this is well worth the short time it'll take to read this quirky book. Novelizations of computer games are destined to be bad -- based on stories written by computer programmers -- but this book actually has fun with its own flaws. The people who have flamed it ... were obviuosly expecting some Robert Jordan epic or something ... whatever it was they WAY missed the point. I'll buy the sequel!"
1,Absolute Drek... I'd rate it lower if I could...,"I've read many of the AD&D novels prior to this one. I liked the game and the article in Dragon Magazine interested me enough to pick up this novel even though I'm hesitant to pick up anything based on a computer game (anyone remember the Doom novels?). This sets new standards for the word ""suck"". I got to within three chapters of the end of the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Don't buy this book unless you need it for burning in your furnace or your pet parakeet desperately needs liner for his cage."
1,What a horrible book!,"Buy this if you enjoy Jerry Springer for intellectual reasons, if not... STAY AWAY!"
3,I don't see what all the negativity is about...??,"Ok, first off I'm only 6 chapters into the book so far but after seeing all the ""horrible reviews"" I had to chime in.I'm can be a ""picky"" reader. I read 99.9% fantasy. This book isn't that bad. I may re-review it when I'm done and probably give it another star.I've played the games but not all the way through, so It's nice to have ""some"" background here. Even if you never played the games it would still be enjoyable.Is it perfect so far? No. But it's not terrible either.Ren"
2,One of the worst TSR novels ever,"I hope this book was written in haste to go along with the computer game. Man, what a lemon. Athans either had a great deal of restrictions on him to follow the game story or just not enough time to write at least a descent novel. If all of his writing are similar to ""Baldur's Gate"", then he should consider writing novels for the ""Death Dealer"" series.(Well, I can't say that he is bad enough to be put in the ""Death Dealer"" catagory, but he is very close to it.)"
4,Amatuer Author,"This probably wasn't the best pick of author, Abdel was at beginning and through the whole beginning of his life, to boot, a huge murderer, also... the author gives away Abdels love way to fast, he sees a guys wife and loves her, loves her so much that he kills her husband??? i dont know how many girls out there would like him anymore, bringing him back to life or not. The author starts the book off written much like the Hobbit *(Which i didn't enjoy his writing style)* but slowly... at about page 30 it turns into a novel, yet the Abdel still gets mad at everyone for talking about his father, even if nothing really makes him mad. Wish he had planned more on the character profile, it was an interesting read. I would recommend this, and I have.*No i havent played the game"
3,Reviewers are really missing something!,"Baldur's Gate:A Novelization will never live up to be a popular book,a book that lives up to the game,or the best book since the bible(as some reviewers have said).This is just a book to get you familiar with the Forgotten realms fantasy world.The reviewers here are missing the point.Some of the reviewers didnt even finish the book.In my opinion,this book was very fast and very fun.I wasn't ready to read such a complicated book like ""Dune:House Atriedies"" so instead, I read a simple,fast,and energetic book like this.Sure,there were some things that were in the game that were not in the book, but if Mr.Athans put every little moment from Prolouge to Chapter 7 in the game,the book would be about 700 pages,and not a mere 246.Mr.Athans,since this is your first book,maybe a little warning,but at least you did your best."
2,"Some Good Ideas, But a Lot Of Rediculous Ones Too","Somehow I just don't see myself breaking into a crypt to spend the night sleeping with a rotting corpse in order to attune myself with the ""death energy"". I did a 30 days in county jail once & I'm not too keen on the idea of going back just to connect myself to this ""death energy"". Not to mention, the smell can't be all that great. Phoohey! I don't quite see the point in ritual golem construction either. BTW, don't believe the guy who says he's got an army of golems doing his house work, he's full of it, they don't do anything."
3,Necromantic Ritual Book,"This book is not about Necromancy, it is a book about Necromantic practices. It's a book intended to ""align one's soul with the Death Energy"". Simply put: To get to know Death better. I will not practice the rituals in this book, because I am not comfortable with kissing or sleeping with a dead person. It does have an interesting section on Ritual Sculpting. It provides the elements to bring to life a sculpture, but it requires parts of a dead body. The only thing I really liked about the book is that it has a ""Sorcerer's Handbook"" atmosphere that surrounds it. In short, I am glad to add this book to my unique library."
1,Good For a Laugh,"I was looking for something serious and ... after reading the whole book, I felt that the whole thing was a joke."
2,a great book,obiously this book is not for the people who had a intelectual coeficient inferior to the average. so if you are not in occult don't buy it or don't review something you don't know or have the guts to practice!
1,How Can Anyone Give Praises for This Book??,"After reading this thin book, I cannot imagine how people can believe the stuff inside. The part about sleeping with a corpse... Death Energy and golem construction... if you ask me, to be frank, it is all utter nonsense to me.Such a book doesn't deserve any place in my home..."
4,this book should not to be taken seriously...,"I give this four stars simply because it was entertaining to read. I haven't decided of the author actually takes her self seriously or if she wrote this as a spoof. Anyway, I thought it was amusing as fiction but those who take this book seriously need to be bopped on the head a couple of times...no offence. One thing that did irritate me was the horrible font this book is written in. My gosh, it's an eyestrain. On the plus side, there are gothic pictures thrown about here and there and the wording is very poetic, in a morbid way."
4,Another Strong Release,"This is another one in the series of strong releases for the Kinks during this time period. There is a selection of short melodic pop songs, some are exceptional. ""Sitting On My Sofa"" features strong vocal interplay by the Davies brothers, ""Till the End of the Day"" is a Kinks classic that still stands the test of time, anchored by a distinctive Dave guitar riff, ""Where Have All the Good Times Gone"" and ""Dedicated Follower of Fashion"" are also Kinks classics, showcasing Dave's killer guitar and Ray's lyrical wit. I recommend this one strongly!"
4,good one,"Where else can you get the original ""Where have all the good times gone"" and ""Milk Cow Blues"""
2,"Unfortunately, a muddy mix version","Getting to the point, this version of the album on the Sanctuary label boasts a nice package but the mix is very muddy. I don't remember if this was how the original 1966 album sounded but this is not what you want from a ""remastered"" cd. I also just aquired the Lola versus Powerman cd on the Castle-Essential Records label and the mix is pristine. Since these were both released in America on the Reprise record label in the 60's I assume the Castle-Essential records cd version of Kink Kontroversy might be quite a bit better mix-wise."
3,Could Have done without,"This book is also required by my college for this course. It has some helpful tidbits but after reading 2 other sperate sources to make a ""complete"" picture you dont have the engery to color the pictures. I honestly think I could have done without this book and saved some money."
3,"Its helpful, but not as good as other coloring books","After using the Anatomy and Physiology coloring books, when I got to Micro I thought, I need this. The coloring books in general are VERY helpful. I am a visual learner, so this helps me follow confusing concepts easily. The Microbiology book is somehow, lacking explanation on the coloring pages in my opinion. It has lengthy explanations on the left page, but sometimes it seems that you can't follow as easily which is the reason I purchase the books."
3,Twisted Whiskers,"Good, well-writtten book that covers & explains all the ways our cats interact with each other. It offers solutions to the problems that inevitably come up. I would recommend this book."
3,Not what I thought,This book has some good ideas about cat behavior but some of it was also wayyyyy off base. If you get this take it with a grain of salt as not all of the opinions expressed are based on fact.
3,Don't buy it with 'Cat vs Cat'!,I have a multicat household and one of my kitty has a socialization problem while there is a predator in the house and one that is being continuously picked upon.I bought two books thinking 'Twisted Whiskers' will help me solve the former while the 'Cat vs. Cat' will help me solve the latter.It turns out that these two books are almost identical. They have same chapters with some updates on the 'twisted whiskers'.
5,As New,"I received this document in double quick time. It is in pristine condition, not a mark or flaw on it. It is in French and English which is what I required.For a second hand Libretto it is just like a new book off the shelf. I am delighted with it."
2,"Definitely a dropoff from ""Swansong for You""","You have to admire bands that offer three unreleased tracks on their singles as B-sides. Sometimes, such as with R.E.M.'s ""Automatic for the People,"" the B-sides are as good as the album material. Other times, this happens. The title song, ""Falling from Grace,"" is excellent, as is nearly all of ""Swansong for You,"" the album it's taken from. The other three tracks on this single, though, are obviously songs that didn't make the album -- for good reason. ""October Skies"" is OK, but the other two aren't even pleasant to listen to. Considering that The Gentle Waves' music is all about pleasant listening, that's a bit of a disappointment."
3,Buddhist Music of the Ming Dynasty,"This album is good. It may give you some relaxation moments after working hard. If you practice meditation, it can be used to help you to concentrate on your meditation. I sometimes use this type of music to practice mindfulness."
1,Not worth the price,"I have spent a lot of time looking for a new pasta/soup/stew pot and settled on this one. What a disappointment! The handles on the pot and the lid get red hot after just a few minutes on the stove. The non-stick interior is a joke. Pasta cooked in water sticks to the bottom. Save your money and if you find a good pasta/soup/stew pot, let me know."
1,Not Very High Quality,"This cable would not work well with two VGA to analog video converters I bought. I suspect faulty shielding. The converters worked fine with an older cable I had.Update:2013I eventually just threw this junk away. I had nothing but trouble with it. I don't recommend it at all. The connectors fit loosely, the shielding is defective and I kept getting either a poor signal or no signal at all. It was a bad cable. Don't buy it."
3,Streak Free,This stuff seems to be a little different than the usual junk you buy at wal-mart or whatever but I still don't think it is worth the price.The manufacturers have us scared to death that the least little thing will destroy our precious digital cameras or their sensors. I don't think I will buy this again.
1,Eclipse leaves streaks!,"Long story short, I kept getting extremely frustrated trying to clean my filters. I used the Eclipse Cleaning Solution and pads. The more I would try to clean the more streaking I would get. I then tried some samples of Zeiss Lens Cloths. The streaking was gone immediately. The Zeiss cloths are sold in a pack of 50 for $2.99 at Walmart vision center. I thought I was doing something wrong, but it turns out it was just a bad product."
4,Works well but....,This cleaner works well for CCD sensors on my D200 but I realized that there is TIN oxide coating with the later generation CMOS sensors for D300 and Nikon D3 that might not be very compatible with this cleaner....hence I have not used this anymore. I am now using E2 for the newer generation nikon cameras.
2,May not be what you expect.,"If you're looking for the percussive music genre Tektekan, then you're better off withThe Music of Bali, Vol. 3: Kecak & Tektekan.This is a recording of a dance drama, what you mostly hear is voices that declaim the dialog. There is also some simple percussion, with a small ensemble of bamboo slap sticks which play a just one simple sounding rhythm. Main musical interest is at the points where the rhythm ends slightly chaotically, which reveals that simple pulse is actually made up of a typical balinese type interlocking rhythm.Sound quality is good, just a stereo mic pointed at the performance, what makes this cd less inpressive is that it's not a recording of a musical performance."
3,Que libro tan aburrido,"El tema de la politica latinoamerica me gusta mucho. Pero este libro de Montaner, aunque tiene sus ideas muy claras, es escrito de una manera super aburrida. Nunca lo he podido terminar de leer."
3,Replacement Phone Battery,Battery seems to work just fine. The placement of the connector and connector wire caused the connector to disengage when the phone cover was replaced. Otherwise it is a good product.
1,does not work,"Rating should be zero stars.I ordered two BT-800 batteries and received them Feb 1, 2010. One of them would only hold a charge for about 2 minutes. I sent emails Feb 10, Feb 12, and Feb 17 requesting a replacement and/or and RMA to send the defective battery back.As of Feb 20, 2010 I have not gotten any response.Purchasing from this vendor seems to be pot luck with no customer service. I would not recommend this seller."
3,"Flavor, not flower","Tea was good, better than some other flowering brands. The flower show though, was uninspiring at best. The quality of the flowers left a lot to be desired."
5,Great price for good product,"I was really pleased with the quality of the tea - tastes as good as the fancy store at the mall. Love the packaging and that each tea blossom is sealed to keep it fresh. So delicate and perfect for tea parties! A good tea for little girls, very mild and fragrant."
5,It was just amazing to see the flower open slowly in hot water.,"It was just amazing to see the flowers opened slowly in hot water. I brought a box for my daughter, who gave it to my wife as a Mother's Day present. My wife was so happy to see the flowers opened. My daughter was so amazed, and video taped the whole process to show her friends. The only thing I want to add is, a few of flowers did not open as nicely as the others. But still, each of them gave us exciting moments."
3,Primula gift set,"There was a nice assortment of teas, but when the flowers ""bloomed"" they looked nothing like they do on the picture. There were no vibrant colors, very drab... dead looking. The tea did have an OK flavor, but not worth the extra $$$ in my opinion."
5,Primula assorted flowering tea,"I just love the flowering teas from Primula, they are not only delicious, they are absolutely beautiful. Especially when you use a clear glass cup.The price can't be beat either. Normally they cost as much as $25 for a can of 12, At under $15, it's the best deal on the net"
5,Wonderful gift. I'm now a lifetime fan of this tea.,"I disagree with the person who said the teas look nothing like the package. I wonder if they got a bad batch. I also received the Numi set and it never showed a flower. But the Primula Gift set is wonderful. The green leaves unfurled and revealed flowers with red and sometimes white blooms. Not sure how they accomplished that, but the display has got my children begging to drink tea.The flavors are nice, similar to what I am served in asian restaurants. I like the taste better than name brand boxed teas. I also like that the flavor is maintained even after adding hot water for a third steep.I received the Primula set as a gift and I'm addicted to the flavor and the appearance! Highly recommend this product."
2,Space Alien Weird Not Kidding,"It would be nice to say I liked this tea but I don't. In an absurd sort of way, it frightens me. The flower does not open till it reaches boiling point and it does *not* resemble Jasmine at all. It has brown tentacles on a black core that floats in a sinister way. If you wait too long to drink it, the taste is vile.Perhaps my Jasmine tea is not just old but dead. So I drink an alien corpse in the name of health and happiness.I do not feel happy and pray Space Aliens will not erupt from my stomach like Susan Sarandon's.If I am not heard from again, be careful.Aliens may have landed."
4,More for show than drinking,"Although you can drink the jasmine tea, I bought these for the show. I place a bulb in a glass tea pot or a large balloon wine glass for display as the flower unfolds. You need patience for this. I first saw this in Shanghai and they are on display all around the airports in China. Jasmine is a green tea but scented. The flowers are an addition to a relaxing moment with a cup of tea."
2,not well made,bought several. two fell apart as I pulled them out of the wall outlets. these are jus not well constructed; doesn't seem like it should be a major production challenge to make something like this well; they are charging enough to expect a well made product. . . .
5,No more frozen pipes,I purchased this thermostat so I wouldn't have to keep my pump house light on all the time or run up when the temp was projected to go below freezing and cut it on. Put a small electric heater in the pump house and connected it through this device. Have had no more frozen pipes since.Farm Innovators TC-3 Cold Weather Thermo Cube Thermostatically Controlled Outlet - On at 35-Degrees/Off at 45-Degrees
3,Thermostatic Plug,"This is probably a good product, but I haven't been able to test it because it requires a ""flat"" (flush to the wall) outlet to insert the wide, two-plug item. All our outdoor electrical outlets have the required plastic surrounds and covers to protect them from rain, and this product does not fit inside the plastic surround. It does have to be outdoors to respond to the weather temperatures."
5,Does what it says,"Clicks on at 35 deg and off at 45... Chickens seem to appreciate the heat lamp it controls, though it's kind of hard to get them to fill out the customer satisfaction survey. They just keep pecking at it and crapping all over it..."
5,"Works Great, Warm Chickens","I got this cube for my chicken's radiant heat coop heater and heated water dispenser. I loved that it had two outlets, as this was exactly what I needed. It works great, comes on as the temperature drops, and goes off as designed. Great energy saver and no worries for keeping my chickens warm!"
1,Really bad,"First I had a hard time plugging the cube in. The ground prong is not shaped right or too long or something. Plus it wiggles around and that didn't fill me with confidence. Then I tried to plug a lamp into it (the lamp did not have a ground prong) and that broke the little clips on the inside. Then I looked into the other plug and saw that its clips were already out of place. I don't know if that is bad assembly or design.I have two other ones, in other temperature ranges but I don't know if I would trust them- even if I could get something to plug into it."
3,Only game in town,"I bought this to support a heated birdbath, also bought from Amazon. Not much competition for this type of product.In theory (I didn't test it), it goes on only when the temps head toward freezing or below, then shuts off as things warm up.My gripe is the ground electrode came off inside the female end of an extension cord.Fortunately, the manufacturer sent me a new one immediately after I sent an email with photo.I've not removed the replacement from the extension cord (spring's not quite here) yet, so we'll see. BTW, the ground electrode is noticeably thicker than many - you might want to crimp it a bit with pliers (it's u-shaped)."
2,not all that great...,Idk maybe I got.a defective one but its suppose to turn on at 78 and.off at 72 but when I look at my thermometer it gets up to the low 80s before it.kicks on and then seems to never shut off it'll be 67 and still be running my fans. I does work but the temp range its suppose to work in is a lil.miss leading also seeing how this only goes off temp when the fans are off your humidity skyrockets...
5,Thermoly controlled circuit,"I wanted light bulbs to heat my pump house when the temps were below freezing. Not needing them on all the time I decided to build a temperature controlled circuit. Searching out the parts I needed, I figured I could make one for a little under $30. Then I found this one for about half the price and already made. It works great. Just what I needed."
5,Dog saver!,"This is a great concept, and it works! I don't know how long it will work, but it is simple, so I think that it will. I use it with heat lamps for my dogs, and they seem to appreciate the extra heat. The heat lamps heat the surface and not the air of the room, so they are very effective."
2,Works alright,You just have to give it a little leeway in the temp if you have it against the house and the pets are not.
5,works like it should.,i keep my livestock meds in the well house in the summer. cool in the summer but too cold in winter. i normally use a heat lamp in the winter to keep water fittings from freezing even though it is insulated. with this device i save energy and can keep meds at prescribed storage temps as well. worth the money
1,Couldn't use because it does not fit our outlets,Cannot use because it does not work in our outlet--There was no way to use it. We will see if we can figure something out for next season.
2,I can't depend on it,"Seems to be overly sensitive to overload, or may be sensing its own heat, anyway it was not dependable on both on and off cycle."
3,"Works, sort of","These cubes seem to have a mind of their own -- some work, some don't for the intended temperature range. I don't totally trust them for anything vital."
3,In test mode phase.,I have bought two of these. One for the Chicken Coop and one for the Travel Trailer. We'll see how they work this winter.
3,Second try,"It appears that the second try is the trick. The replacement product appears to work. However, it will be next year that I will be able to use it."
3,did not fit into my outdoor outlet's rain-guard housing,"I bought this product to go with my outdoor cat-house and heated bed. In theory, this is a very ingenious and useful accessory. It has great reviews and I am sure it works great. However, I did not think to check my outdoor outlet on the side of my house to see make sure it would fit in the rain-guard housing... it does not! It is my fault for not checking, I should have done that. However, if you have an outdoor outlet with the clear plastic rain-guard (which I believe almost all most newer homes have), this product might not fit..! The back of this product where you plug it into your outlet has the plug dead-center...therefore the ""sides"" of this will not fit within the clear plastic housing that covers my outdoor outlet. This product is made for outdoors, so I do think they should take the construction and size of this into consideration. If that is not an issue for you, then I say buy this product! But Check your outlet first!! : )"
5,Handy Helper,"The thermo cube is working perfectly, it turns on automatically so my bird bath de-icer can do its job, then turns off when the temp rises and the de-icer is not needed. As our nights have been anywhere from -10 degrees to +25 degrees this winter, and many days above freezing, it has been a blessing not to have to remember to turn on/turn off the de-icer. Needless to say, the birds are happy!"
2,Worked but not very long,I used this last winter but now it has stopped working. Very disappointed that it only lasted 1 year (actually only during the cold weather months).
1,does not work,"I purchased this for my hen house. It was nearly impossible to plug it in to the extension cord, and has not worked yet. At first I thought the coop was warm enough that it wasn't needed, so added a thermomoter and on this very cold (6 degree) morning the thing still has not kicked on and it is well below 20 in there. Don't waste your money"
2,Great idea but did not work for some reason,"Great idea for a product. Unfortunately, product did not work as promised. I read somewhere that it uses air pressure to operate, and I am at around 5000ft altitude; so I am not sure if this affected its operation. Too bad, as this product would have been very useful."
5,Great Product - Wish there was more range,Wonderful idea and a great product.I know there are two sets of ranges for both cold & hot but I wish there were even more. On at 40F off at 50F would have been perfect for me. Any possibility it could be made adjustable? Now that would be perfect!!!
3,"Does what it says, but poor design for an outside outlet.","Seems to work as stated, but if you have a use for this in an outside recepticle as I did,(heated water bowel and a bird bath heater), then reconsider!! All my outside outlets have a metal weather cap an the top and this cube is too large and hits the weather cap, so it does not plug all the way into the outlet. Bigtime unsafe seeing the prongs exposed!! Cost half as much as what I paid for the thing to send it back so I found a very short, but HD outside extension cord and plugged that in to the recepticle and the cube into that. Then put it in a waterproof bag sealing it up. Better than letting the prongs hanging out. Someone really dropped the ball when they designed this for ""outside"" use! They should have designed this body slimmer on the top."
5,Really works!,"I looked for years for something like this to help protect my frost-sensitive plants! I have been using it with C9 Christmas lights and a cover (sheet, blanket or pool cover) on my plants and haven't lost one plant since. It has saved me a lot of money since I don't have to put the lights on a timer all night long like I used to. It's really worth buying!"
3,Needs GFI,Advertising for this ptroduct did not indicate that a GFI receptacle was required.Only found this out upon receipt of the item. I would like to have known about this beforehand.
1,Two dead in a row?,"The product itself is great. I am not sure why I would have gotten TWO dead in a row. The packages are easy open type so it is hard to say if they were defective from the factory or if they were misused and burned up due to overload, then returned and restocked. I took these babies down into the teens and they did not come on. I got one and AMAZON replaced it a rush speed with a second(both DEAD). Amazons service is as expected, rock solid. I am now sending back two and I will get what I need elsewhere. I simply don't want to repeat this a third time. I suggest the stock be tested for a bad run or other problem. Amazon is so easy to deal with, I am not mad...how could I be? The great thing about Amazon is the ease with which they handle such issues. My review of Amazon's service is FIVE STARS. The product itself when working is great too. I simply can't rate dead product with anything more than one star."
3,Seems to work,Plug did not fit properly in our outdoor outlet. We had to use an extension cord from outlet and then plug into extension cord. Seems to be working.
5,COLD WEATHER OUTLET WITH A THERMOSTAT,This is a great project. I have purchased 3 last year and 1 this year to control the heat tapes and well shed heater that use to run all day and night. I have saved so much money that it paid for these items in one months time. This is highly recommended if you need to prevent pipes from freezing or need to heat a sensitive area. The built in thermostat kicks in when it gets to 35 degrees and turns off at +/-42 degrees.
1,do not work,this is the worst product i ever order does not work is rate it 30 on and 40 off its 50 outside and still on
2,Not sure if this is the standard for all of them,The outlet prong broke off the first time I plugged it in so I never even really had a chance to use it.
1,Garbage,"Bought 2 of these. One quit working, the other one developed a lose prong on the plug(was not rough with it). More Farm Innovators junk. Not the first product from them I've had go bad, but I guarantee it will be the last. NEVER buying any Farm Innovators junk again."
1,Does not wrok as advertised,"I have tried this unit several times to regulate the activation of a dog water dish heater. It does not seem to permit current to go to the bowl until the temp is well below 35F and blocks current at temps below freezing and so on some cold nights the bowl heater does not come on to keep the water liquid. I have monitored the unit's on/off activity independently of the heated water dish, so I know the problem is with the ""Weather Thermo Cube"" and not the water dish. I am required to manually plug and unplug the water dish to use the heated water dish. I cannot recommend the Thermo Cube."
1,Doesn't work at all,"Bouight 2 of the to work with the heater wires on my roof. Supposed to come on at 35' and off at 45'. Neither one came on even when the temperature was 20'. Won't buy them again. Amazon wants me to pay shipping to return them, too costly to return. AMazon needs to check out what they are selling BEFORE they sell it! Very Dis-satisfied!"
2,On at 20 off at 30 - NOT,"Like other reviewers, I found this product was significantly inaccurate. I tested it with a light plugged into it so I could see clearly if it was on or off. The temperature got down to 15 degrees and it didn't come on.Thanks, Amazon, for the easy return."
2,worked for two years,It worked for two seasons heating the bird bath then quit. Purchased locally but will be upgrading to a nicer unit today after reading the reviews. Will try a heater with a thermostat built into the heater unit.
3,"1st one failed out of box, 2nd one works","The first unit was bad right out of the box. I requested a replacement.The return proccess was very easy, and the second unit arrived very quickly and it works as advertised-I think-It hasn't been above 45 degrees for a long time."
1,You get what you pay for...,The first time I tried to use this the ground plug broke off in the extension cord. Not sure if my extension cord tried to eat it or if this device is just a piece of junk. Going to try a more substantial device. Would not recommend for freeze protection given the number of negative reviews and my own experience.
3,Hit or Miss,"Bought two to control window fans in my attic. The idea is to run window fans to exhaust the hot air from my attic (which has two windows - but no roof vent like a typoical attic has). One TC-21 works perfectly, the fan turns on around 78F and goes off at 70F. The other never shuts off, the fan runs all night. It's summer and the nighttime temps have not fallen below 68 since I installed the TC-21s, so maybe it's a tolerance issue. Perhaps if it gets a little cooler it will finally turn off."
2,Not reliable.,I bought two of these. They are supposed to turn on slightly above freezing. One of them would not turn on until we'll below 20 degrees. Sent it back. A replacement arrived promptly but does not work any better.
1,Cheap,Thermo Cube construction quality is poor. The ground plug pulled out of the unit after I removed from a wall outlet on the very first use out of the package. Fortunately for Amazon replacement policy... although I am not too excited about getting another one of these. Look elsewhere. This is cheaply built / poor quality...
3,Wish it had worked.,Did not work as promised. temperature did not activate until it was much warmer than I wanted. Still have it but not in use.Too bad.
4,Product exactly as described.,"I use this device to turn on and off heat for freeze protection of water lines in our stored RV. It has now served well for several months and I will use one again, if needed."
1,Thermo Cube TC-3,"I bought this device to help regulate the my heat lamp and water font heating device in my hen house. It doesn't work. It wouldn't plug into my outdoor extension cords and when I tried it in a wall socket, it didn;t tirn either device on when it should have (the temperature dropped to the teens). Having said that, I don't know if maybe I got a lemon or what, but I wouldn't recommend it based on this experience."
1,It didn't work!,"Unfortunately, the thermocube did not work. When we went outside, the water in the electric water dish had frozen. If temps are below 45, they are not supposed to do that, the cube turns on the power. The dish itself works. The cube does not."
3,Only one works,"I bought this product to protect two palms (in different areas of yard) from sub-30 degree temps. Only one of the units work, and that was a problem because you only find that out when the temperature drops so make sure to have a backup plan in case the outlet doesn't work."
1,It does not work,"I was able to try this item once. It turned on at about 5 to 10 degrees above the stated ""on"" point and NEVER TURNED OFF. It was a total waste of money."
4,works great so far,"I ordered the Thermocube to control the heating cable I installed on my roof edge. The first frost came and the temps dropped to about 25 degrees and the cube failed. I returned it to Amazon which I am still amazed at how stress free the return process was. UPS even picked the item up at my door with the label attached which I downloaded from Amazon. The next day my replacement cube arrived and I plugged it in and so far it works fine. I took a tip from another review and plugged in two small night lights. One lets me know at a glance if the GFI has tripped or is still working, and the other lets me know when the cube has activated. I also had to remove the weather cover of the GFI in order to fit the cube but I just taped a plastic baggie over the cube and taped it around the GFI. The weather cover will just snap back on in spring. I'm going to order a back-up cube just in case this one fails. So far I am very satisfied."
1,Lasted a month at best,"Great idea but could have lasted longer than November. At least a season is a reasonable expectation. Just stopped working, which in a greenhouse could have been a disaster."
4,Check for correct temp,"I received my thermo-cube before any frost, and plugged a pond heater and aerator in to it. With our extended warm weather this year, it was not until much later that I saw that the pond was freezing over with a thin layer of ice without activation. The first really cold 17 degree F morning showed both attachments working, and on closer inspection I realized that I possessed a version of cube that was activated at 20 degrees F rather than the 35-45 degrees range I had ordered. I contacted Amazon and had the correct version shipped the next day for free, and printed out a mailing label for free return of the wrong device. The temperature activation of the device is clearly stamped on the front, I just hadn't paid attention to the existence of the different types. Both seem to work perfectly at their indicated temps. I deleted a star for the mix-up"
1,Do not like,This item does not work properly. I had a lamp plugged into it and the temperature dropped to 30 degrees F and it did not come on.
3,Useful for water but not heating pad,"I purchased this item because it was shown with the outdoor pet heated pad. Although it appears the info about the product now clearly states that it's on at 35 degrees and off at 45 degrees, that information was not readily apparent when I ordered it. I wanted something I could set myself, and this is not it. I returned the product and received a refund."
1,Never worked,Bought it for infrared heat lamp for small chicken coop. Won't work at all. Very disappointed to say the least.
1,never received,Please ck your records and note that this item was to have been a Xmas gift for my son-in-law. It was never sent. Your refunded my money.
3,authenic but needs more practice,tahitian music is to have clarity in the drumming with the combination of fast and slow. these tracks sounded too muddy for quality tahitian music. the voices are obviously authentic but they could find other singers.
4,GREAT romance/sci fi manga,"There is 8 volumes of this great book by Tokyopop and this is limited series. It is a story of people, robots, humanity and love. It is almost better than Cowboy Bebop or Oh my goddess , first books. BUY IT!"
3,Well,"well i rated this book a 3 because it haas alot of missing work.Well thats how it feels, but over all its great. Irecomend the 2nd that i would rate a five :)"
4,CHI?,GoT CHI? itz a good book READ ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITNOW!!!!!
4,Great series! Even non-CLAMP fans will enjoy it,"Sparing you the general introduction of the book, I want to note that Chobits's best quality is that the storyline is vastly different than what has been done by Clamp more well known works. It isn't a long penadantic ranting of angsting bishounen over their destiny and everyone dying.Hell, the way it's going, Tokyo Tower may even remain structurally sound by the end of it.It's reasonably light hearted and Ecchi. It's sort taking The main world of say, Clamp Campus Detectives, hitting fast forward about 100 years, and adding in the sexuality of say, Miyuki-chan in Wonderland.It's good. If you don't like Clamp, give this a chance."
4,"Chobits, a manga everyone can enjoy.","Even though my I primarily like shonen mangas, I still love Chobits. It's one of the two exceptionally good shojo mangas; the other being Fruit's Basket. A very involving storyline, with good times ahead for all. And it's only eight volumes, so collecting the whole series won't hurt your wallet too much."
4,this manga is so cute,i bought chobits because of the cover when i got to reading it that night i realised how adorible they made Chi. she is so cute eating her ice cream from her hand and doing her happy you'r home dance. they made up characters that i absouetly love and could not wait for the next issue. the ending is great and it made me cry. i cry about everything in books expecially when chi get what she wants. if you want a book that will make you smile because of the cuteness this is one to buy. oh yeah the art is fantastic too.
4,KAWAII !,"i watched the anime on youtube, but i did not read the book, but i am writing the review anyway. its about a [...] japenese boy named hideki who is trying to get in college by cram school. he is also envious that everyone else in tokyo has a beautiful computer chip dollbot thats accuratley made called a persocom, but he can't afford one. but after he gone grocery shopping, he found one in the alley. she was naked :( but wrapped in toilet paper :/. at first hideki thought she is a human girl that was raped and strangled to death. but when he saw her ears, he knew she is just a persicom. she looked like [...] blonde beauty. he took her home and turned her on. but all she could say is ""chi"" so hideki named her just that. i would like to go on, but i should not. i don't want to spoil it!TTFNcorrie"
5,my go to spatula,I've had this spatula for what seems like forever. It is still my go to spatula and looks brand new.
1,Not very useful,"I bought this book to perform some structural engineering calculations for a residential construction project. The book is filled with many (and I mean many) cases of calculations for structural loads. However, it doesn't provide the mathematics used to create each case. So, if your project is somewhat different than the example, there is no information provided to adapt the case to your situation."
3,i like calculating from scratch....,"looked at it briefly, as i recall, it is more like a cook book, it has a bunch of formulas in it, instead of the matrix mathematics....sean fielding smithusmc"
1,Waste of money,"Very rudimentary, practically unusable. Freezes frequently even on a powerful system. Graphics are rather sad. If you add items, they never appear in the correct place (add a chair and see it hang in midair! add a refrigerator and it will always have its doors to the wall!). Takes 45 minutes to install and a half hour to uninstall. Run away and spend your money more wisely."
4,Good family fun,It is a real treat to see the flinstones first live action film if you are a fan of the cartoon series.It is a film that adults and children can enjoy together. The town of Bedrock looks great and it looks like it does in the cartoalso good playing the role ofon show.John Goodman was an excellent choice for the role of Fred. Rick Morranis is also does a good job portraing the role of Barney. The rest of the cast is also good.You also see Halley Berry have small role in the film. The sequel is not that great because the sequel is a prequel. I am not a big fan of prequels and not a fan of this one either. There is not alot of star power in this film.The kid will enjoy more than the adults. But it is kind of interesting to see how Fred and Willma first met and how they get their pet Dino. All an all this is good family fun for you and your child.
4,Great,"I remember watching the 1st Flinstones movie when I was growing up. It kinda bothers me, seeing their feet dirty. But really, I could watch the 2nd movie with friends or when I take a trip to Las Vegas."
5,make love to me,"What a wonderful collection of music. While listening to this CD, it just makes you want to move around the room with another person. The music has an erotic undertone to it that almost acts as an afrodiziac. It is definitely one that I will play while spending time with that special someone."
3,"Good concert, but DVD is a copy of the VHS","1984 concert from New Orleans shows the craft and showmanship of Kool and the Gang. James ""JT"" Taylor is a talented performer and Michael Ray is just as sparkling. Warning: if DVD is from a Brazilian source, this show is a copy of the VHS tape released in 1984 and not remixed or remastered; clarity and sound is poor, and there is an obvious omission on the DVD. ""In the Heart"" on the VHS tape was deleted and you can see where they skipped over the number. Too bad, Clifford Adams had a duet with JT on the chorus. 4 stars for the concert; but only 2 stars for the DVD. Try and buy the VHS original instead."
2,doesn't open wide enough,"I have worked in a professional kitchen and am very familiar with using tongs. These simply do not open up wide enough, (without using both hands) They only 'spring' open to about three or four inches, which doesn't allow you room to grab a whole lot. These are ineffective tongs. I ended up returning this product for the cuispro (I think is the brand) nylon tipped spatula, which I love."
2,Great until they broke,"I purchased these because I have several other Calphalon kitchen items which I have been very pleased with. I really loved these tongs until after a few months of use they snapped into! I agree with those who said the tongs are just not wide enough for all uses. One day while trying to stretch them just a smidge to fit around something, they broke in half. If I had been applying a lot of pressure, I would have understood, but that wasn't the case. Another drawback is the fact that you cannot close them for storage and they take up too much drawer space. When these broke, I replaced them with spring loaded, rubber-tipped tongs by Amco Houseworks which have worked well for me."
2,weak and useless,"The only reason this tool merited a second star was the fact that it did a good job of not scratching the nonstick surface of any of my cookware. That said, that is all it did well. It is obvious just from looking at them that they have little to no 'clamping power' like you would experience in spring-loaded tongs. These work fine for moving a few sprigs of asparagus or green beans around a pan. Forget about using these on any cut of meat or anything weighing more than a couple of ounces."
2,Somewhat clumsy tool.,I needed nylon tongs for my nonstick surface pans and these were the only pair I could find. I find them rather clumsy to use and they just don't grip very well.
1,Great until they BREAK :/,"These seem like solid, well made tongs. However, mine broke after 2 months of home use. I'm not sure what caused the tongs to weaken, but after the first month they clearly weren't as strong as they were when they were new. They gradually broke about a month later. The plastic at the fulcrum of the hinge apparently can only take a certain amount of use."
4,Must-have for non-stick pans,"At last someone has made a practical set of tongs for use with non-stick cookware. I find these tongs lightweight but sturdy and the squared-off ends are a helpful design. They work very nicely with small-to-medium bits of food. Their only drawback is that they don't have a hinged joint and spring mechanism like most metal tongs, so they can't open really wide if you need to pick up some larger food items. That is a minor quibble, though. They are 20 times better than my old wooden tongs that I used to use with my good non-stick cookware. You can pick up the thinnest slice of bacon, or even pick up a single piece of diced onion from the bottom of your pan with no trouble at all. They allow great dexterity and are strong enough for most of your needs.They are easy to clean and are dishwasher safe. Other than the limited opening ability, they would have deserved 5 stars.I highly recommend them."
3,"Good but, ....","We have a George Forman grill, which we love, but you really need to use tongs to pick up and turn the food occasionally. Since the surface is non-stick you should use wood or plastic. We went through several pairs of wood tongs (when we could find them) and they would eventually snap. These are the ONLY pair of plastic tongs I could find. They are very sturdy, BUT a little too large to be used easily. They feel a bit clumsy in my hands. I just wish I could find the plastic version of a stainless steel pasta grabber I found at Ikea years ago. It resembles tonges with teeth. They are perfect for just about everything."
1,Calphalon Tongs NO GOOD!!,"I was VERY disappointed in this item. I would actually give it 0 stars!! I tried turning a pork chop, a boneless chicken breast and even holding a baking bag open to pour contents into a serving dish and they wouldn't hold any of these things. I have thrown mine away and bought the locking metal tongs which I LOVE!!"
2,"Nice idea, bad product","What a great idea I thought, a set of tongs that wont damage my pots!True, they wont scratch your pots, but they also wont pick anything up.Please do NOT waste your money on these. They are not strong enough, or tensioned enough to pick anything other than salad.They wont close all the way on anything, and simply bend when you try to grab something solid.The ideal solution would be a set of tongs that are metal, but have rubber/plastic tips, someone please make one!"
2,Inferior to traditional tongs. Not recommended.,"These tongs are a bit hard to hold and to squeeze. More importantly, the odd-shaped business end does not hold food very well. Skip this item and buy traditional spring-loaded aluminum chef's tongs with scalloped edges, which are very reasonably priced and work very well. Or if you need to work on a non-stick surface, choose bamboo or wooden tongs. But skip these; they don't work well."
5,Great with Grilling Machines!,I gave these tongs to my mother as a Christmas present. She loves them. This makes a great addition to the George Forman Lean Mean Fat-reducing Grilling Machines because the nylon tongs will not ruin the non-stick surface.
2,Close but no cigar,"No scratches on my pans but these tongs function poorly. They work fine for vegetables and small items but meats tend to slip from the jaws, especially heavier cuts. This can pose a dangerous situation if the meat slips from the tongs back into a pan that may have extremely hot juices or liquids within the pan. A large center cut chop slid out of the tongs the first time I used them and spattered hot drippings in every direction. If you plan to use the tongs for meats I would go with another product."
3,Surprisingly difficult to use,"On the plus side: they won't scratch non-stick surfaces, they won't heat up, they're easy to clean. On the minus side: you have to pry them open wide enough to pick up anything thicker than a sausage link! These are seriously unwieldy tongs. I made pork medallions the other day and found myself using both hands to pick up one small piece of meat. Not acceptable to the point where it outweighs most of the plusses.If all you'll use this for is bacon, then you're fine. If you want to manipulate anything much thicker, get the standard metal kind that spring open wide.As a follow up: The tongs broke when I tried to pick up a pork chop. Not recommended."
3,A very good biography !,"This biography of the geat Ernst LUBITSCH is really better than the overrated book ""THE LUBITSCH TOUCH"" by WEINBERG. It is an alive book by a writer who really admire the director and the man. It also gives some good reviews and information about Lubitsch's geat films. My only complain is that the autor doesn't really develop the German period (which is still underrated and considered as ""vulgar"" - ""thanks"" to the famous critic Lotte EISNER), like all the books about Lubitsch, it focuses on the masterpierces of the 30's and the 40's (the most known period and the best of course). But buy it, if you want to know more about LUBITSCH/the man (and prefer this book to Weinberg's one). About LUBITSCH/the director, buy the excellent book by S. RAPHAELSON ""3 screen comedies"" (if you can find it !) and J. HARVEY's ""American comedies : from Lubitsch to Sturges""."
2,"Strong perfume frangrance, did not remove mascara",I don't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser. I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream. It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either. I don't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product. It's really too bad because it is a good price and I can't afford more expensive products.
2,Don't like it,"I bought this cream as a makeup remover. I don't feel like it removes makeup as well as the other removers I have had and sometimes I have to use it twice in order for my skin to feel clean. It also leaves skin feeling very oily, so you can't use it right before you put on new makeup. I feel like I can only use it right before I go to bed, because of how oily it is. It also has a very heavy rosy smell, which I don't really like. I would not buy this item again."
2,Made me Break Out!!!,"My mom has always used Pond's cold cream and she suggested I used it to remove my makeup along with cleansing my face. However, after a few days of use, I noticed that after applying the pond's cold cream, my face would start to get red and splotchy. BE CAREFUL. Even though the spots eventually went away, it annoyed me that this product didn't work for me. I am 17 years old and have normal/ dry skin. I would try sampling this product before use... I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for me."
5,"ok, it's good fun for the family.","Top-ranked in our family for playing games over the holidays when the grown kids come home. Our youngest 12 year old likes it, on through the teens and adults of the family. Good mix of strategy and chance in the draw of really colorful cards. Sub-consciously getting a better geographical idea of European cities. Depending on personalities, players can get a bit edgy when their well-plotted out 'mission' gets foiled when someone else takes their track. Me, annoyed? what? YES! But still i always want to play."
5,Fun game,"If you like any of the other Ticket to Ride games, you'll like this one too. Has a couple of rule changes that are different for this game, but not too hard to learn. Different to play each time."
5,Improved Version of TtR,"This is a great game where each player has a set of destinations they want to complete, trains to complete them, and resources/cards to build the trains. It combines collecting resources, building trains, and shortest route methods to create a fun game for the whole family.In the second installment in this game series Alan Moon addresses the issues with the first game by using long/short destinations to provide some more balance to the game. In addition the strategy of collecting longs is neutralized by the length of the trains that can be built in this version.For my friends and I this is by far our favorite version as the problems with America are fixed and the more complex/time consuming (to set up) version of Marklin have not yet been introduced."
4,More Interesting then the North American Version,"We quite enjoyed learning to play this, it's both challenging and interesting enough for kids and adults. The European version incorporates a few additional rules that make the play more interesting than the North American version: ferries, tunnels, and train stations don't exist in the North American version. Ferries and tunnels require you to accumulate additional cards to claim sections of track. Train stations let you overcome a flawed strategy by using one of your opponent's routes. We've played both the North American and European version and prefer the European version."
5,Great game,I bought this for a married daughter and son-in-law. We've played it together - we love it and they love it. This is really a fun game. It is a little better than the original ticket to ride because it adds some new twists that make it even funner.
5,"Fun game: easy to learn, easy to play...","Although, can I give it 1 star because I lost both rounds? Bah humbug! Still a really fun family-friendly game. Plus we weren't up all night like with Catan or Risk...but hey...I win those games! :-)"
5,Great Game for Board Game Lovers,"My husband and I had played the original Ticket To Ride at a friend's last summer. After playing only once, we knew we wanted to get the game. For my husband's birthday I bought him the Europe edition. We found the additions of the train stations in this version quite a helpful security blanket when someone else takes your train path---in other words, the original can be a little frustrating when that happens. Since the game play moves so quickly, we've played this game on several weeknights after dinner, and also have taken it to friend's houses to play, who also are gamers. A real neat game for any board game lover, tired of playing the usual games. A little pricey but worth the money!"
5,An outstanding family board game,"I was looking for a game to bring up north for Thanksgiving for the entire family to enjoy. My 9 and 13 year old nieces loved the game. The adults were also excited to jump in and play all weekend long. I would highly recommend this game. After 15+ years of Monopoly marathons over Thanksgiving weekend, this was a great new adventure. The learning curve takes only a couple of games, and after that, even the 9 year old was setting her strategy and working her routes."
5,Super fun!,I love this game. I could play it everyday. It is very very fun! I like playing it best with 2-3 people (it is less difficult) but the challenge with more people could also be fun. It is also a game you could play on teams (though I probably would prefer to be by myself.) It is also neat to learn all the European cities.
4,"Geography, Strategy, and Fun!","My whole family loves this game, even my busy teenagers. You receive cards and try to build trains from city to city. Others can block your route and you can either build a station to use their train or reroute. You receive points for the longest unbroken train route, for trains, and for accomplished routes. I'm learning where cities are that I've never heard of! The downside is that it takes a long time to play...it's not Monopoly, but does take a good hour and a half to play."
3,"Busy busy busy, but not much strategy","I've played Ticket to Ride Europe with my family a few times. The non-gamers in the family find that the rules are hard to remember, while the gamers, like myself, are disappointed by the lack of strategy. It's like a convoluted game of solitaire, where there's a lot going on but not that much interaction."
4,Ticket: Europe Review,"This is game is fun for a couple or a group. The different twists from the previous Ticket game add a new dimension in planning your trip, and the added strategy of the station makes the game more interesting. My only complaint is there are very few long tracks, so you have to nickel and dime your way to a higher score."
4,Excellent game,"I am over 60 and was just introduced to this game a few weeks ago, and I loved it. I bought it immediately and have taught it already to several other people. I bought the European version because that is what I learned on, but I would assume that all the games are equally as enjoyable and educational. For anyone who loves travel by train. I actually bought this for my 30 year old son and decided to keep it for myself! Shame on me. A wonderful addition to anyone's game collection."
4,"Great game, combines a lot of different strategy games into 1!","Game was introduced to us by a neighbor. We loved playing it, so we picked it up. Educational, and combines a number of different game playing strategies. Actually have started playing with our kids (14,12,10). I would recommend for game loving families/couples."
5,Off the hook.,"This Cd is off the hook, Secret Society's ""find your self"" is a slammin 100% pure freestyle track if your a collector or just like freestyle then pick it up."
2,Jeff Gordon # 24 Nascar Barbeque Grill Cover,"Can't see this lasting too long, its VERY thin! Not great quality and too short, it only comes about half way down the grill. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money."
5,Love Amazing Grace,I absolutely love this product. My husband had bought me a gift pack for my birthday last year and I've been purchusing it ever since.
3,Love The Way it Smells,"This conditioner smells great, but can't say much for its conditioning properties. Other, less expensive conditioners, have done as well or better."
3,"It's ok, man","I was looking for a good conditioner that wasn't ludicrously expensive, so Philosophy seemed like a good compromise. It does smell really good (very girlie though), but I don't think it works any better than conditioner you'd buy at a drugstore (like pantene, for example). It's feels very watery and isn't particularly ""silky"" feeling. I probably won't buy it again."
2,Over priced!,I was so disappointed with this product. I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner expecting some kind of improvement...It really is comparable to the $2.00 shampoos and conditioners (like Suave or VO5). I would not ever buy this again.
5,Amazon improves an already great product,"I've used Amazing Grace shampoo and conditioner for a couple years now, and I usually have to go to a local beauty supply store to pick it up. Twice when purchased from the store, the product didn't smell as fabulous as it should once I got it home and opened it. Enter Amazon... Ordered the product, delivered to my door, smells divine. There are people who every time they hug me say ""you smell SO GOOD"". I'd like to believe it is just my natural essence, but I'm pretty sure this conditioner has something to do with it. The scent is not too strong, however. My mother has physical reactions to many perfumes, but this doesn't bother her."
5,Philosophy Amazing Grace Hair Conditioner,I love this product. It makes your hair shiny and silky smooth. Smells wonderful. A little goes along way. Would suggest this product for dry hair. Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Singularly Useless,"It's not a slotted spoon, it's not a spatula. It will become the least-used item in your drawer."
3,Essential for non-stick 'ware,"Some of the Calphalon tools are made in the US, some made in China. Unfortunately this purchase was the latter, much to my disappointment.These utensils consistently perform well, however, and if you want to preserve your nonstick surface, these are essential."
3,meh.,"The shirt is most emphatically NOT made of linen. It is, in fact, made of synthetic material that closely resembles cheesecloth. It's absurdly light, which is a plus under hot stage lights or out on a beach - but also see-through. I wore a tank top under it and it worked out perfectly. Watch the fabric, because it snags very easily. But the laces and ruffles look great."
3,Average shirt,"The price of this shirt is cheap and so is the quality.The sewing is a bit rough with threads still hanging out from the ends of stitchings, especially at the sleeve ends, which I had to trim off.At a distance it looks okay but close up the poor quality of the finished product is really noticeable.As a prop for stage work where the audience are not close up, it would suffice.The collar and frills or gatherings at the front are single layer and sewn with an over-locker and has an unfinished look about it.It would not have been too bad if some edgings were sewn over these edges but I suppose the price would be higher.The material looks cheap and the garment looks as though it was hurriedly sewn.The photo itself actually looks better than the shirt."
3,Cheesy but it does the job,Went to a Prince Tribute and this trusty purple ruffley number actually garnered a compliment. I paid homage to the Purple One. Should you need to emulate Prince or if you like being a psychedelic pirate (and who doesn't?) this somewhat shoddily- put together yet functional number will meet your needs at a reasonable price. Ahoy!
3,Not quite authentic.....,"Recently, I got interested in the Sacred Harp music, being a devoted fan of ""old"" country, western, blues and bluegrass, and bought this CD.I must say I was disappointed because, well, this music is too polished, to perfect, too professional. It is as if a bunch of music majors and professional muscians got together and perfected shape note tunes for the modern ear.I really enjoyed the Sacred Harp Singers at Liberty Church found on the Cold Mountain soundtrack. Granted, it is hard to find this ""authentic"" sound, and harder still for modern urban raised muscians to duplicate that sound. But if you really are looking for traditional, down-home, Sacred Harp music, this isn't the album for you. Yes, it's a brilliant piece of artistic recreation of an old style of singing, but it just doesn't sound true to it's roots, in my opinion."
3,Very Greasy,Not like previous ponds products used before. This one is very greasy and leaves a shine on your skin. However it does keep skin hydrated pretty well.
4,Pump to replace broken pump,"We have a beautiful copper fountain and the pump quit working. This pump was exactly what we needed, came quickly and the price was right."
2,Bad strap,"The watch was fine as I have purchased Rush before and liked the features, but unfortunately I couldn't wear this one because the the strap came loose constantly and I was afraid I would loose it. I would not reccommend this watch to anyone as long as it has this strap."
3,Dry Reading,"Like most books about quality control and quality assurance, this one is a sleeper, too. What is even more interesting is that an author could write a 300-page book about this subject! Dry as it is - and that may be no fault of the author - the book has some valuable ideas about auditing. The chapters are short and well organized, making it easier to find a good ""stop-for-the day point."" I'd suggest putting on a pot of coffee and giving it a shot."
2,Arrows not long enough,This would of been a great toy EXCEPT:Arrows are not long enough to pull back for any kind of shot powerful enough to go anywhere or stick to anything.
3,Bow and arrow,"Great toy, but you may want to check your local stores (Wal-Mart) for this product. By the time I paid shipping charges I could have paid less for a similar one at Wal-Mart."
3,fun but not best quality,"For the price, this is a good start for my 5 year old. It shoots fairly well, however, the arrows are too short and the suction tips need to be glued on better. The tips do not stick to anything but we just shoot through a tire swing.Also, since this is not the best quality fiberglass, running your hand along the bow will get glass fibers in your hands. Gloves should be worn. The black handle is plastic and safer to hold."
1,"Fiberglass splinters, anyone?","Bought one of these for each of my kids. They played with them for a few minutes then lost interest. There are two main problems: 1. the arrows only shoot about 10 feet, and 2. we all ended up with tiny fiberglass splinters in our fingers. These are going in the trash."
2,the arrows are horrible,It is a great bow but horrible arrows. They stick on about every 20th shot ... maybe. The rubber ends for suction are too stiff and do not stick well.
4,Great toy,I bought this for my 8 yrs old grandson. He loves it. It's a good bow for starter. It's been almost two months.
3,Not what you would expect,I can occasionally get the arrows to stick to the wall... if your looking for something that will actually shoot the arrows.... don't buy this. It keeps me entertained though.
1,poor quality but ok for a safe toy,The bow broke within a couple of hours and my daughter gets frustrated that the arrows wont stick to the target but she still enjoys playing with it. It is safe and a good way to see if they are ready for something more sturdy but I wouldn't get it if you had to pay for shipping because you can get an equally poor quality one at walmart.
5,Stop itchy hives,"I've suffered from hives for many years and only just discovered this amazing lotion. It immediately stops the itch so the hives begin to go away. Not everyone likes the smell, but I do, as does my husband, so he never minds applying it to my back. It also moisturizers, which my dry skin loves. If you suffer from itchy skin for whatever reason, you may want to give this product a try."
1,The smell is sickening,"I have never used a product that is so nauseating, the smell permeates the whole house...I threw my SARNA out...which ingredient makes it smell so terrible...can it be left out????"
5,"""He Changed Our World"" Review",Enjoyed the DVD very much and was glad to have it for my collection. Just sorry that we lost such a unique individual. Thanks so much. A+ rating!
5,A REAL HERO NEVER DIES IN OUR HEARTS,I grew up watching steve on discovery he had an incredible ability to get your attention and keep you glued to his every move i still cant believe hes gone i liked tuning in to his show it was always fun and uplifting i think of him now as an inspiration to millions of people all over the world he will never be forgotten.
5,A worthy tribute,"Steve Irwin was one of the greatest people that the world has ever known. This DVD reflects that. Be prepared to cry, no matter who you are."
5,Tribute for the Crocodile Hunter,This DVD is of a very emotional amd moving service for Steve Irwin. We are true fans of his and he was and still is our daughter(s) hero. The DVD is a wonderful tribute to such a remarkable man. The additional footage is also very moving. If you were a fan of the Croc hunter this wonderfully done mermorial to him is a must have.
5,among the best,"No matter what book jaci burton writes you will never be disapointed, she writes a well thought out books plots amazing the romance good too. Read it and read her youll love her books."
3,Very talented but probably needs more impact,"Mai Kuraki has been irresposibly called by the Japanese media to be the runner-up to Hikaru Utada. I don't think they are going in the same direction. The only similarities are their gender and age, though Mai is younger than Hikki.The tune is sounding good, but I guess she'd be better off with more 'teen energy'. It sounds a little too mature for her age.Also, I think she needs more TV exposure here in Japan to win more recognition. The people who are trying to market Mai may be thinking of going in the same path with Hikki, but the strategy definitely needs to be different, as their characteristics of music are."
1,Not worth the money,The second time I used this brush clumps of bristles fell out and it is now completely useless. Try a better (and less expensive) brand.
1,"Bristles fell out first one by one, then all at once","Pastry brushes never seem to last long. I thought that by spending a bit more I would get more use out of this one. At first the bristles fell out one by one, and the second or third time I washed it, the entire head of bristles popped out. If you are looking for a brush that does not lose bristles, I have never found a traditional one that keeps its bristles, but IKEA makes a strange looking pastry brush which has no bristles and therefore cannot lose them, and that's what I have now."
3,Nice material but too large,"I ordered this brush to quickly be able to spread butter on rolls, a cake pan, whatever. I have found it really too large to use effectively in the butter. It does cover quickly, however. All in all, I would say try Wal-Mart or Target or something first."
1,Fell Apart the First Time I Used It,"Used my new brush to apply butter on French bread for making garlic bread. It fell apart on the first use. I should have taken my eight dollars and put it down the drain myself, I would have saved on shipping."
1,Not worth the money,The second time I used this brush clumps of bristles fell out and it is now completely useless. Try a better (and less expensive) band.
1,Poor quality,"Sadly, the company that produces these reproductions seems to be anchored in the analog world while the rest of us have plunged happily into the world of HD sports. I received this DVD and was deeply disappointed in the quality of the image on a HDTV. Why even use a DVD disk for this production - a VHS tape would have been more appropriate! I still have the recorded game on my DVR and compared the production of each. I'm now trying to figure out how I can get the DVR recording on a DVD...Don't buy from these people. It really is a rip-off."
2,NO LIDS INCLUDED,NO LIDS ON THE 2 AND 4 QUART WHICH I BOUGHT ELSEWHERE IN PAST WITH LIDS FOR LESS. 2 QT IS ABOUT $4 MORE THAN 4 QT AND SEEMS OUT OR ORDER. PLAN ON RETURNING ITEMS WHEN I FIND THEM ELSEWHERE AGAIN...DID BUY A SEPARATE LID WHICH IS ALSO TOO MUCH $$$$ AND I WILL BE RETURNING THAT TOO. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE ON AMAZON AS I AM A FREQUENT SHOPPER HERE.
1,Buyer Beware,"I received this product thrown into a box with no packing whatsoever, and without any lids. One of the items is bent and all are scratched and they are of absolutely no use to me without lids. When I contacted ""ReStock It"", they said that the lids can be ordered separately and didn't bother to address the other issues at all. After checking their web site, I see no signs of any separate lids. I would not recommend ReStockIt or anything they sell to anyone. There is a reason their prices are so low!"
3,A hic-up revision,"The refreshing part of the book is that Darwin is postulated to trump the Modern Synthesis by offering a broader and vaguer model. Mostly however, allusions and overinterpretations of re-hashed phenomena and a few recent twists like siRNA, are offered as still-unconvincing examples in a systematic attempt to argue epigenetics as having important biological and evolutionary roles. Yes, some aspects of biology and evolution are somewhat complex, but vague hand waving about epigenetics does not clarify them."
4,Kindle version review,"Buy this wonderful, illuminating work for your e-reader and you will improve it and yourself! You will soon wish that you had all your other great books there as well, available for rereading, scanning and searching at any time. I will not duplicate material in the other, informative reviews, but just want to express surprise that there are not more such works on epigenetic evolution (in all its forms, using ""epi"" in a broad sense).I was doubtful at first about the ""discussions"", expecting quick straw-man knockdowns a la Simplicissimus, but they really add to the exposition. I read it on a Kindle II and only the illustrations suffered, which I figured was OK, as I didn't much care for the style, but on reviewing them on an iPad I found them engaging. Improvements would include links to the notes at the end and return links from there. Some publishers are not fully committed to this e-book thing. Buy the Kindle version for your iPad - it is not (yet?) available as an i-Book."
3,For Pete's sake .....,"... somebody unplug Jeremey Spencer. I want the Green God, I want the Fleetwood/McVie rock-ribbed rhythm section. In micro-doses, I'll take Danny Kirwin. But Spencer's Elvis schtick (and it's Fat Elvis at that) wears thin pretty darn quick. Does anyone actually enjoy it, other than Bowser from Sha-Na-Na? I'd rate this higher with a better track selection."
5,"a great ""live, off the floor"" recording",A great view into this amazing bands powerful musicianship. No wonder bands like the Beatles admired this band and were wondering about their own ability to match them in live performance. A must have for fans of the real Fleetwood Mac
4,Truly Breathtaking,"This man is a god. This is Tom MCrae's debut album, but you cant tell by the musical maturity he puts behind this masterpiece. Lyrics are truly amazing, music is beautiful with cello work at times that blends perfectly on ""You cut her hair"",which is one of my fav's. Hard to put a label or comparison on his music, kinda of a cross between Coldplay, David Gray, and Elliot Smith. The songwriting is some of the best ive heard, standouts would have to be ""Dose me up"",""You cut her hair"",and my favorites ""Language of fools"" and ""Untitled"". ""Untitled"" is a simple song using mainly his voice for impact and a piano in the background,really amazing song. I only gave it four stars just because of maybe one song that wasnt as good as the rest but is still in itself(""draw down the stars"") not bad. Anybody who loves brilliant songwriting and loves getting drawn into the emotional side of the music should buy this work of art."
5,Chillingly beautiful,"Stunning! An album that can't fail to draw you in. Each song is its own and perfectly in place. Tom McRae's streaming vocals are alluring and seductive, they induce a sense of life and wrap around you, whilst piercing you with its sinster, haunting tones.I had only heard 'you cut her hair' and 'draw down the stars' when I bought this album, but was immediately impressed by 'end of the world news', 'bloodless', 'the boy with the bubblegun', and 'Sao paulo rain'.If anyone has found artists of a similar style please let me know! This is an album to be cherished."
4,Acoustic - interestingly mellow!,I heard this album at a friend and its melodies immediately caught my attention.McRae's music has a catchy acoustic feel to it and although coming across as mellow it has an interesting charm to it created by an interplay of instruments and sounds. It is generally laid-back and expressive - a great listen if you're in the mood for somethig easy.
4,Pretty good product,"This is a great product, and a heck of a good price too. The only thing I dislike about this line is the handles - they get HOT, you have to use potholders. The long handles on the other saucepans and such are fine, but the short, stubby handles on this and the stick pot and the lids do get hot. I'd recommend the COMMERCIAL (as opposed to this, the ""professional"") non-stick series, those have handles that do stay cool, but they cost so much more, so it's not really worth it to me. Just remember to use a rag or a potholder, even to pick up the lid. Other than that I have no complaints."
4,"Not too bad, but not as good as some others","I purchased this cooking pan a few months ago, and I think that it is a reasonably good product. I purchased this ""saucier"" because I had purchased an Calphalon Commercial Nonstick Set earlier, but it was missing the one size I needed. Once I saw this at the great price Amazon.com was offering it at, I snapped it up quickly. The construction is quite good, and is made in the United States of America (if you want to show that American pride), and it heats quite evenly. However, the handles get hot very quickly, so you will need potholders to move it. Also, it also seems that the dishes I make with this do not taste as good as the ones I made in my Commercial Nonstick pan. I don't know if it is just something in my mind or if it is really true. But that doesn't really matter considering the excellent price on this. Snatch it up now before they are all gone."
2,Not impressed.,"Had this knife for a couple of weeks and the clip broke. I didn't do anything rough with it, it just snagged on my office chair and snap! The metal used for the handle/clip seems pretty brittle. The handle is actually painted silver and the paint chips away easily. The blade seems ok and holds an edge ok. For this price I wouldn't recommend buying this knife. Go with a leatherman or buck instead(comparable price range)."
4,the slab,"This book started out really good, then got a bit out there toward the end. Still a good, fast paced read."
4,clear but a little simplistic,"This is a nice resource for researchers completely unfamiliar with the process of measure development. The biggest limitation of the book is that it falls short in actually presenting equations for the statistics mentioned. Thus, it is a good place to start if you have little exposure to this process. However, if you plan on actually running a series of studies to create a new measure, then you'll want to augment this book with some real statistics books."
4,Scale Development : Theory and Applications (Applied Social Research Methods),"This book was very helpful, although it does get a bit technical when it comes to the statistical explanations. For non-statisticians, it might be a bit difficult to understand. However, overall it is a good resource to have when designing a health survey."
5,yu~~~ goodssss lor...,"Mmmm...i think never have look like this music ,can give you feel open out, you must try to lisen it Oooo."
3,Not the Best Designed Skimmer,"The Calphalon Nylon Skimmer looks nice in my tall crock filled with the other black nylon Calphalon utensils. However, it is not useful. The holes in this skimmer are too large for collecting froth from the surface of simmering soups, stocks, and stews. Since one never really touches the pan with a skimmer, to me, it does not matter if the skimmer is plastic. I recommend the Calphalon Stainless Steel Mesh Skimmer instead."
3,Sherlock Holmes costume,"The pipe and magnifying glass were fine. The hat was poor quality. The photo showed an adult man wearing the hat, but it was too small for my 10-year-old son."
2,Cheap and worthless!,It broke after about 3 months. I would recommend buying an original from a junk yard; or a dealer if you can afford it.
1,Junk junk junk,Internal plastic gear stripped in less than 4 months. Once I took it apart it was clearly a very cheaply made and fitted part. Avoid these guys like the plague.
2,So so at best,"I bought this item (albeit not through amazon), and it was easy to install, and worked well for about 2 months...and then the plastic gear driven by the motor's worm-gear broke a tooth. Now it works very badly, and I'm getting a replacement. Lots cheaper than the Toyota replacement part ($200???!?!?), but it all depends on what your time's worth. I'll try a different brand next time around."
1,Terrible,"I needed my window fixed to pass inspection. The part worked for that, which is the good part, then about a month later it broke, which is the really bad part. In retrospect, I should have bought a better one for more money to avoid the hassle."
1,Failed after two weeks,This power window regulator is craptastic in every way in what a good power window regulator ought to be. The upper cable broke off from the upper pulley wheel just after two weeks it was installed.
3,R. Smith,"Useful in preventing the odd voice sounds and puffs from such things as the ""P's"" in words. Makes the recordings sound more professional."
5,Wonderful Book for Anyone!,"This book really taught me alot about the human body & what you can do to try & heal yourself naturally. I recommend it to anyone who would like to learn more about themselves, or just to learn some fun info. Wonderfully written, easy to read, a great gift for anyone!! Two thumbs up!!"
4,book,"The book does an excellent job describing, in detail, the different locations on the feet and hands and also the techniques."
4,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reflexology,I received the book in excellent condition. It was a very informative book but I haven't finished reading it yet because I ended up being busier than I thought. I am looking forward to finishing the book when I have more time but I think it is an excellent book.
1,Poorly organized and hard to use,"I recently took a trip to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, and one of the books I took with me was the Insider's Guide. I was disappointed to find that it was the most frustrating guide book that I have ever used. It is so poorly organized! Having the information separated into so many different sections makes it impossible to find anything. For example, I have a son and so I looked at the Kidstuff chapter. It's organized like an alphabet book - which is cute to read but impossible to use. Please re-organize this book - or at least re-do the index. I would like to be able to go to one chapter and find everything in a particular area, not have to read most of the book to find out what's going on in one area.I do think the book is interesting if you have time to sit and read through the whole thing, but I found it very difficult to find things in it."
4,Get the UK version of the reissue,"Get the UK version of the Castle/Sanctuary CD reissue for a normal, low CD price at amazon.co.uk. This is the version to get. Like the first album reissue, it includes a lot of bonus tracks, 11 total for 23 songs, way better than the American version which only has 16. And these bonus tracks are amazing, particularly ""A Well Respected Man"" and ""See My Friends"". As far as the original album goes Kinda Kinks is a strong improvement over the first album. Ray Davies (and to some extent Dave) have switched from their attempt at being white, blues guys and instead have gone straight toward pop rock. This album features so many great songs including ""Tired of Waiting for You"", ""So Long"", ""Come On Now"" and the beautiful ballad ""Something Better Beginning."" Again, if you're into rock and pop you need this! Basically, with the bonus tracks, it's like buying two great Kinks albums on one CD so what are you waiting for?"
1,"Nope, Nope, NOPE!!!",Don't even bother with this one.All of these songs are remakes done in the 1990's!!! And Merle sure didn't sound anything like he did in 1970 when he remade these songs.Don't waste your money here. Just give it to some bum on the street and you will feel better than if you spent it on this.
5,Merle Haggard 24 Greatest Hits,This Is Merle At His Best I Just Got This Cd In The Mail Today And Let Me Tell You It's The Best Merle Haggard Album Ever Made So What If They are Remakes I Think They Are Great Songs So Many Hits In One Album Like Rambin' Fever Branded Man Sing Me Back Home And Many More Hits Songs You Can Sing a Long To So Catchy So If You Are a Fan Of Merle Haggard Pick This One Up Today I Got Mine Very Cheap Here At Amazon.com and I Think 5 Dollars Or So For 24 Hits Is a Fair Price The Best Song on Here Is Old Man from the Mountain But Anway Pick This Up Today.
1,Complete Waste of Time,"This is a tale of bored people with no ethics, morals or hope.Heavy on blood and violence, very light on storyline or characters.Gah, don't waste your time."
4,not sure it actually does any good...,"Oh this definitely gets the grime out of your nose--just be sure to let it really, really dry up good (the strip should crack when you peel it off). But you know, the dirt is going to go right back into those freshly opened pores, and then you'll be dependent on this product for as long as you care to be... it is fun to see all the oil come up though. It's on my wishlst, but only for special occasions. I wouldn't use it regularly. I wonder if it damages your pores..."
4,WORKS WELL,My Wife and I both used the Pond's Clear Pore Strips. TheY work well but not as well as Biore brand strips. They leave your nose clean and smooth and you can really feel the difference. You can also use these strips on other areas of your face as well.
4,Impressive Modern Oratorio,"I've never been much impressed by Adams before, but I may have to rethink my viewpoint. This is a great opera (or oratorio) that treads the same ground as the first half of Handel's 'Messiah'. I particularly liked the use of various non-Bible texts in different languages, and some of the Britten-like orchestration. With Lorraine and Dawn singing, it's also faultlessly performed. Definitely recommended, whatever your tastes in classical music."
5,Great resource for the CWNA exam,I am currently studying for the CWNA exam and I have no other resources. This book helps you understand the concepts in plain language. I started using it with the SQ3R method and I find that I can really retain the concepts offered in this book. The SQ3R method takes a little time but if you really want to learn it for the test combine it with how the information is laid out in this book and you'll get it. Good luck!
5,neat tote bag,This is a great tote bag and very functional. Well made and true to size. Can be worn from daytime to night time. Roomy yet stylish... wish there is a matching cosmetic bag or hat to match this product.
5,A suprising discovery,"I took notice of Ms. Charlton's music years ago, when she was still a student at Cornell accumulating national prizes and magazine articles for her original music, not to mention her skill as an engineer. I weas lucky enough to see an article about her (in another state, I might add), followed up on some of the press, and bought a copy of this CD, which very quickly went on heavy rotation on my stereo. This woman is clearly a gifted pianist, but instead of applying her talent into the classical or jazz concert scene, she seems to have poured it into her own inventive and evocative compositions. They are quite original--sometimes as complex as the mathematics that inspired them, sometimes as resonant and melodic as love itself. Liz Story and George Winston get credit in the liner notes, and it's clear that their influence on her was more than superficial. If there's more where this came from, then before too long she'll be mentioned in THEIR liner notes too."
2,My best friend owned this mask,So my best friend got this mask for halloween.I myself got a normal one.It got the job done.[note we were like 6-9]But about a couple of months later it broke!He was very unhappy with this product and we even got it in stores.And no we didnt play with it since we were only 6-9.Point is it will work for halloween dont expect it to last long after tho unless you get lucky.RATEING 2/5 not that great get a normal mask its better looking anyways.We ended up throwing this mask away case it broke very easy.
5,awsome,"this mask is soooooo good, i have recently bought and it is perfect, its also terrifying so you could scare your friends with it all the time"
4,Recommended,"A thoroughly entertaining biography of Bruce McLaren, who comes through as an all round nice bloke. Such a pity he was taken from us so early in his life."
5,Great selection,"Lots of songs, lots of stuff from bands I wouldn't want to spend money buying a while book of theirs -- the ""one hit wonders"". A good purchase. Only thing that is somewhat of a problem is that, having so many songs, the book is thick, even using the very thin phone book type paper, and therefore can not be put in my music stand. I also own volumes 1 and 2 of the guitar collection, and the bass guitar one, and they are all great."
2,"Lots of ""stuff""","I guess this book is OK... I would not be buying any of the other ones.When your bored, you'll buy anything. duh"
4,Calphalon 10 inch Stir-fry pan,This pan is great for 2-3 servings. The ability to cook your Asian recipes in a short time with even cooking temp. The non-stick coating allows you to use little to no oils and keep the fat content to a minimum. I think the Calphalon line is a great investment for any serious cook's kitchen.
4,The Passionate Gourmet,"I often need to make a quick dish .........hopefully healthy. Between this and my Zojurshi Rice Cooker stir frys are the perfect answer. I debated long and hard before I committed to buy this pan because I new how often I would use it. Great pan great price and would have gotten five stars except I believe as a pan gets heavier and larger the handle should get wider for easier handling and control. Small point however, because I have compensated by making sure my thumb is on top of the handle and not wrapped around it. Heats perfectly and clean up is a breeze as well."
5,Calphalon is a great product!!!,I need to replace all my pots and pans! I bought this for sauce making and love the clear glass lid!
5,"The best treatment of the ""6 days"" debate available!","I found this book to be the best scholarly treatment of the 6-days debate available today. Literal and non-literal views are presented fairly. This second edition is beautifully produced and makes several improvements over the first edition. It's profoundly theological but quite easy to read. If you are trying to make up your mind on this issue, I recommend that you own this book. Every seminary and chuch library should have a copy."
1,Anything Ken Ham thinks is a good antievolution book is clearly bunk...,It's really time for the creationist throwbacks to join reality and stop trying to hock their pseudo-science. Creationism is DEAD. Evolution is reality.Enough is enough.
5,Awesome,"Kreuter's photography really captures the diversity, creativity and 'out of the box' off the wall craziness of Burning Man. The CD is first class too."
5,incredibly powerful and eloquent book,"This is the second of a four volume set. I'm on the last one. They are all incredibly good. Perhaps the best books I've read in my life, and I've read roughly 25 books on Buddhism, Christianity, new age scientific, and spiritual subjects over the last 3-4 years. I've never read a four volume set of anything in my life.In general each of her books is better than the previous, presumably because she is becoming a better ""channel."" This second book is notably better written than the first, but I wouldn't skip the first.Its a very improbable story, her story. Regardless of whether you believe it, the eloquence of the prose and the spiritual message are incredibly powerful. To make a point, not intending to denigrate Patricia's previous proffession in any way, I will say, ""you will eventually come to realize that it would be impossible for a medical transcriptionist in Boise to write these books."""
3,A different kind of berry....,"I am a big fan of Navitas Naturals and purchase a lot of their products. However, I don't really care for these goldenberries. Maybe it's the tangy flavor... Maybe it's the unusual texture... I don't know. I'm glad I gave them a try, but I'll definitely be sticking to goji berries."
5,surprisingly good!,"Amazingly addictive healthy snack food! Also good with chocolate, so how can you go wrong?"
5,Gooseberries!,"I like gooseberries but was curious how that would translate to a dried product. Guess what? Dried gooseberries taste like regular gooseberries. It's mostly just a texture difference, but these dried Navitas ""Goldenberries"" are nice and moist and otherwise exactly like the fresh version. If you've never had gooseberries, they're a bit sour with a hint of sweet and have tiny seeds inside that are fun to chew on if you're at all interested in that sort of thing."
2,a bit bitter,"These berries are not sweet at all and take a bit getting used to. My family members do not like them but you don't have to worry about overeating them! I haven't tried baking with them yet, but it might help to put them with a sweetened cookie dough."
2,Not your ordinary snacks.....,"The taste is bitter, like some reviewers mentioned. It also has a pungent taste after the bitterness subsides. Very sour. Somehow it also tastes a little spicy, which was odd. We can't eat it just like any other snacks. Probably best as cooking ingredient or for making smoothies. As one reviewer pointed out, these don't look particularly fresh to us once we opened the bag. But then the expiry date is like one year away."
1,Will Never Order These Again,"Bought this product based on claims by seller, as well as all the positive reviews. I was very disappointed in this product.Expensive. Wasn't sweet at all, very, very chewy, and the tartness was not pleasant. Will get my vitamin C from American Health Ester C w/Citrus Bioflavanoids."
2,Good for the rare pieces.....but...,"Overall, you will be hard up to find a more thoroughly complete two hand piano survey of Schumann's piano opus. However, for the more ""popular"" pieces such as the op 17, or the kinderszenen, these are decent to mediocre versions are best. They arent bad, Jorg Demus is a skilled pianist, though has always in my view been more successful in a supporting role, as evidenced by his masterful accompaniment in Dichterliebe and assorted Schubert lieder. If you are familiar with Richter's masterful Schumann interpretations-or Horowitz for many of the works, or Lupu, Argerich, these pale in comparison. If you are out for quantity-I would recommend the Ashkenazy set-though it is incomplete. Again, many of the works by schumann that you can only find here will only be of interest to the absolute Schumannaholic, which I am, but it is kind of a two way street because if you are a schumann madman, then you will know how third tier these performances truly are."
3,Swamp Gas,"Until it comes out on DVD, this VHS artifact is a collector's item that any fan of The Firesign Theatre should have next to their copy of The Case of the Missing Yokes. Sure, it's only a lipsync visualization of the album Everything You Know Is Wrong (one of their best), but it gives you a chance to see how creative the team can be with a small budget."
3,I always loved these guys ...,"... but in this case, they're a LOT better in audio only. I recommend any and all of their CDs (""albums"" to us older folks) because the visuals are better."
1,Chocolate syrup,"The product has changed, dramatically since I last purchased some about 4 months ago. It even tastes worse!! They've added High Fructose Corn Syrup and cheapened the taste. It now tastes just like their regular syrup found in all supermarkets. Even my friend said the same thing. It's no longer ""special"" and I won't be purchasing it anymore, a shame, it used to be very good!"
3,expensive!,"Well, I walked in from Walmart five minutes ago, after buying a bottle of this for $1.68. Why is this so expensive? Same size, same label... FYI, shoppers."
4,Not available in can anymore :(,This is my absolute favorite but since going to the plastic bottle packaging the flavor and taste has deteriorated. BRING BACK THE CAN!!!I purchased 2 cases 3 years agao from Safeway in the DC/VA/MD area but now......HELP!!...anyone seen this in the can and where can I get it???
1,I never received the shipment,"I never received either the shipment nir an explanation from Amazon. I ultimately received a refund. A disappointing experience, not what I have experienced before. Is Amazon no longer a good source of groceries?"
5,Excellent,Excellent text for engineers seeking to interface their projects with the PC. I waited for a long time for a text like this to emerge. It contains all the practical stuff you won't see in generic computer science texts. Highly reccommended.
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Based on the earlier reviews, I though this is a good book to read. But I was wrong. I think all earlier reviewers (other than one review that rated it one star) probably do not know how to use help in Visual Basic. If you want to use PCs for monitoring project, just read VB help for comm port control. This book is full of examples and not much explaination about understanding of serial communication. I totally agree with review of December 9, 1999 that any one who has any knowledge of VB should not buy this. Reading this book was a total waste of time and money."
4,I regularly use a few Oil of Olay ...,I regularly use a few Oil of Olay products and am happy with all those. This was no exception. The Oil of Olay UV Protectant Beauty Fluid is a very good sunscreen plus moisturizer all in one bottle. I think it works really well on normal skin. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends. My sister didn't like this product too much as she found the smell too strong. That might be just one drawback. It's a very good product otherwise. I would definitely recommend it!
3,"As a daily moisturizer, this product doesn't compare ...","As a daily moisturizer, this product doesn't compare to my usual moisturizer, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. The Oil of Olay left my face feeling tight, even after applying a liberal amount. I might, however, use this product in the summertime when I want sun protection and am not wearing any other makeup. It does moisturize better than a regular sunscreen."
4,I was happy with this product although it ...,"I was happy with this product although it didn't seem to provide moisture all day. My skin is dry and I was hoping that this product would meet my needs. It was a very creamy, nice fragrance in an easy-to-use bottle."
5,One of the few I will buy,"When I buy moisturizer the single most important factor is the SPF, and I also consider the price. This is a good moisturizer that not only has the proper ingredients to provide great sun protection, but is also reasonably priced and lasts a long time. I will buy another brand if it has the right ingredients and is cheaper, but this brand is available at most stores and I know I can trust it."
5,Doesn't leave your skin feeling oily...,"This is the only brand and type of lotion I've used that doesn't leave your skin feeling really oily. It feels like nothing is on there at all. Sure, if you have extremely dry skin, you might want something more oily. But for the average person, I'd highly recommend this product."
5,"shimmering, brilliant pop","this cd is flawless every track is perfectly written and executed the two bonus tracks are tracks which were previously available with the vinyll copy of the l.p. which is now out of print and are as good as any other track on the the U.S. version of the album. the german version also comes with an extra track so you should pick up a copy of that as well. if you enjoy great pop like the beach boys, style council, everything but the girl then you should deffinately check out this band."
4,GREAT,"This is really good Todd Runngren influanced, paino-based pop. Nice, wistful singing and lots of interesting chord changes. These are thoughtful love songs, and the vocalist is very expressive. The backing band is also great. Singer-songwritter stuff that could be from 1971. A must buy."
5,Great,This is a great sub. I have one that i recently bought but im planning on getting a second. Its has a very good bass it response that about it and all i can say is that this thing hits hard. I say its the best sub for the price
5,"Very good, intense book based on even better TV series.","This book is written extremely well throughout. It is the kind of short book that you feel you want to and should just read all through, from front to back. I almost did (if it wasn't for starting it late at night!) It is almost exactly as the episode on TV portrayed it, which is also a good point. Well worth a read even if you're not an x-phile, if you are, then it's a must-read book."
5,"An Appalachian Spring, Courtesy of Two Canadians","Listen to their ascending harmonies at the end of the southern folk classic ""Old Blue"" and you'll hear two parallel lines of even tone that perfectly express the paradox of loss: the simultaneous joy and sorrow inside the aching arc of remembering an animal companion.They sing folk songs they way they were meant to be sung: purely, but without affecting a ""traditional"" (whatever the hell that was, or is) stance and without pandering to then-contemporary musical tastes.From old-time music to gospel, French-Canadian chanson, work songs, cowboy laments and more, their readings of these tunes have stood the test of time."
5,Brings Back Memories Of Their Golden Era,"I confess to being one of those entranced by the edgy harmonies of this Canadian folk duo. Back in the day, their albums were regular purchases, until the ""rock"" started to outweigh the ""folk."" This collection covers what was, to me, the golden era of Ian and Sylvia ... and it was a pleasure to be able to replace the worn-out vinyl."
5,More Please,"This is my little one's ""blankie"" - i wish I could find more; we've gone through 3 of them and the last one is full of holes. I need to find this exact blanket again, but in Yellow!!!"
5,Quality,"Nice and useable blanket, goes everywhere and works when hot or cold to keep baby perfectly comfy."
5,Fantastic under the radar album,"Been listening to this record for awhile and while it may be easy to call it retro psycho blues rock on initial listenings(not a bad thing by the way)it is much more accomplished than that.The liner notes say it was recorded 16 track onto one inch tape and it sounds tremendous,close attention reveals real depth and richness with marvelous instrumentation and arrangements.Unfair really to label it retro because it doesn't sound like anything that has gone before but it certainly evokes a different musical era than the one we currently find ourselves in."
5,Most original album in years,"Somewhere between psychedelic rock, delta blues and old-timey folk lies the Entrance Band. Mr. Entrance has managed to do something virtually unheard of for a musician - come up with something totally, unbelievably original. The music can barely be described. Three beyond talented musicians mix elements of classic genres and throw in a little bit of what makes them young, strong, and cool.Prayer of Death is ridiculous. It is captivating, inspiring, and touching. You can't understand until you listen to it . . . so do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ALBUM!"
3,Shouldn't have bought the entire cd.,"Grim Reaper Blues and Prayer of Death are awesome songs, but the rest of the album is just o.k., while two of the songs sounded unfinished to my ears. I know it's Indie and all, but it could use a little spit shine."
5,Excellent insight!,"The monk Mark Gruber takes you to a trip into themonastic life that is unknown to many including to manymonks in the West. He experiences the life of monks as it wasestablish by St Anthony (251-356 A.D.) in the Desert of Egypt...a countrythat accepted Christianity @ the hands of St Mark, a country thatoffered and is still offering martyrs to the Church."
5,Captivating description of our monks,"I just finished this book and absolutely loved it. It thrills me to see someone who is not Coptic, slowly develop a deep since of your mindset and feelings. The monks must have truly accepted the author to share so much with him and in turn, the author poetically describes everything to the reader.For anyone that is curious about us (the Copts) and our religion, this book is a wonderful introduction. It capture a very true sense of who we are, what we believe, and how we worship God. I can't thank the author enough for bringing to light, this hidden treasures of my culture."
2,When I was a Kid and What I read as a kid !,I read a Children 's Book called Peter Rabbit and the record read along in My room playing the record constantly til I get borned ! This helped me with my reading and listening skills that I needed for life as a child !
1,Don't buy this book,"The book is full of errors. The quotations are misrepresented, the commanders are put in the wrong era (of the 6 Americans listed as fighting in the American War of Independence, only 1 actually did so; 4 of the others fought in the American Civil War, a hundred years later), other writings, such as Clausewitz' ""On War"" are denigrated. It's not an accurate, well thought out book, even for the young reader to which it is marketed."
1,It dosen't even deserve 1 star,"It was 5 bucks that could have gone to a better place, Half baked theories - myths believed to be fact and horrible obvious inaccuracies that are a definite embarresment to this author. If he was expecting praise his expectations were to high. Don't waste your time, it contains some websites and is mainly for teeny boppers who are obsessed with a movie and don't really care whats fact or fiction as long as they know Leonardo DiCaprios' name is in it somewhere"
3,Pretty Good,"I don't share everyone else's bad reviews as I thought the book was interesting. I have read many, many books about the Titanic, including Charles Pellegrino's books about the exploration of the wreckage on the Ballard expeditions. Although I do not pretend to be a Titanic historian, and several are a lot more qualified than I am to say whether Shapiro's facts are correct or not, I still found it an interesting read."
5,A Great Book,I think the book Total Titanic was a very well written book. This book was the best Titaic book I have read to this Day. I reccomend this book for readers of any age.
1,NOT MINOLTA,CHEAP IMITATION! This is a deceitful listing. The real Minolta battery has 1500mah and lasts much longer.
2,Fell Apart,"The linen fabric of the shirt is extra thin, so much so that it is easily pulled apart. The seams, therefore, didn't have anything substantial to be sewn into; the shirt basically falls apart when you pull it on. Very disappointed to see how very, very shoddy this shirt was. Never written complaint; wanted to save someone else the trouble ..."
3,Adequate for Halloween,"The pirate shirt was adequate for a Halloween costume. As some of the other reviews mentioned, it is a little thin. However, it was sized large enough (44) so that I was able to wear a sweatshirt under it."
2,Incredibly SMALL,"I ordered 2 of these, size XL--which they said fits up to a 46"" chest. I couldn't believe how small they actually were. I ordered them for two bigger guys, and they couldn't even get their arms into them. I tried them on a girl with a 36"" chest just to see the sizing, and it was almost tight on her. THESE ARE IN NO WAY XL!!!"
3,"Bought it for class, never used it",The professor decided not to use this book after I had already ordered it. I had to cover the cover of the book with a note card. The picture very much grosses me out.
4,Brakes On A Runaway Discourse,"A profoundly important book, scholarly and engaging. Relentless in its formation, the central insight that environmental activsm reveals itself as largely aesthetic in character ultimately arrives with a thunderous and disheartening thud."
2,No thanks,"I get why this book is popular and many people recommend it but it wasn't for us. Our baby has a milk-protein allergy and acid-reflux so putting him on a schedule is nearly impossible. We keep him on a loose schedule and that works for us and he started sleeping through the night around 10-11 weeks old (which is pretty good for a baby with acid-reflux).The Baby Wise people seem a little too strict and nutty for my taste, but I do think a loose schedule is pretty beneficial. I don't know how babies can be kept on a strict schedule as they are, um, babies and not soldiers."
1,Zero Stars,"The American Academy of Pediatrics and many QUALIFIED baby experts consider this a dangerous book. For more information, read the articles and reports here: http://www.ezzo.info/babywise.htm"
1,Horrible book,"This book is borderline child abuse. With all of the child abuse and neglect out there, this book is a thumbs down. Instead of encouraging nurturing and loving your sweet innocent baby, he encourages neglect. One day people will realize that letting their baby ""cry it out makes as much sense as washing their mouths out with soap, and hitting them with a stick or belt."
1,BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS BEWARE!!!!!!!,"I am breastfeeding, and let me tell you, this book DOES NOT make sense for nursing mothers. If you do your research according to MANY reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics, feeding your baby according to a rigorous schedule is NOT RECOMMENDED. In fact, according to a study, mothers can have a difference in their STORAGE CAPACITY in their milk ducts up to 300%!!! In other words, some mothers can produce 32 oz. of milk while nursing seven times a day, and other mothers may need to nurse up to twelve times to produce the same amount. All babies are different - this book assumes that all babies will happily nurse every three hours without complaint. I DO NOT recommend this book to ANYONE - it does not encourage common sense or listening to your own instincts as a mother. PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Beware of this book on Child Abuse,"I would rate this zero stars.http://www.ezzo.info/(The site is about Babywise and Gary Ezzo, theauthor.) Very few people know that this book is verydangerous and that it promotes child abuse & neglectand has caused thousands of infants to develop FailureTo Thrive syndrome. The American Academy ofPediatrics has a warning out against the book, (asdoes the Child Abuse Prevention Council of OrangeCounty, which did an extensive review of the book).Many, many people are still using this book, withoutrealizing the harm they are doing to their children.What's worse, many people are reading the OLD version,which contains 35 bits of falsified medicalinformation. Since Gary Ezzo was exposed for beingcrazy, his publisher broke their contract and he isnow self-publishing a slightly less horrible version.(However, it is still horrible!)I had a couple of friends who were using the book andthey were VERY grateful to me for letting them knowabout this website."
1,On Becoming Baby-Stupid,"Not recommended for high need babies and infants less than 6 mos. old. When did we become so wrapped up with what we want before our babies' needs? Sure we're sleep deprived in the first few months but babies are babies. They do cry because they NEED us. Babies eventually learn to sleep on their own. Give it time and everything will fall right into place.As always when we're desperate we keep on looking for a *quick* solution.IF YOU'RE BREASTFEEDING, this is not one of them!Give it time, in the looong run, the rewards for being more patient is priceless..."
1,This book scared me,I ddiin;t realize that to be a succesful parent I had to have such a negative attitude toward my children untill i read this book.Thank goodness Mr.Ezzo woke me up to what bothersome little creatures they are and how it is my duty to get them to snap to and behave straight from the womb.Seriously - I can;t belive this book is still in print. thankgoodness I had my mom to calm me down and point out that all this idiot did was write a book. My own parenting instincts were lightyears ahead of this books dangerous blabberings.
1,On Becoming Baby Wise,I am ashamed to own this book. Mr. Ezzo does not take in consideration the needs of a baby. Babies have growth spurts and need to feed when they are hungery. It is neglectful to follow Mr. Ezzo's guidelines for feeding a baby under six months of age. Babies learn to trust their parents when parents respond to baby's cries and needs. Babies cannot tell time and will not learn to trust a parent who puts a baby on a schedule disregarding the baby's needs.
5,It worked for us.,"I wish we had received this book before our daughter was born. We fought the sleep/eating thing for quite a while. After hearing about this book from a friend that had tryed it, we gave it a shot. Man what a difference. It was tough to stick to it the first few nights. But looking back, it was much less stressful than the nights of endless attempts to stop the crying. It didn't take but a few nights to start to see improvement. After 7-10 days, she was sleeping through the night."
1,Dangerous and heartless advice,"Strictly concontrolled schedules; recommendation to use physical punishment for toddlers; and no research to support their methods. The author has no professional background in child development or medicine, although he implies that he does. The infant-feeding advice is inconsistent with standard medical recommendations, including that of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and when followed for newborns can be downright life-threatening. There are plenty of baby books out there, this is not one I would recommend."
1,"A non-intuitive, non-child friendly device","This is truly a dreadful book. Why is there such concern onhaving babies sleep through the night and forcing them into schedules?I don't want my children to sleep for any set period until *they* are ready. I love nursing at night- it keeps my period away. The feeding schedule is detrimental to milk supply, and the rigid rules are detrimental to the confidence of almost all loving, attachment parents. The scriptural basis upon which the original ""theories' were established are flawed, weak and do not stand up to scrutiny when trying to view them in any historical/biblical basis. Buy ""Christian Parenting"" by Wm and Martha Sears if you wish to find an empathetic, loving way of raising your children. The Ezzos know nothing about Raising Kids Gods Way, but they like to spout off about raising kids coldly, and the Ezzo way."
4,Good guidelines for new parents - rely on your own judgement,"I read this book when my daughter was 2 weeks old and immediately began implementing the basic guidelines of the book. By the time she was 6 weeks old she was on a flexible schedule and only woke once through the night. To me this was great considering the horror stories I had heard from parents of 3 year olds who still weren't sleeping through the night and who basically ran the house. My daughter is now 10 months old and has been sleeping 10-12 hours uninterrupted 98% of the time since she was 3 months old. Just like me, she has a bad night every now and again. My daughter is a happy, cheerful baby, she goes to sleep pretty easily, and when I wake her up she is in a good mood. I personally do not follow anybody's advice to the letter and I wouldn't advise that with this book; although there are some good basic guidelines."
1,This book leads to child abuse,"BEWARE!! Be very scared of this book and the material inside of it. I did practice this style of parenting and now look back and feel ashamed that I listened to someone who has no medical backround, someone who is a self proclaimed expert. This book leads to child abuse and child neglect. It goes against best medical practices from the American Acadmey of Pediatrics, World Health Organization and La Leche League. Please for the sake of our chuldren do not use this book. You are more of an expert on your child than Mr. Gary Ezzo ever will be. Listen to your heart!"
1,The worst advice I've received,This book was given to me when my first child was little after hearing him cry and taking the advice of the book I decided it was nonsense to wait and wait until he fell asleep. Babies cry because they need something. I gave this book back and still feel ashamed I tried this wacko method.
1,Ineffective and Manipulative,"The advice in this book did not work for my baby. The schedule they suggest has helpful ideas, but I felt uncomfortable enforcing these ""rules"" on my baby, especially when she didn't respond well to them. Several mothers I have spoken with agree that the language in this book is ridiculously manipulative, making it seem as though only bad and selfish parents don't follow his advice. Also, the author, Ezzo, didn't even graduate with a 4 year degree - in anything! He is incredibly underqualified to be giving such advice to parents. Even the American Academy of Pediatrics have said that following this book's approach can be dangerous to your child. The best sleep book I've read is ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" by Weissbluth. Weissbluth is a Chicago Pediatrician who specializes in infant sleep."
