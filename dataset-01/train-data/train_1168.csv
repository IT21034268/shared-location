4,Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift,Moves at a good pace. Too slow in some spots. Cars are stars...drivers in 2nd place. My personal fav = Brian Tee. He makes the that metal machine look almost as good as him! He's the reason I invested my $$ in this DVD!!!
4,fast and the furious tokyo drift,"Imagine sliding around curves up to more than ninety to one hundred miles per hour. This movie contains reckless driving and illegal behavior involving teens, and some sexual content. This movie stars Lucas black, trula Marcus mostly every part of this movie there is some type of street racing or drifting. ""DON'T DO THIS ON THE MAIN ROAD"" unless you want to get pulled over, end up dead, or rotting in prison for the rest of your life. This movie has highly trained professionals and is not to be preformed by anyone at any time or place. Also this movie leaves you hanging at the end.It is adrenaline pumping explosive action and if I were you I would rent this movie but if you don't like action and racing movies than I would avoid this movie big time. Trust me you will not be Disappointed. So get off the couch and go rent this movie this movie will probably be at blockbuster and any other videogame, movie rental store.Movie America 2006 movie America 2006"
3,Fun...guilty pleasure,"Even though I am well above the age that should like movies such as this...I couldn't help but be entertained.It doesn't get any shallower than this movie....the first FATF movie was about young 20 somethings trying to find their place in the world...Tokyo drift takes us back to the highschool days (but uses 20 something actors)both in America and Japan....exaggerated and stereotyped versions of both.The plot and acting doesn't even meet the standards of a Disney teen flick..but if you love cars, (particularly Japanese imports) street races and chases...then Tokyo Drift is for you. It is beautifully filmed...and looks spectacular in HD. This movie is all about over saturated colors, pumping music and screaming engines/screeching tires. Just toss a bag of popcorn in the microwave, shift your brain into neutral (no thinking required) and have a good time with this movie."
4,great third!,The Movie was great considering it didnt have Paul Walker in it!I loved the end with an old member watch it yourself!!!!!!
1,Meaningless and do more harm than good,"I watched this DVD just because I have watched Initial D (the same car racing / drifting gerne) animation. I watched it just because I wanted to know how it could be shot with real people. To my disappointment, I found it was a very useless theme. There is no actual reason for this drifting/racing. I guess that is a teenage thing -- anger. I believe a lot of 1-star had been giving to this film and I am not going to eleborate any more.I found it has a real bad influence to anyone who loves cars and those who always wanted to race. Even though the main character, Sean, never really injured in the movie, all his opponents died! Right, they all died. If anyone has a clear mind, Sean is just on the border and he could be the next one in line.Last 2 words -- Drive Safely."
3,All I've got is time,"Hi!This is a fun movie, especially if you hate rich people. All the rich people in this movie get what they deserve. Because they're rich. Did I mention how much I hate rich people? If you hate rich people, watch this movie. Did I mention it was made by rich people? I hate them, too. Except that guy who hates rich people in the movie previews like me who tells me not to copy movies because it keeps him from being rich. This movie has lots of fast cars, and rich people getting what's coming to them, isn't that right, Spank?"
2,it was okay,"I love the franchise, but this one is NOT one of my favorites. I suppose it takes more than just the one time to have it grow on you."
4,movie,My item got to me fast with no problems and the disk works just like the information explains on the site.
5,Favorite F&F Title,"This movie is of great quality and if you are into cars you will appreciate it. Even people who look at this film as being too ""ricey"" will like the twist that comes in at the end. The stunt doubles do really great jobs in this film. Keiichi Tsuchiya (the real Drift King) is even in this film as a fisherman. He also does some of the stunt drifting and you can access a small portion from the special features menu. Great movie and definately worth the price! I actually saw it twice before I bought it."
5,The Greatest Movie of the Millenium!!,"Are you tired of movie with great ideals but are boring?This movie is low on plot but high on VVRROOOMMM!!!!*DVD WARNING: The Bonus Features on my disk plays the same ""Drifting School"" feature overe and over. Its a technical glitch that has to be addressed by the dvd pressers.Knock it all you want. This movie has the most satisfying final scene of a movie that I've see in years.You watch movies to be entertained, right? Sit back and ENJOY."
5,Depends on what your looking for,"In my opinion this movie is great. It focuses on the cars often and, for once, is realistic. The drifting scenes were done by professional D1 Grand Prix Drifters (D1 is the ""tournament"" or ""league"". Rhys Millen, Tanner Foust, etc. all contributed. I did not experience the ""Drifting School"" repeat that I knowticed another user mentioned.If you are looking for a bulletproof script with car chases thrown in, don't watch this. It does have flaws in the plot.if you want a nice mix of cars and plot this is a great movie for you.(This is all from a person who loves cars and modifying them)Sacrilege does occur at the end of the movie.SPOILER:Mustang + RB26DETT = Sacrilege"
3,dissapointed in the new actor...,i dont love the face that the plot revolves around high school students...
3,"better than part 2, and roller ball I thought",yest its probably leading further and further away from waht it started out as but i still liked it more than part 2 and way more than that roller ball movie no movie of the year but ketp my attention
1,Slow Drift,"I tried to give this movie a chance seeing as how I love to speed, love cars, and love to see folks stunt in cars. (Don't believe the hype about only men loving their cars; I'm just about obsessed with my own.) I went to see this movie for the simple fact that I figured there was no way I could not like this movie. Bow Wow is a pretty charismatic dude and I was hoping he pulled this movie off like he did in ""Roll Bounce."" Fat chance. All of the actors in this one seemed to be out of place, and even the stunts didn't amuse me much. The plot was too shifty, and it moved too slowly for me to even want to pay attention. I couldn't get into this one, which was even more surprising because I liked the other two. But if there is a fourth one, I can guarantee you that I'll STILL be front and center."
4,Its Fast and Furious!,Terrible format. Go buy this movie on Bluray. Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.
4,"3 Fast, 3 Furious","After buying the original ""The Fast and The Furious"" I found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it. However, I can now say I am a fan of the trilogy (all 3 films are good).Lucas Black is simply The Man and gives another great performance here. Bow Wow does a surprisingly good job as well. Car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie (which I am neither). This is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy."
4,I'd watch it again....,"I thought this movie was exactly what it was supposed to be. There was no big name actors, but there was also no bad acting. Everything was perfect. The cars were absolutely sick and the scenes with them were amazing. If you like cars and you like speed, there is no way you can miss this movie. I am not going to say it is better then the 1st or 2nd Fast and the Furious, but I am not in any way going to say it is worse. Watch the movie, you'll like it."
4,Underrated Chapter in the Series,"This chapter in the Fast & Furious series is often considered the least favorite as main stars Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were pretty much absent aside from a last minute cameo. I have come back to this film a few times for my memories of the very exciting race through the housing development and ended up staying for the balance of the picture. Taken for what it is, the film is very enjoyable with good cars and action. My heart still belongs to the old Detroit muscle cars, so I love a few of the other entries in the series, but still found this one enjoyable enough to add to my collection. Recommended to fans of this genre, regardless of interest in the Vin Diesel F&F films."
3,Fast and Furious Tokoyo Drift,This movie okay. I think it is the worst of the Fast and Furious series. I had never seen it before. None of the original people were in this film until the very end.
4,what is it?????????,there's a song that is in the first race. it's part rap and part rock. can anyone tell me what it's called? please help!!!!!!
3,What the heck?,"Ok I have a question, why does this series keep straying farther away from what the underground scene is really about? People dont drift on the streets they do it professionally on real race tracks. Part 1 was horribly put together but it at least got the main point across. I of course will see this movie and probly enjoy it but I wish they would stick to drag racing since thats pretty much what people do in real life. Peace"
3,Not bad,This 3rd installment of the fast and furious was cool it was better than I thought but it just wasn't enough racing in this one there was a lot of action I like this one you just got to accept the fact that the stars from the 1st 2 are not in this one but its good you should go see this.
4,A-Typical New Mexico literature,"It's part Wild at Heart, part Feast of Snakes, but somehow wholly original. Both thrilling and hillarious, Typical Pigs takes an unflinching gaze at the laws the govern our behavior, then complicates matters by throwing in several emotional anarchists. Its portrayal of the mentally challenged is at once honest and brutal, and unlike anything I've read before."
5,Using it every day,I love this journal. It is my companion every day at the gym! Perfect!!I would be buying more of it when I am done with this one.
2,Too small,Actually ended up throwing this journal away. They have the right idea about daily accountability and thought the charts were well thought out. But found myself fighting the small format though and ended up throwing it out after a couple weeks of use.
2,the binding is poor,I was disappointed with this purchase after reading so many fantastic reviews. My main complaint is that the binding is of very poor quality. It is hard to flip the pages and I already have wear on mine because of this. I can tell this won't stand up to my gym bag and being used in the gym. It would be good for someone who will only use it at home and doesn't flip through it very much.
3,for the serious trainer,"Great book but I won't be doing 4 sets every day so a lot of wasted recording space for me. I bought diet minder also and prefer that book for entering info. I really think one book would be effective for both - I tend to leave one book on the kitchen counter and one in my gym bag and when I'm on the go , I wish I had remembered the one on the kitchen counter."
3,just ok,"The spaces to write are a little too small. Has good information to fill out, but honestly I won't be buying another. I will continue to use a plain notebook"
5,Meets All Fitness Tracking Needs,"I have used other journals in the past for my workouts, and this one is exceptional. It covers every area of fitness. A worthwhile purchase!"
5,Excellent diet/fitness journal,"This has everything you could ever want to track on a two-page spread. You fill in the dates yourself so pages are never wasted. And it has a very sturdy binding and a discreet black, durable cover. I particularly like the section for medications and vitamins. No other fitness journal I've seen can even compare."
3,Good workout book but not great,"I was looking for a workout book where I could record my exercises daily and the book wouldn't fall apart. I love the coiled spine that will definitely hold the book together. What I don't like is each day is two pages, one side where the daily exercises are recorded and the other side where your daily food intake is recorded. I was only interested in the recording of my exercises so find the opposite page to be a waste. So far though, it is the best journal I have yet to see."
5,Great log!,I love this log! I take it with me everytime I go to the gym! It's the best one out there with everything I need !
5,Everything you need to track your workouts and diet,I just love this journal. It has everything you need: check-offs for cardio equipment; spaces for 4 sets for each strength training exercise; a planning section in the front to lay-out your workouts; an indept measurement/progress section in the back.
4,Nice,"Excellent product includes a section for Diet, weight, supplements and workout. I took mine to the gym for the first week and ended up loosing it. Its better kept at home and great for tracking progress and planning workouts and keeping track of supplements. Be sure to buy a tape measurer to keep track of changes. Also the diet portion is very small but still affective. Also has a place to write down how you are feeling and who your working out with. Even has a part to write down your emotions, I call it the Dr. Phil section."
4,Helps,I think by writing down your daily activities and foods you eat really keeps you on target for your goals!
2,NICE,"GOOD FOR A PERSONAL TRAINER ,BUT FOR ME NOT GOOD AS IT NOT THE RIGHT FIT BUT IF I WAS TRAINING SOME ONE IT WOULD BE GREAT"
3,Space too small,"Great idea, not enough space on pages, returned and switched back to tracking on line. Thought it would be better for meeting with dietician, but will print out from on line."
4,This journal is awesome-I highly recommend,"It has plenty of room for both workouts and food, I have only one complaint. There need to be more categories in the food section, just Calories-Fat-Protein-Carbs. How about sugar, fiber, or saturated fat?"
5,Perfect for the Gym rat,This journal is ideal for anyone who is wanting to get fit. It has space for keeping track of everything you do and eat. I have used three of these so far. Very detailed.
4,BodyMinder Workout and Exercise Journal (A Fitness Diary),"Very helpful tool. I highly recommend this item to anyone who is serious about losing weight and working out. Everything you have to personally record, but it makes you think about how much physical activity you actually do perform instead of estimating."
4,a good buy for someone who worksout at any level,"very detailed in almost everyway. The only thing is I wish there were more nutrition facts but, there is blank spots to add more nutrition facts. The book can do up to 13 weeks. My routine is weight lifting one day cardio the next and I'm putting both those days into one section . Also I'm putting both those days in one nutrition section and because of that I'm going to end up stretching out the book double the amount of days they've alotted .Inconclusion its awesome seeing your progression over time,its also helpful if you need to get your routine down to a science VS all over the gym , and if thats your goal then this is for you."
5,Awesome Journal!,"I love this journal! I've been trying to lose weight, and this journal has helped me develop a consistent workout schedule. It's so easy to track time, reps, intensity, etc. I can keep track of my progress and make sure I keep challenging myself."
1,Very Hard to Use,"This has got to be the the very worst of all answering machines. It was very hard to program, not user friendly at all. The sound was muffled and hard to understand. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one."
4,Great features for the price,"In addition to my personal calls, I am the after hours contact for software support for a large (700+) office. I carry a cell phone to provide this support, but have the calls roll over to my home phone whenever I'm in a position where I can't pick them up. Since all of the calls from the office go through a trunk line, I'm able to have those calls answered with a different message than my family messages, and the school that keeps calling to tell me that some kid I've never heard of didn't bring his lunch money can get their own special message too. I bought it because it was cheap, but I've been more than pleased with what I got for the money."
1,A bad thing brought to life,"I've been extremely disappointed with this answering machine, for two main reasons. First, there is no way to retrieve an erased message. This is especially a problem because the system doesn't really pause after messages as you're playing them back. So after listening to a message you can't hit erase, or you will end up erasing the next (unheard) message. This has happened to me on more than one occasion. Second, the unit often clicks loudly when you pick up the phone, presumably because it's trying to get the caller ID. It's extremely annoying and also has interfered with dial-up connections I was trying to make on more than one occasion. Bottom line, I'd suggest you shop around for something built with real consumers in mind."
2,Would be nice except for intermittent caller-id problem,"With configurable outgoing messages based on caller ID, this machine would be real nice (although you can't configure ring/message options for anonymous callers like you can on the Casio TA-140 & 145). Unfortunately the 29992 suffers from several intermittent flaws. For example, for about 25% of the calls it doesn't record any caller ID information (on the same calls, other caller-ID boxes in the house work just fine). I bought two different 29992 units for my relatives last Christmas and both units had the same intermittent flaws. There was no information in the box on how to contact Thomson Consumer Electronics to resolve these issues, so I sent them back and I bought them the Casio TA-140 from Amazon.com instead."
2,Single White Female 2,"Single White Female 2 was filled with much of the same intrique and drama as SWF #1, minus the sexy suspense and originality.Therein lies the problem, originality. Like most people I do look for a little more action in a sequel, but I also want to be surprised with a new twist from the original version, SWF 2 did not provide this. The characters were dull and uninteresting and offered nothing new to the role.The plot was basically the same as the original only not as good.However, I would still give it one thumb up if you want to watch it on free tv, but I would not spend any money for this movie."
3,Beware the quiet one,"Today you would be looking for a roommate on Craigslist and not in the want ads but it's the same gamble, you never know what mess you may find yourself in. This is pretty much a retelling of the first movie and it's been a while since I saw that,I remember thinking it was pretty good. S.W.F.2 stands on it's own as a made for DVD or skinamax B movie and is worth a look. I like most of the characters in this movie and think to crazy room mate (Allison Lange) play's her part nicely, it's always the quiet one's you need to keep an eye on."
2,Same As Last Film !,"Was a bit disappointed, I was at least expecting a Raw, unadulterated version of the original film. Since it was a straight to video release. No lesbian action, no nudity and Allison Lange is a very attractive girl. They did her no justice in this film with that wig on her head. This writer could have taken this to a new level like ""Poison Ivy 3 : The New Seduction ! Everything was just reacted and poorley executed ! I will give it 2 stars because there was a lot of eyecandy Kristen Miller is a beautiful woman. And I have always thought Allison Lange was cute since ""Christina's House"".There isn't much more to say on this one. Was entertaining just didn't deliver anything new ! U can tell they were operating on a very poor budget.A"
3,"Not bad, for a sequel...","This movie actually wasn't all that bad.Very similar story to the original.The females are a lot better looking than the ones in the first film, that's for sure.I thought this movie might be pretty horrid, but in all actuality, it is a pretty good film.If you liked the first movie, I think you should give this one a try. It's worth owning especially if you have the original movie.Good story, good acting, definitly a thriller.Could have been much worse."
1,What a flop!,This movie was not as good as the first one at all! thought the plot was not good and the acting wasn't that good either.
1,WHY OH GAWD WHY?,"Why when there are talented writers out there with original ideas, do people never see their work and continue to produce this kind of crap?Luv Moms"
4,Battle for the Atlantic DVD,Interesting review of the WW-II fight to keep supplies flowing across the Atlantic to Britian. Interviews with the actual sailors involved as well as filmed action help show the ebb and flow of which nation held the upper hand.
4,Wars of 20th Century,Probably as trueful picture as can be shown of German underseas warfare. Scenes were very authenic. It is just another historical insight to WWII.Very well done.
2,Not exactly erotica,"This collection is well written, but hardly arousing... more depressing or disturbing than erotic. The criteria for eroticism seems to simply be ""it includes mention of sex or genitalia"". A story about an unhappy, unenjoyable encounter with someone just doesn't do it for me. Sure, it's about sex, but it's hardly sexy. I'd pass on this one if I were you- try Best Women's Erotica 2009 instead- much sexier."
3,OFF TO A GOOD START,"Mat Johnson is going to blow up big! He's the next Eric Jerome Dickey! An amazing story-teller. He just needs a really good story to tell. The plot was a little slow and weak at times, but still worth the read. If you like stories about self-evaluation, overcoming struggles and realizing dreams, then you'll enjoy it. Seriously, this could easily have been one of Oprah's book club selections!Members of my book club had mixed feelings. Some thought Chris needed some therapy and a Prozac, but others were more sympathetic to his emotional struggles. When his ""whoa is me"" attitude got to be too much, he finally got it together. Hey, if we didn't have crazy, mixed-up characters like Chris, there would be no interesting stories to tell."
2,Overwritten but underthought,"There definitely is something here, but Johnson seems determined to hide it--or at least more determined than I was to winnow it out from the tangle of his prose and the odd aridity of his plotting. The cities CJ walks through, the characters he interacts with, and even those interactions, seem so subservient to the monstrous weight of adjectives they bear that they are effectively flattened into sameness and indifference. CJ may travel from Philadelphia to London, his dreams may soar outwards and upwards, but they're all without their own weight, and so their flight, their turmoil, and their redemption as well, unfortunately have little more significance than a random fluttering."
5,Nothing less Than I Expected,"I met Mat in college, and he was bright and refreshing, this book was nothing short of that. When I heard he had written a book I bought it because is was a book of someone I once new in college. Well, I was really in for a treat. I enjoyed this book immensely, because I am also a native of Philadelphia and I could see myself in the pages of this book. I laughed so hard my gut hurt and it also made me reflect on how far in life I've come. My friend Debbie bought and read this book also, so when we discussed it, I laughed all over again. How bright, How refreshing, How Mat!!! (smile)"
2,what is all the hype about?,"I bought this book based on the reviews that I saw here. I don't understand what the hype was all about. I am an avid reader , but this book was a monumental task to get through. What a waste! If you absolutely must read this book, borrow it. Don't waste your money. This is a good first effort, but I don't think that this author has found his niche yet. The characters in the book were laughable! David Crumbie was moronic, drunk idiot, I won't give up on Mr. Johnson just yet, but I'LL BORROW his book next time ."
4,photos are good,The illustrations of this book are very good for understanding the works of the artist and the process as well.
3,"This book is ok, but for most fans probably not","This book as described is about the prints, and talks very little about the paintings. There are very nice and clear pictures, but I really only found a few pages interesting, and the rest was just like one long interview about the materials he used and the stories behind who chipped what woodblock and how it got done, etc. Maybe some people will like this book but I only found it slightly interesting."
1,Switch Swatch,"I would not order another watch from this seller. They sent the wrong item. It was listed as a unisex watch and I received a men's watch. The seller refused any responsibility for the error, blaming it on a ""third party"" or on Amazon for listing the product incorrectly. Additionally, the item arrived with a broken case."
1,no good,these don't fit well in anyone's mouth and nobody really liked them. they were in the garbage just a few minutes after trying them. Even the kids thought they were stupid
3,good gag gift,good product. I don't know the durability of it but my old man likes pulling them out when he has company over for kicks.
5,Teeth,My two grandchildren are going to love this for Christmas. I can't wait for them to open their presents. Pleased!
4,Fun in the dark...,"My girlfriend and I had a lot of fun with these last night, but one of us (I won't say who) ended up with a slight injury. Just a little boo-boo... nothing a Bacon Band-aid couldn't cover up.My advice: do not try to give your girlfriend a hickey with one of these in your mouth."
2,Too Hard,These teeth look like a lot of fun but they are made of material that is so stiff and hard that it hurt my gums to have them in place for more than a few minutes. And they're large enough that it was difficult to get my lips around them to make them look somewhat believable. Bummer as they could have been used on so many different occasions for costumes and jokes.
5,GNARLY TEETH,"These teeth are awesome for the price! you can't find this many teeth for that price anywhere--I looked. They don't stay in great, so it's nearly impossible to talk with them in your mouth, but we used them for a short skit in which no one had to talk, so they worked great and got a lot of laughs. Exactly what we wanted them for."
5,For a laugh...,For fun I gave this to someone going to dental school... it was funny... and I got to hear more then I ever wanted to about teeth (Hence the 3 stars for edu but you need to give them to a dental student who loves dental school and sit through the result)... I admit neither of us actually stuck them in our mouths. But yea funny gift.
5,GREAT GIFT,THIS IS A GREAT GIFT TO GIVE TO A BOY OR GIRL . I GAVE THIS TO MY BROTHER AND HE LOVED IT SO MUCH. ITS A VERY FUNNY GIFT.
4,Good,My son loved the teeth and the teeth names. The teeth would sometime scratch the inside of mouth causing light bleeding. Son is 7.
2,Shreds and sticks,"This particular product shreds and sticks in my teeth. Just two or three strokes through my teeth and the string has shredded into strands and is sticking. Pulling it out takes more effort and leaves strands behind. Nothing unusual about my teeth which are in good shape. At some point, there was an apparent change in the construction of this floss brand: J&J ""Reach Mint Waxed"". I found an old package of J&J plain waxed and do not have this problem with it. The old floss is thinner, slicker, glides easily, does not stick, does not shred and seems just as effective as the stringy stuff. I will be looking for a different brand."
5,GREAT,"Good price, doesn't flunk, arrived quick :) more random words to fill in the 14 words required to submit this post"
1,Absolutely horrible!,"This is a bastion of conservative viewpoints from a man who seeks to turn back the clock on black america. If you are African American or a democrat of any color, you should read this to find out exactly what we are all up against.A bigoted, sensless journey from a man who must truly hate himself and his color. Conservatives must be having a field day.After reading this one, do yourself a favor and throw it in the trash!"
3,A Real Hero,"While not completely convinced by his arguments, I was greatly impressed with his own life story and the integrity which shone through this book. The cowardice and underhandedness of those on the other side of his fight is disheartening."
4,"terrific, classic, compact Western; great cast; real treat","Wonderful western. Hidden treat; especially enjoyable surprise as the film is not discussed in Western film books. Amazing the way so many characters, plot twists, romance, action, scenery, morality could be squeezed into this 1-1/2 hour color Republic ""A"" film. Well written, cast, photographed and directed. Your only regret will be that it is over, only 1-1/2 hours of it. Take a look at the cast! This will restore your faith in Westerns. Good pulp work. Enjoyable. Keep a paper and pencil to keep track of the characters."
5,Civil War,My son is a history major at college and needed this book for class. The price was affordable and a book he will have for many years to use in his teaching career.
2,Didn't quite do the job...,"This product was a replacement for one that was damaged by my maintenance guy. It got really hot when we hooked it up. I'm pretty sure it was involved in my cable box being killed, as it stopped powering on altogether shortly after I hooked this up."
3,The Old Foggies Society,"OK, I have just viewed this movie and for a campy 70's Satanic Horror movie, it is not bad. A simple yet entertaining plot, ok acting and a wicked ending. For a movie which is plotted on the worship of Satan, there is no nudity for a change, cool design sets, and Strother Martin portrays the Devilish high priest and his coven of witches and warlocks hang on his every word, which in some instances is quite articulate. The plot is just like most plots, family get lost in some backwoods town and then get caught up in all the action, but in this movie the protagonist does not come out unscathed. The sherrif, priest and deputy seem lost in space when trying to solve the mystery which provides some comic relief. The ending is excellent so I will not spill the beans in that regard. Not digitally remastered and the imperfections of the film are evident, but not a bad movie for the price."
5,Prey on the Children,"First off -- I have to say that I was truly amazed at the quality of this DVD transfer. It looks like it was made yesterday, except of course for the early 70's vehicles used in it. Brotherhood of Satan accomplishes what most horror films don't -- truly spooky atmospherics that creep into most of the moments of tension building. The cult itself is humorous with ""I have nothing which isn't thine"" over and over, but the unintended humor only adds to the enjoyment of the film. The DVD is a bit pricey but worth it for the movie itself which is beautifully photographed. It has no extras in terms of the film itself, oddly there are trailers for other films on the disc, but none for this film. The DVD is remastered in High Definition and it shows!!! Check this one out, I don't think you will be disappointed!!"
1,Do you have to be a Satanist to get it?,"This movie was not good, not good at all. It was as if they wrote the thing, and then decided not to finish it with an ending. I guess maybe if you are a Satanist you might get it, but for regular (non devil-worshipers) save your time and money. No scares, no laughs, no gore, no nothing. This movie ...."
1,Important tool for unionists,"This easy-to-understand little book is a must-have for every local union trustee and auditor, providing the know-how and confidence needed to spot problems so they can be promptly reported and corrected. It offers a basic road map of procedures and a toolbox of skills and worksheets to help auditors and trustees accomplish their jobs. And it's a big help to local union treasurers as well, especially those new to the job.Contents include: Rights and responsibilities of local union trustees; reviewing income sources; analyzing union assets; understanding disbursements; completing your audit; summarizing your results, presenting your report; handling discrepancies and problems.The book is filled with sample forms and worksheets to help you do the job. Each chapter ends with exercises designed to help readers master the contents.Formerly published by Cornell University ILR Press; original edition, with new acknowledgements.Five stars, not the one you see above!"
2,Do I laugh or do I gag? (I can't believe I'm the only one),"I wasn't expecting much in the first place after having bought CDs like Era and Industrial Monk ages ago and pretty much loathing them. All of these groups ARE cheap imitations of great bands like Enigma and Delerium. There is nothing unique about them. Or nothing good. I do like the chants on ""Mystic Spirit Voices,"" but that's it. The music is pretty bad, especially the cheesy wailing electric guitars. And the English vocals...AWFUL! They got some woman to try to sound like Sandra, the main Enigma vocalist, making them even more of a cheap imitation of the King. The lyrics are so ridiculously cheesy, too. These people are not the prophets they think they are. Enigma's lyrics are deep, original, and heartfelt. These are not. They make me want to laugh, if anything. Plus, this CD has a much greater Christian undertone than any of the other wannabes, which repels me quite a bit. 'Nuff said."
2,Q: What happens when a bunch of angry monks buy a laptop with Pro Tools on it?,"Hey, I don't blame people for trying to rip off Enigma; Michael Cretu and Co. have seemingly cornered the market on sensual rhythmic monk chanting music. But there is a reason for that -- it is not easy to do well (though Delerium seems to have not only matched their predecessor but exceeded it). And frankly, all Elesiem has managed to do here is create church music with drum loops. In theory it sounds like it might work, but in practice it alternates between boring and forced. Not to mention all of the songs sound the same.To mention Elesiem in the same breath as Enigma is ignorant."
4,"Very nice,,",",,,after having recently discovered the sound of Lesiem i think this one is propably their best over the years,,this is very cool music in my opinion and the voices and the beat brilliantly performed,,,my hats off for Lesiem and looking forward for a new material"
1,missing 4 songs,"this is not a review of the music itself, because i liked it, but for leaving out 4 songs on the American release of the cd, actually 3 and a half, one is the choir version of Liberta. i can understand rearrangement of song orders or even extra track as regional exclusive, but 4 songs never made it here? seriously wtf, it's not like European cds have extra capacity, sigh time to get to amazon germany and get the real experience intended by the artists."
5,You will listen again and again,"I was introduced to Lesiem by a good friend who felt that I would like the CD. I am normally a listener of jazz and classic rock. However, Lesiem's 'Mystic Spirit Voices' is now one of my top 5 favorite albums ever. It has music that will move your spirit and release emotions. I encourage you to listen to it and introduce it to your friends."
4,Handschar Division,"This book is by far the most detailed work in the English language on this division, and helps fill a very important gap in today's often highly contentious historiography of the former Yugoslavia. All concerned with the background of the current crisis in the Balkans, especially the conflicts in Bosnia-Hercegovina, will benefit by reading this work."
4,Very good work,The work reviews the history of the Muslims troops in the Balkans during the last two years of the WWII. It examines the efforts of the Grand Mufti's involvement in the creation of the unit. The author brings to light the ineffectiveness of the formation in the fighting in the Balkans for the Nazi regime.
3,"Great book, although much is ignored.","I am so happy to have found a book about the handschars. Much interesting info can be found here although I do infact have a couple of complaints. First of all,even though Lepre states in his preface that he would not get into detail about the Croatian state at it has been written about over and over, I feel that his work in these areas were far too short.Because yet again in the war of the 90's as in ww2, the muslims initially sided with the croatians and had great numbers serving in the croat army. So some more information on the croatian - muslim relationship would have been great."
3,It is not enough to give true picture,"I had a chance to read this book in my language and I believe that it could be taken as a reference for English speaking readers but it far to be the best book on this issue. Writer should give more details about situation in Bosnia during Nazi occupation. He should tell readers that Bosnian Muslims were exposed to terrible massacres from both Serbs and Croats. The only, the wrong one, shelter was in own Army. Some of them took 13th SS Division as an embryo for their own state inside so calld New World ""Noe Welt "".By the way I think that is not OK to publish anonymous reviews as you did for this book.It is not OK to suggest this book to US trups in Bosnia because book gives blured picture about todays acters in Bosnan war."
5,Terriffic!,"For all of us who have bought one cd of the same old oldies to procure an obscure track, here's the payback. Lots of great little known tracks in typical Rhino sound. Now if we can only get them to do a similar follow up to the disco box.......!"
3,Nice collection for the hardcores.,"Nice collection of OBSCURITIES, the only place you'll find some of these tracks on CD. Some are off of vinyl.Good variance of artists, yet some of the tracks are truly sleepers, and a bit heavy on the Motown sound - starts to sound the same after a while. Does the price verify the packaging? It's neat & all, but...Nice HUGE booklet with great artist info & memorabilia. Overall, heaven for some...so-so for the moderate listener."
5,Excellent reading and images,"This book is great because it gives a very readable overview of the main Biblical stories. The illustrations are a plus and make the stories easy to absorb and remember. The sidebars provide very useful information. There appears to be a high degree of scholarship in the analyses. Of course, because this is a ""family"" bible, perhaps a few of the more sordid elements may not be covered. Still, this is a wonderful way to get an overall feel for the Old and New Testaments"
2,Really hideous artwork.,Not up to the quality of most DK books - beware! Only a few small photographs here and there. Mostly drawn illustrations that look very dated. The artwork spoils what otherwise would be an OK book overviewing the Bible. Also weighs about 20 lbs! Hard to hold.
5,DK Family Illustrated Bible,A very interesting copy of the Bible (NIV) with illustrations that give archealogical and historical perspective.
5,5 STARS PLUS 20000 MORE!!,"Excellent Palm!! Better than previous Palms, All Handsprings, etc. This thing rocks!!! The screen is almost unscratchable unless you take a rock to it!! ONE BIG PLUS is that it uses a plasic screen and not glass (glass=harder to break).....This Palm is much better than my old Handspring Visor Deluxe.Downside-more expensive, but IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!"
3,Screen too small,"This unit performs well, and would be a decent value for the price if not for the screen size. Take one look at a Visor compared to this unit, and you will see what I mean"
4,"Finally, I feel organized...........","I received my Palm m125 as a gift. It is easy to use. It syncs easily to my PC and the software included is helpful. Furthermore, I have found many compatible/useful freeware programs that are handy to carry around in my Palm. I am a health care professional and the amount of Palm m125 medical software out there is amazing!!I find only one downfall. The back light is too intense for dim-light rooms, and so there doesn't appear to be enough contrast between the foreground text and the back light.All in all, I would recommed this to anybody who wants more than the basic PDA but doesn't want to spend $400 plus. It's a good buy!!"
2,Save your money...,"I bought my Palm with high expectations and it came through at first but all the Palm 125 does is the functions of a m100 plus it has a little more memory and a memory card slot. After a month of use using the graffiti pad, the built in software no longer recognizes any of its programmed graffiti functions and I have to use the built in keyboard to type dates and appointments. PalmSupport is a waste of your time for they just send you a form letter with no real help. The palm is good for reading news off the internet or playing games when you're bored outside of the home but next time I get a organizer, im getting a Franklin Covey planner instead!"
3,Nice but Slow!,"Tested with Benchmark 2.0, with base comparison to Palm IIIxe, Palm m125 only 154% faster while Visor Platinum 204% and Sony Clie 320 203% at the same processor clock speed. What's a pitty that Palm can't make its own original device as faster as its competitor."
4,Good Deal!!!,It's very good for its features and price. If you don't think a bigger screen is mandatory you get all m500 job done and with a nicer look. Palm and accessories sellers should have a section on m125 to make finding and fitting stuff less confusing and easier.
1,Stay away,After having to return two M125's due to a defective digitizer I would advise any potention M125 purchaser to steer clear. I should have read the reviews prior to my initial purchase. After returning unit #2 I decided to give Palm one more shot w/the M130 and love it!. Do yourself a huge favor and stay far away from the M125.
1,My review of this palm pilot,"This palm pilot [is odd] for the following reasons.1. It broke. (batteries were dying when I played w/it- and they were new)2. Its slow as a pine tree. (It moves, but it takes hours. AND YES THE BATTERIES WERE BRAND NEW!)3. I don't own it.4. My friend has one and this is how I know all this."
3,Watch It - Palm 125 will Reset,"My boyfriend and I both bought a Palm 125 in March 2003. It is great for keeping appointments, addresses, and to do lists. Just watch out if you need support. Palm will only support the software for 90 days and will charge after that. Both of us have had problems with ""hard resets,"" where all the data is wiped out. This has not happened because the battery died (as Palm suggested) or from physically hitting the reset button. If you buy a 125, be sure and hot sync quite often, you will need to restore at some point."
3,Good except for batteries,"I have been using my m125 since Christmas and it is my first PDA. I like a lot of the functions and have found it easy to use. Unfortunately, I was not aware that rechargable batteries do not work well with this device. (I knew it didn't have internal rechargables, but I thought I would be able to use AAA NiMH batteries.) I have tried two brands and have had no success. I finally got a new set to work for a few days, but they just caused a hard crash of my PDA, causing some loss of data. (I had hooked it up to the cable to synch right when it crashed...)Palm products in general seem to be good and this may be an appropriate model for someone who travels a lot and would rather use up regular alkalines than try to deal with dragging along a cradle or charging cable. I, however, wish I'd know about this problem, because I would have chosen a different model."
2,Old Eyes,"I had problems by order of importance to me with my first 2 because:1. Stylus interface to screen--req'd excess pressure--alignment to icons inconsistent - after repeated calibration--text inconsistent, i.e. ""I"" comes up with ""F"" as worst onehappened with other letters (both units) 2nd unit better butstill had ""I"" problem though lesser extent.2. Monochrome screen is hard on my eyes - decided color is best.3. Screen size is too small. Prefer the larger though bulkierwider screen.Currently owner of a 2 meg Palm IIIE. I have a basis of comparison as to sytlus pressure which is fine with this unit.The ""new and improved"" were polar opposite on this score."
1,Palm m125,"I returned three defective 125's in three weeks. The tapping function on the lower left of the screen stopped working on two palms. The third one would not turn on and once it did , all of my data was deleted. I think that the integrity and the quality of the hardware is poor to say the least. However, the software function was excellent and easy to use. I was very disappointed that the product was defective. I suggest spending a little more and going to the SONY CLIE PEG-T415. It is an excellent PEO and worth every penny."
3,Palm m125 user and advice,"I am satisfied with this product except for the battery usage. Turns out that in some of these units the 'ultracapacitors' were leaking and eventually were shorting out. Ultracapacitors maintain the device memory during battery changes. This leaking/shorting caused the following:- immediate loss of data memory when batteries removed- high drain of new batteries - sometimes only lasting 1 day in my caseIf you are technically handy with a soldering iron, you can order 2 new ultracapacitor parts from Digikey (<$10) and solder them in yourself. I did this 3 years ago and have had great results - no loss of memory when changing batteries and new batteries last over 3-4 weeks with moderate use."
4,I Think I Like It,"I bought the Palm m125 a few days ago to replace my Palm IIIxe. I managed to fry the circuits with some water. The screen is smaller to me and I have changed the fonts to be as big as possible. I had had some hotsync problems with my previous unit, I even had to by a new cradle. The hotsync on this one worked like a charm. My biggest worry was whether I had a USB connection back there but I found it with no problem.I guess my misgivings stem from liking the IIIxe so much and it was my first. But, as they say, Change is Good. I'll give it some time."
1,Must be like the old Volvos,"Remember when you were a kid and automobiles were less ""consistent"" than they are now? I can recall friends of my parents who had Volvos and either loved theirs or hated it. You either got one that worked well, or you got a lemon. My m125 is a lemon. My wife bought it for my birthday a while back and I made the mistake of putting off using it. By the time I tried to get it to speak to my computer (Outlook never happened), stop freezing up, move from one function to another, and just BEHAVE, there was no warranty left. It is a dog, with fleas. Customer Service sent a lengthy form tutorial via e-mail, that basically told me to ""reboot"". Fool that I am, I tried that a few times. My wife gets to stare at the world's cutest white elephant every time she sits down at her CPU. Her disappointment is palpable. The lesson, then, was two-fold. Take it out for a spin during the warranty period, or don't buy it at all. My own lesson will be to get a Dell."
3,Let the buyer beware,"When Palm's products work, which in all fairness is most of the time, they're great. But pity the poor fool who needs to call customer support - a $25 fee to answer a question? absurd!I have to give them some credit, when they could not fix my problem over the phone, they did refund the $25 and offered me a 20% discount on an upgraded model - I declined. Take some friendly advise and read what people who've bought Palm (or Sony or Handspring) products have to say in their reviews. Since my Palm crashed about a month ago I've been reseaching what to replace it with- the jury's still as all products seem to get mixed reviews. It's too bad, I really miss my little handheld but I may just stick with my Dell laptop. Good luck."
3,rechargeable batteries not included,"This is a good entry model unit for playing with but a real unit should be able to run on recharchable batteries and come with rechargeable batteries. Unfortunately that means a higher price up front -- but considering the alkaline battery cost you'll save over the life of the product (not to mention saving the environment some battery waste) I think its worth it to step up to say the m130 (that's what I'm going to do :)BTW: the battery having to be alkaline was not real clear up front, I figured any rechargables would replace them but that doesn't seem to be the case unless I just have the wrong type."
3,Good feel but Glitchy Performance,"This unit feels great in your hand, screen is small but very clear. The big complaint that have and I'm not sure if its isolated to this unit is when I replace the batteries it gives no alternative but to erase the data, then restore it. Not good to say the least, makes this unit useless if I have to take it on the road. No way to fix that problem in the field."
5,my first handheld,"i've read a few reviews about people having problems with their palm or the screen being too small. i haven't had any problems with mine and i think the screen size is fine. if it was any smaller it'd definitely be a problem, but my opinion is that the m125 is great. of course, i've never tried any other handhelds and i am one of the most unorganized people in the world, so the m125 to me has been a revolution.if you've tried other brands, then this review probably has no value to you, but if you are like me and anything would do, then the m125 is a great tool for organizing your life."
2,Think Read and then buy....BUT,"Plam introduced this m125, but they forgot to mention that their product hogs a lot of battery when used. So I just dont recomend a model which does not have a inbuilt chargeable battery. It turns out to be slightly cheap but with higher risks and peoblems. The data loss is highly torturing. I planned to use NiMH AAA bateries instead and the problems came down considerably. But that swaping business comes into action...so thats another overhead.=================What Palm/PalmOne shud have done is make that model charge NiCad/NiMH batteries like some CD players do...inside the battery case itself. This way the Palm becomes cheaper and the user is having a choice of using chargeable or non chargeable batteries."
1,don't bother with this one,"My trusty Palm IIIxe finally wore out and I decided to purchase another Palm PDA to replace it because the IIIxe worked so well for me. All I need is a basic PDA and it seemed that the m125 would handle my needs. It has been a real disappointment. The IIIxe fit the docking cradle securely and reliably; for some reason, the m125 is much trickier to fit into the docking cradle. The plastic cover looks and feels flimsy. Compared to the IIIxe it eats batteries. Finally, after a couple of months it just plain stopped working. Although I'm frugal, I decided I didn't need the trouble of an unreliable PDA and went ahead and bought a Toshiba that works beautifully. I would have been happy with another IIIxe, but unfortunately Palm made the decision to replace it with a new but inferior model. No wonder they are losing market share."
2,"Between the batteries and customer service, is it worth it?","I have had my m125 for over 1 year now. Really I have loved it and what I have been able to do with it. What I hate is the unreliability with the batteries and whether I will face a total data loss when I swap batteries every 2 weeks or so (we have also faced a hot sync problem with multiple users). When I called to ask Palm if this was a recurring problem with m125s the man tried to charge me $25 to get the question answered. Then when I refused to pay $25 for the question, the rep actually laughed at me. So I took it took the next step and submitted an e-mail asking the same question and requesting the company's complaint process. PalmOne did respond, however not to any of my questions. Apparently they do not resolve complaints. Oh but they'll give me a 20% upgrade discount on select models online - whatever. The most information I received was actually reading the other reviewers here at Amazon and their problems with batteries."
2,will not connect without tons of work! better off spending more money,This product sucks and I wish I would have spent 10 or 15 dollars more and just gotten a usb device for wireless instead! I would rather spend a little more money then waste hours trying to figure this thing out!
5,In My Own Backyard,"Of the many books about the development of Southwest Florida, Fields of Hope is one of the most enlightening and interesting. As a child growing up in nearby Naples, Immokalee was always that place we only went to for fresh vegetables at the Farmer's Market. When I became an adult and chose my profession and volunteer activities, Immokalee became a much different place to me, with a wonderfully warm population of mixed cultures and colors. This book is a beautiful representation of Immokalee and richly explains how Immokalee came to be."
4,immigrating to survive,"This is a wonderful and moving account of the lives of recent immigrants to SW Florida. Not educated Europeans like me but the poorest of the poor, mainly from Haiti, Guatemala and Mexico.The book recounts the personal stories of many of the immigrants but also gives a historical and political background on the countries these people immigrated from. It is never a dull history book; it written fluently and provides context and perspective. It also shows how Florida's agribusiness can only exist through these workers.I live in Naples, less than 1 hour away from Immokalee, yet almost on a different planet. This book is an absolute eye-opener, it brings the human aspect into immigration and shows that much more compassion is needed. A must read for anyone interested in Florida."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,It turns out that this is NOT the 46 minute documentary on eating disorders. It is only 17 minutes and $9.99 is a ridiculous amount of money to rent it (let alone $45 to buy)!
1,"Errors, errors, errors galore","The author of the CD that came with the book did not bother to actually read the book, review the information on the CD, proofread and edit. There are SO MANY errors and inconsistencies between the two that if a prospective student with no accounting background were to use this book/CD set to set up an accounting system, it would be full of errors, assuming that the student didn't just give up in confusion and disgust. I would not recommend this book to anyone. In fact, if it were possible to give this book zero stars, I would."
5,Best music guide I have ever read hands down.,What else is there to say... It has not steered me wrong once. The suggestions as to what recordings are the best of works that have been recorded dozens of times are particularly helpful. A healthy number of 20th century composers too!
5,Billy Joe Shaver IS the Real Deal - No Doubt!,"I saw first Billy Joe Shaver on the CMT Outlaw show hosted by Merle Haggard and Toby Keith in early November. I heard Mr. Shaver sing two songs, both of which are on this wonderful CD. I was spellbound knowing I was hearing the raw truth especially after listening to him tell what happened to his family. I went out the next day and bought this great CD. I listen to Billy Joe Shaver every day. I keep hitting ""repeat"" button on ""Try Try Again"" and ""I'm Going to Live Forever"". I truly can't get enough of his songs now that I have discovered him."
4,Billy is the best,"Billy Joes songs have mesmerized me ever since i first heard ""old five and dimers like me"". He is truly a legend in country music. The only thing that keeps me from giving this five stars is the inclusion of Big and Rich on the album. If he is not careful he will be lumped in with other older performers who ride on the coattails of popular modern ""country"" artists."
4,This is almost the best book ever,"You will not believe how deeply moving and fascinating learning about the aspects of contemporary norway can be. This book will blow your mind, and make you reconsider not only Norway but all of northern europe. Avoid this book at your own peril."
4,You get what you pay for.,"This is about the lowest quality binder you can buy, mine arrived with the plastic already beginning to split. That said, they are cheap. Real cheap. I'm using it to organize a few things that won't be accessed often, so I'm not too worried about wear and tear. If that's all your looking to do, these will give you the best bargain. If you're looking for a binder that will see frequent use or be carried around, definitely pay the premium for a higher quality binder."
2,binders,"The vinyl at the top of one of the four binders was puckered, thus unsatisfactory. I phoned the distributor the day after receiving the product and left a message but my call was not returned."
4,Great binder!,"I like this binder a lot! It is very sturdy, beautiful in color, and is the perfect size for what I am looking for. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a little on the pricey side for just a plain binder, but I definitely would recommend it to anyone."
2,Poor quality,The plastic on the binder is very fragile broke as soon as I opened it. Haven't started using it simply put some paper in it and it's already falling apart.
3,ok binder but did not come with any women.,"I, being a single guy, heard that there are binders full of women, so i decided to order one online, i got this binder in the mail and i figure at least if it contained no actual women then it would have phone numbers or emails of said women, nothing. The binder was empty. The binder itself as a binder is ok but when i want a binder full of women i want one that is full of women.I would recommend other binders then this one if you need women."
2,Starting ripping after a month,"The binders look heavy duty, but after a mere 3 weeks, all of them were ripping in the seams and I had to tape them with duct tape. I ended up buying new binders. The seams should be reinforced so that they can handle the weight. Kids often will be grabbing binders from just the front or back cover (with the seams absorbing the weight of the full binder), but these binders couldn't handle it. Maybe it's just my kid who is rough with them, but I bought three and all three were ripping down the seams in less than a month."
3,cheap but OK quality.,"It is a nice green folder, I was looking for something cheap. It does its job, there haven't been any issues. I have been using it from last 6 months and the side corner is torn now. So not A+ quality, but good enough."
2,Poor quality,I am disappointed in the lack of durability of this item. The rings are not very strong nor is the covering. I would recommend buying a heavier quality binder.
1,Defective Upon Arrival,"This binder is very cheaply made. When I received it, the vinyl was cracked in four places (1/2""+ in two places). The edges were very sharp. It was immediately returned for a refund. I do not recommend this product."
3,"OK, will do but Avery is better",I got a great price on these that is the main reason I am giving 3 stars but they seem to be a litte flimsy. Avery is much better
3,color,"Please note, the color of the binder pictured is a teal/blue-green color. This is not the color of the actual binder. The actual binder is a regular dark green color."
1,"Cheap, you get what you pay for","I wanted cheap binders for school...After being stuck in my bag with my casebooks, the rings bent and were no longer serviceable. This happened to both of them. Upon examination of other binders I got (same type, diff color), the rings don't seem to be well made. They have a mini-gap between them and they look flimsy. Will buy better ones next time."
2,Cheap binder,"The rings crush easily on this. I bought it because my son needed a two inch three ring binder for sixth grade. He's not particularly tough on his school supplies, but this survived less than one month."
1,Not happy,I ordered 3 of these binders and 2 of them were cracked and ripped when I got them. I went online to look at getting new ones but it would cost more for me to return the current ones that it would to just buy new ones. I am not pleased and would like them to send me 2 new ones without having to return the old ones.
4,Not This Virginia,"The stories in this collection vary from the profound to the wistful to the grandly comic. Among the more highly mentionable are ""macs"", ""The Player"" and ""First Fire"", all of which will linger in the mind long after the last page has been turned. But for me, the one that reached me the most was ""Not This Virginia"". Anyone who has ever had to deal with an elderly parent in decline will find something in this story. It touches the soul and says no, you are not alone. Thank you, Terry."
1,A book this bad...,"...doesn't deserve to be in print. Terry Bisson has to be the absolute worst writer ever to be published. It only took three chapters from ""In The Upper Room and Other Likely Stories"" for me to determine that TB is completely untalented and probably got most of his ideas about writing from a weekend seminar called ""Repetition is Funny or How to Say Things Until They Are Funny"". I take that back, TB has one talent, and that is his talent to take a perfectly good premise and completely butcher it with his repetitive, dull and close minded style. I gave him three chances and he blew it three times in a row with the first three stories in this book. All the good ideas got mangled by his inept, sorry excuse for style. He is a one trick pony that is funny only by accident and even then not very. Mostly I found myself feeling sorry for the poor slob. Skip this book. I got it from the library and I am thinking of suing them mental anguish. Yuck yuck yuck... Avoid at all costs!"
1,Appalling sound quality,"The unit may be attractive, and have nice features, but that can't compensate for the atrocious sound quality that makes it practically useless.Voices are harsh, garbled, fuzzy and have an unnatural electronic tone. Also, if the speaker does not speak in a consistently load and clear tone, the sound just drops out completely (you don't even get the pause, so its almost impossible to guess what is being said). I have lots of messages to call at, say, 25149.I have also experienced the problem, noted by another reviewer, of the unit erroneously indicating memory full and refusing to function.I long for my old Panasonic tape-based answering machine, which preceded this one. Are all digital machines this bad, or is this GE model particularly egregious?I'll be throwing this unit out shortly...and kicking myself for not returning it when I could."
2,two stars for two machines in two months.,"great machine when it is working, but the digital memory flashes ""full"" when there is nothing in the memory. as a result it does not function as answering machine. can't get the erase function work."
1,GE 29868GE1 Digital Answering Machine,"I bought this machine hastily to replace my Bell South which only lived a short life. This machine was a waste of money. About once every 2 weeks it randomly displays a ""F"" for full, even if there were no messages on it, which requires you to pull the battery and power supply to reset the machine. The battery backup doesn't work (the machine resets itself when the power goes out, erasing the messages, even with a brand-new battery). Wait, did I just contradict myself? NO, the battery will not save the messages if the power goes out, but you still have to unplug it to reset the machine when it crashes.To top it off, the sound quality is awful; people who speak softly cannot be understood at all. I typically don't think highly of GE products, and this one is no exception. My next machine will be from a different company."
5,Anna Blundy is an undiscovered gem,"This book is powerful and moving, not to mention thrilling and exiting. Seriously, Anna Blundy delivers a fine balance of adventure and emotion in this book, which is undoubtedly her best, I would say, excepting that I have not read Double Shot yet."
1,I dont like the watch I bought from you.,The watch I bought has a very bad quality.I feel very sorry.
5,3 ring binder,This product may not have been name brand but it is just as good with a buch better price. This was received earlier than expected with no problems. I would recomend this product to any one who is in an office.
5,"A ""must have"" title for those who like their music dark...","Charles Edwards is the leader of Colorado based Seraphim Shock. His lead vocals are highly lyrical, occasionally gritty, and should not be missed. In Halloween, Sex, and Las Vegas, SS takes their music to a whole new level. From their techno-goth origins, they amp up this offering with a heavy leavening of Las Vegas/psychobilly flavor.Morning Star is haunting. Sex Toy unforgettable. And White Trash Satan almost a ballad for my generation.Buy this CD."
5,Great CD,it's an awesome album i saw them live and picked it up... it is amazing a perfect blend of silky haunting vocals and goth metal with a definete kick. i have to say though the listings on here are majorly over priced. i picked it up for $15 at the show.
5,Miraculous Living,This is a wonderful book. It has transformed my life and continues to be a resource for support and peace when I need it. I highly recommend it.
5,Beautiful language ; clearly her heart's experience.,"The author writes about the Kaballah, a jewish mystic, as about her own experiences in very clear and beautiful language. I read and reread the book and still enjoy reading it very much. When reading it is as if I may join in the spiritual experiences of the author, which are very normal day to day experiences of deep stillnes. In ten chapters Shoni Labowitz describes the 10 sephirot of the tree of life and each chapter is devided again in paragraphs in which she describes aspects of the sephirot. These paragraphs are like meditations, in simple and very beautiful language. And when reading I notice that each sephira can be a part of my daily life. That's the beauty of the book for me: spiritual experience is not out of reach and holy and only for very spiritual people, but living day by day with both feet on the ground, enjoying life in many facets."
5,"Journey the ""Path of the Tree""","I have read this book and loved it so much that I've taken notes and returned to it over and again.Based on teachings from the Kabbalah's Tree of Life and the ten branches (Heavenly Gates) that are said to be touched by a particular power of God. Each chapter is devoted to a 'branch' of the Tree.I enjoy studying the RWS Tarot, and have found that through reading this, it has given new meaning and understanding to the images in the cards that never occurred to me before. Reading certain things here would remind me of a scene on a particular card and I would think: ""That is SO what that means!"" Supposedly tarot cards have a history that is connected to/from Kabbalah so it makes sense that principles from this ""Tree"" would correlate so perfectly with the cards.Reading this is like a tool to help you grow and explore more deeply in your spirituality and your life. So much good information on how to live."
5,Love it,Assisting my husband and I to do meditations. We are so happy to read her work and see what she has to offer
4,The Dao and Kabbalah in Harmony,"Rabbi Labowitz has penned a smart book, showing the perceivable harmony between the Chinese metaphysical, spiritual practice of Daoism and its counterpart in Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition. She thus shows, what others cannot or will not see, how to harmonize mystical traditions, creating peace and harmony across cultures and setting up people for sensing their highest ideals and most holistic practices, un-distracted by pretty divisive boundaries, egos, and energy-draining disputes. This book is best applied to a meditative practice, a pre-existing commitment to supporting the good, a friendly and open attitude towards people and life. It won't solve all problems, nor is it necessarily intended to. The spirit of love permeates this book. If that spirit does not animate you, you will get nothing from this amazing expression of love, tolerance, and human potential.The Torah"
5,great book,great book. Unfortunately my wife already had a copy and had used it in a Jewish book club
5,"An Outdated Therapy For The ""Me"" Generation Of The 1970's!!!","This book was first published in the 1970's when it appeared that nearly everybody was dissatisfied with their lives and sought a ""Miracle Cure"" through Therapy. In this book Dr. Janov displays gross intolerance for legitimate, proven Traditional Therapies and insists he has THE CURE(!!!) for self obsessed ""neurotics' as he refers to his patients. Furthermore he detests the overspending by consumers in our Society yet he offers a ""Finance Plan"" to his potential troubled clients.It seems like his Therapy involves lying down in a dark room and saying things like ""Mommie why is Daddy so mean to me and how come he drinks so much?' . There is nothing that Dr. Janov can offer which can't be fixed by a moderate dosage of Diazapam and Stelazine. I give this book 5 stars because I did find the endless whinings of his patients to be most amusing."
3,"Location, Location, Location!","It's a great idea for Oz to go to a Buddhist monastery in search of control, but contemporary Tibet just isn't the place for that to be happening. Newsflash to Christopher Golden: Tibet has been occupied by the Chinese for a while and the monasteries have been either destroyed or turned into tourist showplaces empty of spirituality. If Golden had transplanted the story line to Nepal, it would have worked very nicely. On the other hand, a wolfed out Oz unleashed on the Chinese occupying forces, might have been a powerful deterrent to genocide."
3,"Decent Read, Could Have Been Better","I enjoyed the book. It wasn't spectacularly insightful, but it didn't leave me bored, either. Those who complain that the character is not Oz seem to be completely discounting what we saw in the character in Season 4-- when he left and when he came back. Not to say the characterization wasn't a bit off some places (I can't see Oz ""swearing loudly""), but not to the degree other reviews would suggest."
4,Actual thinking required!,"I'm a retired school teacher and I enjoy working with my grandchildren while they use the Clue Finder's software. When an adult interacts, these programs require logic and planning, rather than just guessing. This ""Mathra"" program has inspired my 2 hesitant granddaughters to believe in their math ability. And they have all learned the importance of listening and following directions."
3,Light and entertaining-good beach book,"When Phoebe Mullins' husband dies, he leaves her without any money or skills, she lands a job as a secretary for an opera camp in Easthampton. Shortly thereafter, the baritone for the production of Cosi Fan Tutti is dead of an allergic reaction to penicillin, and the opera star who owns the camp delegates the solution of the murder to Phoebe, along with the programs and costumes for the production.This is a light and entertaining mystery with little substance. The characters are amusing. This book is perfect to take to the beach or on vacation where you need an entertaining diversion, but don't want to think too much."
3,Shocking death with less than shocking ending,"Wonderful read about the world of music, opera in particular, and exculsive summer music schools in idyllic settings. Too bad I figured out the plot and the culprit way before the end of the novel. Too many details about the characters involved pointed the finger to the real culprit, too soon. Looking forward to the author's next book, however..."
4,Good boot ... just started using,My boys both got a pair - we have had several adventures. The boots are comfortable and waterproof within normal expectations (kids wonder why their feet are wet when the foot is submerged). good all purpose boot for young kids.
2,To stiff for kids.,I purchased this for my 11 year old backpacker who has 125 lifetime miles. He just finished 42 miles backpacking the Gran Teton Loop via Cascade Canyon. I wish I would have bought him Keens Pyrenees instead. These boots are way to stiff. We buy high end super light gear. He averaged 8 lbs as his pack weight carrying everything except food in his pack. Not enough weight to worry about a stiff shank. It is better to have more flexible shoe to prevent blisters.
5,Thought Provoking AND Enjoyable!,"The book effectively addresses a variety of aspects found in ""everyday life"":issues --such as the stock market and schizophrenia-- offer thought provoking perspectives and discussions. Scheibe is a master at combining pyschological principles and social theory with poignant illustrations and vignettes. A refreshing read for the professional or student, and a palapable journey for the simply curious."
3,pretty...but only so-so,"It's shiny and beautiful but you have to fiddle with it so it will go underneath the staple. It also tends to tear the paper. I'm dealing with mostly 20-30 papers. Might be that it works better with 50 or 100 but the problem I have is that it just doesn't slip under the staple so you have to jiggle it and squeeze a little to loosen the staple enough to properly insert and in the process the top paper is getting damaged at the staple site. I'm using a Bostitch Heavy Duty Stapler (B310HDS) with 3/8 staples.Too bad because as chrome items go, this one is beautiful."
2,pretty tasteless,"this instant coffee does not have much of a mocha flavor. 21g of carbs, 12g of sugar. don't know what else to say except this isn't very good. i do like, and much rather drink their ginseng coffee which is quite good. this is a miss for those that enjoy a mocha taste to their coffee."
4,fine garage rock.,"this cd contains the original stuff: the 1966-1967 cameo parkway recordings. make sure you get this and not the later/older stuff by this band. for a long time these recordings were not available, so i was quite the happy camper when i saw that they were being re-released a couple of years ago. ? and the mysterians are more than just ""96 tears,"" the song that they are known for. there are 25 garage rock songs here that all deserve a listen. this band was something of a flint, michigan version of van morrison's great mid-sixties band ""them."" ? and the mysterians were a bit less biting, a little less menace about their sound, than ""them,"" but otherwise i think the comparison is fair. i much recommend this cd to all seeking some audio travel into the past world of 60's gargage rock."
2,Terrible sound,"I'm a big Question Mark fan, and have both LP's, but, seriously, we waited for this? This is the first legit reissue of ? stuff, and the sound (to me) is terrible! Who mastered this? It sounds like a late-80's-early-90's CD. The other legit Cameo/Parkway CD's I've heard are just as bad. Ultimately, if you don't have this, I guess you have to buy it. Just know that it has sounded better in other packages. Well, hey, given that it's legitimate and the band might actually see some money, please buy it! Question Mark deserves it! Sadly, his house burned down a year or two ago.P.S. this is often described as quintessential ""Farfisa"" garage rock, but, in fact, they primarily place a Vox Continental (and, rumor has it, hate Farfisas)."
5,Come to know them through 96 Tears...,"Detroit... hell, Michigan really, has been known forty plus years now for producing some real raw soul and rock&roll. Until recently, I thought ? Mark and the Mysterians were from L.A. Not, so. Great music, great band. This may be the only ""garage band"" that has lingering plays on the radio. I don't know what to say really. Everyone loves ""96 Tears."" Like the Smashmouth cover of ""I Can't Get Enough of You, Baby""? Check out the original, and then check out some forgotten greats of the era, and the area."
4,Great CD,"Anyone who loves 60's music will consider this CD one of the better finds out there. There is a timeless quality to this stripped down, basic rock 'n roll that music fans of various genres and decades should listen to."
4,NOW FINALLY WE HAVE AN ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF THEIR HITS,THIS IS A SUPER COLLECTION OF SONGS BY THE GROUP OH YES ? MARK AND THE MYSTERIANS FROM CAMEO PARKWAY.WE FINALLY GET TO HEAR ALL THEIR GREAT MUSIC ON ONE DISC. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC YOU WILL LOVE THIS RECORD.!!!ENJOY!!!{ 96 TEARS}
1,Simply A Little Nothing Band From The Sixties,"? Mark And The Mysterians, another sixties garage rock band that failed to gain really any popularity beyond the garage fury of, ""96 Tears"". For 12 bucks your wasting your money when you could just download the only good song on iTunes instead of buying a cd from a band like these guys. The lead singer for this band is kind of insane also i mean he claims he lived with dinosaurs... Yeah not joking. So really do you want to play 12 bucks for one measly song come on?"
5,Very timely shipment and the book was in condition as stated. I will definitely be buying from this person again. Thank you,Very timely shipment and the book was in condition as stated. I will definitely be buying from this person again. Thank you
4,Good book,"A good amount of notes written in many pages, I don't mind too much but other than that it's good."
1,Cost effective?,"First off, X-Files is must-see television, right up through Season 9 if you're a completist or at least curious, and through Season 7 only if you're deeply offended by the last two years (somewhat understandably, it could be argued).But the price of this set is outrageous and the seasons can be had cheaper. However, the X-Files on DVD beats almost any other television show DVD. The extras are thorough and great, the DVDs are easy to navigate, the picture and sound quality fine.So a higher price is understandable."
1,Great Show..but way too Pricey!,"Please go to Ebay and buy each season. I got each of the first seven seasons for only $75.00 each(including shipping). That will save you around $300.00 if you are planning to buy them on this site. Seasons 3,4, and 5 are the best ones to get started with. The Truth is Out There..."
4,WAY TO MUCH MONEY,You can buy seasons 1-7 for under $500.00 or you can buy this one for around $800.00...not much more in the way of extras.
1,Shame on you Fox,"I too must say of all the shows on DVD, X-Files seems to be the most insanely priced. Taking advantage of fans like this is in extremely poor business taste. I'm sure if it were more affordable more people would purchase this amazing show on DVD. Now that TV shows are more popular on DVD, this would be a good time to lower the price (to the giant groan of fans who already purchased them of course, but a necessary evil) and watch them fly off the shelves."
3,Not dishwasher friendly,"This is a great mug. It keeps your coffee warm, is extremely spill resistant, and gives me the 20oz so I only have to make one trip to the coffee pot per day. Downside is it is not dishwasher friendly. I have washed it about 5 times in the dishwasher on the top rack and plastic bottom is now seperating from the steel center. Make sure you stick to hand washing this mug."
5,Awesome,This is a great cup. The lid twists on secure and it has an attached cover for the drinking hole. It can not go in the dish washer. It does keep your drinks cold for quite some time. I make my drink at 8:15 am and I still have ice when i get off at five. I drink water all day at work and I just love this cup. Bonus it fits in your car cup holder. Great buy made of steel and plastic. The inside is plastic only BUT the plastic has no odor and does not have any weird taste. I have went through several cups that were plastic inside and had a funny odor and taste this one is good to go. I have bought several for gifts and everyone loves them.
2,A mug which leaking all the time,"Offcourse this is big and can have 2.5 cups of coffee in it. But is it really worth?I was looking for a bigger coffee cup which can be safely be placed in the cup holder of my van/car without leaking. But this one completely disappointed me on that. It was leaking through out as it's washer was poorly made and always come out of the holder. When it leaks, it really bad and my two shirts lietrally soaked in coffee.Also the bottom is designed to fit in any cup holders, but it poorly designed to balance and the accident of falling down the big one and spilled the coffe all over the place is a common thing these days. another 13$ is goign to be sitting in my garage now."
4,The Medical Assisting Examination Guide,This book is a great addition to my review library for the registerated medical assistant exam.
2,"knife too thin for length, and it's tough to open and close bottle opener","I'm a big Victorinox fan and have owned about 10 other models. I've loved the design of them all. This model is the one exception.For the item I received, the can-opener/bottle-opener combo tool was very difficult to open and close. I actually cut my hand while closing it.Also, in my opinion, the knife is too thin for its length. This makes it difficult and uncomfortable to use. Please consider the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD (Silver Alox) or the Victorinox Swiss Army Cadet (Silver Alox) as alternatives.The Alox Clasic SD is just as thin; but because it is shorter, it is better proportioned. Also, the SD's scissors are very useful. The Cadet is a little thicker, which gives it better proportions. The Cadet is still slim enough though and it comes with more tools. All the tools on these knives where easy enough to open too. Both these tools are close in price to the Bantam too."
5,Minimalist,"The alox Bantam is VERY thin, and provides several functions. In addition to the blade, you have the combo tool, which works as bottle opener, can opener, screwdriver and wire stripper. I can vouch for the combo tool working well as a light-duty prybar, screwdriver, & staple remover. A nice SAK for minimalists, or as a complement to other knives/tools."
4,Peanut Butter makes good JAM,"Infectious grooves and vibrant soundscapes says it all. Peanut Butter Wolf [owner of popular underground label- Stones Throw Records [Madlib, Oh No, Quasimoto, Wildchild, Lootpack, etc]- takes us on a west coast journey through dope mixing, scratching, and rhymes. A must own if you are a fan of ill production, Stones Throw, West Coast underground hip hop, good hip hop in general. Heavily rotated.R.I.P. Charizma."
4,bringing in some more of those beats,"he's sure got the cast, but the beats get boring-i'd rather listen to the beasties"
3,half of this is really great,"Inferno is not a bad album by any means, but my interest in it has worn off just a little bit since my first enthusiatic initial listens. it's hard to shake the sense of thinking there are a few too many Lemmy and Co. on auto pilot moments here...but the sense of dynamics is hightened to reveal some fresh ideas in the Motorhead camp. most notable in ""Keys To The Kingdom"" which has a great groove and is catchy as hell."
5,Greatest band in the world,"Motorhead has been around since 75 and everyone forgets them after Ace of Spades. Ace of Spades isnt even there best record and there work in the 90's and beyond is hundred times better then Ace of Spades. Lemmy is sixty friggin years old! He still rocks harder and better then anyone other front man in the history of music. Im so sick of people putting Lemmy as an after thought, he is the real deal. I mean do you see Lemmy doing a reailty show? Did he lose his voice? no and no! Forgert Ozzy, I know they are good friends but Lemmy is far more talented then Ozzy. This album proves it, and im sure there is much more Motorhead to come. Lemmy doesnt seem to be quiting anytime soon (I hope not)"
5,this band kicks so much butttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt,"wow my first motorhead record. From beginning to end it kicks butt escapcally whorehouse blues. I can't beleve that i didn't get in to this band years ago. This is my type of music fast mean skulling bristering heavy metal, man i thought metallica was fast this is the type of music that we should hear more on the radio not this rap rock crap. pick up the cd you won't be disappoint i can't wait to see them live here in the u.s. take care everyone and rock on"
1,"I REALLY HATE MOTORHEAD!!!!!, THEY ARE TOTAL CRAP!","i really hate motorhead and all of their albums, they are really crap, i bought a greatest hits album of theirs, which came highly reccommended, it was total cr*p also, the albums so called 'great songs' wouldnot even fill the back catalogue of a megadeth, manowar or iced earth, it is terrible, they are really really bad, avoid all of their albums!!, all of them, lemmy is a terribly average bass player, who is THE worst singer in music history, and an insult to metal, this album is really really bad, they deserve no credit or respect!!i would genuinely listen to britney f**kin spears than these old men!."
5,The best Metal/Rock Band in the World,"Compare Motorhead with Metallica since 1991: Metallica had studio albums in 91, 96 (Load and Reload were from the same sessions), 98 (Garage Inc. was old and new), and St. Anger from last year (puke). That's it. Motorhead had studio albums in 91,92,93,95,96,98,00,02,and 04. They also had a great live album in 99. Each one of those albums rock - better than anything else out there. It's a CRIME that this band doesn't get the respect it deserves. Inferno is their all time best work. And I know my Motorhead - all the way back to 1975.Go do yourself a favor and ""discover"" this band. Take your time. Then one day it will hit you like a ton of bricks. You'll say to yourself: ""These guys really are the best! Nobody can out play them."" Lemmy will tell you why: It's because Motorhead is a blues band. Without the blues, hard rock is flavorless. Motorhead has the hardest flavor of anyone."
3,Pretty good.,"Another Motorhead CD. I will admit there isn't anything special or original about this CD, but it's still a good CD worth entering into any metal collection."
5,Motorhead's Best,"I own all of Motorhead's albums and have seen them live every other year or so since the early 80's. Taking nothing away from any of their other albums, this is #1. The riffs are fast and furious, the bass and drums are driving and heavy. Consistent, pounding, head banging metal. I'm not much of detailed review writer, I just really dig the album. Rock on."
3,"3,5 stars",This album has 4 really good songs and the other songs are bad. The good songs are (Terminal show - Killers - In the name of tragedy - Whorehouse blues). If you are a huge fan then buy this album for this really good tracks . The other tracks are simply bad.
5,Great,"Been wanting this cd for a very long, long, long, long time and finally found it with all the greatest hits I wanted!"
4,24 Tunes - Here's the List,"Track list:1. Dancin' Party2. The Twist3. Toot4. The Class5. Twistin' USA6. The Hucklebuck7. Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On8. Pony Time9. Dance the Mess Around10. Good, Good Lovin'11. Let's Twist Again12. The Fly13. Slow Twistin'14. Popeye the Hitchhiker15. Limbo Rock16. Let's Limbo Some More17. Hooka Tooka18. Loddy Lo19. Hey, Bobba Needle20. Birdland21. Surf Party22. Twist It Up23. Twistin' Round the World24. Jingle Bell RockTwo of these did not chart on the Billboard Top Pop Singles (Toot and Twistin' Round the World).Chubby Checker had 26 tunes that did chart from 1959 through 1963."
3,"Love the Songs, Hate The CD (Technically)","I have bought over 500 CDs in my audio collecting ""career"". A while back I bought 4 ABKCO CDs from AMAZON.COM:(1) Very Best of Bobby Rydell(2) Very Best of Chubby Checker(3) Very Best of The Orlons(4) Very Best of Dee Dee SharpI have had virtually NO trouble with any of my 500+ CDs EXCEPT # (1) and #(2) above.The last 5 or 6 tracks on BOTH CDs do not play but just skip around playing garbage.It seems strange that my two problem CDs, out of500+, come from ABKCO.By the way .... over the last 2 months I haveripped over 600 cuts from many many CDs intomy jukebox (my computer). No problems.Except ... again, guess which two CDs ??"
4,It's a shame this doesn't include all his top 40 hits...,"After waiting 20 years for Chubby Checker's original cameo-parkway hits to appear on cd, why did they have to leave off three of this top 40 hits? Too bad. I guess I STILL have to keep my old vinyl copies of the three missing songs: ""Twenty Miles"", ""Lazy Elsie Molly"", and ""Let's Do the Freddie"".I would have rather had these than tracks that weren't hits (like ""Toot"" whose background music sounds like ""Short Shorts"" by the Royal Teens""."
4,Great Fun,"Yes, this book in written in an antiquated style (based on that of Edgar Allan Poe). That is one of the book's chief charms! The book is a real page-turner that will satisfy readers who are adventurous enough to go with the engaging rhythm of Poe's voice, which in Schechter's hands is pitch perfect. The less adventurous might be advised to stick with Grisham et al. When I think of that hapless fate, I am filled with the most awful, the most dreadful foreboding..."
3,An excellent summer read,"Hey, it's a mystery novel not a work of art. It has a nice mystery, some really weird scenes with Houdini, some very funny bits and a lot of great adventure. This book kept me entertained very much when it first hit the streets. I'd love to see this made into a movie. Get this book. If you want a masterpiece read War and Peace. If you want a nice light book that is fun to read, get this one."
2,This wasn't a comedy? This wasn't a parody?,"I was surprised to realize that this book wasn't a comedy. I was laughing happily at the ridiculous prose (crafted to imitate Poe's writing style) and the clever, over-the-top parodies of both Crockett's and Poe's characters. But as I read on, I realized that the novel possibly wasn't intended to be funny. Did I misunderstand? I came to Amazon.Com to find out. Well. Here I found it. It's supposed to be a deadly serious book. None of the reviewers, neither professional nor readers like myself, describe the book as a parody. (Or even acknowledge the parody.) As I read on, I found myself less and less willing to put up with the author's style. Unable to trust it as humor, it's simply a tedious book. I didn't finish it."
3,"Well, I'll be!!","I could not stop imagining Johnny Depp and John Wayne cast as the main characters in this book! It was awesome to me, but as a native of San Antonio, my opinion is biased. I am also a fan of Poe and enjoyed the made-up recounts of the ""fall of the house of Asher!"" Read it, if you dare!"
5,a pleasure to read,"I recently read Harold Schechter""s novel ""Nevermore"", and was pleasantly surprised. I actually picked the book off of the bargain table not having heard anything about the author or the book. However, my interest in Edgar Allan Poe's works prompted me to buy it. I thoroughly enjoyed being transported to 1830's Baltimore, a city I have spent some time in. Mr.Schechter nearly convinced me that I was reading one of Poe's actual works. I could actually feel the dark oppresive atmosphere of the setting. I have always enjoyed reading the prose of the nineteenth century American writers, and Schechter seems to have an exceptional talent in this arena. I did have to use a dictionary to enable myself to be transported into the story, but what a ride, and what a learning experience as well. It is a shame that this type of writing is no longer popular."
4,Not quite Poe-fect,"The best part of this story, to me, was the use of the unreliable narrator, Poe himself, to tell this story. Every time he mentions that it is not jealousy that drove his emotions or that he rarely imbibes is a classic scenario in which (just as in ""The Cask of Amontillado"", ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", etc.) we know that the person telling the story is skewing it towards his point of view. That, and the high-falutin' language should surely cause the reader to chuckle. The fact that Davy Crockett is not only a self-promoting egoist who, in fact, possesses all of the powers that he claims to have, just adds to the humor. Sometimes the language bogs down the reader, but in general it adds to the contrast between the two disparate ""heroes"". The only fault I have is the end. The culprit is too contrived for my taste. On a personal side note, I liked the fall of the house of ""Asher""."
3,"Suspense or ""Abbott & Costello""?","In truth, I really liked this book. However, I had trouble telling if it was supposed to be a thriller or ""Lethal Weapon"" rip-off. I enjoyed the unusual pairing of Edgar Allen Poe and Davy Crockett, particularly the differing speech dialects, but the story simply isn't meant to be a comedy. Isn't it supposed to be about a serial murderer? While I found the book enjoyable, it lacked the depth of more quality works (e.g. Caleb Carr). Not a bad book, but not great either."
2,italics?,"clever idea and plot, but wading through Poe's narration is as grim as the murder scenes, despite the historically accurate voice."
2,annoying,"I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter seemed excellent. However, several things really started to bother me greatly. First of all, Poe comes across as a really pedantic prig. His conversational language is absurd: it is not as if the real Poe wrote or spoke that way so I don't know why the author has him speak in such a pedantic, convoluted style. Another annoyance is the constant use of italics for emphasis at least 4 or 5 times a page. It is so very unnecessary. And thirdly is the ridiculous way Davy Crocket speaks. I don't care if he was a showboater, no one speaks that way. The plot is an interesting one but the denoument is far fetched and unrealistic. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."
5,a great historical fiction,loved this book. Read it sometime ago but the author did a great job. Loved it
4,The reviews of this are all over the place........,"...well, it IS a parody, and a dark comedy. The fine true-crime writer tried a novel, and I, for one, liked it. Yes Poe and Davy Crockett were real. So were Maria and Virginia Clemm. So were Poe's theatrical parents...Mrs. Poe's grave is at St. John's Church in Richmond, Va, and David Poe really did abandon his family. John Allan was a jerk, though not as big a one as described here. Yes, Davy wrote a book in 1834 [in print; available on Amazon], and yes, Poe gave it a bad review...he was noted for really caustic reviews. The rest........is a STORY, a work of fiction, written in a pretty good parody of Poe's style, and incorporating elements of a fair amount of Poe's work. If you're looking for a profound literary masterpiece, or for history, forget it. Try Poe. But if you're looking for harmless entertainment, hung on a historical framework, try it...you might just like it. Quoth the raven......"
2,Poe and Crockett...why?,"The reviewer from Bogart, GA hit the nail on the head. By writing as Poe, Schechter was able to create the illusion of Poe telling this ""true"" tale. The problem is Poe's prose is deadly dull. With a delicate sensibility, ""Poe's"" narration avoids any mentions of things to horrible to convey to the gentle readers, leading the reader to fill in all the blanks. This technique starts as quaint, but rapidly becomes irksome .The mystery is far fetched, but it is clever in the way it references Poe's work. Crockett's appearence as the frontier hero image he created for himself was a bit larger than life as was Poe's fainting at every horror. The portrayal of Poe's relationship to his cousin and future bride was appropriately creepy, but this occasional glimpse at the ""real"" Poe was buried amidst the dated Poe first person dialogue. A good idea, buried under literary pretensions."
2,I tried to make it to the end,"I really did try to finish reading this book -- Honest I did! -- but I just couldn't.In the beginning, the idea of a full length novel written in Poe-esque style was interesting. Then, when that style was combined with an authentic backwoods Kentucky dialect for Davy Crockett, it was a novelty. After 150 pages it was no longer interesting nor novel, it was just painful. Buried underneath all of this ""highfalutin"" writing is, I think, a very good story, but I just didn't have the fortitude to dig deep enough to find it.I have no doubt in my mind that this novel was meticulously researched. I have no doubt that the writing and speaking styles correctly and accurately represent both Poe and Crockett. I have no doubt that the historical settings are correct and representative of the time period. I do, however, have serious doubts about the readability and enjoyment of this book."
5,don't know what it is.,"these are by far my favorite vitamins. i was turned onto them when i was pregnant & i took the prenatal ones. they don't upset my stomach, they are easy to swallow, they clear up my skin, & give me energy."
2,Non-traditional,"These illustrations do not conform to Dover's usual brilliant interpretation of great art into a coloring book format. I have been loving Dover coloring books since my first copy of ""Ancient Greece"" which I shared with my mom when I was two. I was looking for an alternative to Disney fairies for my four-year-old, but these illustrations have neither the charm of Margaret W. Tarrant nor the simplicity of Dover's usual interpretations. The illustrations have a Gothic quality and the faces leave too little to the imagination."
2,Not Quite,"I should've looked at the pictures posted that show what's inside the book before purchasing it. I bought it for therapudic reasons. I needed inspirational/pleasant pics to color and got ugly trolls instead. That was my mistake, granted. But Idk, some of those pics are perverse. I'm 18, but it's a children's coloring book... shouldn't it be cleaner? Maybe a little more pleasant? I haven't gone coloring book shopping... ever, so maybe I'm missing it, but... besides that though, i enjoyed the captions beneath the pictures that describe the creatures."
4,Coloring Book,"I bought this as a gift and had it mailed to her. I do not know how well she liked it, but I have not heard any complaints."
5,Great coloring book,"When I watch tv, I enjoy coloring. The pictures in this book are great. I use colored pencils as it's easier to ""stay in the lines."" I wouldn't recommend this for young children."
5,"The ""Cool"" coloring book...","I have to say, of all the coloring books I purchased for a 2-3 year old this was the one most loved by the adults. The child was happy with all of them, Disney, animals, butterflies, and this in an equal manner... but the grown ups thought this was wonderful. If you have a child who likes fantasy themes, or a teenager who happens to enjoy coloring, or even if you just like coloring books this one is definately a must."
4,Awesome.,"I'm a great admirer of odd music, and seek it out as often as possible, and if you describe yourself in similar terms, you must definitely buy this CD.It's worth the price alone for the songs ""Yamasuki"" and ""Abana Bakana."" ""Yamasuki"" has to be the weirdest song I've ever heard. While what sounds like Japanese schoolkids sing beautifully, a karate dude screeches in the background like he's killing multiple enemies. Bizarre. ""Abana Bakana"" sounds like nothing else on the album, but it's alive with energy.Inside the CD's booklet, this album is called ""educational-bubblegum-multi-cultural-psycho-rock-opera,"" but I'd just call it an offbeat gem.My gratitude is extended to Finders Keepers for reissuing this."
5,an authoritative and essential reference for all .NET developers,"Excerpt from C# Online.NET Review (wiki.CSharp-Online.NET):""This book is the authoritative reference to the .NET Framework libraries: Networking Library, Reflection Library, and XML Library. Each type has its own chapter with the following features:- Header - namespace name, type name, library name.- Type summary - C# declaration syntax for all members.- Type description - detailed usage description.- Annotations - annotations by key Microsoft design team members including Anders Hejlsberg.- Example - C# source code and program output."""
1,Typical Misinformed attempt,"A very misinformed attempt to treat the subject of contradiction between science and religion-according-to-the-vedas. Inconsistent arguments and incoherent use of logic and reason, I would only recommend this book as a negative demonstrative tool. It is very useful in that respect as it contains many of the typical flaws found in poor rhetoric and critical thinking."
5,LOVE!,"I LOVE this scent, it mixes with my body chemistry perfectly. People are always asking me what I'm wearing and it makes my boyfriend go nuts. It's a great scent just on it's own too. Best idea would be to try it on in a department store then see if you like it."
5,Beautiful Scent!,"I couldn't wait to try Euphoria. Its a subtle scent and when I wear it people ask what I am wearing. Its also one of my husband's new favoritesso I will be sure to use it often. Of course anything by Calvin Klein has got to be good! I also like the modern shape of the perfume bottle.S.B. Nelson, Canyon, Mn."
2,Not a fan of this one,"I actually really like Euphoria for Men so I was excited to try the Women's version. It smells very sweet in the bottle, and when I put it on, it was very strong. So strong, in fact, that it gave me a headache. I had to go take a shower because I could still smell it after I tried washing it off of my wrists in the sink. If you like the super powerful, knock you over kind of scents, then maybe one will like this one, but I personally would not recommend it."
4,"Great mugs for hot mulled wine, cider, or hot chocolate/expresso",These seem of high quality and look adorable for entertaining! Love them!So glad I decided to buy these instead of some more expensive glasses!
1,USA Product,"After searching the retail market for these mugs and unable to find, I was happy to find this American product at Amazon. All of the mugs arrived unbroken."
1,"Bad sound, worse picture. Don't buy it!","The picture quality is awful, unwatchable. Hissing sound all the time. There is good options, like Robert Youngston's ""The First Kings of Comedy"", a two hours compilation of silents: Laurel & Hardy, Keystone Kops, Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon and many others."
3,Unrestored silent comedies.,"Maybe not restored, but still classics.Air Pockets (1924): A wacky inventor tries to recruit investors for his folding flivver - the world's first compact car. Starring Lige Conley, Earl Montgomery, Sunshine Hart and Olive Borden; Directed by Fred Hibbard.Don't Butt In! (1926): A laborer must defeat a huge, dim-witted bully in order to win the hand of the boss's pretty daughter. Starring Paul Parrott, Ethel Broadhurst and Sunshine Sammy; Produced by Hal Roach; Directed by Raymond Grey.Grab the Ghost (1920): Newlyweds are shocked to discover that their honeymoon home is haunted by ghosts. Starring Snub Pollard and Marie Mosquini; Produced by Hal Roach; Directed by Alf Goulding.The Daredevil (1923): A movie director plucks reluctant Joe Magee from the rodeo, intent on turning him into his next cowboy star. Starring Ben Turpin, Kewpie Morgan and Madeline Hurlock; Directed by Del Lord."
5,Entertaining and challenging.,"My 4year old loved this game right away and so far she has only completed level one.(kept her interested for hours) Lots of variety. Style of the game is similar to ""Freddi Fish and the stollen conch shell."""
4,Grandson loves it.,We have had this game for about a month. My grandson (age 5) is here a couple days a week and plays it each time he stays. We have several computer games but I would have to say this is one of his favorites.
3,Lucky Dirty Old Man,Maybe I'm not in the mainstream of the sexual revolution but the plot I would consider a little far fetched.
2,"Mildy interesting, intensely depressing","Life is short, you never know when your time will come, yes we know. Kapesh is an old arrogant academic trying to recapture the sexual passion of youth, clinging to this beautiful young girl. This tale may have been better left as a book, not a movie. It's a trite story, we see so often of the older man falling for the much younger girl. So this time it's she who dies. So sad, too true. Nothing wrong with the acting, just a boring tale of the usual sadnesses of life."
1,Self-indulgent and mysoginist,"Bottom line: Phillip Roth, the author of the novella on which this film is based, hates women and is really angry about growing old, and it shows. This film completely fetishizes beauty and fetishizes women. In Roth's story, Kepesh (Kingsley) gets his ""revenge"" for growing old by castrating the girl: she has to lose a breast. The film is lush, certainly; Kingsley is studly and Cruz is beautiful and pliant like a Barbie doll, but this film convinces me of nothing--absolutely nothing--other than the fact that an old man's attempt to remain virile is dependent upon the disfigurement of the woman. I can't believe that they made this story into a film; oh, wait: yes, I can. It's Hollywood."
2,Pathetic!,The story and the characters are pathetic but if you're an aging egocentric misogynist this is the perfect movie for you.
3,a love story,"An older successful man has a affair with his beautiful student.Unlike his previous history this student is differentand he becomes attached.The movie moves slowly and has some pretty explicit love scenesand nudity.Ben Kingsley's acting is very expressive,but the theme of older men and younger womenis probably not one most young people would find very interesting.The only redeeming feature is that the movie ends witha good result."
2,I thought it would never end!,"This was a pretty trite movie masquerading as a ""heavy"" story. It was that old theme of an older man who still thinks he deserves a younger woman. He finally got some sense when he saw how pathetic he would look if he showed up as her ""boyfriend.""Another review said that it was a story of love overcoming the loss of physical beauty. When exactly did she lose that beauty? She was going to lose a breast, so she would no longer be beautiful? It just didn't make sense--especially with someone who looks like Penelope Cruz. I think it was a pretty heavy dose of what is not important in the world and in relationships.Then there is the whole other issue of the father/son relationship that went nowhere."
1,INANE SELFISHNESS,"This movie was dreadful, as it was inane, boring, and meaningless. It shows no virtue or value for life. I would wonder how any one could like this movie.Ben's character was a narcissistic liar. Curz's character was mindless. The character development was awful.Who were these people, and did you even care about them?Ben's character spends a lot of time feeling sorry for himself. I got bored looking at Cruz's breasts. We were laughing and groaning through this movie.How awful. Thankfully my best friend, who I am married to for twenty five years, felt the same way about this movie."
2,too nice and too weak,"Penelope Cruz's character is too accommodating to Ben Kingsley's character even though he is rude. She wasn't made to look beautiful at all. Her makeup was disturbing, her eyebrows overarched and she did not look like an ingenue. What was disturbing is that at the end of the movie, this is all the emotional content that these two characters have managed to accumulate in their lives."
4,"Good movie, some reviewers seem to have Rorschach ""issues""","I was surprised how much I liked this film.Good character portraits, though there seemed to be more insight WRT him than her. The movie was really about him, I think.The way the story played out caused something to get stuck in my eye a few times, if you know what I mean.No heroes or villains in this one, everyone's a human. Love and loss. Passage of time. Growing up. Learning to *give* love freely, and to accept loss.Also, this movie really hammers home my opinion of Penelope Cruz: what an incredibly intelligent, beautiful, elegant woman she is! She farts Dao, and misogyny accusers are too educated-stupid to smell it!"
3,Don't grow old Grow up,"Based on the book`The Dying Animal' by Philip Roth. Ben Kingsley is David Kepesh an aging professor who is free of any romantic and family connections. He is a college professor and is supposedly a cultural authority on what should be read and heard. He has had many relationships until Consuela, the daughter of Cuban immigrants stirs up his romantic interest. Patricia Clarkson is his part time lover and Dennis Hopper plays his confidante and friend. The film's main theme is about the decisions we make and confronting aging and death. Kingley's relationship with his son is mature and cold hearted at the same time. Penelope Cruz and Kingsley display some chemistry and emotion. The music is beautiful, and some of the pieces warrant a second hearing on CD. The scenes at the end are touching and brilliantly acted. However it failed to move me and so did the rest of the movie. I enjoyed the acting and would give it 3 stars. 1/15/10"
5,A beautiful gift for that someone special in your life.,"This was a gift to my wife. She was immediately impressed with the amazing detail of the piece, and was even more amazed when she realized the bell actually rang with a pleasant tone. Unlike the cheap ""bell"" jewelry you can buy in the department stores, this little bear tinkles like a real bell. My wife has used it as a pendant, but now has it hanging from her rear-view mirror for good luck. She loves it."
4,Great companion to lectures.,"The most important thing to keep in mind would be the intended audience of this book. Specifically, the concepts outlined in this text should complement the content provided by a legitimate math instructors. If I were to use this book to self-teach or something of the sorts, I'm sure I would hate this book as well. Although the examples are sometimes unclear, the summaries of techniques are the most helpful parts in the book. At the end of a section, a blue box outlining the fundamental steps in a process reveals the simplest way to approach any problem. For example, this text's summary of Variation of Parameters pretty much sums up everything about that process in a clear and concise way.Anyways, it's not as if you have any other choice when the instructor assigns this text as a required material. If looking for a self-teach sort of book, this text is not that great. But if you're looking for a review of ODEs and whatnot, I would recommend this book."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book for a Differentiation Equation course. That is the reason I bought this book. However, there is a new version of this book out. My professor actually wanted that book, but its pretty much the same thing I believe; accept the new version has more problems to solve."
3,Differential Equations Textbook,"The book came more used than I was expecting - writing on several pages, slightly worn cover/edges. However, the book was by no means unusable and has done its job so far."
5,Everything Great.,"I ordered the wrong book. However, the book was like new and the seller gladly bought the book back from me."
3,Michelle Kwan: Quest for Gold,"I ordered this book for my daughter in 5th grade. She is a fan of Ms. Kwan's and needed to write a biography for school. Although it is a nice book, it really isn't what I thought. It is only 60 pages and mostly pictures, very little real content. If you just want a fan book this will work, but it really isn't a biography for grades 4 to 6 as represented."
2,Just too big!!,These are so big and heavy. The clips you hook together to make it spring back to an open position don't stay together so you are constantly trying to re-hook them.Would not recommend these.
2,"Barely clips, more of a bend and tear",This is absolutely the worst clipper! It BARELY clips the nail - it's more of a bend/indent/tear/cut sort of...Maybe I got a dud?
1,These are horrible.,"I got these and tried them. I would be better off trying to do my hands with a spoon! these do not cut, pull maybe, no cut! dont buy!"
4,Pretty nice,"They get the job done, pretty cheap also, no rubber grip and the hinge is a little loose but it is a good tool."
1,Really dull..,"I bought this to replace my 4years old one. However, this one is worse then my old nipper...It's really dull and not really clipping my cuticle.I regret buying this."
4,Refreshingly different,"I believe the story line was original and quite different than the other books dealing with this subject matter. In the very beginning it was stated that entertainment was all that was promised. Aside from publishing errors the message line was very clear to me. Everyone seeks absolution in one form or another here is an example of where our God given choice to escape our mortal bounds and view our souls as something much more than just abstract thought. The author, I believe is only trying to let the reader imagine spiritualy what religious dogmas have already done, only with a what if ..twist. Thanks. I get it. Good read."
1,You all must have read a different book,"I have a feeling either the author or his publisher wrote the above reviews. I'm sure Mr. Miranda is a good writer, but this book read like someone just printed the first draft of the manuscript. The title is even grammatically incorrect. The storyline makes little sense and leaves the reader thoroughly confused.PLEASE take it from me... Or don't. It's your $20."
5,This stuff is what I have been looking for!,"This face wash is GREAT! As the other reviews have said, this leaves your face feeling fresh, clean, yet soft and not dry in the least. You dont need to use much to get the job done either. A small dollop does it. I know this is not billed as a ""acne fighting face wash"", but I have used proactiv, clean and clear (various sensitive skin acne regimens), and skinID among others to combat my mild, yet still annoying case of acne, and so far(about a month) this has kept me in the clear. If you have tried everything else, give this stuff a shot. It works great."
4,Get Past Citrus Smell And This Product Will Amaze You,"The original Anthony Logistic's foaming facial cleanser was featured as the 2010 Men's Best Grooming Awards in the face wash category by Esquire. I figured that the Anthony Sport foaming facial cleanser would NOT be too far off from the original Anthony Logistic line. I am glad I gave this a shot. It has a strong hint of citrus when you first wash with it, but goes away after a while so no worries. Only a tiny amount needs be used (less than dime size). My face felt so clean and soft after the wash. It did not dry my face either. This is the product I have looked for all along."
4,Great ideas/pictures but a bit confusing to younger kids..,"I really like this book -- it has some GREAT ideas and my 5 year old son (he has a twin sister) likes me to read it to him.. the only problem is there is so much on one page, it's set up sort of like a comic strip with individual ""bubbles"" for thoughts/words coming from each character so I have to constantly point to who is saying what, which can cause some of the meaning to be lost on a younger child. There is also a lot packed onto each page that is very distracting so I try to fold the book or cover parts of it with my hands so my son can concentrate on each individual part. But all in all, I am happy with it, if only that it creates a storyline for me to follow to explain to my son how to make friends. Book is probably geared more towards 6-7 year olds."
5,Wonderful,"Beautiful knowledge for the tykes, laid out in an entertaining and accessible way. My daughter asked me to read it three times in a row."
1,Too Late To Return,"I would return this book but it is too late. Here's what I didn't like. In giving examples of what not to do they give examples that use words kids find funny like ""Stupidosaurus"" that can plant ideas of bad behavior. At a very early age kids can't differentiate between good and bad examples. My 4 year old grandkids would never use the word bored but this book uses it and now they want to know what bored is. There is an example of a boy running after a girl and the girl saying ""he's my boyfriend."" It's not even used as a bad example. Don't want my kids thinking that it's OK for boys to chase you if you don't want them too. Although there are good examples the bad ones make this book dissappointing (there are many others) and not a good way to teach about friendship."
5,How to be a Friend,This book is full of wonderful messages. My daughter is 7 years old and is perfect for her to read. She enjoyed discussing what was happening in the book and could relate with the story and what was happening. I will pull this book out often to help her remember all the different aspects of being a good friend; this book covers all of them!
3,Not easy to read aloud,"This book was purchased for a preschooler. The illustrations are cute and colorful. The text is a list of tips rather than a cohesive storyline. On a single page, multiple tips and scenarios are presented with cartoon bubbles from the mouths of the different characters. This makes this book hard to read aloud, since it breaks up the reading. Also, lots of content is packed in, rather than just a few central ideas that are tightly reinforced. I would not recommend this book for non-readers. It may be better for a 7-8 year old who could read the story by herself."
4,Definitely worth the read,This covered many aspects of being friends and was great for my 1st grade son. It even covered what bullies are and gave ideas on how to respond to them.
2,Only good for whiting out the tiniest print,"I am taken aback by these rave reviews which encouraged me to order this because my experience with it has been different.Maybe I didn't read the description closely enough and missed something, but I just used this today to correct a form, and was shocked to find out how ultra thin the pen tip is -- way too thin to effectively cover anything except maybe punctuation, and the coverage wasn't that good either."
3,Too short for the subject and time period covered,"Not a bad book, but it tries to cover too large a subject in too few pages, without benefit of diagrams and not very many photos. Really only recommended for history newbies."
5,Great deal,"I purchased this bundle of seasons, and have no regret. Being a recent fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this offers me the chance to view all 4 seasons in one swoop. It's also a very good price to pay. You can't go wrong with this deal. I recommend these seasons to any Buffy fan - New or old, or even if you have the slightest interest in the show. This is your chance to actually grab ahold of these seasons, and watch one after another, without having to wait for a TV program to play it for you!You can't go wrong with this deal. 5 Stars!"
5,Great price,This is a great price compared to buying one at a time. Don't forget that Season 5 is currently available and 6 comes out this summer. Then we get to wait for the final season 7.
1,Buyer beware,"This collection just a couple of days ago was selling for less than $160. Today it's over $180? The four seasons individually add up to $176.03 on Amazon, and $161.92 at Buy.com. All offer free shipping."
5,in addition to Maz,first off Buffy is my favorite TV show of all time. i hope everyone will enjoy the joy/laughter/drama of Buffy & the Scoopies. be careful with the price of the packaged seasons 1-4. its actually cheaper to by all 4 seasons individually at $164.96!
1,"What's Good is Good, But What's Awful...Well...","Buyer beware. I purchased this box set for its value and convenience. The complete first four seasons of Buffy in one shot? What a great deal, right? However, right in the middle of Season 3, when Faith is on the run and the Mayor is gearing up for his big day, I put in disc 5 from the season, and suddenly, I've got a menu for episodes from Season 5!!!! That's not even part of the set!!!! What is up with this? I have just written to amazon.com requesting exchange/refund information, but what a downer! This is a major glitch and probably not limited to just my disc."
1,The question is not whether Buffy is worth buying...,...of course it is! the question is whether you should buy THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE. add up the individual seasons and you'll see that they're not even giving you a deal here. it costs basically the same as if you were to buy the seasons separately. that's hardly worth it.
5,You can't go wrong with this!!,"This DVD set is a terrific way to start a Buffy Collection. Anyone who wants to own the DVDs and has fallen way behind, this is a terrific deal. It's exactly the same as buying all four seasons seperately only you get them all for one great price. The DVDs contain loads of special features including interviews with Joss Whedon (the creator), James Marsters (Spike), and other cast members, writers, and directors.If you've never experienced Buffy and are thinking to yourself, ""Why would I buy four seasons of a television show I've never seen?"" I recommend renting the first season from either your local video store or from Netflix. After seeing the first season, chances are you will become addicted and want the rest, then you can make the purchase.Hopefully they will release a similar offer for the Angel series after the third season is out, that way people can benefit from that a similar offer."
1,disc screw up in season 3,"I bought this set, each season packaged seperately, and am on disc 5 of the third season. However, this disc doesn't contain episodes from that season. It is from season five!!! How can I get the right disc?"
3,un-original,"After hearing the songs abk had on from outer space 2 like the song warrior I was really anticipating his new cd. But now after listening to it a couple times I hate to say it liks ballz. For starters there are really no stand out tracks and all of his songs are so predictable, This was a big let down as I know abk can write great songz hopefully next album he puts it on there.............."
5,Put my life on it.,"This was the last cd I needed to fill my ABK collection. I'm glad I got it. Plus, the shirt I have came from this cd, so another reason to get this album. Whoop whoop!"
4,the killa strikes again,"I think abk is one of the best rappers to perform under psychopathic records. He is one of the rappers that is not reconized too well either If you listen to him you should know how good his music is He raps about his native american heritage which is something anybody should do This cd is not as good as hatchet warrior but it still has alot of good songs Some of the best songs on the cd are bombs on you which is a great intro song, stick and move, down here, party at the liquor store,hey yall which you can buy as a single, retaliate featuring twiztid, nevehoe feat shaggy, it doesnt matta feat colton grundy, and laugh at you. I usually stick to listening to icp and twiztid but when i first listened to this i was like holy f*ck this sh*t is awesom so if your a juggalo you should definetly buy this and belive me you wont regret it. MCL"
5,good cd,"if u like icp or twiztid this is the band to buy this band is one of the less known in pshycopathic records but hey, it's a cd worth buying if ur a juggalo"
2,D12 and the Dixie Chicks?,"What the hell was your about. I must have bought a different copy than you because mine doesnt have Eminem on it. What the FXCK are you on. I also didnt know ABK toured with the Chixie Dicks. What the hell world are you living in? O.k. First off I love ABK's first album but he lost me here. The only songs i can really listen to are ""party at the liquor store"" and ""charlie brown"". I say DL it first. If you like it buy it. If not, pitch it. MCL"
2,A barely adequate NFL collection,"When one thinks of football, one thinks of great plays, impossible touchdowns, incredible turnovers, and the sort. One thinks of the great love of the game, and of cheering on the home team to the bitter end. However, this gift set never reminds of the like, or of such emotions. This set offers nothing new, with bad cinematography and even worse scripting. Many of the NFL's greatest moments are simply ignored in this disaster of a gift set. These films just simply seem tacked on. Unless you are one who must have everything pro football, stay the whole nine yards away from this unrecovered fumble."
4,"Good Action, Quality Actors",Luke Goss knows how to carry a film. In all his films he puts his whole persona into it. 50cent has the BA qualities you need and Val Kilmer well he is just all around interesting! I really liked what I have seen so far and can not wait to get this into my DVD collection! Thanks Luke for making great films!
1,trash,why is 50cent even on the cover he is only in the movie for like 5 minutes.i guess thay needed a famous face to sell the lies
3,"So, So movie","Entertaining, but not memorable. I should have rented it first and saved some money. A 'B' movie at best. Save your money."
5,Cool,"Got here promptly as estimated and as described in the product detail. Thanks, I am very satisfied with my purchase!"
2,Boring,Bought this a part of a special deal. Boring C-grade. The only good perfomance is by Lucke Goss. Save your cash.
1,bad hero,"The Velvet Promise is the worst book I had ever read. I hate the hero with a passion and couldn't believe that the heroine want to stay with him. I feel that he was too dumb and I feel sorry for the heroine. I think she should of end up with a better man and he should of end up with his crazy mistress. Even at the end of the book I still feel that his love for Alice is greater than anything he feels for Judith. He done nothing but protect Alice and show only kindness toward her while he treated Judith like his property. He is no hero to me and there was no love between him and his wife, Judith but sex. This is the third book I had read from Jude Deveraux and I think it will be the last because if all her heroes are like this than I am better off reading some other author."
3,This is a good one.,"I liked this book and the characters, excluding Alice. Judith was smart, funny, and beautiful. Gavin did not deserve her though. I did not like his harsh ways of dealing with her. Everything she says to him, he takes it the wrong way and uses it against her. He even believes Walter's word over hers. I liked Stephan, Raine and Miles much better. They all liked her for who she was and not for what they wanted her to be. She would have been better off with one of them."
1,Really???,"I don't understand the good reviews I read about this book. I bought it because Jude Deveraux has never let me down, but I must say this was the first book I have ever thrown across the room. I am sorry but the fact of having the hero of the novel first slap and then rape the heroine on their wedding day are not what I call my ""taste"". Some may argue that at the time that the book takes place such things were common but I couldn't read past it."
1,Marital rape is not good romance novel material,"I thought the premise of this novel was interesting: The husband is in love with another woman who is using him, but he marries for money, to a woman who is forced into the marriage by her abusive father. It's not your typical premise.However, I got as far as the scene where the husband rapes his wife on their wedding night, started to cry, and closed the book. Intimate partner rape is a real life issue that devastates people's lives, not a technique of erotica."
3,nostalgic series,"When I first started reading romance novels, this series was one of my favorites. Possibly, it was also a forerunner for series about brothers.Strangely, the first is the one I liked the least because, to this day, I can remember wanting to give the hero a swift kick."
3,Gavin's an oaf,"but I really liked the heroine. It wasn't the best of Deveraux's books, but it's an easy read."
1,Velvet Promise,"I really didn't like this book. I like more romance in my romance novels. I was shocked at the violence in it. ...suicide, abortion, the only thing missing was incest! Other people really liked it so maybe it's just me."
1,This book was beyond BAD!!! It was violent and depressing.,"Where to begin... I love Jude Deveraux, I think her stories are wronderful and I always grow to love her characters. There are always exeptions though, And The Velvet Promise was a depressing, violent tale which actually made me throw the book accross the room after I finished it-This was how angry I was. I LOATHED the hero, Gavin, with a passion. Judith, dear, you are a doormat. I am suprised that she put up with some of the stuff Gavin dished out. Since when is rape a marital right? Someone answer that please? And it is called family loyality, Gavin you should really try it. If you want a read that will make you want to scream with fustration then this is the book for you."
4,Velvet Series Part 1 - Gavin and Judith's Story,"This is Gavin and Judith's story, the first in the Velvet series. Gavin is the eldest of the 4 Montgomery brothers and he is in love with the beautiful but cold Alice, his mistress. However, she will not marry him because she wants wealth beyond his means. She becomes betrothed to Chatworth. Losing all hope of marrying his beloved Alice, he agrees to marry wealthy heiress, Judith. A marriage of convenience. Will Judith's love for him and loyalty to him break his obsession for Alice.Judith is a worthy heroine. And it was fun to read her seduction of Gavin. There is an softness and innocence about their love for each other. However, my heart went out to Judith for her lost towards the end of the book. Get out the hankies! A great read, a worthy JD classic!Lealing"
1,Rape apparently is okay....,"Wow, on her wedding day her husband slaps her and knocks her to the ground after vowing to punish her father for doing the same thing?!Then on her wedding night he RAPES her and 10 minutes later she forgives him and wants to have sex again?In what world is this okay especially for a romance novel.To the people that positively reviewed this book explain how there ever is a justification for rape or abuse, despite the time period, as some suggest, as this is ROMANCE novel not a factual historical account.I bought another of Jude's novels and actually enjoyed that one, but after reading her ridiculous account of rape, abuse and lies by her husband, this book is terrible.There are many romance books featuring awesome, strong sexy highlanders, Karen Marie Morning to name one, that NEVER resorts to violence against women but keeps the historical time period perfectly in place."
3,Only because its Jude,"I have to admit this was the least favorite book of the series. Gavin was a real jerk to Judith, especially on their wedding night. He was totally selfish.His brothers where by far more caring than he. Judith was strong even though she was young. He was wild with grief, hatred, and revenge. It took away from the book for me. I wanted him to pay even at the end - well just a little because she tamed him.With all that said, this book was a good read because you got a glimpse of the next spectacular books of the series leading men. I recommend highly all the books of this series and even this one so that you know how it all started. Then I'd put this one on the shelf and re-read the others."
2,Disapointed,Based on the reviews I thought this would be a great romance. I was really disapointed. I loved her novel Temptations but I really could not get into this one. I hated the hero.
1,"DON""T READ THIS BOOK! YOU WON""T MISS A THING!!","It is a wonder to me how books like this can get published. There is simply nothing to this story. Any feminist should be disgusted entirely. I thought it was going to be a good story when the heroine didn't want to get married because she had a higher posiion coming to her. She was forced to get married of course but five minutes after she meets the hero (who just happens to be outrageously handsome) she declares ""Maybe this marriage isn't going to be so bad after all"" How trite can a person be. YUK! And then of course there is sex galore from beginning to end. All very senseless and poorly done. I feel sorry for the 8 people before me who gave it 5 stars. A real no brainer -- An extreme disappointment"
3,Montgomery,"..i like this book.In this serie, i've read "" highland velvet"" at first then velvet song and velvet angel and ended up with velvet promise.Both characters are very strong and charming but throughout the story, i find out that i'm a bit annoyed of Gavin. How can he stand losing his child without doing any punishment to Alice?and he is too blind to see that Alice is wicked.oh and one thing,Gavin slaps Judith's face in their wedding day because Judith, his wife,says something bad about Alice,she has right to do that..it's cruel for her to see her husband swear his love to somebody else.but anyway in the end Gavin loves Judith with all his heart..I've thought about it more positively that Gavin is too kind to punish Alice. I love Stephen and Bronwyn more"
2,I love the Montgomery's,"I love all four of the Velvet books. I can't decide which Montgomery brother I love. I could not put these books down. The first one I read, Highland Velvet, was so sexy and exciting. Then I realized there was more to this saga. So I bought all four books and now I am reading them all over again."
5,What a great book!,This book was hard to put down. I liked the characters right away a wanted to know more about them. I hope all of the Highland books are this good!
1,The Velvet Promise,"I'm halfway through this book and I cannot see myself finishing it. I was completely turned off when the ""hero"" (Gavin) slapped his bride. Not the kind of ""hero"" I like to read about. While the heros I like to read about are usually considered ruthless, it's on a battlefield at war or defending the woman he loves. And the main woman character (Judith) is pathetic. PLEASE...get slapped, raped and then enjoy having sex over and over and over again?Sorry, not my cup of tea."
4,Actually 4 and 1/2,"This was the first in the velvet series and set the setting for the rest. Though it was good, this was my least favorite brother. I hated the way he kept neglecting his own wife for a shrew like Alice. But, I love how strong Judith was. She could manage an entire household and keep her husband in check."
1,unexpected gain,i was extremely frustrated with this product. i had maintained my weight for months and just wanted to lose 10 more. i started on this product and actually gained!!! the only reason i tried it is becasue it said it was 100% guaranteed and so i sent it back and they only reimbursed me 75% . what a scam!!!
1,Feeling Ripped Off,I felt no different when I took this supplement - not even a caffeine buzz. Save your money - this is way too expensive to not work.
1,Waste of Money,I didn't see any difference at all. It made me sick. It is a waste of money. I saw some difference only with diet and exercise. Spend your money on healthy food not pils
1,No Other Seller changes Administrative Fee,"What a ripe off. Be ware of this seller!!! I would buy the same product from other place. If the product is so good as most of the reviews indicated, why charged administrative fee for returned products."
4,This has helped me to lose weight,I am very happy that I had ordered this for my daughters wedding I lost weight and I don't feel like I am starving or lost energy. I feel good and now I want everybody to try it outif you need to lose weigh.
4,Diet product review- Liopvarin,Weight loss and dieting is hard enough.... who needs to deal with a sluggish metabolism slowing your progress and frustrating you to a point where quiting your weight loss program is your only choice. Thank goodness for products with quality ingredients like Lipovarin.
4,Gosh....It Works!,"I decided to try Lipovarin with reservations. I felt it probably wouldn't work. I used it for one month with little results. However, I struck with it and by the second month I started noticing the weight was coming off. By the third month, the weight really started coming off. By it's self I doubt this product whould have produced stellar results. I had also incorporated an exercise program and lower caloric intake. I've tried this approach many times before ending in complete failure. I feel the Lipovarin did curb my appetite and gave me the energy to stick with my exercise program, resulting in successful weight loss. Without Lipovarin, I doubt I would have stuck with my ""program""."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"These are bunk pills. If you really want to lose weight go to a doctor or weight loss clinic and get a script for Adipex. Those will help you lose weight, but you have to count calories and exercise to get the full effect. That will be easy because Adipex or its generic version, Phentermine, will give you tons of energy and cut your appetite. That's how I lost all the extra weight after my first baby and that is what I am going to do to lose all the extra weight from my second pregnancy. Good luck!"
1,too much to do!!,"Tried this --- you need to have a secretary to tell you when to take what!!! next to impossible to do it correctly, but I did it by the book for 3 weeks and i think i lost a pound! Decided 1 lb wasnt worth the work or cost of this program!"
4,18 month report,"People looking for a quick magic wand need to consider gastric surgery... I was looking for slow but steady weight reduction (am over 50). Since age 40, I was gaining about 3 to 5 pounds per year. In 18 months with Lipovarin I have lost 20 pounds. I did not change my diet or exercise habits. I do find less cravings for ice cream and sugar snacks, that I eat smaller portions at my meals, take more leftovers home from restaurant lunches. I take three with breakfast, sometimes take 3 with lunch (taking three with dinner keeps me up late). I also take Thyrotril, one per day. My weight trend has been reversed! I am now down enough that my knees can take treadmill work, which I started 3 days a week about a month ago. Long term health trends are more important to me than whether or not I lose 8 pounds in 2 weeks!"
2,Overhyped,These pills gave me the same results as many other (and much cheaper) fat-burning pills out there. Lipo-6 is waaay cheaper and gives the same effects.
3,Lipovarin was highly recommended to me,I just placed my 3rd order and I am happy with my weightloss.n I have lost 26 lbs and counting.
4,I am losing weight easily,I am very satisfied with this product I am losing weight steaeily and easily. I just purchased my 3rd order.
5,Lipovarin vs. Trimspa,I have tried both products and have to say that the Lipovarin is the clear winner. Trimspa gave me some energy but i didnt see any weight loss. Lipovarin gave me energy and also helped suppress my appetite which was huge for me since i am a big snacker! I was very impressed. Skip the Trimspa if you are thinking about it!
4,The Best!,I have had extreme success with Lipovarin. I just hope I can maintain my weight loss after I stop taking it!
4,I am pleased with Lipovarin,"I have a litle less than four month until my wedding. I started taking Lipovarin in January to help me with my New Years resolution to lose 28 pounds before my wedding or atleast be able to get into a size 5 dress. So far I have lost a solid 6 lbs without really altering my lifestyle. I always went to the gym and I always ate pretty healthy but I have a very big appetite. Lipovarin has helped me with the ""snack attacks"" I have through out the day. I've increased my water consumption and just eat less. I feel like I sweat a little more quickly than I used to during cardio, I walk out of there drenched in sweat which is kinda gross but atleast I know the pounds are melting off!"
4,So far so good,I just ordered my second bottle of Lipovarin. This time I ordered the 150 capsules. I am pretty satisfied with this weight loss supplement. I see a difference in my appetite decreasing and also I don't feel jittery. It makes sense to take it just before you eat. I think this is a very good product. My sister in law turned me on to it. She and my brother both lost alot of weight using it. The true test will come when the weight stays off.
1,One star is too many for this lousy item,"I bought this product based on all of the positive reviews I had been reading and the money back guarantee. This product did absolutely NOTHING for me/to me. I do watch my portions and I do exercise. To make matters worse, when I decided to return it, I realized I needed a return authorization number from them or they would not even accept the product. When I went to ask for the number, nobody would return my messages. Soon, after contacting Amazon for help (thanks AMAZON!), they sent an email with a number and instructions. I also received a NASTY phone message the very same day from them, though......DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!! Don't forget, on top of all of this, you only receive a partial refund."
1,Buyer Beware...Don't waste your money,"If you are reading this it's because you are desperate to lose weight. I too was when I order these pills with hope that they would curb my appetite. I did read the other neutral/negative reviews about this product, but thought ""Maybe it will be better for me""...NOT! I even took one more than was recommended, thinking maybe body size made a difference with absorbtion. Forget it, this stuff is like taking a placebo. There's only one way to lose weight boys and girls, move more, eat less! I swear this is the last time I use a drug for this problem. What a waste of money!"
4,Positive Results,"I just started taking Lipovarin about two weeks ago. I have noticed a HUGE difference. Not only am I never hungry...but I've lost almost 5 lbs. in a week, without working out. I have a ton more energy. The only downfall of this product is that I have trouble sleeping at night. Try taking your second daily dosage mid afternoon, never later."
1,Don't waste your money,"After using this product for 3 weeks, I have actually gained 3lbs. :( I even added more exercise to my daily activities. All I got from Lipovarin is a lighter wallet and sleeplessness."
1,worthless,"I purchased this item which promised all sorts of things including a promise to clear up my acne. Never happened. The only thing this product did was to give me a tremendous buzz from all the caffine in each dose. I only took two pills a day and that kept me buzzed all day. I stopped taking this product after a week and a half. If there was a way to get my money back, I would surely do it!"
5,Thanks Lipovarin,"Thanks LipovarinAs I shed the pounds, I felt the weight of the universe being lifted off my shoulders... Expect astonishing results and your life to change for the better with Lipovarin"
4,Works for me,"I have been taking LipoVarian for 2 months and am just ordering my third bottle. I have lost 10 pounds, which is a healthy weigh loss of about 3 lbs/wk. I use the pills along with an exercise regieme of cardio (20 mins 3x wk) and moderate strength trainings with weights (3xwk).I have cut down on my coffe based on the manufacturers recommendations. The only side effects is loose stools, usually within an hour of taking the pills. This can also be attributed to my mild IBS (I poop a lot anyway).Another side benefit is an increase in energy and alertness. Not jumpy, just more awake.Works as advertised. Just don't look for a miracle weight loss cure, be sensible."
4,Weight loss review,This product helped me control my appetite and that alone helped me lose the weight I needed.
1,Does not work!!,"this product does not meet any of its claims! it does not suppress appetite, even with stronger doses, and it does not provide energy. don't waste your money!"
4,CUTS THE CRAVINGS,I have always been a sceptical believer in diet pills. I have lost weight in the past cutting the carbs and working out. I am also not really overweight but I am getting married in three months and needed something to help me lose a few pounds - quick. My fiance and I started these and they seriously cut the cravings. I am not hungry and do not look to food to comfort boredom. Since being on these pills only one week we are noticing the difference. I never noticed any headache and only get mildly jittery...imagine a grande Starbucks expresso. There is also no withdrawel feelings.....when my stomache starts to grumble - usually late afternoon I take my pills and sit down and eat a small meal - works great!!!!
3,Lipovarin is worth the hype,I am practically a walking advertisement for Lipovarin...only because I am a personal trainer and have seen such success with my clients who use it that I highly recommend it to everyone. Taking this alone without diet and exercise will not help you achieve your weight loss goals you have to WORK for it.
4,21 Pounds Lighter,I had set the goal of losing 35 pounds. 2 months of using Lipovarin and I've lost 21 pounds...so far. I have never felt jittery or irritable at all with the product like I have with others. I am also making it a point of drinking plenty of water with each meal. I think this has really helped both with me not eating too much and keeping my body hydrated. I am very close to reaching my goal weight so I can tell you that my experience with Lipovarin has been really great so far.
5,It Does Work,Lipovarin has been very helpful. I have been using it before I go for my daily walk and I have lost 15 pounds.
1,"I really wanted it to work, it didn't, save your money!!","I had success with ephedrine-based products, but after they were removed from the market the weight has slowly crept on. I purchased Lipovarin hoping it would provide similar results, it did not. I attempted to implement their money-back guarantee; I have yet to see a refund. (It has been MANY months ago and I have called on several occasions.)DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!I wanted it to work; I was just like you. I read the reviews, I did the research, I was assured by the money-back guarantee...trust me, it's a waste."
1,No Guarantees!!,"This product did absolutely nothing for me. I decided to give it a chance and complete the entire bottle. I have a 150 capsules bottle, and taking 6 a day, it takes 30 days to complete. I didn't start taking the pills until after a vacation because it's easier to stick to a diet plan at home.I stuck to a diet and excercise plan. Took the Lipovarin every day, and lost ZERO pounds. After running out of the pills, I gained 7 pounds within a week even though I had not changed my diet/exercise plan.I called them on their guarantee and they said it's only good for 30 days from the date of purchase. It took that long just to complete the bottle! Don't buy this product. It's a waste of money. Take that $70-$140 you were ready to shell out and go buy some new clothes. That will make you feel much better than wasting money on a product that simply doesn't work and supporting a company that uses questionable tactics to sell its product.I only wish there was an option to give it zero stars."
2,No results!,"If you are just trying to lose those extra 5 pounds, this product is not for you. I diligently took it every day for weeks, and NO results. I already work out 5 days a week and watch what I eat. And these pills did not help me get over the final edge."
5,From the Mouth of The God...,"Spine tingling when it comes to the words printed from AllFather himself! Diana L Paxson is probably the best writer in this particular genre alive today. I highly recommend this entire series, as well as Brisingamen!"
2,Used book purchase,"I purchased this book for a friend because we are both from this nation of people and it is very well written and accurate to the Siletz peoples history. However, I was very disappointed to have this book fall apart. The pages as they were turned came off the spine. The glue was no longer good. Now he has a book with loose pages. Because it was used, I am assuming it is non returnable?"
3,Princes of the city,3 1/2Typically meaty release is a solid set of neo-prog in the reliable vein of our era's greatest Yes-and-Genesis derivatives.
3,Nnnngh...,"Although I was well-impressed by the first Flower Kings album I bought (Stardust We Are, which I gave four stars but should have given five), I find that Retropolis, my second buy, isn't quite in the same league. Although the instrumentals are excellent (e.g. the title track), the more standard vocal tracks (""The Rhythm of the Sea"", ""The Judas Kiss"") leave me somewhat cold, lacking interesting lyrics or any discernable hooks.I emphasize that this is a QUALITY band, and I look forward to getting all of their CDs. If you're just getting started on them, though, I recommend you consider another album."
5,Very advanced text in mathematical physics with MATHEMATICA,"What a great book. The author has taken examples of how to use MATHEMATICA to a new level. Some topics are very advanced (chaotic systems, eigenmode analysis, the wave equation in three dimensions, ekonal and others), yet doable with MATHEMATICA, the reader gets insight into various topics of mathematical physics, thanks to clear exposition by the author. I wish I had a book like this as an undergraduate. The CD provided with the book is very helpful for trying out many examples. The unique thing about this book is that it is well-written and it is mathematically ambitious, a good source to imrpove your ability to use MATHEMATICA. This book (published by WILEY) has excellent production quality."
5,Quiet,"These brake pads were an exact fit for my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee and fit the bill perfectly. Instead of spending $700+ for a break job, I spent a 1/3 of that and did all four myself!Great deal, great price!"
4,Powerful bond BUT......,"This Liquid Nails Polyurethane based adhesive is very strong but far more viscous than its' Latex heavy duty counterpart. Poly takes far longer to dry so I would not recommend this for vertical applications without bracing it. BUT, once dry it is strong, maybe stronger than regular liquid nails. Also, it cost a little more too. This IMO is a better liquid nails option for those who need a more weather resistant type of adhesive long term. Once it's dry, it's basically indestructible and completely water proof. And as others have stated it makes a great caulk for more demanding applications.I would give this 5 stars but am deducting one because its drying time is longer and its a bitch to clean up with. USE GLOVES WITH THIS!4 stars."
3,didn't realize it was so big,"this came in one huge tube and i'm still trying to figure out how to open it without clipping it because once clipped, there is nothing to cover the opening and it will dry out. so this makes me think this is really for contractors or someone who really needs to use alot of glue at one time. price was good though and the glue works well with boards, wood and such. good for those ikea draws but your hand may be more cramped than you want it after because it's a big hard to squeeze out. it does come in smaller tubes at ace hardware or true value for $4.95 for 1/2 this size. it did arrive quickly."
2,Error in this version ISBN-2-03-542140-3,"Beware before you purchase his book! I really like the format and type size/font of this dictionary, but I just noticed that in the English-French portion, the words beginning with L are followed by words beginning with O. There is no M or N section! Page 384 is followed by page 449. This book is ISBN-2-03-542140-3. I am very disappointed because I love the dictionary and really don't know how to go about replacing it, other than to go to a bookstore in person and find an older version without the error."
2,Very disturbing with explicit strangling scenes. Don't know how truthful this film is.,"It's very disturbing with explicit strangling and choking scenes. It scared the wits out of me seeing these two men killing one woman after another. I don't know how truthful this film is. According to documents, they killed at least 10 people before being arrested.Nicholas Turturro is frightening as one of the killers. He looks and acts like a crazy person.This film is more curiosity-provoking than interesting. I give it two and half a stars out of five."
2,C. Thomas Howell Looks As Sick As This Film,"Keeping it short and simple. This is a sick film with acting that is not very good. It reminds one of a ""B"" movie from the 1970s. C. Thomas Howell looks like he has partied too much. He has lost a lot of weight and his face (with the aid of some powder) looks like something out of ""The Night of the Living Dead."" There us an interview with Howell on the DVD where he seems to try to save face, but comes off really weird (like a space case). This is not a great film, but it is entertainment for anyone who enjoys cheap trash with two-dimensional characters."
3,better than any other hillside movie ive seen,c thomas howell ive always enjoyed aswell as tuturo this movie would have been better if they went more in depth on the minds of these two nuts
2,Lousy product!,"After receiving this item, I realized I should have paid more to get something nicer - cheap, cheap, and my son never used it!"
3,SO SO,"Very compact, and the video quality while viewing on the Small Wonder is great, but when you transfer it to your PC, video is of lower quality.It's ok for fun but not for recording your childs graduation or wedding.The key here is compact."
1,Horrible product,My husband and I bought this product so we could send videos to my daughter and other family members via the internet. It worked maybe two times. It stopped downloading. We sent it in. We received another one to replace the old one. We used it one time. Now it is not working again and they want $89 to repair it. We will never buy one again. Please don't get caught with this crappy product. One more Chinese produced electronic for our landfills.
2,Disappointed with poor image stability,"I read a lot of reviews and bought this based on those.The camcorder is small and very easy to use. However, viewing the video on my computer shows how poor the image stability is. Every little movement of the camera shows as a very distracting gray screen long enough to make the recordings worthless. I am now looking for a better product.Don't waste your money."
5,Brings you back in time,"Just listening to this cd makes me think of another, younger time in mylife (not that I'm that old). Real music nostalgia for those who grew upin the 60's. This is a definitely a must have cd for fans of rock and rolland just good listening music."
4,great stuff but sound is not so hot,"Really like most of the music, although some is really hokey. I am not a huge fan but glad to have in my collection. However, the sound is clean but quite tinny with little base. Anyhow, glad to own it."
2,"Poorly researched, incredibly biased account of the peace process","I picked up this book hoping to learn about Israeli-Palestinian relations, and I was sorely disappointed. The author is clearly blinded by his ideology to actually paint a realistic picture of the Israeli-Palestinian relations. This is an incredibly oversimplified anti-Palestinian diatribe by an author who wants to paint the Palestinians in broad strokes as virulent anti-Semites hell-bent on the destruction of Israel, while the Israelis are innocent victims who never hurt a fly. The reality, of course, is far more nuanced and complicated. This book is so peppered with lies and distortions that the author quickly loses any and all of his credibility, and any truth he hopes to convey is lost among crude emotional appeals. If you want a balanced view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, read elsewhere."
1,Poorly researched demonization,"Lies, sprinkled with a bit of truth. More works like this will help assure that there will never be another peace process."
2,at ur service,"lame broading, no real good action. lame pick lines in script. lame broading, no real good action. lame pick lines in script."
3,Not what I was expecting,"When I got this album, I was expecting something a little more hardcore than this. Where is the screaming and catchy guitar riffs? What this album reminded me of is something a high school garage band put together in a month to get ready for the school talent show. FATA is my favorite band and I guess I was just expecting something a little more like that. There are some catchy songs on there, but this isn't one of those albums that will always stay with you. Quite frankly, it's forgetable."
3,Not Used Much,It helped for my class but beyond that I haven't used it since. Make sure you find it for cheap.
4,Up-to-date information,"Although I got this book as a textbook for a PE class, I have to admit that I find the information up-to-date and pertinent (how many texts do you know that use Tiger Woods as an example?) For the most part (I tend to be ""out there"" as far as health/nutrition/wellness beliefs)I found the information to be accurate and interesting."
5,So much cheaper than the bookstores!!,Product was exactly as decribed!! Came in on time. Also so much cheaper than buying it from th stores!! I am very happy with this purchase!!
3,Not the best but I'll take it.,"Old (or vintage) black and white video with poor quality but still one for the library. Another example of hard to find concerts from this time period. Very few great video and/or audio quality live performance out there. Hey, but it's Otis, you gotta have it."
5,Thoroughly satisfying,"This is the best video of Otis Redding available. It has his Monterey appearance as well as clips of his legendary European tour. Also great footage of Sam and Dave during the Paris concert. But much more important to me personally, it is absolutely essential for any Booker T and the MGs fan. The band is unbelievably tight and is the driving force behind all of the Stax vocalists. They steal the show. The best little band there ever was. Thoroughly satisfying."
3,otis remembered?,"This Dvd has some historical value, but does not reallyrepresent the Otis we know from Stax/Volt. One inportantelement of the ""Stax Sound"" was their ""slow/layed back""tempo's (even on their fast songs. To paraphrase Dan Penn""to fast a tempo is a cardinale sin"". The super fasttempo on most Otis Live Perforance seem over done to say the least. (How many ""gotta gotta"" can one stand. The Booker Tand the MG's part was good as was Sam and Dave. If you area real diehard Otis fan get this DVD. To most Stax Musiclovers it will be a disappointment."
1,For newbies only,"Not much to be said, if you know you're way a bit around photoshop this book is worthless, if you just learned how to turn on a computer and use a mouse this book is for you."
4,Revised review from hjohnson108,After going through this material in more detail I gained a greater appreciation of it. Not sure why I was so turned off at first by New Testament imagery since it is not that heavily used (probably says more about my background than the material itself :-) The discussion on chakra energy centers is truly excellent - one of the best I've heard/read. Unfortunately I still gag on the music which is a barrage of easy-listening drivel. Overall I recommend it to other beginning meditators although I think the material is better suited to text rather than audio format.
4,This audio tape provides new insights into Edgar Cayce,"This meditation tape really helps the beginner meditator. Not expecting one to have prior beliefs or religious convictions (though Cayce himself was a devout Christian and read the bible once for every year of his life), you can really benifit from this tape in amazing personal ways"
4,Good Intro to Meditation,This is a great item for someone practicing in Christianity to see the ties the Bible has to meditation - 12 step as well....
4,An excellent reference for lab students,I used this book to supplement the ocean of Herzberg referenced in my lab class. It seems pretty complete and is clearly written. The examples are very helpful.
2,Deadly Dozen,"I did not like the way this game was designed,and gave it away to a friend.I wont buy Deadly Dozen games,and I will not buy any of the Medal of Honor games."
1,Misinformed!!!,"I bought this game thinking it would not be a resource hog, big mistake!! The requirements mentioned nothing about having a 128mb vram video card. My system is nothing close to that, needless to say I experienced almost no frame load... What I could see of the graphics was ok, but like I said, without the proper video card, you better leave this one alone."
5,Best knife for the size,I think I have had about 6 of these in my life. Love the combination of this knife. It has the all the essential tools and the size is just right for a pocket. I don't leave home with out it.
3,Smells awful,"I don't mind the smell of pumpkin, but this was overpowering. It did sting a little (as expected). The results after one application were not noticeable. I'm not sure I can stomach another try though.Edit: This jar is TINY."
3,CAREFUL if you have Sensitive Skin (Redheads Beware)!,"I LOVE the smell of this product & would love to be able to use it BUT after just 2 applications, it created a pink chemical burn on my face that took about 6 weeks to finally sluff off (looked like a serious sunburn).I'm a blue-eyed, very fair-skinned person, one of the *lucky ones* who burns & turns beet red after 15 minutes in the sun.Take your skin type into account before using ANY peel--as I learned the hard way, you need to carefully match the strength of the peel to your skin type.I donated this to an olive-skinned friend & she LOVES it--works great for her, but was a BIG mistake for me. I give it 3 stars because it is a GREAT product for the right person but has the potential to burn the wrong one (me!)."
5,MyChelle is the best skin care company on the market!,"I love MyChelle products!! I've used several of their products and they are absolutely wonderful. I had struggled with adult acne pretty much all through my 20's but I don't have an acne problem anymore thanks to MyChelle. I love the smell (I love fruity but I know some people like my sister hate fruity smell...) and the feel and everything. And best of all you don't have to worry about what's in the product as they only use safe, natural ingredients. I recommend to everyone to give MyChelle a try!"
3,On The Fence...,"I really love the way this smells and it only has a minor tingle. I had a decent size trial so I used it at lease five times. But I am not fully sold on it. I wanted to really like it, but it just didn't seem that much better than my usual way of doing a natural peel (putting a paste of crushed pineapple and coconut milk on my face). Maybe I will try it again down the road, but it just doesn't seem to do much for now."
4,"Works fabulously, but smell can be overpowering",This stuff really works fabulously. I used it for the first time last night and my skin was noticeably brighter after. The only downside is that the smell is a really strong spicy smell kind of like chai tea.
2,Too Expensive,This is a nice peel but not worth the cost. You can use dove products that work just as well for a lot less. The benefits do not out weigh the cost.
2,Didn't Work for Me,"I love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin.. No skin tingling, no peeling, no brightening, nada. I heard that the company recently reformulated a lot of its products to use cheaper, ineffective ingredients so maybe this is one of those?"
5,Spazierengehen mit Nietzsche,"A beautiful, inspiring and informative book! I find Krell's erudition and passion for the subject matter beyond challenge; Bates' exquisite photography makes the feast complete. I have also travelled in Nietzsche's footsteps..."
3,Beautiful Book,"David Krell and Donald Bates trace the major sites of Nietzsche's productive period, tracing the French and Italian Riviera, Sils Maria, Turin, and the mountains of the Engadine in an attempt to examine the role of space in the creative work of this great philosopher. The book also serves the role of a miniature biography, the authors have done a great deal of research in the primary literature, reproducing a number of letters between friends, family, and colleagues. The book does not attempt to pinpoint the exact influence of landscape on the content of Nietzsche's work per se, still one does get the impression that the atmosphere of these places contributed to the dramatic flare of Nietzsche's style. The photographs are truly beautiful, but one still feels unsatisfied by the lack of analysis of the actual philosophy itself."
5,Love it,This is the best Finishing spray that I have ever used. My mom turned me onto it and I will never go back to regular Hairspray again. You have to try this if you haven't yet.
3,I miss the old days -,"So, another basic death metal album from Incantation. This time John McIntee takes on the vocals, and to be honest, I wish he didnt. He's not too bad, but Mike Saez & Craig Pillard mixed so much better with Incantations music. The music is pretty much what you would expect from Incantation; some pretty cool riffs, mixed in with some really bad ones. I really enjoyed the previous album, Blasphemy, and I was hoping they would follow it up with something as good, but they didnt.And hey, the artwork is appears to be based on the same concept as Diabolical Conquest. Makes you wonder if they ran out of ideas both musically and visually.I really miss the old sound that Incantation had from Onward to Golgotha up through The Forsaken Morning Of Angelic Anguish."
2,Admirable effort but. . .,"The video had its moments but overall I was disappointed. And I'm not the only one; I noticed that a lot of the gags fell flat with the studio audience as well. Seems like all the performers have some serious room for improvement. Dan Nainan was probably the best. Taylor Mason showed impressive skills as a ventriloquist but, like most ventriloquists, didn't seem all that funny. And I'm not sure how Tim Conway got five emmys, but it wasn't apparent on this DVD.And of course with all things of this ilk, Christians need to stop and ask themselves if this is the best stewardship of time. Which of us, when we get to the end of our lives, will ruefully wish we had spent more time being entertained?"
1,Thou Shall Laugh The Deuce,I did not get a change to enjoy this video because it is defective and I was not able to watch it.
5,HALARIOUS!,"These Christian comedians are truly funny... You definitely will laugh.. I enjoyed it very much so... It's already my fifth time watching it, and it's still funny. lol... I so want to tell you some jokes that they use, but you're just gonna have to get it.It's worth it!Good fun!"
3,Some Fun Sketches - but Something Not Quite Up to Par,"Even though I checked this out from our church libary I was unsure what to expect as I did not see the first in the series. My wife and I found it entertaining...I had seen some earlier sketches featuring Taylor Mason and continue to enjoy his humor but felt he went a bit over on his skit phoning God. His interaction with the audience was in better taste. I enjoyed seeing Tim Conway in his role as host, and found Dan Naiman very engaging. For some reason I had difficulty understanding Bone Hampton so I missed much of the comedy there. I would enjoy seeing more of both Victoria Jackson and Thor Ramsey. I'll be watching for other releases in this vain of Christian comedy. The audience response was strong. This can be an endorsement in itself. Good clean comedy."
4,Family Friendly Comedy,"I had seen the first installment of 'Thou Shalt Laugh' and really enjoyed it. I hoped that this one would be just as good and it is.This DVD features a variety of comedians who entertain with clean humor. Although most comedians these days seem to think that crude is what makes things funny, these do not. This is a DVD that can be played with the children at home.A couple of these have particularly good routines. I am most impressed with Dan Nainan and Bone Hampton. Additionally this is hosted by Tim Conway who is one of the all time comic greats.I recommend this as well asThou Shalt Laugh"
1,"Average Banjo, Not A Bargain For The Money","Banjo has some dead spots higher up the neck. It has a very bulky neck which is unattractive to players wanting fast action. Also it's sound is very average. Surprising, when you call Goldtone they are not knowledgeable about their own products.For a beginner this an OK banjo but that is where it ends.The resale value of this banjo is very poor.AVOID THIS BANJO !!!"
3,BIZZY BONE!!! What happened to you??,"Not this is not your average Bone Thug Material. Which is fine cause Bizzy isn't in Bone anymore. But.. Bone thug material is what i want to hear.. I mean the album isn't terrible, but it just wasn't what i was expecting. I do admire track 11 ""less fame"".. i love the chorus in that song. A plus about the album is you can actually understand what this guy is rapping about now. It is nice to actually hear Bizzy from word to word. But I miss that speedy trademark flow..Bizzy!! please rejoin Bone Thugs and take over the rap industry again!"
1,GARBAGE!,"BIZZY ONCE AGAIN LETS HIS FANS DOWN. BEATS SOUND LIKE HE MADE THEM ON A KEYBOARD! SO MUCH TALENT, BUT HE LETS IT GO TO WASTE WITH THIS TRASH"
1,some people just dont know when 2 quit,This by far has got to be the worst rap cd I have ever heard in my life. Bizzy only sounds good making slow harmonizing songs. His lyrics are garbage so his sound is what made him. For those who wrote a review saying he was deep are obviously lame. Nas is deep.
1,I dont even have to buy this,I heard the samples....how are you going to be talkin about God and then cussing the next second. Doesnt make sense. A lot of people dont even know what speaking in tongues really even means. Other than that...the album is just garbage...lets admit...bizzy bone is just wack now. No song on that album I feel is worth listening to.
5,damn bizzy,"cop this right now ppl, dont sleep on this man is genius, better then all stuff out now, i mean come on whats laffy taffy? d4l = no talent, bizzy got talent.great album, seeing things, bb da thug, shake ya stick and the rest all hot!"
3,wha? wha? wha?,"The production is lousy, you can't hear what Bizzy is saying, and the echo is as bad as everybody says it is. ""What U See"" is an exception (studio rat), most likely an older track. ""Shake Da Stick,"" well, he's saying it all. Listen. It's a good song. Bizzy has announced via the record company that put this out that he LIKES the echo. Everybody doesn't like the echo. If he did a whole song on here like ""Before I Go"" or ""Hellafied Game"" or ""Way 2 Strong"" or even half a verse, it would fine. But he doesn't. The rougher voice is nice, he just doesn't know what to do with it. And he seems after all this time in the business to have no clue how to release a decent sounding CD. If you keep hearing people say he doesn't care about quality or his fans, listen to Speaking in Tongues, its loud and clear."
1,This is too bad...,"I grew up on Bone Thugs. They brought something to the table that at that time was revolutionary. What happened? The only one still worth listening to is Krayzie. When are we going to see what these men have to offer, hopefully soon. I am sick of spending my money on filler tracks and production fit for sewer rats. Gentleman...Step up your game, we want diamonds, not cubics."
3,good story,"it was a good read, at some points a bit slow but in the end it got my attention back, might buy the next instalment"
2,Does not reach out and grab the reader,"It is just too hard for me to fathom the maturity given to this 16 year old heroine. It made the story unrealistic. Sixteen year olds are immature, impulsive, and have lapses in judgement. Not so for the perfect Alinor. I could not finish the book, my teenagers are inadequate compared to this young lady and I could not enjoy the book."
3,Great historical detail,This book is very interesting and well researched but was a bit of a slow read. It presented an interesting look at the Crusades and military strategy as well as the social mores of the period.
5,Roberta Gellis is a fantastic author,"This was a great find - a book I've had on my shelf for more than 30 years, now in Kindle format. This book pulled me into reading Roberta Gellis and brought an entire period of history to life. Read all of her Rosalynde Chronicles series - after this is Alinor, Joanna, Gilliane, Rhiannon, Sybelle, and Desiree. All wonderful books."
5,An Old Favorite - Simply the Best!,"I read this in the 70's when it was released in paperback. Roberta Gellis is one of my absolute favorite authors. I love Alinor because she isn't a typical heroine, she's direct, determined and very, very smart. As the Lady of Roselynde she has to be able to direct all of her Castellans and men-at-arms and know they will follow her instructions. She and Simon are a great couple.The thing that makes this book perfect is the historical element. Ms Gellis has a clear understanding of the history of that time and she is able to blend it into a wonderful story. I enjoyed reading this again and can't wait to re-read the rest.I've read all of the Roselynde chronicles and I highly recommend them to everyone. Outstanding!"
5,Wonderful!!!!,"This is an absolutely wonderful book, well researched and written beautifully. It is the first in a series that is always fresh and compelling. I read it when it first came out years ago, then read the entire series. It was delightful to re-read, like visiting old friends. I gave this a 5 star only because 10 wasn't available."
3,TMI,"The story is ok. Found myself getting bored half way through, there were so many obstacles. I thought the author even got bored with it. Some parts were so slow moving, detail by detail. Then others would skip large periods of time. I was putting it down and not returning until the next day or even worse, skipping pages."
3,lots of details,"I liked the book, it was a little long on detail, but all in all it was good to read"
1,Didn't finish,"I just found this too hard reading, maybe it was the period of the book that I didn't care for but the characters just didn't seem real for me and I lost interest fasstStory"
4,So many things to make with beans!!!,"I have tried several recipes in this book, and most of them turned out great! They are very, very healthy and you can discover so many ways to use beans you never thought possible.It's easier for me to cook with this book because I have a wheat-grinder, so I can also grind the beans to make all the bean flours it calls for. Sometimes the recipes aren't the tastiest---some of the bean flour soups turned out really weird...but other than that I LOVE this book!!"
5,Country Beans,Thus is a great cookbook for anyone tackling the dreaded gluten-free diet. It offers so msny options that you can use beans for...dessert inluded and gravy! Thx to the great store who's service was speedy!
5,Country Beans - How to cook dry beans in only 3 minutes!,"This book has opened up a whole new world for me as far as cooking with beans is concerned. Wow! Who knew how much variety could be obtained with just adding beans into regular family meals? I love the book and have noticed that when I go to various sites, Rita Bingham's book ,""Country Beans"", is referred to frequently. The biggest complaint is that she does not mention, at all, that some raw beans (bean flours) are toxic and can produce major gastric problems in some people, and I am not referring to just gas. With caution and proper cooking, this shouldn't be a concern to most people. This book is well worth the money."
2,Hippy commune cooking,"When I bought this book I thought I was getting a simple living book about how to cook beans. I guess I should have read more about it in amazon, but it reminds me of 1960s hippy commune vegetarian cooking. Not what I had in mind. A lot of soy, tofu, honey and all that. I wish someone would write a book about plain cooking that uses beans and meat!"
2,Noisy and Ineffective.,"I am not a fan of this fan.It's small and cheap, but that's where my list of positive things to say about this fan ends.This fan does a terrible job of actually circulating air, even at close range. Also, the fan is very loud."
2,Noisy but compact,"This fan is okay for a small space, but the fan blades chop air so loudly that it's not very practical for an office or for use in close proximity to the user who needs to hear what's going on around them. It moves some air, but it's highly diffused - not focused well. Not what I'm looking for in an office/desk fan. Good for 'white noise', like one reviewer mentioned, though it's not true white noise. It mostly sounds like a Cessna flying overheard."
3,better than the last...,"While I like many of the Pernice Brothers' songs, I think Joe Pernice likes to listen to himself sing a bit too much. He often tends to regurgitate the same basic melodies and vocal voicings, which is too bad, because a lot of the songs could be so much better. That said, he does take a little bit of a side road on many of the ""Discover..."" songs. I especially like the first three numbers, the title track, ""Amazing Glow"" and ""Red Desert"". The drum machine is a real negative here, though."
2,They Mailed This One In,"Located right in the heart of this CD are two songs that epitomize the problem. They are the the throwaway song snippet ""Dumb It Down"" and the very dispensable instrumental ""Discover A Lovelier You"". The rest of the CD more or less follows a similar pattern of presenting some interesting ideas that are not fleshed-out into real songs. There are actually only three songs here that measure up to the Pernice Brothers' songwriting of their previous releases. Two of them, ""Saddest Quo"" and ""Snow"" as well as the passable lead track ""There Goes The Sun"" appearing as the first three cuts had me enthused that this was another stellar release. However, my disappointment quickly set in with ""Sell Your Hair"" which sounds like a Simon and Garfunkel B-Side and the ponderous ""My So Called Celibate Life"". After what I would rate as three great five-star studio releases, this one is really disappointing."
3,Discover a Lousier P.U.,"Why hast thou forsaken us, Joe? Being a Pernice Brothers' fan, this pains me to write this review as much as it pained me to hear their lastest release. If I gave a star for every good song, then three stars would befit this ""weak song-works eclipsed in a trauma to the expected fans' ears."" (liberal, creative licence taken) Three good songs out of 13 -- That's only 23 percent.To use a basketball analogy, it's more enjoyable to watch Shaq shoot free throws ( at least he shoots in the 40's). Am I too hard on the Bros lastest effort? Maybe. Am I disappointed? Definiety. Pardon me while put on ""The World Won't End,"" and remember what defines great songwriting."
4,"A Lovelier You, Indeed!","With their 4th studio release ""Discover A Lovelier You"" [13 tracks/39 min], The Pernice Brothers deliver yet another batch of songs full of melodic charms.Amoung the highlights are the catchy opener ""There Goes The Sun""(an obvious choice for a single), ""My So Called Celibate Life"", ""Amazing Glow"", and the almost Iron And Wine sounding ""Pisshole In The Snow"".Another interesting song is the album's title track, an instrumental (which they are not known for), that might be one of the more memorable recent pop instrumentals I've heard.One criticism (a minor one) is that there are no lyrics incluced, and not much as far as liner notes go, just a brief listing of personnel. The artwork is good, as usual.All in all, this is likely to please most fans of the Pernice Brothers previous work. If you are a curious fan, and are looking for a good entry point into their catalog, you can't go wrong here.Highly Recommended!"
2,On the verge of av,"2 1/2There are somewhat-smart transitional attributes to be found in between this indie pop's verse and choruses, but most of it comes across as a slightly more southern Deathcab in its most restrained phase."
3,Not as good as her first,"Bare bones gets bogged down with too many characters and subplots. After a while, it was difficult to focus on who was doing what and why. Deja Dead, her first novel, was so intense and focused, that it is difficult to comprehend how the author has come to ""lose the scent."" She is a good and craftful writer,who just needs to reel her story in."
3,Obnoxious Tempe,"Although I have enjoyed the plots and the science in Ms. Reich's storys, I find Temperance Brennan to be a very unpleasant character. She is rude, impatient,condescending and demanding. She is also a terrible mother, giving her daughter scraps of her time after she has done what she wants to do in terms of her career and her romances. I find myself wondering if Ms Reichs has modeled her character after herself. In her ego inflated world the main character can be as obnoxious as she wants to be, yet she is still highly respected by her colleagues and sought after by a very eligibly man who apparently could have any woman he wants. I don't see this as being likely in real life.Please Ms. Reichs make Tempe more likeable, give her some manners and some patience and understanding with her fellow man. After all she is supposed to be so compassionate and caring about those who have died, how about a little of that compassion for the living."
3,I agree to everybody rating 3 stars and lower,"Having read every prevoious Reichs novel unable to put the books down, I felt very disappointed by this one. I still like her style of writing, but the story was so ill-constructed and wannabe-intricate that it made me yawn. I totally agree to everybody who rated the novel 3 stars and less before me - you took the words right out of my mouth!"
4,Triangle Clues,"Only Kathy Reichs can plot a suspense mystery from bird feathers, goldenseal and bears then interweave a budding romance for Temperance Brennan. BARE BONES is a can't put down read for fans of this series. The title was the selection for our bookclub this month and it will be fun to discuss.Dr. Brennan is in North Caroline awaiting the arrival of a special friend to share the first vacation she's had in years. She goes to a picnic with her daughter and Boyd, her estranged husband's dog. Boyd digs up more than discarded hot dogs and a case of a burn baby gets complicated.Forensic mystery at its best as the reader acquires extensive new information.Writing as a Small BusinessQualifying Laps: A Brewster County NovelUnder the Liberty Oak"
4,A Super Read!,"I loved this one! Years ago I read the first two books in Reichs' series and I remember enjoying them, so it was like going home when I picked this one up. In need of relief from reading submissions (I'm a publisher) and this was close at hand.In this installment, Temperance Brennan is due for a vacation and is actually looking forward to it. At the worst possible time, Brennan's job kicks into high gear and bones begin dropping from the sky. And not just from the sky, while at a picnic with her daughter, their dog finds a bag of bones and Temperance has no choice but to put her personal plans on hold. Every time she thinks she sees a light at the end of the tunnel, more bones turn up. Each discovery puts another twist on an already puzzling and dangerous case.BARE BONES is a great read, with enough twists and turns to keep you going from page to page without hesitation. Kathy Reichs is a fantastic writer and I'm looking forward to getting caught up on all the books I've missed."
2,Disappointed Reader,"I am a big fan the the TV show Bones, and I thought the books would be similar. However, when I read the book, I found the only character that was ""similar"" was Temperance Brennan who was not the same as the person on the show. I think if I had never seen the show I would have enjoyed the book, but because of the show I did not enjoy the book at all. I gave it a two-star rating because I guess I was prejudiced and I know better to compare it with movies, etc. but it is so ingrained in the mind you can't help it. I was very disappointed."
3,great book bad ending-Bare Bones,"The book Bare Bones, written by Kathy Reichs introduces the reader to the world of forensic anthropology through her interesting main character, Temperance Brennan. In the book, Brennan has three cases to solve. As she gets more evidence and brings the clues together she starts to think that all the cases are connected in a very disturbing way. During the book, Brennan has conflicts with co-workers, and gets back into the dating game after a tough divorce. The book was very detailed and is interesting enough to keep the reader turning the page. The end of the book was very dissapointing, even though all the cases were figured out, it seemed as though Katy Reichs just finished the book without the great detail that she had put in the beginning of the book. Despite the quick ending, I thought the book was easy to read and was very interesting. If you are interested in science and lot's of adventure, then Bare Bones is the book for you."
3,Bare Bones,"I was eager to buy the new Kathy Reichs book and dive into it right away. It started out okay, but as the book progressed, there were too many characters in and out of the picture.This made the book seem disjointed somehow. It was not a smooth read. I sincerely hope this was an aberration on the part of Ms. Reichs and we can expect more of her wonderful books such as the first three she wrote.I am on page 155 and to be honest I don't care whether I finish it or not! The next Reichs book will be paperback for me. Save your money and get it from the library or wait for paperback. You won't be disappointed."
4,A Real Page Turner,Yes there were punctuation errors as well as grammar but not to the extent that the book wasn't readable! I love this author and I'm a huge fan so I'd probably like anything she wrote. This story not only kept my interest but I loved the humor when she was dealing with the Columbo like Detective. I guess Kathy Reichs is as close as you can get to Patricia Cornwell. If you love to watch CSI then you'll love this book. I hope Ms. Reichs continues this series for many years to come.
3,Forensic pathology lite.,"This is an OK entry in the series of books by Reichs. But, in comparison to her previous books, I just felt this one was sort of, well, .... lite. Nothing wrong with it, but at only 304 pages, there just wasn't that much to it. And the very preachy last few pages were WAY out of place. I happen to agree with opinions expressed in these last few pages, but a novel is not the place to preach."
2,"Rambling, confusing and ultimately boring","This was my first Kathy Reichs book and it was quite disappointing. Too many characters and subplots made this book confusing and rambling. The plot was interesting so I kept reading, but it was difficult to keep going and I had to resist the urge to skip to the last chapter. I have read the most recently published books of other ""series"" and enjoyed it so much that I read the entire series. But I would not read another Reichs book."
4,great story,"This is the first novel i have read by Kathy Reichs but i will certainly start looking for her other books. This was an enjoyable read. The technical jargon may be over some people's heads, but she explains all you need to know and if you have any medical background at all, you will love it. The pace is good. I love the way she incorporates a love interest without turning the story into a romance novel. There are twists and thrills to be had in the book's 306 pages. Ms Reichs writing is smooth and flows without getting bogged down in alot of nonsense you don't need or want to know. My only complaint is i feel she rushed the ending a little bit. She builds up a grand climatic ending and just sort of gushes it all out instead of letting the ending unfold on it's own. I will definitely catch up on her other books i have not read yet and i will continue to read her books in the future."
5,Temperance Is At It Again.,"This book is great, full of adventure, thrilling and as always writtento keep you turning page after page.We all wish we were Tempe."
2,First Reichs I've read...might be last,"I was very excited to read this book, as I studied forensic anthropology in college. Within the first chapters, I became very disappointed. The only reason for me to continue reading this is because I have no other books. I read the reviews that this isn't the best example from the author but I will hesitate when buying another one of her books. It is boring, easy to put down, and an overall slow read."
2,"Interesting story, annoying writing","An interesting story with an environmental message (didn't want to give too much away). BUT ...The writing was really annoying.Too many paragraphs.You know, that trick of putting almost every sentence in a new paragraph.Every sentence.To give it the illusion of movement, dynamism, action.Or just make your books seem bigger.Either of which are annoying possibilities.Roger Zelazny, now he could pull it off.He was a master.But in this book, it's just horribly annoying.Too bad.Because, as I said, there's some interesting subject matter.If one too many lucky coincidences.Anyway.Just glad I finished it, done with that cheap writing style."
3,Slipping,"This is the sixth in the series, and Ms. Reich is slipping in the thrills department. The story takes place in North Carolina, while Tempe is supposed to be on vacation. This is a nice change. But it made for a tame read, compared to her others! But at least it wasn't bogged down by all the coincidences all her previous books presented. Maybe that was the problem, this time it was too ""realistic"". Ha! Overall, a mediocre read."
2,Long and drug on...,"It kept my attention...barely, but I felt there were no exciting points. It kept dragging on and on and still nothing interesting happened. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Waste of time,"This book is terribly laid out, with many incomplete or all too conveniently wrapped up plot twist options, with little tie together and wrap up. I read it on a trans atlantic plane ride and was angry that something so poorly crafted could be published let alone sold en masse. Just plain terrible..."
2,Losing Her Touch,"I can't remember if Tempe Brennan was always this annoying, but somehow it doesn't seem like she was. Throughout the book, the plot seems secondary to Brennan's snide comments about the people she works with. Everyone is ""straight out of central casting,"" wearing a tie ""got from a Kmart bargain table after the good ones had already been picked,"" ""has the IQ of parsley."" No single character in the book seems to escape Brennan's ire, with the exception of Andrew Ryan. Their romance finally heats up, but with her attitude, the only thing you wonder about is why he bothers with her."
2,Another sin of Sabatini's literary nonage,"Another uneven novel written while Sabatini still seemed to be learning his craft. There are bits in the end and the beginning worthy of the mature Sabatini; but not much happens in the middle, at least by his usual standards--he seems to be aiming for a different genre and audience. The writing livens up at the end, but the plotting remains weak, and the ending is preposterous."
5,ROAR E SAURUS,"This is a great little backpack. Finding any Blue's Room characters is difficult so this was a wonderful find. My son loves it and is able to recreate Blue's Room episodes with a little costume design by me. Robot Rory, Rory Elephant etc... Very happy with it."
4,Very nice,Just bought it this summer but the initial quality is just fine. It is normal for these things to stretch out the first several times you use them so expect to tighten it each time you use it at first (easily done); I did have to buy an extra link to complete the hardware on one end which was a minor inconvenience
4,"Very nice magazine, but...","... instead of buying a subscription you should go to www.cardplayer.com and see all the articles of any of their magazines up to and including the newest edition. Then if you feel so inspired to get print copies, it'll be alot cheaper to get it from the CardPlayer.com site.The forum at the site has alot of good info too. You don't have to be a member to read from the forum. Good Luck!"
5,Worth the Money but Best When Free.,"I sometimes read this when I go to a cardroom where they have free copies to take with you and I enjoy it everytime. The interviews are excellent and they usually have big name players writing articles which increases its ""street cred,"" if you will. I love the website and followed its WSOP blog meticulously over the summer so I could keep up with the action and root for Greg Raymer from a distance. Also, I took advantage of the free email address they offer which is handy on top of being pretty cool. Cardplayer is the next best thing to reading a serious book."
3,thin thighs and poor service guaranteed,"I was impressed on how quickly the dvd reached me, however kinda angry that I spent almost $14 on it only to see the $5 price tag stuck to it. I emailed the vendor who never responded. Won't purchase anything from them again."
3,Lots of good info,Pretty interesting micro-history about coal and how it influenced (and continues to influence) history. Not as good as some other microhistories (Salt and Cod leap to mind) but still an educational and interesting read.
3,Insightful,"Very insightful, and I learned a lot about commodity use (wood, coal) in London in the 1500's, as well as the start of canals and railways to carry the coal in the newly founded Pittsburgh in the 1700's.Light read, and interesting. My next read is the Mountain Top Removal in the Appalachians. Coal: A human history, was my idea of learning more about this commodity to prepare myself for the Mountain Top Removal book.I don't think I needed to prepare myself, but I learned a great deal from ""Coal:..."" none the less."
5,world history at its best and worst,"From ancient times of 200 BC to the 2003 dilemma of global warming, Barbara Freese holds your interest in the gift of coal and its curse. I found her writing mesmerizing like Rachel Carson's, full of scientific fact with cultural dimensions throughout history and on every continent. From the burning of lungs while cycling across town in China to the child slaves used in coal mines all over made this history hard to stop reading. A must read to help understand our world environment and why the US needs to be a participant in leading. Hope President Bush and Condi Rice read it!"
4,"Very informative, easy read but...",she did neglect (or didn't realize) to mention that the bloody Nazi bums under Hitler used coal to fly their airplanes in WW2! I hate coal because those Nazi swine used it in lieu of oil for plane fuel.
4,Cool,"This game is fun and VERY educational... I even forgot I waslearning while playing it! The games are fun and have different levels, so if one level is too easy you may make isharder and more challenging. It explains the mini-gameand how to play. The charactors are click-able and they seem to talk and help you throughout the whole game.You meet cool alien type things, and in order to survive, you must figure out the answer to the mini-games.The backround music is pretty cool, but it may get annoyingyou can turn off the music, too! before you begin the game, it shows a mini movie of what's happening and it tells aboutyour mission.I love this game!"
3,Out dated info!!,"This book is good, but the fact that the tracks in the one i recieved are different from the ones listed on the web page was very dissappointing (especially as i got this book mainly for Led Zep's Lemon song which is one of the ones missing"
3,Good Deal,"I purchased this phone because we have a limited # of phone jacks in our home and I needed more phones than I have jacks. So far, I have been satisfied. The only 2 things I have found that I don't especially like are regarding the cordless phone. The volume is extremely loud and find myself constantly trying to turn it down although it is on the lowest setting. Also, it takes much longer than any other cordless phone I've owned to charge. However, it has sat off the charger for 2 days and was still able to be used. Over all, a good deal."
5,Favorite toothpaste,"My italian greyhounds love this toothpaste more than any other kind. It works unbelievably well at removing any accumulations on their teeth. It's amazing, actually, and they adore it."
4,doggie toothpaste,"I would have preferred more mint flavor/scent and gel instead of pasted. However, this formula does seem to work better longer for neutral breath. I also would rather have a plastic tube instead of ""foil"". Great product - little messy because of paste - would buy again if our regular mint gel is not available."
4,A Hauntingly Good Read,"Not only do the supernatural elements of this story entertain, but the interpersonal and ""interpet"" aspects make it more engaging. The fate of Gussie and Oatmeal, while upsetting and vividly described, connect a reader to the real emotions experienced by 14 year old Teddy who is troubled by his confused sexuality and, to put it mildly, dysfunctional homelife. The ending of the novel is satisfying and a culmination of a tale that will remain with a reader after the book's final page is finished."
4,Interesting reading if you are of Norwegian decent,Found it very interesting reading and actually had a relative quoted in the book. Pretty cool!
1,"Tiresome, Pretentious & Redundant","I tried to listen to the taped version. It's 12 two-sided tapes, with an advertised running time of 15 hours and 5 minutes. After about 10 hours into a car trip, we voted unanimously to put in the last tape, just so we could satisfy our ""Who dunnit?"" curiosity. Alas, even that strategy was frustrated, as only one of the murders is solved on the last tape. The writer's style is both pretentious and repetitious, a deadly combination. After we had heard ""lugubrious"" for the third time, the groans became audible, even above the traffic noise. The writer's obvious fascination with the styles, manners and customs of London in 1890 have led her to assume that all her readers are similarly inclined. For me, they got in the way of the story... constantly! I got the book/tapes from the local library, so it was free. It still wasn't worth the price. Unless you're fascinated by the trivial aspects of living in London circa 1890, save yourself from a gruesome ordeal."
3,Better than Highgate Rise...but still needs...... what????,"This story was better than highgate rise. I thought it was well told. The very last few pages dragged on a little too much. I am still looking for something within the pages to make me ""feel"" something for the characters. There is still that undefinable something that makes you genuinely care about characters that is missing. If you have a desire to understand and connect with characters in a story, then I would not recommend this one (although sometimes you come close with Emily & Jack). If you really don't care about that aspect of this type of story, then I think it makes good reading. -Reed"
3,Some Chills,"While the killer is easily figured out (for us reading the book) the main thrust of this book is the continuing story of Pitt and his work. The benefit of reading a long series is those readers can follow a family through good years and bad, anticipating the continuation of a story line. Some of the sub-plots in this book will be continued in future volumes. I felt Charlotte and Emily were underused in this story although Perry explained that away. Not the best in the series, not the worst."
1,WHERE IS THE INFORMATION??,"I really would like to check this product and I am very curious about it. However, the site provides almost no information about it... May I know how many CDs are? What is the list of songs?? Is there a special sleeve for each CD? What type (similar to the original release or a new one???).If I have access to such mandatory information, I may consider to buy such collection and I may well change the rating from one star to how many deserved..."
3,Expected a lot better...,"Seeing this up on amazon used for $40 I expected it to be something epic... it wasn't. I only paid $15 for it and was starting to regret it after the first few songs, luckily it got better about halfway thru. My favorites had to be Daughter, Bushleaguer, and Don't Believe in Christmas. Ed and Matt are great as usual, cool to see Boom's first show with the band, Mike and Jeff get more into it as the show goes on, Stone just stands there, not even facing the crowd for the bulk of the it... not sure what is up with that, figure he'd be a little more animated for a homecoming show. 3 stars for the second half of the concert. If you're a big fan that needs to own everything try to snag it cheap, dont pay $40 for it! If you're a casual fan lookin for an exciting PJ DVD, try Twenty or Live in Cornice much cheaper, much better."
1,false advertising,"bought a jar of this at a specialty storeAte half the jar with my wife, it's not even a little bit hotafter half a jar and no drink I only had a slight numbness on my tongue, which faded as soon as I took a sip of drinkTaste was just ok, I found it just a bit too sourWith a name like ""salsa from hell: beyond hot"" it's straight up false advertisingdon't bother"
5,A classic,"This book is a classic must -read type book. Well written in that style only Sax Rohmer can do - and his story is one of his best. Read it, love it!!!!"
3,Cannot be ignored,"Any serious student/lover of nineteenth century Russian literature must be aware that despite the dearth of artistic merit ""What is to be Done?"" possesses, it nevertheless is absolutely vital for a greater understanding of the ideas of the period. Without proper knowledge of Chernyshevsky's work, it is almost impossible to fully appreciate the nuances of other, more artistically gifted writers, of the time, such as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev and Goncharov. As such, while the reviews here criticising the style of the novel are well valid, they nevertheless must admit its overwhelming influence on the other writers of the period, and that alone must make the serious reader ""plough"" through the pages of this book."
1,A preview of the Gulag,"This book is the moral and intellectual equivalent of ""The Turner Diaries"" as written by a 19th century Russian radical--Utopian idealism combined self-righteous hatred, a lust for power and a thirst for blood. If you want to understand the vicious mentality which lead to tens of millions of deaths in the Soviet gulags, this is the book to read."
5,very washable,"I used these paints with 2nd graders and was so relieved at how easy it was to clean up afterward. I like the variety of tones in the paints. For a great lesson, use with the book, The Colors of Us. Kids can use these paints as a starter to mix paint that matches their own skin."
2,they are all pink to brown colors !,"The multicolor title means that the colors represent all the skin tones, from pink to brown and in between. I had not understood that at all when I orders this paint...."
4,Death OMG Star,"I was tickled to have finally gotten a Death Star, now I have to figure out how to hang it."
5,"It's so good l, I covet to have written it myself!","A quite complex combo-area, and he's done more than an adequate job of it. Hurrah!"
5,I loved this book!!!!,This book was fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable. The ending was a little heavy going and slightly unbelievable but still a very enjoyable read!! Looking forward to Khaled Hosseini's next release.
2,Sensationalist and poorly developed,"I liked learning about Afghan history through the first part of the novel. But I felt once things got bad in Afghanistan things got really bad in the book. The characters were flat. Relationships seemed contrived. And the return to Afghanistan to rescue the boy was just flat out sensationalist and exploitive - like a public execution. And let's please have a reality check. That little boy will never be okay. He may find a way to survive and cope with the world, but he will never be ok."
2,Why waste time on this rag?,"This book is terribly overrated. ""Things Fall Apart"" is a much better book, and shows everything that ""Kite Runner"" lacks. KR just relies on some depraved things to attempt to gather an air of substance. Q&A (slumdog millionaire) is also a much better book than this dreck."
3,Lays It On Thick,"2.5 stars. I started out loving this novel but at some point well into it, I felt like he could not shovel the poop fast enough and all the sympathy I'd built up turned into disgust and even anger for his lack of respect for the reader. I mean, give it a rest. I wound up hating the book but cannot dismiss the long stretch of good storytelling before it went sour so he gets some stars."
5,"Unpleasant things inside, but a good read","Very good book, but it did upset me with the lifestyle and how they treated different classes. In most countries, we don't see this and don't realize how different classes and women are treated.Excellent author as everyone knows already and a book that teaches us about a culture we aren't familiar with.Everyone should read it, but be aware of unpleasant happenings"
4,Wonderful story; can't believe it's fiction!,"Although this is a fiction novel, I know this story is probably similar to many Afghani experiences but any part of this man's life experience can be substituted by any one of ours. I think THAT is what makes this story so poignant for those that have read it.I admit that when I saw this book and found that it took place in Afghanistan and has some afghani language mixed into the story, I thought I wouldn't be able to get into it. But I bought it anyway to read on my vacation based on the reviews I've seen. I'm so glad I did because the characters and their situations are so easy to relate to. I highly recommend this book!!"
5,Overwhelmingly affecting,"This book sent chills down my spine, and brought me to my knees in Khalad's overwhelming ability to pinpoint and recognize even the most subliminal of feelings. Good writers can make you understand the charactors feelings, great books can make you feel the charactor's feelings. This was a great book, and I am sad that I could not have spent more that a day reading this. A real soul-stirrer."
3,Kite Runner,"The Kite Runner is a tragic book. Some of the tragedy serves a purpose in the story and some does not.I think the author pushed the envelope more than a bit in this novel. It borders on soap opera. However, its depiction of life in Afghanistan is very compelling. For that reason alone I am glad I read it."
5,A Perfect Read,"I usually am disappointed when I a book comes highly recommended. This is the perfect book about the complexity of human beings. It is also a wonderful book about forgiveness. It doesn't end happily ever after- which is why I felt it ""perfect."""
5,Excellent Read - QUICK AND INSIGHTFUL!!,WOW!!! Exveryone shoudl read this!!! This book grabs you from the very beginning. I found myself longing for the story to go on. This books clearly illustrates how our choices shape us and who we become. It also conveys the complexity of male communication.
3,Good but a little strange.,"This is a well written book. The way it describes landscapes, people and places is very evocative. The characters are also well drawn and easy to emphasize with.The story is also powerful and moving and I particularly liked the way the book doesn't bow to cliche or bathos and attempt to wrap up a very complex situation in a neat way.The way thing that was a little strange for me was the incidence of male on male rape 3 times in the story. This didn't ring true as believable the way of the rest of the book does. I'm not sure if it was used for shock value or as a metaphor for what has happened and is happening to Afghanistan."
4,what an author,"generally, i'm not into fiction books. so, i may not be the person to consult about the rating of a fiction book. however, this author is talented. at one point, i had to put the book down for several days to ""digest"" its dispair. but i HAD to pick it back up to find its hope! a little disappointed about the ending since the story was so captivating--one emotional twist after another. but he is gifted nonetheless!"
5,An inspiring read!,At first I was hesitant to read this book. But since my book club chose it I dove in. What a ride I had! I was worried that it would be bashing America book but quite the contrary. The author has led a very interesting life. It is amazing to me the changes he experiences growing up. I would highly recommend this book to young and old alike!
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,This is one of the best books I have ever read. A book you just can't stop thinking about.
5,A thousand times over...,"Just finished it. I refused to leave my house after the fist page and devoured it all over the weekend. It is ironic that there is a kite festival in my city this weekend...will attend next year. Hosseini has a talent for reaching inside a character and bringing to the surface every nuance of him. The reader can internalize Hassan's lips twisting to form a smile so guided by his devotion to Amir. The book is filled with little gemmed phrases and urges ones own childhood nostalgia to re-emerge. A definite recommendation for a peek through the window at what WAS and IS now the dispirited land of Afghanistan. The bad news?...you may not finish a book for a while after this one. They quickly become dull. ""Tank you weary match"" to my friend NS for recommending it."
4,"A Warm, Beautiful Tale","I wasn't expecting to pick up The Kite Runner and read an honest-to-Allah story. In fact, I was expecting a humdrum recital of Afghanistan's miseries. Instead, I was proven wrong by Khaled Hosseini, who delivered a stunning portrayal of human shortcomings and weakness, set in Afghanistan and America. The story gives a glimpse into Afghan life, but doesn't beat us up with it. In fact, the two main characters are so real, you want to weep for them.Wonderful, memorable story."
5,Unforgettable,"I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't stop myself from devouring the book. Haunting, lyrical, moving. It still stays with me."
2,Predictable Sensationalism,"Usually, I am very sympathetic to young, aspiring writers who pull on their heritage to write about terrible situations around the world, but this is not a well-produced and well-thought out book. The villain is immensely hateable, pulling on all the Hitler/germanic (half) pedophiliac fears lurking in American culture, sadist, brutal and sensual. The love story converts the hero into a suppressed pedophile himself, and the recurring images try to hold together an otherwise predicatable story. I hope Hosseini can do better with his next work."
3,Good Book BUT VERY DEPRESSING - BAD LANGUAGE TOO,"If you are looking for a book that that is very well written, a book that will give you a good idea of what life in Afganistan was like when the Taliban took conrol and if you don't mind a book that has a lot of language including numerous ""F Bombs"" then you'll love this book.There is a very well written and well developed story here but it is so depressing that it just leaves you with an icky feeling inside. Most of the depressing things in this book are through the fictional aspects and not necessarily directly (although indirectly) related to the Taliban taking control.I don't mind a book having some depressing/bad things happen to the characters but I think this book was a little over the top. It's just so depressing in places that it leaves you with a haunting feeling.The book ended, soft of, on a igh note but not enough for me. Very well written though, I can easily see why so many people liked it."
2,Too fabricated,"Hosseini lost me when he had Amir go to a soccer game in Kabul while searching for his half nephew. This is supposed to be believable? It's obvious that he feels we don't know anything about the Taliban and he had to somehow work it into this book. I HATED the character Amir from the moment he left Hassam in that alley. To me this is more a pulp fiction novel than a story of redemption. The hokey ending was very difficult to swallow. I expected this novel to go someplace and it didn't. If you want to read a GOOD novel about the Taliban, Kabul and the cruelty of the men in that part of the world - I recommend you read BOOKSELLER OF KABUL."
2,Overrated,"What a huge disappointment. This book started out interestingly but turned into a soap opera with preposterous coincidences. None of the plot twists were surprising at all and I saw them coming a mile away.The author's style was readable, however. But I expected more from the story."
2,all those 5 stars. really?,"taken simply as a inside view of afghanistan, this book is interesting. then there's the plot. the heavy, heavy-handed, contrived, contrived, plot. the good guy is really really really good, and , oh the bad guy, he is so so so so bad (he even admires hitler, gasp!). the really really really good guy is killed of course, but his young son avenges him (with a slingshot!), or course (again). This is the type of ridiculous, laughable plot that hollywood turns out over and over and over and over and over. I really don't need this simple-minded crap in the books i read. I got this book because of all the good reviews/blurbs i saw it got. come down to earth people. this childish plot is painted with two colors: black and white. no shades of grey here. this is cartoonish to the extreme and i am annoyed to have wasted two afternoons with this junior highschoolish drivel."
2,Not as good as the critics say it is ..,"The first few chapters were really good, but then the rest of the book just didn't deliver. You can see the denouement coming a mile away and it wound up just being one big soap opera. I was really disappointed after such a great beginning ...If I had to say something good, then it would be about the descriptions of the country and culture ...."
2,What a disappointment!,"With all the great reviews of this novel, I was very disappointed. If ever there was a book in need of a thorough editing, this is it! The beginning part of the book is very good, but it reads as if the entire middle part in the U.S. was added as filler, so the author could resolve the issues raised in the beginning. There are ridiculous details, such as Amir screaming over and over -- with his jaw wired shut?? The ending seemed totally unbelievable to me. He just happens to meet up with his nemesis from childhood? What a coincidence! The author obviously has some talent, but this reads like a first draft."
4,Beautifully narrated,"What I loved about this book, other than it kept me reading til' the end without giving me the desire of putting it back on the shelf, was the beautiful way the author narrated the succession of events. The author captured my senses and transported me to the time and place in a way I could feel and smell the air the way the characters were. A story where a foreign culture is exposed in a simple way that will keep you wanting more. Definitely a gem which I highly recommend..."
5,IF YOU COULD PICK ONLY ONE BOOK........,"The book that stands out above the rest, The Kite Runner. The 5 star rating on Amazon's book review is what prompted my fast pace to the local book store. The 5 stars that Kite Runner received as it's ""average rating"" was indeed ""right on the money"". If you could read only one book, make ""Kite Runner"""
4,Not the usual,This book is way different from what I am used to reading Some times its hard to switch gears and enjoy a different type of book but I really did enjoy this one.
5,Book for all time!,This is an incredible read- natural language and a story that will stay with you forever.
5,Heartfelt and Moving,"This book moved me beyond words with this humble but yet powerful and emotional storyline. This book showed how young boys from different classes of life came together as best friends, like brothers. Then the progression from young boys to young men became blatantly clear how different their worlds indeed were. The pivotal turning point for one of the young men was an incident that happened to his less fortunate friend. The seconds that this stomach churning incident occured and he witnessed, changed his life forever. This book shows emotional ties to culture and the redemption of a soul. Please read...it is a difficult read.Katherine Baumann"
4,"Really great book, but slightly incredulous","I really enjoyed 95% of the story. Moving, troubling, I really did love the book.It did get a little bit of ""what ELSE could POSSIBLY happen?!?!?!"" near the end."
5,Life,"This book is beautifully written, even through all of the pain. This is only the second book I have read which tells a story, but teaches significant life altering history in the process. You see, history bores me, but the clever gifted author is also an inspired teacher. Definite page turner, finished in 1 day. Gave it to my daughter to start reading."
5,Both touching & harsh...,I learnt a lot from this book about a totally different culture and also about human relationships...Its a very well written book and was so touching that it brought tears to my eyes in a few parts...I totally enjoyed reading it and have also started reading his new book...I like the way Khalid Hosseini writes & look forward to his forthcoming works.
3,Predictable but engaging,"I can see why everyone is reading this book. I'm glad I did. I had to overlook only two issues which, though significant from an editorial perspective, was easily done.First, the secondary character (Hassan) was too perfect to be believable--though absolutely fun to love.Second, the primary character (Amir) came by his redemption a bit too neatly, making the plot predictable--though engaging.I picked this book up because one of my best friends is from Afghanistan, and I thought it would be interesting to read about her heritage. I learned much information about the traditions and politics of this troubled nation, but I learned more about myself. About humankind. About the beauty and ugliness of friendship and the desperate need we have for grace--perhaps not what the author intended for me to learn, but effective nonetheless."
2,Very disappointing,"After all of the accolades I had high hopes for this book. I'm always interested in discovering good new novels written by new authors.The beginning started out promisingly. The stories of young Amir and Hassan in Kabul are told in a very taut and interesting manner. Where the book falls apart is when Amir and his father move to America. Characters become cliches and stereotypes, and situations become predictable. If you can't figure out every ""plot twist"" 20 pages in advance, then you're a naive reader.Without giving away any of the plot, what happens later in the book when Amir returns to Afghanistan and Pakistan is just ridiculuous, and would make for a bad TV special. Everything is just too neat and tidy and resolutions come too easily.Hopefully we as readers can learn to appreciate writing which is much more complex and thoughtful than The Kite Runner."
2,Commercial? Yes! Great? No!,"The prose is workmanlike but not distinguished, The plot is contrived and lapses into melodrama and the maudlin. Afghanistan is merely sketched as the novel's background. A Cliff-Notes tour of a country and its customs. The book is, however, a page-turner, thanks to its editing: bite-sized chapters, each of which ends on a note that encourages reading onward. Which pretty much defines many a modern best-seller. For a quick, non-demanding read OK. For more substantial fare, look elsewhere. I note that many reviewers here who lavish highest praise upon the novel are students and those whose reading range seems limited."
5,very hard to explain in words,I had tears in my eyes on some occasions and found it very difficult to put this book down once I started. This book touches your heart in some form or another. READ IT!!! You will not regret it.
5,The Kite Runner,The author kept the reader's interest up--AT ALL TIMES.Loved the book--am anxious to purchase and read the author's next title also!What a precious story!
2,Not all that...,"I put this book down truly wondering about its success. At this point, I feel like the only reason for its fame is because Westerners know so little about the featured cultures and religion. I thought it was average at best."
5,An excellent STORY,"It's an excellent STORY that merges fact and fiction expertly while invoking deep human feeling. I initially heard about this book via a BBC broadcast and bought it off Amazon. It was a great buy - the story itself reminded me of reading John Steinbeck's ""The Pearl"" when I was a teenager. I later bought the movie as well but was utterly disappointed. Key areas of the book are left out including the bathroom scene (readers will know to what I am referring).Recommendation: Buy the book - forget the movie."
5,Exceptional book,"Best book I've ever read. The characters are so real, you could almost touch them. By turns heart-wrenching and hopeful."
5,Another book every American should read,"A wonderful glimpse into a world that Americans know so little about. It is easy to be disconnected with South Asia and Islam, but for how much our government (and our tax dollars) have meddled with that part of the world we ought to find the time to read this extraordinary book. Khaled Hosseini offers an excellent opportunity to learn about the beauty of his ancestral country and religion while at the same time giving us a chance to understand some of the ugliness."
5,I am amazed,"I am really happy I have purchased this book, Before I bought it, I had read the reviews about the book. HOwever, the book itself exceeded all my expectations. I can not stop reading it. Its simple language and exciting plot can only amaze the reader. I would like to thank the author - Khaled Hosseini for giving us the pleasure of having the book on our shelves, and the Amazon.com for timely deliver. It is the first time I have purchased the books at Aazon.com and I am sure I will become the constant customer of it. Thank you all very much.Natalie Mgeladze,Batumi, Georgia"
5,worth the hype,"This is worth all the hype. Sorry for not a longer review, but others have said it better. Cannot say enough about this book"
5,An excellent read for me and for my students!,I use this book with my 11th grade English class. We use this as the basis for an Immigration Research Paper. The book is excellent and has so many more details than the film can ever provide. Well written and powerful. This book excites even the most recalcitrant reader.
5,Excellent reading!,"Khaled's story is excellent in the simplicity of his narrative style, and engages the reader so deeply that the reader shares the narrator's childhood friendship with Hassan, and then carries his burden throughout as the book unfolds, and looks for redemption, which he does find towards the end.An emotional story well-told against the backdrop of the massive political changes the country is going through."
4,New type of book for me,Great read with some real insights into a new cultural education for me. Amazon provided the discs within days of the converation recommending the book so there was a good recollection of the story and it was a joy.Roderick J.Clemente
3,Much overated,"This story should have ended at the point the hero left Afghanistan. The second half is almost completely useless. Overall, an overrated piece of work, partly due to the fascination of U.S. people on Afghanistan caused by current events."
5,Incredible,"What a powerful story, told with dignity, honesty, and heart! The pain of the years of tragedy in Afghanistan is told through the eyes of very human people, and yet is told with grief and redemption. It is one of the best books I have read in a long, long time!"
4,What took me so long?,"I had The Kite Runner in my hands at the book store and library more times than I would like to admit and some how it never made it home until a few weeks ago. I really had a feeling that the story would be hard to follow because it was about the Taliban and Afghanistan but I was wrong. Granted, there were a few words and phrases that I did not get but the story was certainly easy enough to follow. I found parts of the book to be a bit choppy and wordy but over all a very good read.I am not going to give another recap of the story because there are certainly enough reveiws of The Kite Runner here but I will say that I am very glad that I finally read this book and if you are having doubts about it, give it a try. You just might be surprised."
4,"Very moving, Great First Book","Bravo to Khaled Hossaini. I feel that this is a remarkable debut effort for the author. He is able to connect the reader with the history of Afghanistan, without objectifying the Afghani people and culture. In addition, he brings amazing insight into how the Afghanistan has transformed into its present state.With that said, the books is deserving of another set of editors. There are too many artificial cliffhangers, created by the sudden ending of chapters. In the end the book becomes predictable, because of it.I look forward to more of this author's work. He is very talented."
2,Are you kidding me people?,"After hearing/ reading the glowing reviews for this book I couldn't wait to read it. What a huge let down. Cliched, formulaic ....before reading it I thought this book would really educate me as to the culture and the reality of living in Afghanistan during the period covered -- no such luck. The story could be set anywhere, so little insight was shown. Wow, I can't believe 99% of the reviews are 5 star. I didn't give it one star because it's not the worst book I have ever read...but really, definitely a big letdown after all the hype"
5,The best,The first half of the book at times was OK but the second half I could not put down. I loved it and everything about it. This was the best book that our book club has read. It has alittle of everything.
5,The Kite Runner,A gripping account.Ought to be required reading for anyone who wants to understand the real people we are facing in this world. Gets behind the headlines and sees the unknown human impact of well-known events.
5,A Moving Story,"Overall, this was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The narrator was very believable to me, and the story gave me a different perspective on the Taliban, Afghanistan, and Eastern culture. I was impressed with the way the book dealt with the sensitivity of family issues and with the loss of innocence. The only criticism that I would give is that the fight between Amir and the Taliban man was a bit farfetched and overly-dramatic. I liked the way the story ended, though, because it was honest, but also uplifting. Hard to put down because of the mystery and suspense, and it was not at all predictable. A great book!"
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!! It is bound to become a classic.,"""The Kite Runner"" gives a rivetting view into the life of a boy growing up in the war torn country of Afghanistan, his escape to America, and his eventual return to face the people and memories he tried so hard to forget. Reading this book gave me a whole new perspective on family, friendship, and the violence and war that have been going on in Afghanistan for so long, continuing to tear the country and its people apart. The story is absolutely beautiful and heartbreaking. I was unable to put this book down, as cliche as that sounds.You won't be able to help loving this unforgettable book. I really believe that ""The Kite Runner"" will go down in history as a classic.You will not be disappointed."
4,Excellent!,"A wonderful book with great insight about life in Afghanistan today. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It pulled at my heart strings throughout the novel, and the ending leaves more to be wanted."
3,too dark,"This is a well-written novel but be forewarned that it contains some very dark and haunting images and storylines. I am surprised this novel is selling as well as it is. You can learn a lot about a country that most Americans have never seen, but what you learn might disturb you. I also found the ending to be rather unsatisfying."
5,Very good,"I am a fan of Clay Aiken and he recommended this book to his fans. This book is excellent...I loved it and would recommend it to others..I couldn't stop yelling, screaming, getting mad at the book. I just couldn't put it down and I also was able to learn some new words in a different languge..I do recommend that when you read this you have tissue by you.It's just great."
2,Great first half - Horrible second half,"I bought this book because of all the hype - many people told me about it and what a great read it is. When I started reading it seemed to answer my expectation: a taste of a different time and place and a view of Afghanistan before wars turned it into what it is today. Well, without revealing the plot, when the book reaches the turning point something weird happens - it turns into the most two-dimensional, hole ridden, not surprising 'surprises' laughable garbage I read in years... I mean, how can such an engaging story turn into such total crap? The last 100 pages or so are a real straggle - you'll be laughing and crying but for the wrong reasons - laughing at the ridicules plot twists and crying over your valuable lost time. So if you have to, rent it and read the first half or so - when you fill it's starting to sink bail out."
2,poor writing; painful to read,"The book started off alright, but pretty quickly it became clear that the author lacked skills for portraying psychological and emotional depth of his characters. In the second half, he seems to completely give up even trying. It reads like it's a child writing--very shallow and schematic. As lots of reviewers point out, the author relies on cliches way too often. As a result, it becomes almost painful to follow all the ""coincidences"" and read dialogues in which all characters sound the same. I feel this book does a disservice to Afghanistan and its people by turning everything into cliches. I would not recommend this book."
4,Haunting,"Kite Runner is a moving, well-written story, but I don't know that I'd recommend it. It's kind of a bummer."
4,I loved the Kite Runner,"I never saw the movie but had heard so much about it and the book, that I decided to read it. It was very good and very informative about the life and customs of the mid-east."
3,The Kite Runner,I enjoyed the book. It was in fairly good condition. The book arrived as agreed on time by the seller. Thanks.Monique Lamar
5,very exciting book.,"Like the story,It tells of the rich and poor.Recomended to any one who loves to read.The writer is very good."
3,It was good.,"I do not typically read fiction but ""The Kite Runner"" was good. Hosseini is good at developing his characters and appealing the reader to the perspectives of each. He makes clever plays on words often; I was impressed.It IS a STORY however and most people don't make things right in the end. Especially if you are from a war-torn area - you are crippled inside for the rest of your life - thinking about yourself and your survival only, not others. I guess when you are in survival mode, there isn't much thought to fairness."
4,A View of Afghanistan through a Changing Friendship,"The Kite Runner follows the life of Amir, a wealthy boy living in Afghanistan, as his country changes under the Taliban. However, rather than giving objective accounts of Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban, Hosseini focuses in on the Afghan tradition of flying kites and combines it with the political history of Afghanistan to allow readers to experience the story at a more emotional level. Hosseini's story begins with the childhood friendship that develops between Amir and Hassan, the servant of Amir's father. As they grow older though, a life-altering event takes place. The relationship between the two boys distorts and later, ceases to exist, only to be revived by an astonishing turn of events - all told in Hosseini's powerful language and vivid imagery. Ultimately, as readers watch Amir and Hassan's relationship bend and break, they also see Afghanistan warped by the Taliban."
3,"Quick and engaging, but some minor quirks...","I bought this book after all the great reviews from the media, friends and family. I really thought the book was a quick read and kept you engaged. The story was well thought out and complete.There were some minor quirks I had with the book, including all the Afgan words. Sometimes there'd be an English ""translation"" of it, and other times, not. It was a tad irritating.I didn't love the book, nor did I hate it. It was ""ok"". The story had some really graphic moments in it. The story seemed to sum up quicky at the end, after very detailed chapters before it. I think this is a ""read once"" book."
5,Stirring,"Often in school I have been asked to read books because they are defined as ""classic."" They are thought to have fundamentally changed society through the manner in which they were written.The Kite Runner is a modern-day classic, and though it may sound cliche, it is a must-read. Without giving away the plot, the narrator recalls through a flashback his childhood struggles, both internal and external, as well as how those struggles translated into adulthood. The Talibani regime in Afghanistan is portrayed in a chilling manner, and the reader is left to examine his/her own morality, encompassing devotion, friendship, honesty, and self-respect.This novel is definitely recommended; don't hesitate, go out and buy it. Just a caution that some parts of the novel are graphic. Overall a chilling and real-life tale."
3,If you like coincidences . . .,"It's good book. The first half, when the narrator lives in Afghanistan, is very good--vivid, evocative, exotic, and (also) universal. In the second half, the author corkscrews through numerous plot twists, always aiming at the giddy and sensational. The plot is built around coincidence and repetition. The first half is riveting; the second half keeps your attention, but only through manipulation. Bottom line: get it from the library."
3,"hopeful beginning, but disappointing...","I picked up this book with excitement and anticipation, having heard great things from friends. I enjoyed reading about the adventures and trials of Amir and Hassan's childhoods. It was captivating and page-turning. But after Amir and Baba move to America, it was all downhill from there. For some reason, the writing and the storylines became very predictable. I just didn't really feel for Amir and his hardships. As other readers have stated, the plot-twists seemed too contrived and soap-opera-ish. I found myself skimming thru paragraphs just to get thru to the end. I felt that the writer did a good job at the beginning of developing the characters, which is what drew you in as a reader but somehow that was lacking in later chapters. The ending was, as was the middle, somewhat predictable as well."
2,Illustrated Edition Not Worth the Extra Money,"Let me begin by stating that I love ""The Kite Runner"". When I got an email notice from Amazon that a newer edition with illustrations was available I contemplated spending quite a bit more money since I loved the story so much. Luckily, I didn't buy it. The photos add nothing to the original story that makes this version worthwhile. I highly recommend the book, but don't waste your money on the illustrated version."
5,Best book I've read in years!,"I finished this life-changing novel last night. I am still inwardly touched by its effect on me. I could not stop reading for the last one-hundred or so pages.Not only did this story inform me about the author's homeland, but it gave me a refreshing view of Islam, showing me that it is a many-sided religion. I now value Islam more and understand it is not unlike Christianity, in its positive and negative history and expressions.The story of the protagonist's life somehow got to me, reminded me of unsettled issues and guilt from my past.I've got to say, this book is unlike any I've ever read. It's got to be one of the best and all-time favorites for me.I thank the author for his wonderful gift."
4,page turner,"Loved this book. I couldn't put it down. The characters leapt off the pages. I learned a lot about culture, family and character through this book."
5,I loved it!!!,"This book was outstanding and the new film did it justice. As a teacher/librarian, I would love to suggest this book to my students, but it is hard when a movie has been produced. I am not mad. I understand that most great movies come from heart warming books. So all we can do now is try to read the books before the movies are produced. This book is something great, if you have not seen the movie. Otherwise, pick up Slendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini and start reading!"
5,Read This Book !,"Anyone who loves great literature should read this book. I read this book in two days (and two late nights) and cried at the end. Not only did the book contain exceptional characters that drew me in emotionally, but I was sad that I was finished with such a fantastic novel. I never wanted it to end! In my mind, one of the marks of a great novel is that, not only is it enjoyable to read, but it changes the way you look at the world. The Kite Runner certainly meets that criteria. Congratulations to the author for such a fantastic debut."
5,Thankful I read this book,"This is one of the best books I have read in the last year or two. My measure of a good story is, when I've finished reading, do I still wonder about the characters and think of them months later. . . I will think about Amir and Hassan for a long time."
4,A Blend of Fiction & Reality,A completely enjoyable read. The author is focused on his story & remains there without adding needless fluff. The novel is a wonderful piece of family & human fiction which many can identify with. It's intertwined with non-fiction backgrounds & time-lines. The blend between the two works extremely well making the book very difficult to put down. It grabs your interest quickly & does not let go
4,AMAZING TO THE END.,Recently I have been looking and asking around for page-turners. This was no disappointment. It has taken me several years to scratch the surface of understanding what is going on in the middle east for decades. It's truly heart breaking. This is a story of love and finding inner peace where almost unreachable. I loved this book and recommend it to all.
3,Dark,"This is another one that was very interesting for me. The subject matter was very dark and disturbing but the style of writing was intriguing. It was a very true to life story that got a little too true to life for me. It is about a boy growing up in Afghanistan around 1990 named Amir. He comes from a wealthy family and his best friend is a lower-class servant boy. The servant boy, Hassan, would walk on water for Amir and when tragic strikes the boy, Amir runs in shame. It is a story about redeeming himself and his constant struggles with his heritage and his escape to America with his father. Great story. Disturbing content. Only 3*'s for me on this one. I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,"Mostly gripping and a page-turner, but...","This book has a lot of promising elements in its characters and set-up, but the author ties up the plot too neatly. Some of the intended surprises turn out to be far too convenient, bordering on obvious. A less traumatic turn near the story's end and less conclusive finish would have been more satisfying to me. If Hosseini had linked the first chapter's hindsight and the events of the latter part of 2001 moreso, the ending might be less happy, but perhaps a great deal more meaningful."
3,Do You Have It Inside You?,"I picked this up after enjoying A Thousand Splendid Suns so much. I will say that this book didn't move me as much as ATSS did, but that doesn't mean that I didn't find it thought provoking. Now I wouldn't use Hosseini as my only source about societal rules and conduct in Afghanistan, but I will take it as insight in a country where these things have a very strong impact on life there. I thought all the intricacies of the relationship between Amir and Hassan, the ethnicity conflicts, the upper/lower class conflict, plus their personal conflicts and jealousies were well established. I also thought that Amir's internal struggles and confusions were also well written. I could really identify with his feelings and needs. I will say that the story was a little soap opera-esque, but I enjoyed it anyway."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read!,"The Kite Runner is by far the best book I've ever read. I'm not a big reader, but when I was assigned this for my college English class, I was excited to start it as I'd heard great things about it. I was not let down. I absolutely love everything about this book. I'm not going to give another summary because there are already many in other reviews, but The Kite Runner is a must read.Key themes in this book include betrayal, redemption, loss, affluence, and suffering.Just received my copy of ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" (also by the same author) today and cannot wait to start reading it!"
4,A View into another culture.,"I liked this book because the story moved quickly, the characters and story revealed elements of another culture (I'm a Sociologist), and the message the story contains is very relevant. This book made me think about the differences between people in different cultures and how their religions and experiences are so different than our's (in the U.S.). It helped me reduce ethnocentrism in my personal views of Afghan/ Arabic people. I read this book pretty quickly and I was glad I did - it was a good read."
5,A must read.,"If you've not yet had time to read this book over the summer then I suggest you put it on your book list for the fall. It is well written, keeps the reader's attention through to the end. It is one of those books that you just can't put down. The story gives the reader an open window into the life of two young Afghanistan boys from age 12 to manhood who come from two different religions as well as economic and social classes; but develop a close bond of friend ship. Their relationship is complicated by evil cruelties and prejudices, deep kept family secrets and a betrayal that haunts until it is brought to closure by a powerful desire to make amends for a childhood injustice committed out of fear, shame, and confusion."
5,Deeply moving,"A tear came down when I finished this book. And, btw, I liked the movie too (for different reasons)."
4,entertaining introduction to Central Asia,"I very much enjoyed reading 'The Kite Runner' because it reminded me of the time I spent living in the neighboring Central Asian country of Uzbekistan. My first thought about reading a book about Afghanistan was of reluctance; I imagined s story of despair and tragedy. But Mr. Hosseini's book is more than that. It is about friendship, loyalty, and the importance of family ties. And these are the aspects of Uzbek culture that I admired. An entertaining, enlightening read."
4,Neverending story,"The kite runner catches your attention from the very first moment. The reason why I called it neverending story is because it is non stop; once you relax and enjoy a description something happens which alters the course of events, this happens until the very end. The main character's life is described with great sensitivity. The story helps to understand other cultures."
5,a different world,i really enjoyed the twists and turns. this was such a different story. original and very well written with an excellent plot.
4,Fantastic,"I feel bad because I have given other books 5 Stars but this only four...This is not because it is an inferior book. It is extremely well written and touching and definitely should be a mandatory read for most Americans as it is quite insightful and gives a different perspective of Middle Eastern culture, specifically Afghanistan.I gave this book four stars because some things seemed...off to me. I feel stupid saying so but for some reason I wasn't completely sold on all the details of Amir's life journey. A little ""too much,"" maybe. I have fought with my boyfriend and my MOm about Baba as well; they both love him and I have major issues with him. ANYWAY it's a great read and a fantastic ending...not too mushy."
5,Amazing.,"I don't read much fiction. I prefer biography and history. I have never written a review of any book, although I have read many. This book was incredible. The detached, almost documentary like style with which the author records violence, rape, inhmanity just makes you cringe. You feel as though you have stumbled into a room where although everyone is silent, you can tell from the faces and the details that something unspeakable and unforgivable has just happend. And I am sure it does."
3,Why Didn't I Love This Book?,"I'm still not sure since it was an entertaining story and a quick, easy read. Maybe too quick and easy. I felt the author took some shortcuts that detracted from it. If anything, I would have liked more, more history and background. What a missed opportunity to really explain the Taliban and Afghanistan history more thoroughly but still in the setting of a novel. The 15 year leap to California was unconvincing, and simply just seemed like lazy writing. Much of the plot was predictable.I found ""Atonement"" a much better psychological novel of a terrible act commited by a young person, and the resulting consequences and guilt.I'd recommend this book, but with reservations.And did it really win the Pulitzer Prize, as another reviewer stated?"
3,"Good engaging story, but a bit over the top","This is a nice novel that starts great with a highly engaging first half that is packed with childhood activities and emotions. The second half of the book, however, seemed over exaggerated, too action-packed and predictable. I thought the ending was also predictable and weaker than expected.The part that is real and cannot be over exaggerated in the book is the racism and the ethnic cleansing in Afghanistan. It is disturbing to see how ethnic cleansing is going on in many parts of the world. How it kills in the name of god, religion, tradition, nationality, etc. And, how it destroys love, compassion, families and humanity.Overall, it is a good summer read."
2,Predictable,"I am generally very sympathetic to young, aspiring writers who venture to write about tragic events around the world, but this is not a very well-thought-out book. The predictable love story converts the hero into a repressed pedophile as the recurring images try to hold together an otherwise lackluster story."
4,A good read,"Personally, being forced to read a book is very hard. In Kite Runner, the names are similar to me but the storyline in brilliant. I have not pasted the 5 chapter but I can already tell the themes."
2,"First part of the novel, awesome; Second part...","As said in another review, the first part of this book is interesting and describes Afghanistan well. After a few chapters it just feels like the writer didn't know what else he could write and started writing anything to fill the pages. In my opinion, most people said this is a good book only because they heard other people saying the same thing. The Kite Runner woulld definitely have made a great short story if it would've been only three chapters long, beacause the rest of is totally dissapointing. It becomes tragic and tedious. If I'm giving this book a two-star review it's only because I really enjoyed the first part. My advice, if you buy it, read until the part where Hassan and his father go away."
2,"Unbelievable, No really, ludicrous.","Don't read this book if you're a fan of literature. And if you're looking for something about real life in Afghanistan try non-fiction like The Bookseller of Kabul. Having said that, this is a very exciting and readable novel about the lives of some fictional Afghanis before and after the Taliban took over. It's severely marred though by broadly-drawn characters, cliched plotlines, and worse: by extreme coincidences that would shame a Hollywood screenwriter. I don't mind that kind of thing in a book that is clearly superficial but when an author is writing about a real time when tragedy and difficulties befell a great deal of real people, I find it more than a little unseemly."
2,Can we have another twist of the plot?,"Here is woe. And more woe. And the person who started the woe, a childhood bully, grows up to put the whole society in woe. Wow."
3,A Ruined Memoir,"The first half of The Kite Runner (the part where it's memoir) is wonderful and fully deserving of the accolades the book has received. The second half (the part where it's fiction)is a completely absurd, lurid descent into sentimentality. The novel should be used in MFA programs everywhere as an illustration of how easily a masterpiece can be ruined by terrible plot decisions-- didn't this book have an editor? If so, he or she should be hanging their head in shame. It's too bad, because this book had the makings of a classic and instead will be a forgotten afterthought in a few years time."
2,guilt amongst the book club gang,"This book is not very good. Defensive writing, tiresome coincidences ( random character conveniently works at INS), an evil half-german, child rape (the rapist gets punished, dont worry), dull characters (except the narrator's father). Dr. Hosseini's remarkable success with this work (top 20 in Amazon) is either a testament to his shrewdness or to the guilt weighing down the chattering classes that read such writing at their book clubs."
2,"over-wrought, over-interpreted, over-rated","A real page turner that doesn't hold up to scrutiny. It relies too much on coincidence. Also, the author doesn't trust the readers enough to draw their own conclusions. Rather, the author amateurishly tells us how to interpret the scenes. (Note for example how many times the narrator ends the chapter with some prophetic line like, ""This was the last time I would laugh because my world was soon turned inside out"").The climactic scene in which the author liberates the son of his friend from the clutches of the mein-kampf-reading villain is laughable. Of all the houseboys in Afghanistan to sodomize, how likely is it that he would seize upon the son of his childhood victim? Or that, in the fracas, the narrator would receive his own hair-lip? And if you didn't get the symbolic wounding, the author feels compelled to point out that now he, too, has his own scar. p-lease."
3,Overrated,"Khaled Hosseini is a perfectly decent writer whose chief contribution to English letters is his subject matter, nationality, and topicality. After all, how many Afghan-American novelist can there be? Were he a white, male all-American type writing about going home (to, say, Kansas), it is doubtful he would be given the time of day by today's publicist-editors. Nonetheless, this is a decent enough piece of writing and, it must be said, one finds oneself drawn to the setting. The before and after depiction of Afghanistan is compelling, and the author's harsh treatment of the Taliban took some courage in our age of moral relativism; in the hands of an MA creative writing teacher, the author would have been forced to see ""both sides,"" thus gutting the story's singular virtue, namely, its anger. As it is, the thugs are shown to be thugs. This is not, however, literature. Perhaps the remainder sales catalogs are right in describing it as ""fiction."""
2,mediocre and poorly written fast food.,"This man should first attend an english class on 'cliche' before pelting them at us so savagely - so relentlessly. I was in a constant state of painful literary paroxism. I had to read this, I was verily forced to read this for one of my fiction-writing classes, and I was thoroughly disturbed by the combination of lack luster writing (it's said to be 'spare', but more properly one would call it talentless)and high praise. The fact that it has more than its share of 'script' moments, scenes that would be more enjoyable on screen than in a book, is a testament to its indolent abuse of letters.I read the equivalent of one modern novel every other day and with all the wonderful literature to choose from I would save my resources for something of value, perhaps a classic. This is rubbish, and that's why it's popular."
5,Best book I've read in a long time,This book is on my new Favorites List! I couldn't put it down. I made my husband read it as well and he loved it too. It truly is a great story. I heard an interview with the author on NPR - he is an amazing person. I highly recommend this book - you won't be able to put it down.
5,Growing Up in Afghanistan,This painful story paints a vivid picture of life in Afghanistan. The characters are dynamic and the story moving.
4,Amazing,"This novel was recommended to me by my sister and I have to say it is one of the best I have ever read. At times I couldn't put it down. Powerful, expertly written, and compelling, I now recommend it to anyone I come in contact with."
4,Very easy and fast read. Would make a good early High School book,"For those who don't like to read, this books is a simple formatted book at the 6th grade level. I thought the story was great and it makes for a great discussion. I would recommend it simply because its a fun-fast read."
5,Highly recommended,Great story that gives insight into the life and culture of Afghanistan. This book was hard to put down once I started reading it.
5,Wonderful Book,"Amazing plot twists, story, and intricate details that tie family and love together. The passion there is in this culture is amazing. I love it!!"
4,very good reading,"Although the story was difficult emotionally and heartbreaking, it is well written and very interesting...I would recommend it as well as another book by the author--A Thousand Splendid Suns"
3,I did finish it?,I think the book could have been better. I was as interested in finishing the book as the book was determined to end. On to the next one.
4,Not my Pick for Book Club!!,"My book club read this book and it was really an engaging page-turner! I initially thought it was going to be dull, but we all loved it. We are not super intense readers, but found this to be an easy read!"
5,Had been a long time...,It had been a long time since I cried from reading a novel.The story will stay with me for quite a while.
4,Appeals to a wide range of intellects,"This is a well-written novel. Intelligent readers will find it predictable, but worth reading nontheless. Less perceptive readers will be surprised, even shocked in places."
5,Infuriatingly Authentic,"Hosseini did a masterful job of showing us what's so beautiful about a country that we tend to think of as a pile of rubble. The vision of it's unique landscape and society, pre Soviet and pre Taliban opens a soft spot in the heart for Afghanistan. Unlike many, Hosseini has enough respect for the reader that (with some exceptions) he leaves us to piece together the big picture for ourselves. It is realistic in a very important sense - the sense that although redemption is always possible, sometimes it cannot be complete. It is thought provoking and is bound to stay with you for some time after you're finished. I'm told that this book was sold word of mouth which is inspiring in itself."
4,Great book,This book has a great story line. The author does a great job of placing you right beside all the characters. It is racy in some parts- only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.
4,happy with book,"This book was exactly as described, glad I got it. It was for my son's English Lit. class. I would order again."
4,Novel about friendship,"""The Kite Runner"" is a novel about two boys growing up in Kabul. The main character, Amir, is the son of a wealthy businessman; his closest friend is Hassan, the son of a servant serving Amir's house. Amir betrays Hassan and spends the rest of his life trying to redeem himself. A great novel. This is a good book for high school age and up. - Noga Rosenthal"
3,Page turner but .................,"A page turner basically because of the interest created by the historical and cultural information about Afghanistan, a country most of us know little about. Unfortunately the plot which holds the interest for a long while quickly becomes less and less credible when the main character returns to Afghanistan."
5,Compelling look at the heart,"""The Kite Flyer"" by Khaled Hosseini is a compelling story of love, friendship, class, betrayal, and the journey to redemption.The story takes place over a 30-year period and follows the life of a young Afghan man of wealth as his life crumbles when the Taliban takes power. But it is not a story of the Taliban. It is a story self-discovery and truth that could take place anywhere.You'll learn a good deal about Afghan life, and you'll recognize the universal frailities and strengths of being human."
5,Kite Runner,This was truly the best book I have ever read. The feelings that Hosseini captured were immeasureable. I found myself overcome with a feeling of sadness for the main character. Growing up in Iran helped for me to relate to the characters better and I have a new found appreciation for the Afganastani or Muslem people I see working at the gas stations or convenience stores knowing that they were different people in their countries.I recommend this book to absolutely everyone I see and I can't wait until Hosseini puts out his new book.
4,Almost a 5,"This book is hard to put down. Hosseini's characters are interesting, flawed and believable. I loved this book until the last few chapters. The means to redemption for the main character comes at the expense of believability. Too many coincidences, too many forced forced and contrived circumstances. But I still enjoyed it and think Hosseini is a talented writer."
3,Alternate reading,"It was interesting to read so many different takes on this book. Perhaps some of you would be willing to look at some of my realistic futuristic thriller novels such as Pluto 2550 or Adam 2552. Maybe you would love a modern political, men's adventure, romance, thriller unlike no other, which is my top selling novel, The Immortal. If you dare to see a close look at the paranormal or supernatural thrillers, you might enjoy Cast out of Paradise or Kevin and the Dead. An adventure in excitement waits for you. Incidentally, I am the author, Daniel Whittman. All of these novels and more are on amazon.com. [....]"
5,DITTO!,"I LOVED this book! Everyone that I have given this book to has absolutely loved it! It is a must read! I laughed, I cried, I was depressed...such a range of emotions and a lovely story. Ditto to all the praise this book has gotten, it is truly well deserved!"
5,A masterpiece,"This first novel of Khaled Hosseini is a true masterpiece. Every page of the Kite Runner brings with it an intense emotion or experience. The character development is hardy, heart-felt and truly beautiful...the plot has great twists and turns and even though I guessed a few events before the exact moment - the writing was so exquisite it kept me on the edge of my seat. The power of love in spite of profound betrayal is completely heartwrenching and moving.. one of the best novels of all time.Kate Nicoll, author of Soul Friends :Finding Healing with Animals"
5,"Superb, Thought Provoking","I had a hard time putting this book down, and an even harder time getting it out of my head. It is a story of friendship, betrayal, living with the consequences of your choices, and ultimately redemption, though not in a way one might think. The book portrays Afghanistan as it used to be, through the eyes of a child that grew up there. Parts are excruciating to read, just about anything that includes the atrocities of the Taliban would be. There were times I was just stunned by turns of events in the story."
5,The Kite Runner,I found this to be a beautifully written story. I was so moved by the storyline and curious about what was to unfold next that I completed it in less than 24 hours! I would highly recommend this and can't wait until the author's new novel due out soon.
2,Overrated,"First half was fascinating but the narrator's return to Afganistan was contrived-- like a hollywood movie. The half german, Taliban leader was an ill conceived character who is laughably evil. Ironies abound.Nothing rings true. Don't believe the hype. This book is strictly for people who consider subtlety boring and 'Crash' high art."
2,Perplexing effort,"I am perplexed at the acclaim and popular attention that this debut novel has received. The setting is very vivid and fresh, but the story sags and appears to read as if one was pulling mundane details from a diary. The novel tilts much too far to the descriptive, to the point where the writer himself fails to fully understand how far he has ventured into meaningless structure. One sentence just threw me for a loop and made me wonder if the critics were actually reading a different, better written edition of the novel. The beginning of one chapter starts, (I'm going from memory here, but the clumsiness is accurate), ""The dress she was wearing was a green dress."" Ah, this is high literature? Some of the other prose isn't far off."
4,Good read...,"I really liked this one. It was predictable, but was very interesting. I think that the description tells you what it is about, so if you are in for it, it is worth the read."
5,The Kite Runner - Awesome summer read!!!!!,"I picked this book up thinking it would be good, but from the beginning this book was nothing short of a great read. I literally couldn't put the book down and actually stayed up until 4 am finishing it in one day! This book really moved me and made me more aware of the beauty and possibility that was Afghanistan in the early 70's. This was sharply contrasted with the Afghanistan of the 90's and today. I would definately recommned this book and am sure that you will find it as interesting, engaging and incredible as I did."
5,Highly recommended!,The story of two boys in Afganistan with different social status whose lives are intertwined. The author paints such vivid descriptions that you almost feel you are walking the streets of Kabul with Amir and Hassan. There are surprising twists that only become apparent as the story plays out. This is a complelling book that you will find hard to put down. Highly recommended.
3,"Main character (Amir) is unlikable, predictable","The two redeeming qualities of the book are 1. the beginning (about Amir and Hassan's childhood) until the kite contest and 2. the backdrop of Afghanistan.*** Spoilers***Otherwise, I had to skip parts because it was so predictable (Houssein, hold up on the foreshadowing). I had to force myself to read about Amir. He just screwed up over and over again. It was a quick read, but the author really needs to work on character devlopment. The one redeeming thing Amir did in the book (fight for Sohrab and adopt him) was insufficient since Rahim basically set him up to do it anyways. And the whole INS part was not necessary. It was so easy to see that the boy would live with Amir after he saved him. DUH.This book is overrated and filled with too much of the shock factor. I'm surprised by all the fives."
2,Only worth half the money,"When I first started reading it, I thought I was reading something truly special. Compelling and absorbing, beautifully written, it was a book I didn't want to put down. But maybe a bit less than half way through, I thought the author lost his inspiration and drive. It was like he was just fabricating things to fill out the book and get it finished. It went from being deep and rich to being shallow and dull. Very frustrating and disappointing after such a promising start. I gave it the second star for the wonderful writing it started with."
3,Just Okay,"I'm a little puzzled by all the fabulous reviews about this book, too. The general plot is interesting, and timely, but the writing is certainly not top-notch. The writing style is inconsistent and at times clunky (for example, native Afghan children thinking of or using American idioms and slang), the character development is inconsistent and at times improbable, and the events of the book are meandering and at times without any point or contribution to the advancement of the plot. It seems like he isn't sure what voice to use in narrating the story. A lot happens yet it seems like nothing is happening. I enjoyed reading it, especially for the account of what life was like in Afghanistan, but I think A Thousand Splendid Suns is much better written."
4,A very nice read,"The Kite Runner was one of the best books I have read in the past couple of weeks. I have to give this author a break because he is a physician, this is his first novel and his first language is not English. Despite some flawed writing and repetition the story was compelling and some imagery was very nice. The story is about a young boy in Afghanistan beginning in the 1960s. The first part of the book was leisurely and lovely but he fast forwarded the end. I would recommend this book though because it helped me understand some of the events and issues in Afghanistan History. It really is a touching if disturbing story especially the delineation of the classes. If he writes another novel I would read it. He may improve and at least he shows great potential."
3,Not bad,"Well, I didn't purchase this book willingly - I don't think I would have chosen to read it - ever.While well written, with subtle irony and some interesting passages, the whole narrative seems absolutely contrived - old enemies meet again later in the novel, old friends reappear in fortuitious situations. The whole novel reads as though it were a bedtime story for a child, with the occasional twist thrown in for suspense.Don't take me wrong - it was a semi-enjoyable read, worth all 3 stars, but absolutely nothing extraordinary - certainly worth no more than said 3 stars."
5,I needed to know this.,"I'm fifty years old. My knowledge of history, from my education in the United States, ended after the commencement of World War I. It was limited to the western view of everything. I am so very ignorant. I need to know more. I need to understand my fellow man. As I read this book, evidently, I do. We're all the same. We're not as heroic as the people in this book. But, we aspire to be. Thank you, Mr. Hosseini, for this treasure. My little girl is now seeking her doctorate in Islamic and Arabic history. I thought she was crazy until I read this book. Now I know that she is completely bonkers. Thank you, Mr. Hosseini. Don't stop writing."
5,The Kite Runner,We read this book in our book club. All loved this book except 2 out of 10 people. I couldn't put this book down! A must read!
5,The best book I read this year,"...and I read a lot. The book didn't seem very interesting but I read the reviews here and finally picked it up. This is one of those books that entertain you and make you think. If you don't want this, turn on the network tv channels..."
5,Powerful yet readable,"So many people have commented on this book that I have little to add except that I put off reading it for so long because I thought it would be ""heavy"" or ""depressing"" or ""boring but good for me to read."" Well, it's not. It's a lovely, lyrical, moving, powerful story that is also a pleasure to read. It is NOT one of those books you force yourself to plow through because it's acclaimed."
4,The Kite Runner,Very engaging book - and I kept reading in hope that some good would come of the suffering and pain - a glimmer of hope eventually came - but only a glimmer.Good reality check for the reality of Afganistan and the results of our foreign policy.
4,Beautiful and eloquent,Beautiful and eloquent. Opens your eyes to the world around us. Give this book a try and you won't be disappointed.
5,"Sad, Gripping, Beautiful","I needed some new books to add to my summer reading and bought The Kite Runner solely based on the other reviews posted here. Once I began reading the book, it was so difficult to put it down. And when I had to put it down to tend to household chores, all I could think about was getting back to the story. It was gripping, difficult to swallow at times, especially the parts involving Assef and later the Taliban (again, Assef), but oh so beautifully written.It did leave me hungry for more, I want to hear more about Sohrab. I would enjoy reading another book by Khaled Hosseini about Sohrab, including some of the same story but all from Sohrab's perspective, and then how Sohrab evolves from the point where Kite Runner ends."
4,dramatically unforgettable.,"For me, ""The Kite Runner"" proved to be an intresting and almost historical experience. Sometimes this book was predictable but it consisted of an overall depth absorbed me into the story. I liked how well the author was able to narrate from a childs point-of-view without sounding unrealistic. His writing style is also very descriptive and, at times, poetic. Finally, I liked how the historical attributes of this novel give insight into a whole different part of the world. I recommend this book to anyone wants to read a beautiful, modern novel with real feelings and insight."
5,a book we should ALL read.,ITis book had been recommended to me several times. I had not read it because I was afraid it was going to be all about Afghanistan. It ended being about conciense. That is why we should all read something that makes us look inside ouselves and look at our good side and our bad. Yes Afghanisan is very importnat in this novel. Again you see what this country is about and not everything is the Taliban. There are educated and respectful kind people there who have truly suffered with the events that country has endured. We are priviledged and uncouncios about the hardships that exist in the world.
5,"Not an avid reader, but ended up loving this book","I hate reading books, but had to read this book in English 102 class. I really was not looking forward to it, but I found myself reading beyond the assigned chapters! I had a hard time putting this book down. It is well written which makes it easy to read. It really is agood book, and I loaned it to my mother-in-law (she is an avid reader) and she agrees with me."
5,Fantastic,I bought this book after reading the reviews. I loved every page and did not want it to end. I would love to read a sequel.
5,Touching,"This is one of the best books I believe I have ever read. I was given this book by a friend who knows I love to sit and read a good story, but I have never read anything about Muslim history. Especially with everthing that is going on in the Middle East, this helped me understand that the citizens of these countries are people with many deep rooted values, beliefs and very sad stories. Although it is a novel it sheds light on many culture issues that bring to light theie struggle. I read this book in one day, unable to put it down. Several times I cried while reading this book, being able to feel the pain for the main character and the best friend in the book. Very well written and I look forward to another bood by this author."
5,Brutal and beautiful story,"This intense, brutal and beautiful story is at times hard to read but always hard to put down. Amir's struggle for redemption showcases the horrors and triumphs of our humanity. This book is a must-read for any modern reader."
3,Great for the first 300 pages,The final 80 pages or so felt like the publisher just wanted to get the book to 400 pages and to have it done quickly. Disjointed writing and lost ideas make up the final parts of the book.The first 75% of the book is a solid five star.JMO.
5,WOW,"This is an excellent book. Very well written and intersting. First and foremost it reminds you that we have it great in America. The relationship between father & son and children from different classes sucks you in and changes your heart. It is a deep story, but a wonderful one."
1,By the number,"If you like sentimental stories that for every action has a corresponding reaction, this is the book for you. If you like character-driven novels, where reactions are driven by both the character and yes, chance, this is not for you."
5,Ended too Soon,A wonderful insight into what it was like long ago in Afghanistan. Very much want this book to go on longer.
5,You will Not Be disappointed,"One of the best books I've read in 2 or 3 years. Great and deep characters, wonderfully developed plot, hard to believe this is a first novel. Don't miss this book."
2,just because it takes place in Afghanistan doesn't make it good,"i found this book an easy, entertaining read -- but nothing more. The story is stereotypical -- Afghanistan as it was is barely described, although the book does a good job of portraying Afghanistan under the Taliban --but the characters were trite, the emotions shallow, and the plot oh-so-predictable..."
2,What a DOWNER,"In a good mood?? Hate that feeling?? Then read this book by all means. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)I'm not sure what the other reviews mean by ""a story of redemption"" The main character is a back-stabber who, although supposedly haunted by his past bad decisions, keeps making more bad decisions! He is interested in helping no one more than himself. I don't see where he ever succeeds on his own at anything. Living in Afghanistan in relative opulence?- thanks Dad! Leaving it?- thanks Dad! Getting his life saved?- thanks, Kid! Working out the adoption?-thanks relative in the INS! Oh yeah, he did succeed on his own at one thing- he turned that kid into a mute.Although well written and a quick read, I can't recommend this to anyone."
4,The Kite Runner,"this was a great book, but when it arrived at me house, the cover of the book was ripped and had a few pages that were damaged. It didn't look new, which is how I bought it."
1,not what i ordered,"The book is good in terms of the content, but when i ordered i ordered a hardcover in very good condition and instead i got a paperback in okay condition. not happy with what i received, but it is a good book to read. :("
1,hokey,i concur with those who are baffled by the volume of glowing reviews for this book. the plot was extremely contrived and thus completely hokey. don't waste your time.
1,I Got Through It!,"It wasn't a terrible no good book, but it was in no way really good and special either. I thought that Amir was a terrible person and I felt sorry he was so terrible, but I still can't quite understand his motives. He was so blessed, but he just didn't see it. That is why the book is so soap operaish and bad. It wasn't one of those books that really take you to the place and make you keep reading. It got better in the middle and by the end I had lost interest again as I listened to the story unfold very predictably. If you don't have to read it I'd say skip it and read some other book...there are millions more that are more worthy than this."
2,Just go see the movie...that's all the author wants anyway,"So I bought this book because of all the raving reviews and because I heard it was going to be released as a movie. I admit, when I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. But as the story developed and the chapters went on and on, I began to absolutely hate this book. No. I began to hate this author. It just seemed like the author wrote this book just so it would be made into the movie. The storyline, characters, setting, descriptions...everything was toooo perfect. Don't get me wrong, the story was great, but I just didn't feel ANY passion from the author. Like he really didn't love this book. And if an author doesn't love his own work, how is anyone else supposed to. I know I must be wrong because hundreds of you RAVED about this book. It just seemed like a total gimmick to me and I'll never read anything else by Khaled Hosseini."
3,A Solid Effort From A First Time Novelist,I truly enjoyed the way the author envelopes the reader in the entire world that is pre-Taliban and some of Taliban Afghanistan. From the cuisine to every aspect of the bourgeoisie half of the culture one is able to soak up a good amount of what life was like back then. The author's greatest strength is his dialog and his ability to invoke simultaneous sympathy and revulsion in the reader for the main character/narrator. I was mostly disappointed with the actual kite-flying accounts that involved more telling than showing. The final act of the book is the weakest as it requires a lot of suspension of disbelief because the author ties up all his loose ends very neatly with the antagonist coming back into the story for a final cinematic blowout. (This book's film rights were probably optioned quicker than a New York minute).
5,My review of Kite Runner,"I'm probably one of the few people who didn't buy this book because it was on the bestseller list. I bought it as a fluke and was simply amazed at the great quality of writing. The story is like no other and not a simple one, but each page will keep you riveted and you'll find it hard to put down. Spanning several decades and with a host of colorful characters, this book is by far one of the best things I've come across, ever!"
5,A Wonderful Book I Couldn't Put Down,"This is one of those rare yet extraordinary books that is destined to become a classic. Written with a lot of heart, the characters are all too human, going thrrough so much, and each chapter makes you want to read the next. It's a fabulous book, one of the best novels I've read in a long time!"
4,The Kite Runner,"Mostly in the style of modern literature influentiated by the media, this is, to my opinion, straight language although sometimes poor, like if you were reading a newspaper or a screen play.The story is very touching and a good help to remind us that countries like Afghanistan were not always impoverished as they're nowadays.Characters are perfectly defined and by using a plain language, Mr. Hosseini offers us a quick, easy and clear reading helping us to manage all the deep feelings moving around in this novel."
4,A tale worthy of Dickens,"Khaled Hossein spins a tale worthy of Charles Dickens. As I read The Kite Runner I was reminded of the stories David Copperfield and A Tale of Two Cities. The first because of the person propose and decades long story line. The second because the situation becomes dangerous for the protagonist when he travels back home.Hossein, however, avoids the flowery language and odd analogies of Dickens. Instead he writes in a more direct style reminiscient of Hemmingway.Did I just do that? Did I compare a first novel to Dickens and Hemmingway. How cliche'. Needless to say, I enjoyed the book and recommend it. And don't let Hossein's Afghan roots fool you, the book it definately written from an American point of view.[...]"
3,Rough Sailing in Spots,"While this is a quick and easy read, ""The Kite Runner"" story line is interesting; however, the language is rough in spots. This base language could have been edited out with no compromise to the interesting tale of two friends whose lives have taken vastly different turns."
4,An interesting book,"I read this book with great interest after hearing my friends rave about it. It did not disappoint. Written in a very simple style the story pulls you in from the first page. It is a well crafted book, but at times it is a bit too well-crafted, predictably so: perhaps the writer went to a writing workshop or had an editor who went to one. Still, a moving story, simply told, one that deserves to be this widely read."
3,Deliberate,"The best I can say it that the Kite Runner is an enjoyable read. However, the book is so deliberately framed that upon completing the final page the plot has been smashed into your skull ad nauseum. The reader is reminded of the need for redemption constantly and the full-circle arc is painfully obvious. The so-called twists can be seen far in advance; subtlety is not a suit this book wears. Many of the situations seemed forced and contrived. In the end, it reads fast and while definitely not a classic, it is an average flavor of the month.Perhaps I am not giving Hosseini enough credit. He even says in the book that afhgans are interested more in the ending than the plot. Maybe that is what drives the unsubtle nature of the book. If true, he might just be a master of subtlety. That notwithstanding, the novel is still too deliberate."
3,Review of The Kite Runner,The plot line of this novel is AMAZING however the author chooses at times to bludgeon us with language at the moments when he should pull back and let the horror of what he's describing speak for itself. Especially at the conclusion whichis the coincidence of all coincidences - I almost ended the book early as the writing fell apart and was so melodramatic. Howver the descriptions of daily life are vivid and sensitive and I recommend the book for this alone.
5,"One absorbing read...from a ""non-reader"" (at least like you all!)","I am not one who reads a lot....BUT when I do it is usually because I have found something so absorbing and riveting that I simply can't put it down.Why should I review the plot when everyone else at Amazon seems to be arguing about it.So, I will say adieu with ,""This is is single most vividly- written -easy -to-read -and -quick -to -feel -emotion -novel"" that I have ever enjoyed .That's all....can't wait for the movie, which is usually my forte."
4,Book club read,"My book club decided to read this compelling story for our September meeting. Amazing storyline and great for discussion.And while I have recommended it to a few people, I would be cautious. It is definately a wonderful glimpse into pre-Russian invasion through Taliban control through the eyes of a young man growing up. Also shows a non-radical Muslim life. Be warned this book does have very strong scenes that are disturbing (part of the story not gratuitous). Most of the scenes are very well written without being completely graphic.A wonderful first book from this author. And an excellent choice for a book club or discussion group."
5,Best read of 2007,"The Kite Runner is probably the best book I've read in 2007. The story telling is masterful and captivating. It is a book that is impossible to put down. The tale of Amir, Hassan, and Sohrab is traggic, hopeful, and one of redemption. A must read."
4,Wonderfully moving tale of loyalty and duty,"I loved this book until about the next to last chapter (don't worry, no spoilers here). Several things happen in rapid succession at the end of the novel. Most of them are exciting and harrowing and understandable and sickening and wonderful, BUT I feel the author should have taken his time with this part of the book. The first 3/4 of the book was so smooth and deft but it seems like he ran out of pages and rushed through the last 1/4. It doesn't taken away from the importance of the strory or the brutality or the wonder. I just wish the author's lyrical quality was continued through the end."
5,Emotional,The Kite Runner has a plot that is fabulously woven together between cultures and countries. In-depth character development always makes for a great book. I yearned to fight kites and try to catch the kite that is cut. I felt I could see the Afghan way of life and their land. I could feel the emotion or lack there of as needed by the characters. This is another book that had me captured from the beginning and wanting more.
5,Awesome story telling with lots of twists,"I loved this story. It is well written and kept me very interested. I could hardly put it down. The story itself is realistic in a way that's not predictable and at the same time down to earth. The emotions seem very real and the way that children see the world and how we grow into who we are as adults-I was so impressed. Definately would recommend this book. It also softens your heart to the plight and people of Afghanistan. The people that live there hate the Taliban as much and probably more so than we do. I actually learned a lot about the culture from this book. Also the book itself, this version, is very nice. The pages are pretty and the illustrations add a lot to the character."
2,I Must Have Missed Something,"I heard a lot about this book and was anxious and excited to read it. I found it to have way too much talking and not enough action for me. I gave this book a lot of chances and stuck with it when I felt like giving up on it, but it just never did it for me. The first 100 pages or so are okay, but then I became confused and bored. I never felt any connection to the characters at all.--Gerard Zemek, husband of author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
5,"Disturbing, yet inspiring and triumphant!","I read this book in 24 hours, squeezing in every sentence until I had the time to sit and consume the whole masterpiece. There was a twist or turn in every chapter. It literally had me in it's grips and I had to know how it ended.It's hard to say that one could ""love"" this story for it told of many heartbreaking lossess, but it was moving beyond words for me and demostrated a man who redeemed his mistakes in the end."
4,Sad and powerful,"Growing up in Afghanistan, Amir (the main character, written in first person form) endures ethnic and religious struggles and also the Russian invasion. I have to wonder...did the author play part of the role? A sad and powerful novel.Because of the strife in his homeland Amir moves to America as a young man in the 1980's. A phone call from the past brought him back to his childhood in 1970's Afghanistan, to the days of kite running (fighting). He was heavily influenced by his father and best friend. He goes back to his home country to reconcile mistakes and fill a gap at home, but a past betrayal eats at him. The Taliban takes over his country and he experiences their fist first hand.The Koran and Muslim worship are interjected, but are very light; it is not a problem. The novel raises many ethical and moral questions.Wish you wellScott"
3,"Great story, sappy writing","The tale of guilt-ridden childhood in Afghanistan's darkest hour is captivating. Hosseini overgilds some of the story's finest moments with drippy writing and over-wrought phrases. Still it is a worthwhile book on several levels: politics, family obligations, honor, culture clash. If not for the candy-coated passages I would have awarded it four stars."
3,schizophrenic prose,"The first half of this book was an excellent piece of prose and an involving story. However, when the story returns to Afghanistan both the prose and the story fell off the table. I can only assume that the publishers said ""Finish this book in 2 weeks and we promise you a movie contract."" Fortunately, the author only temporarily betrayed his considerable talent. ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" sees him return to his appreciative readers.Be prepared to abandon this book near the half-way point."
4,the destruction of Afghanistan as reflected in a family melodrama,"'The Kite Runner' is certainly an interesting read. It is written as if were a memoir by a man recounting his boyhood in Kabul in the 1970s and how his past catches up with him twenty years later while living in California. So convincing is this memoir format that I had to keep reminding myself 'The Kite Runner' is indeed fiction. Although the story itself is immensely readable and oftentimes heartwarming, tragic or downright horrific, ultimately the author overcooks it a bit; the story grows to become somewhat unrealistic. On the other hand the author does a masterful job in describing life in Kabul during very turbulent years and he educates the reader on various Afghan customs and prejudices.Bottom line: entertaining and educational. Strongly recommended."
5,Kite Runner,"Sad story, but very well written, particularly for a ""first"" book. The book was insightful and gave me a birds eye view of how others live."
5,A wonderful treat in literature.,"There is a lot covered in The Kite Runner which spans roughly 40 years. And it reaches every emotion. As a child, Amir, makes a poor decision to leave his friend while being attacked, but 30 years later he finds redemption for that heartless act as a child. The characters, descriptions, and plot are all very well done. There are so many reviews that I don't need to go into detail - what more can I say that hasn't been said already? It is a great book and you will enjoy it. I would also recommendA Thousand Splendid Sunsas it is another marvelous achievement in literature."
5,"""It pulls at your heartstrings""","Love, forgiveness, and loyalty among friends, rare ocurrences in our narcissistic society are the attributes that make this phenomenal book so difficult to put down. A best seller in its own right ""The Kite Runner"" proves once again that good quality novels don't have to be written by celebrities to remain in the Amazon's best seller's list for years. Fortunately, the discerning reader still has the last word.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
1,KITE RUNNER,"ALTHOUGH IN THE END ONE CAN APPRECIATE THE PURGING THE AUTHOR WENT THROUGH TO TRY TO ATONE FOR HIS SINS, STILL THE GORE, THE BASE DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH TERRIBLE ACTS THAT WENT ON DOES NOT FOR ME ATONE FOR THE BOOK'S WORTH.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE TO DARKEN THEIR MINDS; IN FACT, WE HAVE THROWN THE BOOK AWAY---I WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE IT TO THE LIBRARY. JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!HELEN W WELLS"
2,a big disappointment,"while glimpses of a different culture were interesting, the protagonist (at least of the first 100 plus pages - which was all I could read) was such an unpleasant (as well as unhappy) boy, that I just couldn't care what happened to him - and didn't want to learn more."
1,"If the narrator wasn't so Horrible, it might have been good for 14 year olds.","I don't get it at all! A teenager would write better prose... The story is sooo predictable and the narrator... don't let me get started! He is such a spoiled brat throughout his life, an incredible egomaniac and he is not even aware of that. It's not like it's a choice to have a jerk for a narrator, because he keeps trying to justify his actions by explaining ""reasons"" for them! Yeah there's a reason: that he's the epitome of spoilbrattedness! Nothing redeems him in my eyes. I hated him!"
2,Mundane is insane,"Afghanistan schmanistan. Where are the evil sorcerors and elves? I don't see any orc armies! Like dude, man! Why did you write about THIS world? You know? I don't see any love between an elf and a Bardic fighter! California? That's your final destination? I was waiting for you to wisk off the guilt ridden toad of a son to Nargalon. Poor little human! Trapped in a world of disease and industry. No magic spells of flight and invisibility here. Dad croaks, and I'm still waiting for the demon Balthazor to announce his wicked presence. Dude, you be illin'. I give it 2 stars because somehow I made it through the whole thing (obviously)."
1,Yuck!,Left me feeling sick inside from beginning to end. The main character is so unlikable. It may have some insight into the sick ways of afghani people but overall sucked. I have no idea why so many people recomend such a depressing and unrewarding book.
2,THE bottom line,"I did not like this book at all PERIOD. here is the bottom line why i did not like this book _ but really COMMA, this book is sad, cliche'd, and by being cliche'd gets repetetive fast. Some might call this foreshadowing. I call it lack of creativity and wanting some poor joe to think ur smart because they think you put ""foreshadowing"" in the book. The book isnt sad its downright suicidal, mayB not quite that bad, but still. Heres why its sad: EVERYONE GETS RAPED!!! And then children slit wrists with razors. I this this Khaled man is a sicko! If i want to get depressed i can turn on the news for Heaven's sake. BY GOTT MAKE IT STOP"
1,Terrible Horrible,HorribleNever buy this bookThe worstIt is a waste of moneyAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,A good first book,"The Kite Runner starts out well and absorbed me. There are two stories; that of Baba and the other, less compelling and Hollywood-like, that of Sohrab. Baba's story is more compelling and believable. With his death, which happens about half-way through the novel, the author could have closed the story and it would have been a tighter one. His wandering back in to the Taliban-infested Afghanistan and his daredevil, truly incredible duel with Asseff are Bollywood/Lollywood stuff that is almost replusive.I still rate this book an OK one to read, not bad for a first novel. At times it reads like a screenplay - may be the author had something more in mind!"
5,Blood is thicker than water,"Although it is a somber story, it made me realize the power and importance of family. Being a woman I particularly appreciate learning about the bonds between father and son, which is seldom focused on in our society. Through this novel, you will perhaps begin to understand what has been done to Afghani people and find compassion in your heart for them. You will also witness the inhumanity and cruelty that life can deliver and the power of love and compassion than always wins in the end. I urge you to discover the metaphor behind the phrase ""the kite runner"". You'll be happy that you did."
3,Read with Caution,"I agree with the vast majority of reviewers that this is an excellent novel - unique, well-written, and haunting. There is no reason for me to reiterate the praises. I am writing this review simply to warn people with delicate sensibilities like mine to be forewarned before buying this book: the ""terrible incident"" everyone refers to is the brutal rape of a young boy by a pack of sociopathic, privileged teens. Perhaps because I am the mother of a young boy, I found the scene totally gut-wrenching and utterly horrible. I couldn't finish the book. So, my point is simple: don't read the book if you might be upset by a graphic description of the rape of a young, sweet boy."
3,A picture of self-redemption,"For those interested in themes, the story is about a man who did some cruel things to his childhood friend and then, as an adult tormented by his past demons, he seeks to save his soul by rescuing the orphaned son of that old friend. His journey makes him encounter various past demons at different points as there are many obstacles for him to overcome. The Karma like feel about the plot seemed more in keeping with a Hindu author than a Muslim, but there you go.And, that's about it. The book is well written. It has a somewhat enchanting feel; made me want to see Afghanastan in its former glory."
5,Great buy and read,"The price is great and the book is so captivating, I could hardly put it down. It's heartbreakingly beautiful and touching story of Afganistan people and their culture. I bought it for my friend and would recommend it to anyone! I also bought his next book, A Thousand Splendid Suns, can't wait to read it."
3,uneven,"I greatly enjoyed the first third of this book--the narrator as a boy in Afghanistan. There, Hosseini does a fine job of showing Afghan life, and in conveying the uncertainties, jealousies and joys of growing up.But when the story shifted to America, Hosseini traded authenticity for melodrama--employing cheap, predictable plot devices from (or for) a mediocre Hollywood movie. I won't give away the story, but the utterly contrived ""coincidences"" had me shaking my head. The ending was nicely done, but couldn't rescue what came before."
4,Emerging Courage,"This is a story about behavior molded and forced by tradition, yearning, realtionships and uncontrollable life events. Conscience is secondary to need until love triumphs; courage is absent until deadly consequence promises to be less painful than failure. Events guide toward reflection and change. The inability of youth to analyze or understand rings true, and the priceless ability to evolve through experiences is clear. Afghanistan was given life in the heart of this reader. Unconditional love and understanding without judgement is the key that opens the door of the heart."
5,Blue,"This book touched me very deeply. I had read A Thousand Splendid Sun's before and both left me thoughtful. I now find myself yearning to visit Afghanistan. Both of Hosseini`s books brought me confusion, comfort and self awareness. These boos will never leave me."
5,It'll take a little piece of your heart!,"I find a read a novel and 9 times out of 10 I have basically forgotten about it within weeks ,but this one,this one , I think I will remember until the day I die ! Absolutely amazing story-telling !"
3,"Worth the Read but not a ""great"" book by any means.","I read this book in less than 2 days, so it was a really quick and easy read. It's a good book that flows nicely; however, I felt that all the foreshadowing, symbolism, and irony seemed trite, contrived, predictable, and obvious - almost to the point of being insulting.That being said, it is a book worth reading and overall a has good and sometimes thought provoking story, but I definitely would not say it is anywhere near ""great""."
3,"Ordinary, not Extraordinary","This book simply does not live up to the hype. The evocative, lyrical first half disintegrates rapidly into a contrived melodrama and the reader ends up feeling cheated in a bait-and-switch. Those looking for a similar but far better book should pick up ""Shantaram"" by Roberts."
3,so so,neither good nor bad. i found the first half a little slow in building the plot while the second half was more enjoyable.
4,"worth reading, lives up to the hype.",i resisted reading this because i feared it was overpraised and too commercial. i was wrong. i found it moving and well told. don't miss it.
3,"""The Kite Runner"" - A depressing tale.-","The Kite Runner.-It is an excellent entertaining novel.But, it is neither for the lover of the historic facts nor for the critical observer of the sociologic aspects of the situations exploited. The sensitive tale painfully exposes the elements of a culture not well understood in America, where the values of human life and human rights practically do not exist. The book IS NOT about religious values or theological differences, but the book somehow tries to expose politics, violence, or personal interests disguised as religious principles. It is entertaining, if you desire to be depressed, go ahead and read the book, but if you are trying to obtain some valuable information out of this tale read something else or watch some TV program about Afghanistan or Pakistan."
4,Brilliant debut novel,"Khaled Hosseini takes readers inside Afghanistan & makes us feel like we're there. It's a briliant, heart-breaking novel. Kite Runner is part novel, part political history & part suspense. Read it."
3,A topnotch story that grabs your heart.,"This is a wonderful story about love and pain, loyality, betrayal,guilt and redemption. Along the way you learn a lot about the culture and history of Afghanistan. One of the best books I have read in a long time."
5,Simply Amazing,"This book is very well written. Some parts may be a little disturbing to young readers, but it is not something that should stop you from reading the book. what happens actually makes the story more interesting. This book has an excellent ending, and reads fast. It always keeps you reading, and never bores you out of continuing onto the next page.thank you for your time,Loran"
5,So many reviews it seems meaningless to add to them,"So many reviews, but for people who watch my reviews, I feel obligated to add another. This riveting book with its complex yet believable plot is one of the best studies in the nature of sin, guilt and believe one can read. From the bigger-than-life father to whom sin at its root is lies, to the son's guilt based on cowardice, to the servants' quiet display of self-confident, natural morality/dignity this novel shows the sin-guilt-belief problem to be universal. In this novel it is played out in an Islamic/Afghani/American stage - the uncommon Afghani backdrop while particularizing the specifics of the story, only adds to the recognition that the problem is universal. Consider this a must read novel."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"This is a great work of fiction, vivid in its detail and compelling in its story. It is one of my favorite books of all time. Up there with A Fine Balance and Life of Pi!"
4,Good read,"I agree with a lot of the poor reviews (they're just more fun to read aren't they) in that the main character is extremely unlikeable and just a brat, but I found this interesting in that it made you think of Afganistan differently. If a book sounds interesting to you, read it, regardless of reviews."
4,Magical book,"Loved this book - it takes you away into another world - wonderful. Having said that one of the later twists of the plot is a little forced in my view - too constructed, but overall a very satisfying read."
3,The author has watched too many Indian (Hindi) movies,The Kite runner is entertaining and is written in a simple language. However the generosity/loyalty depicted in the book and the chains of coincidences that happen with the Author seem to have taken a lot of inspiration from Hindi ( Indian movies --Hindi movies). From entertainment perspective it is a good read. It seems like fiction is nicely marinated with facts.
3,"Good, but not Great","I'm obviously in the minority, but I was disappointed with this book. The descriptions of life in Afghanistan were interesting, but I found the flashbacks to childhood experiences distracting, there were too many of them.Much of the story was predictable and other, significant events were just too unbelievable--the times this man chose to fall asleep...!I guess I'm a wimp, but in my opinion, there was too much violence in the book. I haven't a lot of time for leisure reading, and I don't care to spend it with stonings, rapes and child abuse."
1,So this is it?,"I looked forward to reading this novel with all the glowing reviews but in retrospect I wish I had paid more attention to the 1 star reviews. They were 100% right.There is not a single aspect of this novel I can recommend. The writing is ordinary, nothing exceptional at all. The storytelling? It's like reading the newspaper, flat and uninteresting. The story itself? Ok, there are a few interesting scenes, some shocking ones, too, but most of the book goes nowhere, even when it is covering years and decades, which is a neat trick. It has no energy whatsoever.One of the very worst novels I have read in a long long time."
2,Amateurish and unsophisticated,"This book had come highly recommended to me by several people, and as you can see, the reviews are glowing. Personally, I couldn't get through it. If I hadn't heard that it was a first novel, I would have soon figured that out, as the writing is so irritatingly, distractingly amateurish. I understand that English is not the author's native language, but my issues with the writing were not so much style as content - such as being beaten over the head with certain points (I get it, I get it!). Then there's the main character. I don't need for a character to be ""good"" to care what happens to him, but he must be interesting. This guy? I just didn't care. If you're enchanted by the Middle Eastern setting, there is plenty of wonderful literature in translation from this region. Or, for some other social, political or historical perspective, you might dip into the wealth of nonfiction available. Unless you're big on the bestseller/Oprah stuff, don't waste your time with this."
2,Overhyped and predictable,"As much as I enjoyed the eloquent writing, the story line was way overhyped and predictable. There was nothing remotely unique here if you have lived in poorer countries. Other than the author tried to make a hollywood story out of it. I cannot recommend this.Save your $14 and donate that to CARE."
3,A generous 3,"I expected much more from Kite Runner, given raving reviews all over. Perhaps given these high expectations, I was ultimately very disappointed by the book. Emblematic of this is the story's denoument, when tension is meant to be at a maximum, and the suspense revolves around the bureaucratic hurdles of immigration into the US. Amir's transformation from recent emigré to succesful author in America implies Nabokovian talent for writing in non-native tongue. Another highly implausible incident is the incident wherein Amir learns about his mother from a beggar in Kabul - the coincidence is so incredibly farfetched Hosseini feels he need justify it as an example of Afghan culture.My overall conclusion is that Kite Runner is a ""lightweight"" novel that earned ""heavyweight"" reviews. For a more powerful book on Afghanistan try Philip Henschers ""The Mulberry Empire""."
5,The Kite Runner,"This book is the best book I have ever read. I am 20 years old and I had to read it for my english 1102 class and I am so glad I did. this book tuches every emotion! I laighted, cried, got mad and just loved this book. everyone should read it!"
3,A good read,"I would actually give this book 3 1/2 stars but that was not an option.I couldn't tell if the book was written in another language and translated into English or if it was written in English. Regardless, the book was written in a manner that suggested that the author's primary language was not English. In addition, much of the plot was contrived. Having said that, this is a very moving story with a wonderful incite into the Afhgani culture. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to understand the gulfs (and similarities) between our (American) culture and theirs."
3,An entertaining story,"While some parts were predictable, it was very interesting and engrossing. I HATED the protagonist and could not believe he could behave so cowardly, but had to remind myself that I have never had to walk in his shoes. . . a very interesting fictional illustration of the multiplicities of segregation and hatreds in these areas."
5,A Moving escape to another life and time,"This book was so good that I cant seem to think about reading another one yet. It is still digesting in my heart and I think about the characters almost daily. So rare that a book can do that to me. Although the book had some parts that were tough to read, I found I couldnt put it down. A favorite for sure!! It is already making the rounds to my friends. A STORY I WILL NEVER FORGET."
2,Amir is shallow and arrogant and unlikeable,"I was looking forward to this book and chose it for my book club, but am very disappointed in the book. I really disliked the main character and narrator, named Amir. And he is there from the beginning to the end, you get no relief. What an unlikeable, shallow, arrogant, superficial, childish NOTHING who caused everyone pain. I thought he might show some redeeming quality, but no, he was pathetic to the very end. We only know the other characters through the eyes of this awful man, so therefore the other characters are not well developed.I did like that it showed some about Afghanistan, the scenery, customs, food, language. Poor Afghanistan - my heart goes out to the people there."
3,Disappointed,"After all of the stellar reviews of this book, I could not wait to finally crack it open. However, I found it to be mundane at best. I kept reading in the hopes that it would get more interesting. It didn't. It was well written, but not anything spectacular."
5,I found this book riveting,"I'm the author of four books, but when I read The Kite Runner, I found myself not wanting to tell anyone about my books - because they are not literary works of art, like THE KITE RUNNER. My husband saw me reading this book or devouring it, and he picked it up after I was through, and like me, could not put it down. mr. Hosseini is responsible for several nights missed sleep in our home. The Kite Runner was riveting."
5,fascinating and compelling,"THE KITE RUNNER is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Everything from the novel's setting, to the characterizations, to the almost-expected yet still surprising plot twists, to the heart-breaking emotional relationships at the core, all taken together made this an extremely powerful reading experience. The fact that the story encompasses 30 years of modern history in Afghanistan makes it interesting enough, but the complexity of Amir's relationships with his father, his boyhood friend, the various characters who weave in and out of his life, and most importantly with himself, makes this book a true treasure.If you've been hesitating on buying this book, don't wait any longer. Just get yourself a copy and plan to stay up until the wee hours of the morning until you've finished reading the story of the kite runner."
5,Great read,This was an excellent book! I have been recommending it to anyone I know who likes to read. It is particularly relevent in these times. The story humanizes the Muslim world for those of us who are unfamiliar with it. The story is riveting and the book is hard to put down once you begin. Great book for the beach!
5,A beautifully written novel,"My best friend insisted I read ""The Kite Runner"". Now -- I insist that you do the same. This is one the finest books I have ever read. It has forever impacted the way I view the Middle East and its people.A beautifully crafted novel with characters that will fill you with a range of emotions. Please, read this book."
5,"Could not put it down from Chapter 1, excellent!","I have not read a book as good as The Kite Runner in a very long time. Tears streamed down my face many times but in the end, I felt uplifted and hopeful. This is a story of family and of love, as well as a look into the disturbing turmoil in Afghanistan. Get this book, read it, and share it with family and friends."
3,Warning,"This book was on a reading list for my kids' school. Although a compelling book from an adult point, it has subject matter which may be inappropriate for young teens (homosexual rape, pediphilia, etc.). I'd highly recommend a parent read this book so you will be prepared to discuss these issues, or to decide for yourself if your child is able to handle the content. The book has merit, but you need to decide if the events in the book overshadow its merits."
4,An interesting study on human nature,"I read this book knowing nothing about it. The author satisfied me by providing just enough history and insight into the main character to understand his flaws. I found myself unable to put the book down, waiting and willing for the protaganist to ""do the right thing."" Multidimentional characters and vivid setting decriptions contributed to making this a great read. Not a classic, but definitely worthwhile."
5,Couldn't put it down.,"Hosseini writes beautifully, simply, and elegantly, and is a master at storytelling. The story is well-woven, gripping, and haunting, long after you have finished reading the book.Beyond the beautiful prose, however, I particularly enjoyed this book because of its accurate, poignant description of the immigrant experience, and the toll of war. It is every immigrant's story. My family immigrated from the middle east almost 30 years ago. Former doctors, lawyers, and wealthy businessmen who lived all their lives with chauffers and servants dropped everything, came to the U.S., and had to struggle just to make ends meet. Hosseini's portrayal of immigrants coming from a place where everyone knew and respected them, and being plopped in a country where they are nobodies, do not speak the language, and have to start at the bottom was all too familiar."
1,What a waste of time!!,"I read this book for my book club, and I was really looking forward to reading it, having heard so much praise for it.The book is awful. The story is boring and entirely predictable, the coincidences are simply too many and beggar belief, the characters are all shallow and not a single one has been developed to any degree of complexity.What astounded me were the numerous grammatical errors that litter the book. I started to mark them in red, but eventually I had to stop making corrections, or else I would never have finished the book. Just what did the proofreaders of this book do? Perhaps they fell asleep reading it, as I came very close to doing.Diane Sawyer is listed on the back cover as one of the reviewers, and that should tell serious readers all they need to know."
1,Crazy ebook price!,The Kindle version of this book is $3 more expensive than the paperback! How does this make sense? This new pricing scheme kills the Kindle. I wish I hadn't bought my Kindle...
3,Good Start - Weak Finish,"This book was a big sensation among my friends and I was a believer until about page 80. Then, I started to get frustrated with the coincidences, fifth-grade level foreshadowing and wholly implausible situations. Frankly, it lacked the nuance and depth of the initial chapters. It was a good effort and worth the read, but fairly juvenile in terms of literary level. Hosseini is good at describing the day-to-day, but larger plot elements lack originality. The liberal use of Afghan words seems forced and distracting."
4,amir and hassan in the kite runner,"The most interesting things about ""The Kite Runner"" are the characters. Why is Amir so heartless? And why is Hassan so unboundedly good? Despite everything we learn throughout the book, nothing truly explains how Amir can be so self-centered, so unmoved by the best friend he will ever have. And no matter what we learn throughout the book, nothing really changes our impression of Hassan: that he is just one of those amazingly good people who is unbelievably loving and kind towards those he loves, despite the bad treatment from them he sometimes receives. Even after one puts the book down, when we are glad Amir finally does something for the good of someone other than himself, we know he also did it to assuage his own guilt. Yet we know that regardless of his reasons, he did the one thing that would matter more than anything to Hassan-because there's no greater way to show love to someone than to treat their children lovingly and kindly."
5,Powerful!,"Mr. Hosseini has an incredible gift for story-telling. Once I started reading it, I could not put the book down. He has given me a whole new perspective and understanding about Afghanistan, her people and what has happened over there. I say, ""Hurrah"" to him for making us more aware of the struggle and violence that the people have lived with for so long!"
2,Very Disappointing,"Wow, what a disappointment. I had read such great reviews about this book and seen it on so many top ten lists. I expected a tale rich with the Afghan heritage and culture. While this was the backdrop, the story was really more about a barbaric psychopath, a pathetic and self-pitying protagonist and grossly unnecessary cruelty (to children nonetheless). A truly good novelist should be able to move the reader without resorting to multiple accounts of child sodomy, brutal murders of beloved characters and horrific accounts of torture and senseless betrayal. In the end, this book is just manipulative with its contrived plotline and characters. I say skip it -- there are so many better reads out there."
2,Overly long,"The book's plot is very good. The problem is to find it and when you can't find it quickly enough you'll have a dull reading. The last chapter you can read it or not because you'll know how the book'd end. The book has too many wasted pages e.g. How many pages do you need to explain a kite tournament? Maybe 15? Another example is why Amir went to draw a Visa for Sohrab and spent 2 days and 40 pages to get nowhere if his neighbor worked in an INS office? If you want to read an excellent book with the plot akin read: ""The Bandit Queen of India"" by Phoolan Devi"
5,Special delivery,"This nearly-a-memoir is lovingly constructed, tactfully testy at times, and can be slightly jarring. It is not a pink fuzzy feel good book, and it should not be. It is what it is, and it's good! I did not want to stop reading, and when I finished reading I was pleased to catch a re-televised discussion with Khaled Hosseini at a Virginia college. The auther delivers, and delivers well!"
5,Kite Runner is Wicked,This was the best book i read in 2004. I'm usually a Tom Clancy fan and my wife gave me this book on our vacation and i couldn't put it down.
5,This was a hard book,"There were times I hated reading this book. I went days feeling physcially sick from the story. But the writing and tale are perfectly written. Not a word too few or two many. Its a brilliant book - but not always an enjoyable one. I've read hundreds of book and this was, without a doubt, one the best written books I've ever encountered."
4,Excellent Book Overall,"I was required to read this book for a Global Studies course and thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is very interesting and has unexpected twists to the plot that you wouldn't expect. I highly recommend the book to anyone over the age of 14 who is okay with some graphic content (after all the book is based on real events in the author's life.) The only part that I found a little boring was the middle portion of the book; the first part is about the narrator's childhood, while the third part occurs in somewhat present-day. The second part, however, comes off as a ""soap-opera"" (like marriage, cancer battles, etc.) All in all this is probably the best book I've read all year, save for To Kill a Mockingbird."
5,Excellent Book!,"I picked up this book on a whim. Had never heard of the author before. This book brought out so many emotions as I read it. It is unlike nothing I have read before. I recommend this to anyone who pretty much reads the same ""type"" of books and wants to try something different. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Breathtaking,"Brilliantly crafted and painfully emotional, Khaled Hosseini's first book will take your breath away. You'll fly through the pages and find that you reach the end too soon. It'll make you laugh, cry, and gasp out in disbelief. It's definitely a must-read."
3,Interesting but Depressing,"I enjoyed being emersed into another culture. I found the characteres interesting and was captivated by their relationships. It was, however, very depressing. I understand it is not meant to be a ""feel good"" book, but is it too much to ask for some peaks and valleys? Every time something bad would happen, the characters had no time to recover before they were knocked down again. I was somewhat reminded of the Series of Unfortunate Events and I found myself motivated to continue reading in hope that something good would happen. I was disappointed in the end. I recommend that you read this book to satisfy your curiosity, but don't get caught up in the hype. It's a bit overrated."
3,"No doubt it's a good book, but...","No doubt it's a good book, but I just don't get why the HUGE sales and why all the fuzz... COmpetent, cleverly written, but not at all better than hundreds of book of this kind (narrated in first person, tragedy, loss, the narrator being a flawed person, etc, etc...). Anyway, congratulations to the writer, who found success with a simple and resonating story."
5,"Great book, easy read","I couldn't put this book down. I was invited into a suprising world in Afghanistan that I didn't know existed. Afghanistan was once a beautiful place, I found myself in a world of family, friends and loyalty. The relationship between the main character and his father is so compeling. It made me look at my relationship with my own father. This book also gave me a renewed appreciation for my husband who was born in Asia. We have 2 boys and I can see his relationship with our sons reflected in this book.A great read."
5,"Gripping, well crafted tale","This was a great story with an excellent plot and character development. It's a book that might keep you up past your bedtime to finish. It's the best story involving Afghanistan since the non-fiction book ""An Unexpected Light"" by Jason Elliot."
5,A story as dramatic as the land it is about.,"'The Kite Runner' is the best book I have read in years. Although parts of the book were physically painful to read, the end result was a great work of love and redemption. I generally don't care for characters who are quite so spineless but I was able to identify with Amir and ultimately learned something about myself in the process.Hosseini provides great insight into the relationship between sons and their fathers and the damage we can do to ourselves when we use our fathers as the yardstick by which we judge ourselves. How can we ever be satisfied with who we are when we have a father who can 'wrestle a bear'?'The Kite Runner' is written with such startling realism that I can't help but think it is largely autobiographical. The settings of both Amir's childhood in Kabul and his adult life in the Bay Area are lovingly written with such clarity that I almost believe that I could go over the hill to Fremont and meet the very people described in the book."
3,"Good, but certainly not as good as EVERYONE else says.","I had to read this book for school, and while it's a pretty good read and well written, I was bored during almost the whole last third of the book. A good read, but check it out at the library, dont buy it."
2,"The first hundred pages really work, but then...","The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand."
2,Enjoyable book with amateur writing style,"I really enjoyed this book until I had time to reflect on what I'd read. As a whole I felt that the book, as written, was quite amateurish. The foreshadowing was obvious, the sequence of events too convenient as to be considered almost ridiculous, and towards the end the plot felt rushed. I get the impression that, if Hosseini is indeed a skilled writer, that the publisher wanted a more easily digested story that could be sandwiched into a few hundred pages for marketability."
5,Probably the best novel I've ever read!,"This novel, without a doubt, is the greatest novel I have ever read. I'm a twenty something year old male, who let the tears fly at the end of the book. The story telling Hosseini creates is astounding. Amazing forshadowing is seen throughout the book, often being revealed only till the end. The story itself does not have a ""cliche"" theme, it is entirely different from any novel I have ever read. Hosseini has created an amazing masterpiece worthy of every award imaginable. Read this before the film debutes, and I'd even suggest this as a possible holiday gift. I truly recommend this novel, it is a magnificent book that you can't put down and will want to share with everyone you know!"
5,Took my breath away,"The first 50 pages was a little slow in setting the scene but once this book hit it's stride it really hooked me. This book is incredible. I MUST read his other book ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"". It deserves more than 5 stars."
5,A stellar first book,"In this spellbinding debut, Khaled Hosseini tells a story of Afghanistan's modern history through the tale of Amir, who grew up in Kabul. His best friend was Hassan, the son of the family servant and a member of a shunned ethnic minority. As the son of a prominent businessman, Amir lived a good life, and yet he was always competing for his father's attention and approval, sometimes competing against Hassan. One eventful night in 1975, Amir makes a pivotal decision, a decision that not only marks his path for years but also destroys their family unit. Eventually fleeing to America with his father, Amir thinks he's run far enough away from his past, until someone from his past resurfaces. ""The Kite Runner"" is about fathers and sons, about the power of redemption, about the shining hope of literature. This is a book whose lush scope is wider than the confines of its pages."
1,this was awful,"This book was utterly wretched. It was written like a soap opera--the author decided to pull out 'all the stops'---any possible tragic event that could occur, did. I couldn't relate to a single character."
2,How can good be so bad,I cannot disagree that this book was written in a very compelling style but as well written as it was I painfully read the book dreading to think what horrible human foible awaited me on the next page. As I approached the middle of the book and I found myself avoiding it I sadly closed the book and began my quest for the next victim to read it. I have not for one minute regretted putting the book down unfinished and I cannot recommend it to anyone I know and love.
2,Too much abuse!,"Such a beautiful novel, interesting characters. Loved the tale of redemption and the kites in the sky. I felt very wounded by the story by the end. I couldn't stand to read about these children so abused. So haunting, I can't get those horrible images of abuse out of my head."
2,Emotionally beat-up by a book!,"I feel used. The book exposes the reader to all the sadness and tragedy of recent Afghan history. That's okay. However, at what emotionally cost. The book is still a fictionalized account. I was very upset to read one child being sodomized, but when a second child is brutally and repeatedly sodomized, I skipped forward to read the end, and put the book away. The book could have accomplished its purpose without that. It had great potential."
5,The Kite Runner,This story not only gave wonderful insights into another's life but also another culture. A credible story which was very touching and thought provoking.
5,Culturally rich,"This book was recommended to me by a coworker. I found it hard to feel bad for the spineless, spoiled little kid at the beginning of the book. As time goes along, though, you start to feel sympathy for his plight. I have been interested in Afghan culture and got a heavy dose of it in this book. Thank you, Khaled. This book is very similar to a book a friend of mine wrote called ""The Arbitrary Sword"" also available on Amazon.com. That book is about the Armenian people but it's also culturally enriching. I'm always fascinated by other cultures and if you are too, these books will entertain and inform you."
4,Only for the brave,"Had I read this book another time, I'm sure I would have rated it with 6 stars if I could. Unfortunately the day I opened the book, I wasn't ready to read the horrific events portrayed. Only that morning was I made aware of a frighteningly similar tragedy experienced by one of my closest friends, as the event which is pivotal in The Kite Runner.Because of the horror that was so real and devastating to me at the time, I'm not sure that I could appreciate the true literary impact and brilliance or the strength and growth of Amir, the central character.It is vividly and hauntingly written, and created an all too real picture of how lives can be destroyed when we find ourselves arrested in, and by, moments of fear."
3,Wonderfully written- but BRUTAL,"I'm always a fan of wonderful, thoughtful books, but I left this book feeling very violated. It is an eye-opening view of an Afghanistan I never knew about. However, if you have any kind of sensitivity to sexual atrocity, don't read it."
1,I cannot understand the good reviews,"This book is horrible in every possible way...except one...it is written TECHNICALLY very well. Other than that there is just a bunch of fluff to distract the reader from the obvious...it doesn't make sense! There are too many coincendences, too many things that happen to tug at the heart strings. Each moment is calculated to make the reader feel some emotion, which all books are, but this FEELS manipulative.I honestly think this is the worst kind of novel...designed for mass consumption....disposible writing. I think it is just a terrible indication of where the readership of the US is at this moment.This is a cheap dime store novel at best."
3,"Masterful Writing, Juvenile Plot","A wonderfully written book that is both sensual and moving, The Kite Runner sinks like a lead anchor due to the absolutely abysmal plotting. The ""big surprise"" which appears midpoint in the novel can be anticipated well in advance, and the ""coincidental"" appearance of a character later on tests the reader's limits of credulity, not to mention the sickeningly sweet, trite ending. I am amazed that a writer of such incredible talent has no clue as to how to avoid junior high school level plots. I can only hope that Mr. Hosseini can improve his weak spots and bring them up to the high level of his masterful prose."
2,"Contrived, disappointing & over rated with moments of interest","The geographic, political and cultural perspectives are shallow but shallow if you nothing about the last 25 years in Kabul; if you don't know where Kabul is you'll find this pretty exotic. Were it not for the 'middle east to LA immigrant setting' this book probably would not have been published except as a potential screenplay. The last third is a real page flipper (get it over with) as the author runs through the cliche checklist and ties together the loose ends (which are pretty predictable). I was disappointed that I read it."
1,Horrid,"I read this book for a book club. I gave it away to the first person who had an empty hand; I don't want anyone I like to have to read it.The style was annoying, like the author was trying to make it easy for a film adaptation to be made. The narrator was a jerk who was never likeable, even at the end. He never made right what he'd done wrong in the beginning. The details of a boy raping another boy, and all the references back to that were so haunting and unnecessary. And the details of how the pervert child raper's eye got knocked out was incredibly gorey, I almost puked. I kept reading because I was sure it was to get better by the end. It NEVER got better!How did this book get any good reviews? I'd give it twenty dead turkeys if I could!"
2,Two motherless boys............,"One of the reviewers blamed liberal guilt for this book's popularity. I'm a liberal and I think the book is a manipulative piece of......... Two boys, Afghanistan, class-conflict,... I also could not finish this snore-fest. Two stars rather than one on the slight possibility I am missing something here."
5,Deeply Moving First Novel,"Mr. Hosseini's first novel is a marvelous work that shows a side of Afghanistan most of us never knew of. This is a wonderful novel, with well developed characters and a riveting story that blends together into a remarkable whole. Highly recommended, and I am looking forward to Mr. Hosseini's next book."
5,Heart- wrenching and phenomenal,"This novel, which seems more like an autobiography, stayed with me long after the last page. It affected me as a reader more than any others of our book-club books for over a year....Enjoy!"
5,Must-read for all Americans,"This book is wonderful and gives an intimate perspective of what it was like to grow up in Afghanistan, helping readers to see the humanity in all of us."
3,"Good debut, but highly overrated","This is a great effort from a budding writer. But as far as being a ""book of the year"" candidate (or anything near that) this book does not deliver. I read it hoping to be as thrilled with it as the dozens of people who recommended it to me. Yet I found myself stuck on the fact that it just would not hold together in critical parts. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The relationship between the father and son is so wildly inconsistent as to be unbelievable and the development of key characters is incomplete. The use of a foreign setting and native Afghani phrases and customs does not cover up that this is a book with significant holes. The beginning and end are stellar. Yet the peaks and valleys throughout are so variant that it makes one wonder where all the hype came from. Mark my words, this book is likely to suffer the same fate as the author's native country: be held up on a pedestal until an Iraqi author steals the limelight. Just wait and see."
2,Cliched and implausible,"This book disappointed me beyond belief. It started out good -- maybe a little overblown in how ""angelic"" the protagonist's childhood friend is -- but that aside, it was OK. The parts set in the US were also OK. But when the story returns to Afghanistan, it ends up being more like an Afghan Rocky story -- so cliched and implausible that I threw the book down in disgust.If this book wasn't about Afghanistan, no one would ever have noticed it, much less published it."
4,"A Powerful, Heart-Wrenching Tale That You Cannot Miss!","Wow. At first, this book made me feel really stupid. I knew very little about the different religious sects within the middle east. Honestly, I knew very little about the war between the Russians and Afghans.I had to do a little research on the internet to understand some things. I have to say, I feel smarter for reading this book. It is a great work of historical (recent historical?) fiction. The story and relationship between Amir and Hassan is heart-wrenching, as is the relationship between Amir and his father. I usually see plot twists and where a book is heading from miles away, but I did not see this one coming. It is a sad and gut-wrenching story. It's hard to read parts of the story, but it is worth it.I plan on reading Hosseini's novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns. I hear it is just as good, if not better than The Kite Runner.~Jenn"
4,a wonderful read,"this book has all the elements that make up a great, long-lasting novel. i can't wait for Hosseini's next novel!!http://www.lehrerin.us/books.htmlfor more reviews"
5,beautiful and sad,"I lived with my family in Kabul from 1956-60 and in India from 1962-65 when I visited Kabul twice. In the 60s Afghanistan seemed to be moving forward to a hopeful future.The descriptions of Kabul when Amir was a boy were so nostalgic and the descripions when he returned vey painful. I could not put he book down, a gripping story told with love."
1,A good Bollywood script!,"What a shame, the story starts nice and strong and then it turns into a low budget Bollywood movie with many twists and turns that doesn't make any sense! I was able to go through the first 200 pages in less than two days and then I started losing interest and by the time I got to the part where he finds his brother's son with the same guy who raped the child's father, I knew I needed to stop!!! I gave it one star because of the strong start."
1,In the interests of balance...,"Much as I'd prefer not to give negative reviews, I too am baffled by the adulation of this tome. Obviously the story is timely, and makes us feel like we are getting to know other cultures. All good. So did James Clavell.But to call it anything other than a spur of the moment pot-boiler leaves me gob-smacked. The writing is puerile, the plotting haphazard and the characters so two-dimensional they disappeared each time I turned the page.Enjoy it for what it is, and good luck to the author, but please restrain the hyperbole."
2,Overrated,"The book is written with good suspense and enjoyable ethnic color, but the literary devices employed are far too obvious, he uses a sledgehammer instead of a rapier in choosing plot events. Most students of a good college writing course could produce material like this. But the masters acknowledge the ""rules"" of creating fiction and then break those rules in unexpected and pleasing ways.Mostly this was a slog of a read for me, I had a hard time suspending disbelief."
3,WAY overrated !,"Everyone must have been told, by the media, how wonderful this book was, and then just followed along singing its praises like a herd of sheep. By the end, I was rolling my eyes and wondering how many more tragedies and much more unhappiness could befall one person.The content of this book and its popularity also cause me to wonder just what kind of perverted people enjoy writing/reading about cruelly raping young boys and torturing people? These occurances could have happened in the book without talking about them OVER AND OVER, and describing them in graphic detail, apparently titillating the author who felt the need to write (and write and write) about this garbage for our ""entertainment"" and the sick reader who calls this book wonderful.Sorry, count me out on the ""hooray for Kite Runner"" party. Mediocre at best."
2,"Strong start, slow finish","The positives -The book is extremely well written and has magnificent flow. The first 150 pages are gripping and the book is difficult to put down.The negatives -Towards the middle of the book, the story starts to drudge. I also didn't like the fact that the ending becomes apparent in the middle of the book. There are a few twists (which are mostly hokey), but this book starts fast and crawls towards the finish line.After the first 150 pages, I thought I would recommend it to everyone, but after the last 200 pages, I would only say it is on-par with most things out there."
2,Not much here,"I'm still baffled at the great reviews of this book. I thought the characters were underdeveloped, the emotions trite and remedial, and the storyline implausible. The plot was somewhat compelling in places but I had a hard time getting over the heavyhanded foreshadowing and description of emotion. All in all...pass."
2,Not for everyone,"I feel like I could have learned a lot about the time, the place, the people without being whacked over the head with heavy-handed ploys to wring tears and horror out of me. Afghan deserves to have its story told but I hope someone will take another, more subtle run at it.I wish I had read some of the reviews here before I had agreed to read this book for my book club, so I will reiterate what someone else said--if you have a low tolerance for violence (child abuse, rape, stonings), give this book a miss."
1,Not much of a challenge,"My biggest complaint with the book is the child rape and sexual exploitation incidents which, I felt, added nothing to the story and was added because ????"
1,I wish I hadn't read this,"I had heard raves about this book and finally had the opportunity to read it. I wish I hadn't. Disturbing and tragic, the writing was good but the subject was absolutely awful. I guess that I will stick with ""feel-good"" books since this depressed me terribly. Life has enough bad moments, who needs to add to them a thousandfold???"
2,OVERRATED,"This is not a terrible book, but I can't recall ever feeling so LET DOWN. I think the critics greatly overrated this author and this book, and the disappointment I'm experiencing now is palpaple.When everyone is raving about an author and Oprah is basically annointing this author as Pope I was expecting brilliance. Instead I got a mediocre author who penned a vaguely interesting tale. I'd rate the quality of this book as comparable to a slightly above average community college thesis.Read this book then to see what really good writinglooks like check out Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle.Cat's Cradle"
1,Biased book,"Isn't it funny how this book never mentions the ""Tajiks"" of Afghanistan.. They are the second largest ethnic group after Pashtuns. Let me tell you why, because the author is a Tajik himself. The reason he wrote this book is to cause a fight between Pashtuns and Hazaras, or so the people in the west would think that only Pashtuns and Hazaras are crazy people of afghanistan. this was a money grab attempt, and he succeeded."
4,Great story!,I loved the book and it took me almost no time to finish it. I simply could not put it down. I was a bit disappointed at how it ended but a good read never the less.
5,Afganistan discovered,The Kite Runner is a excellent novel. It tells us about the people and customs of Afganistan. You can see what Kabul appeared as before and after the Taliban's rise to power. The main character is interesting in that he is not a hero but somewhat a coward. The interaction between father and son is very thought provoking. What man has not wanted to please his father and felt at times that he has failed.The novel keeps your interest throughout. Hard to put the book down.
5,The Kite Runner,This is the best book I read last year.I bought another one to share since it's a keeper. Unforgettable characters. A glimpse into Afghanistan before the Russian invasion. A beautiful story of friendship. It was an emotional trip.
5,Engaging story,This story engaged you from the first page. Gave me a better understanding on the people and culture of Afghanistan.
5,Actually lives up to the hype...,"Usually when a book recieves this much hype it falls far below expectations. This book is one of the few that actually lives up to the excitement. A beautiful story with characters phenomenally developed and even an ending that satisfies. A very rare thing among the sea of ""adequate"" modern literature. Do yourself a favor and read this book. You will not regret it."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Khaled Hosseini has taken real-life circumstances and blended them with a somewhat plausible story to bring us an unforgettable novel. I had difficulty putting this one down until the last page.Like soldiers going to war, there are few moments of memorable accomplishment for the book's characters. There is a light shed on the Muslim nation of Afghanistan and all the horror it has experienced in the last 30 years. The story's outcomes are touching and leave the reader with a wish that things will proceed positively without any assurances given. I applaud Khaled on his first novel, and I wish him success on this and future works."
4,The novel is constructed in circular form as ...,"(***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad)... a man from Afghanistan, now living in San Franciso in 2001, gets news from the old country that touches off all his shameful memories of growing up in Afghanistan in the 1970s, disappointing his ultra-tough father, and failing dramatically to be much of a friend to Hassan, a servant boy who thought of him as a best friend.Now he hears that Hassan's son is in trouble back in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and he realizes he has a chance to redeem himself. Full chapter-by-chapter synopsis available (with spoilers, of course) at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
4,"Amazingly Depressing, Beautifully Sad, and Heart-Wrenchingly Poignant","Hosseini is incredibly talented for bringing the real character of a book character out. The protagonist is not a normal prtagonist. He is expressive and shy, hateful and loving, and cowardly and courageous in a way that makes the reader want to hug him and comfort him or push him away and yell at him. He defines the phrases ""flawed human"" and ""redemption"". This book is a tear-jerker (don't read it to cheer up) but is incredibly well-written."
2,Me too:,"I'm afraid I am in agreement with a previous reviewer, a Ms. Medina. I too struggled to love this book but didn't. I finally just stopped reading about two thirds in. The story was there but I never arrived. I wonder, did the hero find redemption through the adoption of his betrayed friends son? I wonder, is my assumption correct? Well, I don't wonder enough I guess. I'll just assume it is, if not I don't care. Anybody wanna buy a book?"
5,Return Home,"With sparse, lyrical, vivid prose Khaled Hosseini takes the reader into a world the American mind will find difficult to comprehend, but will never forget.Amir and Hassan run the street of Kubul as children, friends and brothers until evil splits them apart. Time changes everything and a tiny ray of hope finds its way to Amir.THE KITE RUNNER is difficult to begin and difficult to put down until the final word.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Not sure I completely understand the rave reviews...,"I wanted to love this book, and maybe I am just too picky a reader to have thought this was as good a book as the reviews say. Like so many people, I enjoyed the beginning. Actually, I enjoyed most of the book until he had to leave Afghantistan. After that, I just could not identify with the character development of his father and his wife. I thought it was strange how the author touched on the fertility struggle and the procedures she had to endure, yet not much else about their married life. Although I suppose in the end, I realized why that was important. It was OK. Not a bad book, but definitely not the best I have ever read."
2,Are You Kidding???,"If this book is what this country thinks of as brilliant literature then I'd say our standards have sunk to a new low. There were times while reading the book when I had great hopes for Hosseini's writing. He does have a knack for describing places and creating an atmosphere. However, his dialogue, his plot and most of his characters are juvenile and derivative to say the least. His ""bad guy"" is one of the most ridiculous creations I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. No wonder Hollywood can't wait to make this novel into a movie, it reads like a bad script masquerading as ""art"". Believe me, If Hosseini didn't have the ""cred"" because he's from Afghanistan, this book would never, ever be the subject of so much fawning and hype. I was sorely, sorely disappointed because I came to it with high hopes. *Sigh*."
2,Predictable soap-opera,"I found this book to be a disappointment. I enjoyed the ""descriptive"" passages; they were well-written. That said, the plot--and its ""twists--were entirely predictable; the major characters almost stereotypes. Perhaps the basis for a ""Hallmark"" movie but not a piece of enduring literature, no matter its sentimental appeal."
2,"Part travelogue, part propoganda","Halfway through the Kite Runner, you realize that the book has metamorphasized from a memoir/paean to Afghanistan into bombastic political allegory. The book certainly fills a niche for those of us who are starving for knowledge about Afghani culture and daily life, and so I had the distinct sense that the book was rushed to market with clear marketing goals rather than given the time it needed to evolve into a solid work of literature.While Hosseini marvelously captures the culture and ""feel"" of pre-Taliban Afghanistan (whether he does so accurately I have no ability to judge), his characterization is too simplistic. Hassan, who in the allegory stands in for the Afghani people, is just saintly. The father is stern and proud. The villains evolve by becoming super-villains.After finishing this book, I realized I would have learned more by reading a true travelogue, without the necessity of wading through one-dimensional propoganda and clumsy political allegory."
1,.02c,"So much hype, unfortunately this novel was way over-rated. I couldn't take anymore of Hosseini's redundant sentence structure and stopped 2/3 of the way through...""The rifle roars with a deafing crack. I follow the barrel on its upward arch. I see the face behind the plume of smoke. I am the man in the herringbone vest. I woke up with a scream trapped in my throat.""This novel goes on and on with the 7 to 8 word sentences. Boring descriptions, predictable story, tired out characters.I closed the book. I returned it to the library. I wonder why society enjoys reading at a fifth grade level."
1,This book is not good!,"Everyone loves this book, but I don't get it. The story is interesting, but I think a truly successful novel has a good story AND tells that story artfully. This book fails to do the latter. The second half is rushed and you can see the work the author put into the novel. By this I mean that you can actually tell when the author's editor told him to make changes."
2,Disappointing and Whiny,"I hear people love the kite runner. The audio version was not so great. I was excited that the author himself was going to read it but the protagonist sounded so very pathetic, due to (i think) the particular phrasings and accents by the reader, that I couldn't end the book -- one must find the protagonist at least understandable but I had such contempt for him that I had no interest in continuing the audio version. I spoke to others who read the book and they didn't find the protagonist whiny or pathetic, which leads me to believe it was in the reading...who knows."
2,A tale of enduring cowardice and betrayal.,"I am compelled to write this, my first Amazon review, as a warning. As clear an image as Mr.Hosseini relates, I don't want his characters, especially his central character, Amir, in my mind.Amir, though gifted in many ways, is a bone-deep coward who never outgrows his shame through repeated, lifelong betrayals of the people that love him. Even his final hope, a potential for an expected redemption, is both late and half-hearted, disappointing any misguided empathy.The story gives a sad, vivid glimpse into Afghanistan under the Taliban, and Mr.Hosseini has developed the story, and it's characters, very clearly. I just don't want my kids to imagine them. Ultimately, there is nothing redeeming here."
3,Dollops of Melodrama,"The Kite Runner is not a bad book, but it is also not a great book - it is, in my humble opinion, a fairly average debut. The major flaw in this novel I think is that it comes across as a formula book. What's the formula? This is what I believe it is -i) Take an autobiographical account as the outer framework (the author's childhood in Kabul/Afghanistan and move to the US in the 1980s)ii) Add a protagonist (the kite runner and the narrator)iii) Add a villain (Assef)The themes are a little too elemental and the plot a little too convenient. My recommendation for this book is very half hearted."
2,don't know what all the excitement is about,"It basically comes down to being a somewhat interesting and sad story with a happy ending. That's about it. Really....I thought I was going to learn a bit more about Afgan culture, the Russian occupation and the Taliban. I guess I should have read more of a history book instead. I hope you find it more entertaining than I did. Not a real page-turner in my eyes, but maybe it will help you fall asleep at night."
5,Best book I've read in a long time!,Hands down one of the best books I've read. It's heartwarming and heart breaking all at the same time. Hossenis writing is flawless and the story sucks you in from the get go. You wont be able to put this down.
2,overrated as literature,"The plumbing is okay as are the rivetting plotted stylings of pulp fiction and as the book is meaningful at least in real world terms. However, it is a strange apple. It's adolescent fiction parading around, dressed up as literature. In this case, for me at least, the prose in its complete simplicity and in too many cases, flatness, hinders the message and the drama, that lies within."
1,Horribly written version of what could have been a good story,"This novel seems to be a filled-in outline. The plot is an absolute straight line from here to there. What are supposed to pass as plot twists are as subtle as a cesspool on a hot summer afternoon. The only reason I finished it was to see if the happenings I had foreseen actually occured (they did, without exception).One word? Drivel."
1,Just awful!,"This book was just awful. Boring, and without an interesting plot, the whole book can be summed up in four words: ""Afghanistan really, REALLY sucks!"""
4,Kite Runner,I found this story to be spell binding. It gives wonderful insight to how people in middle east live and their struggles to survive. I had a hard time putting it down.
4,Great and Sad,"Great, moving, sad and well narrated novel. Not easy to enjoy as events described are devastating. A story of ruined childhood and adult self regret, in a decaying, savage country, cruel and out of control violence upon miserable, good hearted people. A spark of hope lingers, a bit too weak and bitter to be called a happy ending. Not much energy left to move right now on A Thousand Splendid Suns."
3,Old movie with a new screenplay,"There is not enough twist in the story, at least for me. The book gives a good insight into Afghan culture. The bonding between the characters has been portrayed good. I would only suggest this book for getting to know Afghan culture."
3,Good read,"Good read through first half, turns melodramatic and unbelievable in second. Drags a bit too. But a good read."
5,Excellent book!!!,"First, this authur has a tremendous way of writing and keeping the reader enthralled. This book is excellent and you will not want to put it down after starting to read. You get caught up in the characters and their emotions and thoughts and feelings. I have highly recommended this book to my friends and family. Also his other book 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'.Enjoy!"
5,A New Great author on the Horizon,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this book. I was more than pleasantly surprised. I could not put the book down. Hosseini has a very comfortable style of writing. This is the best book that I have read in a long time. Have just started ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"". It is another page turner. I am looking forward to many more books from this author. I can't praise him enough."
4,Riveting,"Very good book. Clean prose, straightforward style. Timeless story. It's not very often that I read a book that I can't put down...The Kite Runner was a very noteable exception."
3,I liked the first half,"The first half of the book was intense, heartbreaking, and moving. It takes place in Afghanistan Kite Runner tells the story of a friendship, class divides, and life before and after the Taliban. I think one of the hardest things for me to read was the cruelty in the book--to the point where I disliked the narrator greatly. The second half read more like a soap opera, was too dramatic and predictable."
2,Was all right.,"At least it was an interesting read. I had trouble caring for the main character - he seemed like sort of a jerk. I mean, his best friend as a kid, and he wouldn't stand up for him etc? Wasn't believable not to mention terribly depressing. Even the ""Happy ending"" isn't happy at all. Everyone seems miserable. It reads well and it won't take you long to finish, but I had trouble connecting with the people in the story."
5,This will become one of your favorites,"I must admit that when I saw this on the shelf at the bookstore, I wasn't blown away at the prospect of reading it. However, a few people had recommended it to me, so I purchased it anyway and started reading it as soon as I got home. I soon realized that everyone was right -- this book really is amazing. It is very well written, and it has an interesting style that left me crying at some parts and laughing at others.This is a story of friendship, courage, struggle, betrayel, heartbreak, and love which in the end, leaves you wanting to live your life in a better way and nurture your friendships because it makes you realize that you never know what life will throw at you.It's hard to write about it without giving away any spoilers, so my suggestion would be to go buy it now! You won't regret it."
3,Good but not great,"A very uneven book. The first part, in Afghanistan, is fantastic -- lots of strong images and sensual details that really bring the city of Kabul alive. It's still good when the scene shifts to California, as we see the reversal of the relationship between the main character and his father. But the final third is far too predictable and rather cheesy. I could see the major twists coming long ahead of time. And certain aspects of this part are totally unbelievable. Given the strong beginning to the book, this is a real shame.A promising debut. But the author's not quite there yet. I have high hopes for his next book, which apparently is about Afghan women."
4,Kite Runner takes you to another place,"Kite Runner really makes me appreciate growing up in America. Sometimes we don't realize how good we have it. We don't always see how much harder it is in other countries. No matter what culture you are from there are some things that don't need to be translated: Unconditional love, friendship, honor, respect are all covered in this novel. It also covers abuse, neglect, shame, guilt, and fear. This was a book that takes you to a different place (Afghanistan), a place that most of us would not be familiar with. Even though it's a different culture, I felt like I was right there with them. It was sad when there was loss, happy when there was joy, etc. You get to feel a lot of emotions when you read this one. This novel was certainly well done. There is a reason the reviews are so good. Read it!"
2,"Engaging, but juvenile","While the story is certainly engaging, the plot development is predictable, the characters almost too perfect, and the writing a bit juvenile. I knew what was going to happen before I even turned the page, and not because of good foreshadowing.How many times do we have to read about Amir coming to terms with the horrible act that caused he and Hassan to become separated? After Amir's horrible pummelling, are we really expected to believe he makes a full recovery, so quickly? And how neat and tidy is it that we learn who the Taliban pummeller is? And that he ends up with a harelip, just like Hassan?I'm glad I read that book, but I can't understand why everyone raves about it. I wish there were more passages detailing the travesties of the Taliban, instead of yet another passage of Amir realizing how he did Hassan wrong.It becomes repetitive, culminating in a story that ends with a pretty bow on it."
3,"Decent prose, cliched everything.","I didn't love this book and I didn't hate it. I can understand some of the antipathy of the 1-star reviewers, but I wouldn't have made it through the book as quickly as I did if I felt the way some of them claim to. Overall, it has the simple flow of Water for Elephants (which I liked) but combined with the easy-to-spot narrative devices of a high school English class. So I guess it makes sense that the only reason I read it is because several of the kids I tutor are reading it for their English classes. I hated feeling like the author was saying, 'Aha! Here's where I will use foreboding! And THIS is the place for some irony!"" It really feels that forced. And I do agree with the analysis that the narrator is a grade-A, self-involved b*****d, and I didn't feel like his version of redemption was all that convincing.Overall: You can probably do better with your free time."
2,Not too good,"Although The Kite Runner is a good read it is not and never will be a classic. It is a very predictable book which leaves a few loose ends. It is like a predictable movie which you still keep watching to make sure you were right about the ending. There are no strong female characters in the movie which just strengthens the stereotype of Afghan society and the female role in it. The cowardice of the main character is far too frustrating. The number of coincidences in the book make the story too unreal. The good thing of the book is the depiction of an Afghan refugee in America. It seems to be quite real. Afghanistan from an outsiders point of view seems to be more written from watching the country on CNN/BBC rather than a first hand account.Overall, you can read it but if you don't expect too much, you will enjoy it more."
1,Since when is humiliation entertaining?!,"If your idea of entertainment is reading about a child being sodomized while his ""best friend"" watches, too scared to intervene, then this is a perfect book for you. I bought it based on the positive reviews, but I have to say that a story does not need such vulgarity and brutality to be powerful and effective. Don't we read to escape from the harshness of reality?!"
1,Self-serving junk,"This book is horrible. The plot is so obvious it's embarrassing, the protagonist is a despicable coward yet the author clearly wants us to like and forgive him. Was it Shaw who said that a slingshot in the waistband of a 10 year old in act four must be fired by act five? It's not even particularly well written, and it is junk."
2,Same old same old...,"There is no doubt in my mind that this book will be on book club lists. It's not badly written, and it will keep you fairly interested. However, there is nothing new in this book. It's just another one of those novels about how someone's life in another country is just horrible. You know, one of those ""pc"" profound things we're supposed to read to keep us ""culturally aware."" Seems that all you have to do to get published these days is put one of these novels out. I found myself rolling my eyes on many occasions. If it takes you a long time to read a book, don't invest that time in this one. If it takes you just a matter of 2-3 hours (and you have them to waste), by all means, dip into yet another of this stew of pretentious publishing malarky."
5,Moving,"One of the best books I read in a while. Great expression of feelings, of love, of friendship and the conscience. The book gives a great insight of Afghanistan too. Highly recommended."
3,The Kite Runner CD,"I had to read this book for a College English class. This cd helped me keep up in class. I found this book to be very well written, however, if you are a person who is sensitive to sexual abuse I do not recommend reading this book. It is very detailed of how the abuse happens, I found that it would sneak up on you, making it hard to be able to skip over the disturbing part. With this said, I think that this is a very inspiring book, helps you understand the true meaning of forgiveness and repenting of your sins. It also helps to put out there that sexual abuse happens in this ugly world more than you know."
2,best seller?,"Okay, spoiler here. go away if you don't want to know what happens.I liked most of the book, I didn't know much about Afghanistan, so it helped me know something . BUT, as an adoptive parent of a child from central Asia, I nearly had a breakdown when he had to tell the boy he must go back to the orphanage. I had to stop reading and find a summary online about what happened next. okay, the boy attempts suicide, I nearly threw up on my computer.I could write the sequel to this. Poorly adjusted, sexually abused child, getting no psychological help from anyone, either DOES kill himself quickly, or slowly through drugs and alcohol. He would probably be put on many different mind-altering drugs until zombied out. He is committed to a psych hospital.I am not entertained by this plot device. Don't really see why it is a best seller. I won't read any more of his books."
5,Great book,"I had a hard time putting this down (and sometimes a hard time picking it back up, due to the subject matter). I tend to read fun books, but this was a great book to get me outside of my reading comfort zone. Really well written. I read it well before the movie came out and felt the movie didn't even come close to invoking the emotions in me that the book did. It provided great insight into Afghanistan culture."
3,Kite Runner - you get what you pay for,The book had handwritten notes in it. One tipped me off on a character. But I love the story.
2,Not very good,"This book does not compare to the other. It is the same type, but not as engaging. Didn't even finish it."
5,Daughter said I would like it,"I really was surprised at how much I liked this book. From what I had heard about it on the news a few years back, I thought it was not for me largely because I am not particularly interested in Afganistan culture. But to my surprise I found it riviting.\I think the thing that makes the book is that the hero or central character is anti-heroic. He is the poster boy for those of us who because of fear failed to do what they knew was right, only to be dogged by their consciences years later. For people like myself who have always acted bravely and fearlessly this is of course hard to understand, But for the rest of humanity, they probably will find that they tend to identify at least to some degree.So anyone who wants a good book that unflaggingly holds the reader's interest from page to page while providing an interesting story and view of another culture as a sidelight should enjoy it. Like my daughter said ""buy it. you'll like it""."
2,Disappointing,"Although this book was somewhat entertaining, I ultimately found it dissapointing. The characters are largely one-dimensional, even formulaic (the all-good devoted childhood friend, the sadistic bully, the conflicted protagonist who hits you over the head with his internal conflict ... over and over, the weakly drawn female afterthought). To make things worse, the plot twist in the second half of the book defy credulity, even for fiction."
2,Overrated,"I read this book without any expectations, but I was more and more disappointed as I continued.The writing style is smooth. It does a good job of portraying life in Afghanistan and the difficulties faced by the pople there.But the plot is so cliche and predictable that I had a hard time getting to the end. The characters seem very one-dimensional. Hassan is the epitome of loyalty. Assef is so ""evil"" he should have a twirled moustche, etc. The number of coincidences had me rolling my eyes, and kept me from feeling any sort of suspense about what would happen next. And the ending wrapped up exactly as you would expect, once you find out the major plot point which happens halfway through the book.I wanted to like the book, but I'm just distracted by its shortcomings."
5,Incredible Story,"My knowledge of Afgani culture is limited, but this book offered an amazing look into some of it (whatever part of it is accurate). It's sad and painful to hear how someone can grow up with another person, consider them a 'friend' and then completely betray them time and time again. And to top it off - the one betrayed remains loyal throughout life! (I'm obviously being very vagued but it would be wrong to spoil the story).If there is anything that I can nitpick about the book, it would have to be some of the elementary foreshadowing style used (i.e. 'John came home; little did we know it would be the last time'). Aside from that, everything is wonderful. These characters are well thought out and it's very easy to develop a strong emotional bond with them (even if it's negative).I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to invest in a deep story and can stomach watching the developments of the Iraq War on the news."
2,A Tear Jerker is a Tear Jerker,"Even with the tears streaming down my face, I knew this wasn't the real thing. I felt the author pulling the strings and soon could see each plot twist coming because it was needed to make his point. It's a shame because he can write well when he isn't trying to manipulate his characters and his readers. This is a perfectly balanced book - for every bad act, there's a redeeming act. If you like tidy, comforting books, this may be for you. Don't let the setting and politics mislead you, it's just a tear jerker."
2,Revolting tale of humanity,"For the first half of the book I was really enjoying it. Then towards the end the main character makes a pathetic deal with (what until then had been an imaginary) god to heal the boy. Then, most disturbingly, they bring a SAVAGELY sexually abused child to the U.S. and DO NOTHING TO HELP HIM!!! Did they think that the trauma would just...go away...? ""Look how he smiled at the kite!"" That is how psychopaths are created! What a revolting tale of humanity. The author is either clueless, lazy or steeped in cultural poisonous dysfunction. I won't bother with his other works."
5,Wundebar,This is a book that I didn't want to end. I wanted to keep reading about these compelling characters and learn about the next chapter in their lives. Highly recommended.
4,Very compelling first novel,"I try to read the latest acclaimed fiction releases, and often they don't live up to the raves. This was one of the standouts that I read in 2005. The story of Amir and Hassan was entertaining and compelling and was a fast-paced read. It was an emotional story of redemption that was ultimately fulfilling in the end. I was also glad that, while it had a happy ending, it was still an imperfect and bittersweet one.I gave this only four stars because it was predictable. But it's possible that it was predictable because the acknowledgements in the _front_ of the book gave me a very obvious clue about the way the story would turn out. I think fixing this in future editions would be a good idea."
4,An Unforgettable Story,"This novel is about a young boy, Amir, who has a wonderful friend, Hassan, who sticks up for him through thick and thin, but when it comes time for Amir to stick up for Hassan, he turns into a coward. This small act of fear tears the two friends apart and them never seeing each other again. This book shows the life of a boy who grows up and tries to correct his wrongful ways of the past by trying to make up for them in his future. This novel was an exciting and riveting book that really keeps your attention. I really enjoyed reading about the different events that took place in Amir's life and how every little thing that happened affected more than just one person's life. The book starts off kind of slow in the beginning but once you keep reading it, it's a very fast paced book and it's just one that you won't want to put down."
4,A great start!,"I finished reading the Kite Runner and I'm already rushing out for the author's next book, ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"". I enjoyed the author's incredible writing prose that left me with vivid images to allow my imagination to run away with. Unfortunately, this book is not for the weak at heart and often leaves you in a valley of sadness, without another peak of happiness for the characters around the bend. I feel that the writer wrote the book this way to show the readers that day to day life in Afghanistan is beyond a struggle and most often does allow a for a happy ending. Overall I enjoyed this book immensely and feel that my eyes have opened to the plight of Afghanis and hope that life will improve dramatically one day, even if not in the near future."
4,The Kite Runner,I enjoyed this book. As I read it I kept thinking it was an actual account of the author's earlier life in Afganistan. As it turns out it was fiction so I felt a bit mislead. Other than that it was a very interesting story and I believe it was meant to be true to life in a general way.
3,Could be better,"Just finished the book after many recommendations. First half of the book - liked it; there are thoughts, even though not very new; characters, even though not all likable, story, even though not that original - but all together is not a bad read, poignant and believable. Second half - soap opera, and not a good one. Nothing is plausible - the homeless who new Amir's mother, Assef - were Hassan and his son major things in his life? How did he find the boy? The fight between Assef and Amir, the slingshot, the ending - everything... became boring and predictable, just perfect for Hollywood - no more thoughts, characters and story."
5,Amazing,"Read this book. There are some parts that take your breath away, but it's worth it. I love this new author!"
4,Great read,"I have heard so many amazing reviews about this novel I had to pick it up to see what the fuss was about. This is a powerful and moving story that left me crying at points so it is evident the author has you caring about the characters. The brutal horrors that occurred in our narrator's life helped shape the man he became, and the novel takes you on his self discovery to see if he can relive his past and grow stronger or run from it again. Although this book is frustrating at times-you very much can grow to dislike our main character because of his choices-it makes the reader think how they would respond in similar situations or in a different time. This book was so moving I couldn't help but tell my family about what was occurring as I read more and more each day. This would be a great book to pick up, but definitely not a summer beach read. This book is one I will not soon forget."
3,Not for the sensitive,"I got about 65 pages into this book and had to stop. It was too harrowing for me to read about the bad stuff happening to 12 year old Hassan. It's not enjoyable. I enjoy complex stories but this was just too much for me to handle. If you don't like to read about bad stuff happening to young kids, do not read this book."
5,Simply put: This is a great book,"This is an amazing story. It is so engaging and interesting; there are so many twists and turns that are not predictable at all. It also gives a perspective of Afghanistan that I had never known before. The father character is so heart breaking, especially in the second half - you feel like these characters could be in your own family. Everyone that reads this story loved it. You laugh, you cry (mainly cry) - it's something totally unique from the bland fiction out there. READ IT."
4,"Slow start, then couldn't put it down!","The book started a bit slow, and the ending had an extra twist that put it a little over the top. Kite Runner kept me up late and it was well worth the lost sleep. The plot was interesting, the main characters had real depth, and Amir's internal struggle was gripping."
3,interesting!?,"we read this for a ""book club"" and although many people found it disturbing in parts it was hardly great literature . Easy to read and thought provoking maybe But all the ends tied in nicely was it written with a film in mind. any one who read this and thought they were getting some insider view on Afgahnistan had better go on to read ""Caravan "", although written many years ago i thought this gave a better flavour to the area and even more names conjured up from this geographical region. For those who hear the towns mentioned on the news this also has maps and a whole lot more on the people of the area.and is equally harrowing. Why were women missing from this book???"
3,Like the way,"... it makes the Glominerals pressed base look, but I think it's adding to my already greasy skin. If I don't wear sunscreen underneath my makeup, it's fine. If I do, which I'm diligent about during the day, my face is sliding off within a couple of hours. Use sparingly."
5,Love glominerals!,Consistently offer great products! Great for those chronic dry skin sufferers! The spritz effect is conveinent and easy to keep in your purse!
5,Glo-tastic,Gives your skin a healthy looking GLO with each mist. I won't leave home without my GLOmineral mist I get so many compliments on my skin since I started using this product about a month ago....try it! I have slightly oily skin and I get a natural glo not the oily look ;)
5,the perfect kinfe,"This knife is the perfect blend of multi-functionality and size. It'll do a lot and still fit in my pocket. Other knives do more but you need a belt holster to carry them. Slimmer knives leave me wishing for this or that at times (like a Phillips head screwdriver or a pair of tweezers). This one is perfect for me. I should have bought a dozen of them to guard against losing one from time to time for the rest of my life, just in case they quit making them."
3,"Charmed & Dangerour (Bronwyn the Witch, Book 1)","I really liked this book and have started on the other books in the series. However, the only negative comment I have is that it is too short. I know it is in a diary form and that it is suppose to be short and sweet as you would write a diary but I would love for the author to bring out a novel with more details of her world. The characters are lovable and more than two dimenional which makes for a great read."
2,Harmless,"Meh. It was fine for what it's worth. I wasn't all that impressed with the story and I'm not overly fond of the diary format, though I'll admire it when it's done well. This... wasn't done well.Predictible story, you pretty much know what is going to happen from the beginning. Still, it had it's good moments."
2,"A little weak, but good.","I got this book used. The author writes with wit and charm. The plot...well, it was a bit weak. Why would a witch in Texas be working for the British government, would not the USA government have made more sense? And why is a 272 page paperback $14.00? Even with a discount at Amazon it is over 11 bucks, hat is why I brought it used, and I am so glad. It is a nice light read, with charm and wit. Even with the minor plot flaw I enjoyed it and would have rated it higher but it just is not worth the price. Has anyone else noticed the number 10 and higher paperbacks on Amazon lately, what is the deal?"
5,Charmed and Dangerous and ohhh so good,I LOVED this book. From page one you are grabbed and pulled along. You just can't seem to put the book down. I started it and finished it in 8 hours. My hisband was so tired of watching me read but I just had to know what was going to happen. I hope that she writes more.
5,Prepare to have some serious fun,"This debut by Candace Havens is a sparkling entry into the world of paranormal chicklit. It's hilarious, touching, seriously fun and magical. It's the empowering story of a one woman secret service tasked with protecting the Prime Minister of England. On the job, the protagonist, Bronwyn, encounters love, danger, violence, cool clothes, and laugh out loud situations. Read it. You'll have a ball."
2,I wanted to like this book,"The concept was great, but the book read like a Cliff's Notes. The author didn't pull me in at all...I felt like it was a sketch of a book and not fully fleshed out. As a result, I only had a passing interest in the characters even though the spirit was fun."
1,Get from the library,"I saw this on a library shelf. It sounded interesting. After three nights of trying to get into it, I gave up! I understand the diary format but it was a bit confusing. Times didn't match up. People come out of the woodwork after the fact to explain things. I feel bad for the person who paid $14 for the book! Always check with your local library first. Doesn't cost anything and you can always put a hold on books and have them delivered to your nearest branch."
3,Very light read,"There really isn't a lot to recommend this book. It is a cute (if far fetched), quick read that might have turned out OK if every single, romance book cliché ever created wasn't employed at the end.Bronwyn, a high level witch living in Texas, works for the British PM and employees her magic to protect him and by proxy, the free world. On a business trip, she finds herself protecting a very cute Sheik as well as the PM (big bodyguard no-no in the real world). Well, someone wants Sheikie dead in a serious manner. After saving the Sheik and PM, she returns to Texas where she meets a cute warlock (which means traitor and is not a suitable title for a male witch-type person) The Sheik is impressed by her skills and hires her to protect him from assassination. Bronwyn is off to the Middle East before she knows it and sets off to discover the truth behind the plot.The book is written in a diary like style, which is a turn-off for some."
2,Not recommended...,"Hate to write a bad review on a book, but I have to say this book is pretty horrible. I purchased it hoping for a nice paranormal romance kind of novel with a decent plot. This book has neither of these. I found the plot slow and boring when the protagonist wasn't male-bashing. And I am usually someone who can read anything. It wouldn't have been so bad, except I paid $14.00 for this paperback. I'd recommend passing on this book."
1,Truly awful,One of the worst books I've ever tried to read. The lead character has the impulse control of the typical two-year-old.
2,charmed and boring,I found the format interesting; but the actual book itself a bit boring. I had a hard time staying interested in the book and the characters.
4,Marriage counselor finds love with an unlikely suspect.,This is not the best book that Rita Herron has written but I found that when I picked it up it turned out to be a page turner. I had to suspend reality just a tad but in general the book was enjoyable and I would recommend it.
1,I'm done,"Rita Herron books keep popping up free for Kindle, so I keep giving her another chance. But her characters are consistently annoying (what is up with the way the 5-year-old talks in this? She's old enough to be semi-coherent, and when she says stuff like ""He broked it"" her father should correct her!) and the situations are just ridiculous. There are several instances of thinly veiled racism (or at the very least, stereotypes) in this as well, which I found pretty offensive. Sorry, Ms. Herron, you've had more chances than most authors get. ""Free"" isn't cheap enough for your stuff."
1,What a horrible waste...,"This is by far one of the worst books I read. Shallow characters, stupid set-ups, words repeated over and over and over, until you are seriously nauseous. Please do not put yourself through this torture..."
1,Please hide me under the covers...,"What a silly premise for a book: a local therapist, who is blind to the shallowness of her own marriage, pens a ""relationship"" book, which is bought fanatically by just about everyone in Georgia; a journalist, who needs a story to redeem his credibility and avenge the break-up his marriage by destroying the therapist's reputation, poses as her husband to get all the juicy details.I'd tell you more, but I need to puke...If you like really silly characters and dumb plots, this book is for you."
3,"Diverse Characters, Sweet Story",Under the Covers is a sweet romance with an interesting plot and a great cast of diverse characters. A lot of themes were explored during the story. The pace of the novel was really slow at times but the concept interesting enough and the story enjoyable enough to keep reading. First time reading Rita Herron and I'll definitely read other books by this author.
3,Under the Covers...Just OK,"I rate Under the overs only three states because it took a while to really pull me in. I continued to read on waiting for the book to grab me, and that finally happened about half-way thru the book. I enjoyed the last half much more than the first half. I think it could've been less build up and more to the story and I would've loved an epilogue to get a view of what is going on in Hunter & Abby's life a few months/years done the road."
5,AWESOME,"It kept me turning pages as fast as my fingers could handle. Loved every minute!!!! A real rollercoaster ride, nonstop!!!"
4,One of the best in the series !!,"Still Life with Crows is definitely one of the best in the Pendergast series.It is more exciting,the flow is smoother and it showed a human side of Pendergast,him showing emotions and care for Corrie.The ""criminal"" in this book is someone that at the end,you won't have heart to blame,as his situation do not allow him any space or opportunity to be otherwise.Read it if you are a fan of Pendergast.You won't regret it !"
5,Hard to put down!!,"So far I've read Relic, Reliquary and now this book. These authors are great! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough in this novel. It's a horror slash mystery novel that you will blow through in a couple of days. The last hundered pages or so actually got my heart racing as I was frantically flipping through to find out what would happen in the end. Check it out, I know I'm going to continue to read more from these guys."
4,Once again.....good read,"Another installemnt in the most excellent Pendergast series. This time the creepy one is in the heartland of America investigating a series of murders. The characters are VERY well written and the story is well plotted. You are unsure as to who the bad guy is until after the halfway point. Some people might gripe about the identity of the murderer but if you do then you have not read the other works of these author(s). I thought it was a rather ghoulish twist and highlighted the whole ""creepy little town"" vibe. I just picked up the next Pendergast novel..I'm quite sure it will be just as good as this one. Bravo!"
4,Good read for late night with a book light and storm,"Yes, the mind crossing is a bit far fetched. How would he know he got it right? Yes, the climactic scene is a bit long and formulaic.It is not the best from Child and Douglas.It is not ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".But any book that keeps me up till sunrise to finish ranks 4 stars in my book. And reading it over night, with only a booklight, and a heavy storm in the background, does add to the enjoyment."
2,"I agree with a lot of people on here, the first 2/3s of the book was really good...","...it was funny, engaging and mysterious with good character development, etc. Possible spoiler: The problem begins with who the killer is. It's just so stupid and unbelievable who the authors made the killer to be. Not only that but I don't know if a fifty year old malnourished human being who never had enough vitamin D for proper development could be strong enough to rip another human being's arm off. The whole Pendergast going-into-a-trance to solve the crime is such a cheat to readers."
3,"I don't think we're in... oh wait, we are","Pendergast, unfortunately, got on my nerves a bit in this book. At least this time the plot takes him out of his usual element and makes him slightly more bearable. The storyline is pretty good (if stretching the imagination a bit, especially with the meditation scenes - you either have to believe in that or suspend your disbelief for that part of the novel to be palatable) and moves along at a brisk pace. Also, the addition of a new ""sidekick"" really livens up the book. I found myself rooting for her much more than Pendergast. Also, there were some characters in the book that I initially misjudged - and I do like being surprised by characters! Unfortunately, I found the ending to be a little melodramatic and predictable, but it was still worth the read."
2,"IT,S GOING DOWNHILL FOR THESE WRITERS","I realy wanted to like this book and for some reason it kept my interest...until pendergast retreated in this so called meditation....I began flipping through the pages because I wanted to know who the killer was....well...now I know and I have to say ""quelle surprise ""What do you mean "" the killer has the face of a child "" What is wrong with the person who eddited this book. Didn't he read the whole book before the identity of the killer was revealed. If he did he would know that there is no way in hell this killer could be precieved as being a beautiful child like face.I'm sorry but in my opinion these guys had a one-struck-hit with the 'RELIC'and aren't able to pull something like that of again."
4,Strong until the end,"Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are masters at the details of narrative and character needed for thrillers. They also are quite strong in their ideas, but occassionally they come up with something that has a lot of potential that they don't quite come through on. Still Life with Crows is a case in point. I don't want to put in any spoilers, but suffice it to say that the ending lacks the punch and closure that I was eagerly expecting based on the excellent lead-up to it. I still think Relic is their best all-around story to date, but I think they are capable of another classic blockbuster."
5,a fast paced thriller that you can't put down...,"lincoln child and douglas preston have outdone themselves with this book. the last novel i read like this was salems lot by stephen king. once you start, its hard to put it down. i can't wait to read their next book. i just hope it is as good as this one was."
5,Preston and Child come through again!,"From the very first page you can feel the August heat coming off the endless rows of corn to sear your lungs and turn your brain against itself. Small town Kansas ain't what it used to be when there's a killer amongst the faces you've known all your life. Into this furnace comes Special Agent Pendergast, dressed to the nines in his hand tailored shirt and suit with the custom made shoes that dirt wouldn't dare cling to. If this is your first foray into the worlds of Preston and Child you will enjoy it but I would recommend that you read their books in order of publication. Otherwise, it would be like eating dessert without a meal first. Still yummy but so much better when it comes at the end of an excellent repast."
2,Still Born With Crows,"They had me. They really had me. Killer on the loose. Pendergast on the investigation. Killings with strange, inexplicable clues. Then...we reach the end of the book and...BAM...Preston/Child have now officially succumbed to Crichton Syndrome (meaning it's impossible to end a book on a high note) Without revealing the ending for those of you who will want to read it, let me just say that it's the most ridiculous, ludicrous ending that I've read in a long while. I expect so much more from these guys and they have let me down in their last 2 books. C'mon guys. I dare you to top ""Relic."" I dare you to surpass ""Riptide."" I dare you.Please."
2,A relaxed effort not a winner,"I guess the authors took a break on this one--it is certainly not up to their best. The plot is given away way too soon and is rather boring. They really have to stretch to tie up the loose ends by the last few pages, and one wonders if earlier they intended to write something else but got tired and just decided to use unconvincing explanations for why certain objects were used in the killings. This gets 2 stars just for the appearance of Special Agent Pendergast--though he too is on vacation in this one. Perhaps the writers should spend longer than a year coming up with new ideas. Given the authors' hot and cold reputation, one may want to wait for reviews before purchasing their next book."
3,Mildly entertaining thriller,"This book is far short of the entertaining read that ""Relic"" provided. Although it has its moments of suspense and horror, the resolution proved somewhat disappointing. The thing that I found absolutely the most interesting part of the book with a truly horrifying and chilling ""wow"" factor was the very, very end when the killer's behavior is explained. How frustrating to have to read the entire book before I hit a point where I was stunned. When I read a book, especially by the Preston/Child team, I expect to be stunned repeatedly throughout. Nonetheless, ""Still Life With Crows"" provides a diverting - if not exceptional - read. You'll be entertained but not bowled over."
3,"Fun read, disappointing ending","I've enjoyed reading Preston-Child books for a while now. I'm also finding the Pendergast character quite intriguing. The pace was good. Enough suspense. Preston-Child are known for stretching believability for entertainment's sake but this one really went over the line. I can't say much more without giving away too much information. Looking forward to reading more from them though ---- Cabinet, and Brimstone."
2,Very dissapointed,"Seldom am I dissapointed in a recommended book, however, this bookwas really weird. The author makes the characters not believable,they are weird characters and you don't feel it's because of the story line.The story itself at the end is not believable either."
3,Pendergast on vacation,"This is another entry on the Special Agent Pendergast series. It follows after ""The Cabinet of Curiosities"" and sets the stage for the next one ""Brimstone"". It is not needed to read the books in order, all of them wrap up the main plots nicely, leaving somehow residual subplots to continue in other novels.Pendergast takes an assignment while he is on vacation and goes to rural Texas to investigate a series of unusual serial killings. There, his methods clash with the local authorities and the colorful cast of characters that live in the little town.This is not as good as the creepy ""Cabinet"" even though it has its moments. The tension and interest builds up pretty nicely towards a somehow half baked ending that disappoints a little bit.We will wait for Pendergast to return from vacation in ""Brimstone"""
3,"required reading, but...","If you, like me, became hooked on the character of Agent Pendergast through reading the absolutely brilliant and addictive ""Cabinet of Curiosities"", then you need to read this book... but only because it's now part of the canon. It's disappointing in many ways, and really only a step towards ""Brimstone"", the next book in the ""series.""Get it, read it, move on!"
4,More Pendergast!,"I thought STILL LIFE WITH CROWS was a ""good"" book, in general; what makes it ""great"" specifically is the character of Special Agent Pendergast. Hopefully, the authors realize they have a winner with this character and the more works they use him in, the better! I eagerly anticipate the next Pendergast novel to come out."
4,I never want to see Luray again.,"Still Life with Crows (Pendergast, Book 4)Well, this is a relatively old Preston & Child offering, at least to me. However, it has the right balance of mystery, thrills, horror & just plain, good old weirdness that made me wonder ""Why didn't I read this earlier."" Special Agent Pendergast is his usual ghostly, inscrutable self, much to my delight, but the array of supporting characters makes this installment in Pendergast's folio of the strange and dangerous cases unique. A page flipping good read. Bob R"
4,Good Book,"This is a good book, hard to put down and enjoyable to read. Takes the reader to the midwest in ""corn country"" and does a good job of describing true life rural people in their rural setting. I believe the same story could have been told with a third less words, which is my only reason for giving it a four star review instead of a five. This is my first read of these authors and I'll definitely be reading more of their works."
4,Masters of creepy suspense,"Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston are masters of bizarre creepy suspense, which they somehow make so believable that these books --you can't put them down. Here we have Special Agent Pendergast on vacation in a cornfield, being himself. Why do I love this remote, troubled, guy, himself so mysterious? Because we like that sort of person and want to really understand him and be liked by him. I have now read all of these novels except Dance of Death and then I will have the complete picture. I can only hope for more."
5,still life with crows by preston and child,"awesome book!! actually gave me goosebumps. writing was so vivid i could really put myself into the story. Pendergrast is so cool in every situation I actually found myself talking to him telling him to hurry up! Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are a force to be reckoned with and I am an avid ,and to say the least, picky reader. So turn out the lights, put your back to a wall and enjoy."
4,"Not their best, but good","I love the work of these guys: they are consummate masters of plot pacing and usually the plot is very imaginative (e.g., the memorable Riptide, and The Ice Limit). But this seems a relatively lackluster effort: the plot is a little weak, and the antagonist unlikely. Of course, there are mysteries & chills galore, and Pendergast always makes for an enjoyable read, but this is the weakest of the stories where he appears. (I think Cabinet of Curiosities would be the strongest, with Relic and Reliquary tied close behind). A must for fans (like me), but not the best intro to Preston & Child. Enjoyable, nonetheless."
5,Interesting. Enjoyable read.,"While not necessarily their best work with Special Agent Pendergast, this one is a good read. As to be expected the writing is sharp, detailed, and really puts you in the action. There are some instances though where one has to say that Preston and Child are reaching just a bit, a little too much technique shows. That being said, the novel is a really good one. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
2,"Sort of a ""The Hills Have Eyes"" Retread","This here's sort of a retread of Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"". It's been reworked as a serial killer mystery in a small rural Kansas village, with FBI Special Agent Pendergast appearing instantly on the scene while on vacation. I believe this is the 4th Pendergast novel and while I enjoyed the others quite a bit, I really couldn't wait for this one to end. A by-the-numbers thriller, with about as much life as the title implies. The SciFi/Supernatural element from the previous books is missing here as well. Nothing much happens in the continuing story framework, other than it seems someone else is in the house that Pendergast inherited at the end of the 3rd book. Recommend to skip this book."
3,Police aren't this dumb,"I just finished the book, and though it was very creepy and well written overall, I just can't seem to get over one thing: the fact the police all have half a brain in this story.The only person who EVER gets anything right is Pendergast. That isn't realistic, and it is kind of dumb. (Slight Spoiler) At the end of the book (This is how dumb the police are) an OLD LADY is able to take on two police officers. Give me a freaking break."
4,Good Until the 3rd Act,"This book was my introduction to Special Agent Pendergast. I have since gone on to read all his other novels (except Relic), but this one is my favorite. I think it is because of his pairing with local ""bad girl"" Corrie Swanson, for they make for a most unusual detective Odd Couple: him with his refined southern ways, and she being a foul-mouthed Goth.I have but two complaints against this book, and they both involve the 3rd act. First off, the climax, which takes place in a series of underground caverns, goes on far too long in my opinion. Then in the denouement, the killer, previously thought dead, makes one more inexplicable appearance. But these do not take away enough for me to not purchase it, which I am finally doing after having checked it out from my local library three times."
3,Best in the series,"This book was great right until the ending. Good pacing, believable situations, and a compelling story. I was just about to think that the other books I'd read earlier in the series were an aberration until this one had another one of its predictably crazy endings. I would've given this story 4 stars if the last 70 or so pages couldve been left out. The authors have some talent and can develop some intersting characters but they always seem to resort to one miraculous or absurd solution after another. What's next, a unicorn appearing out of the sky to rescue a falling Pendergast? Anyways, a good novel through most of the book, but be prepared to suspend any and all disbelief to get through the ending."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I read this book well over a year ago but i wanted to at least drop a quick review. I love Preston-Child books and this was a very fun read. The plot unfolds and leaves the reader questioning what is going on....then the author gives it to you. Its an amazing twist. Read the books that these guys have written. If you like one of thier books, you will love them all."
4,Pretty good,The beginning is a little slow but it gets going towards the end. I really like the hints it gives to some of the other books.
1,What?,"This book produces almost no facts to support its title.Don't waste your money, or at least buy a used copy."
1,Bias and Hypocrisy Thy Name is Alterman,"The Daily Caller's expose on the shenanigans of the Journo-list buffoons told me all I needed to know about Alterman, Klein, et. all....."
1,What Liberal Media Indeed!,"Let's see...the father of a Delta Force soldier who is posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in Somalia refuses to accept the medal from Mr. Clinton, telling him that he is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief...and it's not reported by a single major media outlet. A Republican Vice President misspells the word potato during a spelling contest after a card is handed to him with the word incorrectly spelled...and it's the lead story that night in 2 of the 3 major media outlets and the second story on the other. Naawww...there's no media bias. What could those members of the vast right-wing conspiracy be thinking?"
1,And if you believe this...,"As the old saying goes: ""Figures lie and liers figure"". This book has lots of facts that the writer stacks to prove his point--just like Johnny Cochran. Even as a life-long Democrat I wasn't convinced. Don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Preaching to the Pew,"There is never any Socratic search for the truth in this book as its major theme is a forgone conclusion. Never for a moment does Alterman doubt he has found the truth about the media. Like the Church Vicar, Alterman is preaching to his pew. His focus is narrow and never reaches beyond the members of his church.Socrates said, ""Whenever, therefore, people are deceived and form opinions wide of the truth, it is clear that the error has slid into their minds through the medium of certain resemblances to that truth.""...Alterman fails to see the wider world beyond to ""form wider opinions of the truth"" and, therefore, fails to convince his version of truth is more than just that or a resemblance to truth.In it, Alterman goes so far as to claim that certain public figures are dangerous to the ""political Public.""..."
1,A liberal columnist can't get it right,"This book is a weak attempt to disprove the obvious. Alterman's liberal bias shows through completely. I notice he didn't mention Dan Rather, who is definitely a liberally biased newscaster. ...This book is just another laughable attempt to give life to the silly notion of a vast right wing conspiracy.Alterman doesn't even mention interviewing techniques. Liberal newscasters and morning show hosts always give softball questions to liberals they interview, but are always confrontational to republicans and conservatives. But, addressing this fact would repudiate the thesis of his book, wouldn't it?Save your money."
1,Selective Evidence,Alterman selects his documentation as carefully for his work as Bellesles did for his. I feel that when objective review is applied he will be found to be just as accurate. He labels anyone who is not blatently Left leaning as Conservative and uses this to dismiss what America sees on it's televisions and front pages every day.
1,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing Mr. Alterman's evidence of a conservatively biased media, but he merely points to commonly known political pundits such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, etc... There is nothing new offered in the book that can't be examined easily by doing a google search on ""conservative"" and ""media"".Buy a different book and just borrow this one from the library..."
2,ok so the media is liberal and conservative,"Definitely worthy of the read if you think the media leans to the left. Otherwise, not worth the read.It opens up the idea that it really just depends on what source of media you are looking at. For example, if I am watching Fox News, I would expect conservative not liberal news."
1,Boo Hoo,"Once again, a collection of written chatter that is supposed to make some sense. To whom? I wish that so called journalists could learn to stop when they are ahead. My hope was to finally read an objective view on the media and not some paranoid filled comments strung together...forever. Alterman comes off as a whiner using juvenile statements and twisted half-truths to make his ""facts"" stand up. I'm just glad that I borrowed the book from a friend (poor guy) and didn't shell out the [cash].I do recommend it as a decent ""fiction"" book though!"
3,Claim of bias?,"Is this some sort of claim that the media is biased one way or another? It doesn't strike me as very likely that the author is going to be able to convince anyone either way, since people tend to have very strong opinions about these things - they'll either be reading it to support their own biases, or to ""know the enemy"", so to speak. Having said that, it could be an interesting read if you're interested in these kinds of things. I'm not myself, and can't really imagine reading this book under pretty much any circumstances whatsoever. I nonetheless give it 3 stars, since it would be unfair to harshly judge something I haven't read and have very little interest in."
1,Not accurate,"Until the media deals with Juanita Broaddrick, who Lisa Myers said was very credible and whose testimony caused Tim Russert to throw up, Alterman's fiction is just good for laughs.Bush is attacked at every opportunity on the evening news."
1,whine whine whine,"Frankly Ann Coulter is right and her book Slander describes professional LW whiners like Alterman with GPS guided precision.The majority of the media IS biased to the left. However to people like Alterman, it is not left enough. Think like Marx, Stalin, and Chomsky and you may be able to come to the same conclusion as Alterman. Think like the majority of Americans and you will scratch your head wondering what Alterman is in fact complaining about."
1,Was this book at all necessary?,"With glowing reviews posted from the New York Times and the New Yorker, to name a few, one can hardly imagine that there is any liberal bias in the media...I mean, come ON, the New York Times and the New Yorker? How right wing can you get!It's one thing if a book is created out of the author's beliefs, desires, whatever, but something else if it's just a mindless response to a more popular predecessor (i.e. that book by Anne Coulter.)I agree with a previous reviewer who labeled this book as propaganda...is anyone fooled by this?"
4,Liberal media myth debacled,"Eric Alterman argues in his book, what many of us have noticed for years. A pervasive loud conservative voice all over the media. Unlike Goldberg's ""Biased"", this is a well researched book and wonderfully presented for the reader to judge for himself."
5,Reminds me of crossfire,"Take a look at FOX news or msnbc and you'll see some far right wing people all over the place. I haven't read the argument about too many liberals in the media, but I wonder how the media could be without being a little liberal in its outlook.... The Bush people aren't questioned nearly as much as they should be by those who deliver the news - why is that?"
3,Only in America,"Alterman provides a workmanlike demonstration of the blindingly obvious: the feeble 'infotainment' - devoid of content and analysis - that passes for news in the U.S. is not manipulated by an evil 'liberal' conspiracy after all. What a surprise.It is hilarious (to a non-American such as this reviewer), and depressing (since the pernicious example of poor quality journalism as practised by the American media is aped in other countries, and the noxious low-brow broadcasts of CNN and Fox are omnipresent), that the author felt the need to write such a work.I would recommend this volume not for its refutation of a liberal conspiracy informing the presentation of news in the U.S. media, but rather as a work providing further evidence on how American popular discourse has become even more irrational and absurd than ever before."
1,Alterman does reference.......,"I think that to be fair, and to gain an accurate and complete view of the political landscape one should not only read this book but also the right-wing counterpart, Slander by Ann Coulter.If you read both books and do a quick search on lexus-nexus,you will realize something; while both authors use citations, Ms. Coulter does NOT present her sources out of context."
2,Suspicious,"I feel this argument is like trying to convince another whether the glass is half full or half empty. I think that a lot of us project our own suspicious insecurities onto the news that we watch. We can listen to either side's cries of conspiracy and take in valid points from both, without becoming unreasobly fearful and hysterically accusatory. But admitting this does not thrust us into the drama that a partisan war creates and therefore we feel compelled to choose a side. Choose if you have to, but consider what you might end up sounding like:(another reviewer writes) ""This shift has been strictly engineered, with maximum efficiency, by a large cabal of millionaire conservative wackos seemingly hell bent on creating a one party system for this country.""Sound a little paranoid? Maybe it is."
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","Easy to read and well-documented, this book does a masterful job of spelling out just how ultra-conservative our media has become. Alterman debunks the works of Ann Coulter and the author of Bias with insight and solid research. He also takes us behind the scenes of the news room and talks about the influence of money on journalism today. This is a book that needed to be written and that should be read by more people. In fact, I think it should be required reading in high schools and colleges. If our democracy is to survive, people need to know that the so-called ""news"" today is often anything but and to think for themselves. Years ago I believed the conservative myth of the liberal media, so during the Clinton impeachment I went looking for the liberal media and couldn't find it. This books fills in much of the gap and explains why and how the media got so conservative. Well worth your time and money.Highly Recommended!!!"
5,Honest look at the media,"Alterman makes a series of valid points - one of the most important being that while the nightly news (the focus of Bias) does have left-leaning reporting, that's not where most people get their information. Instead, many get their information from pundits and talk show hosts who seem to be driven merely by how they say things as opposed to if what they're saying is even correct.Other portions of the book also cover the press' coverage of the Clinton years and the effects of Richard Mellon Scaife, along with how the 24-hour news networks allow distortion of events."
1,If searching for facts this is A Disappointment,As a moderate with no party affiliation I have often been intrigued by the claims of the radical right that there is a Liberal media conspiracy. I was interested in examining the other side of the issue but this book is guilty of what it claims the extreme media such as Rush Lindebaum do. In short it argues from emotion and biased. The author had an opportunity to he intellectually honest and discuss facts with his readers but instead spent his time bashing the other side. All the rhetoric bores me on my fact-finding mission. I continue to believe that those standing on polar extremes do so because of a desire to win and wield power rather than search for truth.
1,An amazing case of totally distorting the facts....,An entire of book of misquotes and distorted facts. I am amazed that the author hasn't been sued for the misrepresentations that he has put forth as fact in this book.
1,More mindless drivel from Alterman,Save your money - you will see this one at the Dollar Store soon along with all of the Clinton co-conspirator books.
1,Misinformed Liberal Socialist,"Eric Alterman is delusional.There is unequivocal evidence that their is a media bias in the News Papers, TV, and Magazines. Another Marxist lie to distort facts."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!!!,yEAH RIGHT. THE LIBERAL LIARS ARE LYING AGAIN!!!! AL FRANKLIN GOES ON THE tv and says that only the people that agree with him should be allowed to live in America. GUESS WHAT STUPID? YOU ARE A TRAITER.
1,What a disappointment!,Basically all he bemoans is the marginalization of the hard left. Mostly a hypocritically slandering polemic.
1,Opinion wrapped in fact,"I read Mr.Alterman's book and was humored by his observations and opinions, then last night I saw him on a comedy talk show claiming that his book was fact, he then wnet on to spout anti-American propiganda, he got so far off base that even the liberal host stopped him and thanked him for his ""opinion"". ""Its not opinion, its fact"" Alterman cried.After seeing this I was disgusted, Mr.Alterman wrapped all is opinions in this book and slapped a cover on it, claiming it as 'fact'. This is not fact, he comes up with numbers and percentages that are incorrect, at one point he accually says that Al Gore did invent the internet and that the media tried to mar this. He is assuming all his readers are uneducated or just not paying attention."
1,"Conservative Pundits are Conservative, and Biased?","The title of this book is misleading: ""What Liberal Media? The Truth About Bias and the News"". It portends to tell the truth about bias and the news but it never addresses the bias in the news. What the author, Eric Alterman, tries to do is expose the conservative biases of conservative pundits. Well, for my money I didn't need a book to tell me that Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and O'Reilly are conservatively biased. If you enjoy the ranting of a very angry man then you'll enjoy this book. If you really enjoy the ranting of an angry man then you'll enjoy listening to this ""author"" give an interview.If you want a book about bias in the news media, try the book ""Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News"" by Bernard Goldberg. He's a liberal in seek of the truth, wherever the chips may fall."
1,Some readers are mistaken,"The reader from Lakewood, Ohio said ""One of the reviewers of this book - the one from Bristol TN - is a total idiot. One of his/her proofs that the media is liberal is that the French are liberal. Hello? Can anyone make any sense out of that statement?"".The reader from Lakewood, Ohio took this statement out of context. The comment was that the French along with Eric Alterman were so liberal and leftist, that in comparison the liberal couple of Bill and Hillary Clinton are considered moderate in comparison.This statement appear to be intended to show that different people come from different perspectives of liberal, moderate, and conservative. Then the reviewer from Bristol, TN went on to say that since Eric Alterman was so far to left of most Americans and liberals in particular, that Eric Alterman would view all media sources other than the leftist ""The Nation"" as conservative.The debate on liberal and conservative bias is based on your own personal perspectives."
1,worthless attack,"Like most liberal writings, this book expresses many thoughts but when they are examined under the eye of truth, they simply don't hold water. I don't recommend this book at all. I do not consider myself a republican or a liberal, but I do believe in expressing truth. If you do too, than don't bother wasting money on garbage like this."
1,A great example of Liberal Media Bias,"The author is preoccupied with the attire and physical appearances of Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham. (It's astonishing how much time he spends on this!) In the author's mind this somehow disqualifies them, never mentioning the educational credentials or work experience of either of these highly successful women.When he's not talking about Laura Ingraham's mini skirt, he rambles on making bold assertions without providing a single piece of supporting evidence. According to the author, Richard Nixon was more liberal than Al Gore, but he never gives an example of Nixon's alleged liberalism (or is it Gore's alleged conservatism)! This is just one example. There are numerous other unsubstantiated claims.The book never makes the point of its title, quite the contrary. The author spends most of the time whining about journalists that are more successful than he."
1,Laughable attempt...,"What you need to keep firmly in mind when reading this is that the author is a strident liberal, so his frame of reference for his subject matter is already skewed. There were many factual inaccuracies in his book that have been picked apart already ad nauseum, but the main point is that he tries to prop up his argument by comparing supposedly factual broadcast news to examples from conservative commentators. You simply can't take Ann Coulter, a rabid social conservative, and Sean Hannity, a Republican shill, and say that because this is so obviously right-biased that NBC's nightly newscast is centrist by comparison, because they aren't comparable media. I read it hoping that the absurd title was just an attention grabber but no, if anything it becomes even more ridiculous the deeper into it you get."
5,Well Docuemnted,"I never spent much time thinking about it, but I always sort of felt that the media was dominated by liberals. This book proved to me that I was wrong. This pretty well written, and very well documented work, establishes that the American Media is more conservative than liberal, and that it does not do a good job of providing us with fairly equal access to all reasonable points of view and the facts that support them, or do not support them, as the case may be."
4,Liberal who knows that all conservatives are not evil!,"This is a surprisingly candid appraisal of the media's move to the right (following the country's rightward movement). While it is partly a polemic, it is hardly a direct response to Bernard Goldberg's overstated book, ""Bias."" An iconoclast, Alterman hardly hews the party line for the liberals. It is a good read for both conservatives and liberals as long as one retains a good skeptical ear. I liked it very much."
5,Brilliant and Invaluable,"This is a first-rate piece of work, clear, tough, self-aware and often brutally funny. It's also remarkably fair, praising journalists as well as criticizing them--even praising the rare non-liberal journalist, such as Michael Kinsley, who is able to think for himself. I cannot recommend it too highly. My only criticism is that the book is not good for one's blood pressure, and you will finish it hoping never to encounter certain public figures at parties or on the street for fear of what you might say or do to them."
4,"O yes, it's Grimmer! :> but well worth it","About 20 years or so ago, I first sat down on a bookstore floor to begin the book, and hunted it down for myself years later. Some of the tales so haunted me that I had to find them and reread them to see if I recalled them rightly, or had confused them. Tanith Lee's style makes for a perfectly warped yet new angle to see fairy tales from. Was Snow White's stepmother Queen so wicked? Was Cinderella so abused? Did the Brothers Grimm ever make you ponder such things? If not, the Sisters Grimmer will!Please be warned, if the macabre and morbid are not your cup of tea, you won't like this. But if you can stretch your mind, allow other images and/or interpretations to be possible, lush and frighening that they might be - then I highly recommend the Princess-Royal of Fantasy. :> And if you've tried her Paradys books, that will prepare somewhat for this - not always as colorful, but as starkly mad.Enjoy!"
4,Gothic re-tellings of classic fairytales,"Tanith Lee provides a darker, more gothic feel to the classic fairytales we all know: Snow White is a creature of the night in ""Red As Blood;"" Little Red Riding Hood has meets a very different kind of wolf in ""Wolfland;"" Rapunzel's prince is more sinister in ""The Golden Rope;"" plus six othe re-tellings. Each one takes place in a specific time and place on Earth, mostly in the past - with the one exception being ""Beauty,"" Lee's re-telling of Beauty and the Beast, set on Earth in the distant future. Even thought the titles of the stories have changed, Lee makes it easy to figure out which story is being re-rold. It's a bit too dark for children, but for fans of horror and gothic tales, this makes a great addition to your reading list."
3,Devil worship and a whole lot of vaugness make for a book with only one good story,"I really thought I would like this book. I love Tanith Lee, and I love fairy tales, so it had to be good right? Well, no, it's not very good at all actually.Roughly 90% of the stories in this book have something to do with devil worship. Not that that's bad, but it got old fast and it did nothing to enhance the stories. Also, all of the stories feel like very rough drafts and are written in a deliberately vague way so that you can have mo idea what's happening most of the time. The take on these tales in this book isn't new; it's just weird and obscure.I can't say I'd recommend this. The last story is quite good, and for that the book gets three stars, but the other stories never make it above one or two stars."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Red As Blood contains a whole lot of fractured fairy tales, but not the Rocky and Bullwinkle kids' cartoon variety.Instead, Lee takes them and makes them darker, or weirder, or more horrifying and strange. She is someone that quite likely has more than the odd weird dream it would seem."
3,not the very best cluefinder game,this game is extremely long and gets boring. the fish within fish and the face within face get boring so quickly. a dull game
1,Does it really work on a Mac??,"The box says that the program is intended for PC and Mac users. We loaded it and it never worked for our Mac. Talking with friends, this is not an uncommon complaint. Sigh. At least we'll save money by not buying this series in the future!"
3,This is okay...,"It has a long story line which is very time consuming. However, it has some good math and language art related games."
5,Carl Sanders,"Understanding this concept of God's desire to see people prosper can be very liberating,especially to those who think being poor is next to Godliness.On The contrary.If your ready for a new way of thinking about you,God,and money read this book!You will not be dissappointed!"
2,Unreliable,Product worked as advertised on my G4 1.2GHZ desktop for about 2-1/2 months. Then it died. Replacement (RMA was handled promptly by a helpful Customer Service Dept at Belkin) arrived DOA. Try another product!
1,Make' em Talk,"As a former US Army Officer and US Air Force NCO, I have to say that this is an incredibly bad manuscript. The author touches little on any substanative military or psychological theory that might be of use to any professional member the military or law enforcement. This book is nothing more than a collection of the infantile ramblings and anecdotal, ""war stories,"" of an ego-inflated right-wing extremist. The content, organization and basic writing craft exhibited by the author, falls well below what is to be expected from a professional writer, not to mention a professional soldier. This book is not for the serious student or practitioner of interrogation. The book reads like the pure trash and tripe that comes out of a publication such as,""Soldier of Fortune,"" Magazine. As far as Mr. McDonald is concerned, I have this to say, you are an embarassment to both the US Military and intelligence profession. I want my money back!"
1,this book suffers from tunnel vision,"This book is not about military interrogation at all, although it starts off that way. This veteran is not writing anything with any literary integrity. Instead of being about interogation, this book is mereley a blind and gross salute to the U.S military. I am ex-military myself and I love my country more than anyone but this book is more about blind praise than anything else. my advice...don't buy this book. The type of arrogance in this book is why people hate America so much"
1,Make 'em Talk,"This book casts more light on Patrick McDonald's personality disorders than it does the the subject of interrogation. In the course of my 22 year career in law enforcement and corrections, I have never seen an instance where Patrick McDonald's loosely formed ideas would be relevant to an interrogation practitioner. Mr. McDonald comes off in this book more like a person who would more likely find himself in the position of being interrogated by a policeman rather than conducting an interrogation! From an academic point of view, Make'em Talk is not to be taken seriously. This is nothing but a venue for McDonald to validate his improverished ego and self-image by making himself out to be much more than he is. I deal with this same genera of pathological behavior in my work in counseling youth offenders."
1,Not a good read,"I agree with the other reviewers. This book is vague and was not worth my time. I couldn't wait to get to the last page just so that I would know, without a doubt, that there was nothing in this book of value."
1,Torturer,"This guy is/was a torturer. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib shouldn't be a surprise if an army employs people like McDonald. If you're accused of torture and human rights abuses, ""deny everything, admit nothing - and make counter-accusations."" Sounds like Rummy and the Pentagon brass read this book!I believe in free speech, but this is too much."
3,Surprised by the size,"Great resource. Although I was a bit surprised with the size of the book. It advertises itself as a ""Pocket Dictionary,"" but it is too big for most pockets. This company has smaller books that are more worthy of the ""pocket"" adjective."
3,late & cracking,"The book came in at the very end of it's estimated arrival date. The packaging was adequate, but the book itself was damaged on the spine. When I opened it some pieces of the cover flaked off of the bottom portion of the spine."
5,Great discussion of concepts,"The discussion of ""core"" concepts in this book was extremely well written and insightful. This is definitely not a stand-alone book for those interested in the inner workings of SQLServer as they relate to designing and optimizing databases. Rather, it gives a great foundation for moving on to those subjects through clear coverage of the data storage and architecture models as well as many of the great monitoring tools available to SQLServer7. All-in-all, this book is a great starting place for building an understanding of SQLServer and its underlying architecture."
2,GOOD INTRO--NOT USEFUL FOR EXAM PREP,"Possibly a good intro for a newbee, but not detailed enough to be useful for exam prep. Practice tests not rigorous enough.Minor errors indicate sloppy proofreading."
3,Complete but lacking,"It's a good book but it assumes you now the basics of ski waxing. I was trying to obtain a book to learn how to wax skis,and I am still looking. It's worth buying for the advanced procedures covered but you will have to find another book to learn how to ""wax skis""."
5,"Best Book on Cross-Country Ski Preparation on the Market""","I noticed your ad in a recent issue of Cross Country Skier and decided to check your website out. As a result thereof, I ordered through Amazon your book.After more than 50 years of cross country skiing experience, I can honestly say yours is the best book on this subject which I have ever read. I found your text extremely interesting and informative. You really know your stuff!I thought that I knew a point or two after taking the Swix waxing course, but I have now learned that I am still only an amateur when it comes to waxing to perfection.Hope we met some day! Good waxing!Richard W. Montague, Ebenhausen, Bavaria, Germany"
2,Like an Incomplete Brochure,"This book is good as an introduction to the HK small arms but not as a definitive guide. There are key pieces of false information, poorly researched history and extended areas of rewritten H&K; catalogs.If you are fairly educated on Heckler and Koch small arms I do not recommend this book; there is nothing special in this publication."
4,HK assault rifle systems,"I read this book, and it was helpful with all the HK assault rifles, subguns, and machine guns. If hit some of the assault rifles, but it more into the subguns, and machine guns. If you want a sub, or a machine gun, you may want to look at this!"
1,This work is not worth the effort to read.,"In surveying the arguments against the classical doctrine of eternal security offered by Corner, I see no convincing reason to opt for his ""conditional"" view of salvation. This book is literally laced with bad arguments and ad hominem attacks. For the serious student of biblical soteriology, one would be better influenced by someone who actually studies the Bible without an agenda."
4,Flapdoodle!,"Everyone seems to hate this volume. Personally, I think it was worth it just to see the extra bit about Chii, Sumomo, and Motoko. What did Chii forget?"
2,3 clip shows plus a single 2 minute long original,"The 3 clip shows that make up 98% of the content on this disc just aren't worth watching. The 2 minute long ""Chibits"" special however was a real delight. Unfortunately this works out to about $10 a minute for the original content. Pretty pricy for what you get.Buy this disk only if you absolutely have to see Chibits, or if you really can't stand having the alleged gap in your collection."
2,disappointed,i really loved the chobits series..one of my best animes which really touched my heart..the story is amazing..all you see is beautiful people..but i was really disappointed with this DVD..i thought there would be an ending story..after watching DVD # 6 i was dyin for this one to be released..to see what will happen..cus DVD 6 has a GREAT ending..but in this DVD all you see a repeat of all the 1 to 6 DVDs and nothing more..why would i wanna see all the flash backs since ive already seen them!..i mean..it was a waste of money...unless you want your collection to complete.
2,Terrible!,"I got this and watched it with a couple of friends because we love the series. However, I wish I would of read up more about it, because it turned out to be nothing but re-caps. In my opinion it's not worth it, even if you don't want to bother shelling out cash to get the last six.With the previous DVD's, at least you have the whole thing to watch. This one was just a quick repeat of everything that happened already. Just save your money."
2,Excellent examination of all availible sources,"Collins appears to be an expert on this topic. However I wish he would share more histroy with us. I understand that not much is known but the reader deserves more information. Unfortunately this is a 200 page bibliography which left me clueless on what happened in Spain during this period. This book should be titled ""A List of Chronicles"" I want my money back!"
4,rave,"This is a really wonderful book; Collins writes well and he has a very clear idea of what happened in Spain in the 7-8th century, which is not called the Dark Ages for nothing. Anybody with an interest in the period will love it."
3,Incomplete series of thought,"Murphey seemed having a hard time focusing on one subject before relating to another in this hard-to-read book. The time spans forced a forward-and-back and again type of story-telling , that's the order of the day in his work.I wouldn't recommend it for those new in this subject, but it's a challenge for the old-cracks. The argument on the fragile rule of the Berber dynasties sound solid enough but too few on the Septimanian questions."
5,NICE PRICE,I'm writing this review just to hope my husband would read it before my birthday. *Wicked* He shall know what to do. This is my dream piece and I would love to wear it every single day.
4,A nice story about blending single-parent families,"Yours and Mine is a heartwarming story of two single parents coming together and finding both romantic love, and family-love, through their daughters who are best friends. I loved how the friendship between the children, and the relationship between the adults and children, were as important to this story as the blossoming romance between Joanna and Tanner. What made this story standout is that conflict was realistically handled with humor, wit and good-natured teasing, rather than the unnatural and annoying hostile bickering that seems to dominate other romance novels."
3,Size & Return,As other customers have mentioned the sizes run VERY BIG. I bought this for a 5/11 160lbs individual and it was HUGE so we are turning the large for a medium (even considering a small). FYI the return is your responsibility (costs). Otherwise the product is very soft and the hood was the biggest selling point.
2,Bummer of a Deal,The fabric quality is poor. The ink is blurred. The diagrams do not cover my woman's size 9 foot as the picture shows. I was very disappointed.
3,"Socks are thin and really designed fro women, not guys !","I wish I had known that they were very light weight when I ordered them. Not horribly disappointed since they were a stocking stuffer but wish tehy had been a little more stout. But it was a fun response from the receivers, they loved them and thought they were funny."
1,Bad Handles,"I really wanted this to work, because I had worked out with resistance cords before, and this looked neat. However, I was unable to attach the handles to the cords. When you stretch the cord, it slips out of the handle. Also, the plastic clips seem really fragile and I was afraid it would break while I was testing it before I returned the product."
2,An unusually weak Lena and Olof Landstrom title...,"We own ALL the Boo and Baa books, ALL the Will books, ALL the Benny books, plus a few more as well such as this one. This story certainly is not comprehensible to a nearly five-year old, and I don't like it at all myself. But the drawings are terrific as usual.We don't mind the woman's liberation theme, but the story is just too complicated and ""adult"", it seems. Too bad, since my little one's babicka in Czech Republic actually has a henyard herself, and two roosters.....(hen = slepice in Czech..)"
4,"This product is great, how did I ever live without it???","I don't know if you're one of us, but if you have an overwhelming amount of business cards in your possession, then you are one of us. You collect and collect and collect, and there's never any organization to the madness that is the business card. It's the most widely used source of contact in today's business world, and Corex Technologies has found a way to read the card extremely accurate OCR, and then integrate the information into so many different products such as my Outlook address book, my Palm Pilot, and even to some phones!!!! I don't know how I EVER got along without my new CardScan 600C. A+ in my book"
2,Doesn't print pages as advertised.,"The Cardscan Executive advertises that it will print in all the typical planner formats, Daytimer, Dayrunner, Franklin etc. It doesn't do what it says. The right edge of the page is cut off losing important information like half a phone number or half an email address. Technical Support was no help, they said ""it's a defect with the program"". None of the advertised formats on the pull down menu worked, or using the edit format feature. Users cannot change the width of the fields. Other than that it's a pretty cool product."
2,"OK for Windows XP users, but NOT for Windows Vista","I have been using this CardScan for a while now and it has proved to do an adequate job however I recently changed to the Vista operating system and the scanner stopped working so I went looking for an downloadable update on the company website but was unable find any. I contacted CardScan by email and they replied that I would have to purchase their $80 (plus S&H) upgrade to get my unit to work with Windows Vista. All of the other hardware vendors for other products I use with my computer (Dymo LabelWriter, Neat Receipts, etc) either offered a free downloadable Vista update or an update for a reasonable charge. Because of this I did not purchase the way overpriced CardScan upgrade and can now only give this otherwise good product two stars. I will not be purchasing another CardScan product in the future."
2,"Like a kiss, fun but it doesn't last long!","Product installs easy and is easy to use. Placed 3 of these at front desk of medical facilities, scanning dozens of cards daily. Two have died after about 12-14 months service. Tried one a trade show and got about 80% of info into correct fields, so it does save some typing."
2,"Scans great, but problem with multiple users on XP","The scanner works great with execellent accuracy.Unfortunately the software does not work under XP for users that do not have administrator privileges. Corex claims that this is not a ""bug"" but rather you must be a ""power user"" (aka administrator) to use this product. After two fruitless hours of experimentation with changing access rights to the program file directories, I relented and elevated my user's level to administrator. After that the cards scan fine."

2,[money] Desk Cleaner,"I don't know about anyone else out there, but I realized after receiving a CardScan for Christmas, that I already owned two objects that currently (and still) serve as a replacement: a PDA, and fingers. This may be the world's smallest business card reader, but I've already got two attached to my head that work just fine, thanks."
4,Working just fine,"I chose this paper towel over others because it's small enough to fit on the side of my cabinet and it's inexpensive. This does the job - allows me to tear off paper towel sheets easily. I'm using the screw mounts - it's advertised to not leave any residue with the adhesive, but I was skeptical about that."
1,Horrible decision,"Recently moved into a brand new apartment and needed a towel holder. This one caught my eye because of the adhesive strips that were supposedly easy to use and would not leave any mark. I bought it, followed the directions for mounting with the adhesive to the letter, and less than four hours later I hear a crash from my kitchen. When I got out there I saw that one strip had stopped sticking, causing the holder to fall and the remaining strip to tear a chunk of paint out of my wall. So much for not leaving a mark."
3,okay,It was just as ordered and it came on time. It's plastic but seems like the quality is fine and it arrived on time.
1,Book Review,"For those of you looking for a way to improve your life, this is not it. I found the material unsubstantiated, and unfledged. I am selling it on EBAY for a buck."
1,Deceived title,There is nothing in this book really add any thing new to the concept how to become too rich. I think the only person who could get rich from this book will be the author. It's a very deceived title and why the author mention sex in the title? . I think you will know if you read the book. This is just clarification for how this book is not valued at all.
2,Obvious 101,"Although a catchy title, this book should have been named Obvious 101. There is only one real sure-fire way to get rich with the information given in this book...hit the lottery! This book does serve a purpose in that if any would-be entrepreneurs out there read this book and learn something new from it, get a job and find a mentor before you go it on your own and risk it all. Best of luck"
1,Don't waste you valuable time and money.,"Upon recieving this book I read it in approximately 3 hours. Not exactly harecore information. The book is too general. I expected to find some deep insight in to the working mind of a millionare. As well as some valuable info on running a successful business. As a small business owner I wanted more in terms of ""how to"", all that was delievered was basic reasons as to why people that work for others are not ""filthy, stinking rich."" If you are a serious business person, who's time is your most prescious asset, don't waste it on this book. No offence to the author, but in my opion this book is written on a third grade reading level."
1,waste of time,"After some research about the author, dishonest,self-serving and unethical are the only words that come to mind. I would not advise anyone who has even the lowest form of morals to either purchase this book or subscribe to the ideas offered by this author."
2,Great price but you get what you pay for,"I bought these becuase they were on sale and cheap, so if that is your goal they are fine. BUT the are very dark compared to other glasses (i.e. the Nikon Travelite V) and not terribly clear. Better glasses will capture light and make viewing easier. These only work well in bright light. Unless you are really boke, spend the extra money and get binoculars with higher quality lenses."
4,"Interesting and useful, though dated in spots","Sloane's book was among a number of guitar repair manuals originally published in the 70's corresponding with the folk and rock booms that made the instrument so popular. The book was written in collaboration with the Martin repair department at the factory in Nazareth, and for that reason alone it's an interesting snapshot of the state of the repair craft at the time. Pictures of spraying lacquer with no nose or eye protection and instructions such as ""insert a sheet of asbestos to protect the top"", might raise a chuckle and date the text a bit but Sloane's writing is clear and to the point. Some of the jigs may have been inproved over the years, but I'll bet most of the techniques described are still valid and in use in shops all over."
3,Quick comment,"Just a quick comment for the last review. The 'famous Italian tenor' who was the first one to sing in the U.S.S.R. was Mario del Monaco. He sang Don Jose in the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1959. Irina Arkhipova was his Carmen, and that's how her international career began (see Arkhipova's memoirs). Recording of their performance on the Bolshoi's stage exists, but I don't think it was issued commercially."
3,AN OK READ,"FROM THE BACK COVER:ABANDONED by Carolyn DavidsonThe sole survivor of a wagon train raid, Elizabeth Travis has been left with amnesia. Cameron Montgomery comes to her rescue and takes special care of her. But how can she desire him while she is a woman with no past?ALMOST A BRIDE by Cheryl St.JohnThe only unmarried woman in town, Charmaine Renlow has been waiting years for her beau to propose, and she's had enough. Maybe it's time to move on to greener pastures...like single father Jack Easton's homestead!HIS BROTHER'S BRIDE by Jenna KernanOnly a desperate woman would marry a man she'd never met, even if it was her dying husband's last request. But with a young daughter to protect, Clara Justice is desperate, so she accepts the proposal from Nate, the black sheep of the family..."
4,Almost A Bride by Cheryl St. John,"I have been waiting and hoping that Ms. St. John write about Charmaine Renlow who was an important character in her book Sweet Annie. When this book came out I was giddy with excitement because I finally got my wish! I was not disappointed ... well a little ... only that the story was way too short and should have been a full book on its own. The ending I felt was rushed. Other than that I really enjoyed it! If you liked this story, I would recommend you also read Sweet Annie. Sweet Annie is one of favorite books. Another wonderful book from this author is Joe's Wife.The other two stories Abandoned, by Carolyn Davidson was a good read. His Brother's Bride by Jenna Kernan ... I did not like the story ... sorry. If I could rate these three books separate, the results would be Abandoned a 4; Almost A Bride 5; and His Brother's Bride would be 0 or 1."
3,Three great things about this book!,"There are three things that I really like about this book:1. There are good illustrations that showcase step-by-step transformations of how each technique and tool was used to get to the ""end goal""2. There is a companion website that is fun to browse and helpful if you want some guidance with Adobe Illustrator but don't have the time or money to take a class3. The tips on the Blend tool were especially helpful for me; they gave me new ideas for what I could be using this tool for when constructing illustrationsMy personal preference for the style, layout and 'final' projects the book takes you through were not especially inspiring or attractive to me. For me, the layout of the book made reading it hard to follow and difficult to get engaged.A well written book, but I would reccommend that you peek through it at a local bookstore so you can see if it fits your style or not before you go out and purchase it."
5,great gift ideas,"A great accessory to give to people for their ipods- Helps it from getting scratched. I like to give it to people for their ipods for a gift- Birthday, Graduation, Holidays - they seem to always come up- Found that they are a great idea and they really work -"
1,Turtle Wax T-27R F21,Wax goes on easy.....it's liquid. Didn't like the way it comes off. Not easy removal. Had to polish and polish and polish. With a lot of effort it seems O.K. Not thrilled with this product.
3,crackling noise,"This machine was working fine, about 6 months back it started making crackling noise, it was very low, but enough to wake me up in the middle of night, so I moved it to downstairs office room.But from last week the crackling noise has increased and when I try to hear the recording the volume has become very low.I have decided to get another one because I could not find any other machine with 40 minutes of recording and multiple mail boxes. If any one knows how to fix the crackling noise. it will be nice to post it in another review. Howev this is a very good machine if the crackling noise problem is solved."
1,Unreliable,"From the start, I had problems with various kinds of flakiness - for example, it would spontaneously lose my messages. Recently I pinpointed the cause to be the socket where the AC adapter cord plugs into the machine. Slightly moving the cord or rotating the plug in the socket causes the power to cut in and out, resulting in memory loss. Another thing I didn't like is that it takes up more desk space than the average answering machine."
1,Barely intelligible playback,"Based primarily on reviews praising the clarity of the playback, I ordered this machine. I'm contemplating whether to send it back or just junk it to avoid the hassle. The nine year old machine I bought it to replace has better sound quality. Apparently the quality varies from unit to unit. It is a roll of the dice and I got snake eyes. On the unit I received, even the clearest messages are difficult to hear. Many are unintelligible. Even the pre-recorded announcements that tell you such things as how many messages are on the machine are so badly garbled they are difficult to understand. Why GE cannot make a machine with reliable sound quality in this day of advanced electronics is beyond me."
1,This product really does not work with DSL Service,"I had an answering machine that did not seem to work very well so I did some Internet searching and read the reviews and the GE Telephone Answerer seemed to be what I wanted. The reviews I read were all quite good. However, what the reviewers do not say and what GE or the company that now owns and sells GE electronics do not say is that this machine is virtually useless if you have DSL Internet services. I have tried it with and without the DSL filter and the results are pretty much the same. To put it bluntly the product really sucks in this capacity. [...] I think that a class action suit might be in order for people who have been ripped off like this because obviously they know this is a serious problem with this product and DSL."
1,I should have listened,"I should have listened to all those reviews that said this was a piece of junk - they were right ! No matter where you set the ""rings to answer"" it still rings 7 or 8 times and then rings once more after the machine picks up. Customer service is a bigger joke. It took 10 minutes of going through a phone tree and giving personal information to someone whose first language is not english. 10 more minutes while he reads the manual and then gives the recommendation that you unplug the unit for 10 minutes and try again."
2,Disappointed,"I wanted an answering system that didn't require me to lift up my phone to see if there were any message because I'd forget to do it, so I needed an external answering machine. I was surprised how few there were to choose from. I tried a RadioShack version, but it hung up on callers after a minute. The GE model I bought gives callers more time, but the audio quality is abysmal. I'm embarrassed that I present myself to callers with such primitive sound quality and I often have trouble, for the same reason, deciphering the messages that come in. Rats!"
3,"Good Product, however...","Worst part is when hearing messages from outside via toll saver, it does not tell how many new messages there are, and it does not end with new messages; when finished it continues to give old messages as well, with no option to not hear old messages."
2,Canned Voice went haywire almost immediately. Had to return,The product worked correctly for probably a week or two. Then the robot voice went completely haywire and made screeching noises you could not understand. Not happy.
1,Garbage,IT seemed to cut off bits of words when recording. I keep losing numbers and I am about to throw it away. I think it trunticates words in order to delete dead recording space. If the caller dont speak very loudly it deletes them. -*( Going to try ATT next.
4,needful,"This worked really well when we had the kids home as teens and college age. It separated out each person's messages and was a remedy for the household land-line. It was easy to program, easy to use, and reduced lost messages for all in the house.Now empty nested :-( and rarely use it at all, but it was a good purchase at the time."
1,Mine didn't work.,"It will answer the call, then after a few seconds give the caller static. From the listening end, the sound is so scratchy, it's impossible to understand the messages. I will be returning this item."
2,Pretty good value,"It's perfect for what I need it for. My parents snowbird and it is handy to have 4 mailboxes to catch the voice mails for them. The sound quality of the outgoing greeting and incoming messages are more than adequate. This is my second one I have purchased - the old one got ""fried"" when we had a power surge when the electric company was restoring power to the city after the severe October storm here."
1,the best sound ...,"This little digital machine is supposed to have the best sound of all the digital answering machines, right? It's sound ... :(I don't know of an answering machine now-a-days that doesn't sound pathetically garbled. It is hard to believe people are actually marketing this stuff. It ..., and badly at that.I would choose an old tape system in a second over the now ubiquitous digital ones."
1,Not the best answering machine,"at first this machine worked but then...after changing the battery out it continued to say ""BATTERY LOW"" after each message was replayed. Also volume level for recording is not the best. Not a good buy"
3,Good for the most part,"I have had this for a few years now. It replaced my computer program MSPHONE that had multiple voice boxes but didn't work with XP. For the most part it worked well but the voice quality seems to be going down hill lately although I am getting more cell calls now.If you want to make your small business look bigger by utilizing multiple mailboxes then this is the machine to use. Sound quality is sub par though so I am dreaming of a different brand w/ multiple mailboxes. Until then I am stuck.BTW, I was successful in setting it to answer on 4 rings and putting it after a Brother MFC5840CN All in One which successfully answers faxes with the TAD on!!!!Lucky Me."
4,Answering Machine.,"My old stand-alone answering machine was going bad. Since I already have all the phones I need, I wanted another stand-alone. After reading reviews on several, I decided on this one. It was easy to program, has satisfactory voice quality, etc. and is a good product for the price."
2,Answering Machine,"The machine was delivered as promised. The machine design is waht Ineeded, however, once installed the play-back volume was so low, itwas difficult to hear messages. I have ordered an audio amplifier in hopes of making this a functional unit. (I do have a hearing problem,so am not sure if this is my problem or the machines - or a combinationof both?)"
4,GE Digital Answering,"This is the only Answering Machine out there with 40 minutes of recording time. Why no other company makes one is beyond me, but when we had only tape everyone made 30 - 60 minute record time. This machine has all the functions including rapid advance and skip or reverse and repeat, plus four mail boxes. Clear recording sound. No static (like other reviewer reports). Wish the other makers would recognize that some people need longer message recording time."
4,This is a Very Good Product,"I don't get all the negative reviews. I spent over 7 hours researching answering machines; it came down to this GE model and the AT&T; 1726. I decided on this one because I wanted 4 mailboxes, and I like the way I can leave a message for another mailbox right at the machine... also, I trusted GE more than AT&T.;Anyway,it's fine, works very well. Yes, the sound quality isn't quite as good as devices that use tape, but it's still very clear - remember, it's not meant to be a stereo system! Also, I noted all answering machines have many negative comments, so don't be alarmed, the devices really do work."
2,Crackling problem,"I see a lot of good reviews here. I must admit that the answering machine has a very good interface. The problem is that a few months after I bought it the speaker started making this crackling sound. It sits on a desk where we're working and it's very annoying to listen to this continuous random crackling noise. It was inexpensive, so I just bought another one. A few months later, the new one started doing the same thing! I assume there was some sort of manufacturing defect. I just can't figure out why I don't see anyone else mentioning this problem. Maybe this issue has been fixed by now, but let this be a warning that yours may do this too."
2,"Great features, but unreliable","In terms of features & price, this answering machine is one of the best deals you can get. With 4 separate mailboxes and 40 minutes of digital recording time, what's not to love, right? Well, after less than a year of use, the answering machine no longer answers incoming calls. After 4 rings, the outgoing message begins to play from the speaker, but the answering machine never picks up! It took my wife and I several days of not getting any messages to figure this out. Who knows how many important messages we missed because of this? Very infuriating.We have since replaced the answering machine with a Sprint SP-812 that we picked up used from Craigslist.org for $10. The SP-812 only has 1 mailbox and 12 minutes of recording time, but at least it reliably answers the phone... and that's the most important feature of all."
1,Disappointing results,"I purchased this unit from Amazon after reading many machine reviews.This unit was not rated well, but most answering machines are not, I took a chance. As predicted, it worked well for 6 months, then stopped answering and just hung up on calls. I contacted GE/Thompson via web site and got a run around blaming the problem on my phone. A phone reset did not correct the problem with the answering machine. Then they provided a long distance number (no 800# in the 21st Century ?, says sonething about their support) that never did ring, it's been busy for 3 weeks. Poor product, dismal support, Buyer Beware."
2,WHY NOT TO BUY GE29869GE2,THERE'S NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THIS MACHINE AND THE OLD PANASONIC THAT LASTED 12 YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS. THE SOUND ON THE GE IS TERRIBLE AND OFTEN MESSAGES ARE JUST A GRATING MUFFLED BUNCH OF UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS. THIS WAS RATED BETTER THAN OTHER MACHINES OUT THERE THESE DAYS BUT THAT IS TRULY A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS.
3,Decent answering machine with mailboxes,"I read other reviews that included complaints about the quality of the sound (of the outgoing message and received messages). These complaints are very valid. The quality is POOR, but unless you have auditory processing difficulties, the quality won't interfere with listeners' comprehension. The machine is fairly compact in size. When you play back the NEW message, the machine will automatically play back the old (saved) messages - a bit of a nuisance, but you can stand there and skip them by pushing the forward button repeatedly. It's certainly not a great answering machine but there are few choices out there for machines with multiple mailboxes. Be aware that if you get an automated call (which we recently received about a medical appointment, so it was important), it will go to mailbox one. Not bad, not great, acceptable and does the trick. I am NOT sorry I bought it."
5,Double Happy,"What I really needed for my small business was a replacement for my 2-Line digital answering machine. Alas, there were none to be found. After a long frustrating search, my final solution was to purchase two single line machines. This model turned out to be a great value (total cost was a fraction of what I had considered spending), and both my units are working well without any problem. If I were redesigning the unit, I would add a 2-line version, and provide attachment points on the bottom to mount the unit on the wall."
3,GE 4 mailbox ans machine,"The memo button did not work (ever). I called customer service and they had me unplug for 10 min to reset, still didn't work. I replaced with another and the memo button didn't work in that one either. It's a great idea, but never got it to work."
1,Total waste of money,I had this machine for about 3 months before it just stopped taking messages. The greeting would answer and it seemed like it was working but I'd have people telling me it was cutting them off after about 5 seconds and never take the message. I wondered why I hadn't had any messages on it for about a month!I'm wishing I could find an answering machine that was worth a darn.
1,A good functions but gives off static. & other problems,I have bought and returned this machine two times . It has a good feature set but loses settings even with battery backup. The other problem is that it there making static noises all the time. It doesn't matter how close to the 2.4G phone it sits but it just makes noise all the time. In a small apartment this is a fatal flaw.
3,GE Digital Answering machine,"In general, the unit works well. The only problem I have is that the voice announcing how many messages is difficult to understand."
3,Poor Voice Quality,"The speaker produces a very poor quality voice. I thought the first unit I received was defective, but when I was sent a replacement, the replacement was just as bad. Reducing the volume on playback helps somewhat. I kept the unit because I needed a multiple-mailbox system and did not want to pay a lot for it."
4,GE 29869GE2 Digital Answering System with 4 Mailboxes,Very good machine. Great for those with the need for up to 4 separate mail boxes.Easy to set up. Has simple remote access. Battery back-up in case of power failure. Worth the price.GE 29869GE2 Digital Answering System with 4 Mailboxes
1,Piece of junk,"After only a few months this machine started to malfunction. When someone would call it would play 2 seconds of the outgoing message, then disconnect them. Could not problem solve - am now looking to GE for a refund.DO NOT buy this machine"
4,Beeperless answering machine,My only disappointment is it doesn't sound a beeper when a message is received. So I am considering buying a Uniden answering machine with 3 cordless phones and an answering machine that gives continual audible indication that a message has been received. Our answering machine is in our computer room so we miss calls occasionally.
4,Great for the price,"I've been using this answering machine for several months a it's working as advertised. My only complaint is the out-going message can not be turned off, so on every call you hear your message and that gets pretty tiring."
