5,buyer beware,"you'll like this movie. One does have to suspend their beliefs to some extent in this. The reason for that has to do more with technology. One could look up someone on the net, though even that try isn't always successful. I love the way time moved in this movie and the realizations of people as they realize how they exist in each others time with each other and apart. I love how these two people are there for each other with just a simple letter. They doubt and yet they don't take chances. There are some scenes you can see from a mile away but that doesn't matter. The journey is what matters and this film addresses that splendidly.Relationships of architecture and how it relates to our lives and where live, parents, siblings, loneliness, loved ones are looked at. There are some very funny moments.I am buying this one when it comes out because I love the time aspect as well as the relationship aspects. It was worth it."
5,Great movie!,"Case and DVD in perfect shape. I've seen this movie about 7 times! Love it! It always makes me think, trying to figure out how it's possible. I could watch it and then watch it again the next day!"
4,Fun film,a playful romantic/fantasy movie. I liked watching the two main actors in this film. Wife say it for the first time and thought it was fun
3,an OK film,it had Bullock... that's why i owned it......no more reasons...and it was nothing i expected... it was a lot better... it had that twist... and pretty confusing too... but anyways... an OK film for the nights.
2,Enjoyable for anyone with a skull-full of mush,"Ridiculous, saccharine, marshmallow fluff. Being a resident of Chicago I watched this movie for the exteriors and the interior of my neighborhood bar, The Green Mill. The degree of implausibility makes this one pretty hard to swallow. This director should seriously have his dramatic license revoked. Bullock's forlorn mumbling and Reeves' stilted monologues make this ""endearing"" film unendurable. The supporting plots of her mother and his dad do little to buttress this split screen gibberish. I never like to give completely negative reviews so I'll leave you with this. The costumes were very believable and the part of Jack the dog was ably played."
3,More far-fetched than just the time machine mail box,"Cute idea & certainly not a bad movie, but how their relationship develops is unbelievable. But the movie does a good job of not making the time travel letters cheesy."
5,Beautiful and moving movie!,My sister and I watched the movie at theater and we love it! The ending was very moving and there were no dry eyes in the room. Best Picture!!! Likely true love and wait for the right person for your life. I would say that Keanu and Sandra are the best actor/actress in the movie and they did wonderful job. I would love to live in the lake house someday with my own house design. I am looking forward to buy Lake House DVD and watch it anytime I want.
4,WOW Five stars- I accidently put four,"That is all I have to say about this movie. My best friend and I went to see this movie in theaters. For like two or three hours after it was over I still couldn't stop talking about it.This is one of the most romantic and moving films I have ever seen in my entire life. There is not much else I can say. I almost cried while watching this. The ending is amazing.The chemistry between Keanu and Sandra is astonding. They make the perfect couple. If you are a hopeless romantic and enjoy movies that make you happy and sad at the same time, then this is the movie for you.I am sure that you will love it. Yes, if you have a brain the size of a peanut, it may be a little confusing. But you will eventually figure it out and will love it.As you watch it, it will slowly climb up the charts that contain your top movies, until at last if only momentarily, it will be number one.WOW"
5,Incredible Picture on HD DVD and a great Movie!,"First, I'm prevewing this HD DVD combo version of this film.This is a very unusual story. It's interesting and romantic. I can't reveil the content of the story without spoiling the enjoyment of watching it. It is a creative movie with new ideas, perhaps never attempted before.The HD DVD picture quality on this combo version is absolutely awsome on my 101"" projected screen via HDMI on my Toshiba HD-A1. It does display film like quality and the transfer was clean.The standrad DVD version (on the back!) is also sharp. Well worth the money!"
4,I'm not the brightest lightbulb.,"I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. How could I not? It's mystical! I love the plot, the romance, and Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses and Keanu is easy on the eyes.The thing is--and maybe it's because I'm not the brightest lightbulb in the bunch (which is very possible)--but I had a hard time following the story at times. Keanu lives in 2004 and Sandra lives in 2006 and keeping track of what's going on in their lives, letter writing, and romance can be confusing. Figuring out the goings on of that damn dog still drives me nuts!I have watched it twice and that helps a lot and I enjoyed it more the second time. I think I'd like to watch it a few more times and maybe draw out a timeline of the history of these two people (and the dog)and hopefully it will all come together.Away, I give it 4 stars and I reccomend anyone watch it. I got the gist of it enough to still find it very enjoyable and satisifying. Make sure you have a box of Kleenex nearby."
3,"Good, but not Great.","As romantic comedies go, this one is definitely more of a romance than a comedy. Don't get it if you want to laugh, get it if you want to cry. However, the plot is good, Bullock does a great job acting (as usual), and the setting will draw the artisticly minded into the film.Reeves however, is not meant for romantic films. I just didn't see his acting as sincere usually, or good. However, if you can look past that, the movie is very sweet because it's not suggestive and appreciative of real love."
4,Enjoyable!!! Just get out of reality,"OK, I love Sandra Bullock (she's had ""work done"", sigh - I hope it losens up a bit), I found the story line enjoyable - a touch of science fantasy made it an interesting plot. The side plots were obviously thrown in to add length to the movie and were rather trite. As for Keanu, I don't believe he can act and he should stick to things like The Matrix.However, I gave it 4 stars, because even with the major flaws, I enjoyed it and would watch it again - that being a key rating factor for me. Also, the ending actually came as a surprise to me - I can usually figure those out after the first 5 minutes or so. And the hospital parts of the movie were good. It's the Keanu's dad subplot that flops."
5,You won't be disapointed!,"This is a really great movie. I wasn't sure if Sandra and Keanu would pull it off as a romantic couple again, but they sure did! I loved this movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more when it was done."
3,Not too impressive,I wouldn't recommend this movie because it really isn't that entertaining or good. The script was very poorly written for starters. The voice over parts are rather silly and hardly read with any real interest. The music is just plain terrible and thw acting is rather bland.
2,Very confusing,I think they started with a good idea for this movie then couldn't figure out how to film it so that it isn't just totally confusing. It's charming of course as it was meant to be and the characters are sympathetic but it just never really gets off the ground as story telling. Either it's a fairy tale or it's not. They couldn't seem to make up their minds.
2,Disappointed,"While Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are an enjoyable couple sharing a time-traveling mailbox, I could never get past the mystery of how two people in two different years could be together for their romantic moments. I was too distracted by the time-lapse mystery to really enjoy the movie."
4,The Lake House Video,I have not seen the video as it is a gift but hopefully it will be fine. It arrived on time. The paper cover had a tear but the video looks great.
4,Screamingly funny!,"Anna Russell is truly an original. She makes music forms (the art song, the madrigal) hilarious by pointing out, simply, the truth about them. It helps to know the art form, but isn't necessary."
5,Anna Russell Again,"We enjoyed this comedy CD very much. Anna Russell had an amazing ability to adapt her voice to any form of music, as she demonstrates when taking off various 'modern' music styles of her time (and earlier). She is also an excellent humourist."
2,deceptive ad,"Potential puchasers, beware.The audio quality of this CD is rather poor, but the worst is that it is sold without the original booklet which included the complete texts of Miss Russel's creation. A shame especially for those whose English is far from perfect.This should be clearly stated in the ad, but it is not."
2,Hardly any opera!,"When I listen to Anna Russell, I want to hear about opera. This CD is not an opera CD."
4,Tribute to an Opera God,"Despite some bad-quality tracks due to age and poor/live recording, this is by far one of the most complete collections of the songs that have made Luciano Pavarotti famous throughout the world. Listening to these three cd-s, it is obvious why this man is rated as the greatest tenor of modern day. And the fact that his career has spanned four decades only reinforces that belief. If ever there was a collection of the best opera pieces written for and performed by a tenor, this would be it. These cd-s have everything from ""O Sole Mio"" to ""Nessun Dorma"", demonstrating the full operatic range and magnitude of Pavarotti. An excellent choice for any opera lover, this collection will NOT disappoint you!"
5,This is an extremely important Civil War source book.,"Grisamore's memoir is an important source of information on the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the Civil War. Because he was a quartermaster, his story is a unique one because few quartermaster officers left memoirs. The book is full of humor as well as little known episodes of the war. Grisamore was a native of Indiana but felt strongly enough about the Confederate war effort to join the army and risk his life."
5,Get it now...,"BMG has been dumping stuff right and left, or sending it off to labels like Opera d'Oro (e.g. the Albanese/Bjoerling ""Manon Lescaut"" - cheap, but includes no documentation). This version has the complete libretto, and the performance is top-notch. This is the kind of role Moffo did so well, and Bergonzi is unmatched in early/mid Verdi. The days are long gone when RCA and London (sorry - BMG and Decca) routinely turned out recordings of this quality. Get it before it disappears, or is degraded."
3,Sitting comfortably between prog and pop...,"As other reviewers have alluded to, a release leaning much closer to pop sentiment than progressive, with Paul Menel's vocals considerably weaker than Peter Nicholl's, and song construction far less complex and satisfying than on later albums.To my ears, the music on this CD is evocative of ""Songs From the Big Chair"" era Tears For Fears, and indeed, Paul Menel sounds a LOT like Roland Orzabal, although Orzabal's voice commands better pitch and timbre.Some fine moments to be heard, granted, but if you're new to IQ definitely pass on this one and pick up ""Subterranea"", ""Dark Matter"", ""The Seventh House"" or ""Frequency"", any one of which are far, far superior to this CD."
3,Blimey Kirk,"Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but AYSC is not in the same league as Seventh House. AYSC is an OK album. It does have two excellent long tracks, a couple of turkeys, and some in between. Polished production. This was a treading water album really. I suspect they might have split up, had Menel not left to allow Nichols to rejoin."
2,Too Difficult a System,"Although there is some interesting, useful ad fun tips (the Need v. Want game is great), the whole system is too difficult for a working family to use. I'm sorry, but having a 6-year-old pay ""taxes"" is over the deep end. And so is paying interest on your child's savings jar. (That's what banks are for.)"
5,Both of my children love this book,"We found this wonderful little board book at our library when my daughter was around 2 years old. She loved it so much that we bought her a copy of it. My son is now 2 years old, and he asks for this book all the time. He completes part of it as we are reading (singing, actually), especially ""quack, quack, quack,"" and ""sad mother duck."" What I like about this book is that the ducks do something different on each page, the illustrations are terrific, and it's a very interactive book. My kids love it!"
5,My 17mo old loves this book!,"My 17mo old DD absolutely loves this book! We got it out at the library and read it at least 3-5 times a day. Definitely adding it to her wish list for Christmas. We alternate between reading and singing, plus have DD help by doing the duck calls. Highly recommended book!"
1,Miltary Combat Megaset,"It is hard to review this product since it has not yet been received. We ordered it Dec 11/11 and have waited patiently but haven't received it yet. Disappointing as it was a Christmas gift.Thank you, Tracy Morey"
1,Military Combat Megaset (Battle 360 Season 1 / DogfightsSeason 1and 2 / Dogfights of the Future) DVD,"Battle 360 Season 1 and Dogfights Season 1 and 2 are great, however the (Dogfights of the Future) is still not available. Order the complete pachage with care, I just ordered the Battle 360 and Digfights Season 1 and 2, completely happy with this purchased."
3,ggreat film - no subtitles,"this film has not the promised subtitles. I saw it years ago with german subtitles and it was an impressive experience, but only with a few lines every 2-4 minutes you cannot follow the movie, only if you are a spanish speaker. I can understand a little spanish, but not enough to relax, and in Austria the understanding of spanish is not that great that you can watch the film with friends."
4,Men with Sticks and other arresting imagery,"In the end, there IS hope and salvation. I was lucky enough to view this film in the fashion it was meant - in good company and on a projection screen of a small back room in a local bar. Lush colors, great soundtrack, and a compelling plot make this one a winner! Watch for a child on a tricycle..."
4,War is Hell,A quite riveting fictional account confirming true historical accounts that WWI was the worst of all possible wars with its description of trench warfare. The use of gas is alluded to but not described. The love story emphasizes the fictional nature of the book.
2,"interesting time period, poor character development","I was very interested in the romantic setting, I enjoyed learning about WWI, but I felt NOTHING for the characters. It also tends to be a bit too sappy in parts..."
2,Far from Literature,"I found this book under Literary Fiction, read a few of the first reviews, and then read a sample. I must have suffered a mini-stroke somewhere along the line because I actually bought this expensive book and quickly found it unreadable. And then began the remorse for money wasted. The writing is stiff, self-conscious, and unnatural. The characters are cliched, as are the love and war scenes. If you read to be titilated this might be your cup of tea. If you read to enjoy something ""novel"" and creative do not buy this book. It is not literature but an average grade ""C"" attempt at it."
5,An extrodinary book,"The novel moves from interesting insight to grand commentry at a pace that pulls the reader in. I had avoided reading this book for a long time but when I began I couldn't stop. The main character is so changed by what he experiences that the reader changes with him. I've since read Charlotte Gray and The Girl.... which expose the brilliance of this novel, in that they cannot match it for sheer scale. The other two are good but this one is by far the best. Read this as soon as you can, then The Girl...and then Charlotte Gray. Each is linked by the great wars but each has its own personality. Birdsong will undoubtedly leave you hungry for more, and will leave the biggest mark."
4,beautiful read,"Why is it beautiful? The descriptions, the flow, the depth of characters and their needs, drive, resiliency. The novelty of reading about a war time I have never know much of, the living in trenches and underground tunnels, the love that humans show one for another, even while they hate for reasons beyond themselves or of their own making. 1. Stephen is trapped underground as retreating Germans blow up a tunnel of their own. He works to free himself and tunneler, Jack father to John who dies of diphtheria in England only to be found by Germans. When these men embrace underground in recognition of their common strengths it is also to come up and find the war front has finally moved on and the war over... 2. Jeanne is so good and caring to Stephen, even when her sister has not loved him for a long time 3. Stephen hangs on to goodness and kindness! 4. Elizabeth has a baby at the end and the honor of that gives a wonderful tied ending to and peace to the reader!"
4,Splendid,"This book is rather rocking for lots of reasons. For one it DOES have a plot (i mean, WW1 is enough isn't it?) and for another, Stephen is such a complex character, to be honest, you don't need many other characterisations. One thing i don't get is the love between Stephen and Isabelle. Surely it's not love but lust. Then again, i'm naive. Oh and the war scenes: if they were shown in a cinema they'd be touching on Saving-Private-Ryan-esque.Rather spiffing, one might say, old chap."
4,"A moving inquiry into one's ability to survive, and why.","Faulks succeeded in demonstrating the dehumanization of warfare by creating an underground world filled with horror and yet completely believable even to someone who has never experienced such a place. The notion of this vile place existing just beneath the so-called normal world adroitly juxtaposed the two realities of war: those who fight it, and those who don't. He managed to reduce his characters to their most fundamental elements and yet allow me, the reader, to resonate with their eagerness to survive in spite of it all. At times I felt like I couldn't breathe as I read about the tunneling. This book gave me so much to think about. It's the best book I've read in a long, long time."
3,"Well written, but too much detail on trench warfare","This book is well written, but has too much information about trench warfare. The first part of the book was very interesting, but then changes over in part two to World War 1. It may be a great book to read for men, but I don't think I would recommend it for women."
2,Try Charlotte Grey instead,"Faulks' book ""Charlotte Grey"" (Not yet released in US, I think) was a much easier read, with more action and characters that are more easily understood. Birdsong is hard to follow, and the characters seem stiff and uninteresting."
1,Sebastian Faulks aka Jackie Collins,"After reading this book, I can only conclude either that Faulks' family members also happened to have reviewed his book, or that he knows deep, dark secrets about all of them. This book is simply awful. Farcical love scenes, ridiculously gory battle scenes, undeveloped characters, a nonsensical transition to a descendant's search for her past --""Gosh, I wonder what could be in these old trunks!""-- this was a complete waste of valuable time. I actually threw this book away."
2,Much To Do About Nothing,"Avoid. This book is not worth your time or money. The first thirty pages are REAL SLOW and I had to force myself to keep going in hopes of it getting better. It didn't. The characters are boring and underdeveloped. The writer sends way too time on trench warfare and, while its supposed to be a love story, I saw precious litle of it in the book. Most of the activity is pointless and leads nowhere. The ending leaves you unfulfilled and puzzled. Why did he use so many words to say nothing?"
2,bored and unimpressed,"I was very unimpressed with this novel. Yes, the war scenes were well written, but there was just too much of the same thing. I also do not feel that the novel actually tied all of the characters together well. The ending was so far-fetched. You could tell it was a man writing about female characters. I was reading this book for a book club, but probably would not have had any desire to finish it otherwise. It should not be considered a ""novel of love and war""- it should be considered a novel of war with the occassional female character thrown in. The only person I would recommend this to would be a man who is very interested in reading war scenes, and then I would tell him to skip the first part and the 1978 parts, and just read the war scenes all in one sequence."
5,"""Thought provoking""","I have chosen this book for my A-level coursework, I have never studied any aspect of the war before I only had knowledge from films such as ""saving private Ryan"" Anyway it truly opened my eyees to the sacrifices that were made in the war. Faulks' captivating and distressing prose plays on the heart strings, contrasting love and the evil that man is capable of. The suffering that took place should NEVER have to occur again . I think this book makes you appreciate your own situation more, and because of this quality, its a very influential read."
3,Faulks succombed to a cliche 19th century fate for Isabelle.,"Faulks wrote a novel of war masterfully, his erotic writing was captivating and convincing. However he really failed in his treatment of Isabella. First he maims her with a shell: bad girl having deepily satisfying sex outside of marriage. If that isn't enough punishment she falls in love with a German officer and then dies of influenza. Maiming a sexually active woman is something Zola or Hardy would write. This twist on her fate colored my whole opinion of the novel. Surelly he could have found a more original way to dispose of his ""woman problem."" Giving her over to the enemy would have been dramatic enough."
4,Lovely,A great book with some truly horrific detail. Enjoyed very much. I look forward to more of his in the future.
5,"Haunting, mesmerizing, moving ~ Perfection","A book that you will not want to put down.. One of the most beautifully written novels that I have ever had the privilege of reading. The love affair stirs your soul, the description of war will break your heart. This is truly a novel that you will want to read more than once. You will not be disappointed."
1,Wordy and unconvincing,"I read this book expecting a wonderful tale of love and war. The love scenes turned out to be much ado about nothing except over the top arousal..The war scenes were so gory as to leave nothing to the imagination. The book could have been about 200 pages shorter without so many long, vague adjectives and the overuse of the made-up word ""normality."" There wasn't much of THAT in the book. Why did Isabelle leave Stephen? We'll never know. Why the sudden attack of scruples? Why not tell him the whole story instead of torturing him with Max? We'll never know. If you want to read books of real impact about WW1 read Pat Barker's trilogy!"
3,"Good, a little slow, but interesting and horrifying at the same time...","This book was given to me by someone who knows I love historical fiction. The detail on the war was incredible, very scary....."
5,"Mr Faulks, this is a blinder!","'Birdsong' is a wonderful journey through the mind. At first it is steamily erotic, and then it is truly horrific. The sense of suffering in many parts of the book is very real in places. The characters that Faulks has created gradually grow in the readers mind, causing the bessotted reader to feel real compassion with the characters concerned. I strongly recommend this title. Although his 'sequal' to this (Charlotte Gray) is an outstanding piece of literature, it cannot quite live up to the high standards left by this materpiece. Faulks' ability to take key events from both world wars and entwine them into modern understanding and clarity is sometimes almost unmatched in places."
4,Almost brilliant,"This book is almost brilliant, but just misses. Why ? Most of it is wonderfully done - but the contemporary sections are simply not as well written, and after the intensity of life in the trenches, I did not feel as engaged with the modern characters.I think this is also partly due to the excellence of Faulks descriptive writing which works better describing the Somme than Twickenham.However, the ending, set in the present, does pack an emotional punch and connects past and present in a satisfying and uplifting conclusion."
1,A perfect beach read!,"I had no objection to the novel, other than that it was hailed as an extraordinary work of art. To be fair, the war scenes were some of the best I'd ever read, but the writer spoiled them with his trite and unconvincing portrayal of the affair between Stephen and Isabelle, and by his seeming inability to create a single solid female character."
2,Exhausting,"This is one of the few books I have ever abandoned midway through. I managed to slog through 235 pages until Part Three and then ran out of steam.Throughout those pages, I felt no connection to any of the characters, I found much of the dialogue either wooden or unbelievable, and while the writing is certainly competent, I found the whole thing really, really dull.Anyway, I'll put it aside for now and hopefully have the energy to come back to it another time. After reading so many positive reviews, I really feel like I'm missing something."
2,Didn't care about the characters,"I found this a very hard book to get through. The writer didn't make me care about the story and the characters. The scenes were well described, but I just couldn't picture most of them in my head. Some scenes were obviously better than others, but overall just a two star book."
1,why do the characters not come to life?,"I gave up after 200 pages. Maybe it is the Dutch translation, but I had the strong feeling it is also the writer who is just not able to even bring his hero Stephen to life. I gave up after 200 pages and that does not happen very often........."
5,Great WWI story,"If you are intrigued with World War I stories, I believe you might just like this one. It is love story and a story about the soldiers working in the tunnels."
4,If you enjoyed it...,"Reading ""Birdsong"" got me hooked on WWI, a subject I knew very little about. WWII is much more accessible. So, I found "" A Very Long Engagement"" by Sebastien Japrisot, a French prize-winner, translated into English, and was drawn back to WWI France, and another moving story of love and loss. A very intricate mystery as well, satisfying on many levels. Highly recommended."
2,No connection,"While the war descriptions are riveting and very moving, I saw little connection between the war (love) story and Elizabeth Benson. The sections from the 70's were unnecessary and did little to add to the story, which could have been told in the first person from Stephen alone. As with most disappointing novels, the story is tied together in the last few pages. I rate it a 2."
3,BLOODY romance,"The only redeeming quality of the book for me (born in the 60's) is the description of the war and how it was fought. I had no idea of the trenches, the underground fighting, the horror of silence. The readers didn't need Isabelle for Stephen or Elizabeth to repeat the history of her Grandmother. It was too tidy and completely unnecessary. Stephen would have found another compelling reason to fight. His spirit for continuing to fight like a machine was the only thing that kept me interested. This could have been a major work of art but turned into a mere sideshow."
5,What a page-turner!,The horror of WWI is shockingly and powerfully portrayed through a complex story line and characters you come to love through all their flawed humanity.
4,Birdsong,"A wonderful story of love and war. Hard to put down, deep and meaningful. A great writerReminds you how soul destroying wartime must have been."
2,boring,"If I'm not into a story by page 50.... Buy the DVD it was well done, but this never got my interest"
4,Outstanding prose; draws you in almost against your will.,"An almost sleepy start leads you through a clandestine love affair to the horrors of a war which should never have happened. The novel's power comes as much from the portrayal of human beings' ability to adjust to almost anything as from the description of the hell which makes it necessary.Those readers who criticize the sudden an unexpected 'jump' to the present day miss the point. By the time this comes we too have adjusted to the hell; the change of gear is a necessary device to wrench us away from that with which we have now almost become comfortable. Faulkes' rather too convenient, if slightly syrupy, creation of Elizabeth's pursuit of the truth can be forgiven for the way in which that truth is delivered.A must-read."
5,Triumph from the Trenches,"Mr. Faulks has captured the essence of war in what is perhaps the best novel ever written about The Great War. We are taken into the horror of the trenches while at the same time we delve into the hearts and minds of the heros whose only goal is to live one more day. A triumph of love and perseverance in the darkest of times. If you like this book, watch forNight of Flames: A Novel of World War IIby Douglas W Jacobson coming in October 2007."
2,What's all the hype about?,"As a lover of historical fiction, particularly with a war-based background and with several ""The greatest book I've ever read"" and ""Have re-read several times"" comments from Amazon's learned reviewers, I couldn't wait to read this book. However, reviews are nothing but opinion and I ended up being disappointed........Why? Well, I guess I just found Faulk's writing to be quite labourious and his characters bland and uninspiring to me as the reader.The initial part set before the war was a bit cliched and predictable - ""young handsome Englishman wins over repressed older French woman, but relationship is ultimately doomed"" - very Mills and Boon type of stuff. Then we cut to the war with the mud and blood, senseless loss of lives, poor leadership, etc etc etc. Seen it all before I'm afraid - ""tell me something new"" I kept thinking as I ploughed on. The ""contemporary"" parts with the grand-daughter didn't really grab me either.All in all, an average read."
5,Superb,"Every word is a pleasure, the novel is a tour de force. Sensual, erotic and deeply moving. His prose is a delight to read and the love stories are first rate. He is a flawed hero, one we can identify with. His women are also fascinating characters making heroic sacrifices. The book is one you will never forget. A huge novel, but you will want to read it twice in one sitting! A testimony to love, and the so-called lost generation."
1,Thank you fellow one star reviewers!,"Thanks so much to the people who have given this book one or two stars and who lived to tell the tale!! I feel as though I've been in the trenches.....until my rude awakening in 1978????!!!! last night. I was so ready to give up on this book and it is those of you courageous enough to buck the establishment who give me the courage to do so. I have no fear of birds. I am not afraid of Germans. In fact, at my age, I don't even really fear death. Bad writing and the thought of spending the day sweating in formal clothes near a fetid river scare me. When I read the jacket of this book I was prepared to be blown away by the awesomeness that was this book. I kept waiting right up until the time I read these one and two star reviews and I could not agree with all of you more. We will push on in search of a good read!"
4,We can never fully empathise,When reading Birdsong I was attracted by the characters' struggles but at once repelled by the vivid description. I read on with sympathy and pity but at the same time never fully appreciating or understanding the horror. The calmness of many of the soldiers warmed my heart whilst causing me to recoil at their apparent composure in the face of such suffering. A feeling I do not understand. Only those who have endured such affliction may comment fully on this novel and the power of the imagery and emotions conveyed.
4,a poignant story of love in war,"Rarely have I read a more frightening description of the terrible conditions of war in the trenches; and the beautiful counterpoint of escape to the love story of Stephen and Isabelle. The book influenced me to read more of the trench warfare of the First World War and the madness that left millions dead for such precious little gain. A magnificent book, weakened only by Elizabeth's modern day quest which seemed trvial in comparison to the power of the core story."
2,Hackneyed,"This was such a disappointing read after all the hype. I'm giving up halfway through, and passing my copy to someone who may appreciate it more. The first part of the book was so hackneyed that I found it laughable - I was not at all convinced by the love story. I got very annoyed by Faulk's omniscient narration, the viewpoint constantly flitting from person to person. As other reviewers here have pointed out, Faulks has a tendency to ""tell rather than show"", which deprives the reader of much of the pleasure of reading. I also found that I couldn't care less about the characters, particularly Steven, who remains vague and shadowy. That I stuck with the book so long is testimony to the fact that Faulks recreates the scenes in the trenches so well. Both my grandfathers fought in WW1 and I am so hungry to know more about what they experienced. But maybe I'd be beter off reading a good history book."
2,Mediocre to Poor,"This CD lacks any punch. Byron Lee & the Dragonaires have the sound of a cocktail lounge house band. Tolorable but not anthing to go out of your way for. This particular Byron Lee aulbum actually includes the the ""& Friends"" in the title which combined with ""Ska-Rock Steady"" induced me to give it them another try. In this case ""Friends"" were often worse then Byron Lee. For example the first track ""My Boy Lillypop"" features Spencer, Roberts and is ""screetchy."" IT set my nerves on edge. If you want Ska buy Ska, if you want Raggae buy Ska but don't bother with this."
5,"An aural feast that is by turns melodic, rowdy, & poignant.","Shaun Davey has assembled a magnificent group of artists for this extraordinary soundtrack. I'm eagerly awaiting the movie's arrival at a cinema near me, meanwhile, I bought the CD because I know Davey's work. He does not disappoint here. From the rousing opening track to the Waterboys' rugged ""Fisherman's Blues"", Rita Connolly's exquisite vocal work on ""Hear Me"" to the final ""Parting Glass"", Davey has used a myriad of talented Irish musicians and singers to weave a seamless, beautifully accessible soundtrack. ""Waking Ned Devine"" has quickly become a favorite in my Celtic music collection and Shaun Davey has a new creation that can stand proudly beside, ""The Relief of Derry Symphony"", ""Granuaile"", and ""The Brendan Voyage""."
5,beautiful music,"My wife and I recently saw the movie ""Waking Ned Devine"" due to our interest in Ireland. At the end of the movie the song ""The Parting Glass"" was the closing melody. I was totally taken by this song.I immediately bought the sound track and have virtually played nothing but this CD since. If you enjoy a variety of music, this is one of the best I've heard, ever. Buy this album, and you wont regret it."
4,Love the Waterboys!,Loved the movie and couldn't get the soundtrack out of my mind but to me the biggest joke of the whole movie was when the credits rolled and I found out that the whole thing was filmed in the Isle of Man and not in Ireland!!!!!!! Now where do you want to go on vacation?
5,waking ned Divine,Absolutely wonderful!!! Very funny and shows beautiful Ireland. Being Irish this is one of our favorite movies.
4,"""Waking Ned Devine"" Soundtrack","If you love Gaelic music, you'll pretty much love this CD. Definitely watch the film, if you haven't had the pleasure...it will make the soundtrack much more meaningful. Lots of lively Irish music, beautiful vocals. Slainte!"
5,The Parting Glass,"The first time I heard ""The Parting Glass"" was during the conclusion of a documentary about the last game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. This song played as Al Kaline, the Hall-of-Famer, took one last look around the empty stadium before heading down the tunnel for the last time. The tears flowed and I knew I had to find a copy of this song. I was, therefore, delighted when I watched ""Waking Ned Devine"" and this was the last song played in the movie. Since buying the CD I have played this one song over and over again. It alone is worth the price of the entire CD. Highly recommended."
4,A true beauty.,"This is a soundtract that does not betray any expectation. No duds in the lot, each song has a unique personality and is well delivered. Good voices, excellent instrumentation. The last song puts to words a lovely old poem (the author of which I don't know) called The Parting Glass - it alone would be worth buying the CD."
5,Great movie!,I have watching this movie at least 30 times. It's a nice change from violence and drama and reminds me of the times I spent in Ireland. Landscape is breathtaking and characters are very true to life.
3,ned devine,I was a little disappointed in the overall music on the CD. The theme fromthe movie was excellent but the restof the cd was so so.
4,One of the best looks at racial tension after 'Nam.,"The movie shows it age, but the whole movie does show the tension. You look at today and you see that it is all still there, but covered up better. White man who has a black buddy in 'Nam who gets killed. He goes to the ghetto to inform the father and runs into the brother's gang. Like I stated before, the movie shows its age, but i do think it helps the younger generation realize the way it was....and still is."
2,Didn't last long,"This was my second marble towel holder. Both of them broke where the stem connects to the base. (Our fault, we dropped it.) Currently using a stainless steel towel holder that we like a lot better."
2,Where's the rest of it??????,Why bother with a whole soundtrack if you are only going to put a handful of songs on it. The best tunes from the movie aren't even on the disc. An EP would have been sufficient for the Sting and Henly tracks. Not 4 songs and 21 tracks of dialogue.
4,Sting and Don Henly make this soundtrack worth it.,"For all of you that haven't seen the movie, four songs in this compilation make this disc a must. Sting sings three jazz tunes that are among his best of all time, Angel Eyes, My One And Only Love, and It's A Lonesome Old Town. Don Henley contributed a track as well called Come Rain Or Come Shine, which also has a jazzy feel to it. Never have I bought a twenty track CD simply for four of its songs, however, the Leaving Las Vegas Soundtrack is an exception."
5,"Music mimicks movie, if you're feeling low...","Remember the movie, how Ben's life started bad and just got worse and worse. This soundtrack makes you feel all those feelings all over again. I find I put it on when I'm feeling down and has been an old friend to me. You literally can just put it on and let the whole CD play and not be worried about finding this track or that."
1,Butchering the classics,"If you enjoy listening to singers such as Sting and Don Henley destroy classic material this is the album for you. I have no idea why the director chose this material, and these singers, but they do not mix. This is especially true of Sting, who destroys My One and Only Love with his high whiney voice. I recommend the John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album. Once you know what the song is supposed to sound like you will know what I mean."
3,Leaving Las Vegas Soundtrack,"The music is fabulous, but unfortunately distracted by the annoying narratives between songs."
1,Left off of Las Vegas,"Very disappointed, the only song that I wanted ""You Turn me On"" wasn't on the CD. Went back and looked and it was listed as one of the songs with a disclaimer. why even list it as a track, if its not on the disk???"
4,It was everything i expected,"I was searching for this item on the web and this is not an easy video to find so i was very happy when it got home, at least it got home here in Mexico and it was in a good state."
2,Didn't enjoy,"No real story, mostly jockey's bios. Nothing like the Jerry Bailey book I recentl readHere are the five more words you need."
2,too tight,I'm sure they work IF you can get them on. I could hardly get them on my toes so didn't go any further. They are SO tight with very little give.
1,"Product was not ""In Stock"" at all","Contrary to what the post stated, the product was not in stock.We ordered it Dec 23 and I had to cancel my order Jan 12, two weeks later. I was not sent an email in the meantime explaining this. I had to contact them and ask where my products were!They got back to me quickly via email when I asked where the package was.Unfortunately, the product was still not in stock and I never received the product I wanted. Had to go elsewhere."
5,This is an inspirational book about life and selfworth,I have had this book for many years and still enjoy looking through these pages filled with rules of life and behavior. I dont know if it is possible for us to follow these teachings to the fullest but it is always useful to have a guide. When people want to relax and think about thier life and what they should do to make it better. Just looking out the window might not be the answer. This book is worth reading to give direction and stimulate thought. It pin-points ideas which should be given serious thought and hopefully saved in our minds to be called upon when needed to develop our being. I hope you get a lot out of this book. I know you will be a better person for just having read this book.
2,Avoid the Kindle edition of the Great Bridge,McCullogh's The Great Bridge is greatly diminished in the Kindle edition by the absence of bridge construction diagrams and pictures that are included in print editions. A good read could have been even better if the pictures and diagrams were included in the Kindle.
4,All You Wanted to Know and Then Some,This book is fantastic. Now I know everything about the building of the Brooklyn Bridge. The author goes into tremendous detail about the building of the great towers of the bridge and how the wires were strung across the East River. The building of the Brooklyn Bridge was truly an astounding accomplishment for its day and to think that the bridge still stands is a testament to the tremendous efforts of the men who made it happen. The Great Bridge makes the story come alive.
5,So enjoyed this read!,Was a wonderful read. I was so curious about the history of the Brooklyn Bridge. So glad I read it & would highly recommend it. I even went to NYC to walk over the Brooklyn Bridge to Brooklyn and then back. Wow! Another thing checked off my bucket list!!!!
4,The Great Bridge,"I'm a big McCullough fan, all his history books read like novels. 1776 was the most enjoyable book I have ever read, fiction or non fiction. I would have given ""The Great Bridge"" five stars if it had left out a little of the minutia of the day to day activities. The incredible details of everyday life made me feel as if it could have been from personal memories rather than reading. For McCullough fans its a must read."
1,Great Kindle Sample - but a Snoozer,"I downloaded a sample of this book to my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed the sample. Then I downloaded the entire book and sadly the book soon became a chore to read. I am from the Cincinnati area and enjoyed reading the background of the Cincinnati Roebling bridge, but could not make it through the book. The book is written in the passive voice, additionally the Kindle version has no diagrams to keep the reader's interest. zzzzzzzzz. My advice, read the free sample, save your $14.99 and move on."
1,The Great Bridge: The Epic Story of Building the Brooklyn Bridge by David McCulloulgh,I just received my book today. There is ink on the outside of the pages. I paid for a book in brand new condition. This is the first time I paid for a book and am dissatisfied. Since I am a senior it would be too hard for me to return it. Please let people know that this person (or company) is not good. If this happens again I will not order books from you.
4,All as described!,I was pleased to receive this book - should be interesting reading by a great author. The book is definitely older but other than a bit 'yellow' it is in very nice shape.
5,"Great History of The Bridge, New York, Brooklyn and America","I received this book as a gift, and it turned out to be one of the greatest books I've read in a long time. The descriptions of the era and the people involved are fantastic and truly attach you to the bridge and it's Chief Engineer, Washington Roebling. The author also had a knack for making even the most complex aspects of engineering interesting.If you enjoy reading history, or the history of NYC or Brooklyn, you will really enjoy this book. The only book that I have read that can compare to ""The Great Bridge"" is Luc Sante's ""Low-Life"" for information and entertainment value. I was actually bummed when I was finished with it."
5,Outstanding!,"A stunning account of one of the greatest engineering accomplishments this world has ever seen. A thoroughly enjoyable read, from start to finish."
4,Very Interesting but long-winded at times,Very interesting book especially if you live in New York or Brooklyn. Being able to walk the Brooklyn Bridge after reading this was an amazing experience. It can get boring and long-winded at times but overall if your into American history then this is definitely a book you would enjoy
5,So Much History,"Granted, I am a McCullough devotee. I read whatever he writes but enjoy his work to different degress I must admit. This is at the top of my list. The implication of the Brooklyn Bridge is felt on so many different stages and the author graphically brings the curtain up on all of them. Beginning with the suspension bridge over the Ohio River in Cincinnati to the Golden Gate, the Brooklyn Bridge is part of an amazing array of stories. Roebling and Straus ...the two least known American heroes in history. Both strange and quirky. Who could guess that the story of an American landmark could contain so much texture. And I love that McCullough gives Emily Roebling such credit. Read the book, walk the span and I predict it will remain deep in your psyche."
5,You'll have to make a pilgrimage when you close the book!,"David McCullough is a guarantee, and the Brooklyn Bridge is too. But did you know that the Roeblings are top grade, 100%, acme dudes as well? This is a fine story that would be nearly unbelievable as fiction, but which is as interesting as anything a person could make up, better for being true. I just loved the book!"
3,Brooklyn Bridge,"the subject was fascinating, the narrative great but a little ponderous. I had a little bit of a hard time staying with the excess of detail."
5,The Great Bridge,I have just started reading this book. So far I find it very interesting. I am sure I will enjoy this book.
5,It's David McCullough,It's David McCullough. Has he ever written anything that wasn't good. The PBS version of this is a really good watch.
2,okay,"Just okay. Its about the bridge...a little long in places, kind of boring, its history...what else can I say. okay."
1,Can you even think !,A very slow day if Mr. Mc Cullough has to write anything that has to do with one of the smelliest bridges and cities in the United States.
4,Detailed,"I recently read this work via Books on Tape, in a 1990 recording by Grover Gardner. (17 CDs) I felt that he did a fine job of reading this text. At first glance I thought the book would be one about engineering, etc. While this work does include some of these data, the book is largely about the people and times surrounding the construction of this ""8th"" wonder of the world. McCullough does wonderfully to bring into focus the various problems which faced those 19th century personalities involved in this project. Good reading for anyone liking more insights into this interesting area of American history."
5,One of the Greatest Books I have ever read,"This book is such a compelling read that it became an obsession. No historical writer I know can explain complicated technical subjects like McCullough. It's a history of Brooklyn, technology and America in a special time and place and unforgettable"
4,An amazing engineering marvel that stands to this day,"David McCullough has done it again. Along with The Path Between the Seas, this is one of his best works. The book comes alive with a truly marvelous story about early engineering and (mostly) failed bridges and how one man, John Roebling, and his legacy did it right. A spectacular feat that will make you appreciate bridges and their builders. It is amazing to read how it was done especially considering the tools of the time. My next trip to New York will undoubtedly include a trip to the Brooklyn Bridge."
5,A Wonder of the World,Growing up in Brooklyn I fell in love with the Brooklyn Bridge. I courted my future wife walking over that bridge several times in my 20s. This book has captured the whole essence of what the bridge meant to NY and Brooklyn. The background of the politics and the people who made it happen are described and fully captured in the book. Lots of info of just what materials and how much were used in the bridge and how the many problems and unknowns were addressed made for fascinating reading. McCullough has done his wonderful thing with this book.
4,Historical bridge,"McCullough delivers again - exhaustive research brings details to the story of the Brooklyn Bridge and all the behind the scenes drama that took place in the construction of the ""eighth wonder of the world"". Roebling Jr. as the Chief Engineer after his father's death and the involvement of his wife, Emily, throughout the years of construction along with all the politics of the age and the two cities involved make for great reading."
5,Fantastic Bridge,At first I thought this book would be boring. It was awe inspiring to find out how in that day and age they could build such a fantastic bridge that still stands today
4,Always loved this movie,"Came quickly, very happy with my new movie! Loved this movie since I was a kid, one of my favorite fantasy movies"
3,Review,Like the legend of Sinbad. He the fact he is a great pirate and in the real story is very much a pirate in the fact that he is only concerned about himself. The blending of Greek mythology into the storyline is great.
3,I was enjoying it at one point...,"...and I started to get the urge to buy it soon after, but the ending is the WORST! After Sinbad and Marina left, I was expecting something cool like an epic rescue fight like in Lilo and Stitch(1 AND 2!!!), or a race against time to save the planet like in Treasure Planet. Also I don't think that Sinbad and Marina struck up a good relationship, and the film is incredibly slow. On the good side, the film is very similar to Disney's Treasure Planet, and this gets three stars because it's far better, which is all I really wated to see this for anyway."
2,poor,Even though the tape only cost $1.00. Reading up on the description from the buyer who claim it was is new condition. I found this comment not to be true at all. The tape is truely only worth a $1.00. The movie is VERY BLARE. The only reason I have not send it back is because it is not worth the returned fee.
5,Nicely Done!,Went to see the film with my 6 and 8 year olds. I know that we all enjoyed the action filled scenes. It also offers a good lesson in friendship and keeping your word. Good use of humor throughout. Some suspensful scenes that lead nicely to a conclusion. I would highly recommend this movie all ages.
4,Definitely summer fun,I was pleasantly surprised how fun it was. Non-stop action scenes and some very neat visual effects. It was a breath of fresh air compared to all the predictable shoot em up martial arts kickboxing movies out right now.
5,Outta Sight!,"This is not only one of the best recent animated films I've seen, but is actually an epic piece of cinema. The visuals are stunning, spectacular, highly imaginative, whatever adjectives one can drum up!It's the singlemost imaginative creative endeavor onscreen that I've seen in the past five years. If you're a fan of THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN or TIME BANDITS, you're going to love this movie. It's in the same spirit, but also employs all the state of the art CGI effects and pixel animation innovations that have brought new standards to the industry.The story is actually involving, and the voice overs are masterfully done. The animation is full '60s Trip level. Do yourself and your family a favor and make this one a part of your permanent collection! This is truly artful animation of the highest order.BEK"
3,Well-cast crud,"""Sinbad-Legend of the Seven Seas"" is a well cast and performed forgettable fantasy. While Brad Pitt, Michelle Pfieffer, Dennis Haysbert, and Catherine Zeta-Jones loan excellent talent to the movie, there's little for them to work with. Ultimately, it's a waste of talent of actors who seem natural for the roles.Brad Pitt shines behind the microphone as Sinbad, the charming rogue, and Michelle Pfieffer also glows black as the evil Eris, goddess of discord. (Her hair is practically a character itself.)But, the story is formulaic and predictable, and seems to be driven on just enough for the next high speed chase. And the animation seems to poorly mesh, and often seems to be stuck 10 years behind the current technology. (And is it my imagination, or does every single Dreamworks character seem the same?)All in all, it's not bad, but there's a lot better out there."
5,Nice movie!,"My kids (young boys) both loved this movie and watched it again and again. I watched quite a few times myself, with them :-) Very entertaining!"
5,Sinbad and the Legend of the Seven Seas!,"Sinbad:Legend of the Seven Seas is a good movie! If you like Dreamworks other movies like Road to El Darado,then want to add this collection,but just for the fun of it,its a good movie to watch. It features the voices of Brad Pitt,Catherine Zeta Jones,and bunch of other well knowed voice actors."
3,BETTER THAN YOU HEARD,"Though not a theatrical hit, SINBAD: LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SEAS (DreamWorks) is much more entertaining than I expected. Sinbad's quest to recover the Book of Peace from the edge of the world is an uneven mix of Arabian Nights elements, manga style characters, beautiful background art and the voices of Brad Pitt, Michelle Pfeiffer and Catherine Zeta-Jones."
1,TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN!,"Brad, Catherine, and Michelle, what a great cast. The story was even good but this animated movie from Dreamworks totally killed the story of Sinbad. The effects were horrible, and even though, the cast was good vocally the film just didn't out-do the other animated films of 2003 (ex. Brother Bear) If this movie had been live action and used the same cast, It could probably rival Pirates of the Caribbean, but as an animated film the movie totally disappoints in every aspect."
5,excellent fun,"What beautiful art, what gorgeous music! The siren scene alone is worth the price of this DVD. I put this in every once in a while just to relax and enjoy. If you are a fan of visual animation, don't miss this one."
4,"One of the better animation titles so far, this decade","I am somewhat of a fan of animation movies, and I just wanted to rate this movie as one of the top 10 that I have seen recently. Yes, the storyline is somewhat clichéd and the characters are clichéd, as well, but the animation and the thrill of the adventure more than make up for it. From one adversity to another, how will Sinbad overcome insurmountable odds? oh but he does- watching this unfurl on the screen is what is so great about this movie!"
4,Lovely Lumina,"Lumina has the palest skin I've ever seen on a Barbie with shimmer (I suppose reminscent of the moon). Her blueness seems to be a hit with little girls. The hair is straight and less likely to get messy. My 4 year old calls these dolls ""scary"" but she's much more interested in playing and looking at them than the traditional Barbie (of which she has only one). I think these dolls are just gorgeous with their larger face and fuller features, soft glitter and of course permanently painted on bodysuit."
4,My 4 year old loved this doll for the necklace...,"but the necklace broke the 2nd time she opened it. Now it will not close. My 8 year old loves the doll and plays with her all the time. Her wings can be pretty sharp, so watch out if you have little ones."
2,disappointed,"This CD was not what I expected, which was a reasonable facsimile of Bob Carlisle's performance. The ""club"" and ""extended club"" versions are laughable. To get a good copy of this song, spend the few extra dollars and buy the original CD, not the single!"
3,COLORFUL VIGNETTES ABOUT LIFE IN ISRAEL,"Oestermann does a nice job weaving the modern and ancient history of Jews in that country. His storytelling is particularly graceful in a chapter on the fate of the fortress of Gamla on the Golan Heights. Jewish warriors played a heroic role against the Romans at almost the same time as their Masada brethren did. Readers without much background about Israel will particularly enjoy Born Again.Friday, May 5, 2000 - The Jerusalem Post"
1,Ugh!,"I consider myself a big Kenton fan -- this band was far from his best, combined with a lousy recording (which often comes with the territory with a live bootleg) makes this a big disappointment. Trumpets are terribly recorded and the solos are very weak."
3,a new book for me,"sorry ,i havn't read the book,but i'm a doctor ,so everybookfor me is new,especialy it is a professional book."
5,Nimrod-Elgar where to find the exact music?,"I just bought the Elgar CD in the hopes of finding the music from the movie. I was disappointed, however, because this CD only contains an instrumental version, and I am fairly sure that in the movie there was a beautiful opera voice intermixed with this piece. Is this available on the soundtrack or was I hearing things?"
2,Elgar's. Nimrod~~~cut off abruptly!,"I can't believe the producers of this CD saw fit to lop off the ends of some of the most beautiful music ever, esp. Elgar's ""Nimrod"" with the soprano background. I have looked it seems forever to find a copy with the soprano singer(s). Does anyone know where I can find one??? I have several CDs with ""Nimrod"", all orchestral. I want the singer!! I'm SO disappointed."
5,Terrific Soundtrack,"Love the music - so epic and grand in some places and poignant in others. I listen to this a lot at work as background music. Great compositions and performances, befitting a queen!!"
5,So wonderful!!!!!!!,"I've seen the movie,""Elizabeth"" with the music.I can't explain the impression with words.That's fa- ntastic! The music makes the movie greater and gr- eater! And in the movie,you can hear a part of Mo- zart's ""Requiem"".If you get the CD(""Elizabeth"")be- fore you go to the movie,you must enjoy the movie more.I believe so.So if I were you,I would get the OST CD ""Elizabeth"".I wish you all enjoy the music from the motion picture ""Elizabeth""."
2,Musical score falls short,"I enjoyed the film ""Elizabeth"" very much. I thought the music in the film was excellent; particularly at the conclusion of the movie and credits. I found the DVD musical scores were cut short. I think they should have compiled the musical score that was on the conclusion of the film, to the DVD. All the musical numbers were compiled into one piece. This, at least, should have been added to the DVD. Play the movie and listen to the conclusion and credits, and you'll know what I mean."
2,Sadly missing,"I have read the reviews of this soundtrack and they tend to be quite high. I honestly have not seen this entire movie nor have I listened to the soundtrack. I have come across this in search of an incredible piece of music that someone has seen fit to delete from this soundtrack. Either that or has been uncredited. The piece is by Thomas Tallis. It's called Te Deum. It is played during the sequence of her coronation, I believe. I have had the honor to be a part of the performance of this piece and am very sorry to see it unincluded in this soundtrack. Tallis was one of the predominate choral masters of the time. If you can find it, you will be truly lucky! It is nine minutes plus of beauty in music!"
4,A good course supplement text.,A concise and useful analysis approach on the subject. It is intended for a junior or higher level college audience. I used this for more technical details while taking an engineering technology course on communications.
4,A Pretty Good Time Travel Novel,"I found this book to be a pretty good read. I don't think Harry Harrison is quite the master of alternative history that Harry Turtledove is but he is a good writer. Most of the book deals with the present and is a detective novel. The last third of the book takes place juste before and during the civil war. I thought the first half of the book was very well paced and written and if the entire book had maintained the same tempo it would have deserved 5 stars. I felt the last part of the book, although satisfactory, was a little rushed and trite.Definitely worth a read."
1,Very disappointing for Harrison,"Harrison usually has intelligent characters making reasonable decisions, but this book is premised on a decision that is so ridiculous, that I couldn't get past the first few chapters. The situation: A modern-day bad guy has taken the plans for a simple machine gun back in time to change the outcome of the Civial War. The obvious solution: Take a year to train a Seal Team for the mission (You can send anyone from anywhen to anywhen, so it doesn't matter how much time you take to prepare.) Send them back to a month before the bad guy arrived, so that they are ready and waiting for him when he gets there. Harrison's solution: Send a lone black man with no training and no weapons to pre-Civil War Virginia to arrive several months after the bad guy. That's silly."
2,Ink came coagulated like Jello,"Normally great stuff. Not sure what happened in this case. The ink won't stick to fabric; it clumps together and won't break apart. Tried stirring, but it won't return to its liquid form."
3,Very Poor shipping method,"I am only giving a 3 rating because of the incompetent way these tubes were shipped. I received these Tubes in the mail and was blown away at how they were shipped. I expected them to be in a box wraped in bubble wrap at least. They were in a cheap thin shipping bag with no packing material to protect the tubes. When I opened the bag both tube box's were smashed and one tube was rolling around loose. I am amazed they were not broken. I put them in my amp and they seem to work but for how long? As far as sound, I really like these Ruby EL34's and if not for the shipping issue I'm sure I would give them a good review. I put them in my Rivera Clubster 45 112 combo and it is a great improvement over the Electrohormonics EL34's that were in it."
2,I think I wasted my $$,"Not for people who want to shape their bodies! This is more of a performance dance dvd. Tanna is not a good instructor and production values are not very good, either. And why have an introduction by a fitness instructor if you made a dance dvd? I was disappointed in this workout because it is not even on each side of the body, the moves are vague, the instructor mumbles. I did like the mirror- this helped me see better how to perform the moves. I felt as if I should already know how to belly dance; perhaps that is the target audience? I will stick to Rania's workout dvd's with a belly dance 'flavour', at least I can work up a sweat. And what is all this palaver with the fabric and the cane? I thought they were optional, but they are central to the dance."
3,Bellydance for Body Shaping: Upper Body,"I found the cane dance on this DVD adorable! I can't get enough.From that alone, I feel like I got my moneys worth!"
3,"Great Collection, but poor quality","The collection of songs is great - it's perfect for me. I like Johnny Cash, but I'm not a die-hard fan with a need for his whole collection. The number of songs and the songs chosen are perfect, and I do like the way the discs are arranged by category. The only complaint I have, and it's a big one, is the quality. It sounded so bad I turned it off on my first listen. Very tinny with some popping and crackling. The bass is lost and when you tweak on the EQ, it distorts even worse. I have had cassettes with better quality. I think it sounds fine on a low quality CD player that does not have a lot of range in sound to begin with, but when played on something a little more high end with a lot of range like a 10 speaker Bose car stereo, the poor quality is really accentuated making it painful to listen to."
5,Johnny Cash - Still the greatest...ever!,"Even though I have nearly every album Johnny Cash ever recorded, I rate ""The Legend"" as a truly marvellous collection, really representative of the unique talent that was Johnny Cash. I was particularily impressed with the previously unreleased tracks, it was worth buying the collection for these alone. Johnny, you may be gone to the great Old Opry in the sky, but your memory is as strong as ever!Pat Cooney, Dublin, Ireland"
3,Missing some songs,"As with any ""box set"" I realize you can't have every song in ones' collection unless you buy the entire catalog, and with Cash that could be difficult. It would be nice to see some rarities like ""Devils right hand"" thrown into this box set to make it a little more complete..."
4,great collection,"This is a great collection! Johnny Cash, his best songs are here. Give My Love to Rose, and Cry Cry Cry are classics! This is a great gift idea for yourself or a friend. My only complaint is Cash's version of Hurt isn't on here, but, there are so man other classics on here that it doesn't even matter. It makes up for it. Cash, Walk the line, Chesney, Blue Chair, Gretchen Wilson, All Jacked Up, Corinna Fugate, Undertow, Rascal Flatts, Feels Like Today, and Johnny Cash, Live at Folsom Prison."
4,Cash box set,"I think that it is a great compilation. I would have enjoyed more of his later works, including some rare covers, but otherwise every recording was wonderful. This was a gift for my father & he thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Johnny Cash Fan,"I bought this for my husband, who is a big Johnny Cash fan. He loves it. It is a must for any JC fan, as it is a great collection of his most famous songs."
4,"Box Set ""Johnny Cash ...The Legend""",I am very well satisfied with the box set. It does help to fill in some obscure areas of his musical accomplishments. There also were several songs he recorded that I was not aware of. Sound quality was very good.
5,great buy!,its just what i wanted and expected from amazon. thank you for the fast shipping and wonderful product! great cd's and a great price
3,Verty good colection of Cash music.,The only reason that I did not give this outstanding compilation a 5 star rating is because it could not contain all of this legendary entertainers music. This is understandable however considering he recorded hundreds and hundreds of songs. This is a very good overall grouping. Very satisified.
5,Brings Back Memories,"While we are not serious listeners to Country Music, I purchased this set as a gift for my husband. We both grew up w/ our parents & grandparents listening to Johnny Cash and the like of that era. I don't think I EVER remember a Sunday family dinner at my relatives that I heard ""Ring of Fire"" or gospel tunes from ""The Man in Black"" any less than 2 times! Same for my husband, only his dad listened all week long to Johnny & Kris Kristofferson.CD collection is wonderful. Along with the old farmiliar songs we are hearing may tunes for the first time. Certainly brings back memories!"
4,The Best,This is by far the best collection of Johnny Cash songs ever put together. Buy it and enjoy it for many years to come as I have.
5,Excellent,"The Johnny Cash Album, The Legend, is of excellent quality and delivered on time. I am very satisfied with Amazon's service!"
3,I Witness,"As movies about the Mexican drug war go, this isn't a bad little movie, but for some reason, it just didn't grab me. It has some twists and its heart is in the right place (I think) but honestly I liked Oliver Stone's Savages better (and I don't think its heart was in the right place!) Go figure! If you like Jeff Daniels then check this video out. Spader has a fairly minor role and I do like that there is at least one HIspanic character who has a real role in the film (other than playing a sleazy gangster.)"
1,not,Not recommended. 15 minutes was more than enough. Thanks to fast forward. Too violent. Boring. Couldn't get into it. Not my type.
5,Livatone for life,"Unbelievably fast delivery. As for the product, it is excellent. I have a dysfunctional liver. I am not sure why my liver is such but it is. I don't eat that bad, although I do love sugar and my two cups of coffee per day, along with meat and veggies, fruit, protein drinks and cheese. I really noticed it when I started back on my natural hormone therapy and within 3 weeks was tired, bloated, belching and small nicks and cuts would not heal. My face broke also.I started this product up AGAIN. Earlier I convinced myself that after a few bottles of Livatone Plus all was well, and that I took care of the pesky liver problem. Ha, it was just waiting for the day! Now I understand that once my liver starts functioning properly, I must stay on maintenance and restrict my diet. I have looked around for other supplements but none are as thorough as this combination. If you have a liver like mine, don't kid yourself that you can get results with just a Milk Thistle/other herb combo."
3,Livatone plus,It is a good product but require long term maintenance. Does help but do not expect a cure. It is a bit expensive compared to milk thirsty available in any supermarket. Plus shipping cost of $6.00 for one little plastic bottle of the product
5,buy this book!,"I am lucky enough to have Bill Doyle as one of the three senators that represents me in Montpelier.Anyone looking for an intro to the fascinating and unique topic of Vermont's political history MUST read this book - it is excellent. Of particular interest is the tale of Matthew Lyon, a 19th century US Representative who was reelected while serving time in a Vergennes, VT prison (other quirky tales abound).The one and only criticism about this book is that at times Doyle leaves out critical analysis, such as the election of Consuelo Bailey as Lieutenant Governor in the 1950's - the first woman in the nation elected in her own right. The reasons behind this win were not discussed.In all, this book is informative and interesting - you will not be disappointed!"
5,An excellent look at the rich political history of Vermont.,"With over thirty years in the Vermont State Senate Senator Doyle can be looked upon as the foremost political historian in the state. He gives great narrative from the days of Ethan Allen, right up to the Democratic awakening of modern age. This is a must read for anyone interested in State politics. It is also a great way for Vermonters who have ventured elsewhere to connect with the history of this great state."
3,If you're looking for formulas,"then this book is for you. If you are designing your own indicators and are using Omega Tradestation then you will enjoy this book. I do create trading systems but don't use Tradestation so converting the formulas over would be too time consuming. There are LOTS of formulas too, all in Tradestation's language.His ideas are very good and could probably make me some money but due to the limited time I have to work on my TA, I had to return this book. If you use Tradestation, or have the time to adapt the formulas to your system, then you'll like this book."
2,author doesn't understand the theory of linear filters,"The author doesn't seam to know the theory of linear shift-invariant systems. Its very easy to see that his proposed double smoothing is just a convolutions of two EMA filters, and is approximated by a longer EMA, thus has the same lag."
2,Not impressed,"I thought this book was very short to begin with (only 104 pages of actual text, plus some small apendixes)...hardly worth $42 for a small amount of text. It's also very old (written in 1995). The content which is in the book is very difficult to apply because you really need a research tool (like tradestation) to apply these ideas. Numerous ideas in earlier chapters are brought back in later chapters and you have to go back and re-read to see what each indicator meant. I think all in all he just applies his idea of double smoothing to filter out misleading chart data....nothing revolutionary, and hardly worth the price.Also, as odd as this may seem, with all the math involved, 90% of the charts which he derives from these mathematical formulas look exactly like a line chart of the security!If you have access to tradestation, this book is worthwhile if you put the time into understanding all the concepts involved."
2,Use the Internet,"Have a new house and wanted to spruce up the lawn. We were told so many different tips that this book seemed like it would set us straight. Well, the first chunk of the book covers the anatomy of grass. I suppose it's useful to know, but was very detailed. The author even goes into detail on distinguishing grasses from one another, but admits you'd need to sit in your yard with a magnifying glass.Someone told us to use lime to raise the PH and spur growth. There is NO MENTION of lime in this book at all. My advice: Surf the Web. There are many helpful sites that cover the topic of lawn care. Save your money."
5,Superb smoky imaging,"Imagine yourself in a small, dimly-lit, nightclub in Buenos Aires with Silvana Deluigi leaning into the microphone, singing these astonishingly slow and sensual ballads, backed up by a small tango group that includes a cello. These are not all tango riffs, but not to worry. You'll be playing this CD over and over again - late at night, on rainy days, a glass of good wine, overwhelmed by the voice and the music. Call this, ""Argentina blues."""
1,instrumental,"This is basically an instrumental tango cd.The sound engineer must have been on vacation. The volume level is low and requires me to set the volume much higher for this cd than for the other cds, and when Silvana actually sings ,her voice is often drowned by the instrumentsI bought this before Amazon had offered previews. My error.I like Silvana's voice, unfortunately."
1,Deception Rides A Horse,"Okay, ""Death Rides A Horse"" ranks as one of the top ten Spaghetti westerns and Lee Van Cleef's best starring role in a Spaghetti western. However, DO NOT BUY this disc. First, it is not 16 X 9. Second, it is not widescreen. Instead, it is full-frame with a menu that allows you to play the movie. I know what I am speaking about because I ordered this awful piece of crap and thought that I would be getting some deluxe off-brand name widescreen version. That is NOT the case. In short, the wording on this movie is deceptive, highly deceptive. Beware!!! Happily, Amazon.Com allowed me to return this execrable junk. The company that manufactured this disc has no ethics. You can find a better bootleg version of this four-star western beautiful widescreen if you search the web."
2,Revenge is a dish best served italian style,"Here's another classic Italian made spaghetti western full of revenge and regret. 2 men competing to take out the same gang for different reasons. Beautifully shot with a memorable score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. In fact some of the score wound up being used the new film from Quentin Tarantino ""Inglorious Basterds"". I just wish that this film could get the DVD release it truly deserves. As the film has lapsed into public domain there are no remastered widescreen prints available. If someone online says they've got a widescreen copy they'd be lying. The supposed widescreen copy I purchased was a transfer of a full screen VHS print with very poor picture and video quality. But that still doesn't take away from how friggin' awesome this flick is!"
4,A good mix,This is a good mix of the hit single One Headlight. If you like the Electronic/Dance Genre and you like this song you will enjoy this CD.
2,Flimsy,"Kind of flimsy. I added an extra row of cedar 1x2's below it and gave it a covering of wood preservative. Works well now, but for all the effort I could have build my own from scratch."
5,Twelve Steps,Twelve StepsThis was an excellent choice and I would recommend it to friends who are interested in this subject.
4,12 Step Guide,"Personal Taste for this reader.....I'm sure if you are looking to purchase something on these lines, it can me helpful."
2,A Woman's Way Through the Twelve Steps.,I didn't like it because I couldn't understand much what was written in it. It didn't go along with the Big Book at all. It was way over my head.
1,not for me,"There must be something wrong with me, because I hate this book! I have been sober for ""quite some time"" and I do not agree with the premise that because I am a woman I need to work or read the twelve steps differently. I do not agree with the statement that the Big Book was written by men (was written by bill.w) for MALE alcoholics (it was written at a time when women were apart of a.a....see the forward to the first edition). This perspective is not one that I agree with and I would not waste my money or time on this book."
2,Not AA Approved,"This workbook softens the intended ""workout"" which guides recovering alcoholics in the sobering process meaning: learning how to grow up and deal with life using sober thinking rather than the emotionally extremes of the alcoholic's, immature, narcissistic view. However, if non-addictive people wants to go through it looking for a pleasing self exam it might be an enjoyable exercise."
5,Excellent Tool for any woman in recovery,"I have used this book personally and professionally for recovery issues. I can't reccommend it highly enough. If you or someone you care about is in early recovery or even if you are in recovery a long time and could use a refresher, this book is phenomenal. It is written simply, with no ""jargon"" and is very helpful in guiding you to focus on what you need to in order to live a purposeful and peaceful life in recovery, step by step. Progress not perfection. I give it to all my female counseling clients."
1,Not Ready Yet,"This book is for alcoholic women who have not surrendered to the God of their understanding. The book holds out that women are ""terminally unique"" and can't really be helped by the big book of AA which was created by all men. The bottom line is that women are not terminally unique and the big book of AA is the only way to get sober. So, don't order this book, get the big book!"
1,Bosch Universal Cookie Paddles,"Save your money. What works best for me is the instructions in the Universal handbook, ie, use the wire wisks to cream the butter-sugar. Remove the wisks, insert the dough hook and mix in the flour and other stuff. Much quicker, better mix, easier clean-up. Up date 3-10: Have found that if I mix the eggs first, then add the sugar mix, it doesnt pile up around the center. Latest batch of choc.chip cookies had great results with this paddle kit. Go ahead and buy this set."
3,Did not fit my model number like it stated it would,"I do not understand why, in this day of Tech, we can not get these things correct.They Were Quick and Competent with my return $$. I am Happy with that"
5,Another great Kotex Product,"I'm glad Amazon has started carrying these products even though they aren't cheap. Their prices aren't comparable to stores like Wal-mart, but the convenience of ordering products and having them shipped is just one thing I don't have to worry about when I'm rushing through a store.The Kotex Pantyliner with extra coverage is perfect it gives great panty coverage and the adhesive holds it in place very well so there is minimal risk of it moving. They are so thin and absorbant so for spotting or use with a tampon they are perfect to protect your underwear.Another high quality product by Kotex!"
3,nice to chew but not to swing...,"My Amazon loved to chew the wood off but wouldnt step onto it to swing. This is because once the wooden blocks and balls are gone, the swing perch shifts as the rope thats holding it is not fixed to the wire in a way that holds it in the centre. The wood holds it in place, but once its gone the whole swing perch slides from left to right, just where the weight is."
2,Spoon splits,The spoon splits at the scooping end after about 2 months of heavy use. It is very easy to use but the quality is low for commercial use.
5,Fantastic wooden spoon,We love these spoons- they wash up well and don't give splinters or get stained by red sauces. Great product!
1,The Oathkeeper,"THis necklace LOOKS like a great buy, thats because you cant see it up close. Basicly the metal its made out of is so weak, if you wear it around at all, your pretty much guranteed to break it. With all the shipping and charges, this item is way overpriced. The one I ordered broke as soon as I took it out of the box, and it took almost three weeks to get to my house. The box is made cheeply too. Not much good to say about this item, I think it was made in Mexico. Save yourself some time and money. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,broken in just a couple of days,"This necklace was clearly not meant for wearing, though nowhere on the box does is say so. My teenage daughter wore it for just two days before the blade actually broke off. I don't recommend buying it if you want to actually wear it. It's just not made for it."
1,BE CAUTIOUS,"This is an extremely beautiful necklace, but mine came through UPS broken. I am not really for sure if it was originally broken at the store or if it broke through the shipping. I'm kind of sad."
3,Interesting concept but... low resolution and bulky is a problem,"I recently purchased this left handed aerO2bic mouse for my wife, who is left handed. Although the design is interesting and does provide great support for the wrist there are a couple of significant flaws. One is that the mouse is large and bulky which makes it hard to maneuver in a tight space. Second, the resolution of the mouse is quite poor which means that you have to move the mouse a lot to get it across a screen (or 4 screens in my case!)... even with the pointer speed cranked up as high as it would go, I found I had to keep picking this bulky mouse up and moving it over. The combination is unfortunately poor.If you really need the wrist support and you only have one screen of moderate size then this can probably be a very good solution for you. In any case, be sure that you have a large mouse pad and a goodly amount of space to maneuver!!"
5,Bhava Yoga,"As mentioned in another review, almost anything by Russill Paul is great music for the practice of yoga, especially kundalini yoga. This album is GREAT! Russill Paul's life experience as a Benedictine monk in India and his exploration of Vedic music means this isn't some new age heavenly harps thing. This is THE stuff of the Vedas and it moves inside your psyche, gently pulling out the tension and the tugs of resistance. Very, very good stuff."
4,Ah the Memories,"Stole it from a friend, then a year later he stole it back. Fair play and all that. Finally bought the album on CD and it is part of my travelling 24. For all instances? No, but when I need something like Skatenigs, why not play the original? Still remember the first time I heard the CD, climbing the three flights of stairs to math class. Only other experience comparable was first hearing the first song on Clutch: Transnational Speedway League, also on the stairs leading up to math class. Anyway, just ordered What a Mangled Web We Leave and would definately recomend this to anyone who wants to be aurally kicked upside the head."
1,Crap,"I bought this piece of crap for somebody else. He seems to like it,but if this title was forced on his parents he would not be here!"
5,Worth the trouble,"This album has been very hard for me to find, and had been lifted from me more than once. I can't be mad though because this is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. It reminds me that there are still great bands out there that are in it for the fun and are great at what they do!! Anyone lucky enough to get ahold of this record should hold on to it. I am ordering it for the third time and can't wait to hear it!"
4,a good steal.,"I must admit that i stole this album of a friend a few years ago,but i'm glad i did. It has a good crisp sound to all the instruments and some really good distortion on the guitar parts,and what sounds like a drum machine which work really quite well with this type of muzic.over all an exellent album and a compleatly original sound makes this a gooden!If you cant steal it buy it!"
2,Very quiet... not worth the money,Was very disappointed. I had older unpowered Sony speakers that broke and these are no where near as good. The only thing good about them is the small size.
2,Hinge on this speaker too fragile!,"I purchased this to use in my bathroom. I dropped it once, and the hinge broke. The speaker itself does work, but it is frustrating to try and keep it propted up. I would recommend something less fragile."
3,Perfect for Low Volume Use in Cubicle,Since I work in a Dilbert cubicle - I was looking for a way to listen to my mp3 without earbuds - and not disturb my neighbors. This Sony speaker operates with no batteries required and plays at a low volume. Granted the sound is pretty tinny - but what do you expect for $20? Nice compact design - but don't expect Bose quality bass.
2,Fragile Hinge,"Broke after a few weeks of regular use, the stand/cover is now gone. It took a 16 inch (yeah, I actually measured, I know) fall and the hinge connecting it broke in half.Nice sound, decent design, but fragile. There's surprisingly few options in this space, but I think you can find something better."
4,Great sound for such small speakers,"Very pleasantly surprised with the size, sound quality, and design of this item; ordered another for a gift."
4,Works for me,My main reason for buying this was to have a way to listen to my mp3 player when I'm traveling and want to listen to it at bedtime but don't want the earbuds on. I also like being able to share a song with someone without giving my earbuds to them. The sound quality is not superb but is fine with adjustments to my mp3 equalizer. I'm glad I bought it. I works for my incidental needs.
2,looks cool but...,A great idea but the quality is not great. Since there is not battery to boost sound it is pretty quiet.
1,It worked for a spell then died,"There were a number of problems with this item. For one, it only worked with batteries which I had to replace fairly often. Secondly, I could not get a lot of sound out of it. When a friend and I tried to listen to music, we couldn't get it loud enough. After a while, the on and off switch was getting more difficult. I had to keep pressing it to turn on and off. Finally, I came into the room one day and the thing was making a death-rattle type noise. I hadn't turned it on, it just was dying right in front of me. I would not recommend this item. All in all it only lasted for several months with moderate use."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I picked this up for a little speaker set to carry around. I also have the Sony SRS-T33Sony SRS-T33 Compact Portable Speakers (Blue)active/passive speakers which work great. While this speaker is better passive than the SRS-T33 used passively, the TR-33 does have a better sound when battery powered. Nice to have in the kitchen or downstairs to plug my MP-3 player into while folding laundry.Let's not kid ourselves though, it's not gonna power a dance party.Also consider: the LG MSP-100LG OEM MSP100 MSP-100 Stereo Portable Universal Speakerwhich charges through USB and comes with connections for mini- and micro- jacks which also has a pretty nice sound for the size."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband to use on his desk at work and we are both disappointed with the sound quality. We were not expecting much because of the price but thought it would be a little better than this....the speaker phone on his desk sounds better. It is much smaller than expected also (should have read the fine print) but you live you learn. It now resides in a drawer in the office with the rest of our ""dead"" electronics/cords/extras."
1,Terrible,"I bought these speakers to use with a portable DVD player, I sent them back they have terrible sound quality."
1,Too Fragile for Travel,"The hinge on these speakers where they fold up is extremely fragile. They got knocked over once on the table and the hinge snapped, rendering the stand useless. In the hotel room, I had to rig up a deal with a washcloth and the Hotel Guidebook so I could prop up the now lame speakers. Who knew you had to be MacGuyver to use these things?Because they're inexpensive and small, I could deal with the very low volume (they are unpowered) and the extremely tinny sound - that was expected. However, add to it their tendency to break if you look at them sideways, and you are better off selecting something else."
2,great concept but sound is not loud enough,The internal speakers in my dvd player and my laptop produce louder sound than this. (Sound got indeed smaller when I plugged this guy in!) I just returned it.
3,Kids love this ball but...,"The handle doesn't last that long. Purchased it for Christmas. The very top portion (which is not double like the sides of the handle) breaks very easily. I have been taping it to keep it together but tape doesn't stay too long and handle has been breaking in different parts!If you are looking for a ball that will last a long time you may want to buy the ones with a handle that looks completely tubular. We have one of those too and it has not given us any trouble.Other than that, I have to say hop balls are a great buy. My kids bounce all around the house to go from room to room so it's a great way to exercise during those long rainy days!"
1,Lasted only 40 days,"My 3 kids (3,5 and 8 year old) really enjoyed this ball while it lasted. We only used it indoors and didn't hop on any glass or other sharp objects however one day it we noticed it was very deflated. This was about 40 days after we received it. It did get a lot of use while we had it, especially by my 45lb 5 year old. I thought it would last longer."
4,Great tool for balancing skills,My 3 year old loves this ball. Great for him to work on his balancing and coordination skills.Much better material thru what we had as kids. Very durable plastic material that has held up to indoor and outdoor usage. Worth paying the little extra for the fact this will not easily bust.
5,Great Fun!,"Got this for my 3.5 yr old for Christmas. First bounce was unsteady, but by the end of the day she was bouncing around the house like a pro. A week later and its still a favorite and much-used toy. Even great for use outdoors. Seems well made and that it will hold up to continued use. Was easy to inflate with bicycle tire pump."
2,not a cheese bible,"This book is OK for Yuppie wannabes who wish to impress their peers but not for those of us with refined taste for cheese who enjoy cheese for cheese's sake.I purchased the book expecting recipes on how to make various cheeses. Instead I got a Limited wikipedia on cheeses. Perhaps i should've read the advertising more carefully.Very disappointed in the book, not because of its content but because of the expectations i had about what i was buying. I seriously considered returning it but thought better of it and morally felt obligated to pay for my mistake, but if i were authorized by Amazon to return it I would without hesitation."
5,Great,"This product arrived in a very timely manner, giving me time to read it before my classes started! Thank you so much!! :)"
2,Damage,"The artist and sons are fine , the packageing was so poor that case is broken and a few scratches on the cd itself."
1,Flawed and Frustrating,"My mother bought this book for a cake recipe she and my son wanted to make. I wasn't present for that misadventure, but heard it was a disaster. My mom, an excellent cook, was so angry she wanted to throw the book in the trash. My wife saved it from an early demise.This evening, my wife made the Pecan Diamonds. As the recipe insisted, she followed it ""exactly"". We couldn't see how it would hold together, but did as told. The result was a pile of dry pecans sitting on top of a crust surrounded by a pool of the caramel that had melted out of them. It probably would have been fine if it had been cooked in a pan that contained it instead of in the middle of a large baking sheet, as directed. Obviously the author did not test his own recipe.Save your money, time and frustration. Do not buy this book."
3,The Colours of Christmas,If you like Christmas song you would like the CD but i really dont thing you would like if you dont
3,Too High Price!!,Why are you charging so much? Do you think money grows on trees? I have never paid this much for a cd. I would love to buy it if you would consider bringing down your price.
3,For kids who love trains!,I bought the train for my 2 yr old son last christmas and although it looked great set up under the tree it was very disappointing when the train kept derailing and getting stuck. We have it on carpet and although it may work better on hard wood it was alwful on carpet. My son loved it as did my 1 yr old daughter but I kept having to stand by to give a push or put the train back on track. It really looks so much better than it works. But it was worth the expression on my sons face when he first saw it - he loves everything trains!
2,Disappointing Choo-Choo,"Bought this for christmas for my son who turned 2 the week before. Train is cool but after a few minutes of riding it would not go if put on to travel counter-clockwise on the track. Then to travel clockwise the rear car had to be taken off because it travled derailed. In a 20 min span it derailed 3 times sending him off of it. He weighs about 22lbs. Constuction is ok. Some parts could have been a stronger plastic. Assembly easy. May be I just got a bad one, most the reviews seemed good. Very disappointed though it is going back. I will lose bout 50 bucks on shipping but rather get him somethen like a truck that won't tip over.Best o luck to anyone purchasing. It was great to see him laugh and smile while it was going. But I won't take the chase of him getting hurt."
4,Great Toy :),"We got this toy for my one and a half year old son. At first he was not very interested. But once he reached 2 he LOVED it! We have to charge it once a week becasue he'll ride it for so long! One draw back is that the button to ride the train as to be continuously oushed down, but once my son figured that out it was smooth sailing from there!"
4,Best thing since sliced bread!!!!,"My 20 month old son received this train for Christmas 2004 and he absolutely loves it. He rides it so long that he actually falls asleep on it. He can control it by himself which frees me up to do other things around the house. He can get on and off and operate all by himself. The only thing i'd ""warn"" (for lack of a better word)about is that when my son gets on by himself he tends to sit leaning on the side that he gets in on and the train won't move while he's in this position so, as long as he's sitting in the middle of the seat it works PERFECTLY."
5,Anyone who owns a Lab will love this book!,Fantastic photography; clever titles. Great stocking stuffer for a Lab owner!
2,... hmmm ... ?,"Having read the previous reviews, I'd expected to find little text, but had thought the photographs would prove sufficient ... unfortunately the photos are a little disappointing ... more like snap shots taken to fill up pages ..."
3,"Good, but could have been better...","I see that some people criticsized the previous Daredevil Masterworks volume for the coloring -- i.e. coloring was too garish. Well, unfortunately that again is the case with this volume. The coloring is garish and simplistic. This really backfires on the Gene Colan issues since his rendering technique had a subtletly and style to it. That type of illustration really calls for a corresponding subtlety and style in the coloring. Unfornatunately that's not what we get with these reprints. And didn't Frank Giacoia ink issue #20? ..."
4,"Classic, but--","Great artwork. John Romita. Gene Colan. Stan Lee at the helm. 'Nuff said.But what's interesting is to compare these issues with the Lee/Ditko Spiderman issues of the same time period. Daredevil's personal problems are weak and insipid, especially in comparison: ""Karen can't love me because I'm blind, etc."" An ace lawyer with super hearing should be able to detect her pulse picking up when he's near. Then later, ""I can't tell her I love her because Foggy loves her too."" Some of it reads like a bad ""Millie the Model"" issue. I can only think that the early issues covering DD's personal storyline were hindered because the artists (though all great) kept changing.Even with some lousy thought-balloons and odd plot twists, it's still early DD. It's still Marvel when it was creating one of its most unique characters. It still ran circles around the DC issues of that day."
1,You get what you pay for,"I was so excited to get this for my daughter's upcoming second birthday. We have the set of three large knob puzzles by the same maker and it is of great quality. This, however, is NOT of great or even good quality. It arrived with the case broken and the paint chipped. The paint chips by practically rubbing a finger on it. Also, the puzzles fit poorly in the case. Yes, I did keep it- only because I had free shipping and don't want to pay to send it back. The puzzles themselves are of mediocre quality. Like I said, you get what you pay for!"
4,Excellent price! Good quality too!!,"This piece is great for such a cheap price. Other puzzles that I bought for my 2 yd old usually cost about $10 for just one. You get four in this and a nice storage case too - teaches the kid some organization to do!!Yes, the quality is not that great (not meant for rough play), but, still good enough. The puzzle boards are a little thin compared to the ones that we have. The knobs seem okay, but not sure if they will last long because they are not held by screws. The pieces fit well and the pictures are good too. Amazon's shipping is VERY FAST as usual and excellent packing too.Bottom line: Excellent price, may not last longer than a year!"
1,"Not ""Burnished"" Bamboo","The definition of burnished is to make smooth by rubbing. This spatula is coated with something clear. I am afraid to use it. I have three other bamboo spatulas, and they do not have any coating on them."
2,Not my best bamboo utensil,"Just bought the Joyce Chen J33-2015 spatula and as expected made in China. I am a little concerned about the heavy clear coating applied to this product not knowing if its a food grade coating. I am not sure what will happen in a hot pot of acidic marinara sauce or very hot oils. I have bought othe bamboo tools and none have a protective type coating.The spatula is large and heavy which I like for those heavier cooking jobs, spatula front is thicker than all my others but I didn't plan on using it for flipping food. Item is warped moderately, and this is where I lost out by not buying from a selection in box store. Bamboo tools will usually have a twist or warp to it, just how much depends on the name behind it.I'll probably go back to seeing my wooden kitchen tools before buying."
4,Creepy and Cool,"My son is really interested in ancient Egypt and all the creepiness of the mummies. This toy satisfies that interest. The mummy is glued into the sarcophagus, but can be easily removed. The detail on it is incredible. The plastic is also pretty sturdy and a little rigid."
4,Mummy returns,"It's a little creepy, but my five year old daughter loves all things Egypt and loves this authentic, although small, looking model."
4,"Pretty face, frizzy hair","This doll has a pretty, and larger face (reminscent of Bratz dolls) than Barbie and with heavier makeup, fuller lips. She'll still fit into regular sized Barbie clothes though. Her body is glittery and she has on permanent ""undergarments"" so your kid can never strip her nude. If you try to undo the orange braided hair you'll wind up with a frizzful that you can try to comb out (may 4 year old thought she looked scary with the loopy braids)but it will still be a bit crimped in the front. The hair at the back is very nicely waved though.The wings are heavily glued on with visible silicone.Daughter liked the sunburst necklace bonus the best."
3,Blow hot & blow cold,"Charles Leydon comes to Leydon Hall as the new owner. He immediately starts to treat Alisoun Fairlie like a slave.And she takes it in her stride.It seems Alisoun married her elderly sick husband so that his three daughters would have someone to take care of them. Especially Jessamy who had polio as a child and was still cripple with it.Charles fell in love with Alisoun, but he never treated her like a man should treat a woman he is in love with.It comes as no surprise to me at the end of the book, that Alisoun has no idea that Charles is in love with her."
1,This modem sucks,"I'va had two of these modems with a 3Mbits DSL line, they both had the same problem : They work fine for about 3 weeks, and then blam, they just limit my bandwidth to ~128k, I have to unplug it, wait a little and then replug it ... At the begining I had to do that every 2/3 days, but now it's about every hour !If you have to buy a modem, buy alcatel modems !"
2,Not as easy to install,"I bought this modem thinking it will install easily, but it didn't. Wish it would of come with the installation cd or Speedstream had a downloadable driver."
4,Very contemporary and pretty,"Just be careful if the bottom of your glass is wet when you pick it up off the coaster. The coaster may stick to the glass. Someone did that with one of mine and the coaster fell on my hardwood floor. Thankfully, it didn't break."
2,Don't buy glass,These glass coasters keep sticking to the cup due to condensation and then fall off clanging after a little while.
3,ahem,"two remarks:1- The nude picture on the box (not shown on Amazon), repeated inside and even on the disc label, is uncalled for.2-Misou is definitely a loser, and unattractive to women. However, as soon as he establishes a budding sympathy with another shy person, all of a sudden all the pretty girls are all over him as if he were the most desirable male. Granted women are competitive, but..."
4,Great Cookies with too much unhealthy stuff,"These cookies taste great. but if you are health conscious, these cookies are not for you. I believe two cookies added up to about 150-200 calories with some trans fat. Great taste but unhealthy choice."
2,"TASTE GOOD, BUT WAY TOO MUCH SATURATED FAT!","I had wondered how HIT removed the trans fat from their cookies. While hoping that they would have replaced the ""bad fat"" with a poly or mono unsaturated fat they have chosen to go with palm and coconut oil, two of the nutritionally worst ""vegetable oils"", to make matters worse they fully hydrogenate these oils making the ratio of fat that is found in the cookies 86% saturated (6gm/7gm)!Nutritionally one could do better by picking almost any other cookie - so I'd recommend skipping this one."
1,"Worst ""cookies"" I've ever had.","These are not cookies, they're crackers, crackers with chocolate in them.Imagine a Ritz cracker without salt and chocalate cream on it and that is exactly what these tastes like. I've tried them with milk and they still taste bad.I'll try to find someone to give them too but if I can't I'll just throw the whole box in the trash."
3,Not the original,"The original Hit cookies had an almost-nutella creme center sandwiched by crispy cookies. This is sort of the reverse. The chocolate cookies taste a lot like the plain cookies but does lend a bit of chocolatey-ness to the overall flavor. The creme center is an average white creme filling like you would find in an Oreo.Basically, this is the less-subtle cousin to the nuanced original. It's much sweeter. But I have to ask, why not just eat an oreo?"
2,Didn't particularly like these...,"My family didn't really care for these cookies. If you haven't previously eaten European cookies, you may no like these. I have to also admit that after I made the purchase, I started to look at some of the previous reviews and I was appalled at how much calories and fat these cookies have. Granted, they're cookies for Heaven sakes (not health food), but don't be fooled into thinking that since you may find them a bit bland that they probably have less of the ""bad stuff"" in them.......Not so!Long and the short, if you've never tried these cookies before, I would strongly recommend that you sample a sleeve (if you can find them) in your grocery store so you don't get stuck with a case that may not be eaten if your family doesn't like them."
5,Great Cookies,"At the sale price you should buy two cases. Hits are the best cookies. I've been buying them for years. One reviewer compared them to Oreos. DON'T. There is no comparison. The biscuit is mild chocolate and the cream is not a thick tasteless glob; it's a really delicious vanilla cream filling. I highly recomment these in either variety -- chocolate biscuit with vanilla filling, or vanilla biscuit with chocolate filling. My family love them."
1,Hydrogenated Oil = Trans Fat = VERY BAD!!!,Foods using hydrogenated oils should come with an add-on Defibrillator.However these trans fat cookies might taste ... they can't be worth a clogged artery.
3,Not as good as I expected...,"These cookies were good but not great like I had hoped. For the amount of calories and fat you consume for each cookie, it really isn't worth it. I didn't find them to be very sweet either. They kind of reminded me of a biscuit type cookie which isn't what I was expecting. I'm sure some people will love them, they're just not for me."
5,My all-time favorite treat!,"My friend and I love these cookies and she shared with me that they aren't always carried by brick & mortar stores. So I jumped onto amazon.com and there they were. Big case (25 large packs) small case 12 packs and individual packs! We went in on a large case together and the cookies are wonderful. Very fresh. Sometimes one or two cookies in a pack might be broken, but I was amazed how intact the majority of cookies were. The shipping box looked like it had been through a war-zone. Great product. Shipment was a bit late, but when it arrived it was absolutely wonderful and well worth the wait."
5,Delicious cookies,"These were too much to resist because not only were they on sale, but Amazon had an online coupon for them, making them only 40 cents a package, with super saver shipping included. Even more amazingly, I ordered them yesterday, December 19, and they arrived today! I just opened a package to try them, and they are very fresh and tasty. They will go well on an afternoon with a cup of tea or coffee. Do yourself a favor and don't look at the package ingredients, and just have a couple a day for a treat. Since Amazon was so speedy, I can also use them as stocking stuffers in my Christmas bags."
4,Fab Biscuit,"This is a great twist on the classic Tea biscuit by adding a cocoa filling. Downgraded only for the mild chocolate flavor typical of cocoa. They're crisp, they dunk without falling apart. Try a box you won't be disappointed."
4,They're a hit with the UPS driver,Got these for my husband and then he stopped eating sugar so we started giving them to the UPS guy and he loves them. They are very good but full of sugar and calories. Got them on an Amazon sale; wouldn't want to pay full price for them.
4,"my favorite cookie, but what's with the price?","I don't usually care for sweets, but I really enjoy this cookie, especially the chocolate filling version. The wafers aren't overly sweet and have a filling like Nutella. What I don't understand is the price. These are available in my local grocery store for $1.19 per package. Same size, same brand. And please don't think that I must live in some metropolis of cool where all foodstuffs are available at all times. I live in West Virginia. And I don't even have to go to a specialty store for these. They're in the regular supermarket in one of the most backwards states in the nation. If I thought Amazon wouldn't kick me out, I'd offer to start my own Hits shipping business. But of course Amazon would kick me out, so I won't. I'm an avid Amazon shopper, but this is just silly."
3,Cheap Cookies,"These are decent cookies when bought at a discount from Amazon. They're light and not too sweet, but unfortunately are pretty crumbly. While it's nice that Bahlsen doesn't use trans fat, the hydrogenated filling has the cheap and greasy consistency of Crisco, and is loaded with saturated fat. Palm oil would make these a little healthier, butter would make them taste much better, but alas manufacturers must always use the cheapest ingredients possible. Since Bahlsen's price is much more reasonable than other manufacturers, and since they are superior to most brands (except the crumbs!), they are worth considering.The reviewers who claim these have a hazelnut filling have sensitive palates. While these cookies may or may not contain traces of hazelnuts, their filling tastes mundanely of cocoa."
5,Great fun for a 6 year old,"This was our first Xbox game and we loved it. My 6 year old daughter and I can play it together. It was difficult enough for her to find it interesting, but not too hard to get through the whole thing. She still goes back and plays each level over and over. Even my 3 year old loves the mini games like the shuffleboard game and the minigolf."
4,"Fun , But Easy","Madagascar is very fun, but pretty easy. It should be rated E instead of E10.There are pretty cool moves, like Marty's long jump, Gloria's butt bounce, Melman's Helicopter Spin and Gloria's Hip Check.There are 11 levels,I got to the last one on the second day,plus minigames like Tiki Minigolf , Shuffleboard and Lemur Rave.If you are a beginner, it might seem a little hard, but if you are an expert like me, it's EZ."
2,Bite your fingers instead,"I saw madegascar the movie and it was halirous while the the game is halurisly bad. Like most movie games it's very repatitive and boring. It's graphics are not the best but ok, and the scenery can't get any duller. So bite you fingers for amusment instead of getting this game. (...)"
3,Bach for Zombies,"Let me start out by confessing that I am not a musician. I have a rather extensive collection of Bach's compositions, but until recently, it didn't include The Art of the Fugue. I have watched this DVD three or four times and am still befuddled. Why is it played so slowly? The players look like zombies, which may explain the slow playing. I have had my HDTV for seven years now and have had no problems with the color balance until I played this DVD. The players have green faces and green arms. After adjusting the color balance they still look frightful.Besides being green, the players' dress and hairdos look like they are still living in fear of the Stasi and the brutal dictators during the worst days of the DDR.Let's compare this release to Bach's Brandenburg Concertos by the Freiburger Barockorchester on DVD by EuroArts. That DVD was recorded in Coethen Palace, a beautiful site where Bach composed. It looks beautiful on my HDTV."
2,Great Without Vista,"This machine is a FANTASTIC XP machine. The problem is its only ready for VISTA straight off the disk. I bought this machine because I couldn't wait another year for a new machine. Wasn't thrilled about vista (and no i don't hate microsoft) but because of the heavy system requirements it puts on the machine - i don't think this is a good machine for Vista.Wiped the hard drive clean which took care of my ""crapware"" problem also. Then loaded XP sp2. I had a really hard time getting drivers for this because it takes a lot of work arounds but i did manage it. Now I love this machine. Its a great XP machine and i wish HP would just come out and support this with XP drivers.A great buy if you have the time to load XP and are not gaming. Otherwise, Pay the extra for a better machine."
5,Romantic and sophisticated,Beautiful recording of all Copland works for violin and piano graciously shifting from the romantic tone to the intricacies of virtuosic complexity. It is a delight to hear this duo and to witness both performers' spontaneous abandon in the joy of music-making. Highly recommend!
2,Mediocre all around,"Lackluster performance, sounds as if it was recorded in a closet. Could this be why it was remaindered?"
1,Ummm...,They sent me a japanese poster instead of the one shown above so unless you speak japanese... you probably shouldn't buy this poster.Great movie though.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"...I was so disgusted by this book I felt compelled to warn others.All of the yeast breads are the same basic recipe. For example, the recipes for Bran Bread, Cinnamon Bread, and Dill Onion Bread differ only in that one has added bran, one has added cinnamon, and one has added dill and onion. I made the Garlic Parmesan Bread using the exact ingredients she lists, no substitutions, and it was one of the foulest tasting and textured foods I've ever put in my mouth. I could not even force myself to finish a full piece of the bread; I felt like I was trying to eat a sponge...P>On a side note, Morris Press Cookbooks really needs to hire a competent copy editor."
4,I Love your Bread & Breakfast Cookbook,"My husband was a die hard bread fan and has now been converted, quite happily, over to low carb eating..I love your book."
1,"Title should be ""Stanley Kubrick for Dummies""","This is a good example of a terrible trend--the dumbing down of arts books by authors and publishers eager to hop on the pop culture bandwagon and not put much effort into it. The book has zero insights, some truly bad writing, and a modest amount of information. As to the previous reviewer who found it ""refreshing"" that the author didn't know what one of the films was about--well, this is holding an author to a pretty low standard (Kubrick only made about 13 movies in his life!) And as to the reviewer's statement that this ""can and should be read at one sitting"" I would suggest that it would be impossible to read this tiny and insubstantial book at More than one sitting."
4,The classic Renaud album,"This is Renaud's second album and we can see that he knew more where he was heading. Known for his political and environmental ideas, Renaud knows how to blend humour to thoughtful lyrics and doesn't take himself too seriously. He sings about punks, rogues and petty thieves. The music is still acoustic and folksy. The language he uses is Parisian slang and can be hard to understand, even for a French. Laisse Beton and Marche a l'ombre are certainly the two albums that represents the best the ""old Renaud"". This album is ""beton""."
2,Old generation Norwegian!,"I found this book to be confusing, introducing new words and phrases without explanation and poorly demonstrating grammer/pronunciation. In addition, the Norwegian taught is old generation...in other words, you end up saying things that people laugh at when you're in Norway! Over and over again, I was told that people don't say things the way they were taught to me in the book...very disappointing for someone who is trying to pick up a difficult language like Norwegian. I definitely don't recommend."
1,terrible book,"I am not an expert on teaching languages but I have had ten years of language courses in high school and college, from latin to russian to french etc. I am American and my wife is Norwegian. This book is full of mistakes and anachronisms. If it was edited at all the publisher should fire the editors. The grammatical explanations are needlessly pedantic. Don't buy this book!"
2,Missed The Magic,"I'm apparently in the minority on this one.Wow, it's painful to see Canada - the homeland of many fine comics and comedic actors - fall flat on it's face with TPB. Neither a notable mockumentary nor comedy, what I watched was a bad film project.Did I get what they were trying here? Uh, yes. Still, it reminds me a bit of what is swept off of the cutting room floor of a skit comedy. I never laughed and moreover, found it rather depressing and a waste of my valuable time after a couple of episodes. NoPushover recommends watching an evening of Cops with real trailerparkers that'll at least make you giggle."
1,Do you have a rating for zero stars? or the worst ever,"Only goes to show that the public has reached an all-time low in their taste in T.V. shows. Cheech n Chong was funny, Beavis and Butthead was funny....this trash is just plain boring and stupid. Don't waste your money, unless you have a brain made of pond scum."
2,I love the show but the product has some downfalls,"OMG! This show cracks me up. These guys and their crazy shenanigans have brought me to tears more times than not. I have shared this with several people who had never heard of it and now they are buying their own dvds. There is, however, one issue I have with the quality of the product itself. The cover seems like a cheap copy of the original and the DVD's don't like to play in my DVD player. I usually have to put the disc in and take it out a few times to get it to work. It was the same way with all my friends who borrowed it to. The show is awesome but this DVD set is low budget."
5,TPB will rock your world,Great ensemble cast. each episode gets better than the last. Profane and witty. One of the best shows on the air right now.
1,Too Much Disappointed...,"I have waited for this DVD as a fan of Barclay James Harvest for a long time. Then what is this? The DVD showed a very poor concert at a small club with a poor picture quality as well. In addition, the singer's voice was too unstable to irritate my ear for one hour. Anyway I could not believe that this group was the same as the past members that lived in 1980 Berlin concert. You'd better try to get some CDs instead."
4,"Sorry, do not agree with the other reviews AT ALL!","Sometimes you just have to accept that what exists, exists and what doesn't, doesn't!While this is not ideal picture quality, (but really not that bad!) it has FANTASTIC performances of many of BJHs most important songs. It also has an extra track (Rock & roll lady) not credited on the cover. And by the way, the audio is spot on.One reason this is a 'must have' is that it has a live version of 'Play to the World' included - one of the great songs of all time. However, the entire 50 minutes is fab - and a record of BJHs first 25 years, recorded back in 1992. Mockingbird, Medicine Man, Play to the world, Life is for Living, Rock and roll lady, Poor Man's Moody Blues, Stand Up and Hymn.... how can you go wrong?Buy it... you won't regret it."
3,How to Rent a Fire Lookout in the Pacific Northwest,"This is a useful book, but you can now get the the same list of fire lookouts (including detailed descriptions, better pictures, driving directions, reservation links and current status) from the Forest Service [...]"
5,You must have it !,"Be sure that Try Yann is one of the best band of bretony music, based on traditional musics and/or texts reviewed with pop sound."
2,Tedious to Read,"I wanted to like ""Maiden,"" I really did, I just couldn't get into it. It's written in the first-person in a semi-stream-of-consciousness style and was, for me, almost impossible to enjoy, or follow. The moral dilemma and dichotomy of being a cynical virgin in today's society just wasn't enough to string together this rather random story, which lacked plot and pacing. It just wasn't enjoying to try and read--more like work, than fun. I focused so much on HOW the book was written (and it was poorly written, as far as I am concerned), I was never ever able to enjoy the story, such as it was."
3,Made Me Laugh....And Want to Throw it Across the Room,"I can agree with the criticism of ""Maiden""....the prose was a little grating, the writing style a little annoying, the era a little dated. But in the end, despite all its irritating qualities (and there were many), there was something about ""Maiden"" that I liked......somewhere underneath its gimmicky and disjointed style, it had a beating heart, and told a story of lonely spinsterhood (set against the back drop of the swinging seventies) with humor and sensitivity. As far as recomendations go, this book is definately not for everybody, but if you're up for something different and have the patience for less-than-linear storytelling, then its definatly worth a look."
2,Does not fit the L7C properly,"This looks like it would be a really great screen protector, but it is too big for the L7C's screen. I'm going to use it anyway, but the top overlaps onto the phone. I think it will still stick OK, but it doesn't look as nice."
5,I wish all screen protectors were like this one,"You'll receive one screen protector, a squeegee (a flat plastic thingy to help you apply the protector on the screen), a nice cloth and instructions. It wasn't really hard to apply it. Actually the hardest part was to keep the screen dust-less for enough time to apply the protector on it. Try to find a place in your house with a really small amount of dust around and no air drafts.The quality of the protector is really great and you hardly notice it after you've applied it on the screen."
1,A waste of time!,"To me, this book was boring. I have not read Ginny's and Steve's story, and honestly I don't want to, after reading this book. Laura is such a brat she got on my nerves. And I didn't feel sorry for her when she got kidnapped. Don't get me wrong know. I didn't want anything bad to happen to her, but I didn't like her. Like I said she really, really, got on my nerves!! And I don't know HOW in GOD'S world they fell in love. Trent was not the kind of guy you fall in love with. He was disrespectfull to her and was always calling her a ""PUTA"" (whore). The ONLY reason I finished reading the book, (or should I say skimmed the book?) was because a friend let me borrow it and I thought she might ask me questions. So if you can, skip this book. It's SUCKS!!!!"
1,Precious little romance in this novel,"Fans of Steve and Ginny hoping for equal passion with their now-grown daughter Laura will be disappointed. As a heroine, she's spoiled and brainless and I frankly didn't like her. She has no character traits with which to sympathize and neither does the hero.My main complaint is that there's little passion and still little romance although Rogers describes scenes of rape and sexual torture in loving detail. Although I'm not anti-lesbian, I prefer to see the heroine having sex with the hero rather than her female friends. This book left me feeling like I needed a bath and the violence is the stuff of nightmares. Avoid, or buy used!"
2,Laura and Trent,"Well, i've always had mixed feelings about Ms. Rogers books. Mainly the scenes of brutality in them. But this book was lacking those scenes and quite frankly, while a nice change that the heroine wasnt gettting slapped around repeatdly of raped, i rather missed them.Trent and Laura are engaged early in life. But theres hardly any history between them other then that. I felt the book was a bit rushed and just lacking in ways. Laura was annoying at times, and Trent was a complete mystery for most of the book. Call me crazy, but i like a little of the male point of view, to at least know something. Its like we never do know what brought them together, even at the end."
1,Paperback porn,"This book is so full of sex crimes, lesbians, bondage and totally moronic women that I wonder if it wasn't written by a man using a pen name. This is not romance and there is no love. Avoid and spend five bucks at Taco Bell instead, it's a better buy"
1,Big disappointment,"This book had almost no plot, and was totally unbelieveable. The ""kidnapping"" was so far-out as to be ludicrous. The Steve and Ginny books had characters you could believe in, but here the characters were just thrown together like puppets. Why did Trent Challenger (what a stupid name) do what he did? Why did Laura Morgan do what she did? It was too much to be believed. Hope the latest book is better."
1,Not worth the money,"I have owned this amp for several years, and during that time I have had to send it back to the manufacturer twice. Once because a part failed and the other time we had a power failure and the amp couldn't take it. It still isn't working properly. It sits on a shelf with plenty of air flow to keep it cool, but if I run three sets of speakers, out of a possible four, it will sometimes overreact and shutdown.This is just not a quality product. I wouldn't buy another one from this manufacturer."
4,"Good design, great concept, wish there was a bit more power","I was trying to figure out how to get audio from one central place to the kitchen, dining room, and patio. This sounded good on paper. I was going to use my computer as a source and also my iPod in a docking station in the kitchen. This unit only has one input, so I had to also buy a small stereo switcher to switch between them. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to put another source in the amp. That all being said, it's easy to hook up, seems well made, and has a straight forward interface with only a few buttons. This is a nice thing. The sound seems good, but I do wish it had a little more power in it when I decide to play the music loud (which is more often then not.) I will hopefully put in some of the wall remotes, as this will be a really nice thing to have, especially in the kitchen."
3,The totally forgotten champions,"The Beethoven violin sonatas? My champions are still ARTHUR GRUMIAUX and CLARA HASKIL. Their recordings of the Beethoven sonatas should be reissued. Believe me, they will make everybody re-evaluate their evaluations.Sudjoko, in Bandung, INDONESIA"
1,"Self-indulgent, exaggerated and nothing to do with Beethoven","I heard the Kreutzer on the radio and found it so repellent (but actually laughable) that I had to listen to the end just to know who was playing. I don't think I have ever heard a performance of a Beethoven work that more comprehensibly betrayed the spirit, integrity and sheer power of the music. A triumph of hype and marketing."
5,Superb Recording of Beethoven Sonatas,"Mutter/Orkis are superb together. Mutter is probably the only artist living today who plays Beethoven like it's under her skin. Clearly Mutter is the first artist to play with a musical, and historical intellect, and doesn't look at these works from a purely violinistic standpoint, as many of the artists of today do. 5 STARS!!Thanks, Mutter!!"
1,Dull and Duller,"The author is not up to his usual organized style. He wanders badly and one keeps waiting for the punch line, which never really comes. A waste of time."
4,Interesting,"This book is quite interesting compared to many other books on science I have looked at. The book builds on itself with each chapter. The first part of the book is about the earth and how we learned it's age/size. The rest of the book describes, in thourough detail, how scientists were able to find the age of the universe through various means. Gribbin does a great job captivating the reader with a sense of importance behind each scientific discovery.The only bad part about this novel is the fact that Gribbin often times explains theories that I can not begin to comprehend. Astronomy is relatively new to me, yet Gribbin will often go out on a tangent explaining how something works. There were a few times where I would not be able to understand anything because Gribbin, as one reviewer pointed out, did not put diagrams in his novel.Pick this novel up if you really want to comprehend how much time has gone into pin-pointing the age of the universe."
5,Are you ready to worship?,"This album isn't just about good music. It's about praising and worshipping the Lord. Dennis Jernigan's music attracts young and old because of his heart of worship. . . and this is none the less true with this album! I personally love this album. It provides variety in style; some songs will are more upbeat while others are more tranquil. Each one offers encouragement, strength, victory, challenge and refreshment--all of which we all need desperately at one time or another.For those who don't care for CCM because of the beat, let me say that I used to not like beats in my music. However, even though many of the songs on this album have a distinct beat, I have come to love them because it is evident that these songs aren't just sung for show, but to draw others into worshipping the Lord through song. This album will inspire you to worship with him as he sings. And as you sing, the music will lift you up, bring you cheer and comfort, delight and bless you!"
5,Can Push With One Hand - So Light Weight,This is the best stroller. It is really light weight and you can push it easily with one hand. I would never want to deal with those heavy stollers. This is also the only stroller rated for 2005 as excellent for safety by Consumer Reports!!!!
3,Not Great - Not Bad,"Positives:- very light weight, 9 lbs.- folds flat (but not as compact as a Combi)Negatives:- need two hands to open/close (holding a baby, good luck!)- small basket - can barely fit a very small diaper bag- sun shade is a joke, not even sure why there's one- wheels sometimes ""stick"" not always smooth- cup holder does not stay on, threw it away after one dayThis is an umbrella stroller on steroids (and the price reflects that). The only reason to get it is the light weight. My lovely wife, is 100 lbs. so there was no way we were going to buy the mega travel stroller. Some of the name ""stick-ons"" fell off in 4 months, that's not too bad, but it does reflect a little about the quality. The worst part by far is the two-handed operation. Had to set the baby on the cement one day to get it open. Both of us were not very happy."
1,Was broken by 9 months,Do not buy this stroller! I use it once a week and it broke before my son is just over 8 months old. It won't close. The wheels are hard to manage. AND most importantly the harness does not securely attach to the back of the stroller. It's a flimsy piece a plastic the easily slides out.
3,Was a great stroller for about a minute,"Before I bought the stroller, I read the reviews...I just wish I would've listened a little better. The sunshade is useless, and the cup holder should've been called ""key holder"". One of the reasons I bought the stroller was because it was so easy to steer. After a few months though, the steering has become difficult.The only good things about this stroller after almost a year, are how flat it folds, it's very light weight, and it reclines fairly flat.I do regret buying this stroller."
2,too hard to push-trying to return,"I purchased this stroller about 6 months ago & didn't really like it from day one! I love the over all look of the stoller, the snack tray is perfect, the under basket is pefect....but I can't steer the darn thing! It pulls hard to the side & for such a light weight stroller you'd think it would be easier to manover. I sent a e-mail to peg prego & the we're very helpful, told me to send it to them or to bring it to one of their local repair shops, but I think it's more of a design issue then it is a defect. I've read other reviews & spoke with other owners & they say the same thing. I'm disappointed because I love the look, but for now, I'm going back to using my VERY heavy Grecco stroller until I can find a better light weight stroller. It really is too bad, because I do love the way the Aria looks and it's accessories."
2,Should be better,"My wife hates this stroller. I'm not a fan either. First the good news. This is one light stroller. I didn't realize how light until I had to use someone elses. This thing is half the weight of a normal stroller and folded up it's much smaller too (think trunk space!)Now the bad. As others have said it does not want to go straight. You cannot push this with one hand. Mine pulls to the left always. 2nd, the cup holder for the kid pops out all the time. It's also very shallow so it's only good for a short sippy cup. Anything tall, including a bottle, will fall out when you hit a bump. The sunshade is tiny and basically does nothing. The basket on the bottom always comes undone and then it starts dragging on the ground. The straps are complicated and get tangled all the time. It can only be folded with 2 hands, no one handed folding.So, pass pass pass on this stroller! We're going to buy a new one to replace it."
4,Great light-weight stroller with a tray,"We've had this stroller for over a year now, and are very happy with it. The main thing I wanted a light weight stroller with a tray. I have an old Peg-Perego Pliko, but it didn't have a tray. The tray makes all the difference. It's so much easier to feed the baby while you're out somewhere. It's easy to fold and unfold.The basket is big enough to store a diaper bag. It's a great basket for this light stroller.The only thing the adult cup holder fell off after a couple of months of use. It's not very sturdy."
1,THE WORST STROLLER I HAVE BOUGHT!!!,"I got this stroller about 1 and 1/2 years ago. After only 6 months I havd to send it back for repairs. They replaced the frame and sent it back. I am dealing with the same problems again. It is very hard to push, and you can hardly turn this stroller with out using all of your body weight to do it.This stroller will be going in the trash and I will buy another GRACO. DONT WAST YOUR MONEY IT IS NOT WORTH THE $200."
2,would not recommend it,"I have this stroller for over 5 months now and I am regretting the day I chose this. It does not perform up to expectation. I thought peg was supposed to be quality but really it's not. After about 3 months of trying to get the hang of snapping my horrible peg infant car seat into the stroller, the cupholder kept coming off, the aria sticker on both sides came off, and the steering is terrible. The wheels never wants to go straight. I always have to push with both hands. Everyone who helped me pushed this stroller has had a bad experience with it. The only good thing about this stroller is the way it looks. My friend has the pliko and she's very happy with it. I recommend spending an extra 100 bucks if you want the looks and not the headache."
2,I almost hate it,"The only reason I don't totally hate this stroller is because it's lightweight and folds flat. It doesn't hold much at all, even my medium sized purse I have to bend over and shove a bit. The straps that adjust the seat broke (it slid all the way down and I have to unscrew it and modify it myself) after a couple months. It takes two hands to open it and to adjust the seat. The cupholder is a JOKE...it would barely fit a dixie cup. No coffee cup will fit in it, plus mine kept popping off in the trunk. The shoulder straps slide off all the time! I dont even use them anymore, just the waist straps. The :aria"" decal fell off (not that I really care) It doesn't drive great...and so on. For the money, it wasn't worth it. I'd say buy the cheaper compact version."
1,Wheels Fall Off,"We used this stroller 3x on even terrain. During a recent trip through a city park, the rear wheels separated (they come preassembled 2x2). The rest of the assembly remained locked on to the frame, but we were without wheels on the rear right side. Fortunately, I was walking next to the stroller to catch it as it toppled over. Do not buy this stroller. Customer service was not helpful. It is dangerous and a head injury in the making!"
4,About Karajan's Ring,"Amongst the works on this set is a series of excerpts from Karajan's masterful ""Ring"" from the late sixties. Much has been said about Karajan's approach to the Ring, but I'd like to especially recommend the first of the music-dramas (Das Rheingold): it is, in short and in my opinion, the most remarkable reading of this work available on disc - forget Solti, Levine and Barenboim, you'll be stunned to hear the life-like, soft-spoken (soft-sung), delicately played musical ""scherzo"" by Wagner. A scherzo it is, compared to the tragedy to come! I notice that unfortunately the prelude to Das Rheingold, an ethereal masterpiece, is NOT included in the extensive excerpts - why, I wonder?"
4,UK/DK... Brill!,"UK/DK... very nostalgic of the life and times, and attitudes of London punks who were living it. Also funny interview with Capt'n Sensible and The Damned crew. It also contains the full music video of The Blitz's ""New Age"" [rare] a track with the most addictive hook & riff of ANY punk song...(IMO) Brill doco."
4,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"A very good book, well thought out and reasoned, with a wealth of supporting evidence and facts. I can only imagine that the publishers thought that the title would somehow help to sell books, though the type of reader who is looking for books about demonic copulation would do better to browse the Anime section. For anyone who wishes to learn a little bit more about a very dark time in human history and an intriguing theory as to the driving motivations behind it will find this book invaluable."
4,Strange Flick,"This movie is really quite strange! Its starts out just a bit unusual, and it end up somewhere way out ""in the deep end"". Good movie though. Very ""arty"". Some laugh out loud moments, some WTF?!? moments. I liked it."
3,Raining on the Parade,"Well, 2 1/2 stars, but that isn't an option.I hate to disagree with the other reviewers of this CD who seem to think it is wonderful. I'll meet then halfway, and say that Bucky Pizzarelli is wonderful. As for Frank Vignola? He demonstrates a very tinny and nasally tone throughout. Some people like this timbre; I'm not one of them!!Overall it reminds me of that John Denver recording from the 80's, ""Perhaps Love"", where Johnny D joins up with Placido Domingo. John does fine in his own element, but once Maestro Domingo enters, the difference in skill level is painfully evident. Same here: Vignola is probably fine on his own, but put him up against a legend like Pizzarelli, and he ends up coming across as the proverbial ""chopped liver"".The liner notes by Joel Dorn are entertaining, if not relevant, except to demonstrate the writer's love of Italian cuisine."
5,Can't put this one down,"Ms. Hall weaves a tight, exciting, and suspenseful tale from the first page. Written in the first person, Sadie's Song, artfully puts the reader into Sadie's head as she goes about ""this little life of mine"" as she refers to it. Sadie lives with an abusive husband and five kids and the insurmountable task of looking like the happy, contented wife of a godly husband. The signs of abuse are all around her, from her comments about hoping dinner will come out just the way Troy likes it to a son who sits under furniture and growls. A missing child, mysterious music that only Sadie seems to hear, and a friend with enough secrets of her own, will keep the reader turning pages. I loved reading this book and wondered as I neared the end how everything would be wrapped up in the few remaining pages."
5,"nightmare marriage with an abusive, controlling husband","Wow! Another extremely fine story by Linda Hall. A Christian woman, mainly because of Biblical values and principles, feels that she should stay with a very increasingly abusive and control-freak husband who also likes to keep her ""barefoot and pregnant"". There's also the likelihood that he could be involved in the disappearances of two young girls. How can she not take action?! How can she tolerate the way her children are treated by this monster? This story should certainly be a wake-up call for all wives and I think it would definitely be a meaningful, worthwhile read for any woman, regardless of age (but especially young ones) who is planning a marriage. Perhaps it should be a prerequisite for a Marriage License? The issues examined in this book are definitely real-life."
5,Fascinating Story!,"This book gives you the perspective of an abused wife who is a very deeply devoted Christian who believes that all the faults in her marriage are related to her own failings, never wanting to admit that they could also be attributed to her husband. Having known women like this, I could easily identify with Sadie as she struggles to placate her husband and still maintain some semblance of a personal identity. The effect of their hidden family life on the children is sad and disturbing, especially when you read about how the husband was abused as a child--the cycle is just continuing on & on. The secondary story about a missing child and Sadie's developing friendship with the mother is interesting a provides an nice counterpoint to the situation at home."
4,DUKE,"Duke is very cool he looks very much like a Joe from the 70s with the life like hair. The uniform is very much authentic looking. The body is bulky and durable but not at all articulated. Overall Duke is a sweet Joe to have in a collection but he needs a more articulated body, its easy to pop off his head and use a big armed classic collection Gi Joe body to make him a lot more fun and articulated."
1,The groans don't come from the weakened bulkhead alone,"I don't know how dialogue and acting could be more forced and unnatural than they are in this film. And those scenes where people run into frame, shout something excitedly, and run right back out again! They just had to be the inspiration for that scene in ""Airplane!"" where Lloyd Bridges gives the first emergency orders to his staff. ""The Last Voyage"" is no doubt the reason, too, why Robert Stack was cast in the Abrahams/Zucker spoof."
5,Better than you think!,"This is a well-written and tightly crafted little film. It never pretends to be more than it is about. The film gets right to the dilemma with nearly the opening shot. There are very few special effects as the disaster is real. The real ship is really on fire! No need for CGI smoke and mirrors. George Sanders has a believable and restrained turn as the beleagured captain. Robert Stack is his usual no nonsense good guy. Woody Strode, a good underrated actor, also gives his usual solid bit part.What I liked most is the look of the film. Its not fake. The action is real because they really did burn the ship. This adds to the excitement and tension. This deserves to be on DVD."
5,A wonderfully suspenseful movie that never lags.,"This is a 'must see' film if you love disaster films, particularly those set at sea. It is a gripping, suspensful tale of courage, action and insight. It is at the top of the list thanks to its verisimilitude and grit. The final scenes will make you think twice--or three times--about taking a cruise. :) This film puts others to shame. Rent/buy it!"
3,The Last Voyage,"For it's day, they did a pretty good job of an Ocean Liner sinking, even if it was a very gradule sinking. It would have been nice to see the making of this film included on the DVD, as an extra Feature."
3,Au revoir Ile de France,"Not a bad movie, but the legendary Ile de France was the real ship Hollywood blew up. A humiliating end for a classic liner that served gallantly in WWII, and rescued survivors of the Andrea Doria."
4,adding to my previous review,PS to my previous review: great heroic part played by an Afro-American actor (how many like that do you find in the 60s?)
3,I love it for sentimental reasons; plus it's not bad.,"My late Dad and big brother had tiny roles: Dad is the journalist who first notices the smoke; my brother is playing in the nursery. The film itself is pretty suspenseful, with a little kid in danger."
4,better than john camerons titanic,this film was actullly fimed aboard a sinking ship. It is the story of a fire which led to a blast that would eventually sink the ship. As a result of the blast a wife was pinned under twisted debris. What followed was a race against time to free her while the crews had to tend to evacuation of the doomed ship. How much more realsim can you get when the film was made on what the story was about?
4,Great boat sinking movie!,This movie is so sharp and well put together. The opening scene starts it right off with the captain getting a note about a fire in the engine room. From that point on the ship is in trouble and the movie plays it out well. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are very good as is Woody Strode. Better than almost any other movie where a boat sinks!
2,Nice seeing the Ile de France...,"...one last time, but that's, ufortunately, the only redeeming factor here. The entire cast either under- or over-acts (mostly the latter), and the result is eye-rolling or leaden performances. Sanders and Strode are wasted, and Stack and Malone have, as noted elsewhere, no chemistry at all here. It almost plays like a high-school production. The narration borders on inane, and the final sinking scene is horribly done. Catch it on TV, unless you're a true vintage ocean-liner fan."
4,"An interesting disaster movie before ""The Poseidon Adventure""","I have just watched this movie with Robert Stack. It was worth spending the time! Robert Stack acts very well as the husband and father trying to save his family, wife and little girl from perishing inside a doomed ship. This is a 1960 movie but you really must not care about it as the action is endless and the emotional conflicts abound!"
5,Great Realism,"Even though not a blockbuster, it has a good plot, is very realistic and enjoyable to watch keeping you tense until the very last minute. Great finale when the former French liner le de France was really sunk to add to the realism of the film. What a difference from CGI times."
5,better than what i expected,better than i expected..bigger than i thought it was which is perfect this will make a wonderful gift to anyone
5,Beautiful!,This horse is sooo beautiful and soft. I can't wait to see our Grand-daughter's eyes when she opens this on Christmas day. She's going to love it!!
5,Adorable Aurora,"I purchased this on a whim for my two year old daughter who loves horses. For the price, I wasn't expecting much and yet was very pleasantly surprised. The quality is terrific (very soft and well made), she loves it, and enjoys ""galloping"" around the house on the horse to music. It's also nice to recline on while she plays games and puzzles. (I have used it for this purpose a time or two myself!) A fun buy at a great price."
5,An excellent anthology...,"Here Margaret Weis has put together (another) collection of gems by well-known and beloved writers in the fantasy genre. This is a fun book, chock-full of memorable, quirky, and original tales that might have been missed or mis-laid and never heard from again had not Weis collected and re-released them. It's worth a read, especially if you're a short-story fan, and it's worth a re-read every now and then. You really should do yourself a favor and buy it - quick, before it goes out of print!"
4,Lovely music and movie,"Lovely music, especially from The Ethiopians, like they say in the movie. Like the music, the movie is very worthwhile too.Yvon"
1,Broken Flowers,"the movie was good, but the music almost ruined it for me. if this had better music, it would have definatly been a better movie. the times where there was music i couldn't concentrate on the movie, i just wanted to cover my ears. even so, please do see the movie."
4,New Stuff,Some of the most pleasing music was new to me and the introduction was welcome. I had only passing acquaintance with Holly Golightly as an example. Unlike a lot of soundtracks this one hangs together and creates a consistent mood. No clunkers.
4,"good, but not as good as Ethiopiques","Great sound track. I loved the movie, mainly because I love watching Bill Murray, but even he couldn't have kept my interest if it wasn't for the music. It led me delightfully from one scene to the next. When I finished watching the movie, I said, ""what was that music, and where can I get it."""
3,funny,"This is one the very funny movies from Spain; but unfortunelly the quality of the DVD is really poor, that's why the 3 stars. But I repeat the movie is very funny."
5,A Fun Caper,"The characters are what made this movie so much fun. A single mother cleaning lady, a punk chick, a promiscious hair stylist and a rich widow all team up to rob a bank. The crooks in this film have so much concience, and their circumstances are ones that the average person can relate to.The dvd itself is good also as it has ""the making of"" segment, which I found to be rather humorous. The acting is great, great script, overall it is a very funny movie, its great to finally see some great comedy from Spain."
5,So much fun,"I hadn't heard this album in years so when I saw it here, I knew I had to have it. The track listings are a bit off but that's no big deal."
3,Seems ok....,"I've not camped with this head lamp yet, however it seems decent.Pros:Only $20Adjustable light (pivots up or down for directional lighting)Has a ""three strap"" mounting system not just a head band that goes from your forehead to the back of your headdecent light outputAA batteriesCons:Could be brighternow sure yet how far the light projects, I think the description is a little over zelous.Overall I believe worth the money for an ""every once in a while"" use or camper."
1,The print in this book is illegible,"I just received my copy of this book. I was disappointed to find that the print is essentially illegible. At the front of the book (the only legible page in it) it says:""Publishing Statement:This important reprint was made from an old and scarce book.Therefore, it may have defects such as missing pages, erroneous pagination, blurred pages, missing text, poor pictures, markings, marginalia and other issues beyond our control.Because this is such an important and rare work, we believe it is best to reproduce this book regardless of its original condition.Thank you for your understanding and enjoy this unique book!""I had hoped to read the book to my children, but will have to buy a different version which can actually be read."
1,ALL SHAKESPEARE'S TALES:.......,"THE BOOK LOOKED GREAT ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT THE PAGES WERE UNREADABLE! ABSOLUTELY USELESS."
1,Don't waste your time and money...,"...on this book, or any other book written by Dr. Lerner - especially those written regarding the reduction or prevention of miscarriages. In fact, you can find more accurate information on the internet.What Dr. Lerner doesn't tell you is that he runs a LOW risk practice, where most miscarriages are, in fact, due to a chromosomal mis-match, and occur very early in the pregnancy. Any testing for later-term pregnancy losses must be done outside of his practice.So - I suggest you find a HIGH risk Dr. to answer your questions regarding miscarriages, rather than wasting your time and money on this book."
1,Out of date and useless,"This is one of the most unhelpful books on miscarriage out there. I bought it when I was going through losses and quite honestly it made me feel like there was no hope and no answers. I now have two healthy boys as a result of the latest tests and treatments for immune system problems, thanks to being recommended the book by Dr Alan Beer. Finally, I discovered the reason for my losses and was able to get treated. I am writing this to save others from the heartache I went through."
5,Best Stats Text Ever,"As the authors point out at the beginning, this is a textbook that needs to be read. The best part is that the book is very readable. It's not just a list of definitions and formulas and then some boring examples. The authors help you to understand why you are doing what you are doing, what it really means, and how it connects to the real world. They have taken great care to provide interesting examples and follow them through from one concept to the next. I used to dread Stats, but this textbook has made the topic interesting and exciting because now Stats finally makes sense. I highly recommend this book."
4,book for a very good price,The book came in a timely manner and most importantly saved me almost a $100 if I had purchased it new at the school bookstore. It did not contain the CD-ROM but I didn't need it anyway.
2,"Great Recipes, Terrible Book Binding","I don't want to go chasing pages of my cookery books in the middle of a recipe!! This is likely one of the worst binding jobs I've ever encountered! While the recipes are tasty and look great, the book itself makes it impossible to recommend."
4,A decent Cold War film,"Most people today may scoff at the idea of a high school kid developing a nuclear weapon for a science fair, all to make a point about the evils of said weapon. However, this movie does a good job of capturing the zeitgeist of the mid-80s. This is also one of the first movies I remember seeing John Lithgow in and he does a respectable job in this film. This movie may not appeal to younger viewers, but for children of the 80s and older, this will be a good reminder of the paranoia and concern during the Cold War. War Games with Matthew Broderick is also another film in this genre that I would recommend for a double-feature."
2,Preposterous!,"The first half of this movie was interesting...then it got a little silly...then it got downright laughable. A high school kid creates a nuclear bomb that could destroy a city. He enters it into a science fair. Are you still with me? Ok, so the kid's name is all over the news as a nuclear terrorist. The bomb he made (partly out of salad bowls, mind you) could have killed thousands of people. The kid should be sent to prison for life, right? Oh, wait, the kid only wanted to alert the community about a secret government project, so all is forgiven, and his mom gives him a big hug as he walks out of the nuclear facility! It doesn't get more ridiculous than that."
1,Horrible,"Wasn't funny at all, the movie itself is a joke though. Weapon's grade plutinum facility guarded by a single security guard which is a total joke. Kid makes an atomic bomb that can blow up all his family and friends but he doesn't seem to give a care and he is applauded as a hero after threatening everyone with it and it almost killing everyone.Doesn't make a whole lot of sense for a movie that was trying to relay a message in which it didn't accomplish that either."
3,Not the best but better than watching a blank screen.,I expected a more detailed story of the real Manhatten Project.I'm sure the kids will like this movie.
2,Audio & Visuals poor. Only good as historical document.,"Before getting this I expected that the Visuals might be Poor (bootleg visuals) with adequate Audio (band or sound board recordings). I was right about the Visuals, but unfortunately the audio is just as poor.The entire 2nd dvd of bootleg concerts sounds as if it was recorded on a 1970's boombox. Almost unwatchable.The 1st dvd is OK in places. The Commonwealth School set audio/visual is OK. The Middle East footage is OK (interesting to me b/c I go there). Some of the Kennel Club is OK. The BBC is very good but no drums, all 3 play guitar, bass. The videos stink (why is the sound so bad?).Whoever thought this was worth releasing has a lot of nerve."
2,dysfunctional bugs,"The author had a clever idea, but was unable to think it through consistently. Within its frame, it could have been an adult book, as the story of Natasha and Sam show. The other part of it could have been a children's book (properly illustrated)to catch a child's imagination. As it is, the book is neither here nor there. Special thanks, however, have to go to the fabulous translation by Andrew Bromfield."
2,Bugs going nowhere.,"I found the book hard to follow, I am an avid reader and was very disappointed. One part I liked was with the bat, but I didn't even finished it. It was a waste of money for me."
3,"Promises Insight, but Little Delivered","I am a fan of Dr Baumeister generally, because he is a social psychologist, (that is observation oriented) but interested in human functioning, (presumably open to subjective and emotional experience). But in this book, he presents no theory of human functioning, or theory of personality, or theory of happiness, or even, as others have pointed out, a theory of self. Though the practices he singles out seem reasonable candidates for being deemed less-than-growth-producing, one gets the impression that he points them out because they are things he doesn't do. And because he doesn't do them, he seems to have only superficial insight into why others do."
1,Basic,"I managed to pull my way through the enitire book hoping to gather some amazing insight hidden in the obvious, but never found it. The book had a great concept but to me was just common sense. I wanted a dr point of view as to why we do these things, not that we do these things.....and perhaps other ways of coping, but nope. Just obvious stuff. Anyway Im using it as fire starter in my fire pit thats how I feel about it, just my opinion."
3,Meh.,"Reading hooks takes a lot of critical thinking in my opinion. She has some great theories and concepts, but I think there are better feminist theory writers out there."
3,Kids Love Thomas,my Son Adores Thomas & his Friends on Sodor Island. This just adds to the fun and imagination.
2,Too abstract,"This book is full of excellent information with tools and methodologies for future systems analyst work BUT the information is so abstract. There are no real practical examples in any of the chapters which would make it easier for me to grasp it (not to mention help with the assigned homework). Unlike most college subjects and textbooks that have three or more examples at the beginning of a chapter, this book has little if any at all."
3,"Good fork, but tines are not stiff enough","Love the design of this fork, but two quibbles: (1) it could be an inch longer, and (2) while the tines are sharp, the tips flex too easily under pressure or the weight of big piece of meat. Got the Cuisinart nylon fork, whose tines are not as sharp, but very stiff."
2,Not sturdy enough at all,"I bought a couple of these to replace my metal forks so I wouldn't scratch my new cookware, but they are not nearly sturdy enough. I tried to lift a 4 lb. roast with one of these and it bent to the point where I thought it was going to break. I'm chucking these and ordering Oxo Good Grips Nylon Fork."
2,Not very good--Tines are not stiff!,"I love every other Calphalon utensil that I own, but not this one. The reason is that the tines are not very stiff and make it hard to lift lift anything with some heft. If you want a fork that can turn a whole chicken or a pot roast, stick with a nice stainless steel model."
3,"Quality fork, just too short. Recommend OXO brand instead.","This is a great Nylon Fork. However, i would recommend the OXO brand Nylon Fork; it is several inches longer, and feels a little more solid. The best usage for this is for stirring pasta, rice, scrambled eggs, etc in non-stick cookware; i wouldn't recommend it for use with stabbing meat or potatos. I love these for cooking cuz i can stir the food without displacing it in the pan."
4,Suprisingly useable,Being made of nylon (plastic) I assumed the prongs would bend or flex when picking up food to put on your plate. To my suprise the little prongs held up very well and actually did pick up the food easily. The silicone insert handle is great.
3,I prefer the bamboo fork.,"I bought both the Bambu Kitchen Fork and the Cephalon Nylon Fork a year ago, both for use with non-stick kitchen pans.I used both, but have settled on the bamboo fork. That's what I reach for most times.The nylon fork has sharp tines that will pick up meat pieces; the bamboo fork does not do that job.The bamboo fork shrugs off encounters with hot pans; the nylon fork as gouges melted into it.Your mileage may vary. Void where prohibited..."
3,plastic forks are not strong enough,plastic forks are strong enough to do what I want to use them for.I use big forks for handling large pieces of meat and they flex too much to be secure.
3,"Great for nonstick cookware, wish it were longer","Bought this fork specifically for bacon. It's strong enough to lift/flip big pieces, but I wish it were longer. I'm not sure how long it will last, the tines are thin and look like they will melt/break over time. I've been using it about four months; the ends of the tines are a bit curled.This fork will not damage your teflon/calphalon cookware, so it serves its purpose, but even for non-spitty foods other than bacon, it is a pretty short for a cooking fork."
1,the kitschmeister dishes,"if you have heard of Schnabel, the illustrations in this book will persuade you that it's best not to see his work. If you would like to read the autobiography of a mediocre painter and consummate poser, this book might be for you."
1,Serenity/ Restful River,"I found this CD didn't help because although the sounds are nice, they were covered by the music and hence I didn't find it relaxing. The balance of music and nature sounds were not good."
2,Good for beginers,"This book is really basic animation and modelling. It doesn't go into detail much about the animation part the author just tell you to copy his pictures, which I don't feel teached somebody to animate. If your a beginner at max this book will help but for more advanced users its pretty useless."
2,Med-Surg Notes,In my opinion this was not a good tool for when I went to clinicals. This little spiral notebook sounded ideal- yet it is just not. I found that a good drug book recommended by faculty was the best reference I kept going and pulling out of my bag on the floor. Don't spend your money on this when there are tons of study tools that would better suit you.
1,do not buy this,"This lotion smells nothing at all like nutmeg (a smell I love), though it does have a strong unknown odor which isn't pleasant. And, worst of all the company does not allow you to return things. So I bought it and now it's in the trash. No one at work wanted either...once they smelled it."
3,mixed feelings,"Great product, once i got the right one. they sent me the wrong cable twice in a row. issue wasent resolved until i threatened to file a complaint. then they finally sent the right one."
4,"New York, Empire City: 1920-1945",No regrets but I wish there were more photos of the city and street scenes.
4,Ageless and timeless New York,"A wonderful pictoral history of early 20th century New York. One will be astounded at the space between the buildings of the city and the level of architecture throughout. In our daily hustle, this book reminds us of the beauty of the many buildings that make up the skyline of New York. Enjoy."
3,Good for the money,Came in a plain brown box so it wasn't exciting for my nephews to open it. Also the pieces didn't seem to quite fit together squarely. They needed to be cut out about 1/8 of an inch more.
2,"Keep looking, there are better socks out there","the maps on these socks are not standard reflexology, but somebody's playful idea. There are reflexology socks out there, I am looking at a photo on Ebay that has red, pink, and purple charts on white socks, with very specific and standard reflex areas for the colon, kidneys, lungs, etc."
5,Awesome macrophotographs,The photographs are outstanding and the text behind gives a good idea of the threats that many of these small creatures face. Thanks to our societies that will lead most of the animals to extinction!
2,Poorly Manufactured DVD,"As mentioned in the other review, this DVD skips in one of my Sony DVD players. It works on my computers and a different Sony DVD player. I cannot find on the [...]website so I cannot complain to themAs for the footage, The Lost Concert is 2 cam and poor quality. The performance is fine as Steve is not drunk but for die hard fans only.The Astoria footage is professional and great. Frampton is in great spirits as is Ian McLagan. It's enough to make me want to buy the whole thing, and it saves this release.Bottom Line: die hard fans only. Beware that you may have problems on your DVD player. If I could complain to the company, I would!"
2,A litte disappointed,Recipes aren't actually that great tasting -- they are OK. Some ingredients are hard to find.
3,Zone cooking not made easy.,"These recipes must be adapted for a woman, and they are a lot of work to prepare; although a great use of leftovers."
2,A little mislead,"I bought this book thinking that it would have new recipe ideas for the zone diet; as after a while chicken, eggs, beans and vegetables get a bit boring.The problem I have with this book is that the zone diet has set macronutrient guide lines (40% carbohydrates, 30% protein and 30% fat in relation to calories) which this book in my opinion completely ignores.I expected this book to have 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 block meal recipes but instead had recipes with the macronutrients listed at the end, however the macronutrients were no where near within the set guide lines of the zone diet. It seems this book is like any other cookbook with a little nutritional information for each recipe and thats it.If were you interested in starting the zone diet I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Zone confusing,"I do not like this book. I was expecting a spin off from the original ""Zone diet"" by Barry Sears. This book changes the process from blocks to grams, much more confusing . The layout of the recipes further complicates. I ask myself , is this a complete meal recipe or just a partial representation to which I must add more grams? I am sorry I ordered this book."
3,ok but will pass,"this album is historicaly innacurate (instrument wise). It is pleasing to the ear. i would reccomend it, but it does have it's drawbacks. One is that the instruments are not Baroque period instrumnets. Another is the way the album was recomposed by someone other than Bach. I will give it credit though. I do like the ""up beatedness"" and the modern touch to it. I reccomend another recording by Wolfgang Helbich. It's called ""Bach:Apocryphal St. Luke Passion BWV.246, Anh.II,30""I love it espescialy the emotional Sinfonia."
5,Wonderful book for kids... and big kids,"Fantastic verse, so clever and creative. A joy to read again and again. Try it with a pirate voice, the audience will LOVE it!"
2,"Tried It, Returned It","I am not here to slam the product, but I will say that I gave iTrip a fair trial and returned it because I found it useless for my needs.Assessment:- Using in an urban area with many radio stations will cause the need to switch frequencies very often - like twice per song. This can not be done easily while driving.- If you use this on long car trips, you will need to switch the frequency often enough to be annoying.- I am not an audiophile, but I found the static distracting.- The unit is small and easy to use. If it worked, it would be awesome.I used to use an FM transmitter to play songs from my computer through my downstairs stereo. That was 4 years ago, and it looks like the technology has not advanced any since then. If you simply intend to play your iPod though your home stereo, I recommend a direct cable connection. iTrip is simply not a good solution for automobile use."
3,ITRIP: GOOD OR BAD?,"1. Drains Power really fast2. Works better with ""alarm clock radios"" rather than Stereo Systems.3. the broadcasting diameter is LACKING!...around 5 feet is the most.4. However, you can use it almost anywhere...so it does have a purpose.5. Good for short trips (but won't last long enough for road trips)"
1,"Great design, terrible reception","I was *really* disappointed with the sound--lots of static and some strange whistles. I couldn't get a clear signal with it but, switching immediately to the older model, had no problem. Seeing that there some very positive reviews, I'm wondering if there's a problem with quality control in the manufacturing."
1,Do not buy for your car - buy the Road Trip instead,"I bought the Griffin Road Trip first and I am very happy with it. It works great, and I live in Altadena, CA (Los Angeles area)with radio stations in every frequency. I bought the iTrip in order to use the ipod at home or for situations where mobility is needed. It does not work in the home or in the car. I totally agree with the reviewer who said that it probably has to do with the fact that it draws power fron the ipod itself, so it sounds like a weak radio station, lots of static and noise. It works only when you place it very close to the receiver. It does look good however."
4,it's all right...,it was not what i was expecting... but still ok... probably 96kbps... quality... still all right for the price... but if u want something with 320kbps quality... do not buy this product...
1,Poor product. Don't buy!,"Please don't waste your money on this product. It may looks nice outside and fit on your ipod, but its FM signal is too weak to send good FM to radio."
1,non-compatible,"This item claims to be compatible with i-photo..I received the new ipod video 30g for christmas and this product is not compatible, even though the griffin web site says it is."
3,P.O.S.,"This thing isn't strong enought, but I'm glad I only bought a used one or this review would be more angry than it is. Save your money, buy the other one that charges yopur iPod as well."
1,Spend More Money,"The original Griffin ($20.) ITrip worked great. The new bites. I even had the company that sells it through Amazon replace it. Don't waste your money. I bought a more expensive ITrip and it works very well, not perfect but worth the money."
2,A cheap substitute for expensive rivals,"All in all, it serves its purpose. However, the sound quality is not up to par and you will find radio interuption to be a common occurance. If you are looking for high quality reception, spend the extra bucks on an upgrade."
2,"Useful, but really not","I got this item after seeing a friend's. His worked excellently, giving great reception in a car. This might have been because we were in a small town with not many radio stations, but after seeing other people's responses, it probably wasn't. When I tried using it in my car, all I got was static, and it eventually just forced me to turn on the radio and return the product."
2,"Wanted to like it, but....","I live in a rural area -- lots of empty stations. Even with the iTrip a few feet away from my stereo receiver's antenna, and moving it around, I could't get a decent signal. Lots of static and fadeouts, and very thin sound.I love the design and idea of it, but I knew I'd never want to listen with it.I'm trying a charger/dock connector transmitter next...if that's no better, I give up."
1,What a drop in quality!,"My 2 year old broke my old iTrip. So I bought this one. I was kinda glad since I no longer had to keep the iTrip tuning files on my iPod.Nice idea. Too bad the product sucks! In the first place there is no 87.9 on the dial. It start from 88.1 It works well so long as the iPod is placed less than a foot from the radio. The moment you move it to beyond 18"", the static starts. Beyond 2', you can barely hear the music through the noise. Even less than a foot, the volume is low.This is a huge down turn in quality. The old iTrip was great. I bought a griffen car charger. It's DOA. No more Griffen products for me."
1,Can't find an empty station in NY,"If you can't find an empty station in your car,then this is just a piece of junk!I am selling it."
4,I love it !!,"I was very hesitant to buy this product after having read some of these horrible reviews. However after reading one of the less recent and more positive statements I decided to take a chance and buy it.And I'm very happy now! The itrip works nicely in my car, as well as at home. And this for a price that can't be beat.I don't have any doubt however, that unfortunately this gadget doesn't always live up to its promise. I guess you have to be lucky with the kind of car you're driving, the area you live in etc. in order for this thing to work.So, in case you are living in Germany, driving a recent VW Passat model with a Volkswagen radio, then you should be o.k.I for myself am happily enjoying my favorite tunes on the road."
3,"A great concept, not well-executed","Don't get me wrong, I am very pleased that I bought htis item, but that's simply because I knew what I was getting myself into. Don't expect crystal-clear reception, because it's rare that you'll get it without having to hold the unit at some awkward angle. I've had this work from over 25 feet away, and I've had it right next to the FM antenna of a radio and it gets fuzzy, so the output is a VERY fickle and directional signal. Not a bad idea, but there is much room for improvement."
1,Not for iPOD video,"Note: This is not compatible with the newest iPod Video models. The description makes it sound like it might be, but don't make this mistake (like I did)."
3,Good For Ipod Minis,This transmitter is only good if you have the same ports on top like the minis. Make sure to check your ports first before you order this product because I did and I have an Ipod Mini.
1,Never worked at all,"I got this as a gift from my son. I tried it at home and it turned on the first time and worked ok with my stereo, but when I brought it to my car a week later, it didn't power on. I brought it into the Mac store and they tested it on another iPod and in fact it didn't work on that one either. So I never got to see how the reception was. And to add insult to injury, I can't seem to find the order on amazon, though he swears he bought it here but it's not in his account log, so it is a big mystery and I can't even return it."
1,"Do yourself a favor, buy the Cassette Tape adapter","The quality of this item is shotty at best. From both the car and different home stereo's, sometimes it's clear and sometimes it sucks bad. If you the stereo you wanna use has a tape player, buy a cheap converter and you'll be MUCH HAPPIER!"
4,Almost replaced my original iTrip... almost.,"I bought this particular iTrip for my fourth generation click-wheel iPod because the hardware approach to tuning to stations seemed more reliable than the software approach of my older iTrip. Unfortunately, there's only ONE available frequency where I live that I can transmit to without interference --- FM 87.9. To my dismay, this newer iTrip doesn't offer that channel! FM 88.1 is the lowest frequency. This iTrip will work fine for anyone not needing the lower frequencies. As for my older iTrip, I improved it's reliability by deleting all unused channels from the menu."
3,It works but it's not medal-worthy,"Bought this for my iPod Photo to use in my beater Hyundai (broken antenna) until it crapped out (the car, not the transmitter). It worked fine as long as I set the pod in the ashtray, any further and there was too much static! Now I have a little Honda CRX (with an actual radio antenna) and it sounds like garbage. I suspect it's due to my new stereo being able to actually receive radio signals - all those lesser stations I used to use have music on them w/ an antenna. I've used this in people's houses too but nothing beats a direct link via 1/8"" stereo cable. For now I'll stick to CDs and find a decent cigarette lighter w/ USB and 1/8"" inputs..."
3,Not compatible with ipod video :(,"I got my ipod for christmas and quickly read up on fm transmitters (i wanted to play it in my car) I finally decided on the i-trip. However, i didn't have all the information. No one ever pointed out to me that an i-pod video was different than an i-pod photo. The product stats only said what it was complatble with. I have an ipod video and figured that that because it was compatible with the photo. but it's not, so now I am once again searching for a transmitter--hopefully one that gets as great of reviews as the itrip"
3,works okay,"this thing works about as well as you'd expect. I live in a metro area (Salt Lake) that is pretty saturated station wise, so there aren't many available frequencies. That said I found one that worked adequately (107.1). If this is your only option, it'll work. Biggest problem I noticed is I had to turn the volume up too high on the radio, which makes static really annoying during soft sections of music, breaks between songs, etc. If you turn the ipod up lounder I found it sounded even worse. The itrip is supposed to adjust volume levels automatically, this feature doesn't seem to work very well.You can find a decent car stereo online with an aux jack for about $80 at crutchfield, which is the way I'm going. The itrip works, but it makes your ipod sound like an am radio."
4,Great for my commute,"Too bad this is my only option for feeding my Ipod through my car stereo. Although not perfect it seems to give better reception over earlier models. I like the digital LCD which allows you to sync up with your current radio station. In south Orange County I typically use 91.9 and get better than average reception. I typically use it for audio books and podcasts, which perform well and music seems to perform even better. If you don't have a tape deck this may be your next best option.It does impact battery life of my Ipod to the point where I need to recharge after about 4 hours."
3,Good performance but consuming batery very fast,The only problem is that you have to recharge your IPOD many times when you are using it.Some times IPOD becomes freezed.
1,not what i thought,"my fault, make sure you have the correct ipod to use this if you buy it, it isn't for the newer ipods."
1,Dissappointed. Doesn't work with 2nd gen Ipod Nano,Apple moved the connector location a couple of millimeters and accessories for older ipods don't work. Would like item descriptions modified to reflect this.
1,J. Lowe,"Our daughter could not use this itrip because it seemed to only fit some older model. She thought it was set to fit her new apple ipod, but the fittings in no way were compatible.We really need to return it but do not have the paperwork."
2,No es bueno,En realidad no me parece un producto que valga la pena.Tienes que tener el iPod encima del radio para que puedas escuchar bien la Musica.No lo volveria a comprar.
1,Pathetic Performance,"I generally liked this unit's predecessor, but found its playlist-based tuning to be a pain. So I bought this one. I am sorely disappointed. This unit is pathetic. There is so much interference and its signal is far too weak. It does improve markedly when the iPod is powered by the cigarette lighter. But I bought this unit to function on its own, without requiring external power. It is useless in that regard. Better to buy Monster's combination charger/transmitter that can also be used with a Nano. It actually works, providing vastly better sound than this does. It sounds better than the iTrip even when the iTrip is used in conjunction with external power. The Monster's only drawback is its limited frequency range. This iTrip is a complete waste of money."
3,bad power design on the prongs,"Watch out for the power prong part. It's made of very cheap plastic, after about a year the plastic piece fell out leaving only the 4 metal elements. 2 of the elements remained intact, but the metal elements on the other side got pushed in."
1,Poor Reception - Low Volume,"I used the iTrip with an iPod Nano, it connected fine but performed poorly. Both inside my house using a stereo and used in the car the reception was poor regardless of which frequency I tried and throughtout listening there was lots of crackling to be heard, also the volume had to be turned way up to hear anything at all.This was with the iPod within 2 feet of the radio antenna inside, and within 5 feet when using in the car.I returned it and the manager of the store said a lot of iTrips were being returned by unsatisfied customers.Save your money and time, look for a different solution."
2,Not good,"The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!!,Do not invest your money in this. There is no way to get a clear transmission. Static on every empty station I tried. It works but be aware it has very low sound quality.
1,No static but NO VOLUME,"Okay so I am not having the static problems that most other people seem to be having. My problem has been the auto adjust volume control. When I have my station and the music is playing the volume is turned ALL the way down. If I turn up my car speakers then I can faintly- and by faintly I mean like a whisper- hear it and then I do have static and other not so nice stuff to hear. If I use the scroll wheel to turn the volume up the music sounds fine (as long as I keep scrolling). When I stop scrolling the volume automatically gets turned all the way down again...this is extremely frustrating and I wish I knew what to do about it. If the volume worked I would give it a higher rating as, like I said, haven't had problems with finding a clear station. Thank goodness I have a tape deck in my car- I'll be researching those adaptors for my next purchase!"
2,this sucks sometimes,if you are using this for your house. then it is very good and i would recommend it. ON THE OTHER HAND. if you are using the I Trip for your car or truck. it isnt the best by far. BUT if you have a device that can point your ipod at the stereo at all times then its kinda good. but for the average drives get a cassestte adapter
2,"Great, but you will sacrifice the sound quality...","Both old and new iTrips work well, however, the 4026 is easier to tune to different frequencies. If you have a chance, buy the older iTrip 4014 instead of this 4026. The FCC ruling about FM transmitters changed how the iTrip works from 2004 to 2005. If you have a good ear for music you will notice the substantial drop in sharpness and separation."
3,it works?,"it works, the downside with things like this is that it doesn't broadcast strong enough, my as soon as my radio senses their might be a stronger signal it will start to get interference, i ended up just using a tape adapter. it also pulls from your ipod battery draining it faster."
4,"Great little item, simply great","Some people seem to have had issues but I loved mine. I live in the Boston area and the iTrip always worked fine in the 88.3-88.5 range. Not fantastic sound but more than adequate. The portability is a huge plus as well - I used it for playing my iPod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling, radios at friends' houses, on and on. The iTrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable. I have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently.For the price and the convenience you can't beat this thing.The only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of iPods."
2,Inferior to original iTrip,"I had great success with the original iTrip until its connector broke. It provided great signal and stayed on securely. Purchased this one to replace it, and had tremendous difficulty keeping it connected when my iPod was in its iSkin. The slightest touch causes it to pop off and turn off. I understand that it's not Griffin's responsibility to make their FM transmitters fit with cases, but it seemed like an unnecessary and regressive change. Once I filed down the bottom, I was able to test it in my car. Unfortunately, when I set this iTrip to the same stations and put it in the same places I put the original, the reception is absolutely terrible. Along with this, there's a static blip that sounds between tracks. Overall, it's performance is unacceptable."
2,Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter is a poor product,"The range of iTrip is horrible - both in car and at home, worse than advertised. Found Monster FM transmitter (with iPOD recharge capability) in car to be a much better option. Still looking for something to use at home."
1,"0 functionality, 0 starts","There's a reason this thing is on sale, and retailers are cutting the price now that Christmas is over... it doesn't work. I followed the instructions to the letter and tried it every which way but I get absolutely no sound; not poor sound quality, not poor reception, nothing. Dead air. And I live in a rural area, where the FM waves aren't exactly crowded. The teasers on the box make it sound easy, ""simply plug it in, tune in the pre-set station, and listen to your iPod."" Yeah, it's simple alright, it simply doesn't work. So I simply returned it the same day I bought it."
1,Do not buy this POS,"This was a total waste of moneyDifficult to set up and when it was, you had to put the thing directly next to the radio to get any reception. And that reception was LOUSY.Avoid this product like it has fleas"
2,not worth it,"After reading the 1st 2 reviews, I decided to give my own. In my car, the sound quality is somewhat better than AM stations, similar to the first review stated. I didn't expect an FM transmitter to give the same sound quality as a line-in device, but I did hope it would be closer to a normal FM radio station, which this new iTrip fails to do, IMHO. I also experienced static in around town, and it's true that I could try to look for another frequency that sounds cleaner, but that's a hassle to me when I'm driving. The design of the device is nice, but I wish it performed as nicely as it looks."
1,No good at all.,"Don't buy this. You can definitely try something else. This does reproduce sound, but keeps emitting a beeping sound every once in a while through your music. If you have a late generation Ipod, this is no good either. Try something else."
4,It works okay.,"It works like I thought, but sometimes the radio stations get fuzzy and I can't hear the music very well. But most of the time it works okay."
2,They got it right the first time,"I'm giving this thing two stars as my way of giving it the benefit of the doubt.I have a 3rd generation iPod. It came with a dock and four press pad buttons, in addition to its wheel interface.Anyway, though the new iTrip is supposeds to work with this generation of iPod it didn't, even if the connectors do match up.But, when I tracked down an original generation iTrip it worked great.So if you have the classic iPod I describe, stick with the classic iTrip and leave that LCD iTrip alone."
1,no star for this one,waste of money.i wasted my time attempting to get a better sound.all static.worst product ever... all hype.
1,piece of garbage,"if you like static, get the iTrip.if you like wasting money, get the iTrip.if you like cheap flimsey plastic, get the iTrip.if you like buying products that don't work as they are hyped, buy the iTrip."
3,A book full of leftovers,"This is a fun little book showing off Chas Addam's morbid sense of humor. There are a few of his famous cullonary cartoons, but most of the cartoons are previously unpublished rough drafts. This is definately a from the personal archives and not a best of book. My main gripe about this tome is that it only features 10 pages of odd-ball recipes. I was hoping for something a little meatier in depth."
1,Much ado about not much,I love Charles Addams and everything he has ever done. His wit and humor and insight are comparable to no one. The book was none of these and so I returned it. I will stick to anthologies of cartoons where I know I will be provoked and entertained.
4,A great book to have.,"If you are into cooking, the Addams Family or just all things possessed of a dark and slightly twisted sense of humor then this book is for you. You will love the cooking themed cartoons and the fact that the recipes (no matter how many oddly named) are indeed real recipes. The only fault that I can find is that there are fewer recipes than cartoons. Even so I would defiantly recommend this book to any home cook with a sense of humor."
3,Cooking,"Totally not what I thought. I was expecting more recipies, but as always the Addams cartoons are awsome. A few new ones were in the book that I'd never seen before."
5,Muy Divertido,"Es un muy buen libro, de facil lectura agradable y divertido, no querras dejar de leerlo hasta terminarlo."
3,"Story good, writing mediocre","I read the hard cover edition printed before the release of the DVD. The story is good and a very easy read if you are fluent in Spanish. I flows well and keeps your interest. It is very interesting from the historical point of view. I was not impressed with the writing abilities of the author, her vocabulary is very limited and keeps using the word ""coger"" over and over and over again. Looking forward to watch the movie."
1,Same problem - oil never got hot.,"I just received this fryer for Christmas and it does not work. When the light went off, indicating the oil was ready to cook, I put the food in and nothing happened. When I checked the temp with a thermometer, it barely registered 100. After waiting for an hour, it still did not get above 200. I will be returning this one and trying a different brand."
2,Nice fryer but....,Just pulled this fryher out of the box and hooked it up. forty minutes of frustration later I FINALLY got it to power up. Who's ever idea it was to put a magentic power cord on this thing needs to have his butt kicked.Seriously. I had to fiddle with the darn thing for 30 minutes -- the magnet wouldn't stick to plate and fell off every 10 seconds.Finally I had to wrap some black tape around the plug so it would stay in place via friction (you know -- the way 99% of all other appliance plugs work?I was tempted to box this up and return it but I think my solution will work long term.Not sure if I just got a weak magnet or if the whole thing is misaligned. I just don't see the point -- I guess if the fryer tips over the plug is supposed to pop lose. Okay. I get it.How 'bout just putting a trip switch like my electric heater?Sorry to vent. But if I had to do it over again I would choose a different model/brand based solely on the lame magnetic plug. Your mileage may vary.
4,Works as anticiapted,We have had this fryer for about 6 weeks now and have used it multiple times (mostly my husband). We have not experienced any problems with it and do not anticipate any although we haven't yet had to deal with changing the oil. I read the reviews for many different fryers before deciding on this one and am very pleased with it and the price.
4,works great,"it works great, you can cook a large amount of food fast. The oil heats up quickly. The only problem I had was the plug, since it is magnetic and doesn't push in and lock in. If you bump it, the magnetic connection breaks and no connection no power, and you may not realize it right away. Other than that it is great"
5,Very nice fryer,"Very satisfied with this fryer. We've done fries, chicken wings, and even made hush puppies and a few other things, and everything comes out great. The magnetic electrical plug is also very safety driven, but can easily be jostled out of position, so once you have it plugged in and warming up, don't try to move the cable."
1,This machine is crap!,"This product is the worst single electric appliance I have ever purchased and I got screwed with shipping fees.It does not hold termperature no matter how little food you are frying.The top constantly pops up whether cooking or just sitting on the counter. It takes a slamming of the top, several times to get closed.I tried contacting the seller to return it, but that is not an option, they will only replace it with another faulty appliance!My cost for shipping back to the seller is $15.00 and another $15 to ship a new machine to me!I ended up just throwing it away!Please do not purchase this product, it is a ripoff!"
5,Fryer,We bought this online because we couldn't find one in the stores that had a big basket. I love this one.
2,tiney maid for one,i can't get any thing crunchy every thing comes out like oven baked. except filled with grease. other reciews are wrong . the basket is tiney and if you fill to proper levels you can only fry small amounts. a chicken breast with bone doesn't even get submerged without the basket . with the basket the chicken breast don't even fit
1,Returned it for another brand,"Nice looking, and good idea for splatter free, but we could not get the power cord to stay on unless we held in in perfect position.It state there is a magnet to hold it in place, but it sure did not seem so.Too much agrevation trying to hold the cord.Cleaning it and sending it back."
2,Obviously emasculated by lawyers,"Seems nice but the safety nannies and lawyers have made this virtually unusable. The extremely short electric cord does not fit tightly, but is held on by a very weak magnet and loose electrical connection. Just moving this on your counter top is enough to break the connection and turn it off.A very poor solution.We didn't even bother to fill it with oil before we returned it."
5,Very good cooker,"Cooker was just as most reviews I have read. Very good for the money. Heats up pretty quick does not splatter. Does leave some smell of grease, so I cook outside in my garage. But will buy another if this one breaks."
5,Just what we wanted,Liked the look of the product. Although it's a little big for the counter. Very fast delivery. Fries beautifully!
2,Started out working well,"I don't know if this is typical for this product but I purchased mine in March 2010 and was initially very pleased with it. As in most of the other reviews, I agree that it comes apart and cleans easily. The lid doesn't have a seal on it like my other cooker did which causes a little mess of its own. It started out cooking the food well (typically I usually just cook french fries) but it began to progressively take longer and longer to heat up and to cook as well. The other night it didn't heat enough to cook anything (Even though the ready light came on). I typically used this about once a week but it just didn't hold up. I haven't found my paperwork yet to determine if it's still under warranty. It's a nice unit for the price but it should have a seal on the lid atleast. I imagine that it may have held up better if I didn't use it as much But that's why I bought it was to use it. I hope this information helps in your decision to by a deep fryer."
2,Doesn't hold the temperature,"I purchased this deep fryer based on numerous good reviews, unfortunately my fryer doesn't hold the selected temperature. The first time I used this it worked like a charm, made golden brown delicious french fries in 15 minutes, now after the 6th or 7th use it takes atleast 25+ minutes to cook the same batch of fries which come out extremely greasy. My fries lovin family even commented on the greasiness as they ate that last fry. I'm reluctant to use the fryer now because of the added grease in the food, it's bad enough eating deep fried food, but when it's really saturated with oil it just way too unhealthy!"
2,Two strikes and you're out,"I bought two of these. Unfortunately. The first one had a lid latch that was just misalligned enough that it would not catch the lid properly and would sometimes open on it's own. The thermostat quit in it after about a year. The second one, after about 3 months, would no longer come up to temp and would take forever to cook anything if at all.On the plus side they are easy to clean with the lift out pot."
1,The oil never got hot!!!,"I read the other reviews before purchasing this item and couldn't wait to get it. Well, the key word here is WAIT, because I waited over 1/2 hour for the oil to heat up and it never got hotter than 200 degrees. I reread the instructions and even tried 2 other electrical outlets, but no luck.I guess I got a ""lemon,"" so it's being shipped back."
5,Fun!,"Bought this as a gift for my 84-year old mother, who has always liked animals dressed up in clothes. Funny illustrations, cute ending!"
4,Very nice book for any child,"I really liked this book and bought it for my newphew, who is 4. I thought it was silly and somewhat unlike other books I had read. There are simple words or phrases that he can possibly learn to read. There are cute drawings in the book. It gets the imagination flowing."
5,Laughed out loud...,"My husband brought this book home from the library. I picked it up to read it to my 2-year-old, and could not stop laughing at the picture of the hen. If you have seen the book, you know what I mean. My son didn't think it was funny because he's too young, but I just know that someday he will love this book!"
2,Farewell to Manzanar,"The book I received is not the book shown which is what I thought I was ordering. I had a copy of this book many years ago and some how somewhere misplaced it. It was my sister's and I was trying to replace it for her. The cover shown is the one I had and the one I thought I would get. The cover on the one I received is not at all like the cover shown. Had I known I would not received the book shown, I would not have made the order. I am very disappointed, as I thought I would receive the book with the cover shown when I ordered it. I will still look for the book I thought I had ordered this time. I think this is a case of misrepresentation. If the seller did not have the book with this particular cover, it should not have been shown."
5,THE Handbook for Lovecraftians,"I have been recommending this book to people I know since I first encountered the first edition. This second edition is expanded and revised, and is even more helpful to Call of Cthulhu gamers, keepers, and especially writers of Mythos fiction. I've been using it as source material for my own odd little tales since I began writing them. And while it is true that the author has been known to frequent some of the same newsgroups that I do, he did not pay me to say these things. The book is extensively indexed and cross-referenced, with a very helpful timeline of the Cthulhu Mythos toward the back. It is clearly written, has doses of the author's dry sense of humor, especially in his choice of a quote for the preface page, is quite attractively packaged, and will look very nice on your bookshelf next to the many volumes of HP Lovecraft that you should have if you're reading this."
4,Vital Resource For All Investigators,"Having stumbled upon a copy of this book entirely by accident, I have since found Harm's work to be indispensible in my search for dread Cthulhu lore. With a simple A-Z format, the complier has recorded many useful references that are not confined to the Lovecraft canon of works (which are, of course, thinly veiled as fiction). The works of others with similar foresight and understanding are also used as sources. If Arkham University were ever to offer a paper in Cthulhu Investigation 101, this would certainly be on the required reading list."
4,Straight forward.,This little pink book lists many gods and creatures from the collective cthulhu mythos. All the major ones you already know will be listed as well as many you might not. It is a straightforward book. Do not expect any stories or pictures and you will be fine. It is a useful refrence tool and as long as that is what your looking for then this is perfect. Yup.
5,Massiah's Handbook,I had hoped since reading Illusions in June 1981 that the Messiah's Handbook would be published. It is excellent and worth waiting for.Thank You. F K Jones
2,Offbeat Handbook,"It is a mistake to think of this Handbook as a novel, or short story. It is actually a book of common one line, philisophical quips. It doen't really guide you at all. It is like having a positive fortune cookie you can open on a daily (or a more frequent) basis."
5,My Favorite Book....,"This is an absolutely wonderful little book, I can't rave enough about it. It collects a lot of the passages, maxims, quotes from many of Richard Bach's books. If you've read 'Illusions: Adventures Of A Reluctant Messiah', then you are already familiar with the title as this is the book in that story. I only wish there were more of Richard Bach's excerpts/quotes in this - perhaps he will issue a revised edition someday? One can only hope. Meanwhile, this edition is hard to find and out of print, so I highly recommend picking up a copy if you can find one. I was lucky enough to get hold of an autographed copy- the prize of my book collection."
5,Richard Bach is a GOD - or in this case - Messiah,"This is the companion book to 'Illusions - The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah'. It is the guide book, so to speak, of how to BE a Messiah. Just a small pocket-sized edition, you can follow the directions and see if you get the answers that you seek, but beware, you might get the answers you seek and they may all be wrong? Read Illusions first, then try a little work with this companion tome and you'll be greatly surprised how life looks when you look thru the eyes of Mr. Bach."
5,Wonderful words of wisdom from a master scribe,"I always find words of wisdom and inspiration in Richard Bach's book. In the pocket-sized Messiah's Handbook, Bach gathers many of his most profound and thought-provoking statements in one place. A must have for those who need a daily dose of motivation. I've read it so many times now, I've lost count. I carry it with me, opening it each day and finding just the right morsel of inspiration, advice or wisdom, and I've downloaded it to my Kindle."
1,Whoa!,"After reading the book Illusions, I expected so much more of the Handbook. What I expected was something fresh and poignant-what I got was unenlightened."
5,"Inspiring, Fascinating","Over the years I have admired and ejoyed Richard Bach's works. This one came as a welcome surprise, as its content honors the ""Reminders for the Advanced Soul"" part of the title. It is a nice compendium of quotes by Bach that reflect his philosophy of life. The text speaks to the reader's Higher Self and invites to perform self-enquiry. I personally find it nourishes my spirit. And I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys inspirational quotes of a different kind."
5,HIGH QUALITY! FABULOUS LOOK!,What can I say! My husband was EXTREMELY impressed by the craftsmanship that was done by hand. He was so shocked that I actually found a place that had these. Took me days...........but I found them!Would HIGHLY recommend!!
1,No Way... Zero stars.,I wouldn't buy this CD if it was on sale for 1 cent. How can a voice like that hold your attention. I'd pass on this one.
3,It served the purpose.,I gifted this dart board to my nephews and they were pretty happy with the gift. I wish I could have seen them playing and analyse accordingly.
4,Very nice dartboard,"Okay, you're not going to find this dartboard on the wall of some pub in the U.K. but it is good looking and works well without your having to worry about gouging holes in your wall or impaling a curious pet. The dartboard comes compactly rolled up in a nice dark cardboard tube that is meant for re-use so you can take the board and darts around with you. The darts themselves are toy-like but they seem durable and have those very strong ceramic magnets on their tips so they usually stay exactly where you threw them on the dartboard.I would definitely buy a set or two of spare darts if youngsters will be playing with this dartboard because the darts are very small and the kids will be throwing these super magnetic things at the refrigerator, your car, hanging cookware etc. This is a great little product, I am very happy with it."
3,"With retrospect, even this needs a balanced view","The Pentagon's Soviet Military Power annual reviews always made for fascinating reading. But it was evident that these documents were pretty biased, even to teenager with a strong interest in military technology. So Tom Gervasi's document was equally fascinating, pointing out where the Pentagon had shorted our own technology to further inflate the Soviet threat. But even a very quick read of Gervasi's text will show his inherent bias. Such gems as indicating that the then emerging Mig-29 ""[paraphrased] isn't anywhere as capable as our F-15 and F-16s."" Well, clearly the Mig-29 was indeed the equal to our front line fighters (and there are other quotes that have caught my eye), thus even the author needs to be taken with a similar grain of salt at times."
3,O.K.,"A good introdution to the band for neo-garbage fans. It got facts, but no theme or styleistic prose (like you really care. Anyway it's a bio, so you can let that slide). On the plus side it got pictures of Shirley, thats always gotta be good."
4,"Cool, simple info book","I wouldn't go so far to say this is a biography... it's not indept enough. But it does offer enough information to sasitify your basic intrests about Garbage, and it's members. It reads like a magizine, but has a little more info, and a lot of cool pictures.It is out of print at the moment, but if you can get a used copy, and you are a garbage fan, I would if i were you. This is pretty much the only bio for one of the coolest bands out there at this time."
3,Fair,"ER doc Jeff Wincott is sick and tired of all the drug and violence patients he's had to patch up over the years and after getting gunned down and nearly killed himself decides to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Lots of amazing violence occurs and there's a cool scene where Wincott shows what he can do with a set of Miracle Blades and a kitchen table. Okay mostly, but also can be draggy at times."
3,confusion,"Corman's marketing people messed up and exchanged info on this film with info on Jack London's THE SEA WOLF. Sorry for the confusion. Could Amazon straighten this out, please?"
2,I opened a can of.......,"Of course, when it's Mr. Bean, you don't expect depth of any sort. This is a good selection if you want to rest your thinking skills. No depth....just mindless comedy (which is okay when you just want to laugh)."
4,"Mr Bean is perfect, the DVDs not quite","While I'm sure this DVD set is incredible, and it most definitely will beat the only current existing Mr. Bean related DVDs, which include ""The Best of Mr. Bean,"" a funny, if not cheap ""best of"" reel where Mr. Bean simply reminisces about classic bits, and the Bean: The Movie DVD, a movie which I liked very much, but was sort of a rehashed film, and the DVD was sparse. The VHS including deleted scenes is better. Anyway, this DVD set is great for including the documentary and the other bits and pieces, but nonetheless must lose major points for not including a Rowan Atkinson commentary on the episodes! Grr! What a mistake! I'll still buy it, though, and you can't beat Bean when it comes to laughs."
3,Mr Bean is NOT a BBC production,The only time Mr Bean was shown on the BBC was during Comic Relief. It was always an ITV show.
1,Mr. Bean - The Whole Bean (Complete Set),"the product never I arrive, him requeri the information about the shipment but never me they provided it, so the salary bought in amazon was a bad experience, thus I recommend not to buy in this site."
1,"My DVD was defective! I can't hear any of Mr Beans vocals. Plus, he wasnt THAT funny.","Howz is going ladies and gentz? I love Comedy probably more than anyone I know and I know the difference between lame wannabez like Mr Bean and Robin Williams versus GOOD talented guys like Pauly Shore, Bob Saggot, and Carrot Top. First of all, my DVD came defective because MR Bean appears to be talking but I don't hear any vocals! Its like hes mumblings.. There was no real funny jokes either , you know, like the ones Pauly Shore used in EVERY single movie of his! And Mr. Bean episodes didn't even have any funny themes like being stuck in a Bio-Dome for a year, no Cameo appearances as a Cokehead, no jury duty or joining the army scenes!, and why didn't have have a cool nickname like Weasel!?MR. Bean needs to take a few lessons from the master of comedy Pauly Shore and Bob Saggot, otherwise nobody will buy this Australian comedy garbage! For good quality comedy, stick with Hollywood stars Bob Saggot and Pauly Shore."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS!,I needed this to begin the school year as I teach in a new high school. To date I still have not received the product -
4,Frank about Bean,Childlike Bean hits the spot.Rowan Atkinson is truly wonderful. No better physical comedian since Red Skelton.
5,So funny!!,Great purchase if you love mr. Bean!! Includes all 14 episodes and extras that are very interesting. My family and I love it.
4,"Give it a chance, you may be surprised!","The first time I saw Mr. Bean, I was over at my uncle's house. He had PBS on and was telling my Dad and me about this show that was coming on. We watched that first episode and I didn't get it. I thought it was dumb. My uncle and Dad were laughing, but I wasn't. Flash forward a few weeks and as I was flipping through the channels, I saw Mr Bean was on. I stopped for a minute to see ""that dumb show"". A few minutes into the episode, I found myself smiling and even beginning to snicker a little. I had begun to enjoy Mr Bean.I caught a few more episodes and ended up buying this box set. It is great! You may have to give it an episode or two, but you will be pleasantly surprised! My favorite parts of this box set are the 2 never aired episodes as well as ""The Story of Bean"", which is a 40 minute documentary on Mr Bean."
3,The over laughing of the audience track ruins it for me.,"The most distracting thing about this dvd set is the audience over-laughter on every single little thing Bean does. It becomes highly annoying. Every thing Bean does results in almost a standing ovation from the audience. You can hear this audience coughing, breathing, and waiting on his every move to burst out in the loudest laughter over things that should NOT be funny. Mr. Bean is very funny to me but everything is funny to this audience. There's not more than a few seconds between roaring laughter. The volume of the audience is also so loud that it dominates each show and becomes the focal point. Each show is out on location somewhere and not filmed in a studio so this laugh track must have been inserted over each show. I would much rather see Bean the movie where I can enjoy watching him in peace. The audience over-laughter ruins the tv show for me."
5,Mr. Bean - The Whole Bean (Complete Set),Classic Mr. Bean. Short episodes are extremely funny. My six year old child laughed until she ran out of breath!
5,Love that Bean,"Enjoyed the genuine humor Mr. Bean provides. Kids loved it as well as I.If you love the silly English humor, it's a ""must have""."
2,"""Bean"" there, done that...","Manages to beat a few chuckles out of you... but really can't make you laugh after repeat viewings. The silly sketches are just not clever enough to keep my interest for too long.Rowan is a genius, though."
4,Great but NOT the Whole Bean!!!,"Bean is great and enjoyable but please note that these are not the complete episodes as you may have seen them on PBS or HBO. The Christmas episode and the ""Do It Yourself, Mr. Bean Episodes have scenes missing.It's a great collection for Bean fans but not uncut.According to A&E; these are the versions that Rowan Atkinson's representatives wanted released so there is no plan for a fix."
3,Bean - Not Uncut!,"Mr. Bean is a wonderful series from ITV in Britain. When I purchased the DVD set I just assumed it was complete. WRONG! At least two major segments have been sliced out (as has been mentioned earlier). While the shows are still hilarious, whoever trimmed these shows needs trimming themselves."
3,MISSING SCENES,"I love Mr. Bean, but how could the editors have cut the classic ""weighing the turkey"" and ""trying out the easy chair"" scenes? There are other cut scenes. What on earth is the justification?"
2,"Love Bean, Dislike Editing and Cutting","I love Mr. Bean! I was about to order the DVD set when I read the reviews about the cutting-out of scenes. It is not a complete set when the episodes are not complete! It should be illegal to tamper with the original works of the editors and producers of a show...kinda like cutting the hair of the Mona Lisa. Their names are attached to their work, which becomes someone else's work when tampered with...a shame."
4,dumb but hilarious,"he's so dumb i get annoyed and leave the room while i'm watching, but my daughter belly laughs the whole time. it's worth seeing what he'll do next"
4,A Practical Side to Mr. Bean,"Mr. Bean is clever entertainment. Some vignettes drag. Others are a scream! A little of Mr. Bean goes a long way. I prescribe his antics in multiple sittings. As much as I appreciate the humor, watching the entire collection as a Mr. Bean-a-thon may border on torture.On a practical note, ""The Heart Attack"" skit in ""Mr. Bean Rides Again"" was incredibly effective in our company's safety meeting to communicate the potential outcomes of ignorance in a cardiac emergency. It awakened interest in proper CPR techniques.The Complete Mr. Bean is entertaining diversion and handy to have when the normal TV lineup strikes one as seriously uninteresting."
3,disappointing,I have seen the original episodes and am very disappointed with the missing scenes as others. If not for the missing scenes it would have received 5 stars.Someone who has not seen the original episodes will love this collection.
5,Bean there,"Mr Bean is one of the best Dvd that i own, if you want to die laughing this is the dvd for you"
3,Mr. Bean is funny but repetitive,"I had seen Mr. Bean a couple of times on TV and I found him very funny, but now that I have seen all his episodes, I consider that some of them are predictable or repetitive.I recommend this DVD set for someone who wants to enjoy TV without great expectations"
2,Mr Bean - The Whole Bean (complete set) VHS,"I was very disapointed re. the above. It was my fault I ordered a VHS instead a DVD. I didnt know VHS were still being sold. I typed in my country, Australia. But the VHS Mr Bean was sent in American format.I was refunded half the cost of above less postage.I really cant rate it truthfully,as I didnt see it!Apart from this last order, I have been very happy with Amazon."
3,Bean Lite,"I bought this set because I had rented the Mr. Bean tapes and loved them. However, for reasons entirely beyond my scope of imagination, A&E decided to cut scenes out of this DVD set. I know this, because one of the bits they snipped out happened to be one of my favorite sketches! I was very disappointed, and I felt the the title ""The Whole Bean"" was extremely misleading. So beware! This is more like ""Bean Lite"" than the ""Whole Bean""!"
2,I thought this was the WHOLE Bean!,"This DVD set is dissapointing because it has several edits made to it, Mr Bean is a tv show that needs every last second of each episiode.Luckily i have found another version from Austrailia with no edits www.devoteddvd.com.au is the web site i found it on, it does not have as many special features but its still the real whole bean!"
1,Mr. Bean - The Whole Bean (Complete Set),I've just received an e-mail from the producers of Mr Bean (Tiger Aspect)and it states that their will be a PAL version of the FULL TV series to be released on DVD/VHS in Autumn.
5,Hilarious British Humor,"Can't get enough of this one, either. What an odd little creature. Good condition, prompt delivery. Thanks."
2,Wait for the uncut version,"Just to add to the chorus of other terribly disappointed U.S. Bean fans, there's nothing ""complete"" about this set -- at least for those of us in America who originally watched the series on PBS.The excuse given by the show's producers for not including this ""extra footage"" in A&E;'s box set is beyond ridiculous. As if British viewers would have minded seeing this footage for the first time???"
3,What is with the editing?,"I love Mr. Bean and have watched every episode several times. I bought the videos ages ago and was thrilled with the idea of a DVD collection, since one of the videos I own is edited. But you know what, the DVD seems even worse. If I wanted to see the edited Mr. Bean I'd watch it on TV along with all the commercials. But I don't. Simply put, if you don't know Mr. Bean you will love this DVD, but if you know him by heart, this collection is going to tick you off."
4,Good Laughs,"If you love Mr. Bean the movie, you might enjoy this DVD set as well.Many of the scenes ideas from the movie came from the tv series. It is worth buying, if you have never seen any of the series before. The series give you good laughs for Bean's stupidity. I suggest you get this. Some of them may make you laugh so hard that peed in your pants.If you have seen some / all of the series before, it might not be as worthy because some of them were edited out. Although some had been edited, it is still a good collection to keep. Don't forget that there're bonus features of the never before released in US mini-series."
1,This book makes Shamanism a religion.,"Native Healer is really not worth the money spent on it. I threw my copy away rather than be responsible for another person having spent their money on it.My biggest complaint is the attack on menstruating women. ""Unclean"" because their bodies are eliminating ""toxins"".Their bodies are eliminating blood, the force of life, that was being prepared to nurture the birth of a new human being. Blood that needs to be kept fresh.This book turns Shamanism into a religion, rather than a free-form spiritual practice as it so richly deserves."
5,SOOTHING,THIS IS THE SOOTHING MUSIC OF THE PIPES I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO. GREAT FOR RELAXING AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WATCHING THE SUN SET.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,"I repeat, do NOT buy this CD! The recording is not an actual person playing a bagpipe. It is an electronic recreation, probably played in a computer. Amazon's rating system forced me to give it at least one star--If I could've I would've given it negative 5!I have been piping for over 20 years, and I've never heard such crap! I have no financial stake in having you not buy this cd, I just want you to have an authentic bagpipe. I've contacted Amazon to tell them it's a bogus product, and to have it removed from their inventory, but they do not respond. Buy something by Alasdair Gillies, Willie McCallum, Roddy MacLeod, Jack Lee, Bill Livingstone, Michael Grey, Bruce Gandy, or John Cairns instead."
1,Awful,"I've only listened to the Amazon.com-provided samples. Holy crap! The sound is so awful; I could barely get through even the short samples (and I'm not even a piper [...yet.] How on earth does this CD get so many rave reviews? I can only guess that the 5-star reviews are shill reviews.As for the ""performances,"" the individual bagpipe notes seem to be authentic sample recordings, much akin to piano notes sampled for keys on a digital piano. Simply feed/play the proper notes and you'll have an authentic-sounding bagpipe, right? WRONG! Since the bagpipe chanter is monophonic, mimicking bagpipes in this manner does not work the same as a digital piano.These reproductions are just too artificial-sounding."
1,Are They Kidding?!,"Just going by the song samples of this crappily electronically recreated sound of bagpipes crap, I implore you to not buy this. Listen to other recordings of the real thing. Try the Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, for instance. That'll bring your blood up instead of making you cringe. Beware of this guys other stuff too, I'm thinkin'."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This recording of Funeral Tunes is absolutely the worst I have ever listened to! I am so sorry I purchased it. Since I love the bagpipes, I can honestly tell you I would hate the bagpipes if this is what I had to judge them on! It HURTS my ears!"
4,Funeral Bagpipes,"Purchased this CD looking for funeral music to play during military funerals for the Patriot Guard Riders. Music was satisfactory altho the selections are rather short, however, the duration doesn't make a difference to me since they are recorded on an MP3 player that I use on the motorcycle and can be played over and over."
5,Mira,I first heard Mira one morning pouring out of my car stereo on the way to work. The angelic voice of Regina cuts like a knife threw the air and pierces your soul. The ethereal music of the band supporting her haunting voice makes for a captivating experience. This is one of the best new groups I've heard in eons. If you like music from the heavens you need to listen to Mira.
5,wonderful cd,"i found this little gem the other day in a used cd bin and i felt like i had literally struck gold. finally we have a goth cd which isn't so....goth and that's a contradiction in terms. for all those who can't seem to get enough of old cocteau twins albums or mazzy star will relish after hearing regina sosinksky's beautiful yet haunting vocals on this fantastic album. unfortunately, i have no specific tracks at this time to recommend but i hardly think this one will disappoint any goth fans or music lovers who can appreciate a lovely female voice time and time again. i will definately purchase their other cd entitled apart sometime in the near future. i also recommend tanya donnelly's cd beautysleep which i can't stop playing in addition to the mira cd. happy listening !!!"
5,Hypnotic,I discovered Mira by chance. I happened to be in a record store when I heard what was playing over the store speakers. It was like being struck by lightning. I was automatically drawn in by the vocals and guitar work. It was hypnotic! I stood there and listened to 2 or 3 songs and loved every one of them. This was the music loved. Very Cure like. Regina's vocals are so captivating and enchanting. The guitar work is so haunting. The music works as a whole. Not flashy or abrasive. I love music that carries with vocals that makes makes you feel. I've had this cd for 5 months or so and I still listen to it regularly! It's not for everyone but for those who enjoy music that makes you feel then Mira is a passionate choice.
3,Wish washy,"I enjoyed Apart, there for I came back for more with Mira's first release. I wasn'tsurprised to hear the same stuff. Very wish washy after a while and no songs reallystick out. The vocals are unique but nothing amazing. Actually Regina seems almostnervous to let her voice really fly. She has definitely come along way with the secondrelease but still there's something missing. I do enjoy Mira's music and will checkthem out at Projekt Fest but I am a little disappointed with reviews that first got me topick them up. I feel hoaxed."
4,aural issues,"Competent moody rock music. But if I wasn't so fond of Regina's vocals, I might not keep the album because of my disappointment with the engineering of it. Perhaps when Projekt picked them up, they received a small production budget, or perhaps the engineer is just uninspired. The bottom line is a linearity throughout the disc that grows wearisome despite Mira's playing and composing talents."
3,"Cheap, Effective Sedative","The music is a great sedative - perfect treatment for insomniacs (assuming you have a CD player). The music is repetitive, & the lead singer has a pleasant, haunting voice (although somewhat familiar & predictable). I will be using this CD approximately 1 time every 3 months for backgroung music while cleaning or sleep medication. I don't mean to sound negative, because I actually liked the ""CD sound"" enough to rate it 3 stars. A must buy for those wanting uncommon, relaxing music."
2,Half of them work,"I ordered two of these for my mac mini because they were the cheapest I could find, $90. One out of the two was defective so I sent one back. They sent me back two replacements and one out of these two was defective. I think the reason they sent me two replacements is because they know that only half the chips work.If you're willing to hasle with returns and the difficuly of opening the mini this chip might be worth it. Maybe you should order twice as many as you need and return the defects."
5,Riding the streets with no music sucks.,"This is one of Wesley Willis' earliest albums. The songs have the same basic song structure as all his other songs. But the songs have different subject matters than his later songs. For example, most of his later albums have several songs describing concerts he attended. This album doesn't have any songs like that. Most of these songs are based on fantasies out of Wesley's imagination. Wesley describes getting attacked by electric eels, vampires, dragons, Batman and more. To be honest, some of these songs don't make a heck of a lot of sense, even by Wesley's standards. But that is part of their appeal. This is probably Wesley's best album, not counting ""Greatest Hits"" albums."
5,Return to Thundera!,"I was five when the original ThunderCats series aired. I remember sitting directly in front of the TV and eagerly watched each exciting episode. The sets were expensive when they first came out, but I waited a few years until they were about twenty dollars each!The episodes in Season Two Volume Two are:Disc 7:Exile IsleKey to ThunderaReturn of the ThunderCubsThe FormulaLocket of LiesBracelet of PowerDisc 8:The Wild WorkoutThe ThuderscopeThe Jade DragonThe Circus TrainThe Last DayDisc 9:Return to Thundera, Part 1Return to Thundera, Part 2Return to Thundera, Part 3Return to Thundera, Part 4Return to Thundera, Part 5Disc 10:LeahFrogmanThe HeritageScrewlooseMalcarHelpless LaughterDisc 11:Cracker's RevengeThe Mossland MonsterMa-Mutt's ConfusionThe ShadowmasterSwan SongThe Touch of AmortusDisc 12:The Zaxx FactorWell of DoubtThe Book of Omens"
2,I do like it,"I just think that people who put in the box did not care about the fact that one disc inside was off the placement thing and it was dancing around inside putting in jeopardy the quality and integrity of the same. I feel like they just noticed it, did not care and send it...really sad about it. I did not feel appreciated as a customer"
5,"Holy crap, I love this show!","Okay, so the box art pales in comparison to He-Man, but this series is so much better. And we all hate how they price gouged us by breaking it up into volumes instead of complete seasons, but again, this show is worth it. This is the best cartoon of the 80's in my opinion and I was blown away by how well it still holds up today. Such a fantastic cartoon!"
1,should have lerned by now,I already had made the mistake of buying the other Rockabilly release from this conpany on dvd this ones almost as bad. NIX TO THISAl Watts
5,pleased as can be about finding this product,"I have a shop here in Asheville, nc that carries Eminence but does not always have the product that I'm interested in. I am confident in purchasing through Amazon and finding a source that carries a more complete line."
3,Birds didn't like it,"I gave these egg sticks to my cockatiel and canary, and neither liked them, particularly. I wouldn't order these again."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,"It is beautiful and timeless. Honestly, their first single off their last album ""Can't Hurry Love"" would kind of get on my nerves when it would come on Sirius...but not this cd. I can listen to it over and over all the way through. I bought it at the same time I got the new Cardigans ""Super Extra Gravity"", and while I love that cd, I think I love this one even more! If you like the Cardigans, Emiliana Torrini, or Fluke, you will probably love this one (maybe even more). Get it now. What are you waiting for?"
3,Pros and Cons,"An acquaintance recommended this product to me for hot flashes because she swore by it. It did not work for my hot flashes, however, I did find that I was able to think better and had more ""joy."" I had to stop taking it all together because it seemed to be causing a lot of foot pain. I'm not sure what that was all about, but whatever there is in certain products for hot flashes seems to give me terrible foot pain."
5,Beauty in a card,"This series of cards is beautiful. High quality in the way they are made, makes them appear to be real stained glass. By touching you know the difference, but by look you cannot. Rich colors, detail, flow & movement, & with a light behind the card, more details pop out in the stained glass appearance, just like the real thing.These cards are more than worth the price."
2,not as good as I remembered it,"I rented this movie years ago and had some kind of nostalgic memory of how good it was. I finally bought it but was disappointed. There isnt that much action, though I still like the fight scene at the end. Its kind of awwsome how Norris keeps pounding on ""the terror"" but he keeps coming after him. I guess you could say there is some good character development in the character Norris plays."
4,chuck beats the bad guy and even acts in this slick little thriller,"as a cop who still has nightmares about a killer he caught 3 years earlier,mr. norris shows he does have some acting talent and makes the most out of this little thriller,and that takes this one a notch or two above most of his movies. the killer has gotten free and while awaiting the birth of his child,chuck must track and catch the terror(the killers nickname)! better than you think!! check it out!"
1,video is a joke,"this is a joke,,all it does is what a documentary shows u. not anything on the year,,just on the history of the team...DONT BUY!!!"
3,Essential Chuck Norris Viewing,"""Hero"" Chuck Norris plays a police officer named Danny O'Brian who is haunted by his past run in with serial killer Simon Moon (The Terror). (...). There is a side story involving O'Brian's relationship with his ex-therapist. This tends to slow the movie in spots. As Chuck Norris fans we want to keep the action pace high. Hero and the Terror is one of my favorite Chuck Norris movies though it has less martial arts and more suspense and story than you may expect from one of his movies. The quality of the DVD is very good. It contains both the widescreen and standard screen format with virtually no extras. That's OK considering the budget price of this MGM release. Hero and the Terror is an essential addition to a Chuck Norris movie library. Recommended viewing."
4,Hero faces his ultimate Terror.,"Chuck Norris plays Danny O'Brien, a police officer emotionally troubled by his run in with a fierce hulk of a psychopath named Simon Moon (played by Jack - Superman 2 - Halloran). When Moon escapes from a mental institution O'Brien must again face his deepest terror. Norris, as always, makes for a likable hero and director William Tannen pulls off some nice suspense sequences. This is arguably the best movie Norris made for the Cannon Group and is an essential in any fan's Chuck Norris collection."
3,Fair Norris Movie,"Hero And The Terror is a decent Chuck Norris movie. Many of his better films involved him being a cop, such as An Eye For An Eye and Code of Silence. This film is not as good as either one of those films, but it is still a fairly entertaining film.Norris plays an LA cop who must go after a notorious serial killer after the killer ecapes from jail. Norris' life is already complicated because his fiance is pressuring him to marry her.The climax in a old movie theater is good and entertaining, but the rest of the movie is only so-so. Hero and The Terror is not Norris' best, but it's not his worst, either."
5,"Delightful, lyrical, intimate","Ruth is a beautiful piece of music. So glad it was recorded, and sure would love to see it performed someday. Seems it would be perfect for a college group, given the modest resources needed. The music is clearly of the 20th Century, but isn't obscure and professorial. It is in the tradition of what I guess people would call 20th Century neo-romanticism. I am no musicologist, just a consumer of opera, a fan if you will. I particularly like British composers (Bax, Arnold, Rubbra, and Tippett, among others) and it was searching for others of that ilk that I happened upon Ruth. It is hard me to imagine any opera lover not finding this to be a gem. As I put in my title, the words that come to mind are lyrical and intimate. This is a moving story - hence its endurance over the centuries, and Berkeley has captured the emotions and drama well."
1,The ideas are not so great,"If you like tradional style kitchens, then this may be useful to you. Otherwise, I suggest you skip it. The tips are not very informative and the pictures are so-so. Better books are Better Homes and Gardens: Complete Kitchens and the Kitchen Planner (this one especially if you are remodeling your home)."
5,Excellent Breton folk-rock,"This is my first exposure to Tri Yann, so I can't say how this album compares to their others. However, I can say that this one consists of some excellent and thoroughly enjoyable Breton folk-rock. When I say 'folk-rock', by the way, I mean that in the British sense, rather than the American sense. Bands like Steeleye Span, Fairport Convention, Pentangle, etc. are apt points of comparison, although the band's Breton influences alsos invite comparisons to Alan Stivell, Gwerz, and Gwendal. Excellent stuff and highly recommended."
5,"Remington True Jr & T-10 Combo Pack, Earmuffs & Safety Glasses, Kid Size",My grandson just loved this package. Uses it frequently. I am glad he is protecting himself. Fits him to a tee unlike other glasses.
1,Terrible product - I threw mine out,"I have some old Joyce Chen bamboo products - they are beautiful pieces of bamboo wood with a natural smooth surface and a pleasant touch to the wood. You can feel the quality and you want to hold it in your hand.I don't know what happened to the Joyce Chen line, but the new bamboo products are terrible. They are from inferior bamboo with impossible to remove labels stuck tenaciously to the back of the bowl of the spoon.But that isn't the worst problem - which is that the cheap bamboo is covered with a nasty pale yellow shellac or varnish, unevenly applied and unevenly adhering to the wood. Who knows what that is made out of (it's made in China) but I don't want it near any of my food, and I can't stand the feel of it in my hand. If I scratch it with my fingernail it flakes off - yuck.This isn't the nice piece of bamboo that helps me in the kitchen - it is a cheap varnished piece of wood (albeit bamboo) that goes straight in the garbage."
2,Horrible Horrible Horrible.....,"This game is absolutely boring. The reason why I gave it two stars overall is because there is so many bugs and glitches, and long loading times. The graphics are pretty good but you don't get to choose who you want to be. Also, why is this only two players????? It's called fantastic four not fantastic two. Also, for some reason this game always gives me a huge headace when playing the game. I tried giving it a chance but I gave up. PLEASE don't waste your money on this crappy game."
1,FANTASTIC...FaNtAsY?,"You are on the final level of the game. You have mummies, dogs, dinoaurs, and Dr. Doom all hitting you, leaving no space to move a finger. You try jumping but they just keep attacking you. You have 50% health left, and the puzzle is only one fourths of thw way done. A mummy attacks you with his light saber. ""Game Over"". That is all I could remember while playing this game. I think that this is one of those one button games. I used the square button more than I used the joysticks. This game is good for those who have little ones, but not for over the age of 13. Rental suggested, buying not reccomended."
2,Don't believe the hype,"This is not a great game, it's not a good game, it's mediocre.It is repetitive (to the nth degree), hard to understand what is required of the gamer, and the camera angles are hard to work with at times.I spent too much money on this game, I read the first and only Amazon review and went out and bought it new. The previous reviewer is either an idiot or he's making money somehow.Don't buy the game, rent it first and save some dough."
1,-,"The graphics seem dated and rushed. The gameplay was laborious and after 30 minutes I simply could not play anymore as it seemed I was wasting my time. I was playing with two player option, but the second player wound up always having to be a robot. The second stage was having each character escape from the hospital and fight off robots and solve puzzles to open doors; I don't rememeber any of that in the movie. I would not recommend."
1,BLAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There are many, many things (oh, where to start) that make this game horrible. First, (hmmmm, I have to collect my thoughts) this entire game is button mashing. You can beat the game just hitting square, square, square. Except for the boring little mini-games where you just hit, and Im not joking here, X as fast as you can.People praise the fact that you can switch between two characters, but I never saw a need for this, unless I needed one character to do one of those stupid pointless puzzles. But really I would just switch between characters because I got tired of using the Thing and wanted to use Mr. Fantastic.The graphics are incredibly horrible and choppy. The game is an eyesore. Please, please, please dont buy this game. Its for your own good."
2,Not all that fantastic...,"i think the game isnt all that....it's like xmen legends, but doesnt hold, you know? it didnt have what it really took to be fun, unlike xmen legends which kicked hiney..cant wait for the second one to come out...but for this game, i think its better to rent it than to buy it outright...you might wanna spend a whole lot on a game that u absolutley hate...lolgod bless john kerry, you shoulda been prez..."
4,Did the job,"I was looking for valve boxes for my home irrigation system and these were the only ones I could find that we're deep enough to do the job and strong enough to hold up. I wish there was more flexibility in creating access holes, I.e. punch outs. I had to drill holes in the sides for pipe access. Otherwise, the orbit box was right for the job."
4,Rachid Taha's debut,"This is Rachid Taha first solo album after breaking up from his band Carte de sejour (Green Card). It is not as explosive as his later works (Ole Ole, Made in Medina),nevertheless, its an exellent album with great music, i am suprised i am the first one to commit on it. Maybe because Taha's earlier albums are hard to find...In the mean time, go and buy this album and you wouldnt be disappointed."
5,Slush Inhaler,"I have used the slush inhaler with either an 8 inch ice fishing hole or a 10 inch ice fishing hole. I found it to work great to quickly remove the slush from the hole. Just insert the device into the hole, close the baffle and pull up. You get all of the slush without the water. A second insertion gets the left overs. It leaves a minimal amount for you to pick up with the ice scoop and you're fishing in a hurry.Clarence M.Monticello, MN"
1,Dead on Arrival,"Non-functional right out of the package (which took a couple of weeks to reach me). I'd previously tried an Andrea Electronics NC-181 Over the Head Headset which worked pretty well (except for getting the microphone position adjusted so listeners didn't hear my breathing) but I was looking for a less expensive option. You get what you pay for. I'll be returning these to Amazon. And, if I need this functionality again, I'll stick with a well-rated headset."
1,"Did not work, thin wires, small connectors","Plugged my 2.5mm headset into one end and the pink into my laptop's mic in and green into laptop's headphones input. DID NOT WORK EITHER FOR MIC OR HEADPHONES. After reviewing laptop settings, etc. finally happened to plug the green (which is headphones) into the mic input and the mic now worked! Only problem is that the pink into headphones did not give me sound. So, it's miss-wired or just screwed up. I am returning it today.Also note that compared to the new one I bought (here on Amazon, see my other review), the wires in this adapter are very thin and the connectors small."
3,I can't remember...,I can't remember when the hell I purchased this. It must have been in 2008 or so but I don't have the item anymore. I do remember it worked for what I needed to do though.
2,Mono operation with Secret Service Throat Mic.,"I assumed that the term Mobile meant radio and not cellular technology. I was able to confirm the loopback presented when the ring and tip3(of 3) are shorted, a poor design indeed.In any case the pins for io/out on this and likely other devices meant to work with radios, like Visar Series and TalkAbout, are reversed... perhaps to avoid this problem?Some comments above indicate this is mono, I can't confirm or deny that.Here are some links I found helpfull:[...]This /may/ match the expected input of this adapter:[...]These are the same and NOT like this adapter:[...][...][...]"
1,This thing does'nt work at all,The 2.5 mobile to headset that i purchased does not work at all. I tell you guys don't buy this product. I am very dissapointed plus I paid more than $7 for shipping which is more expensive than the product and what did I got nothing not even a refund and a RNA to ship it back for free. I contacted the seller and I was told that they will refund it but I will pay for the shiiping back to them. Do not buy this product!!!!!
5,Worked fine for using a 360 headset on my PC,I use this to connect a 360 headset (one of the motorola nfl ones) to my PC for voip use. I use it with both google voice and skype no problems.no static or anything like that introduced with this adapter.works fine.
4,"Cheap, Easy and Useful","I had a hard time finding this item, but it works well and allows me to use my cell and cordless phone headset(s) with my notebook and PDA. Simplification is a good thing."
1,Garbage,Not only did it take almost a month for me to get this cord when I got it it's flimsy really crappy Gives the worst sound I've ever heard going to order the real one off of turtle Beach.com I'm pretty sure if I bought a cord from the dollar store it would've sounded better than this one
1,I wish it worked properly...,"I got this because my Plantronics headset attaches to my Lenovo T60P (Windows 7) via USB, and I only have three USB ports. I figured this would free up a port, but it did not.The item is fine, looks to be intact, and no damage to it. Unfortunately, it doesn't provide any microphone capabilities. I can hear everything through the headset, but the microphone does not function whatsoever.I'm really disappointed that it did not work, but then again, the item was cheap as hell with free shipping, so I guess, ""no harm no foul.""If anyone knows how to get the microphone to work properly, please let me know. My reviewer name AT gmail DOT com.Thanks!"
1,I waited 3 weeks to throw $2 in the trash,"Why this is the only place I've ever seen such an adapter, I don't know. Like most, the mic half of this just wont work. I bought it to use a standard Xbox 360 headset with my computer."
4,works well,"good product, better price - shipped fast. I misunderstood the description, however it works just as advertised and I am very pleased"
3,Decent Product,The product works as intended but gives off static/white noise in speakers or headsets when the mic is plugged in.
5,5 stars love it,My adapter arrived on time and the price was right. I have a headset for using ventrilo for mmorpgs and this converter works without a problem.
5,headset to pc converter,This product works as described. Very pleased. We use it almost every day with Google Talk and and a regular 2.5mm cell phone earpiece.
4,2.5mm Mobile Headset To PC Converter,This item allowed me to use my Plantronics cell phone head set on my desktop with Skype. Just plugged everything in I was up and running. Perfect solution to finding a headset for the desktop. The price also made it the most economical solution. Very pleased!
4,Does the job for online PC gaming,"I was looking for something that would allow me to use the mobile phone headsets I already own for online gaming. I have used several of my mobile phone headsets with these for several games I own on Steam, and I have had very good results. I have had good feedback from other players on the sound quality from my microphone, and the earphone sound quality is just as good as any other set of earbuds I use on my computer. Just plug in the headset to the female connections, then the two male connections into the microphone and headphone jacks on my computer. Very simple."
5,Works for the X31 turtle Beach Headset,When i first ordered this item i was wary that it would not work on my X31 Turtle Beach Headset but i thought i would give it a shot because it was much cheaper than the alternative on the turtle beach site. I was thrilled to know that it did work and I use whenever i'm in my computer!
4,"Same As ""At Sun Records""","Heads Up collectors. I bought this title and another entitled ""At Sun Records"" and discovered they are the exact same film. Buy one or the other and save the $9.99. They both play same quality video and sound."
5,Great Book Great Author,Highly recommended series. I recommend as an alternative to the Little House series for boys. Well written.
2,sound worst than a bootleg,"I'd had bought this video(I understand now why it wasn't realeased in DVD)and wait few days before watching it with my girlfriend beside the fireplace in a cozy ambiance,but this happening took a down when it start.I cannot beleive in 2004 listening to a crappy sound like this,the worst bootleg is better than this,it is so sad because you can feel a magic medieval ambiance,with good sound this concert would be one of the best.I cannot understand Ritchie Blackmore leaving this product on the market.I hope one day it will be remastered in a near future."
2,Terrible sound quality,"I enjoy Blackmores Night very much and was really pleased to aquire this video. However, the quality of the sound is so poor that I have not even listened to all of it yet. It sounds like it was recorded on a mono cassette recorder. I am really suprised that Mr. Blackmore released something with such an awful sound track. Buy the live album instead."
1,Wished it was better,"I bought this to teach my kids Bible verses. We love music and I always learn better through a song than just straight memorizing, so I thought this would be perfect. I was so excited to get it in the mail. I popped the CD in right away so we could start learning the verses. The songs were horrible. The words were fine, but the tune and the singers were awful. I couldn't stand to listen to it, and we enjoy many kinds of music, so that made it especially bad. I would have sent it back, but the the shipping was going to cost me more than the book itself. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. It really seemed like just exactly what I was looking for. Don't buy it. You'll regret it!"
2,not ocmplete,I received the book but there was supposed to be a CD with the book and it did not come with this book. I was bummed!!
3,"paced, but interesting","The pace of this movie is steadfastly slow. The plot never really peeks in a bang manner. If you have the patience, though, it's an interesting movie to watch. The triangle relationships are humorous. Emotions never flare too high, but are displayed. All in all, a tempered film."
1,The Most Boring Movie I've Ever Had To Sit Through!,"I cannot recommend this movie at all. I know it's gotten mostly positive reviews but my date and I both wanted to leave after an hour - unfortunately we didn't know each other's wishes until after the movie was over. Even the opening credits were boring and took for ever not to mention the fact that the movie is over 2h30m long. Blech. Perhaps we were spoiled with the previous week's delightful Amelie but even so... Va Savoir is way too pretentious, way to flat and unemotional - a nihilist's lament has more emotion than this movie. I like movies about nothing but this wasn't even a movie. As we walked out of the theater, we saw a man fast asleep and I thought to myself that he made much better use of his time than we did."
2,Lost interest,"I'm writing this review just to put in my 2 cents--and maybe to save you .... I really can't tell you what this film was about because I lost interest in it along the way. Something about the leading actress who is really nervous--probably because she is afraid her ex-lover will show up in the theater one nite. And then there's the director and co-star who she is involved with. The reason I lost interest in this film is because: 1) I did not care for the characters--I found them flat and one-dimensional; and 2) I found the storyline to be very thin. Critics have compared this film to Eric Rohmer's films. I completely disasgree! ""Va Savoir"" doesn't compare to films like ""Autumn Story,"" ""Boyfriends and Girlfriends,"" or ""Summer."" Those films didn't have much of a storyline either, but at least I cared about the characters who I found interesting. From a moviegoer who is a big Rohmer, Truffaut, Woody Allen, Bergman fan--I cannot recommend ""Va Savoir."""
1,uninspired drek,"well since there are varied types of reviews on this film here i figured id chime in. this film is incredibly boring, completely uninteresting, the main character does nothing but whine, and when you finally find out what about you want to smack the crap out of her for dragging you into her incredibly mundane over-yet-underdramatized world. none of the characters are vaguely interesting and it runs slower than a snails pace. i generally love french cinema but i saw this one... i think im staying away from anything french for awhile. thank god for jeunet and caro, and films such as the dreamlife of angels. stay away from this. anyone giving this film any decent kind of review has a great deal of pretension about them. absolutely unredeeming crap."
4,Good read,"I find comics to be a visual art form and so, while good writing is obviously important, if the pictures aren't appealing, IMO there's little point to a comic book. That being said, while there have been many various incarnations of Catwoman over the years, I really like Darwyn Cooke's version, and bought this graphic novel to see more of his work. It's a decent enough read, but really, nothing they've done recently measures up to Selina's Big Score."
4,An almost perfect blend of story & art!,"Ed Brubaker and Darwyn Cooke come together and produce a near perfect reinvention of Selina Kyle and Catwoman. This is such a departure of the Jim Balent stuff of years past. Brubaker creates a world and Selina's role in it perfectly. Darwyn Cooke's art is so beautiful and suited for this atmosphere. The opening pages of this (from Detective Comics back-up stories) featruing Slam Bradley aren't great but bring the reader up to speed. The main issue here, to me, is the villain's striking resemblence to another Bat-villain. A little to close for me. Overall, a very good book!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is a change in style for Catwoman, for both the character and the comic. Gone is Balent's purple suited bodacious buxom action babe, and in is the blacker, darker gritty underworld in the shadows kind of woman.A change in color scheme and costume to go along with this, of course, and to offer a bit more protection."
2,first off santa chose the wrong color for my male dog. nuff said,"I was very dissapointed with this bag-o-balls, I originally purchased these for my shepard, he uses these like humans use bubble gum, they make him happy. This bag the balls collapsed within moments of giving to him. when I Purchased the first bag, they lasted for 2 months, this bag lasted a week."
3,It got me interested enough to learn more...,"I'm sorry to say that I'm not really very interested in WHY the author first applied the concept of real options in his work. However, seeing the potential applications in other areas of business made reading a bit more interesting. If you can't (or don't want) the math behind real options, then this book isn't too bad. If, on the other hand, this is the topic for your own dissertation...I'd look elsewhere."
3,a good conceptual practitioner's guide but has many errors,"Although this book has so many misprints , I found this book useful for the ""hints"" it provides, as a valuation software developer and equity analyst , I always try to find the hints behind the formulas and implementations, not the exactly implementation methods . From this point of view, this book is good for a ""Conceptual Practitioner's Guide"" , besides that , I think no one book is good enough for directly implementation because generally , there are many intended ""coincidences"" within examples to prevent the competitors from copying it , if you directly follow the procedures and details described in one book(even if it's a bible-type textbook) without doing some ""micro-engineering""(that means you must trace every formula in a mathematical way, and find the possible adjustments) , I can be sure that you will run into many traps and you don't know it at all."
3,Innovative ideas that could profit from better presentation,"The merit of the book is that it is the first one that tries to bring real options methodology down to the managerial level, and the problems of the book only shows how hard it is to make this sofisticated theory usefull to a broader audience. Simplification usually takes the form of a few strong assumptions, and this book is no exception. But the practitioner should know what these assumptions are so that he know how accurate (or inacurate) is his valuation, but he will not find this information in the book."
4,Easy to understand...,"and understanding the value of real options is important. If you are in a position of making or influencing decisions regarding capital expenditures, then you need to understand the deficiencies of traditional metrics such as IRR and NPV and how real options more accurately reflect the cost and value of an investment.If you want to learn the calculus behind real options...go for one of the academic texts instead."
2,"Promising, but some serious problems for beginners","This book has some good moments, but for beginners to real options it assumes too much knowledge. The writing style is inconsistent (e.g. you can definitely tell that two authors wrote it) and the examples are not presented in a user-friendly step-by-step fashion. Many of the examples (for example, I'm trying to follow their instructions to create an option valuation spreadsheet) have errors in them."
2,Good content marred,"The organization, writing style, and content of this book are all good, providing the moderately mathematical practitioner with the material needed to understand the concepts. The book is marred however, with a number of typographical errors that is in my experience unprecedented. While it is difficult to ensure that every formula and number in a work of this sort is correct, this book looks like nobody copyread it. My copy has marks on half the pages, ranging from minor stuff to things that left me scratching my head in an attempt to figure out what the authors meant."
2,"Good book, but a lot of errors","They should give me credit, there are a lot of wrong numbers in the book sould not be seen in a financial book."
2,Caldera Openlinux Edesktop 2.4,"This is not a real book dedicated to the new Caldera Openlinux Edesktop 2.4. What you get is the same box that you get when buying the same software at Best Buy. The only add-on is a small useless book called Linux Desk Reference, 1/e Scott Hawkins, Braselton, Georgia ISBN 0-13-016391-0 $34.99. Don't buy this if you are looking for a Caldera specific reference. The reference is just that! For any version of Linux."
3,A student's review,"I have an Assoc degree in Info-sys and am now working on a BBA in management. I used this book in my psychology of decision making class as a suppliment to an assignment. Coming from an analytical background, I find it a severe challenge to think outside the classic IT's frame of mind. Put me in a room of artists and I'll scream for mercy inside ten minutes!This book is good as a starter for learning how to present a persuasive argument. But, there's no way I'd would pay $150 for it. I read it for free at the school library. It's only 20 pages, minus the credits and references."
3,Decent turn-of-the-century poetry,"The style is almost exclusively iambic pentameter rhyme, with some interesting deviations from the more classic rhyme schemes. I found that some of the poems were well written and evocative, but others... not so much. The book was hit-and-miss for me, but I'm not much of a fan of this style of poetry. It seemed to read better out loud than in my head, but that too, is typical of the style (circa 1920s). As another point of interest, some of the material is topical with historical references here and there.My short answer: worth thumbing through, especially if you enjoy the style."
4,My opinion after first time of use.,"After using this fryer for the first time, I will have to say I am very pleased with it. I would have given it five stars but the cooking odor still got in my kitchen, even with the two filters. Also, I had to use a flashlight to see in the cover window. Nevertheless, it is well designed and manufactured."
4,Should not be legal!,"Why? Because it's AWESOME, that's why!This fryer makes it soooo easy to cook amazing fries at home. We haven't branched out too far with other things, though we've tried onion rings with mixed results. The reality is that this thing is the easiest way to clog arteries I've found.It's kind of nasty to deal with the old oil, and some areas of the unit are difficult to clean, but I've had this on our shelf in the kitchen for a few years now, and it is always a crowd pleaser.Con: Wish it held more to cook at one time. Otherwise, it's great!"
3,It's okay,"After reading so many good reviews on this product, I thought it would be really great. However, I found that it was it was too small even for one person. I tried to fry fish using this fryer and it was way to small to fry a few pieces evenly. I think this is okay only if you want to fry very small batches. It works okay, but like others mentioned the cord easily detaches from the unit with even the smallest movement."
5,It's nice,I bought this for my friend. She really like it. I am thinking about to this one for myself too.
1,Poorly designed fryer,"I really don't understand how all these people gave it such a high rating. I bought it due to the high ratings but it really falls short.Some of the shortcomings are:No on/off switch - you have to unplug the fryer to turn it offNot made to fry batter dipped foods. - It might be fine for fries and such but if you put a batter-dipped item in it, it sticks to the wire basket, and you have to scrape it off with a knife after each batch. Yuck.There is no spout to pour out the oil for cleaning. -It is a mess to clean!Much better off with a pan on the stove."
4,We like the fryer,"I read customer reviews for this fryer and decided it would be a good fit for our usage. We fry about once or twice a month, mostly veggies and shrimp tempura. After using it several times, I'm wiser about the frying basket. It is not good to use it with tempura. All of the batter sticks to the basket, so you'll need to tear off the batter in order to remove the food from the basket after cooking. I'm just dropping the food directly into the vat from now on. Each shrimp turns out perfect!"
4,how easy it is to teach to the normal and miss all the fringe students,I loved the way the author included so many ways to teach so many. Not just the normal verbal linguistic students but all of us who learn in other ways.
3,"Nice idea, but smells funny","My kids begged for Super Sudzer soap, and I had a coupon, so I relented. With a good coupon it costs about the same as other bar soap packs. You get 3 Super Sudzer bars to a box. We bought the watermelon scented. The scent is ok when you sniff it directly, and it smells ok (but not fab) on the kids' skin, but the day after I bought it I noticed the kids' bathroom smelled a little rank. I investigated (little boys are infamous for ""missing their mark""), but couldn't pinpoint the source of the strange odor. I removed the Super Sudzer from the bathroom, and the rank odor left with it. Go figure."
3,Shakti Yoga,"Disappointed with Bija Mantras as Sound is wrong order, thought Ham should be throat and Yam Heart area and is reverse on CD."
5,Worth buying - An absolute experience,"The first title track is really awesome..I am yet to hear the others. I heard of the ""om nama shivaya"" song as a background track to a video on youtube. I was hooked. But, I wanted a high quality mp3 version and this album gives you that. Really, shakes you up inside out.. this song.. in a wonderful way. My first review on amazon and really felt like giving one."
4,Animal Lovers,The book was a bit long in parts but thought provoking as to what will be discovered in the future. I did enjoy the read and the twists it took.
3,Going to the dogs?,"I'm not sure I wouldn't give this book two stars if it was written by anyone but Tepper; being one of my all-time favorite authors earns her a bit of a mulligan. Maybe I really have seen this heroine, these ecological, gender-relations and political themes too many times from Tepper. The pro-animal stance has a neat twist to it this time, with evil aliens taking the form of dogs in order to appear harmless, and there is a very cool character reminiscent of Tolkien's ents, and there is some interesting speculation about scent as a language. So there are several good bits, but as a whole the effort is scattered over too many ideas and venues, with a couple of seemingly important and certainly intriguing characters getting insufficient ink, and with everything getting tied up all too neatly and quickly in the end. Tepper is much, MUCH better than this."
3,Easy installation but missing two nuts,This was a great product to put together but instructions were not detailed enough and two nuts were missing. Not worth shipping back for over $100 product.
4,Helpful review,"The product itself seems solid and works as described. I installed it on the face of my garage in about five hours (including the backboard and rim). My only complaints are the depth that it sticks out from the garage at the low to mid level settings and the overall size. I have a 15'x 24' driveway and the lift system and backboard are big for the space. However, I my kids are young and it changes height with ease. I feel it will be able to be used for years to come."
5,More than enough for my wonderful grandchildren.,Wonderful and truly made it quickly and met all my needs. Thanks....You guys are good at what you do. keep it up
5,Addition to My Library,"I have a small collection of dictionaries and reference books, but I didn't have anything dealing with ""antonyms and synonyms"". This book is great for my library."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Buyer beware! I purchased this book new from Amazon - not used from a reseller. When it arrived, I noticed that it only contained word entries through ""swagger."" All entries past that - from T to Z - were missing.I had much better luck with Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus, 3rd edition (ISBN 978-0-440-24269-7). That book contains many more words, and includes antonyms for almost all of them. It's a much more thorough book. Don't waste your money on this half-a-book."
2,Don't bother unless you are a new diabetic,"This book doesn't have many recipes in it. It has some. Mostly it has suggestions such as for dinner you are to get a thin and crispy pizza from Pizza hut and have a salad with it. Or for Breakfast 1 package of instant oatmeal, wheat germ, 1 mini pack of raisons, and 1 cut fat free milk. For lunch one such suggestion is 1 Stouffer's lean cuisine cheese cannelloni 1/2 cup steamed broccoli, with margarine and 2 bread sticks and 2 cups mixed berries. Those aren't recipes!! The recipes are ok but because my husband is a picky eater we can only try about 5 of them. There are only about 28 recipes included. I'm not totally sorry I bought the book because my husband is newly diagnosed and it does have some good information in the book for newly diagnosed people. I will NEVER buy any of the others."
1,Out of date material,"On looking at the ""Forward"" I packaged the book for return; but then reconsidered and opened the diskette. Now I am stuck with it. Don't make the same mistake. This book was written to long ago to be of use. The code was written for Version 1 of what is now VC++6.0. It will not compile. The IDE does not even recognize the project or workspace extensions, it is so old."
4,Olive Drab Thermal Knit Underwear Bottoms,"This item arrived promptly via USPS in good condition as ordered. Quality is good, much better than similar products found in Wall Mart stores. I wore them to a college football game & they performed as expected. Caution, unlike the top, these bottoms tend to run smaller than average for U.S. customers. I strongly recommend ordering one size larger than your normal size to ensure a correct fit."
1,Horrible tasting,I like the flavor of coconut water. I love the flavor of mango.This tastes nothing like the combination of the two.Can somebody please explain what 100% natural from concentrate means?
3,They are okay,"I was first introduced these at my yoga studio,of course everyones gona love them after you sweat all your salt out.I then bought them at whole foods and now trader joes are selling them.I suggest not to buy the large carton unless you are gona to drink the whole thing in one day or share it.It doesnt last well after your open it and try to drink it the next day.Its okay, not bad not the best.I give it a c"
2,Its not their fault,I have no problem with Zico...its the Coconut water that is the problem. It tastes like sour milk water. If you have not had it before try it some where else before committing to a whole case. If you already know that you like Coconut water then this product is great (besides the whole coconut water thing). The packaging is nice and everything works great except the water. If i ever wanted to drink another coconut water then i would buy Zico again.
5,ZICO COCONUT WATER,"This coconut water is great tasting!! It naturally hydrates,is a great thrist quencher and is a good source of electrolytes. This is one of my favorite drinks in the summer."
4,fantastically refreshing!,"I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though."
5,Win-win,"There's absolutely nothing bad to say about ZICO in the new bottle. It's a win-win. It's super healthy, super delicious, convenient, and portable. And it's environmentally friendly in at least 2 ways - the bottle and cap are recyclable, and we're not paying to ship water across the ocean!! We have got to move in this direction for the health of the planet. YOU have got to move in this direction for the health of your bod!!"
1,ITS VERY NASTY TASTE !,I HATE THE TASTE OF ZICO COCONUT WATER. ITS VERY NASTY TASTE . I DONT LIKE TO ORDER THAT ANYMORE !!
2,Smells like dog breath,"First off, when I got my 6 pack of this stuff, it was VERY warm in my hand. I don't know if it was ruined in shipment, or whatever, but it smells hella funky. I asked my mom why it smells so off, but she says that's how it's supposed to smell, which is funny because I remember when I used to drink coconut water out of the coconut it didn't smell so weird.Second, I don't know if I ruined my taste buds by drinking ginger ale, but this does NOT taste like coconut water! I'll update my review in another, but honestly, I don't think I'm gonna grow to like this. I'm truly disappointed :/"
1,Acquired taste,"I strongly agree w/the reviewer who suggested trying a single serving of this before ordering a case. I had read great things about the benefits of coconut water but I found both the taste and the consistency to be extremely unpleasant. I will usually persevere in the name of good health but I simply couldn't stomach this stuff. When I need electrolytes, I'll continue to use water + Emergen-C."
2,This flavor is not for me,"Taste is highly subjective but I'll add my opinion here. I usually buy fresh coconuts from Asian supermarkets or grocery stores. I've also had fresh coconut water while traveling to Hawaii, Bali, Thailand and Malaysia.This is the first time I have tried RTD coconut water. While the packaging is attractive, the flavor just doesn't work for me. In fact, it tastes sour and slightly artificial to me, like it is a chemical mixture of some sort. I prefer coconut water that is sweeter and more aromatic.I stopped my subscription after two deliveries and have tried a few other brands. I am pleased to have found another brand that I like more. I think the only way to find one that tastes good is to try them all until you find one you like. Good luck!"
2,Bad taste,"I guess you have to be lucky to get a good batch. First batch was really good - I used it as a substitute for sports drink. So I ordered two cartons later, and both tasted pretty bad, had to throw them all."
3,Average,"I was brought up drinking fresh coconut water. I was badly disappointed with this product. Its coconut water alright but not fresh at all and tastes of water obtained from older coconuts as opposed to young or tender ones. I started looking for this because I had tasted the competing product, ""Vita Coco"" (Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)) which I had bought from a local grocery store. I bought the Zico product because of the reviews here. The Vita product is a helluva lot better. Will not buy this again."
1,Zico Coconut Water,"HATE it, it tastes like dirt, and it is not returnable. Would anyone like to buy an unopened case from me?"
5,"Some Liked It, Some Didn't",I really liked this coconut water and got to drink all of them myself without hiding any in back of the old bottles of salad dressing because the rest of the family didn't care for them.
1,Don't buy,"This doesn't taste anything like the old Tetra pack ZICO. It's now made from concentrate, which is not displayed prominently in Amazon description. DON'T BUY THIS NEW ZECO."
1,Horrible,I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container. Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled. This will be my last box of ever of Zico. I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco.
5,A nice refreshing alternative to water,"I use coconut water instead of water to make rice for a slightly sweet, nutty flavored rice. It's also nice in mixed drinks and just as a carry along drink when I go to work."
1,Shame on you,Skewing reviews by having reps put out a string of 5 star ratings is a great way to guarantee I will never buy your product again.
3,"Good Drink, But Too High In Sugar And Calories.","I noticed the Zico Coconut Water at my nearby grocery store and I tried a couple varieties of it. The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.Gary Peterson"
1,Bad batch ?? will not buy again,"Received the order from Amazon yesterday. I tried it this morning but could not get beyond the awful smell and taste. This must be a bad quality control because I had tried Zico at a local grocery store and the taste was pretty good to me, although I have to admit it was not as good as fresh coconut juice. Just tried the second bottle - same disgusting taste. Gave one to friends to try,they all agreed the taste was really bad. Glad I ordered only one pack (of 12); will not buy this brand again."
1,I Felt Cheated... All 12 of them were bad,Received my package today and then tried drinking and the first one was bad.. tried second and third they were bad too.. it literally stinks very bad and cant even drink a single drop.. I felt cheated by Zico.. Never should have bought this and should have bought the brand that i always buy. I wasted 16$ on this and i am not going to get it back am i?? since Amazon doesnt let me return this item as per their return policy.
1,That was the WORST tasting drink that I have EVER had.,That stuff is horrible! Shouldn't b sold 2 anyone...bluck. I want my money back! It was a waste of money. AND I'm stuck w/ this nasty crap because u can't return it. Beware....it is horrible!!!! My dog wouldn't even drink it.
4,Good Taste!,This coconut water is one of my favorites. The taste is sweet and clean. I'd recommend it to any coconut water lover.
1,Tastes like plastic-YUCK!,Have purchased this product in different cities from different stores. The consistent thing? It tastes like plastic. Nasty. I will not be buying this product ever again.
3,Coconut Water - UNSWEATENED,ehhhhh! Just got back from Jamaica and enjoyed fresh from the tree. this stuff tastes a bit sour. Make sure you've tasted this before and that you like it before buying a whole case... I'd stick w/ a tiny bit of sugar added to those other brands that really makes it taste fantastic.
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"Product arrived this morning. Put it in fridge all day. Just took a couple sips. This stuff is absolutely gross. They have done something to ruin this product.Someone has been stealing food from the fridge at work, so I'm going to put the remaining ones there.If you get a batch with an APR 21, 2012 expiration, spare yourself and throw it out. (Or poison your enemy.)"
1,11 OZ is from Thailand not Brazil,"The product description says that 11OZ contains Brazil coconut water. The one I received says ""Product of Thailand"". Be aware of the false information.The taste was ok. I ordered 34OZ before and I didn't liked the taste. I ordered these to see if Brazil coconut water makes any difference. No use. It has same taste as 34OZ one."
1,"used to be great, now awful. what happened to my zico?!","this product WAS good enough that i had a 'subscribe and save' order set up to receive regular shipments...but the flavor has been getting progressively worse, and i've finally given up. no idea what happened, but the latest order tasted like bad dishwater (perhaps slightly coconut flavored) and there's really no point in drinking it. i cancelled my recurring order and got a refund for the last batch--kudos to amazon.used to recommend it highly and drink it daily, but no longer. bummer."
1,Couldn't take the taste,First sip had me feeling sick! I'm not sure if it is because I just don't like Passion Fruit or because I don't like Passion fruit and coconut water. I really wanted to like this flavor but luckily Amazon gave me a refund so it wasn't too bad of a deal for me. I'll stick with the delicious chocolate flavor :).
1,DISGUSTING!,"This is so gross. Zico should be ashamed!My reflex pulled the bottle back before too much got in my mouth after it hit my tongue.We gave the rest to my sister to put in her work fridge with a sign that said, ""Healthy but gross"""
2,ZICO Coconut Water 33.8oz(pack of 6) for $17.52 - does not taste real,Bought the ZICO Coconut Water 33.8oz(pack of 6) while it was on-sale for $17.52(was about 2 months from expiry date).ZICO does not taste like real coconut water and am disappointed with it. I have tried ZICO in the past and it was alright but lately it seems to leave an odd taste in the mouth.Buy if its on sale and if the expiry date is more than 6 months otherwise give this a pass.
3,Zico 33.8 (6 pack) Leaking issues.. beware,Had leaking from 4 of 6 containers. the top caps seems to be weak part that it easily breaks.. amazon did refund the leaky ones.. but I won't order these..again.. Don't want to take another chance on leaks.. although these taste better than the plastic resealable ones at 11oz.
3,Zico Pure Premium coconut water 14oz. Not so Tastey!,"Just got my order.. good thing.. nothing leaked like the Zico 33.8 Oz (6pack).I've had about 5 so far.. have to say.. Vita Coco taste alot better. I do like the resealable packaging.. but, taste not so good.. as some reviewers said.. taste plasticy... I think I will stick with vita Coco."
2,It must be from a coconut that has gone bad,"I started with Vita a week ago, and decided to try all three top brands. Zico is my second try. Although I don't like Vita that much, Zico is definitely worse.Zico coconut water is not sweet at all, which usually is a plus for soft drinks, except this time. It has a sour after taste and your tongue feels dull, NOT refreshing at all.Stay away from this brand."
1,Yuck,"I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle, though the best before date was way in the future. But my god. This is honestly the worst drink I have ever tasted, hands down. Tastes absolutely nothing like coconut. Or water. It tastes more like Satan's salty butt hole. Ok, I'm trying to be funny with the last comment, but I'm mostly serious. Saltiness was the only thing I could taste. It literally made me gag."
1,tainted coconut water,"It's my first tme purchasing this brand of coconut water, but I have to give it a buyer beware rating. Myself and another family member both tried this water on multipule (ie. more than 3 occasions) and have had stomach pains immediately after drinking it. I suspect that this bactch may have been tainted or bad. I plan on throwing the rest out."
2,Not as good as their box water,"I had been purchasing their boxed coconutwater and that seemed to vbe discontnued and order the lrger plasticbollted water and found the taste was diffeent. I do not know if the bttle changes the taste fr the box, but is was not the same. A little disappointed in Zico."
3,Zico-sis,"Summary:This Zico is a weak shadow of its former self.Pros: Bottle looks cool?Cons: Price, from concentrate. Taste.In-depth Review:I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years. I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties. This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate. I did not pick up on a 'plastic"" taste that other reviewers had. Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down. Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from. It does not seem there are many studies done on this."
2,"Zico NOT SO ""premium"" 14oz","Taste is ok,reminds of the milk leftover in the bowl after eating your cereal.***BEWARE***My biggest issue is that its made from concentrate.(Very disappointing)Shame on them.They do not tell you that before purchase.Would not have purchased had I known.Amy and Brian's is my favorite.W/or W/out coconut pieces.I will only drink this as back-upI drink 1 glass a day."
2,Flavor Varied Significantly in Each Drink Box,"I found the flavor variable with each box. I am very familiar with coconut water. I grew up on it in the Caribbean and the US. The Zico product was not very good. Some of the boxes were bland. One box tasted of cigarette ashes immediately after opening it. There are no smokers in my house. So, the flavor had to come from the box. There was a subtle after taste to the others I tried in the 12 pack almost like watered down apple juice. None of the flavors gave off the slight sweetness found in natural coconut water. Tried them both cold and room temperature. Room temperature was the worst. Would not buy these again. I have had canned versions that tasted better."
1,I prefer the asian brands,"I've been looking for an all-natural coconut water without additives and have tried several brands. I grew up drinking the products from Thailand and liked it, but was told that sugar had been added. I've also had coconut water from the fruit itself on the beaches of Thailand and those are wonderful.This product doesn't taste like anything I've tried, it's awful. I hope it has some type of nutritional value, cause I'm going to have a hard time drinking it otherwise."
1,NASTY,"I had thought my experience was my poor luck, but it matches the last group of reviewers. 1 box was trashed, with 1 of the 12 containers exploded. It stunk like rotten bananas. I tasted a couple so far, and they taste a bit sour. I tried the 2nd box, and the first one was ""RANCID"" like the previous reviewer said. I've tried zico before in the stores, and they do not taste like this.I've O.N.E. coco water, and it's like night and day in terms of taste and quality."
3,"Nothing like the real thing, but great in smoothies.","I bought based on others positive reviews of Zico tasting like fresh young coconuts freshly shucked. Nope, tastes funny, nothing like a fresh coconut. Luckily I live in a city where I can get fresh young coconuts regularly, but my wife does not feel comfortable shucking them. She only drinks/eats them when I do it. But I am happy to have around to put in my smoothies. I wont even suggest my wife to try it."
3,It was a better product before,"I drink a lot of coconut water. The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico. Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula. It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did. It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best. I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it. Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again."
4,Love this stuff,"Wish these were a little less expensive, because I love the stuff. Buying by the case through Amazon is a lot better deal than buying them individually at the local market. There always seems to be just a little bit of an off taste when drinking the last bit out. I think it's caused by the packaging. Compared to Vita Coco, I think they are comparable. (I like the ZICO packaging better, though.)"
3,Its really nice... BUT!!!!,"Man!!! I loved the previously available tetra pack ones. For some reason, I am not able to really appreciate the goodness of bottled ZICO which has ADDED FLAVOR now. The tetra packs were really refreshing and tasting real. Being from a south-asia country where freshly chopped coconut water are available, I was really impressed with the tetra packs that was available from ZICO previously. With the added flavor in these, I can feel the artificial flavor when I drink from the bottle now. ZICO has to go back and NOT add the flavor to make it REALLY natural and original. But overall I guess I could give a B+ rating on the product."
3,Good but not the best,"I love drinking coconut juice even when I was still living in the Philippines where it was sold by a street vendor and opened right in front of you where he sticks a straw for you to drink right away the goodness and freshness of it. Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands, the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it. Maybe next time I'll try the tetra packed zico to see if I'll like it better."
3,"OK, but not my favorite.","I found this coconut water to be almost tasteless. It was more like water with a slight coconut flavor. Coconut waters are quite expensive, and I like more coconut flavor. No true complaints, there are just others I prefer to the Zico."
3,It's OK,"I thought this was my favorite coconut water among Vita, O.N.E and others. I changed my mind after extensively tasting both O.N.E. and Zico. I tried it warm and cold. It is better than Vita but there is something about Zico that I do not like. I definitely prefer O.N.E. over Zico."
2,Not as great as we had once sipped,"We were quite impressed with the ZICO coconut water we bought at Whole Foods. It was a bigger carton (something like half a gallon) and it tasted quite fresh. The one we ordered from Amazon tasted different, a little stale to be honest. It could be that it has been sitting in the seller's warehouse for a long time. Nevertheless, I will prefer to buy this product from my local store."
3,Quality/Taste Difference In Last Few Months?,"I do like some coconut water, and all this later summer and fall, I drank this exact type of coconut water frequently. I went through it so fast, I actually signed up for a subscription.I have to say, though, that right now I am disappointed and wondering what to do with a giant case I can't return. I will probably try cooking with it or adding it to smoothies. Unfortunately, the most recent batch has a tangyness to it that makes me nauseous, even when it's cold. I know it's a natural product so there will always be some variation, but I am wondering if they switched suppliers/farmers of the coconuts or something as the taste is that different.Has anyone else has this problem/noticed this shift in taste? It was an acquired taste, but I had grown to love the flavor of it over the last few months, and this new batch is very different."
3,"Great for me, acquired taste","I'm trying to acquire the taste because i know it's good for me. It says to drink chilled, and it's HORRIBLE warm (my fault - I grabbed one when they first came in, yuck) when they're cold they are better, but not good. Drink it fast, but there's no doubt it's hydrating and revitalizing. I had to laugh at the reviews suggesting coconut water for cocktails - kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?Anyhow, I will continue to buy these, but DRINK THEM COLD!"
4,Zico Coconut Water,"After trying a number of Tender Coconut water, Zico is the closest to what you get from a freshly chopped tender coconut. Delicious too."
4,A Good Mix Of Electrolytes After Heavy Workouts.,"I recently discovered Coconut water to be available in a nearby grocery store so I've been trying several of the different flavors. The latest is Zico Mango. It's all right. It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.Gary Peterson"
1,"Awful, plastic-like taste",The coconut water products that come in cans taste closest to fresh coconut water coming straight from a cracked nut. The plastic taste of the coconut water in this product is really strong and hard to ignore.
5,wow!,"I love coconut water, but usually stay away from the flavored options. Tried this on a fluke, while in an airport, and thought it was delicious. It tastes very similar to a Yoohoo, if you're familiar with that drink. Not quite the ""refreshing"" taste that I think the plain coconut water has, but definitely a tasty beverage that I find enjoyable. If you like chocolate, this is a good beverage."
1,Really icky stuff. Go with the Tetra-Paks instead,"I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of ""natural flavors"", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons:ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12).These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks."
2,"Product is ok as far as coconut water goes, but bottle designs suck!","Coconut water tastes ok as far as bottled coconut water goes. The real thing is what I have grown up on, so I have to settle. But I don't like this bottle, the packets should be better. When you open the wrapper, you have to be careful because there are plastic pieces as sharp as a knife still hanging around and you can cut your finger or lip on it...I have!"
3,product changed?,"We luved original Zico, but now its taste totally different.When introduced it was pure coconut water which was just pasteurized. Now it says its from concentrate.Taste little different now!"
1,Plastic,"This tastes like plastic. And coconut water from ""concentrate"" and ""natural flavors"" is not coconut water. I'll just go back to buying mine at the grocery store that has pulp in it, and comes in a glass bottle."
3,Little disappointed..,"I have tried zico, naked, one brand, and I disliked zico most.Naked was most fresh coconut water tasting."
1,Not happy with Zico,"My first order arrived in a box that smelled somewhat like mold. The containers inside did not but the odor of the box - from Brazil, packed in Brazil - did remind me of humid tropical locations where it is difficul to keep things from mold ... I will NOT buy it again. I would not even give it a ""one star"" if possible. If bought in a local store I would have taken it back - but it is a hassle by mail. The flavor of the juice is bland and does not encourage me to buy more. I may try another brand though. And probably NOT packed in the tropics. VM"
2,weird metallic scent/aftertaste,"On a recent trip to Jamaica, I fell in love with fresh coconut water, straight out of the baby coconut. I read a bunch of reviews about the top three brands and went with Zico since overall they seemed to get the best reviews. I ordered a case and anxiously awaited it's arrival. I was VERY disappointed to find that this coconut water has a strange scent that hits you as you go to take a sip, as well as a weird aftertaste. It's hard to describe...almost a metallic taste? Also sort of sour like others have said. Since I spent so much money on this stuff I really want to like it and want to at least be able to tolerate it, but I'm just not sure that I can force myself to do it. My husband agrees that it's not good and he won't drink it either. I've read that coconut water is good for your skin and can be used as a facial toner so if nothing else I may keep a few containers for that purpose, but chances are most if not all of this coconut water is going down the drain : ("
4,"Zico Pure Coconut Water, Natural Flavor, 11-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)",I like this coconut water because it is not too high in calories and is almost pure. It is not very sweet and it is very refreshing. I only buy it when I can get it about half off because I do not want to spend more than at the grocery store.
3,"Weird taste, maybe spoiled?","Was getting VitaCoco, decided to try this brand. First impression was that it tasted weird, maybe a little spoiled. Subsequent tastings elicit an ""OK"" but not much more. I still prefer VitaCoco at this point.I have a couple more of these, so I'll update this review if I change my mind."
2,Too sweet,"Similar to the ONE flavored option, I found this to be a bit too sweet, though not quite as much. The sugar content didn't appear to be too high, but the taste was a bit off."
1,Can coconut water go bad?,"Each pak is sealed well. But the liquid is cloudy yellow and very bitter, with no coconut flavor or odor at all, so I don't know if it tastes the way it's supposed to. Please let me know if this is normal for this brand or not. I'm tempted to throw them all out."
2,SoSo,"Coconut water not for me, but will keep it in my emergency kit...just in case we get any more of those earthquakes and it nocks out power for awhile....lol!"
4,Pineapple? No thanks.,"The coconut water tastes good, it's like most other coconut waters on the market. Good coconut flavor, a little salty from the electrolytes, but overall pretty good.The pineapple ""flavor"" however, ruins it. At the price I bought it for, $6 on Amazon Warehouse, I'd buy it again, because coconut water is usually fairly expensive and the stuff is still decent, but the pineapple is like a bad afterthought, like your in-laws staying over for a week and then telling you they'll be here 2 more nights."
4,ZICO AND VITACOCO,"MY SON PREFERS ZICO AND I PREFER VITACOCO. Both are delicious and extremely healthy for you.When I order I get both. My family thinks Zico is less sweet than Vitacoco and like it a tad better. It is a very close second to Vitacoco in my book. By the way, each family member drinks at least two a day. These drinks have replaced soda."
4,Refreshing but sweet,"I don't think I would want to drink it daily as it's a little on the sweeter side. If I keep it room temperature and then pour over crushed ice it tastes just like chocolate milk which is novel as I don't consume any dairy. I don't think I would like it without being over ice, though. My kids use coconut water for workout recovery drink. Thought they might like this for a change but both find it too sweet to drink straight from the bottle."
1,"Coconut water is coconut water, chocolate is chocolate.","I have been drinking Zico coconut water for sometime. One day I saw Zico Chocolate Coconut water. So gave it a try. well, to me it was chocolate drink but my expectation of a coconut water was not there.I threw rest of the bottle and kept my distance from this drink.Agreed that Zico coconut water is not the best coconut water but it is close enough to enjoy without any other ingredient in it and definitely not chocolate."
2,Price is absurd.,This is the basically the cheapest form to buy any of the three popular coconut water. I did the math and to put the cost in retrospective it comes to $10 per 2 liters of this coconut water.This may not register to some with no concept of themselves being ripped off. There are other things out there that are better quality and less expensive and more specific for what you are looking for. If your look for something to quench thirst I highly recommend Metromint water. If your looking for things for your natural lifestyle then find a fruit with more umph than coconut.
3,coconut water,"I have ordered 4 or 5 times from Amazon and brought 2 times from local grocery stores. My experience with Amazons 30% deal has been odd. Every time i ordered on a special 15% off (amazon coupon) the taste has been really bad. I had vita coco and zico both. every time i order using regular rate , the taste is good. the taste from grocery was good both the times especially vita coco. i am not sure if this is true with others."
4,"Taste is good, but not like the real thing","This coconut drink don't taste so bad and very refreshing. Not a lot of sugar, which I like. Not sure why other reviewer said it taste like plastic. Had it chill cold, before consuming. Have more proteins then a banana as it listed. Compare to Vita and Naked brand this the better tasting and lighter then the other two. Naked is the worst of the three tasting coconut drink. It don't taste like a real coconut and I'm glad it don't. Real coconut taste is not as sweet and it a bit bitter. Wish price would be better."
1,Tastes like plastic!,I loved the old Zico water in the square containers and couldn't wait for Amazon to get this in. I got the two cases I ordered today and it tastes terrible! It actually tastes like plastic or some sort of chemical/pesticide. Even after chilling it and pouring into a glass it is still not drinkable. Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead. It was my second favorite until now and I will never buy another bottle of ZICO.Who cares if you can recycle the bottle if the product is not fit to drink? What a waste of $60!
5,LOVING IT!,"I love the new Zico in a bottle! To me, it tastes the most like real coconut water straight from the coconut. Even when it was in tetra, Zico was my favorite (VitaCoco tastes like pure garbage and ONE isn't so great either) but I love that it is finally in a bottle so that I can take it with me to the gym and anywhere else I'm going.Can't wait to try the other flavors!!"
1,"NOT ""natural""","Although Zico may claim to be natural, I disagree since it is made from concentrate. I prefer to drink Vita Coco, which is a much more flavorful brand of coconut water and is actually 100% NATURAL!"
1,Don't be tempted by the price...,"The new price is very attractive. However, it tastes horrible. Maybe if you haven't had the old Zico, or any other of the coconut water brands you might find it acceptable."
1,Horrible Packaging!!!!!!!!,"4 of the 6 bottles were ruptured. How do you get a refund for a problem like this? Apparently the caps on top of the bottles rip off quite easily. Might be a good product, just not safe for shipping."
1,"an ""acquired"" taste","WOW - this stuff tastes really bad, almost to the point of being undrinkable.For anyone thinking would have the flavor of coconut juice, but not as thick - WRONG! It has an unpleasant odor when you open the bottle, tastes bad and leaves an unwanted aftertaste. Drink it ice cold and it's marginally better, but still nasty."
1,did not like it aatt all,i would not recommend this product to anyone. i thought the taste was horrible. my question is does all coconut water taste like this or is it this brand?
2,Not as good as Vita,"If you've had Vita Coconut water before, then I doubt one would like Zico. I felt a slight artificial flavor the moment I took the first swig. Having had organic tender coconut from nature, I feel Vita Coco comes the closest to the real one. Zico is not bad save that artificial taste probably due to the addition of extra electrolytes. It was definitely a good alternative to soda or Gatorade when you return from a game of soccer or baseball but not so good when you want a drink at home. I would suggest Vita coconut water."
1,Tastes like plastic...,"While the plastic packaging seemed oh-so-convenient for me, when I opened the first bottle and took a sip- YUCK. Plastic is all I taste. Then I noticed that it was also from concentrate!? What!? Way to ruin your product Zico. Wish I'd read these reviews first."
1,"Loved it till plastic, added flavors and concentrate were brought in","How do you kill a good product ?Well, bring Coke and they know how to take nature's pure coconut water, add a bunch of flavors, destroy the taste and package them in genuine plastic.Sorry, I will go for another product.."
2,Step in the wrong direction,"I've been drinking coconut water for years and I've tried them all ONE, Vita Coco, Naked, etc.. Zico was my favorite until this recent change where they added a new ingredient called ""natural flavor"". It use to be be pure coco water but the new ingredient change the taste for me. This was one of the highest reviewed coco waters on Amazon before this change...what a pity...I'm dropping Zico from my auto-ship and going back to something that doesn't have artificial ""natural flavor"" added to what should be pure coco water."
1,New Tetrapak Zico not as good as old Tetrapak Zico,"I used to order the original Zico sold in Tetrapaks, before they introduced the plastic bottle version. It was great... very refreshing and not too sweet. The new re-introduced Zico in the Tetrapaks tastes nothing like the previous version. It has a somewhat strong syrupy sweet/sour taste that leaves a weird residue on your tongue. I came back to this product thinking that it would be the same as before they messed with it, but I think I'm done with Zico. I was getting shipments of O.N.E. (which is wonderful), but sadly they have been out of stock. I guess I will have to wait for them to restock again..."
2,Good at first but later crap,"I don't know what happened, ZICO was good at first but after awhile it started to taste syrupy. Also, we received one order that had a couple of bad packs. The bad packs had this mysterious black liquid in them that gave a foul smell. That was the last straw and I will never purchase ZICO again."
4,Cocoa Puffs...,"This tastes just like the milk left after a bowl of cocoa puffs....which, if you ask me, is a good thing.It would get 5 stars if it weren't for the added sugar.If I had the choice, I'd give it a 4.5 b/c at least they used cane sugar."
5,1 a day,The most refreshing drink you can buy.(MHO)Wish the trees would grow here in Colorado so I could get the coconut jelly too.
4,Can't get more authentic!,"Zico coconut water is awesome - it's real refreshing, and tastes perfect everytime. Growing up in a tropical country, I've had ready access to natural coconut water, and as anybody who's had fresh coconut water can attest to, it doesn't taste perfect everytime. You could end up with a bad or not-so-ripe coconut and that ruins the taste of the water. That's one of the things I love about Zico - it tastes PERFECT...EVERYTIME.I'm not an athlete, and wouldn't know how hydrating this is, but I love the taste and love that it's a healthful substitute for soda, and drink a few 11-ounce units everyday.I would have given this product 5 stars if not for the insane price. At a pack of 12 a week, my bank account is depleting quicker with Zico coconut water purchases than with anything else.Amazon shipping is perfect as always, and I'm as happy with the service from Amazon as I am with the quality of the product."
2,Okay...,Doesn't taste like real coconut water. They may have used extremely young coconuts (that are are not desirable) or some second-rate coconut crop.
5,ZICO - Great stuff - a bit expensive!,ZICO Coconut Water is great stuff. I wish I could find it somewhere where it wasnt soo expensvie. It is a bit expensive!
2,tasteless,"I am a coconut water fiend! I have been drinking coconut water since a child and think this is the most tasteless one I have tried! Try 'One' or Vita coco, IF you like real coconut water!"
1,Gross,"Plug your nose and chug. This stuff is disgusting. Had to pour it into a glass and drink it all at once because once you taste this stuff, you won't be able to take another gulp until you forget about it the next day. Get the coconut water by Naked Juice. Way better."
3,"Good juice, TOO expensive","This product tastes fine. HOWEVER, at $2.00 per box, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too expunsive....$1.00, maybe $1.25 tops. ZICO, VOULME, VOLUME, VOLUME! I bought these cheap from AMAZON over BLACK FRIDAY. AMAZON, sell these at my prices above and I will order these from you on a subscription basis. But not at $2.00."
1,"If you liked it in tetrapak box, don't buy now",I bought this new Zico water hoping to have the good taste it had before but unfortunately it tastes horrible. I could not bear drinking half bottle. Very funky taste. I am from Brazil and I sure know what young coconut water tastes like...and what they did to the taste of it is nowhere close to real coconut water. Perhaps works for those who like aged coconut water.I wish I could return my order. Never buying it again. Back to O.N.E.
1,I don't know how they managed to ruin this product.,The old Zico was delightful. This new version is so aweful as to be totally undrinkable. I am now watering my plants with it. How did they manage to ruin a parfeclty good product. Is Zico now owned by Pepsico?
1,"Whoa, price jump much???","LOVE this coconut water. After a workout (or a night out a bit too late) this stuff is like magic. Rehydrates you immediately, even stops the headache you can get from being dried out. My first shipment was Subscribe and Save for $18.28. They apparently cancelled that program and are now asking $54.40. INCREDIBLY diappointed, loved the product but that kind of a price jump is ridiculous. Over 200%."
1,From Concentrate- Dishwater,"They source from many locations, partly owned by PepsiCo, from concentrate. The result is a bland drink that tastes like a bit like grass and dirt."
1,Leaky Items,There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water. There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking. Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in. I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.
5,Mango is really mango-e,"If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an ""organic"" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the ""essence of mango"" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either."
1,used to be great...not any longer.,"frankly i don't care about the packaging, (some folks are up in arms about the new plastic bottles rather than the old tetra packs) but zico--which used to be my favorite coco water--no longer tastes as good as it once did. then i read that it's now FROM CONCENTRATE rather than being what it once was, and i don't see any reason to purchase it any longer. very disappointed."
3,different taste from case to case,"i love coconut water & zico is the best one in my opinion. the problem i have with it is the taste is not consistent from case to case. this urks me, one case tasted so gross i had to contact amazon about it. zico needs to do some kind of quality control! other than that, i love it & am willing to suffer through this quirk."
1,Gross!,"I'm not entirely sure whether to blame Zico or the store where I bought it -- a Trader Joe's in Westfield, NJ -- but this tastes foul! It tastes like funky dishwater. I'm having trouble getting the taste out of my mouth and enjoying the rest of my lunch. I've had coconut water before and taking a sip of this was a really, really awful surprise. I wish I had bought one of the ""good"" cartons."
1,unpleasant at best,Tried the Tetra pack for the first time. Nasty bitter tasting...I had to mask it with a dash of MIO just to get it down.(Perhaps if I use it in cooking I will find a way to finish the case.)
3,Prefer Vita Coco,I have tried several and Vita is still my favorite! I did the subscription service on this one as a trial run and it worked out well. I'll do again but will go with Vita.
2,bad taste,"It does not taste like pure coconut water,Its taste like some drink with coconut flavour. I wouldn't prefer these bottles instead i would go for zico smaller packs. they taste better than these bottled drink."
2,Very Disappointed,"I based my purchase entirely upon user feedback. It may be the packaging (non-hermetic) that is impacting the taste, but this product was simply bland. I reviewed the ingredients and is is reconstituted. Perhaps coconut looses flavor during the dehydration process. Nonetheless, I will struggle through the remaining 10 bottles and cancel my Amazon subscription for it. Off to the next brand..."
4,Zico,"I have been receiving Zico coconut water for the past several months . I totally enjoy the product, a good source of potassium and electrolytes,a good value and the convenience of home delivery."
5,My favorite flavor...,"I've had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me. It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands. This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There's also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth!"
1,awful after taste,I have eight of these bottles sitting in my cupbard and unfortunately I cannot get myself to drink them. Awful after taste in the plastic bottle. Will not buy this product again. The boxed version tastes much better.
3,"Okay product, poor Amazon service","I tried the subscription service for this. Amazon decided not to bother notifying me when they had no stock. Considering these are all advanced orders I have trouble understanding 1). why a subscription is not fulfilled, and 2). Why Amazon does not have the courtesy to notify their customers when they are not shipping a subscription. I have other vendors that would not hesitate to correct issues like this. I doubt I will bother with Amazon subscription services again."
5,Just right,"I really like this Coconut water because it has nothing added to it. It tastes just right and not too sweet like so many brands. There are several drinks that try to pass themselves off as coconut water, but all thats in the can is corn syrup with coconut chunks floating around in it. This has no artificial sweetner at all and tastes natural. This is not for people who want something sweet. If you want that go buy Goya Coconut flavored drink.Since this in not available at Amazon right now a close second is O.N.E. Coconut Water. O.N.E. kind of tastes like it has a small splash of milk in it (there isn't though) and is a little bit more tart. Zico is the best in my opinion, but I do not really want to pay close to $12 in shipping so I will have to drink O.N.E until Zico is available for Amazon Prime."
4,Not my favorite but good for you!,"Not sure if I would buy this again- Didn't really enjoy the taste but its good for you, and made my body feel good after a workout- Must have chilled, horrible room temp- It was ok for coconut water I suppose, interested in trying other brands :)"
3,VitaCoco is better,I read all these great review on this brand so I decided to try it. I think it's ok but I definitely like VitaCoco better.This one has a funny taste. VitaCoco taste better.
2,Zico coconut water,I did not like the taste as compared to other brands of coconut water. The only plus was the size bottle
3,"Good, but not the best flavor","I went online to find the Zico Passion Fruit coconut water and found that amazon had it for the cheapest price. afte trying the regular, passion fruit and mango I would have to say the regular is my favorite, mango second and the passion fruit last. the passion fruit just didnt taste very good to me and had a defining artificial taste."
1,Worst coconut water i have ever had,This drink taste nothing like coconut water. This disgusting and i don't know how anybody can drink this crap. I wasted $2.50 on this drink that tasted like boiled water with a hint of nasty coconut.
1,HORRIBLE,So I love coconut water and I've tried this brand before. I bought it from safeway and was very satisfied with the flavor. Well I ordered this online and I gatta say I was VERY disappointed! 7 of the 12 boxes were rancid! I immediately canceled my subscription and sent a very angry email to the Zico company! it's too bad I cant send these spoiled ones back.. I mean really 7/12?? One or two I understand but this is unacceptable!
1,very disappointed.,"This thing tastes like it has fermented and it was left a little bit longer it would turn into a local wine. I am surprised people who already used this product recommended this product with good things to say about the taste. Believe me if I were to choose between this one and a bitter Melon, I would go for the later one. We had guests over the day we received this product and offered it to them. They were like what the hell is this. One sip and one of them was ready to vomit. I am just wondering now if I should even look at amazon reviews because this is a second instance where i was disappointed by trusting the reviews. I would guess it was the problem with the batch i received or something had changed in this product to not to match the review I read here."
5,decadence made healthful,"Two of the most yummy, sinful flavors in one healthy package, who knew? Love it for the late afternoon pick me up when in fade mode! Thank you ZICO!"
1,Zico Coconut Water with metallic after taste,I have tried four different brnads of pure coconut water(not from concentrate or flavored). Out of the four I tried I think VitaCoco has the best fresh tasting flavour. After VitaCoco I liked the 'REAL' coconut water. I found Zico to be the worst tasting coconut water(it has a metallic after taste to it even when you drink it cold with ice). I will never buy Zico again. Going back to VitaCoco brand now. I see a lot of good reviews on Zico so I believe that it must be something wrong with the packing ? now that its soo hot in the North-east maybe something happened but I havent had this experience with other brands. All the best to anyone who is willing to try this brand.
3,"Quite Pleasant, Good Mixer","I just tried this flavor. Clear and cold with just a trace of flavoring and not too sweet - adult taste, not a kiddie juice drink. There is no strong coconut flavor or aroma.Zico makes a great novelty mixer (vodka & bourbon too) but seems a bit pricey for daily use."
5,"Delicious, pure coconut water","I was very pleased with this coconut water. It tastes fresh, pure and delicious. It's excellent for re-hydration, especially after sports, while pregnant, in labor, or just during the hot summer months.The tetra bottles are large, great for stashing in the refrigerator and using throughout the day.I typically buy another brand, but I'm glad I decided to try ZICO this time. The only ingredient in this particular item is coconut water, and it's not from concentrate."
2,some packs are good and some are bad,"I ordered 4 count of 12 packs ..and one pack was so good and pure..and some of them are spoiled..may be they are from spoiled coconuts..Zico should take care of these issuesZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)"
1,"Compared to ONE, Zico is way too inferior","Been using ONE for almost two months.. I really like it.. It has subtle sweetness like coconut water does and tastes fresh and natural.. Always makes me feel fresh..Saw that Costco start selling Zico. Compared to 17$ that I have been paying for ONE through amazon, 14$ from Costco for Zico sounded a deal as I will use two 12-packs per month and bought a 12-pack.First impression: Does not taste natural. It has distinct made-from-concentrate taste.. Not sure why when it says it is natural.. No sweetness like ONE does... infact no taste at all.. Does not leave that refreshing feel... Even my 5 year old daughter said the same thing after taking a sip. Not impressed..I will stick with 17$ ONE."
2,not straight from a coconut,The taste of Zico was growing on me and I really liked it but feel like I have been misled. Zico is now made from concentrate. I'm sure they mix it with filtered water and it's fine but it is not straight from a coconut as some of the other brands are. ie; I'm not going to buy orange juice from concentrate when I can get fresh squeezed for less!
4,Very different taste,"I ordered this looking at one show on TV which said this product has lot more vitamins and minerals as compared to other brands. I drink a lot of coconut water after exercising. When I tasted it for the first time, the taste of zico was weird; it tastes like plastic mixed with coconut water- but it does not actually have any plastic. It is just that the coconut water has a different taste. It is not sweet and tastes very bland. But after trying out 12 bottles, I found my older brand to be very sweet. My husband likes Zico better so I guess I am going to alternate the subscription between Zico and the other brand."
2,ZICO WATER IS GOOD BUT NOT IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER!,"I love drinking Zico's coconut water. In camparison to all others, I find ZICO's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as I'm from an Island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage. HOWEVER, their packaging certainly makes a difference DO NOT purchase ZICO's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience ""PLASTIC"". ZICO's carton packing is much, much better!!! ENJOY"
2,No More Plastic Bottles,"I wish I could say that I loved this. I really do. However, all I can taste is PLASTIC. I have no idea if the coconut water is decent or not because the taste of plastic container is SO overwhelming.It honestly tastes like a bottle of average water that has been left in your vehicle in the 100-degree heat for four days."
1,Has anyone tasted this stuff?,I am shocked that anyone would pay a whopping 2.50 a bottle for this stuff. It tastes horrible and I cannot imagine ever reaching for it to rehydrate myself for any reason. I know the benefits of coconut water but there must be one that tastes better than this!
2,"not great, good, or even tasty","I appreciate the electrolytes that this provides when I am exercising. Beyond the functional value of being liquid and providing nutrients, this drink has no redeeming characteristics that I could find."
1,bleah,"I liked the idea of an unsweetened drink like this, but the taste is off, and the ""texture"" is creepy."
3,somewhat short shelf life,"Rcv'd on 20/Nov/06 product w expiry date of 23/Jan/07. Two months is a shorter shelf life than I'd have liked. Is this the nature of the product? Or does AMZN have a slightly older stock than what would be available in retail channels like Costco? I'd appreciate if someone might please inform on the subject. ?.....PS. Cannot really max the stars mainly because the price is to me rather high for a beverage product, albeit an exotic. And anyway too, have not acquired yet a taste for this product. Just as y'all warned. It def ain't a love-at-first-sip."
2,Dr. D,Not as tasty as the mango or even the plain... flavors are very muted...and I didn't get a hint of passion fruit.. too bad
1,horrible synthetic taste,"I absolutely love the plain Zico Coconut water - I drink at least 1 or 2 of the large tetrapaks a week. I have also enjoyed some of the other brands Mango flavored coconut water (O.N.E. and Vita). So the logical progression was to try the Zico Mango.ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. You can't taste the Coconut, but instead are overpowered with this terrible synthetic tasting Mango flavor that leaves a disgusting aftertaste that almost ""stings"" the back of my tongue. Like I said before, I am almost addicted to coconut water, and I hate to let things go to waste - but I couldn't even finish this bottle.After looking at the ingredients - Coconut water from concentrate and Natural Flavors. I don't know what type of ""natural flavors"" they are using, or what constitutes a ""natural flavor"". Whatever it is, it's disgusting.I recommend trying one of the other brands coconut-mango mixes that actually adds small amount of Mango Puree."
1,"Artificial flavor, made from concentrate","I got hooked on coconut water while traveling in the Philippines. Since then I've been trying to find a packaged product that tastes like the real deal. There are a few decent brands out there. This particular product, however, is made from concentrate and tastes just like the plastic it is packed in. I didn't even finish the bottle."
1,Artificial and disgusting taste!,"for some reason, Zico seems to be the worst of the lot when it comes to coconut waters. Having come from a real coconut water drinking country (I mean coconuts off the trees), I know the difference in taste and Zico most definitely tastes like it is made of concentrate/extracts as opposed to being the real water! The only thing they have going for them are the number of celebrities they've managed to get hooked onto them!"
2,from concentrate,"After trying the O.N.E. and Vita Coco coconut waters, the Zico does not compare, it has a heavier taste, not the refreshing, light taste coconut water should have. The plastic resealable bottle is a plus, but the taste is what it comes down to. Until zico goes back to pure coconut water instead of concentrate, we will be purchasing the other brands."
1,From Concentrate - Tastes Bad,"We purchased a case of this so-called ""natural"" coconut water, took one sip, poured the remainder of that first bottle down the drain and returned the case for a refund. It tasted that bad.This stuff is not legitimate coconut water ... it's made from concentrate and has added flavors.Definately not recommended."
3,Plastic-Flavored Coconut Water,"So far, I've loved all of the coconut water brands and flavors I've tried, including Zico. However, this was the first one I tried in a plastic bottle and was disappointed to find that there is a little bit of a plastic flavor to it. Zico's great, but I'm definitely going to stick to the box from now and on."
2,FUNKY FLAVOR!,"I drink Coconut water all the time, and I remember in the past liking Zico, so I placed it on my subscribe and save since it was the cheaper brand offered...after receiving my first case and trying out my first pack, I immediately removed it from my subscription. This does NOT taste right, it has an almost soy-sauce flavor to it. I thought maybe it was that individual pack, NOPE! I've drank three of them and they all tasted this way. This past weekend I went to a music festival and packed some O.N.E. coconut water instead, much MUCH BETTER. My Boyfriend also tried some of the Zico, but out of trying not to be rude didn't say anything...this past weekend when he drank the O.N.E. he finally spoke up and said, no offense, but this is WAY better than that stuff you gave me last week..."
5,Naturally 100% Amazing!,"Zico Coconut Water is my absolute favorite! It's 100% natural and delicious. It's super powered water! It's what your body needs when you're thirsty, it's so refreshing!"
1,i want plain coconut water,"I like the coconut water plain it is the best thing that has happened to me as I was having leg cramps at night ,i am drinking one before bedtime and wow no more cramps!!"
3,Good but not great,"Not bad coconut water but doesn't come close to Nirvana (in bottles). They both originate from Thai coconuts but Nirvana has a much deeper, richer taste."
1,"I'm sorry, but it was awful.","I purchased this coconut water expecting it to at least be passable. What I got was a 12-pack that was 2 months away from expiration and tasted terrible. With so many other solid brands out there, I'm moving away from ZICO."
3,Zico's downfall,"I have been purchasing the Zico tetrapack for a couple of years now and was their biggest advocate. It was as close to good, fresh coconut as you get. The taste was so fresh, that I could honestly say that I could not distinguish between it and what I would buy back home. About 4-5 months ago, they changed something that affected their end product. It now tastes like all the other stale tasting coconut water. I don't know if it was a change in the way they produce the water, or if they changed where they got their produce from. In either case, I am sure that whatever they did saved them money. I am back to searching for a fresh tasting coconut water."
4,One of the best Cocowaters available,"This is a really good product, the flavor is not overwhelmingly sweet and it's very refreshing and light. It's perfect for a really hot day when other soft drinks feel like too much. I feel more hydrated and I think my skin looks better when I drink a serving every day. The case price is really a good value versus buying it at the store, check it out for yourself."
1,Smells like plastics,"Bought a 12 pack recently, once I open the pack it reeks of plastic, can't even take it near my mouth to drink.Had used Vitacoco from local grocery stores and they taste like fresh coconut water. Definitely this stuff is not natural."
4,A bit sweet.,"It is probably just nuts from a different country, but it is just naturally a bit sweet for my taste."
1,NO STRAWS!,"I don't particularly like the taste of coconut water, but I use it in my protein shakes for extra hydration and minerals instead of water. If you want to take these individual servings with you, beware... There were NO STRAWS attached to the drinks, nor were they in the box. Not sure how you are expected to drink from it. Heads up!"
1,Tastes very bad.,"Very bad taste, like rotten/stale drink. I had read pretty good reviews about ZICO coconut water, but on trying it totally disapointed. VITA COCO is way better than this."
2,"packaging seems good, changes to coconut water formulation not","Unfortunate that Zico natural coconut water was reformulated when this bottle was introduced. I like the convenience of the bottle, and find it easy to believe that the bottle is environmentally friendlier than the tetra pak, but the flavor of the coconut water is unpleasant--the kindest characterization I can come up with is ""flat"". Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging. A look at the nutrition information on the label makes it clear that there is a difference in the two products, though I haven't analyzed the changes. Will not be purchasing any more of this product."
1,Bad for Me,Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.Natural coconut water is better than concentrate.
3,Very acquired taste...,"I would strongly recommend tasting one of these before order a 12-pack, as this is a very acquired taste. I bought one pack at the local health food store as a trial, and it was one of the most horrible tastes I can remember in recent memory. So just don't go blindly ordering this or you may be sorry."
3,Love the product but packaging issues- BECAREFUL!!!,"I'm a total ZICO loyalist and buy at least 6 liters a week. I decided to purchase from Amazon since they deliver and those bottles are heavy to shelp up my stairs. I would give this 5 stars but 3 out of my 6 bottles had cap defects. The caps were starting to separate from the bottle which resulted in leakage and possible contamination.I've seen this in grocery stores as well, so I know it's not an ""Amazon"" issue. :(I notified Zico online- I guess we will see what happens.On a unrelated note.. Amazon you should have a spell check option within the review section..."
2,Not a good change,"I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn't made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico withNaked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12). It's as good as the old Zico was if not better."
1,Less Potassium per Ounce then the Boxes because it's not Pure,"I was fooled into getting this as BJ's because it was cheaper then the boxes, and there is a reason! It's not pure and it tastes like crap. It has a lot less Potassium in the 14 ounce bottom (569) compared to 700+ in the boxes that are 3 ounces smaller! Stick with the boxes, trust me!"
1,"Zico, not good anymore ..","I have purchased Zico and Vita-Coco multiple times from Amazon. I love Coconut Water and specially this 100% pure ones. But lately I have realized quality of Zico brand is not as good as it was before. I have had at least 100-110 individual packs so far but now I am feeling like watery taste (Am I saying they add water? ;) ) than coconut water.The only change I noticed, it was made it Brazil before and now its somewhere else ..My suggestion, stay away from Zico brand for now."
2,not so good,friend told me about product so i tried it like and did not like it so i gave it away just have to have the taste for it and i didnt wont be ordering this product in the future unless its for somebody else
2,The taste is bad compared to Naked Coconut Water,"I love Coconut water. I drink Naked brand all the time. I figured I'd try Zico but I realy didn't like the taste. Leaves a bad after taste. Try Naked, it tastes pure and natural."
2,does all the coconuts tastes the same????,Never - coconuts never taste the same. so how do these brands maintain a consistent taste. think about it. I read a review that this one is better than O.N.E and Vita. I would say none of them are better substitute than a natural coconut's water.
1,Potentially unsafe plastic type too,"First, I agree with the other reviewers about the ""off"" flavor and I am confused about why they decided to add ""natural flavors"" to coconut water that already tastes great by itself. We are big fans of coconut water and have replaced all other drinks with it at family and other social gatherings. But yesterday one of our family members pointed out the the bottles are plastic type #7 (unidentified plastics created after 1987, including the plastic type BPA!) and even more puzzling, the bottle lists another plastic type next to it saying its also a #2 plastic type but its HDPE compatible. Its so frustrating (and embarassing that I didn't catch it before putting in the coolers)!"
2,Yuck,I didn't like this brand of coconut water it has a strange after taste. There are other brands out there that are a lot better.
5,Satisfies my sweet tooth!,"I LOVE Coconut Water so when they came out with Chocolate Flavored Coconut Water, I was excited!This tastes to me a lot like nonfat chocolate milk but you get the added benefits of Coconut Water.I've been trying to lose a couple of extra pounds and whenever I get the urge for a late night snack or my sweet tooth sneaks up on me, I drink my Chocolate Coconut Water and it ALWAYS satisfies my craving for sweets!What a lifesaver!"
4,Chocococo,"I love coconut water... and I love chocolate and putting them together only seemed like a match made in heaven. The first time I tried it I became hooked but once you are 1/2 - 3/4 of the way through the 12pk I felt like I may have had enough of it and wanted just plain coconut water. I definitely like the chocolate flavor but it is more of ""I need to be in the mood"" type of thing rather than being able to drink it daily like I can with plain."
1,fake,"I am from Malaysia and I have lived in Texas for 11 of my 15 years. Back in Malaysia I drank and ate coconut on a weekly basis. I rode my bike to CVS yesterday and bought this drink. After I took one sip, I was like, WTF?! It tastes aweful!There is little to no coconut in there. Notice consumers, that it is only ""100% natural coconut WATER FROM CONCENTRATE"" and includes natural flavors. It tastes in my opinion more like barley water that coconut. The drink is very diluted and just fake overall. Now dont get me wrong, the average American may buy this product to make get a tropical feel or something, but they would only be wasting their money."
2,Ugh take it away please,"This is a review for the non-flavored zico. Plain and simple it tastes gross nothing like real coconut water. Take it from me, I had a coconut tree in my backyard growing up. Drinking it straight up is gross, it tastes synthetic and I don't know how people rave about it. Though, i did try mixing it in with my protein shakes and that was tolerable.ConclusionBuy another brand"
1,Bad quality - would not recommend,The coconut water smelled and tasted pretty bad. Amazon folks were gracious enough to issue a refund. I ended up throwing away all the 12 packets. Would not buy this brand again....
4,"Delicious, yet too high in sugar","This is probably one of the best flavored coconut waters out there. It tastes like skinny chocolate milk. If you are concerned about the level of sugar, though, you should stay away. It is has 18 grams per serving whereas most plain only has about 12. Although, if you drink it before or after a grueling Bikram practice, I think you deserve a little extra sugar."
3,I am converted,after a lifetime of thinking I didn't like coconut or coconut water (milk) I have changed my tune - this is not what you would expect and if you and your family are trying to become more health conscious and clean up the food that you are eating try this product - this is just one mom's opinion
1,Bad Product Update,"Zico used to be my coconut water of choice. When I first saw the new packaging I was excited that it would be easier to close and store. I was shocked when I tasted it - it is NOT the same product! The taste really turned me off. I've since switched to O.N.E. coconut water.I also determined that the new bottle size is too big of a serving. I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting."
3,Bland but Passible,Doesn't taste like a just opened coconut. Better tasting than Vita Coco though. Vita Coco is almost gross. O.N.E is the best I've tasted so far. I will be re-ordering O.N.E but not this.
1,Plastic tasting junk from concentrate with stuff added,"I don't write many product reviews, but this one struck a nerve. I love coconut water. And I've lived in Thailand for many years where it's a common drink so I'm pretty familiar with it.I was fooled by the fancy packaging of 'Zico'. This product is horrible. It has a distinctive plastic taste. I am not kidding. Further, it uses plastic #7, which means it is full of harmful BPA's. I ordered about 48 different bottles in 4 different flavors. I have to throw it out.Beyond the plastic, this stuff isn't even pure coconut water. It's from concentrate, then they add more stuff to it.Horrible horrible stuff. I'd recommend only buying 100% coconut water, period. There's plenty of options."
1,"With new, improved Tryopenin tab!","I like the product but it is too much trouble to open it now. I sent this email to Zico but, strangely, they didn't replyHi Folks,I like the product and I buy a couple cases per month of the 11oz units. I do have a complaint though: Why do you bother to put that silver tab on the top? I thought it was to open the box, but I guess it must just be there to protect the plastic membrane underneath. At any rate, I always have to have a knife around to cut the plastic out. You can't just punch a hole in it because the plastic then prevents the liquid from coming out smoothly. It has to be cut out. And that is almost impossible to do without spilling some. And it's a pain in the ass.Come on, guys. It's 2012 and I know there are some companies manufacturing containers that are easy to open. For what you are charging, shouldn't it be a little easier to enjoy your product?"
1,Discolored (yellow) !!!,"I've bought Zico many times before from Whole Foods, and I don't remember it being yellow! I started a subscription of this as well as the larger bottles of Zico. The larger bottles came with clear water as I'm used to; however, every single one of these 11.2oz ones poured out yellow water. NOT NORMAL. I know they had a recall of many of shipments, but that is long over and this is not a recall item. It should be! I would say, stay away from Zico, or if you must drink, buy individually from the store instead of these cases! I am cancelling immediately...and would return this order too if I could!!! (Now I just get jokes in my office about how they'd rather not be 'healthy' like me if this is what it entails!!!)"
1,Misleading information,"I usually buyVita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12), and was going to buy Zico (the name of a famous brazilian soccer player).The information on the product reads ""from Brazilian coconuts"", but if you take a look at the label (in the pictures) it clearly states ""imported from Thailand"".They are clearly trying to position themselves againstVita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12), by pretending to be from Brasil (using the soccer players name, and stating they use Brazilian coconuts) but in reality they are a Thay product.Nothing wrong with that, but they should not mislead people..."
5,Love it!,"Alot of people are trashing this product. I love it! It is my breakfast drink each and every day. And when I skip a day, I can tell. But Amazon will not want to hear this, but a case at Costco is only $17.99."
1,Not What I Expected,I guess I should have tried a bottle locally before buying a case. The consistency and flavor were awful. Not sure if this is what they all taste like but I will stick to my drink packets...
1,Weird Odor with a Bad After Taste!,"This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut. The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and it's not bad but it's better than this Zico. Zico does not taste fresh at all. If you don't breath, you can drink it down. I'm going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom; I hope she likes it! Ewww!"
2,Not impressed,"I am not impressed by this one compare to other coconut water products I tried, but taste is a subjective thing, you may like it so try it once."
5,Awesome!,My boyfriend and I both love coconut water and have been trying different brands for a while. We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!
3,Tastes oddly like watery skim milk...,"I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut."
3,"Okay, but not our favorite","In my family's three way taste test between Zico (from Thailand), Vita Coco (from Brazil) and Taste Nirvana (from Thailand), two of us ranked this #2 and one of us ranked it #3. It had a slight tart taste, not nearly as strong as Vita Coco's. Not nearly as...smooth and tasty as Taste Nirvana. We just don't like the ""bite"" that some coconut waters seem to have."
5,No Taste like Pure Coconut Water,"This coconut water from Zico is of the highest quality. The coconut water is free of any artificial ingredients. This coconut water is just what it claims to be, 100% coconut water. When chilled, it is so refreshing. It is high in Pottasium. I bought two cases of Zico coconut water on my first order and later wished I had bought more. When I opened each container of the Zico coconut water, I found no floating chunks, no residue at the bottom of the container, just pure coconut water, unlike the other brands that have only a small amount of real coconut water in their products. I used to go to the store and buy three or four coconuts at a time, and put up with stares and comments from the cashiers. Each one of these Zico coconut water containers has more inside than any coconut I ever bought, and I don't have to poke holes into them to get the coconut water out. I highly recommend this product."
3,Only good if it's offered for a fair price!,"Zico is a very mild green coconut water that lacks the sweetness of the Vita Coco brand. I mostly drink coconut water for the benefits so the specific taste range is broad for me. I don't like the floating prices on this site because when I purchased it, it was a good deal (especially coupled with free shipping). I've since seen the prices rise to almost double at times PLUS shipping sometimes which is severely unfair. I can find this at the supermarket so if it's not cheap enough here I'm not buying it. Bottom line!"
1,nasty,"I am from Jamaica, and I had coconuts straight from the trees and this does not taste natural at all, as a matter of fact this is the worst tasting coconut water I have ever tasted. I was very disappointed, Zico does not come close. I have to give VITA COCO FIVE STAR and this None."
3,Pretty good.,"I had coconut water when I was in the Philippines & loved it. So, I ordered this when I got home since I enjoyed it so much. Zico coconut water is pretty good, but not as good as the fresh coconut water I had previously, so I was slightly disappointed."
5,So Good!,My sister turned me on to these and I love it! Tastes so much better than other brands I've tried.
5,Extraordinarily refreshing,"I started drinking Zico after Bikram yoga class and I have never had anything pull me out of a post workout rut better than this coconut water. High in potassium, it keeps cramps at bay, as well. Make sure it's nice and cold to maximize the mild taste and refreshing qualities. I will never drink regular sports drinks again."
5,Tastes good,"Have tried zico and one both. I do not think there's much different in these two brands. None of them is as fresh as the fresh coco water, but I still liked both of them. Zico felt slightly better than one in taste."
2,Leaked packaging,I am a big fan of coconut water and use it instead of other sports drinks when I cycle. This package showed up quickly but some of the containers had leaked and the outside packaging had molded in spots. I will not being buying this brand again.
1,Beware of the spoiled ones,"I ordered this about a month or so ago, and out of the 12 packs, two of them were spoiled. I even accidentally swallowed a sip, yuck! They smelled pretty bad with a fairly dark color (compare to the normal ones).The other 10 packs were fine, except some of them were sour."
4,Better Than Expected Taste,"Overall, good taste but still leaves an after taste.Pros: Fast hydration. New flavors (Mango is the best thus far in my opinion). Low calorie.Cons: After taste especially towards the end or if warm. Formula has changed despite what Zico says."
2,Fermented Future,"I signed up for Zico 12-pack delivery after some comparison among similar products. It seemed liked a good deal. The first shipment last month was great-all 12 ""paks"" were consistent in flavor and clarity. This month, however, the contents have led me to cancel all future shipments.Upon opening the box, I noticed a wet spot on the top although it seemed intact and untampered. There seemed to be no additional leakage and the expiration date was NOV '11. The first pak I opened had brownish coconut water that I had never seen before. The next one was paler and less acrid. Overall, the observation is that the coconut water was probably from different batches since the individual paks were different shades and degrees of sweetness/ bitterness.Other reviews have reported that coconut water is bitter, so if you like bitter drinks (healthier?), then you should get this product. There is not a sure way to determine if it's Zico or Amazon at fault, so use your own discretion."
2,Vita Coco is way better,"Love coconut water, really don't like this brand, kind of tastes like plastic. Vita Coco and Naked is much better! Will never buy it again!"
2,Tastes like plastic,"I have bought the version in the boxes before, but thought the plastic bottles would be more convenient. Unfortunately it makes the drink taste like plastic. The plastic taste is very strong, and awful. Stick to the boxed type."
1,from concentrate!,This stuff is terrible. It has that concentrated and plasticky taste as if it's not fresh.
1,Who said this tasted like Yahoo???,My taste buds must be very different because believe me this does not taste like a yahoo......What a waste of money....
2,This tastes aweful,"Anyone who says this tastes like choc milk or Yoo Hoo is nuts. I had it over ice and could hardly get it down. I wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting. Delivery was not what I expected either. It came in a box with many other items, it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds. I think the UPS guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out. I guess the good news is it came quickly, along with the disappointment."
5,Zico Water is the Best!,"I used to get leg and foot cramps from doing hot room yoga. I drink one or two Zico waters after yoga, and I never get cramps! This is the only product that has helped after exercise. Now, even when I fast walk or run, I'll down a box of Zico water just in case!"
5,I want my Zico,"I've tried other coconut waters and prefer Zico. I actually prefer Zico in a carton to a can, but am not sure there's a difference. No coconut water I've tasted is AS good as the fresh stuff from a coconut, but Zico comes closest.. To my palate, others I've tried just don't cut it."
2,Drinkable but barely,This is better than the pomegranate flavor but just barely. The pure stuff is so much better. I'll be sticking to that.
2,Yuck! Better Packaging please!,"I received this package at my door today. I ordered it as part of the black friday subscription/save deal. I promptly cancelled my subscription. This arrived with the box holding the ZICO damaged within the shipping box. When I opened the box of Zico within I saw that several of my Zicos were already leaking out of their tetrapaks. Then, I tried one. They tasted like fish and sweet potatoes, but worst of all- it was sour. Yuck! Not at all like the Naked coconut juice. Go with that instead."
5,Truly nature's sports drink,"It takes an outstanding product to motivate me to write a review. November 2009, I am running south on Pacific Coast Highway as a participant in the Malibu half marathon. A smiling volunteer hands me a cup of liquid around mile 9. Wow! Refreshed, replenished and revitalized, I go on to run my best half marathon and win my age group. What was that magic stuff in the cup? ZICO coconut water! Mighty mighty good. Finally, a sports drink that is not high fructose corn syrup-based. This is the real stuff. I drink it daily. The amazon 12 pack monthly subscription is not enough. I need more ZICO!"
4,"Excellent coconut water, great packaging","This water is great, I prefer the normal flavor, but the Passion Fruit version is good too. This stuff is great after a workout or a bike ride. It is also a great prophylactic to prevent hangover (have one when you conclude consumption, and another when you wake up). It seems to replenish necessary minerals, etc., to give you a more pleasant recovery. The packaging is great, the boxes are simple to open and stay cold for a long time. The only drawback is price."
5,Awesome album,"I just want to say this is one of my most favorite albums of all time. The vocals, lyrics, and melodies are blended perfectly. They truly have a gift for speaking directly to your soul."
2,Sounds horrible!,"We bought this Piano because it was a special offer, not on Amazon. I regret not having read more about it in reviews, if I had, I would have bought a bigger keyboard for the same price and been happier. If my daughter didn't like it, and the reviews about returning the Item weren't as bad as they are, I would send it back."
1,cute piano but horrific odor,"This little toy piano is adorable. Unfortunately, when I opened the box I was shocked by an awful odor---it smelled like a powerful insecticide. I removed all the parts from the box and put them out on my screened porch for a few hours. This did not help.I would NEVER give this piano to my grandchild."
1,Too many stats..not enough suggestions,"I was looking for a book to help an adopted 4 year old boy not lie. This book was filled with stats, but not really real world tactics I could use now. I would much more recommend 'The Connected Child' by Karen Purvis and Parenting with Grace by Popcak."
5,Book,New book that arrived on time. I wanted to read some of Dr. Paul Ekman's books and this is a great started. He really goes into detail about lying from children and what motivated them for lying.
3,Not up to expectations,"Thought Doves would go through the roof for seed meant for them by name but not so, they pick through and eat little."
3,Mimi Rogers in family drama film..,"Mimi Rogers plays Pat Bogen, the new superintendent of a small coal mine in West Virgina. On her first day on the job, her husband and son are trapped inside a mine, (her son and husband both work in the mine). They are trapped due to drilling which hit a water reservoir, causing the mine to fill with water.Pat, along with her father, who is a veteran of the mine himself, race to save her husband, son and the other miners and get them out of the mine safe and alive.* family friendly drama"
3,Great bargain,This was a great bargain and its in pretty good condition and arrived promptly.Gamecube games are still very much in use and my sons enjoy this game
3,cant enjoy it for long,this game is extremely fun but i only enjoyed it the first time i played cause i finished it in an hour get this game expecting to return it the next day. i was never challenged. dont think i hated the game i actually loved it but it should be much harder and longer. i now do not own the game but am planning to get madagascar 2 it might be better and more challenging get the game but dont expect to keep it for too long.
3,True To The Movie,"Im Kinda Old To Be Playing This Game, But I Do Anyway! Me And My Sisters (27-35) Play It Together Sometimes And We Always Laugh And Have Fun With It. It Is Easy To Beat Tho, Not Much To It. So It Would Be Best For Kids Under 12. But Let Me Tell You This! The Mini Games Are A BLAST 4 ANYONE!!! My Whole Family Play The Mini Golf All The Time, We Love It!"
5,The game was great fun.,I got this game for my 4 year old he loved it. My 10 year old nephew thought it was a breeze though.
5,Best kid game ever!,I bought this game for my sons 5th Birthday. It is such a fun actionfilled game. It is just like the movie. My son loves it. I do too.
5,Fun and Funny,"Madagascar, the movie, is known for how funny it was, well, the game was fun to play, and funny to watch! There were a lot of funny parts, which stopped me from wanting to skip it, you know how it is with most games, you want to get right to the action and skip when the characters talk, well the funny antics of these run-away animals from Central Park Zoo, Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman, make the parts where the characters talk, just as fun as the game! This is a really good game!"
1,Just a Bad Movie the alternative title!,"Okay, I just finished watching this movie. It began nice and dark which I love with a few twisted characters but it never got good. It went from twisted to sick and finally just pointless. I would recommend seeing this with a group of people lots of alcohol and no regrets about losing an hour and a half or so of your life.Enjoy."
3,This is just...,"Okay, I'm not saying the movie is stellar. I'm not saying the acting was even that great (quite frankly, it wasn't) But if you're looking for an EXCELLENT batch of dry humor and some funny incidences within a film that actually should've gotten praise for it's LACK of emotion, this is for you. I found it quite hilarious the first time around, and plan to buy in on DVD, if for nothing else than the occasionally laugh."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw Bats, starring Lou Diamond Phillips IN THE THEATRE. That was two hours of my life that I will never get back. I could go into detail, but it just isn't worth it."
3,better get drunk,"this is a weird movieits funny cause its so random, weird, and stupid.if you're in the mood for something like this ... or if you're drunk ....or if you're just as weird ..."
3,Great Spatula bad sticker,I love the spatula but the sticker that was on it has some glue that I could not get off for the life of me. I washed it 4 or 5 times. Soaked it in warm water. Scrubbed it...scraped it...rough scrubbed it...and still no luck. The rubber glue from the sticker would not come off. I had to take the spatula out into my garage and sand it will sand paper to get the glue from the sticker off. I had to sand it for 5 min as well. What a pain! If I would have known this glue/sticker was going to be this much trouble to remove I wouldn't have bother buying the spatula.
5,Fine spatula,"This spatula is great for all types of cooking. I appreciate it for Asian-style cooking, where quick actions are needed. Being made out of bamboo allows this spatula to achieve that, while preventing scratches to Teflon coated pans. It's highly washable and has some sort of varnish that I wouldn't worry about getting into my food. Easily washed with soap and water. Doesn't warp, either (so far; I've used it for several months now)."
1,torture,"This may be a classic within its culture but, in this translation at least, the monotonous and relentless listing of random details is like water torture."
1,For completists only. Try another Francis comedy first.,"This final ""Francis the Talking Mule"" opus features a different leading comic (Mickey Rooney), a different director (Charles Lamont), and even a different voice for Francis (Paul Frees). All are usually capable of good comedy, but they can't do much with an unfunny script. There's a good chase climax at the end, but you have to sit through the first hour to see it. Not worth your time unless you have to have all the Francis movies. Try an older one first."
4,Road to Rouen,"Supergrass' ""Road to Rouen"" snuck out late last year with little to no warning or fanfare. I'm lucky I found it!I've been a big Supergrass fan for awhile. So it's nice to see the band ""grow up"" and mature on this record. The overall sound on this album is a lot fuller than their previous work.Road to Rouen feels like one of those 70's concept/art albums. It has a great, solid feel and atmosphere throughout. It doesn't get too young/goofy/corny like they've been know to do in the past (which may or may not be a good thing).Either way, I think it's a great album. It is only 9 songs long, about 33 minutes long, which is one complaint. It's still worth picking up."
3,3-1/2 stars -- Get lifted,"Supergrass is another one of those unfortunate bands that tends to get lost in the shuffle of all the other music out there. A lot of people would probably only remember them from that eye-popping Hammer & Tongs-directed video they had for ""Pumping On Your Stereo"". At any rate, the boys do a pretty decent job on their latest EP, Road to Rouen.I really don't think the album is as great as some of these other reviewers claim, though. I mean, they can still play, and ""Roxy"" and ""Low C"" are above-average, but nothing else really stands out; to be honest, this album contains a lot of three-and-a-half-star songs. Another thing is that some of the songs have too much music and not enough actual singing.While Supergrass didn't lay a brick with this album or anything, they'll have to do a tad better than this to get more consumers to notice them. But if you're already a fan of theirs, they didn't stray away from their style, so feel free to pick it up.Anthony Rupert"
5,Long time to get here....,"I also have been lucky enough to get my hands on this before the US release. As a long, long time fan of this band i continue to wonder how they fly so far under the radar, as oasis, blur, coldplay etc. get so much atention. Sure, i love the grass's more rocking numbers from past albums as much as the rest of you, but this cd's more mellow feel is just fantastic. Mid to late era beatles and the trippy acoustic electric side of zeppelin are splashed all over this disc, just check out the opening track. This is fine work, perhaps their best to date. I do not like to write long reviews, so as a summary of perhaps the finest english band of the last 15 years....put it in your cart now!!!"
2,Inexpensive Supplement to Needlework Library -- Motifs,"This is an interesting book in that there are very few photos of the completed pieces - only the photos you see on the front and back covers (photos printed on inside of covers, too)! The book is filled with hand-drawn black-and-white charts on 10ct grid, three to five charts per page. Similar motifs are grouped together. There is a symbol key with color suggestions, but no DMC or Anchor numbers. The designers encourage you to experiment and substitute colors.Most of the charts are fairly simple in shape and color scale. They are sweet, but not cutesie. When I use the book, I make several working copies and color the symbols in with colored pencils to get a feel for how the finished design will work. This is an inexpensive and interesting way to get a variety of motifs to stitch, and may be useful as a supplement to your stitching library."
4,Brilliant fun!,Great for girls around the age of 7 - 11. Molly is a trooper and the kind of kid you love to see on TV instead of the usual Disney channel role models.... highly recommend for an afternoon on the couch with mom!
4,molly an American girl,"This movie was better than the felicity and samantha movies but wasn't as good as the chrisssa movie. some things are different in the movie than in the books, but it was still a pretty good film. but if you aren't sure about it, try renting it at the library. :)"
5,A wonderful film,This was a wonderful film of life during the war for young people. Some of the challenges and hardships of life on the home front. These films are realistic with out being gory. Good history for young children and their parents.
2,Slow and Disappointing,"This movie wasn't sure what to do. It didn't have very good relations to any of the books. Maya Ritter wasn't the best choice for Molly, even though she looked the part. In the books, Molly is very cheerful, but not in the movie. The best parts had the Emily and Mr. McIntire in them, because they did a fantastic job of portraying their parts. After the terrific Samantha and Felicity movies, this was disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"I had gotten this as a Christmas gift for a granddaughter who LOVES Molly. She was very excited about being able to watch a movie about her favorite doll. Unfortunately, the video would not play. I ended up having to order another one."
3,My review of Molly,"It is hard to rate this product since I haven't viewed it yet, but I will base my rating on the condition in which it arrived and the time frame in which I received it. I haven't played the movie yet since it is a Christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter. The product arrived in the mail fairly quickly, but I thought I had ordered a brand new movie and discovered that the original wrapping was not on it, leading me to believe that maybe the movie had been used. I can't say what the quality of the movie is at this point since we haven't watched it yet, but I hope the quality is good and that maybe for some reason the wrapping was removed, yet the movie plays like new."
5,Molly American Girl DVD,Another good video from American Girl Company. Molly shows us some of what Americasn went through on the home front in WWII>
3,Stupid-Compared to the books,This movie is not very good compared to the wonderful books. They cut 3/4 of the books and added a bunch of stuff that wasn't so great. The other two American Girl movies were better.
3,doesn't live up,"Having enjoyed the two American Girl movies before her I was excited to try Molly's...and it wasn't as great. The Samantha and Felicity movies stayed true to the books they are based off of; Molly's falls short of the mark there. So many things from the books are missing that it's just a disappointment. As others have said, Molly's brother Brad is not here, Mrs. Gilford is a neighbor instead of the housekeeper, and Emily plays a much bigger part than in the books (which was only one book). Overall, this is still a good movie: it shows the time period very well and the addition of Emily shows the cultural differences. If that's what you're looking for watch this movie. If you're looking for the same quality as the other American Girl movies, where there is the same storyline as the books, don't."
3,Good shirt except not silk-screened,"These are very good shirts in many ways. The shirt itself is good quality. The graphic is very good, but it was not silk-screened on. It appears to be some type of rubberized heat-transfer. It has a rubberish feel and is raised slightly from the fabric. I have had shirts with this type of image in the past and they do not wear well. I think the heat of the dryer causes the rubber to crack and peel.If these were silk-screened, I would give them at least a 4."
3,Corsican Brothers,"This movie was okay however, I thought the movie would be more like the other ones they have out."
1,"Unbelievably tedious, boring, and awful","This movie is one of the worst that I have ever seen. If it were a little better, then it would be funny because it is so bad. It's even worse than that. It has achieved my rating of ""Unbelievably tedious, boring, and awful."""
1,The WORST Cheech and Chong movie!,"I think this was the last movie by Cheech and Chong, and it's a good thing that it was if this is the quality of movies they were reduced to releasing.I mildly enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, but I recently rewatched it and was left asking myself, ""was I stupid enough to have once enjoyed this?""Horrible, horrible, horrible! In fact, I don't know what business this movie has being in the 'comedy' section. There are more laughs in ""Schindler's List"" than in this!"
5,cheech and chong corisan brothers,great movie great quality cheech and chong are super in all their movies great purchase
4,COOL MOVIE MAN,"THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AND WILL KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED, allthough it isnt one of there better Movies, it is still pretty Cool,I recommend you buy all of there Movies, Cheech and Chong Rulez."
3,Great comedy!!,This picture is a classic!!! I would think the studio that produced the film would put the video back on the market!! I would buy a couple copies today if they were available.This was Cheech & Chong's at their best.
1,"IF 9TH CENT. tEXANS COULD SPEAOK THIS WAY, THEY WOULDN'T","wHAT HAPPENS WHEN A YOUNG WRITER ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE MECHANICAL IAMBICS OVER THE VOICES AND ESPERIENCES OF PIONEER FARMERS IN tEXAS? a JACKBOOtED MARCH ACROSS ARID LAND, TRAMPLING ALL LIFE INTO DUST. tHE mfa TRAIN GOES MYSTICAL-HISTORICAL -- ALMOST."
5,Fabulous but short,This is a wonderful CD that will easily put you in a great mood with its charm and energy. But be aware that it's only 33 minutes long.
5,Tati: sweetness and colour,"The music of the films of Jacques Tati is always remarkable. Tati was a master of the sounds and in his films they are always very well done... including the music.Little known composers made these wonderful leit-motivs that we will never forgot. Now in this exceptional edition, all this delicious music is avaiable, with an extraordinary sound quality (in STEREO) and extracted from the soundtrack of the original films!!This item is an obligation for Tati's fans. A jewel."
5,VERY GOOD SVU BOOK!,"""One Last Kiss"" was a good book but it was also very sad. When Gin-Yung Suh was dying, Todd felt he had to stay with her every moment. I think Jessica should not interfere with her boyfriend's(Nick Fox) job becaus she gets into alot of trouble. All in all, it was a very good book."
5,THE BEST SVU EVER!!!!!,"This was definatly the best SVU book I ever read!!! It showed you such a different (and better!!) side of Todd. Even though I was crying from about the first chapter, I literally couldn't put this book down!!! When Gin-Yung actually dies it's sooo sad!!! IT was really different from any other SVU book..more emotiomal!!!!!! EMAIL ME IF think the same way too!!!!!!"
4,Total confusion!,"I was somewhat dissapointed whit this book, I know this is sadistic, but I kept waiting for Gin-Yung to die witch made things kind of borring, I loved it when Jassica apeared in Nick's stakeout, I mean, does that girl ever think of the consequences of the things she does?? As for Tom I think he deserved to suffer for Elizabeth, I mean I suffered with her when they broke up and I know just how she felt. Oh just one more thing! Where do the characters of these books get the tears to cry so much??? I've never seen anything like it! I thing that the exagerated crying makes the books look to irealistic, but what can I say... I'M A COMPLETE ADDICT OF THE SWEET VALLEY COLECTION!"
3,Get the Sony set instead,"I like Bernstein's Mahler very much, but find the freshness of the original Sony set much more palatable. Other than a few places in #5, the ensemble is fantastic (...the NY Phil of that time was a phenomenon of an orchestra and that Sony set reflects that). If there were no Sony set, this would probably be a 4 or 5 star set, because it does boast many first rate performances, including a 1 and 5 that are superior to the Sony set. But the Sony set offers better performances (to a greater or lesser degree) for the rest, including what perhap the finest 3 and 7 anywhere. The sound on the Sony set is fine throughout, not modern sound but very clear and lifelike (and better than the New York recordings in the DG set - 2, 3, and 7).So buy the Sony set, #5 from this set, and the newly remastered Das Lied with Fischer-Dieskau and Bernstein on Decca, and you will have all the best of Lenny's Bernstein... rather than spending considerably more for less with this set."
4,Great item for the price,I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com. It was easy to put together and looks/works great! The little table part is very funky and handy!
5,Great text for path residents,One of the most difficult parts of starting a path residency is knowing what is normal. This book is perfect as a review book and also during the residency.I have reffered to it many times and feel it is an indispensible part of a pathologists library.
4,Funny,All-Starts means exactly that. I thought it was a good CD for the price and I enjoyed watching it also.
3,The plot is a little disappointing.,"The story opens with an announcement that Hollywood is releasing a film about Pokemon. But we are never told very much about the movie. This announcement seems to be a mere pretext to reunite Meowth with his former acquaintances.Moreover, I cannot understand why the book is not better illustrated. Instead of illustrations which relate directly with the story, we are to be satisfied with already existing pictures of Pokemon characters."
3,Grammatical/Spelling Error in book!,"This book is colorful and sturdy. The ""feely"" pieces are good quality. The only problems with book is one grammatical error (one of the pages has ""Fishes leap"" as a sentence. The plural of fish is fish, not fishes)and the story is extremely short. Other than that, it's a great book for any child that loves Clifford as much as my 19 month old."
1,DANGEROUS JUNK,I plugged the fan in and the blades came flying out of the frame right at me. I could have been VERY seriously injured with a 120mm fan. I see it is now unavailable. They probably hurried and pulled it before someone lost an eye.Antec is supposed to be quality especially for a $26 fan. That is obviously dubious. I won't buy another Antec fan again. STOP MAKING CHINESE JUNK WITH NO QUALITY CONTROL.
4,"Quality purchase - Not by ""Lindsay"" - by STEVE","This set is quite good. I've only had it for a few weeks but have gotten much use out of it already. The theology is not always biblically accurate, probably because some of it if not all of it is written from a Covenant Theology perspective. The way that the various writers write, helps to not spoon-feed the reader. I have several commentaries that are like that. This one helps the reader to think and come to your own conclusions. Not as good historically as William Barclay or John Phillips, but still very good. Not as application driven as Jon Courson or Warren Wiersbe, nevertheless, still relevant. I would get it, if you are serious. From what I have read, the passages are extensive, so if you are looking for just a quick insight, forget this one, this would be for those seriously hungry for the Word. If that is you, I suggest you get out your shovel, get your Bible, and dig in!"
5,Can't get enough...,My 9-year-old can't get enough of this series. These books are well-written and even enjoyable for me when I read aloud to my son.
2,eh!!,"Better than the last one. Again still funny how the most feared bounty hunter in many galaxies has yet to fire a hand blaster , but is able to defeat 2 well known and feared killers. Come on!!!!"
3,Nice story about Bobas first meeting with Jabba,"These stories are written for 8 to 12 year olds, and 50 somethings who are star wars nuts like me. The 3 star is for the genre, as it seems to be of average quality to the other young persons books I have read and enjoyed.I thought the review from the young man from arlington heights hit all the key points of the story. I worked in palatine for 18 years, keep reading and writing, MTFBWY."
2,A hot commodity,Let me just put it this way: The Willy Evans Trio CD is so popular in this neck of the woods that it is the #1 choice of tunes to be stolen from the Mariner North Resort. The music is enough to heat up a frigid Northwoods night. The blues ain't just for Southerns...
3,I liked Diomede's work with Solar Circus better.......,"There's a reason why Mark Diomede and company still play a lot of the old Solar Circus songs with the band Juggling Suns, and that's because those were (and still are) great songs. Still, while this live Juggling album is a nice addition to your jam-band collection, I would have to recommend the following trio of albums in it's place to understand the true greatness of Mr. Diomede and Solar Circus, pre-Juggling:(1) Solar Circus: Juggling Suns; (2) Solar Circus: Twilight Dance (Live);(3) Solar Circus: Step Right Up"
4,awesome improve music for the mind,"This band is outragous live, i'm a big phish fan who has been to many shows, but i'd rather go to a juggling show"
5,Body Builders,"This book puts weight loss in a perspective that I've never heard before. In order to honor God we need to take care of our ""temples"". What a concept!!! Thank God for Leslie Nease!!"
1,"Poorly written, random digressions, and very boring","When Rain Clouds Gather has to be one of the most boring books I've ever read. The structure is way off as the author randomly describes different parts of the story that have long been forgotten or are irrelevant. Descriptions of characters, places, and background information occur way too often, sometimes taking up more than half of each chapter.The story also switches focus randomly and way too often with no transitions and characters pop up out of nowhere. Most of these characters have no relation to the main story and I feel that they were just added in to make the book longer (for some stupid reason).When Rain Clouds Gather is incredibly boring and I'm sorry to say that I would NOT recommend this book to ANYONE."
5,Amazing how good the pictures look off my inkjet,"I bought a couple different sizes of the HP Adanced Photo paper and I am using it on a 80 dollar HP inkjet. WOW these pictures look amazing! I really can't believe these photos came off my little inkjet. Depending on the photo I am having trouble setting it up correctly to fit on the 5x7 or 4x6 without either chopping some of the photo off or leaving a line at the bottom. But that has nothing to do with the paper, just the types of images I am trying to print off. Overall this is excellant paper that makes cheapy inkjets turn out amazing photos."
4,Great for photos.,"Bought 3 pack of 100 to make use of my new printer, so far so good. The price is okay and the quality is good. It certainly is good to keep handy when you want to add to your photo albums."
5,Better than Premium!,This paper is formulated to be fade and waterproof when used with the correct inks. Fast drying and long lasting photos make it superior to premium papers!
4,No complaints here,A good compromise between regular photo paper and premium photo paper. Good enough if you don't need the full quality deal.
3,Prefer the premium for color.,"I have always used HP premium plus and been satisfied. Tried this because of the quick dry-time. It does dry quickly, but the colors are not as rich and close to the digital image as the Premium Plus. Next time, I will go back to Premium Plus."
5,Best Glossy paper for my Canon,"I am using a Canon MP560. This paper has deeper black, better contrast, more accurate color, and smoother finish than the actual Canon brand papers. It also seems to be more durable and costs less. I've replaced all my Canon paper with this HP advanced, as it is just a lot better. All you have to do is tell the Canon that it is using ""Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy"" and it comes out perfect.My only complaint is all the markings on the back side of the paper. Lots of arrows and lines. Not a dealbreaker, but I wish they weren't there."
3,Okay,"It came with the printer, but I don't know why it came as a package deal. It doesn't fit in the printer."
5,Fast shipping work great,These came faster than expected and work great. I originally ordered these for my mother in law who says they work great. I will be ordering some for myself soon
4,Got it!,"The box the actual paper was a little beat up... but the product was well packed and I was able to successfully use the glossy photo paper right away. I love it. Thanks, Rebecca"
4,Good Photo Paper,"The photo paper is a quality product that makes brilliant photo copies with no bleeding of colors. I don't like the cheap plastic bag it comes in, i would prefer a box. However, it was a good bargain and I will probably purchase it again by brand name. Also, photos do curl a little."
2,My Mistake. Disappointment in paper size.,"I was disappointed in my receipt of 4 x 6 sheet size photo paper. I did not concentrate on the specs carefully enough and lo and behold I am now he proud owner of 100 sheets of photo paper which I use very infrequently. Lesson learned, all things are not what they may seems to be. If a price appears too good, check again, the item may not be the one for which you are looking."
1,hp glossy paper,p;rinting a picture in color was a smeared .picture. i printed using regular paper and it was ok.. cant use it and had to throw it away...very much surprised never expected it from hp paper....
2,It dose't work,I bought this paper because I couldn't get to dry on my other paper so I figured with advanced paper it was the the paper it would work but it didn't work.
3,Insufficient information in product description,"A description of the Kindle edition of this book is insufficient. It mentions a book and CD disks with audio materials for this language course - obviously copied from the physical product description. Does the Kindle file we can purchase here contain only the text portion, or does it include audio files (in MP3 format or Audible) as well?If anyone purchased this as Kindle edition, please comment and let us know. Or Amazon staff, please update the description of this Kindle edition."
4,Barbie Hamper,"A lot bigger than I thought it would be. Kind of heavy, but holds a lot of dirty clothes. My daughter loves the huge barbie on it and the fact that she can close the top."
3,"Good But, needs some work","The Barbie hamper is big..!! and my daughter loves it but, the closure won't work properly so the hamper won't stay close. Needs to improve..!!"
5,The best excitement ever for Jupiter 2 crew!,This was the very first episode I saw when I was eight years old! Seeing the Jupiter flyby around the derelict and it's entrapment was super cool! Hearing the unique ISD drive engine sound was the coolest ever sound effect of its kind! This trilled me the most! Interestingly how the plot of this episode ended up in the released movie. No doubt the writer must have liked this episode too. All Lost In Space fans must get this one for the fact that it displays the crew of the Jupiter 2 do what they do best...survive!!
4,Good Abstract-Hip-Hop-Soundtrack cd,"I think there's something wrong with the upper review... What you will find in this cd is a collection of slow motion abstract hip hop for a ""virtual"" Soundtrack, and very very very Dark, with strange and mysterious effects. It's coming from Kevin Martin, one of the guys of Techno Animal, and if you like this Stuff aswell as Dj Krush, or Dj Shadow you wont be dissapointed."
3,Month of Meals: Old-Time Favorites,If I had not bought the prior Month of Meals it would have been a good cook book.I had purchased the other two and in this one there were duplicate receipes and only a few new ones.My recommendation would be; Purchase this one if you have not purchase one and two Month of Meals.
5,Teach yourself about your DIabetes,"while I no longer am required to take oral medications for control of my blood glucose, I have found that the insights brought forth in all of the ADA's month of meals cookbooks to be very educational. the substitutes and mixes of foods helps control not only your daily numbers, but offers very reasonable and palatable foods that helps the diabetic control their food issues. The book offered good eating selections for me. Nothing like an A1c at 5.5 or below."
2,not feeling like a PIMP,"I purchased a case of this over a year ago. I still have two left. It's not very good. While I have come to respect Nelly as one of the greatest artists of our time, as a beverage producer, he leaves much to be desired.The drink is a scary neon green, and while it's not terrible (I haven't thrown the remaining two out), it isn't particularly good. It is tart tasting and not in a good way. I didn't feel properly pimped out after downing a can of the juice. I'm a big red bull and energy drink fan, and it looks like I'll have to continue shelling out dosh for the good stuff."
5,Great Stuff,Great product! I just think all energy drinks are overpriced. This one is not as bad as some. Product has good taste kind of like a sweet tart. Good kick. Beats the hell out of a red bull. Not as good as a 180 from the Budweiser Co. I have tried over a hundred different E-drinks and this is a pretty good one over all.
1,PIMP Juice????,"It's just a typical energy drink. I don't care if you think it tastes like a $200 glass of Champagne, do you really want to walk around with a can called Pimpjuice?I mean, if you are actually a pimp, please indulge yourself. If you are NOT a pimp, I'd recommend sticking to other energy drinks and saving at least a modicum of dignity and self-respect.What's next, an exclusive line of Hojuice or B(insert some more letters here)juice?"
1,WTF? Pimp Juice?,"Personally, I shudder to think of what the ingedients are in Pimp Juice. Hopefully they fall short of bodily fluids which is what immediately sprang to mind. I think they missed the mark here with the packaging. Shouldn't they be 40oz cans and come with a special promotional pink velvet hat?"
5,"a rare, honest performance","To those of you who think they know Brassens's songs and can hum them any time from shower to shower, this CD is more than a resfresher. Brassens brings his own guitar talent to a band of highly-skilled jazz musicians - the piano, trumpet and guitar sounds are just breathtaking. Rythms are revisited to make you dance on Brassens now, and to the jazz lovers this CD will be a passionate illumination on what a genial and bizarre song-writer could do in jazz too. This CD will never leave my home!"
1,Do not waste your money.,"Mine broke after a month and neither Logitech or where I purchased them would back them and now I have broken junk,I have since purchased the new Koss Colbalt bluetooth headphones that are only on the Koss website for now and they are twice what these are,and have a lifetime no questions asked warranty on them.The colbalt are better sounding and have better range and they also come with a computer bluetooth usb audio dongle and USB charging cable, AC charging adapter, and audio extension cable and the Bluetooth audio transmitter,also they can work with bluetooth cellphones that play music like the Razr V3x because they have a built-in microphone so you can take calls.They are the best!"
4,Logitech wireless Headphones,I do enjoy my wireless headphones and they are great to listen to music or watch a movie. The only complaint that I have is after a couple of hours of wearing they begin to hurt my ears. Your time will be limited to a certain amount of time.I enjoy having them and I would buy them again but I would have liked them to have been more comfortable to wear for a longer period of time.A very good product otherwise.David Buitt
2,"Great concept & customer service, poor manufacturing","This wireless headset is great in concept, but has been manufactured poorly. The band behind the head cracks easily (mine cracked in the first 2 weeks of use) and then won't stay on your head. Logitech stands behind their products, however, and will send a replacment headset if you have manufacturer defects in the first 2 years."
1,Waste of money,Piece of crap. Handband broke like everyone else's and Logitech made it way to difficult for trying to contact/get replacement. Wound up throwing them away....go for the Motorola Rokr S9 - much BETTER product.
3,"Works fine, but odd design.","I've been using my headphones at work for a few days now. They seem to work great. The biggest complaint: the design of the headphones doesn't fit my head. I honestly don't know what product engineer thought of the product design, but it doesn't work. Trust me, I have a small head. Some other reviewers mention that they've broken their headband--I read that review before I purchased the product, but now I can see why. And since I'm wearing these at work for long periods of time, they start to hurt my head because of the design. I've generally been really happy with all Logitech products I've bought. Like I said, the product works great--I haven't had any issues with the headphones working. But I can't for the life of me figure out why they made the product with a headband that's probably big enough to fit a 3-year old's head. Really odd."
2,does not work,i can not get it to work. i have e-mailed and asked for help with no response. so i guess i will be returning it. if i get it to work or the seller helps me i will amend this post. as it stands though i give it 2 stars. they did ship it quickly and it was packaged well.
1,THESE SNAP!!!,"I read reviews before that said these headphones snap down the middle but I figured these people had large heads/weren't careful, etc. THAT IS NOT TRUE. I am very careful with these headphones and one day I noticed they were way too loose. So I took them off and noticed that they were started to snap down the middle. I glued them with super glue but that wore away and they stopped working all together. I tried regluing them but they are very fragile now and now much use to me since I wear them while working out. These are WAY too expensive to have such a major defect. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,Poorly thought out,"I have been able to thwart the hairline cracks and breaking band with tape. That is fine.However, these headphones act like a hyperactive child. The non-stop loud beeping has made them basically unusable to me. They beep when you turn them on and then don't actually come on (with another beep) until you actually play something. They beep every 20 seconds when there is nothing playing -- even though they automatically turn off. They beep when being turned off.I've contacted Logitech tech support and they have confirmed that there is no way to disable this beeping. They are now at the bottom of my desk drawer, forever.Update: I wish I could downgrade these to 1 star. The beeping is incredibly annoying, and adds an extra little bit of stress and misery to my workday every time I use these headphones. I hate them!"
3,"It isn't the writing , it is the material, I dislike","The idea that an inspiring English teacher beloved by many studentswould conspire with a monster in order to become richis just the trashing of an icon? The sexual libedo William Bradfieldis one of the major topics of this book: how he deceived a lot of women:how he lead a gang of younger people to acts that ended inn the deathof three people. The Dr. Jay Smith character is just creepy, if a trueperson. Although not exactly a mass murder, he is just a very strangeperson whose motivations seem evil.I guess it is that I find no ground where these people seem to have complete human motivations even in self-deception?"
3,Not Really Fiction,"...the story presented by Wambaugh is a fascinating character study. Read it, and draw your own conclusions. As a back up you should try reading Engaged to Murder where another author interviews both defendants! ! . The lies of both are nicely showcased."
3,It's OK for some free time,"I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't anywhere near Wambaugh's other greats. The book gives an interesting insight into the psychology of a man who is manipulative, irrisistible to women, devoted to Ezra Pound, a staunch conservative and Catholic, and ultimately a vicious murderer. The story was a page-turner. The metaphores & similies & hyperboles becomes tiresome after #400 or so."
2,A must-read if you went to Upper Merion.....,"I went to Upper Merion, the school where all this nastiness took place. When these books were released and the requisite mini-series came out, a number of the characters were my teachers. If you know the people, it is interesting to see the liberties taken in the way they are portrayed.... and if you are looking for a handbook of trite and cliche detective lingo, this book is for you. It is a shame that this horrible crime was not documented by a book of better quality, but what are you going to do? It is an inexpensive book and worth exactly that price."
4,Great - but there are facts . . .,"This book has been a favorite of mine for years ... wonderfully written, even moving. But Wambaugh should have let the readers know that he paid Holt a substantial sum of money for his cooperation, and certainly the book should NOT be sold without an update that reports Smith's victory on appeal, when the courts found such massive prosecutorial misconduct that the state was forbidden from retrying him. I urge readers to also read Bill Costopoulos's book on the case."
2,not well-written,"I can't really evaluate the topic since it's all true, but I found the author to be a bit too wordy for my personal tastes and I did find the book slow (due to his writing style, not the topic). This surprised me because apparently he is a best selling author. Also, I was a bit put off by the author's sarcasm, I didn't feel it was appropriate given the weight of the story and it felt disrespectful to the deceased. As a forensics buff I enjoy true crime. The story itself was downright bizarre, but it just goes to show you anything can happen in this world; there is so much evil out there."
3,"Fiction, total fiction","This book is a good read, but Wambaugh tries to sell it as non-fiction, when it is really fiction. In real-life, the accused were aquitted on appeal after it was discovered that the police, DA and others manufactured and planted evidence. . . and Wambaugh, ex LAPD storm-trooper that it is, bought the cop's story hook, line and sinker. Still, wambugh can spin a good tale."
3,As a,"As a recent graduate of Upper Merion, these murders still haunt the school. Even though most of the teachers and all of the curren students were not alive when this happened it still hunts the school and community. This book is a must read for any Upper Merion student and remember to take it with a grain of salt b/c it was written as a novel and the facts were most likly distorted. Ps: two of the teachers involved in the book still work at the school and no Jay Smith is not the Principal any more and please stop asking if he still is."
1,Encyclopedia Brittanica,The merchant advertised the entire set but only sent volume R. It appeared to have been stolen from a public library in Texas.
5,GREAT READ,"The best read in a long time, as a practicing therapist I have to be selective how I spend my little bit of extra time and I have not been able to put it down, I have kept it in my computer bag since I got it. It is enjoyable to hear from a third to four generation removed practitioner from the original Imago concept framework which has allowed for field tested applications that only adds a greater impact to the superb Imago model. It has added a broader base of experience to a already great toolJeff B MFT/LEP from Calif."
2,Not so hot,"BEWARE THE IMAGO HYPE! My wife and I read the book and went to a recent Imago workshop run by Rick Brown. While the book has some very nice insight and may help some troubled couples, much of it is untestable conjecture and post-fact explanation based on the author's opinion. To blame everything on one's parent's and chilhood has gotten a bit old for the post-Freudian generation. While the exercises given are useful communication tools, the workshops are a waste of time with only Imago counslers being given as references and no mechanism allowed for refunding the dissapointed."
5,START SAVING!,"This is a superb book well crafted, but I paid $400 for a copy two years ago, maybe I was daft to pay so much at the time. I think we need to bring a balance back to book prices, but there you are, supply and demand!!!"
3,Not to Shabby,As a fan of Harry Potter and Lego's I thought that this would be a real treat. It turn's out that it's not all that great. The chamber's are to small to really do anything with the figurines. If your a collector it will be a welcome addition to your collection.
5,Bumper book of patchwork blocks!,"This hardbacked volume contains a huge collection of patchwork blocks each of which is carefully drawn and appropriately coloured on the computer. The author's source and a pattern name is given in each case and the blocks are sorted into the usual patchwork categories of four patch, nine patch etc.There is a very wide range of different styles and the blocks are fully indexed at the back of the book.This book is absolutely superb and once it is in your collection you will probably not need any other collection of patchwork block drawings.Beginners will need another book to complement this one because no actual finished quilt patterns are provided nor are there any instructions on how to make a quilt; Lynne Edwards's ""Sampler Quilt"" series would be an excellent partner as her books cover many different techniques."
5,5500 Quilt Block Designs,"This is a great Book to have in any quilters collection. Loads of block designs, but I am new to quilting so it will take me some time to understand how exactly to make a block based on their instructions, a more advanced quilter would have no problems I'm sure. Still highly recommend this book."
5,A Great Reference,"This book, along with Jinny Beyer's The Quilter's Album of Patchwork Patterns: 4050 Pieced Blocks for Quilters, is my go-to book when designing a quilt. I've made a number of quilts using the blocks from the book and leaf through it frequently looking for inspiration. I've drafted many of the blocks into my EQ5 (then EQ6 and EQ7) program which allows me to put them into full quilts to see what they'll look like. Once selecting blocks to sew, I always draft the old-fashioned way with graph paper and pencil and have had no trouble sewing any of the blocks that I've chosen.As some reviewers have said, not all seams are shown on all patterns, so knowledge of drafting and patchwork basics is a must to use it to its full advantage."
5,Tarzan of the 40s and 50s,I think it is great to be able to see the wonderful Taran films of the 40s and 50s. They are fantastic in themselves and nothing can compare. I think the next step is to release the Lex Barker Tarzan films. Both he and Johnny Weismuller shared the screen as Tarzan back then and they both mean a lot to people.Thanks for asking my opinion.
5,Tarzan collection vol 2,very good quality dvd's.I can play them in a zone2 player.It's good to have the french subtitles because I live in Belgium.
5,APPARENTLY TRUSTWORTHY AMAZON SELLER,I received my movies quickly and they were as advertised: In new condition. I would order from this person again.
5,The King of the Jungle is Back!,"I loved volume one of the Tarzan films, so I had to order volume two. These six films were produced by a different company so are have slightly different tone to them, but still highly enjoyable. In these films Tarzan has more interaction with local, and sometimes more civilized tribes as well as the various villages scattered about. I really enjoyed seeing ""Boy"" grow up throughout the movies. The only drawback to volume two was it didn't contain a bonus disc like volume one did, with original trailers and information on the Tarzan movies. Despite that fact it was a great buy!"
3,The Tarzan Collection: Part Two,"I found this collection of Tarzan movies not as interesting as the previous collection. Tarzan doesn't have quite the zip to his movements as previously, nor does he swing from vine to vine as before. Boy is also much older, and it isn't until the last episode that we are told he is away for schooling. I also missed seeing the original Jane."
4,Classic TARZAN,"For many people, Johnny Weismuller IS Tarzan. There have been many attempts, but there has not been a successful Tarzan franchise since. These are great fun to watch and remember watching on Sunday afternoons or wherever you may have first seen them. My children like a lot of old tv shows and movies, but don't seem to care for these movies. The price for this collection seems to rise and fall between $19.99 and $33.00."
3,Tarzan movies,"If you still think one abandoned illiteriate white man, one monkey, and crash survivor woman, and later a boy orgins unkown, can live in the harsh jungle of Africa. And later a trip to the the concrete jungle of N.Y.C . Than have we got a movie for you. Escapest fare is the nicest thing I can say about it"
4,"The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller, Vol. 2 (Tarzan Triumphs / Tarzan's Desert Mystery / Tarzan and the Amazons /",UM-GAHH-WAHH!!! TIMBA WALLA SIMBA- PRETTY DARN GOOD OVERALL!!!
2,Tarzan Collection Vol. 2,"I purchased this boxed set as a Christmas gift for someone and when the recipient opened it the first dvd was missing. I can say this has never happened to me before, but it is kind of embarrassing when someone opens your gift to them and part of it is missing."
3,Wish I could review it!,I have not received the G4 CD that I ordered and paid for. I could find no user-friendly way to address this issue to Amazon. I sent my complaint to the 'Contact Us' email but have received no response. I truly would love to be able to review this item!!Mark
3,colors different,"It is definitely a bedspread rather than a comforter, with a cotton backing and very little or no quilting. It's attractive, but with much less color variation than in the picture -- many more golds and browns."
1,"55mm, not 54mm","The wrench described here as a model 7612 is actually a 55mm wrench, not a 54mm wrench as advertised. The package matches the ""7612"" model number, but is clearly labeled as ""55mm."" The item that came out of the sealed package measured between 55.6mm and 56.0mm (using precision calipers) across the flats."
3,"Good memoir, little depth","I read this book hoping to better understand the constant strife in Haiti. I didn't get the understanding I was looking for. The litany of changing leaders is given, but no real examination of why each one fails is provided. For example, Aristide wins the election and then does not follow up by doing anything to improve conditions. He eventually is driven from power, but no details about his lack of action are provided in this book. A good read, but not what I was hoping for."
2,Not my cup of tea,Readable but overly self-congratulatory. Not much meat on historical events and anti-American bent is irritating. Light and readable but not of lasting value.
1,Did not enjoy it,After reading many of her articles which used poor fact checking and overt reliance on elites - I felt this book was boring even though it was not as overtly bias in its politics as her newspaper writing.
4,Two easy listening LPs on one CD from Paul Weston,"On this CD we have two lovely quite slow-tempo romantic monaural LPs by the Paul Weston orchestra. As always, the arrangements provide ideal music for romancing or dancing. The fact that they are both in mono, recorded in 1953, is not a problem for me because I enjoy the sound of the orchestra and it reminds me nostalgically of the time I used to whirl around a dance floor."
4,Works well,"I replaced my existing motherboard with this unit, and with a minimal amount of hassle, I had a new computer in an evening's time for under $50! In the year since, I've had no problems with it."
3,"Thorough, but dated","I used this text as a source for my Master's Thesis. Although I found it gave plenty of information regarding older sitcoms, it was limited by those of I Love Lucy, Roseanne, etc. It doesn't give very much basic information on feminist media theory, instead it takes a Stuart Hall cultural critique-esque approach to analyze the images of women in certain television shows. However, the number of texts that you can get from the authors' listings of sources is very rich. I intially purchased this book because of previous article readings I had done by Julie D'Acci. The text at whole is very long, but broken down into articles could be very helpful for media theory classrooms."
2,Not what I thought,I assumed <sigh> that since they are called 55 gallon industrial...they would fit a 55 gallon drum.They will not. The diameter is much to narrow.
2,"A Video for Parents, not for the baby","Maybe we waited too long to buy these kind of videos for our baby. But they are too boring. At 18 months, she won't even watch them. Now, Barney videos and Sesame Street, they are really good for her and she loves them too. But this music with graphic symbols and changing scenery, I think these videos play on some kind of parental instinct to want ""the best for their baby"", but, really, I wouldn't give you the time of day for this one, or any of the Baby Einsten, Baby Mozart, the entire line of videos, and I've bought them all. I gave it 2 stars since the music is nice. OK for background music!! I consider myself a victim of the baby video marketing efforts by all.That's why I have titled my Review, ""A Video for Parents, not for the Baby""."
3,"Rather short and kind of creepy, but then I'm not a baby","Conforms to the popular research that says babies like black, white, red and contrasts. I'm not a baby so I can't say for sure. My 4 year old who is fascinated by patterns loves this video. My two year old is bored silly with it.I do think that it is easy to decide before buying if your child will like it or not. It has soothing, infant appropriate sound track and very monotonous pictures. It's a good length for a baby who should not be watching TV in the first place but if you must I think this is about as close to a mobile on TV as you can get."
2,BORING..not very entertaining,"I tried this video with my daughter at 3 months, then at 6 months. Both times she was very distracted and wouldn't pay attention to the colors or objects. She did like the Einstein videos, but this one just didn't move along fast enough. She did like the music in between the scenes, but overall, just didn't like this one at all."
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased this video for my 9 month old. It failed to hold his attention. I have found that videos that feature real video of babies, animals, etc.. are more interesting to young ones than computer graphics."
3,quality,The image is not clear and sharp needs better quality. If produced from a original it should of been adjusted
5,outstanding,Very useful information for anyone in the restoration business. Terms I had heard of for years were explained. Examples were given so you could go see first hand. Of course it helps if you live in the South.
2,Fraudulent Reviews?,"I AM Chris Guin, and I can assure you that I did not provide the ""editorial review"" listed on this site. I am a former employee of Ms. McKinney, and while I enjoyed my time at PREP and feel that, in general, their resume and career books are of reasonably fair quality, not only do I resent their use of my name on a review that I never wrote, but I have to wonder -- in light of this fraudulent behavior -- how many of the other ""reviews"" of PREP's titles are equally fraudulent. Doesn't Amazon put ANY effort into verifying the content that is posted on this site?"
3,How do you take back something when it's better to let go?,"Bought the book, never read it. Why? Because some marriages are worth letting go. My wife wanted a divorce ~ 2.5 years ago, bought the book in my time of dispair and heartache and being lost. Divorce papers finalised ~ 18 months ago.I look back now and realise only time and support and self-reflection healed the wounds. Parting ways was just meant to be. In hindight that divorce was the best thing and no book was ever going to reverse that.Btw, for all those relationships and marriages that this book helped, well I'm genuinely happy about that."
4,Audiobook,"I liked most of it. Some of the religious stuff was a bit over the top for me but other then that it has very good views on kindness, respect, & communication."
4,A very good read,"I think that this book is very helpful in presenting the issues that pull marrriages apart. It is comforting to know that daily stresses and ""drift"" are a common component of every marriage, and that couples must do their best to ""de-consumerize"" their perception of marriage and focus on commitment. I thought the book also offered a candid appraisal that many marriage therapists are really not ""committed"" to making a marriage work, but fall into the ""consumer"" attitude in trying to make things work if that what the two spouses want. After an excellent job in laying out the issues that marriages face, I thought the book was a bit lean on offering solutions to the problems. Nonetheless, identifying the causes of issues is at least half the battle."
1,Over the sink cutting board is a wash out.,"I purchased this cutting board for use over my sink to save space and convenience. The design is flimsy with the handles coming out of the sides to easily and more importantly, it warped after the first use. Evidently the board is to thin to withhold any amount of water in which it should have been designed to withstand."
2,"Sink supports too short, Beautiful cutting board","The sink supports on this cutting board are too short and although they reach across my sink the short way, will not support the downward force of cutting. Further, the supports easily pull all the way out of the board and I was left holding the sink supports and the cutting board was on the floor. It's all very irritating and the defaults were obvious before I ever used it. I'm sending it back immediately.The cutting board itself is beautiful, although it comes unfinished and needs to be oiled before use."
3,Cutting board with handles,I bought the cutting board with handles. I didn't know the size. It is too short for my sink. I wish it was bigger.It should of stated the size of the board.
2,Faulty Design,Very excited to get the chopping board until I used it only 2 or 3 times and it broke into 3 pieces where it was glued. Seller did refund purchase cost
5,Definitely recommended,"Mr. Huch has provided a wonderful service to God's people. The work of Jesus was and is always to set people free. Just as the effects of ancestral sins are often passed down to us, Huch shows us that this curse can be lifted when we learn about and appropriate the life-giving power of Jesus' blood.I have however a few negative remarks: Missing was a chapter devoted to exactly how these curses can be canceled. And an introduction by Benny Hinn? Give me a break. Hinn is a discredited false prophet, filled with himself. Many might not even consider reading a book with an introduction by him. Finally, Huch's assertion that Jesus was not poor is a big stretch. Sounds like prosperity gospel nonsense.Still, all in all, I feel this book belongs in a prominent place on any serious Christian's bookcase. We are not destined to live like God's frozen people, and Huch shows us a foolproof way to be set free."
1,The Huckster exposed,"For years I have watched this piece of tripe and heap of embellished baloney sit on the shelves of the Amazon internet bookstore. I know Mr. Huch personally and he is no great giver of curse breaking knowledge. In fact, the people he 'touched' in his church and claimed a complete healing of all 'generational curses' have NOT been healed. Including Huch himself. He claims to have been healed and delivered from anger. In fact, he has a whole tape series touting it. As someone whom was one of the 'inner circle' I can say for sure that he is NOT delivered. Nor can he claim to have delivered anyone else. Besides, that is God's job, not Huch's job. Save your money, buy a Bible!!!"
2,Deception is the name of the game,"a mostly crackpot attempt to use fundamental Christianity as a source of empowerment after it has messed you up. Any book that has a foreword by Benny Hinn should send you running the other direction.I suppose if you buy into the propaganda of the T.B.N., then you may find this work beneficial. In fairness, it does contain some nice self-empowerment messages if you are operating within a tightly constricted mindset to begin with. The real hope would be that one could free himself from the curse of having to spend hard earned money on deceivers like Huch.For one who truly walks the talk of meaningful religion, go see author Charles W. Meister."
3,Free t Last,It was just okay. There was no new revelation for me and I question some of the things that he speaks.
5,FREE AT LAST,LARRY HUCH IS AN TERRIFIC AUTHOR. HE HAS LIVED WHAT HE HAS WROTE. EVERYTHING IN HIS BOOK CAN BE APPLIED TO THE READERS LIFE. A MUST READ BOOK. THANKS AMAZON.
3,An improvement over the original ep,This is the re-issue of the original ep Overkill released in 1987.This one though includes the out of print Overkill ep and new live tracks.This addition makes the collection a little more improved for die-hards.Purists or casual Metal fans will not like this.The sound of the disc is muddled and scratchy throughout.Only the studio title track sounds fresh and clear.The 1990 live tracks are better sounding than the ones from 1987.Their cover of Black Sabbath's Hole in the sky is excellent.Overall Overkill fans should get their Wrecking Your Neck-Live set to hear awesome live music.
1,TIME WARP ?,"How can a band release an album in the late ninties.... That sounds like the drivel that was being vomited out in the late seventies. Where's the progression, the self respect. I Just don't like it at all. NO STARS FOR STYLE, ONE STAR FOR EFFORT (DO THEY WEAR MAKEUP AND LYCRA?)."
2,Buy upgraded Eagle 2x instead,I bought this unit and tried to use it on 90+ furnaces and it would not read gross efficiency. That means that it wouldn't calculate the water vapor part of the equation. A call to the tech. department confirmed this! Buy the 2x c155 instead.
3,not many occasions to wear them on,"These are a little bit uncomfortable, albeit interesting to add to a costume. I put them on one of my stuffed animals now that I am done wearing them as a costume piece. They adjust to sizes big and small."
4,beautiful...,"Quite splendid. Russian music - always thrillingly primeval, emotive presented in full here in one of its best examples. Conducting is very excellent and singers are always top cut, especially the basses. Varlaam is especially well sung by Kuzetsnov. And of course the two Boris's are brilliant, although I think the second one is a slight edge on the first.Only problem is the Cyrillic texts are hard to read because I'm very new with these and should have much appreciated a romanised Russian version Livret as well. But that is my problem only and everyone else should have a most enjoying time of grandeur and splendour."
3,NOT BAD,"Even if both versions are not complete, it is still worth to purchase it for Mussorgskiy's music. Gergiev clearly knows what to do but his tempos are somewhat strange. In the first version only Nikolay Putilin and Konstantin Pluzhnikov. All other singers seem to sing their music without much pleasure or knowledge. In the second version Alexashkin has a Varlaam voice and his Boris is lamentable. Galusin is fine, Borodina is not seductive enogh for Marina, but the Rangoni of Nikitin is fine. Among the smaller roles Vasiliy Gerello is a very good Schelkalov. The chorus is far from the classic Bolshoi sound."
3,Boris...Boris?,"3 versions, what for! Bad versions, bad singers. You have Fedoseyev (original), Ermler and Melik Pashayev...It sounds much better. Great singers and orchestrationMartin"
5,One of the best from russia,"This is russian music and singing at top level. Here you have Moussorgskys OWN versions and not the softer, in my opinion a bit duller Rimsky-Korsakov version.I go for the so called (most) original, the last one here and if you just want one you can buy it as a one single opera cheaper but this set with two different versions is still a bargain and well worth its money.I think this is THE most russian opera you could get and Moussorgsky was a genius. And how about Gergiev et al? They are not so bad either (they are VERY good about this) so do youself or a friend a favour and buy this."
5,LOVE IT,This bra is so pretty. The little lace acents on the back and between the breasts mean that I am not embarrassed if the bra peeps out under my clothing. the bra is soft and very comfortable to wear. With some of victoria's secret models i have been stabbed by underwires. but no problem of that here. I am a 34A/B and loved the fit of the 34A. The price of the bra was so reasonable that I am considering buying another in a diff color.
2,entertaining,"it is just entertaining, the kind of book you might read while you are at the dentist office, just waiting. it is not a great book, but it may keep you thrilled if you give it a chance. i guess the author will not get any prizes for this kind of book, but he reaches certain kind of people who reads this kind of stuff. not recommended for people who are lookinf for something great and beleive me, life is too short to read bad books.LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
4,"Slow in the beginning, but gets better.","When I started reading this novel, I thought it was quite a boring read. The story moved too slowly, the chapters were too long and Norman Mailers language was too complex. It was like reading a detective novel too ambitious for it's own good, because since the plot isn't all that complicated it could have been made much more fast paced and exciting. However, the story constantly keeps on getting better, and in the end it is Mailers skill with language and form that makes you think you have read something special, allmost important."
4,The Last Dance,"Tim Madden awakens from a night of drunken excess, still groggy and unable to recall anything of last night.As the hangover clears he finds his car's passenger seat sticky with blood, a new tattoo with an old flame's name and the discovery of not one but two severed heads in the nearby woods, next to his secret marijuana stash.Was he responsible for the murder of two women, or was the crooked police chief setting him up? Madden, a failed writer, has the story of a life time to write if he can sleuth his way through it and live. A couple of ex-cons and a pissed off homosexual, his own former cell-mate, all want him dead.In Tough Guys Don't Dance, Mailer gives us many colorful characters, in his usual descriptive style, but don't be fooled. Through all the hard-nosed Irish and Portuguese on the streets of Cape Cod this book is worth the read for the flowing narrative language alone, and besides Madden is a tough guy, so why not give him the last dance.Tough Guys Don't Dance: A Novel"
4,Entertaining,"I wouldn't guess that Mailer was one of America's Greatest Writers Ever by this book. It seemed too contrived. The ending was a bit too Matlock for me (we learn the conspiracy through much monologue). But, then again, Mailer gets away with this, since it's done fairly well. Definitely a good book, hence the Star Rating I give. If you do enjoy this book, read Denis Johnson's ALREADY DEAD, for it's extremely similar ; I do believe Johnson did it on purpose."
3,Just enough to keep you interested,"The beginning of the novel was just enough to keep me interested. The only thing that prevented me from putting the book down was the analogy about the cigarettes and Tim Madden's wife which showed the concept of addiction. The novel gets more detailed and more twisted as you delve futher into it. Wife swaping all over the place. It's like a key party from the seventies, without the keys. The language was kept simple. The characters are people you could talk to, provide you want to use a machete to chop of someone's head and stash it in some mary jane. All in all, it was a book just to finish. The mean comedy of it was the only thing that made me hang on until the end."
3,Way Too Many Coincidences,"Great premise - but just not believable! How can so many people have so many conspiracies going on?? Also too many characters that fit into plot just a little too neatly (like Bolo). And too many unexplained coicidences - like why did Patty call Madeline Laurel, which strangely enough, is Jessica's real name? Too hard to follow and too hard to wrap your brain around all the goings on. Could have been much better after a couple of rewrites!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"I found myself glazing over the words just hoping to get to the end. I couldn't force myself to care about the story because I didn't care about the characters. The protagonist in this book isn't likable, so I found myself not caring about the outcome. Very disappointing."
1,why did Norman write this book?,"As a friend of Norman, I have to be honest. This is his worst book! I only gave it a two because of the sex scenes. It is not a good idea to read this book if you've never read him before or are a fan. All of his other books are excellent! Just aviod this one!!!!"
3,An o.k. book,"Given that the title and other review is in English and in Spanish, I thought this was a bilingual book. It is only in Spanish. I think the story is o.k., but my son is not quite 3, and he thinks the book is boring. It has some difficult words, so I think the correct age level should be elementary school. I think it's a little expensive for what it is. Ediciones Ekare has other books that we enjoy more."
5,Get bewitched by Witchery.,"Don't let the cheesy name fool you. This is some of the best metal music I've ever heard. Eclectic and powerful it is a mixture of thrash and death metal styles (and some would include a black metal comparison as well). I'd say that it is mostly thrash metal, though. With death metal vocals. The style reminds me of a cross between Megadeth, Death, Mastodon, and Slayer, but with the higher talent of greater musicians.I noticed this album and ""Symphony for the Devil"" as a result of a tip from a fellow fan on one of the fan boards out there. I was intrigued by the name, but I didn't expect them to be very good because they were fairly unknown and don't have much of a discography. But, what they have put out is fairly awesome, some of the greatest metal music ever. ""Disturbing the Beast"" quickly became my favorite metal tune.If you get a chance then buy this album immediately. You won't be disappointed."
1,Not Clrar,Not happy on how the clear part of the lens is not clear. I bought 2 pairs it's the same on both.Shipping was quick. Price was fair.
4,Revlon skinlights face poweder,I love this product i always put it on over a cream or liquid base and it covers up the makeup look and adds some sparkle to my face. I found this product at K-mart a couple years ago and now cannot find it anywhere i was so excited when i found it online and with a trustworthy sight and got the product. Each one lasts me about 2 yrs and ive spilt them a few times and everything so there is a good amount of product in them and they are worth the $15.00. I use them almoust everyday sept on my very few lazy days when i dont use makeup at all.
5,Revlon Skinlights,"LOVE Revlon Skinlights! I'm so thankful I can purchase on Amazon, the only place I have found it in years!"
2,Return of product,I returned the product because it was the wrong color. The return was completed expediently & without any problem.I would order the product again if it were in the right color. The seller deserves an A+.PS The rating really does apply as the product is fine; it was just the wrong shade.
2,Yet another window?,"It's a great idea and well made, but I agree that there are too few long pieces. My daughter has not shown a lot of interest once we had to plan more windows than walls to accommodate all the short pieces. They also 'tumble' over quickly. Rather disappointing. I remember a similar set from my childhood that offered a lot more possibilities."
1,Where are the long pieces?,"I guess I should have read some of the reviews before buying. There are over 100 short pieces in this kit.... makes the kit sound great 162 pieces should let you build lots of buildings, but with that many short ones, it is very hard to do more than 1 or 2 small ""freestyle"" buildings. and then in my hurried holiday shopping I did not realise that these are NOT Lincoln Logs, but an off brand.Another point of discontent with this set is that the cut outs are actually to deep which makes the round logs sit on the round log below it instead of the flat cut out. which makes them more in-stable than they should be. But overall my 2 1/2 yr old son loves them. I will just be purchasing another set so that they live up to my expectations."
4,Linkin Logs,My son loves this block set. So do I. Theres just so much you can do with them. I play with them about as much as my son does lol
