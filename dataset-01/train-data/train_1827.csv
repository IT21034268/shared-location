1,Short and to the point.,"The filter and brand itself is good, BUT it is NOT adjustable! I bought a 5 gallon tank from Petsmart and it came with this filter which is appropriate for a 10 gallon tank (hence the 10i). Needless to say the filter is WAY to powerful for anything OTHER than a 10 gallon tank. It LITERALLY sucked my Mystery Snail OUT of it's shell, if that's any indication for you. Nuff said? It's good, BUT way too strong for small fish, frogs, snails, etc. DO NOT BUY FOR SMALL AQUARIUM INHABITANTS!"
3,It's ok but,"When we first bought it we didn't have to change the water for a month. One thing though is you will have to put a partition around it so your fish won't keep on banging it. This filter is very quiet that you won't hear a sound. One day my fish kept banging it that it swam sideways. We needed to give it medicine. It took 7 days for my fish to feel better. This filter only fits for a 10 gallon. When we put it in a 2 gallon it was grabing the fish. If you put it in a 2 gallon put a partition around it. The water is very clear. I would say if you get this item, put a partition around it."
1,Does a poor job,"This filter came with my 5 gallon tank kit. At first, I thought it would be good because the filter packs are easy. After the first week, a gunky film developed at the bottom of the tank. I tried to siphon it out and change the filter more often, but it kept coming back. I finally bought the Aqua Clear filter and it is much better. The water is crystal clear and there is no built up on the bottom of the tank."
4,Excellent pads,"These brake pads are a little more money, but they create little dust, no noise, and great stopping power. These are my new preferred brake pads."
1,John Deere Stool,"I was pleased with the product when it arrived, but after about 3 days worth of use, the inside of the seat broke. We took it apart and saw that it nothing but a thin, cheap, piece of plastic. We took it out and replaced it with our own lexan. I am extremely disappointed with this product. I have photos and wish I could post them for all to see. And by the way, this was a gift for my father-in-law, who is extremely thin.I highly recommend not purchasing this product."
4,John Deere sits not spins,"I purchased this stool as a gift for my boyfriend.Overall the stool is fine, but I was very disappointed that it does not spin.The seat rests on the metal legs unlike any of the other garage stools I have seen - I would imagine over time the nice shiny stool cover will become worn just from sitting & normal maneuvering. I guess this is more of novelty item, versus a fully functional garage stool. Looks pretty."
3,Stool padding,The image quality of the stool is good however the amount of padding is horrible. One's backside cannot sit long do to the very thin padding.
1,MADE IN CHINA!,I do not to buy want Craftaman tools made in China! The forward reverse selector lever is made of plastic! How long do you think that's going to last? Thanks to Amazon's great return policy it's going back tomorrow for a refund. I'm now looking for an NOS Craftsman ratchet made in the USA.
5,Bloody Brilliant!,"A fantastic adaptation of my favorite manga, this is the bloody story of one of the most honorable men in literature."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"All the info in this book can be had on the internet for FREE. Especially don't buy this book if you're interested in Tufts, because they don't list much of their enrollment stats with this oprganization."
1,Terriblemente desilusionante,"El tema que la autora trata de desarrollar es muy interesante: la historia de Puerto Rico y Ana Pavlova entrelazados. Lamentablemente en ningun momento logra profundizar ninguna de las dos.Este es el primer libro de Rosario Ferre que leo , no creo poder volver a leer otro. Lo encontre basico, sin desarrollo de personajes o trama.El Vuelo del Cisne me parecio mal escrito, me refiero a errores gramaticales y ortograficos y pobre uso de la lengua espanola, luego me di cuenta de que estaba traducido del ingles por la misma autora...Me apena haberlo encontrado un cliche total!Mi Grupo de lectura no lo recomienda."
4,"Durable, easy to use camera case with spare battery","The JVC accessory kit is a nice compliment to the JVC Everio Camcorder I own. The case is simple, durable and has several pockets and compartments for accessories. The case is made for this camcorder and allows easy access to extra batteries or attachments. Considering that this kit includes a case and a 90 minute battery at a reasonable price, I would recommend the purchase of this product to others."
2,Sounds like a side-project,"Other than the hard-hitting covers of The Who and Johnny Thunders, this album continues the long-standing rock tradition of lame side projects. Dale Crover's originals sound like sub-par Melvins outtakes, lacking the sludgy heaviness of King Buzzo & company. Avoid this disc and put your cash toward one of the Melvins' countless releases."
5,"Melvins' drummer, Dale Crover causes ruckus with Altamont","As insane as the Hell's Angels, this album creates a superb blend of rock that will and should always be....Reminiscent of the 70's, this collaborative effort deserves high regards on the likes of people who still understand what the word ""ROCK"" still means!!!! Order this album, and if you order this album, purchase Melvins' Stonerwitch, Stag, and the Trilogy Series on Ipecac Records. Then if you get interested in Ipecac, check out FANTOMAS! These titles are essential tools for music afficionados everywhere!!!"
2,steerg wheel cover,"was impossible to get this item on my steering wheel. i waited and even heated it a little, but no good! it is now sitting in my garage unused"
3,introductory guide to complex analysis,"succinct introductory lecture notes and summary of the basics needed for undergraduate complex analysis or someone who is beginning to learn complex analysis, need complimentary text such as Alfhors or Rudin (real and complex analysis) for more comprehensive study. Compared to other undergraduate texts like brown and churchill, it is not as detailed in examples and explanations but it is structured in a way that hits the key points without loosing the reader in the details. I would suggest it as a study guide."
2,Review,"After reading three of Gaines books I have came to the conclusion that I am not a big fan of his writing. I am sure that he knows his information, however the way he writes is dull."
5,Laughs,When I read this book to my daughter she laughed at the twist in the story. Suitable for 3-5 year old kids.
5,A wonderful retelling!,The storyteller's voice is delightful and compelling and makes this tale perfect for oral telling or read-alouds. The illustrations are a perfect complement to the text and the full effect is even better than the sum of its stellar parts.
4,Annie plans a mystery night,"Annie Laurance, proprietor of the book store Murder on Demand, is delighted to be asked to put on a mystery night as part of a celebration of the history of Chastain, South Carolina. She is not so pleased at the prospect when she meets Corinne Webster who is in charge of the event. Corinne is a rude and arrogant person who has made enemies of half of the town. It is not surprising, when Corinne is found dead, that there is no shortage of suspects. Unfortunately, the police chief focuses in on Annie as his main suspect and seems unwilling to look any further. As a result, Annie and her fiance, Max Darling, have extra motivation to solve this murder. Annie puts herself in danger by exposing the murderer and the ending is bittersweet."
1,Not Acceptable,"This review is for the DVD rather than the movie. This DVD has one of the most egregious insertions of a commercial for another film that I have ever encountered. When you insert the disk into the player, a preview begins. One cannot skip past it, fast forward through it, or call up the menu. One must sit through this commercial each and every time the disk is played. I am resigned to the fact that I must skip past commercials on most disks, but to be forced to watch a commercial on a disk that I paid for simply isn't acceptable."
5,"seen em, love em.","i saw the crimea in hollywood a couple of months ago. they were opening up for billy corgan. needless to say. i was very impressed by their music. new sounds. individuals. they have a bright future. i bought this cd for 5 dollars from davey himself, he signed it and everything. listen to it pretty much everyday.if you're looking for a new sound and heart felt lyrics. this is for you. dont hesitate, buy it now."
1,Not much content for the verbage,"This seems like he spent all his time reviewing his sources, but not actually discussing the actual info and content of those sources.Worthless. I'd send it back if it were worth the shipping costs."
3,"You get what you pay for, though it's not too bad","Most cuticle nippers in pharmacies are too large and bulky, and/or not terribly sharp, not to mention expensive. These Club1 nippers are an alternative for hangnails and ingrown nail corners, though don't expect them to do fine cuticle trimming.Both nippers I bought clearly weren't originally 1/4 jaw. The top of the jaws were not perfectly smooth after evidently being machined down, probably from 1/2 jaw models. It's still sharp, but the fit is not perfect, and the shape is clumsy. For delicate work, spend the $30+ for a genuine made-in-Solingen nipper. A 1/2 jaw Dovo would do finer cuts than these 1/4 jaws, however, you can save the Dovo for small stuff, and use an expendable Club1 on harder cuttings.Also, you can't remove the spring-action, which I've always disliked particularly since these have a rough and jerky motion, but at least you can turn the little arms around."
3,Creepy drug-folk,"This record's cover, featuring a picture of a girl who seems to have been lured into a forest by little toadstool-shaped men, perfectly describes the music within. Songs such as 'Autumn' and 'Our Sea' are fungally seductive, and I imagine that these musicians prepared themselves for recording with rituals involving the consumption of mushroom broth. It's not all druggy haze, however, as there is a certain emotionally direct resonance to the material, brought through the sumptuous arrangements in a tide of sadness."
2,3/4 FULL,HELLO THIS CRUSHED RED CRUSHED PEPPER CONTAINER WAS NOT FULL THOUGHT THAT IT SHOULD.I HAD BOUGHT FROM DIFFERENT COMPANY NAME AND IT WAS FULL TO THE TOP SO I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN OR TELL SOMEONE ELSE TO SORRY !!!
3,A Very Cool CD!,"This CD is quite good. Its very fun to listen to and the songs are done quite well. The only problem with this CD is that once you start listening to it your never ever going to stop. This CD is one that can make your heart pump a little faster, it's exciting yet relaxing. An amazing CD to add to anyone's collection."
3,felt cheated,"not that its a bad book - its not but i was excited about this book,i had heard these were the go to guys of geese all about geese just geese and seemed to me wasnt anything i hadnt read in other books about ducks and geese. esp considering the hefty price tag."
3,It's okay...,"It's not a terrible book. The problem with it is that as the book goes on, the scenarios become more and more extreme, eventually winding up describing stuff that's either completely bizarre, or simply so over the top that it stops becoming erotica and becomes some kind of S&M Evel Kneivel act. (For example, during one particular scene, all that I could think of was ""That poor, poor rattlesnake. What did it ever do to deserve such treatment?"")It's okay, but not one of my favorites."
3,Haven't really helped...,"Wearing it, it will just keep you reminded that you have to correct your posture. Other than that, it did nothing..."
3,"Cute Frame, Can Be Difficult to Find Pictures to Fit!",I love the look of this frame but it's hard to find pictures that are so small so go through your pictures first or you may end up with a frame and no pictures to display in it! :(
5,Best Frame Ever,"I got this frame because my step-daughter requested it for our second grandbaby. I had purchased one for our first grandbaby and she fell in love with it, so when she became pregnant with the second one she ask that I please find this frame for him also. I did and she is extremely happy about it."
3,It's Wood Stain... what else were you expecting?,"Applying it to my unfinished pine bookcase definitely gave the bookcase a ""finished"" look, which shouldn't be surprising. My apartment smelled like turpentine for several days afterwards. I saved a little bit of money compared to buying this at my local hardware store, but most of my savings were eaten up in shipping costs, so at the end of the day it was only 2 or 3 dollars cheaper.It is possible I overbought- this container covered all of the full-size bookcase (even the back and top, which I didn't plan on staining) and there was still 1/3rd of the can left over. So small home-improvement/ arts and crafters may want to get the next size down."
1,New Formulation Nothing Like Original,Not suitable for my need. The color is totally different from Fruitwood of years past. It doesn't match the areas that were stained years ago.
1,Made cheap and overpriced - Broke very easily,"Nick Jr Spongebob Skater Full Size Wheeled BackpackVery unhappy with product, my son loves Spongebob and skateboarding...when I found this I knew he would love it and he did but the pull handle for rolling it broke and came all the way out and could not be fixed. It was about a month after purchased and I couldn't return it. Between the cost and shipping from the vendor I paid $40+ for this thing."
4,Good mix of art and info,"Plantagenet Somerset Fry, who also gave us ""Kings & Queens of England and Scotland,"" is a deft hand a giving fascinating tidbits of information and lots of great graphics to keep the pages turning. While there is much more gray in ""Castles,"" it is a comfortable mix of scholarly information and pedestrian description that allows a pseudo-historian like myself to experience the world of castles throughout the centuries."
3,Suprisingly good,"I have been kinda of hesitant about Najee's music it was kind of becoming mundane to the point of sappy! And as I started to listen to this CD I played it in my car, a mistake at first cause the first couple of cuts almost put me to sleep! Then it started to get nice and funky! Oh yeah you can ride to this and then I got hit with a so-so rendition of Moody's Blues, after grooving then taking me back to yawns ville it picked me back up to take me home. If it did not start off so slow and drag with the MB song I probably would have went for 4 stars."
4,I've use this sleeve with 2 separate iPAQs 3850 and 5555,"I have a great deal of success with this sleeve. I have used it with the 3850 and the 5555. I had an initial problem with the battery not charging properly but that seemed solved with a replacement battery sent by nexian.I did a review for the sleeve on PocketPCThoughts.com (search for my name). It's one of the main reasons I upgraded to the 5555, so that I could continue to use this sleeve with the iPAQ.the only weird issue I've had is using both CF slots at the same time. I'm currenlty using it with slot one containing a 1Gig CF microdrive and tried using it with a D-link wireless card in slot two and the display on the 3850 went weird. haven't had that issue with the 5555 bc the 5555 has built-in wireless/bluetooth."
5,Black printer cartridge,"Have used this product in the past but never at this low, low price.Have been using it for over a month and it works to perfection. Planto purchase again from this seller."
5,great reference book for biostats,This book was required for a graduate course in biological statistics and it's been a great help. It will be a great book to refer to for many years to come in scientific research.
2,Not for beginners,"I own this book, which I purchased for a graduate-level statistics class. This book does include virtually everything you'd need as a biological statistician, but I have found most of it totally unaccessible. It's far too verbose which makes it difficult to plow through and I feel it's mostly obsolete since it makes no reference to computer software. Since statistics is now a field based almost exclusively on computer programs, a book based entirely on doing statistics by hand is not helpful! I'd say, save your $100 and look elsewhere (like the literature and an SPSS manual)."
4,Stats Bible!,"This book is thought of as the ""Statistics Bible"" by the grad students at my school. This book is all a biologist will ever need for statistics reference."
5,Tree: A Life Story,This is an excellent book that actually explains how a tree works - an explanation that is not easy to find. It is beatifully written and not too technical. I bought two extra copies for gifts. Informative and entertaining.
5,where was suzuki when i was failing high school science?,"i was a terrible science student in high school. i could never wrap my head around how microorganisms affected my world outside the classroom. but then, i didn't have teachers like david suzuki and wayne grady. this fascinating book looks at a single tree, and examines it life up to its death. they have an engaging writing style that is informative and clear. two big thumbs up."
3,Tree: A critique,"This book is a biography of a Douglas Fir on the west coast of British ColumbiaIt has a great deal of information about the coastal forest and in particular about the Douglas Fir and the life that surrounds it. Although I know something of trees there was much that was new to me, and much that frankly surprised me.It is beautifully illustrated by Robert Bateman and altogether would make a wonderful gift for anyone despite its small size.The text does need severely editing, being obscure in places, and incorrect in others. For instance I was mildly annoyed to find that the conversions from hectares to acres were the wrong way round sometimes.Overall, though, the book is well worth the money, and doubtless will be improved in the writing of the next edition."
2,nice cup lousy lid,"I was trying to find a travel cup that I could microwave at work to heat up my coffee. I liked the idea of not heating in plastic and not having to transfer to another cup like with my stainless steel mug. Thought this was the answer....but alas the lid leaks. It does not have a rubber gasket of any kind and does not fit tight (not even close). This means I spill coffee both when I carry (even tipping it over only a little leaves coffee pooled up around the top, which in turns spills all over me when I try to take a drink)and does not hold at all if it should tip over. It does not matter how fast you are it will spill all over everything... almost like there is no lid on at all. My advice try to find one with a gasket or better sealing lid...good luck"
4,A great non-thermal ceramic travel mug,"Some reviewers had a problem with the mug leaking coffee; I've never had that happen. But I don't over-fill the cup. I even used it on bumpy roads and it still didn't leak from the top. It will NOT keep the coffee steamy hot for hours, but then neither does any mug of coffee. I bought this travel mug to drink a cup of coffee on my way to work, a 45-minute drive. By the time I'm in the parking lot at work, the coffee is gone and the last couple of sips were not hot. That may be a problem for those who want a thermal mug. This isn't one of those. It's simply a plain, not plastic or metal, ceramic travel mug. It is what it is. I like this one very much."
1,Won't use it,"Too thick, heavy, awkward. Don't like the plastic cover and wants to spill when drinking with or without it.I may yet return it."
3,Broken,"I ordered this mug as a present, I never got it, it was broken during shipment from warehouse to warehouse, so they sent an email and refunded my money, I did not order another one, but I liked the fact that I did not have to do anything about the broken mug. I had ordered one a couple of years ago and I really liked it, so I wanted to give this one as a present. Oh well"
3,cracked fast,"Just a caution, I know it's ceramic and I know it could crack...I just did not think it would happen so fast. Somewhere between getting the package open and using it two times...I notice a crack in the edge of the cup. I am sure it was not there (or at least not visible) when I opened it. I have had one of these in blue (not sure of manufacturer but it looks identical to this white one) for about 18 years...no problem. This one I have had for a couple weeks and cracked.I would expect it to shatter when dropped, or crack when clinked around in the dishwasher but this happened through some subtle unremarkable event. Just saying, maybe they're not all made equally?"
2,As In The Days of Noah,"I thought I ordered In The Days of Noah , not As In The Days of Noah. It was terrible."
1,awful,this disnt even come close to fitting my 2003 2500... half was sticking out looked awful.. this should be 20 dollars
3,Unspectacular...but decent.,"His first album after ""The Jazz Singer"" is nothing to brag about but it's still a listenable album highlighted by the radio-friendly ""Yesterday's Songs"". It's not essential but it's worth consideration if you're a die hard fan or just like soft rock.A nice album to pass the time away with."
3,Nice album,"This is ND in the heart of his career putting out great hit songs and fairly decent albums. This CD contains the hit single ""Be Mine Tonight"" which is not on any greatest hits package. Some other rather nice tunes make this album very good and enjoyable to listen to."
2,Buy it for 2 songs only,"You should buy this for his two big hits:Yesterday's Songs and Be Mine Tonight (which is hard to find).Otherwise, save your money for one of his greatest hits packages.Don't get me wrong, he's one of the best singer/songwritersever!"
2,IOne of his worst ever.,"Like most Diamond fanatics, I was juiced for a new album after the Jazz Singer. What a let down. This album is mostly FORCED and FLAT. The lyrics rarely reached greeting card sentimnts. I like only three songs on it. ""Yesterday's Songs,"" ""Be Mind Tonight,"" and the title song. ""Be Mine Tonight"" became a top 40 single, but the lyrics are so shallow, and he repeats ""Be Mine Tonight' over and over and over again.Strangely, in concert that year Neil did ""Rainy Day Song,"" and ""Guitar Heaven."" These were SOOOOOOOOO much better in concert than they were on the album. ""Guitar Heaven"" on the box set ""Stages"" is a sheer delight."
2,Cheap...,The first time I used this puller the 4581-2 broke. I hope the other three pieces hold up. For the price I had expected much better.
1,Useless,"There is no bobbin, nothing to hold a stitch. It will be going in the garbage as soon as my kids aren't looking."
1,So disappointed,"My 6 year old got this for Christmas 6 months ago. I still can't figure out how to make it work right. I am a professional seamstress and I can't work this crappy little plastic thing. How is a child supposed to? I wish we could return it, but the relative who purchased it didn't keep a receipt. I think I'm going to go buy her a real mini machine."
1,Don't Let the Singer Name Fool You. This Thing is JUNK!,"This 'sewing machine' has been nothing but disappointment for my daughter and frustration for me.First, the protective casing keeps you from being able to access the needle to thread it. It took about 10 minutes on the threading, even using the needle threader--which broke about 5 minutes into the effort so I had to get another one.Second, once we finally got it threaded, the stitches didn't hold.Third, when the needle breaks, there's no way to replace it.Don't buy this thing unless you want to make a child very sad. And a parent very frustrated."
1,doesnt work,I purchased two of them and never could get either one of them to sew. The needle came out of the first one and while trying to change it something broke. So I had hoped the second one would work better but it didn't. Needless to say she was one disappointed little girl. The concept is great but it is a cheap cheap disposable product.
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT! SHAME ON YOU SINGER!!!,"What a terrible product! Our daughter received this as a Christmas present ffrom her favorite uncle, and was so dissappointed when it wouldn't sew, and then the ""chain stitching"" came right out with only a little tug, so nothing she sewed stayed together! So for sewers out there, the problem is simple---NO BOBBIN! You're just punching holes in fabric. Shame on Singer for lending its name to such a poorly conceived product. It's actually kind of ironic that the manufacturer would risk putting a real needle on it, but then no bobbin to make it really sew. I've asked uncle for a gift receipt so we can return this $30 piece of junk......."
2,"mostly works, but then unravels. Pretend Only.","We received this as a gift, so I'm not out any money. However, what effort I put into helping my daughter set up and then sew is wasted when the chain stitch immediately unravels or pulls out of the fabric. It worked the first 3 times we sewed, and that seemed good enough, despite the unraveling. She understood to be careful with the fabric until i could anchor stitch the final thread to prevent unravelling.Now, it doesn't work anymore. The stitches don't seem to be linking properly.The safety is good- there's no chance of caught fingers. it's easy to use and makes a satisfying ""sewing"" sound for little ones, but for other than pretend, it's useless."
1,Zero Stars,Wish I could give this piece of trash zero stars!!! I also wish I would have read reviews before purchasing!!!!! The only good review on here is a total fake!!!!
1,Terrible Product,"We were so excited when my daughter opened her sewing machine at Christmas. We read the directions, and expected not much more than a simple straight stitch. What a disappointment. It won't stitch right, even for me. She is extremely patient and very mature for her age, and yet simply trying to thread the needle make ME want to chuck this toy out the window. Singer, I am so sad to say that you made a piece of junk, and I will NO LONGER BUY SINGER products!!"
1,junk toy,"as everyone else said, this machine does not work. i wish i'd read reviews before i bought it. i just saw it in the store and thought it would be so fun for my daughter to get so sew along side me. PLEASE dont waste your money on this toy."
1,A constant struggle!,"This machine is a constant struggle. We bought it for our six year old daughter. We knew she would need some help, but unfortunately it is impossible for her to use this - it is a struggle for adults to use the machine. The stitches are either so loose they pull right out, or so tight that the machine jams. Threading is a five minute ordeal.How disappointing. My daughter was so excited to try sewing - now she thinks of it as just some noisy machine that is too difficult for her to use - too difficult for Daddy and Mommy to use! This one will be returned - I will gladly pay just another $50-$60 for a real sewing machine that my daughter can actually use. When we buy another machine, the two of us can work on re-sewing the dress that has already fallen apart after being sewn together with this disappointing Singer product."
2,It was too hard for my granddaughter to thread the needle.,"I gave this as a gift to my Granddaughter on Christmas Eve. She was not able to tread the needle so I gave it a try. After 10 minutes I still could not thread it. My daughter in-law finally was able to. Once that was done, everything else worked fine."
1,Do not waste your money!,I bought this for my oldest daughter about 6 years ago and it was terrible. There was no bobbin and you couldn't actually sew anything...just pretend. What a rip off!
1,Worst Product EVER,"My son has been wanting to learn to sew, so I figured a nice toy machine would be a great start. I saw this at a store and I got a great deal so I figured it would fit our needs. I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in anything I've bought for the kids. I only gave it 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. The test piece of fabric stuck in the machine and took us some time to get it out. Once we finally did, my son tried to sew a little. That also got stuck and when we finally got it out, the stitch unraveled before our eyes. It says you need to do a finishing stitch with a needle and thread (translation: parents need to do it), but the stitch doesn't even stay in long enough to let you do that. I would not recommend this product at all. Spend a little more and get something that works."
1,A Real Dinger for Singer,"Well, here I am one more dissatisfied customer! You would think someone from Singer would read these and do something about it!! ""It Really Sews!"" I think we could get them on false advertising. What a crock and waste of time and money. Please do yourself and your child a favor, ""DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!"" The frustration and dissapointment is not worth it. Another Duped Customer."
2,Not great,"I got this for my daughter who will be 10 in Feb. She has wanted a sewing machine very badly. This one is made of cheap plastic, and no matter how many times we read the instructions and try to close the end, as soon as we remove it, it unravels. I think I'd spend more money and get something better. As my daughter says ""It's very irriating."""
2,not worth it!,"My daughter was very excited to receive this for Christmas, until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine. It literally would not work anymore. I tried everything. Maybe it's defective.....but from other reviews I read, I think it's just a really bad attempt at a great idea. Too bad....she is very disappointed...."
1,SAVE YOURSELF 15 BUCKS,"We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift. What a nightmare. First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better. This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it. It cuts NOTHING. This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something. It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle. The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch. There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together. We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking! The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING. My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic."
1,Wish I had read the reviews...,"Like other people I was hooked in by the price and the fact that it's SINGER, and my young daughter only wanted to do some basic sewing, nothing fancy.We got this for Christmas for our daughter and thought she'd be able to make something small - no such luck.Luckily we had purchased a few other things on her Christmas list. But we're taking this thing back and will gladly double or triple our budget for something that works."
1,"Lesson should be: ""Research""","No fun to have your child discouraged. The only lesson this provided me was to NEVER add something to my childs wish list that I have NOT researched. Geesh! Who would have thought a childs sewing machine would be so difficult. What is the point REALLY? Singer has the perfect opportunity to prepare for future customers, but NOT like this.This was a gift for my daughter and she was so patient, preparing and reading all the details only for it to come un threaded after the fourth stitch. Have rethreaded and followed ALL trouble-shooting.No fun. Durable, only in the fact that is doesn't do anything so, it will last forever doing NOTHING! Overall, the toy is a gimmick and only provides a educational value of what NOT to spend your money on. What a waste of time."
1,Sewing without a bobbin...?,"I feel awful for buying this for my child. He's about to turn six and is always wanting me to sew him clothes and blankets for his stuffed animals. I thought we coudl both use this (him for learning and me when I need a few stitches) and maybe make some crafts together. No dice. Not only was it impossible to thread, but it stitched ONCE before stopping and jamming. Then it wouldn't stitch after that - the plastic piece was off kilter somewhow.I'm on a mission to get a new one. Poor kid...and poor me! I was excited about teaching him a new skill."
1,Do not buy!,"As everyone else has said, this thing is horrible. My daughter was sooo excited about sewing, but it won't be happening on this thing. If I can't find a kid's machine that works, I'll just teach her on mine. I just get nervous about little fingers and fast moving needles.I had a kid's machine when I was little, but I don't remember the kind. It was red and yellow, I believe and had some 70's flowers. It was purchased in the late 80's at a thrift store, so no clue when it was made, does anyone know what this machine could be? It worked well."
1,Most Worthless Sewing Machine even for KIDS!,"Bought this machine for my daughter. Yep, it was cheap, but I thought at least she can start somewhere and it had a needle guard so she wouldn't accidentally get her fingers under the needle. This thing NEVER EVEN SEWED! It would stitch, but the stitches always came out. Not sure how it can sew if there is no bobbin. I went over and over the directions trying to figure out if there was something I was missing, but nope I wasn't ! So it went back and they almost didn't take it back b/c I threw the box out! Definitely save yourself time money and aggravation and DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT! I'm even upset I have to give it any stars at all on this review.Singer Chain Stitch Sewing Machine SetU"
2,"Works, but barely","I got this toy to work, you have to set the needle deep into the fabric to get it to hold the fabrics together. Maybe they improved it after all the complaints the past few years? The stitches it makes are pretty loose and come apart easily if you don't have the tension just right. Don't count on it to make anything too sturdy, it really is only good for a toy for a beginner who just wants the satisfaction of sewing a line or two pieces of fabric together. So far, that's all my daughter wants, so it's okay by me."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"This is the worst waste of $25 - you'd do better giving it to your child to use to purchase penny candy with. Or flush it, because then you'd at least save yourself the frustration. I didn't buy this toy through Amazon - I wouldn't have, because otherwise I would have read the reviews - but picked it up on spur of the moment at the store. The machine is impossible to thread and that factor alone is more frustrating than you would believe. Add to that the disappointment of a 5 year old being unable to sew and it was one of the worst purchases I've made."
1,Waste of Money,This sewing machine is garbage. Of course the stiches unravel--you only have the one thread. There is no bobbin or bottom thread. The real issue is the machine itself. This is more than impossible to re-thread the needle. Big disappointment for the Singer name. Don't buy this toy!
4,Very cute for a young girl,"Picked up this sewing machine for my 7 year old daughter who loves to make things and draw/design clothes. She was thrilled. Hadn't read the reviews until now, but I'm glad I didn't because it would have probably prevented me from buying it. True, threading the needle isn't the easiest thing in the world, but it certainly isn't impossible, like some of these reviews imply. Is threading ANY needle ever easy?This little sewing machine is a good tool for teaching a little kid patience and also how to sew on a sewing machine. The stitches DO hold, as long as you are careful when you finish a piece and you pull the stitch through to the backside and complete it as they show in the instructions."
1,child's singer sewing machine,"Singer Chain Stitch Sewing Machine SetThis sewing machine sewed maybe 5 stitches before stopping, I put in new batteries and it sewed two stitches then never again. I bought it for my daughter for xmas and it was as much a disappointment as it was a waste of hard earned money. She's now trying to learn on my wife's machine instead."
1,Great in Theory.... Leaves You Weary,"Thank goodness I purchased this product on clearance! It's a terrible first sewing machine for anxious little ones who just want to sew like a grown up!All of the past posts have said it all! I can't tell you how horrible the disappointment was for my little girl. The worst part was that she thought that the fault was hers when it was this horrendous pretense of a Singer sewing machine!After an hour of frustration, I told my little one that we would be shopping for something else to teach her sewing on. As for this one, I told her we could yank the thread and she could ""pretend"" to sew on it. The action, noise, and semblance of the real deal will appeal to her imaginary play!Please don't bother with this sewing machine!p.s. Shame on you, Singer.... for allowing this awful toy have your name on it! You are souring the sewing experience for the seamstresses of tomorrow!"
1,worst product ever,"I bought 2 of these specifically because they make the chain stitch. Even though it was a child's machine, I thought it might chain 2 pieces of fabric together somewhat decent. It would stitch about 6 inches, then bind up. It was a complete waste of money, and not even worth returning because of shipping and restocking fees. I hate to even give it 1 star, I would give it a negative if I could."
1,Just Terrible,"This product, as stated in the title, is terrible. I had never used a sewing machine before so I figured a child's one would work even for a beginner. Terrible idea. The stitching has always ended up too loose and comes apart altogether. I would not recommend this to anyone; it is a waste of money."
1,JUNK,I agree 100% with the other reviews. This is a piece of junk and Singer needs to know this. Total waste of TIME and money. We are VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1,"Zero stars, if possible",Completely useless. Stitches come out immediately. Very loud. Cord is not long enough to reach anything. Comes with the smallest piece of fabric possible.
2,Splatterpunks: Extreme Boredom,"I was actually really excited to order this book, but what a let-down. The stories left me lukewarm at best. I don't think any of the stories were downright terrible, but they just weren't very stimulating, as I now can't remember one detail that stands out in my mind. But I do remember getting bored and dumping it off on the used bookstore lady in my town."
2,Splatterjunk,"This a pretty lackluster collection of stories and they don't seem to be that extreme which was supposed to be the whole point of the book. The two stories by RC Matheson are clearly the best . I also enjoyed ""Night They Missed the Horrow Show"" and ""Goodbye, Dark Love"". Most of the stories were just ok and some like ""Less Than Zombie"" were just dull and pointless."
2,Don't waste your time,This book features many stories yet only maybe six or seven are worth reading.And of those only about three are anything special.Most of the stories have no plot or character development and are just pointless. I was so disappointed by the quality of the stories that I found myself begging for more graphic violence or sex.The stories are neither graphic nor scary. Complete waste of time.
2,Give me a break,"First off, the stories aren't all that disgusting or disturbing. There are a couple that are pretty good, but overall it wasn't a good book. The fact that before each story proclaims for almost every single writer that they are not or do not want to be called a ""splatterpunk"" kills the book. There was only one writer in the whole book that the author was able to say was a splatterpunk. Every other writer said they don't wanna be called one or the author says they aren't one. For a book entitled Splatterpunks, there sure aren't many in it."
5,"As the serpent said, ""taste this & you will know evil...""",Even though I'm a Christian I love horror & mystery novels..this one is rough at times but as visceral as you can get...
1,Operacion Fangio-Terrible Movie.,"This movie is terribly bad,Horrible Quality, dull and boring, Recounts the Cuban Side of the story(If you consider Fidel Castro's regime a Reliable source), I had this misfortune of buying this dvd at a festival under false pretenses, I was told there were scenes of the actual Grand Prix(Grand Premio De Cuba) very little in fact is in this movie, This movie was done on scene in Cuba(why else would it be so biased?) Argentina,Spain, The actors are horrible,It is misinformed, And Puts A Great Racer like Fangio in such a Bad movie that is not worth it."
5,Good CD with a lot of songs of tv series.,"Better than Under these Rocks and Stones, but worst than What if if means something.I can see that Chantal has influenced Avril lavigne"
4,sophmore album,"Personally, I feel that Chantal's best is her first cd. It just holds alot of my favorites and memories to go along w/ it. I just bought Colour Moving and Still, so I have yet to really identify it w/ a situation/memory. My Fav tracks on this Cd are ""Until we Die"", ""Soul Searching"", and ""M"". ""Until we Die"" holds that ""Sarrounded"" feel, that evokes every emsotion possible.""Under these Rocks and stones"" seemed to be more personal. ""Colour Moving and Still"" seems to be a more like I'm sharing my world/life, with someone.But it still hold its personal quality. The music is just as enchanting. Hopefully Colour will be a another memorable album. Ashlind"
2,23 years and counting..,"Well if you like white, processed, nasal, shrill, Canadian singers, like Allanis, than Chantel's for you. Her lyrics are only good. Her emotional range is thin. Her songs sound alike. At times fingernails and a chalkboard come to mind. This CD has even less soul than her last release. Don't get me wrong she *can* sing. In a few years maybe she will find something worth singing about. Until then she's a good Napster candidate but not worth any $$. American or otherwise."
5,A Canadian Music Prodigy,"CHANTAL KREVIAZUK knows how to connect with her audience. Take a listen to her sophmore release as she shows off her exceptional talents for songwriting. Full of melodic gems and surprises, her voice is full of emotion as it flows with the delicate ease of her piano playing. The first single, ""Before You"" is an instant hit! A very radio friendly ode to a special someone. Other impressive tracks include ""Blue"", ""Far Away"", the heartbreaking ""M"" and ""Little Things"". This homegrown Canadian artist is often over-looked in international countries but she carries with her much promise. Look forward to her third album!"
5,A wonderful songstress,"Chantal may not have the most powerful voice in the world, but she makes great do with what she has. And, besides her voice, she can really play that piano! If you are a fan of music with some piano riffs, rather than guitar and drums, pick up her cd! Sure, her name is hard pronounce, but at least you can't get it mixed up with someone elses. The best song is the first, Blue. But overall great album, not just a one hit wonder."
4,One album that deserves a listen!,"Being a dawsons creek fan i often hear songs on the show that i like, if they're really good i'll follow it up by checking out who the songs are by and listening to them. Whilst doing this Chantal Kreviazuk came up more than once, so i decided to try the album. Now the music on it might not be everyones cup of tea but it is excellent. Chantal has an amazing voice and her songs are orginal and great to listen to, i think you might need to give it a few listens before you really get to like it but it is definately a good album. She really deserves more recognition as a very gifted and talented artist."
3,Passable,"Despite her Pollyanna approach to life (far too many of her songs involve dying children), at times cloyingly poppish sound, and her vaguely unpleasant and Alanis-esque singing voice, Chantal manages to create a few gems, including the haunting ""Eve"" (used quite effectively on an otherwise hideous episode of Dawson's Creek) and the rousing ""Souls.""The album's production is its strongest point. Its sound is cohesive and consistent, creating different but interconnnected moods for each song, and resulting in several memorable moments, one highlight being the extended piano intro to Souls.A sweet but on the whole unmemorable collection from a passable singer-songwriter."
5,An Incredible And Moving New Voice,"Chantal (who sings the title song for the NBC show Providence, in case you didn't know) is a moving and inspirational new voice in classical music today. Her songs like ""Feels Like Home"" and ""Jet Plane"" are the kind of songs you never get tired of hearing. You can feel all the emotion in the songs; it's like she has perfectly captured the way you feel about your loved one in her words. She has a beautiful singing voice, and this cd is fantastic! Anyone would enjoy this cd."
1,Does not do Hi-Speed USB,This card does not do Hi-Speed USB. It is limited to 12Mbits/sec (like USB 1.0). This makes the card pretty much useless.
4,Perfect replacement cover and easy to install.,"The Camco plumbing vent replacement is perfect for replacing the original vent covers. It is inexpensive, comes with sealant to apply on installation and I would strong recommend this brand!"
2,This toy is overrated....,"I bought this toy with high expectations, but found it was overrated. It's very colorful and with all the typical Lamaze features. If you have one already, there's no need to get another one which is virtually the same. My baby looks at it some times, but not super interested. Maybe it's just her. Overall, I think this toy is just ok. I didn't find anything magic about it. We have another Lamaze toy, and this one isn't much different."
2,I don't get the whole hype with these Lamaze toys??,"I know these Lamaze toys have very very high reviews... we got 2 before my daughter was even born -- the peacock and the moose one... But honestly, I didn't think they were anything special! My daughter still doesn't show much interest in these things at 9 months... we use to hang them on the stroller thinking that she would play with them... she didn't so I took it off. It was just getting dirty hanging there. And these things weren't cheap either! Maybe it's just us but I really wasn't impressed with any of the Lamaze take along toys... maybe my daughter would like them when she gets older..."
2,nothing special,"my baby didnt realy pay too much attention to this toy despite all great reviews, maybe he i should of gotten it when he was younger i got it while he was 5-6 months"
3,Much larger than you would think,"We ordered this toy for our son and thought we will use it as a car seat toy. The toy is huge. At one point I thought it might scare infants. Overall toy design, colors, material, and sensory objects are very good and well worth. Only if they could make it a little smaller.Since then we are using this as a crib toy and he seems to enjoy the sensory objects on the toy."
4,Very colorful !,"I think this is a great toy , my 4 month old likes to chew on it, when he does it makes crinkling sounds, it is very colorful to look at so it holds his attention for a while, It is a little big for him now , but he'll grow into it in a couple of months."
5,"Baby loves this for a ""long"" time.","Our son loved looking at this toy when he was too young to reach out and grab it. Now that he is almost 7 months old, it is still a big favorite. He loves to chew on the wings and feel the textures. This toy is also a crowd favorite at playdates with even older children. This toy is well worth the money."
5,Great toy for little ones.,"We bought this for our little one when she was 2months, she loved the toy. It was the only way we could get her to go to sleep, she would always try to grab Jacque. :)"
5,My baby's best friend!,My baby was in love with this lil guy. Mr. Peacock was his best friend from week 2 until about 5 months of age. At first he would talk to him in his crib and later on he 'ate' every last bit of this lil guy - the mouth exploration stage. Must have for a new baby!
4,Worth it,He plays with this toy alot. The big eyes and crinkle sounds I think makes it more attractive for him to play with it.
5,My grand daughter loves Jacque!,I bought this for my grand daughter now 2 months old & she loves it already. My daughter-in-law says she smiles & coos when she sees it. I'm sure she will enjoy it even more as her motor skills develop. It's very bright and cute and has alot to focus on.
4,peacock,bigger than expected & had more textures and stuff than I thought It would... delightfully better than I hoped it would be
4,Cute,"My son is now 3 months old and loves to play with this toy. There are lots of little parts for him to hold, and plenty of textures for him to explore. I'm glad I bought it."
2,Didn't like :(,"We have a couple other similar Lamaze toys and really liked them, but this one was big and rigid compared to those, just wasn't a favorite for us."
3,Baby likes tug & play better,"The peacock is bright and fun, but as another reviewer said it is hard to grab. Our daughter has had the tug & play too and that engages her more. She has been enjoying both at ages 4-5 months and probably will for some time."
3,peacock,"My neice loves its and thats all that matters to me, but it's not as big as it looks in the picture"
3,My infant grandson did not play with this,"My grandson did not like this toy. Not knocking the product, nothing wrong with it. Just saying different kids like different toys. A lot to pay for an item that was not appreciated AT ALL!"
5,Babys favorite toy for over 7 months,"Its colorful, noisy and flat out cute. My daughter loves this simple toy. Bought it when she was a few days old and its still her favorite at almost 8 months. A small collection of these Lamaze toys is perfect for a baby shower gift."
5,Baby's Favorite Toy!,"I bought Jacques the Peacock for my 2 month old grandson. He loves this toy! The black and white backsides of Jacque's feathers make him kick his legs like crazy, and he squeals and coos for at least 10 minutes whenever we play with this cute little peacock. Now that he's discovered he can control his hands he bats at Jacques and grabs his feathers - it's fun to see the surprised look on his face when he hears the crinkly sound it makes when he grabs it. I highly recommend this toy!"
5,Jacques is a favorite with our baby,"Our daughter loves Jacques. He has several different black and white patterns on the back of his tail feathers, which are entertaining for younger babies. Lots of pretty colors, fun patterns and crackly sounds keep older babies happy. The tail feathers are a good size for chewing, too. Our baby loves this one."
5,Best Toy,I bought this toy because of the great reviews and it lived up to all the high marks. It was my baby gandson's favorite Christmas toy.
2,Boring for six-months and up,I gave this to my son when he was six months old and he grew bored with it within three minutes I also found it a bit scary-looking so he might have felt the same. Maybe younger babies might like it but we might as well buy something that a baby will be interested in for a longer period of time.
3,OK toy,"For some reason our 6-month old has simply not taken to this toy. It is soft and colorful and has lots of textures, but she simply doesn't pay attention to it. I'm not sure why she doesn't like it more."
2,Just Okay,"I got this for my shower and thought it was a great gift based on reviews ... but my little one never really noticed this toy when she was a new born and not mobile -- she is 6.5 months now.. all she wants to do now is to crawl around, grab stuff and put it in her mouth and this rarely gets her attention... overall i like it coz its cute ..thats the only +."
5,"Cute, Colorful Peacock","This Lamaze Jacques the Peacock, is so awesome. My 6 month old just loves playing with it, chewing it and loves listening to all the different sounds it makes. She is so amazed at the different color's.... I highy recommend this to everyone!"
5,A hit!,"My baby boy loves this peacock! He has played with him everyday for about a month. He is 4 months old and loves to see Jacque 'flying"" through the air. He is very colorful and easy for him to handle. I also like him because he is big enough that he does not fall out of his carrier."
5,Mom-Mom H,I recently purchased this Lamaze toy and my 3 month old grandson loves it! He smiles and coos whenever he sees it. It is easily moved from one carrier to another. It's colorful and makes great crinkly sounds. Definitely worth buying!
2,"Cute, but not practical for us.","We initially bought this toy because of the raving reviews, however, it was disappointing. Our daughter (3 months at the time) did not seem to be interested in Jacques, plus it was hard for her to hold/grasp. The tag that is attached to the toy says it is machine washable, but after washing it and lightly drying it, the mirror became foggy. We returned it and bought Mortimer the Moose instead. Our baby loves Morty!"
4,Baby toy,This was a great gift for our niece. She loves the noise that it makes and the sounds as well as the colors.
5,totally makes her smile,"I attached it to her swing and she smiles at him constantly. She'll wake up and instead of crying, she smiles because of this peacock. It works everytime!"
5,amazing toy for infants!,i bought this for my daughter when she was a little over a month old and she has loved it from day one! she's always grabbing the feathers and trying to eat the nose and feet. best money i've spent on a toy!!
5,Another Awesome Toy by Lamaze,"I have always loved Lamaze toys, and my toddlers had a few. I just purchased and received Jacques the Peacock for my 3 month old and she absolutely loves it. The colors are so bright and eye catching.. and she has not put it down since I showed it to her. Thank you Lamaze!"
5,Great Toy!,"We saw this in Babies-R-Us and our little baby couldn't stop laughing when she saw it. I think it's the combination of the BIG EYES, the squeaker in one of the wings, the mirror in another wing, the krinkly sounds and the bright colors.The hook on top is useful for hanging from the carseat or from the swing -- however, if you are just trying to make Jacque dance for your baby, the hook kind of gets in the way but that is a minor note.Overall, I highly recommend Jacque -- she has not tired of him yet and everytime she sees good ol' Jacque, her face lights up and she babbles at him."
2,not a hit with a 6 m/o,"We bought this for our 6-months-old son. It's not a hit. The problem is that the tail consists of very hard and large pieces that barely bend. The kid has a hard time grabbing the toy and cannot really manipulate with any elements. Nothing here can be stretched, squeezed, rolled, pulled -- unlike, say, those long legs or necks or tails in other similar toys. Our son can't even stick any part of this toy in his mouth! So, he understandably doesn't want to play with it. The peacock looks pretty, but you don't really want to touch it. Our kid loves the elefant, the giraffe, and the monkey made by Tiny Love."
5,Cute toy.,"I bought this for my son when he was about a month or so old, and he really liked it. I took it everywhere with us, and it kept him entertained. Jacques comes complete with a mirror, a squeaker, taggies, lots of textures and colors, and a link so he can tag along. The entire back of Jacques' plumage consists of a variety of black and white patterns, which my son loved to stare at.He is now 7 months, and doesn't play with it as much as he used to since he is more into musical and talking toys, the jumperoo, and is busy crawling and cruising...but Jacques continues to never be too far from my son's reach."
4,Nice toy,"Very colorful and playful toy. My baby girl who is 14 weeks old enjoys swatting at it when hung over her while on her playmat. She likes the crinkly noise and likes to eat its little beak. I wished it had more things for her to hold on because it has those wide flat panels (wings of the bird) and it's hard for a little one my age to grab onto it. It is nice that the back side of the toy is also interesting so even when it's turned there's something for my baby to look it. The squeaky green button is useless because it is not a soft button so babies aren't able to press down on it to make the noise. The plastic ring is great for you to hang on a playmat or a baby carrier but wished it was detachable because when she sits on m lap to play with it, the ring gets in the way and it's hard plastic so I'm afraid she might get hurt from it."
5,jacques beats all lamaze products,"I bought 4 Lamaze toys based on their 5 stars reviews, Buzz the Bug, Freddie the Firefly, Mortimer the Moose, and Jacques the Peacock. They are all beautiful and good quality and all have teething rings, squeakers, crinkles, and rattles. BUT to be honest Jacques the Peacock beats them all so easily, my baby only cares about jack. When she was born I show her the High contrast Black and White dots on jack's wings, and she was so mesmerized for several minutes.. While I agree that all Lamaze baby products are good and worth buying, but I think 1 or 2 is enough."
4,Great Entertaining Toy,"My baby loves Jacques. Very entertaining toy, colorful and if you shake jacques it's almost like you're making his wings flap, which my daughter really enjoys."
2,Too bulky for carseat,"With all the reviews, thought it was a great gift. Turns out, my baby boy has no interest. It's too bulky for my Graco Snugride carseat."
5,beauty,"education of good material for babies, of varied color and cheaply. nice, totally what I expected a quality product. light, modern, variety of functions, resistant. good material and economic. good color."
5,Baby's favourite toy,"This toy is my 3 month old's favourite. He bats at it, claws at it, chews on it, stares at it, and is generally entertained by it for a good hour several times a day. The fact that it can be hung up, so that he can't drop it from his chair is a great feature. It also meant that he could play with it (bat at it) before he learned to grab it and hold it. I can't compare it with the other Lamaze toys, but 'Jacques' is well worth the money."
5,Entertains as she grows!,"I put this toy on my baby's changing table when she was just a few weeks old and she loved staring at it. Now, by daughter is 6 months old and she still loves playing with it... it was definitely worth buying!"
4,Lamaze Jacques The Peacock,"We received 3 Lamaze toys like these at my baby shower and after seeing how much my son liked them I bought this one as well. Out of the 4 we have this is his favorite. It seems to be easier for him to hold, he tends to hug it, and the black/white contrast on the back really grabs his attention. He's almost 5 months old and hasn't figured out the squeaker yet but he enjoys checking himself out in the mirror and shoving the ""feathers"" of Jacques in his mouth. It wouldn't make a good teething toy but it certainly has entertained him when we're out and about and besides his baby links this is the second toy I reach for to give him.The only downside to this toy is the clip. I like being able to clip it on everything BUT I like being able to take off the clip too which I cannot do on this item. My other Lamaze toys I can take the clip off."
2,Not so good,"Not really comfortable toy. My 4,5 month old don't get interested in it at all and when she eventually grabs it - it's so obviously uncomfortable for her to play with it, that she quits in few seconds. Not to mention that it looks more like turkey, not peacock :)"
5,Jacques the Peacock by Lamaze,"Yet another great product by lamaze. Our son loves the peacock, he plays with it all the time. We clip it on to his carseat, jungle gym, and anythng else we can."
2,Eh...,"Dont know what was the hype all about. Bought this for my son, he chews it like any other items I would offer to him otherwise nothing special about it. He's almost 5 months old"
2,I doubt this is a Zegna shirt,"I returned it the minute it got home... I doubt this is a real zegna shirt.low quality, flimsy material, stay away."
1,Description states a larger size,"Watch out! The product description says 6 x 0.4 x 9.4 inches. They arrived and are actually 6"" x 6"". I could have purchased the product for less if I wanted the smaller size."
2,BAD Drivers,This printer worked very well using the Windows XP software but when they put out Pac 2 software this printer cas become a dog. Epson has sent me a new driver and it dose not work any better than the old software. The print quality is very good but with the pack 2 software it takesd upto 2 1/2 minutes to start printing which is too long.
5,Shed A Tear,"I am an avid Will and Grace fan and when I saw the series finale on DVD I bought it.I was not 100% in love with the finale - i felt it was extremely rushed into one hour.I think the best part though is how the series was tied back to the beginning (with them sitting on the same chairs talking on the phone to eachother ~ to the bar scene where they do shots).The saddest part (saddest in a good way) was the duet of Megan Mullally (Karen) and Sean Hayes (Jack). That song just puts the series finale into perspective.This DVD is wonderful though I have a feeling the series finale will be included in the final season when that is released on DVD - so this disk might not be a neccessity because it will be included then; however, for those avid fans who enjoy watching W&G; daily - its worth the money.W&G; The series will always get 5 stars from me."
4,Good ending but bittersweet,"The finale was a great ending to a good series. Yes, the last few seasons were uneven in writing, but everything was tied up in this ending. It was so sad to think that 2 best friends and roommates for 25 years would go 16 years without seeing or speaking to each other. While this happens in real life it doesm't have to be the case. Will and Grace could have lived their new separate lives while remaining in touch, at least occasionally. If this had happened though, their kids would know each other and the serendipitous meeting of the son and daughter at college would not have been possible. After the show ended, I called a good friend I had not spoken to in a while, made me want to keep those old friendships active, despite distance and different lives!"
1,Why Buy Last Episode When 6 disc Boxset will be released,Not sure why anyone would just go out and buy the last 45 min episode when a 6 Disc boxset Complete Season 8 with all 23 episodes including this one will be released in the U.K on 7/8/2006!!!!!!!!!!
3,Left feeling Bitter & Sweet,"First of all the ""SPOILERS"" need to knock it off!You are here to review, not spoil the show for others.The final episode should be titled, ""Jack and Karen"". They made the finale for me. Jack's loyalty to Karen was shocking yet touching. I don't think I could have done it. LOLThe ending may make it difficult to watch previous episodes. Grace's decision left me feeling betrayed and disturbed.I can't believe that her character turned out to be so pathetic."
4,Please don't be mad!!,"Of course I can't review this, the episode hasn't even aired yet.. But, I'm writing because I'm upset with all of the people complaining about the release of the finale before the rest of the series. Does no one remember Friends? They released the finale before they released the last few seasons."
5,"Will :& Grace, Final Series",Some of the episodes were predictible but it was a great season even if I would have added some things that I felt needed a closure. For Will & Grace fans its a good gift!
5,Say Good Night Gracie!!!,"What are we to do now that such a controversial, yet heart-warming and hilarious show is off the air. I will truly miss the joy and laughter I experienced each Thursday and will do this knowing it can never be replaced. Goodbye to Jack and his dimwit egotism. So long to Karen and her boozed up superiority. Farewell to Will and his anal retentive sarcasm. Good Night to Grace and her care free quirkiness. It has been memorable."
5,Oh God. Passing another milestone.,"Just finished watching the show with friends and talking about it over dinner. Loved it. I really, really loved it. And I was happy that everyone ends up with the life they deserved all along. And how about that duet between Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes?!! It was beautiful, and I was bummed to see that its not for sale on iTunes.Recently, 'Six Feet Under' finished off with the best series finale I'd seen since the final episode of 'Mary Tylor Moore,' and I was just as happy with this episode. The last few had been pretty bad so I was a little worried about how it would turn out.Thanks for all these wonderful years, guys. I'm really going to miss you."
3,"""The Finale"" episode is included in Season 8 disc set (Lion's Gate).",No need to buy this and Season 8 disc set(unless there are additional features on this product you care to own).
3,Series finale already???,"I was kinda hoping that we would go one season at a time before the series finale but, I guess I'm gonna have to wait a little longer for those... well, I'll be keeping in touch to find out about the dvd release dates of the other seasons..."
3,talk about closure....,"I love Will & Grace, but this finale was very disappointing....not as bad as Seinfeld's, almost as good as Friends' and not even close to Cheers'. Jack and Karen's duet got this the extra star. The end of the finale was TOO much with Will and Grace being old and their kids magically going to the same college with the same rooms and meeting up and probably dating. If I wanted that much closure I would watch the reunion show. It could have ended with them talking again after so many years apart, but the producers felt the need to go WAY into the future to try to enhance the nostalgia."
2,You Have GOT To Be Kidding Me!,"The finale for this show is really bad. It totally unbalances what took many years for this show to keep balanced. We are really expected to believe that Will and Grace stopped being friends for a few years? Come on! Every episode of this show was about how their bond became stronger. And Jack and Karen ending up together? Oh, please! This finale keeps jumping around to different events in their lifetimes. And Vince and Will together? I can't stand Vince! This finale was a total bomb. I gave it 2 stars because of Karen's amazing singing voice near the end."
2,Good pictures -- bad research,The pictures in this book are great. However the captions are wrong often enough to make the book dangerous as a resource for students of American history.
3,The cover is paper,"One thing that I need to point out is that those blue cover are paper although heavy duty. Those chargable ligher looks like a plastic box. You are supposed to put those boxes at the botton of those paper holders.Honestly it still well deserves its price (I have not used it to test the lighting yet). Yet I wonder if there are some opps that we could have instead of those paper lamps, even if it needs a bit more cash.Just my own two cents."
4,Terrific Story,"I love this show when I first seen it, It only goes to show that we can do most anything possible. The actors showed us the insight of their ordeal and very moving story well played by Neil Patrick Harris. More true life stories and survival are a must to give everyone hope if they are in trouble and courage as protrayed in this movie as these people were Thank You for this movie as it is a credit by the director and performace by the actors"
2,Synopses waste of space,"I love the X-Files, and I wanted to read more of the ""backstory"" of each episode.Instead, most of the book is wasted on the synopses for each episode. Usually, 6 pages is wasted on the story summary, and only one page on the backstory.We don't need 6 pages of story summary for each episode: we can watch that! Instead, give us more on the background!"
4,A true x-phile's POV,"I found this book to be very detailed and informative. I own Andy Meisler's X-files guide Volume 3, also, and he just keeps getting better and better. As A true X-phile, I often love to read the little quirks that are often overlooked and even removed from the final cut. This book has it all! Great pictures, too. I especially love the behind the scenes info. If you love Mulder and Scully and all the people behind the greatest show on earth as much as I do, you MUST buy this book!"
2,"Too much sypnosis, too little backstory!",I buy these books to learn the behind the scenes back stories of each episode. unfortunately this official season guide gave extremely long synopses and very little fluff backstory! the backstories were more about bit part actors rather than the behind the scenes of the storyline! who cares! if you to 'relive' the episodes with a legthy synopsis read the transcript for free over the internet instead!
3,Not much new,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. I (of course) have the whole season 5 on tape and so the scripts were familiar to me. I'd have expected more ""behind the scenes"" info from this book. Good for those who don't have season 5 on tape or who are new to the X-Files world, but for me - not much new."
5,A well- written overview of the most fantastic season so far,"This book has great pictures, well- written summaries of each episode, and more behind- the scenes info continuing from Andy Meisler's 4th season book- ""I Want to Believe"". I highly recommend both, and can't wait for him to come out with season six's"
5,Excellent!,"Andy Meisler has written a season guide that has topped last seasons incredible book. He has included so much dialouge that when put with the photos, it's almost as fun to read as it is to watch the show!"
3,Characters are all too androgynous,"I ordered this book based on a recommendation from Tokyopop. The contents are all short stories based on Pamela's card readings for customers...she reads the cards, and then the story shows what happens to the customer afterwards and how it related to the card reading. So there's no real joy of getting to know a character. There's too little, too shallow, of Pamela herself and her male friend whose name I already forget. And all the characters - though beautifully-drawn - are very androgynous-looking, with thickly-done, dark shadowed eyes, lipstick, etc. The only way I could tell whether a character was a man or not was to (a) see if he was referred to as a ""he"" or (b) see if he was drawn shirtless at any point. It was too confusing and too shallow, so I won't be sticking with this series."
5,Rockell at Her Best,"Buy this single if you love freestyle/dance! This has to be one of Rockell's best songs. The beats, vocals, and vocoder sounds are off the hook. This is probably one of the best freestyle/dance singles you could ever own. It's great that they included so many remixes on this single, compared to some of her others. Awesome club or cruising music! Rockell is here to stay. PEACE!"
2,Not sure if the author really said ANYTHING in the first section,"The only reason I am keeping this book is the second section includes over 100 ideas to use in the classroom for reading and writing and reasons for using each. These are a good place for teacher to get ideas to make quality, creative lessons, definitely not a substitution for real lesson plans.The first section of the text was so redundant and simplistic while using heavy vocabulary for no reason. The author seemed to rely so heavily on vocabulary while failing to include any real context. It was a boring read that taught me nothing. I hope I never have to read another of Barbara Walker's books again. It was difficult to dissect the pointless banter to discover what, if any, point was being made."
5,best filter ever,"I bought this from a local supermarket (meijers) about 2 and a 1/2 years ago, when i first got my aquarium. it is lasted sense then with absolute zero problems. well, actually it does have the tendency to get small, weak, and/ or sick fish stock to the intake grill, but that can be expected from any good filter. It has kept the water crystle clear. When i first turned it on, it was so silent that i thought it was broken. If your a begining fish keeper, i strongly recomend this product."
3,Okay filter,"This thing is friggin massive. It takes up a ton of room in the tank. The reason why it's quiet is because the vibrations created by the motor are drowned out by the water around it. After all, it IS an internal filter, somewhat. The water flow is pretty strong. I ditched the flimsy biobags and black foam and just put in my own media instead (which is a lot cheaper and a hell of a lot easier to maintain). The advantages of the filter is that there's so much available space to put media, more than any equivalent HOB filter. the bad part is, it's in your tank and taking up valuable fish/tank space. It's sorta ugly, even though it's black."
3,I think these were 2nds that were being sold cheap,"When we first plugged it in, it was real noisy, I was not happy, I would have paid double for the silence, but after a few weeks the noise went away and it still works months later."
1,This thing is crap!!,"I bought this power filter and it is totally inefficient and a waste of money. My tank water was always cloudy, smelled fishy, and my gravel was nasty! I bought a Hagen Aquaclear and my water was sparkling within 24 hours!"
2,Eye Sore,"I don't often write reviews, but when i do i prefer ...hahaNow, i needed a new filter and was debating between this one and a traditional one (aqueon power 20) with a little tube that sticks into the tank.i decided to get this one because it was a single piece. I figured less parts = easier cleaning.But i missed the point.The choice was not between more or less moving parts, it was between having the entire filter inside the fish tank vs outside of it.This thing is a giant black brick of an eyesore inside my tank.It is huge. Maybe if you have a 50 gallon tank the volume this thing takes up will be negligible.In that case this thing is super quiet and works well. But now i will have to buy some plants to hide my mistake and shame."
4,Solid and inexpensive,"Though recorded in late fifties mono, the sound is solid, as are the conducting of obscure Antonio Pedrotti and the the execution of the excellent Orchestr Ceská Filharmonie.The real star of this recording is David Oistrakh, as I do not recall him playing better"
3,Not strong enough,Not strong enough to pull the pitman arm off a 2500 Dodge Ram.The ball joint separator worked good. This set would probably be fine on a regular car.
1,Safety First,"Low price, nice case, However; This ball joint remover will absolutely not remove the lower ball joints from my 1998 Lincoln MkVIII. In fact, because of the taper on the end that goes on the loosened nut, further complicated by the fact that it is not possible to insert the tool far enough to bypass the taper (at least on this vehicle), while under considerable pressure the tool shot across my garage with enough force to damage anything or anyone in its way. The instruction picture shows the tool being used with the open end of a combination wrench...Good plan because if I had hold of it with the boxed end or a socket I am certain I would be at the doctors right now. It's a shame, I restore cars and I sure could use a tool for this job but fellas, this ain't it. It's got to go back home. It likely works for little cars with lots of room and loose fitting ball joints but...safety first."
4,Great addition to a journeyman mechanics tool set,Not overly expensive and quite capable of doing most front end work. Solid construction and seemed to be engineered better than I expected.Of course it is heavy and takes up a bit of space so you won't be storing it in your toolbox.
4,Nice kit,"I didnt need all the pieces but this kit had what i needed. I may use the other pieces at a later time, so this kit for the price was a great investment. Very hight quality."
2,Not great. barely OK,"This kit is good for light or one time use and will get the job done but when I opened the kit the flexible head on the ball joint splitter just fell off in my hands, its held in place with a thin rubber 0 ring. it still will work but save the headache and search out a better quality kit / tool"
5,Very good,"Very comprehensive set of quality front end pullers. More uses than just front end work. Great value, too. Highly recommend."
4,More then I need,"It was a great price and I have used 3 out of the 5 and they are soled. But the other 2 I have not found a front-end to use them on, but the time may come."
3,Forgotten series,"I didn't known this series before i bought it and i find verry good,a little bit too much for younger audience, but great special effects."
4,StEpHeN ...,"This is one of the most imaginative, insightful, moving, and challenging book I've ever read. Virgina Hamilton writes with her usual brilliant style with a blend of poetic lyricsm and realistic talk. Now Junior Brown is a kid who takes music lessons after school every day and his friend Buddy follows him to each of his lessons but he never goes in cause they are completely different characters. He always just sits outside. junior has a very over protective mother and on the other side Buddy has a mother that isn't very protective. I think that this is a very good book and fully encourages kids around the world to read this book."
4,Really a classic.,"Mr. Bill kicks ass. I love it. Sluggo is cool & Mr. hand is, well just a hand. Spot always get killed & it's 4 hours of abuse. I reccomend this for........EVERYONE. My Favorite dvd is Mr. Bill Classics. I Think the 2 other discs suck."
5,Sizzling latin Jazz,There are a number of tracks on this CD that are very hot. Wide range of musicians who know how to do it.
5,great place to start with Cuban music,"This is clearly Willy Chirino's best. His next best does not even come close. He is a little controversial and is completely banned in Cuba as a Florida right-winger. But I talked to Cubans in Cuba and those particular folk, who are knowledgeable, love this CD and know about the songs on it, although they don't really own CDs much and CD playing boomboxes are a luxury. As for me, I'm not a Cuban--as if that matters--but in things Cuban, sometimes such a disclaimer is demanded. This CD was an early acquisition that put me on the right track. This is not the best Cuban music there is, but its very, very good and accessible for non-Cubans and very rewarding, and well done. The overall production is magnificent. Its the best Cuban music that I know of made outside of Cuba in a generation. And I know a little bit about this subject."
5,verrry good...Te la comiste Willy.,"In my opinion it is one of the best cuban music compilations of all times.It's a relief to the hurting soul of the cuban exiles,therefore I strongly recomended if you like a rhythm that's gonna make you move from head to toe. listen it and enjoy EL SON DE MI CUBA."
3,Kinda Dissapointed,"I must say, the Ultra Maniac anime has dissapointed me. The anime is nothing like the manga what so ever, and I really hate that. There are a few times where it's like the manga... But if you think it's like the manga, then think again, cause it isn't. It's all right though, I enjoyed it somewhat."
5,Good plug for 71 FJ40 Landcruiser w/ F155 engine,"I recently bought a set of these plugs for my 71 FJ40 and they are working great. They all came with a gap of .032 which works out just about perfectly for the F155 engine. It runs much, much better with the new plugs as the old ones were very fouled. I can't recommend these enough. Lastly, they were one of the plugs recommended in the old Haynes manual."
5,Excellent price perfect fit!,Works great for my Honda lawnmower and snow-thrower! It is the original part installed by honda. Installation is very easy and no issues whatsoever.
4,Well made but beware of fragile porcelain,"I have one of these and, like all Ginger products, it is well made and easy to install and mounts sturdily. HOWEVER, beware of the porcelain tray. It is relatively fragile and not suited for rough use. It's great for storing small items like jewelry or cologne or a bar of soap, but if you drop a heavy item on it like an electric razor or a glass, it WILL break. I know, I just ordered an open box item for a reduced price so I can replace the tray. As far as I can tell, you can't buy a replacement from the manufacturer."
1,"Really, just a photo of candles?","I really love the fireplace videos and thought I would like this one, but it isn't a video of flickering candles, as I expected. It is just a still frame photograph of candles...? I really don't get that. The music is ok."
1,Pfftttt....,"Watching candles (not even moving or flickering, just still candles) on a computer screen or TV screen is about as satisfying as looking at photos of FOOD when you are hungry. It takes SOME kind of imagination to parlay that into something remotely 'real' and to consider it romantic is laughable. This should come in a package with a blow up doll and you will be all set for a GREAT ""romantic"" evening. To each his own but even ""FREE"", I regret the time I wasted clicking on this."
1,Really?,"Please don't waste your time. Or money, if you're thinking about buying this. Nothing romantic about still shots of candles."
2,"Music OK, candles are boring","The music is alright for relaxing, background music. The candles burning are very boring in my opinion. I don't know why I would want them on my TV honestly. The crackling fireplace in other videos in more interesting and atmospheric. Three pillar candles on TV doesn't even come close to ""romanic"" as the Romance Edition is advertised. Three pillar candles actually burning in my house would be though."
4,Faster Feathering So Far,"I began using this product for my feather-plucked parrots during their severe molt this year. My Eclectus hens have not had feathers for many years (they were obtained in this very poor condition). Diet made a huge difference, but it was not until I began the Vetri-DMG that feathering was kick-started and I could suddenly see many more blood feathers coming in. Dispensed at the rate of 1 drop for 100 grams of body weight (2-4 drops on a tiny bit of bread) the product is readily accepted. Long term benefits are not yet known; therefore, my star rating may change after product is in use over the next year."
1,Contains Rosemary Extract,"So I bought this to try for controlling/lessening seizures in my dog. However, it contains rosemary extract, which is contraindicated for dogs with seizures. Does it make sense to put an ingredient that is known to possibly trigger seizures (doesn't affect all dogs but some and one is too many) in a product that is recommended for controlling seizures? Wouldn't it be nice if ALL the ingredients were listed before one spends money on something they can't use????"
2,Overpriced copy of the first edition,This book is nearly exactly the same as the first edition except for a few changes to three chapters. It would be more cost effective just to buy the first edition.
3,meh,I ordered this item and I received a different version of the book. The page numbers don't match which is annoying. Other than that the book was in decent condition.
4,"Simple, easy and just what is needed.","I have these for all of my long guns. Simple, easy and effective. Silicone treated so as to resist the moisture. The only reason for four stars instead of five is that these are a big stretch to put on if you have any sort of optics. You can do it, it is just not optimal."
4,great service!,Quick service and great condition! Thank you for being so prompt. This item we gave as a gift to my dad!
5,Protection,Received what I ordered and knew what to expect from the product as I have others to provide protection for my long guns. A simple yet effective sack.
4,El Color de los Suenos is one of her best albums.,"Compared to Fey's other two albums, this one is a little different. She was a bit stronger on her vocals in ""Tierna la Noche"" which I gave a full 5 stars. Her third album; however, you hear her with less emotion than her previous album, but other than that; It's POWERFUL and worth every penny. So ""Ni tu ni nadie podra quitar me lo (el CD) de la mente."" VIVA MEXICO Y FEY."
4,Different kind of rythm but still amazing.,"When I heard that Fey's new cd had a different rythm from her previous 2, I was not so sure if I wanted to buy it or not. Finally I decided how bad could it be? I was amazed that although her rythm was different it was still captivating. The whole cd's beat is slower but tolerable. For me her second cd ""Tierna La Noche"" is her best, ""El Color de Los Suenos"" rivals her first cd ""Fey."" Take a risk and buy it won't disappoint you."
5,El mejor disco del mundo,"El nuevo de Fey es tan fantastico. Con canciones tan movidas y otras que son muy romanticas. Ella tiene una nueve sonida en este album que es tan cool. Esto es mi cd mas favorito de todo el mundo, compralo ya!!"
3,"""el color de los suenos"" is a good cd","fey's new cd is very good. although it could have been better. i think ""tierna la noche"" was a bit better. it had catchier songs and a better beat. but i still like ""el color de los suenos"""
4,Space opera with depth,Most space opera only covers big guns and bigger ships. This series does that and more with aplomb. Definitely recommended.
1,surprisingly awful; cannot finish.,"I really liked 3 princess books by Sherwood Smith, and I like science fiction, so I assumed I would like the Exordium series. I've tried 3 times and cannot get more than 100 pages into it. The bugs disgust me, it all seems way too complex and boring, and I have no sympathy for any of the protagonists. Was this really Sherwood Smith?"
2,disastrous combination af fantasy and SF,"The lyrical infodump is an oxymoron: DO NOT ATTEMPT. Unfortunately, the authors do attempt it, with predictable results. Think of a bad David Weber Harrington novel, and add superfluous description from a bad Mercedes Lackey Valdemsr novel.The result is something like Exordium.To be fair, I never got past chapter 3, so it is probable that the book improves: it has nowhere to go but up..."
3,I just couldn't get into it --,"I read 200 pages and then quit - I kept waiting for it to pull me in, but no go. There are just WAY too many characters (99.5% male - the few females tend to die in fewer than 10 pages, so don't get too attached to them). I got the feeling that machines and words were created just to create them, with no real purpose served.I know others loved this book, but I am glad I only spent $3 on it (and will donate it to the local library).I usually only give books 100 pages to pull me in, but since it got such good reviews, I read to page 200 (but still not worth reading to me)."
5,Transition :one of the best,"I have been a Trout fan since 1984 and think of this as one of his best. It really captures a lot of different styles melded into one. It's a real driving force. It will grow on you with age, if you can keep up!"
2,Get what you pay for,"I guess going for a low priced travel humidor is risky, as you can tell this is cheaply made. The clasp doesn't hold it close, therfore the ""travel"" aspect of it does not work well."
2,So-so,Product has nice appearance. The wood inside has a nice feel. Holds about 10 robusto size smokes. But this unit does not hold humidity very well. Assume you will need to recharge fluids about every 3- 4 days.
5,Amazing!,"I was looking for a low cost method to control tartar on my 9 yr old pom and came across the website for Petzlife. I was very leary about the product; many sites that advertise for ""natural"" products don't work. I went through reading reviews and found the majority in favor. So I figured why not? Certainly it was worth a $20 shot versus a $300 vet bill. I've used it for a week now and the tartar is almost completely gone on my dog's front teeth. She doesn't like the taste either but not enough to fight me on it. I would highly recommend this product. The product so far has not affected her in any way."
1,CAused Liver problems,"This product works - but at the cost of possible liver damage from the alcohol. I have read many places of this being the case, but thought I would try and have liver enzymes tested. Yep, my dog's liver enzymes were elevated, and that was using only half the recommended dosage. No liver problems before. Be aware, use with caution."
4,Pricy but Works,"This product is definitly expensive, but seems to be working on removing plaque build up. I tried the spray first & after one bottle it seemed to cut down on the plaque/discoloration. So I bought the Gel & Spray kit next to save a little money on the two."
2,Seeing no difference,I have used this product on my dog for about a month now. She absolutely hates the spray and I have not been able it very much. I put the get on a washcloth and rub it on her teeth. I have not seen any real change in the plaque build up on her teeth.
2,not worth the money,"I thought I did enough research, but may not have. This product does make my dogs breath fresh for a short time but I have not seen any evidence of brighter teeth. I have been using it along with brushing and the are still very discolored. I really have not noticed any improvement at all. It appears I will have to go back to the vet and have both my pugs put to sleep and have it taken care of that way. This does not make me happy."
4,Clean Teeth - Petzlife,"So far so good. We have used the spray & gel for about 3 weeks, along with brushing about 3 times a week. Our dog's back teeth were beginning to coat with tartar and after three weeks it appears that the tartar is being reduced. 4 stars only because we have been using a short time and don't know what the final result will be."
1,"Beware, has grain alcohol","I bought this for my chihuahua and Chinese Crested girls. I used it for awhile then brought them in for their annual blood tests. Their ALT's (liver enzymes) were high. So, I started checking everything they were getting to see what could cause it. I read about liver enzyme levels and discovered that high ALT's is often a sign of alcoholism. That's when I noticed that a primary ingredient (1st or 2nd) in this product is grain alcohol. Did it cause the liver problems? I dont know for sure. Then years later, in case it wasn't to blame, I tried it again, just a tiny bit, much less than they recommend, on my chihuahua whose teeth were bad. she's a bit old, and I didn't want her to get a reg. teeth cleaning. That night she was woozy, disoriented and swaying around during her walk. That's it. I threw it away and will never use it again."
3,It was ok...,"I bought the Petzlife peppermint spray and gel hoping to use both to help lessen the plaque build up on my small dogs teeth. She doesn't like her teeth brushed so it can be a challenge to do it effectively. I've been using both products for the last 5 months. It does freshen her breath and lessened the color of the plaque but has not removed it. Other reviews stated the plaque ""fell off with a little scraping"". Thus far I haven't experienced that. I think combined with a regular brushing the product will work better, but if you hope to use these products will replace brushing they will not."
3,Petslife Oral Care spray,"Didn't turn my older dogs teeth white, but I did notice a difference after a couple of months, is definitely better than no oral care. Easy to use! Dogs don't seem to mind the taste! Not like a professional cleaning! But it doesn't have to be brushed on so that is handy!"
1,My dogs wouldn't touch this.,"I was really looking forward to trying this product on my dogs but was very disappointed because my dogs wouldn't let me near them when they saw I was getting it ready. I got one of my dogs to swallow it for a few days, but after that, he spit it out and I couldn't get near him with it again. The other dog smelled it and wouldn't let me get near her to even try it once. It didn't work trying to put the gel on their toys."
1,"DON""T ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!",I ordered the Petzlife Oral Care gel & spray and I only received the gel. I contacted Amazon who said I could only ship what I received back for a refund...well I did not want to return it I just wanted my complete order. I contacted the company directly who pushed it back on Amazon and claimed they had zero responsibility. I paid $28.00 and only received half of my order. This should have been a simple customer service fix...send the customer the missing item without making them jump through hoops. UPDATE 11/10/10 I still have not received the spray neither Petzlife nor Amazon would take accountability for the mistake.
2,NO Food Before or After,I would not have bought this product had I been able to read the small print that states the dog cannot have food 1/2 hour prior or 1/2 after it is used. I don't know about most people but we give our dogs a treat after they get their teeth brushed and with this product we can't do that.
5,Great product,Love this product and it really works well when used regularly. My dogs prefer the gel. They do not like the spray being sprayed in their mouth.
2,Dog Oral Tooth Care,"My dog did not like the taste and it does smell different. Althought highly recommend, my 16 yr old sheltie did not like it. Still searching for something that would work."
1,Not worth it.,"When I bought this, the software was not compatible (out of date). Contacted line6 and got a very unfriendly rep. Line6 service sucks, and this IS NOT worth the price. Ended up returning it."
1,Mini Copy,"Book is mini in size. Is that what Collector's Library means?not stated in ad, so I was disappointed. Picture shows book as every other, normal size. However, the book is in excellent condition. I ordered it as I had read it for book club selection and wanted to have a copy of our reads. I kept it, since I hadalready read it and a valuable lesson was learned. ""Collector's Library""."
2,ehhhh iffy gun,well i got itshot really accurately and hardbut after a while stuff began to break on the stockthe cylinder thing on the back broke offbut it was kinda cold that day so it might have been thatbut then the back of the stock just snapped and slid off one daywith the rails that slide the stock following itim going to try to fix itbut other than that shipping was goodshoots goodand one more thing do not use the laser scope doesnt line up with the ironsights and makes it hard to aimbut for 20 bucks good gun i guess
1,AIRSOFT RIFLE,COMPANY WOULD NOT SHIP TO HAWAII WHICH IS TO THEIR LOSS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AS THEY NEVER INFORMED ME AND I HAD TO CONTACT THEM A FEW TIMES TO GET MY PAYMENT RETURNED I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THAT COMPANY AGAIN.
2,Ok gun not the best,"I bought this gun a few weeks ago and haven't used it since. One mag doesn't hold enough, and the other one is hard to understand. I may be a kid but i know what i'm talking about. it really stinks on semi but it's okay at auto. Shoots aroud 120- 150. My advice is don't buy it. look for a different gun!!!! Trust me! Also the scope isn't that hot it's very hard to put on!! it took me 20 minutes and the battery takes 12 long ""hours"" to charge. 12! It's okay for a really begginner, but take my word it's not really good! .2 bb's really slow it down so take .12."
2,this gun sucks!!!!,"I didn't get this gun on amazon but I had the exact same gun but I got this gun at a gun store for $60. The silencer broke on the first day. The brand of this gun is CYMA. The fps is 210 fps with .12s and for a cheap gun, the firing rate is pretty good. Well, that is when it works. This gun lasted me about 7-10 wars and 1 month and it is extremely flimsy. It is super inaccurate. If you want to shoot the guy i front of you, you have better luck shooting the guy next to you The fps stinks and this gun isn't powerful. I shot my 5 year old brother in the neck from 5 feet away and he didn't even notice. When it broke I disassembled it and the gears and the gearbox is very cheap plastic. there is not one metal part in the gun exept for the spring. Now I have a Tokyo Marui mp5 with 300 fps with .20s. It rocks! Its lasting me longer that this piece of trash. Buy this gun for looks and don't buy this gun if you're using it for airsoft with your friends, unless they have trashy guns too!"
4,great gun,"this gun is a great gun;. i have had it for 7 months and it still works fine. the only thing is that i had the silencer on and it snaped off with the tip. that didnt effect at all. i dont know why, but i bought this gun from amazon for $26.99. i guess the price went up."
2,"Decent, but not great...","This gun, while cheap and impressive when you get it out of the box, doesn't necessarily perform well. I was playing with my friends, and I was shooting someone from about 10 feet, and I could see my BBs bouncing off of him, but he honestly couldn't feel them hit him. That's a bit of a problem in my book...Maybe that was just the specific gun I bought, but I wouldn't recommend this gun very highly to anyone wanting to get in wars with friends."
2,SLOW SHIPPING.,"I haven't even recieved the gun yet, but I am so angry at the company right now. I probably should have ordered it here as opposed to on their site, it's $8 cheaper here. But anyway, I paid them $15 for shipping ON A FRIDAY and it didn't even ship until THE NEXT THURSDAY. Now, it's finally in transit but will come days after the airsoft tournament, where I was going to use this. Plus, I feel ripped off becuase their personal site charged me more than amazon. So guys, I honestly wouldn't write a five star review unless I got a free gun or something."
2,CYMA MP5 A5 Airsoft Electric AEG Rifle by CYMA,"CYMA MP5 A5 Airsoft Electric AEG RifleI bought this for my son and didn't realize it was coming from AirSplat until I ordered it. I had a problem with this company in the past and gave up trying to get it resolved so i issue caution when buying anything from them. My son has used this a few times and it is just ok. I would not recommend it, it isn't as powerful as a gas powered gun"
1,Major disappointment,"This gun did not work on arrival. My son has had several other airsoft guns and thought this one would fire quickly and accurately, but it didn't fire at all. The others we have had were different brands,and they all seem to break easily. I would never purchase another one online as the return issue is so much trouble and the chances of needing to return are pretty high."
2,Looks better in the picture,"I could have made this. It's a piece of plywood with about 1 or 1-1/2"" of firm foam stuck to the front. Two triangular pieces of plywood are attached to the back to stand it up. Haven't tried hitting a ball against it, so I hope it stays up. I imagine it will move when hit with a fast moving ball, but I can't say for sure. Also, it's pretty small and lightweight compared to what I was expecting. Not worth what we paid for. I am giving it 2 stars instead of only 1 because I haven't actually used it yet."
1,I gave it one star because they don't allow zero stars,"This album is unbelievably bad. Who are these people that like this band? They are probably the same people who think Dave Matthews Band is a great jam band. (Hint, in order to be a jam band, you have to actually jam.) I have a ton of String Cheese albums, every one is worse than the last. This album sounds like they want to fill the gap left by the Gin Blossoms disappearance from the pop scene.I'd comment on the individual songs on the album, but I couldn't force myself to listen to any of them from beginning to end."
5,Now we're having fun!,"Juicy! I picked my first String Cheese Incident cd from a girl that thought that it would be ""my type"" of music. She was damn correct! These guys have produced some of the most fun and professional music I've ever listened to. Outside Inside is another great studio cd, such like 'Round the Wheel. The whole cd is packed full with excellent tunes. You get everything from a beautiful groove of latin, to a nice bluegrass feel, and fun funk. Other bands have trouble doing what this group has mastered. A personal favorites is ""Close Your Eyes"", which is a simple yet powerful funk song. I've also fallen in love with ""Roll Over"", which can be described as a type of new age jam song, with a electronic twist to it......something that the String Cheese Incident first tried on this cd. Rollover, alone is an experience...never the less, the entire cd. Sit down, get up, drive around, walk about......whatever you're doing, you'll enjoy listening to this cd over and over."
4,outside inside,I think the album is as good as it gets for a studio recording. I still believe the only way to hear SCI is live but they showed alot of their important live elements in the studio as well. The singing is kind of cheesy because its not live. all in all its a good buy because the money goes to the greatest upcoming band around.
3,too much cheese not enough string...,"i love the SCI, this album is all about the lyrics and not enough about the strings. THE LYRICS ARE TIGHT AND I FEEL THIS ALBUM IS GOOD BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE, 1997 - LIVE MAYBE :)"
4,Jerry would have jammed with these guys,"As a Deadhead from the ""college band"" days of '68, I was pleasantly surprised to discover the cheeseheads. This disc is tight, relevant and full of musical virtuosity that is so often missing in performances today. What a range! These guys are great, even straight!!! There are no dogs on this offering. Latinissmo is particularly fine, but hey, savor all of it. I am reminded of the Dead at their best, with just pinches of Lowell George, Little Feat and Tito Puente thrown in.Shine on, you crazy diamonds......"
4,A Different kind of Cheese,"At first listen, this album does not sound like other String Cheese albums, you can hear their sound, but they have gone away from the bluegrass sound to more jazzy and even latin on one song. It is a different album and I have listened to it twice and find that I like it better each time I hear it."
1,don't waste your money,this DVD is complete garbage. It showed each resort for about 20 seconds. most of the time it talks about what to do away from the strip. It was really quite boring in my opinion. Watch the travel channel or buy a good guide book you will see and learn a lot more.
5,Great - A series to get hooked on,"This is the third book of the Pardey's four book Seraffyn series. Once you start them, it's hard to put them down. Lin Pardey has an easy, comfortable, writing style. One is really pulled into their travels."
5,Planning a circumnavigation,"As I returned to this site to order the remainder of the series, I thought I would share the experience. The sine qua non for me in books is well-written. This book is a welcome relief from the average poorly written cruising book. The sailing jargon is a bit daunting, but appropriate. I learned to like these people and would love to meet them and know if they are still asea. I wish that they had a web site like Rita Golden Gelman's, (the author of the great book ""The Tales of a Female Nomad"") to keep us abreast of their latest adventure. They left me aching to get started on my very slow circumnavigation; now, all I need is a captain."
4,Rawlings Basketball is a Good Deal,"The ball only cost me about [...] including shipping. That's significantly less than I would pay for a composite leather basketball in a sporting goods store. The ball bounces fine and I like the additional panels (10 instead of 8), which make for good dribbling and shooting. It has a nice cover which doesn't cause small cuts on your fingers, which happens with the cheaper rubber basketballs."
4,Need Industrial?,"No long explanation. I heard one of their songs on one of the ""Unquiet Grave"" Compilations. This band stood out on that CD. I picked up Biomechanical Disinigration and the rest of their tracks were great. Nothing phenomenally new, but if you're looking for a great Industrial CD with many manic electronic pulsating throughout...get this CD."
3,Size Matters.,"I haven't used it yet because I bought it for a course that was already over, in anticipation for other novels with Spanish words that crop up. I found that a previous purchase for a pocket size Spanish/English dictionary was completely useless in reading colloquial phrases by Chicano characters. But, in my rush, I didn't notice that the size of the book is in a very large format and unwieldy to carry around. So make sure you want a book this size before you order it. Also, the font and page setups are totally unprofessional (self-published?). That really doesn't matter to me, but you could be disappointed if these things matter to you."
2,"Their worst album till now - 2,5 stars",This is by far their worst album. Nothing special at all and i can say that is below an average band. I loved Nemesis and i really liked there other 2 albums but this one is a disaster. Only for collectors
2,Mostly tales...,"I was looking for a book that would serve more as an instructional guide. This book is about 95% stories of others' reported experiences, mainly from the 70's. If you are looking more for erotic reading, this book will serve its purpose. However, if you are looking for more of a directional book, try Trust, the Hand Book."
2,Half guide half storys,"If u want a guide get ""trust"".... First hand is mostly boring stories... I skipped several boring sections....this book should b under $10."
3,Corelli's Vestal Virgin,"Although Maria Callas is famous for her vocal acting, which she does to perfection here, the intrinsic sourness of her deteriorating top notes distances the listener. However, Franco Corelli, a force of nature, is excellent and sings from the heart. Callas will always appeal to the critical intellect, but Franco Corelli's High C's will excite the dramatic emotions. Buy this disc for him."
1,A PROBABLY GREAT PERFORMANCE BUT THE SOUND IS AWFUL!!!!!,"There is absolutely no question that this famous performance was an equally great one --- imagine Maria Callas, Franco Corelli, and Ebe Stignani all together!! ""Vestale"" was one of Callas' La Scala triumphs, and it provided her with the vehicle that opened the 1954-55 season at La Scala. The performance was broadcast, but I have yet to hear this performance in a decent sounding edition, regardless of the company that has circulated it. This is very frustrating because it could have been an invaluable addition to the Callas legacy. As it stands now, however, I cannot recommend this performance even to Callas and Corelli fanatics --- because the sound is so putrid that the voices of these great artists cannot be heard properly. Let it go!"
5,Amazing La Vestale,"Callas Giulia is heartbreaking. No ""declining"" topnotes whatsoever here. Sadly this is the only testament of one of her greatest roles. The cast is exquisite, the conducting fabulous. The sound is so-so, if it mattered one should ""let go"" of the important historical recordings as well. It DOES NOT matter, this is THE La Vestale!"
1,LOOK FOR ANOTHER VESTALE,"This is the worst of the Opera d'Oro recordings that I have heard. No doubt that the stars are wonderful but the sound is SO AWFUL it makes the whole experience terrible. Since I wouldn't give this to anybody, I exchanged it at a CD exchange store. Look for another Vestale, don't ever buy this one. To be fair, Opera d'Oro has some wonderful offers at a very good price and w. excelent sound (Lucrezia Borgia is one of them). But not this one."
1,Abominable acoustics,"To describe the acoustic quality of this recording as very poor would be resolving matters far too heavily in its favor. To put this CD on the market without an easily noticeable disclaimer borders on the fraudulent (is there a disclaimer there that I didn't notice?). As much as I love Corelli, listening to this was auditory torture."
4,Sworn For Mackinaw takes you right to the period,"James Spurr's book takes the reader right into the 1805-1812 time period with its accurate wording, interesting phrasing, and period descriptions. Mr Spurr shows his deep interest and knowledge of history, sailing, and the Great Lakes, weaving a story, mostly factual, that is riveting from cover to cover. He might have included more and better maps, but I can find no other criticism of this work. I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in history, sailing, the Great Lakes, or just a good story."
1,Not accurate,"There is nothing wrong, or even right wing, about demanding accuracy in children's textbooks. If the Amistad had nothing to do with the Middle Passage, it is wrong to teach children that it did. Asking for accuracy does not make one a confederate nor does it suggest that one seeks a return to slavery.Likewise, calling into question the accuracy surrounding passages concerning Harriet Tubman is not to say she was not a great woman. She was. But let's be honest about her accomplishments, please.How can we expect children to respect the truth if they are taught via a history book filled with lies and half-truths."
3,"So, How Do We Teach History Accurately?","I teach history, also. I've looked at this and many other history curricula. It seems that any history curriculum in which all of history is contained in a single text, or series of texts, by a single publisher will contain the strengths and weaknesses of the author(s). This book is not an exception. I've concluded that history is probably best taught with a timeline spine and supplemented with books by as many different, reputable authors as you can find."
5,This book rocks!!!,"In previous years history has been a boring burden. But now I'm using History Alive: America's Past, and history has come alive! Now history is intriguing and one of my favorite subjects. This book is the best!!!Cameron, age 10, grade 5"
3,"Goals, targets and incentives, how to measure it.","I am designing a performance management system in my organization, so i am looking for the best industry practices in order to avoid fall in mistakes during this process."
2,Getting Slimmer Every Edition,"The Mediterranean Europe Guidebook has been getting slimmer every edition for certain countries in the Balkans. And, since the companion volume, the Mediterranean Phrasebook, is no longer available, there is almost utility in buying the new editions for going to the Balkans. The worse coverage is for Macedonia. Nor has what information they have been substantially updated. The maps are nearly useless. Thankfully, maps are easily purchased in the countries. Find an earler edition used"
2,"Nice music, poor recording quality","I like the music well enough, but I have a hard time sitting through it because it sounds thin and a bit harsh. I've tried several of my stereos at home and even my ipods. It seems sad to waste such a talent on a poorly engineered recording."
2,brrrr... leaves me cold...,"Another in a long string of handsomely packaged Nonesuch releases of entirely adequate, workmanlike recent compositions by Steve Reich that leave me completely cold. You Are mainly sounds like a re-hash of ideas from Tehillim and Sextet, while Cello Counterpoint saws away with aimless dissonance just like Triple Quartet did. I always have such high hopes for a new Steve Reich release, remembering the excitement of discovering modern masterpieces such as Music for 18 Musicians, Octet, and Different Trains. I really hope he wows us all again one of these days... meanwhile, like The Cave, City Life, and Three Tales, this CD will just collect dust on the shelf... bah..."
1,"boring, repetitive, unimaginative","i too welcomed steve reich and philip glass in the 1970s, modern composers with something new to say. but the minimalist, variations on a theme, has become tiresome, weary. and to me shows a lack of imagination, creativity, and invention. It is a one trick pony. He has nothing (new) to say. Sit down at a keyboard, pick a sequence of notes, and play them for 20 minutes. bring in a cello or other instrument to help you out, add some variety, and keep playing your sequence. it is sophomoric, simplistic, passing for erudition and complexity. it is not. You want to hear how a genius does this, listen to a few bars from Tristan und Isolde, how Wagner takes a single motive (motif) and weaves it with complexity and inventiveness. Steve could use a few lessons and ideas from the master."
1,arrant garbage,"Others who have said that piece is poor and boring are correct.Reich, just like Philip Glass, has lost his original style that we all loved to hear in the first place. He has replaced his original style with something that must be an attempt to make his music more palpable to a commercial audience. Unfortunately,this ""new Reich"" is very bovine and greatly insipid. I can only hope Reich returns to his true roots =and makes something for his real fans instead of pandering to yuppies."
1,NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL,"I love Steve Reich's music, but now he's old and doesn't have much to say, but has to keep cranking it out. It's not very good at all! Hang it up Steve...you've done more than enough! (Does it get any funkier than Four Organs?}"
4,"Works well, but","They work well for now, but they seem like after much use they could have problems. Only time will tell but I am happy with them for now."
4,A fine anthology series.,I have always loved Tales from the Crypt. Season seven is one of the better seasons released. Like all anthology series this season is uneven. But there are more good episodes than bad ones. It is a good ending to a wonderful show.
5,Tales from the Crypt season 7,"Great horror series. Very hard to find them in stores. Love to watch them, the stories are very interesting. Great price..."
3,Lifting the Lid on Why Restaurants Fail So Often,"Lifting the Lid on Why Restaurants Fail So OftenAlthough restaurant technology has made some these scams less predictable they are still in play. I have discovered these scams in mid stream in my own restaurants but it is always late in the game. The ""Floor Dick"" description, or manager on duty, is a perfect portrayal of an individual whom is clueless to the many scams and schemes being used under his or her own nose. With the average restaurant profit being under 3.5% (if you serve any alcohol it is actually less)you can see why these scams can ""Burn Down the House."" Restaurant customers as well as restaurant employees can learn a lot from this book as well as laugh."
2,Not Applicable,"I did not feel this was applicable in to today's computer age and my restaurant, but will read the next version to see if it is."
1,Just for restaurant employees,"I had been led to believe that this book also included comments about what happens when customers complain about their food. However, it was all about the little scams the wait staff pull to make extra money, usually at the expense of the restaurant. Not having worked in a restaurant, I didn't understand a lot of the scams."
5,My 2 yr old niece loved this book!,"I purchased this book as a ""stocking stuffer"" for my 2 yr old niece and she just loved it! The illustrations were adorable and she had a great time with the ""peek-a-boo"" picture tabs. Fun text. Cute story. She had me read it to her at least a dozen times! I highly recommend this book."
5,Great Book,"This was the only children's book I've found that is about baby not wanting to take a nap. My daughter hates taking a nap, so it's perfect for her. It's very cute."
5,What a cute book,My daughter and I love to read this book. It is a book that everyone can enjoy and I dont get tired of reading it over and over again.
5,very good reading!,"Who finished fourth in the 1999 Winston Cup Championship and as a rookie? Tony Stewart that's who. In this Racing Superstar Series book you'll follow along as only after 25 starts Tony Stewart capture his first checkered flag.As with the other books in the series, this one is also a very quick read. Like the others the book gives a look into the short but promising career of one of the brightest and most talented rookies on tour.As a part of Joe Gibbs Racing, Tony Stewart amassed over $2.6 millions in winnings in his first year and the future looks even brighter. Pick up a copy and take a look into the life of the new millennium of racing superstars."
2,Primal Fear Redux,"Interesting, albeit gruesome. Unfortunately, you can see the twist coming from a mile away, and the film fails to add up the elements once the mystery is solved. The weak ending and one-sided nature of the storytelling makes this an unsatisfying and frustrating thriller. Too much is left unspoken and unexplained. I don't recommend it."
5,Marvellous acting in Redmayne,Redmayne has shown that his career is on the rise for very good reasons. The part is well acted and this is especially impressive for one who read art history instead of drama at Cambridge.
2,Toni Collette is the only reason to watch this,"This is a very uneven film. It starts strong, with good acting and an interesting plot. But it quickly loses itself in its own intricacies and in the end fails to deliver a good, meaningful story."
2,Replaced Product Twice,I have bought this product twice the product leaked out of the bottom both times. It did not leak immediately both lasted about 6 months before they both failed. It does hold a lot of liquid which is why I replaced it the first time. I own many kitchenaid items and I have been reasonably happy with the brand but they really missed it in the quality category with this product. Saved your $$$ and buy another soap dispenser. I rated it two stars because it does hold a lot of soap.
5,this won't do you wrong,"I really like this soap dispenser because it matches my kitchen and I don't have to worry about those ugly soap bottles. My only complaint is that it arrived with a very small scratch on the the side of the rubber base, but other than that it's perfect."
2,Not that simple,The book moves along covering a fictional story in which every thing just falls in place. Sales just isn't that way. I was very disappointed in the book. SPIN is still the book and process. High Prob will get you into alot of trouable and cost you business.
4,Good Ideas but...,"This book is good for a new perspective in sales regardless if you are experienced or not. It gives good insight on how to prospect customers, which for many people is great. However, I think you must take this book with a grain of salt, unless you are willing to put in a lot of hours learning this selling style. My advice would be to take a few things from this book and move on! Easy read."
4,Good quality piece of jewellery,"This is a nice piece. A good medium size and with a satisfying weight to it. The enamel has a deep look and is neatly applied. No chain, though."
3,"Not a bad idea, but...","Enjoyed the premise and plotline. There were a few editing errors that threw me (the P3 is not a ""recognizance"" aircraft), but the basic idea behind the story was good.Others have commented about equipment errors; I'll defer to their expertise."
4,Good casual read,"Good weekend read, not at the top of the genre but I enjoyed it for the price paid. I'll look for other books from this author."
4,Good,I'm very happy with this purchase. It's may not be the finest leather but you get what you pay for.
2,Poor quality leather,I'm not particularly happy with this product. The leather is very low quality and has an odor to it that is not pleasant.
1,Forget about actually learning the language.,"This book is a result of the cutting edge philosophy espousing the idea that the way to learn a language is by mimicking sounds rather than the old boring alternative of actually learning grammer. If you want to really learn a language -- its archetecture, its secret -- do not buy this textbook. Find a good, boring grammar book that will teach you something, like verb forms, pronouns, possessives. That's what I am going to do, having wasted my money on this one. If you want to mimic a few sounds, this is the book for you. Useless."
4,Excellent post-beginner guide...,"It's hard to find ""learning prayerbook Hebrew"" books written for adults, and Golinkin's book fills the bill most capably. It doesn't condescend, and at an unintimidating pace provides a gradual introduction to phrases and prayers heard in almost any synagogue.For those who strictly want to read Hebrew (Golinkin's texts don't cover Hebrew writing at all) and master a few basic prayers, this book is a terrific starting point."
4,"Great band, great music...","This is one of them bands that had something good, it just never got it's chance. ""We are one"" is a great song, as well as others. Give it a try."
3,"Good overall, but one shortcoming in Single Player Mode","I prefer to play single player for most of my computer games. I've had too many frustrating/bad experiences with online scenarios. CoD:UOEP is a little lackluster in the Single Player area. Why? One big reason--there are far too few missions. Everything else is fine--good action and overal game tactics/strategy effects, but I got through this game FAR to quickly. I also think that CoD:UOEP could have tried to have some more stealth based missions.On the plus side, you get to use light machine guns, an interesting if at times cumbersome addition to the overall aresenal."
4,"Probably the best CoD game, and certainly one of the best WWII FPS's","There is something to be said of the immersion factor when it comes to these types of games. The earlier call of duty games, as well as the medal of honor games, really nailed the atmosphere and aesthetics. That look and feel just isn't there in the newer CoD and MoH games. I can't put a finger on what it is exactly that makes the older games funner to play, but I find this to be the case for me.This is a good expansion pack to the original call of duty. The missions are a lot of fun, but the overall content is short. Graphics are definitely below par by today's standards, but it doesn't really matter... it's still a lot of fun to play!"
5,great expansion .,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right. I especially enjoyed the bomber story; action packed."
2,The thing wrong w/ this game is,THE HOLE TIME. i am a very big fan of the call of duty games in fach i have the first one for my pc. A little latter on i bought the expasion 'united offensive' and i was dissopointed some of the things they added just ruend the game. i still love the call of duty games and will get all the expansions that come along but i hope theyle fix it later on
3,Please not another UT2004....,"I've been looking at the info for this game and I can say they're definately trying to mimic UT2004 multiplay. I mean, look at the new modes... Capture The Flag, Base Assault and Domination. Does this not sound like UT to you? And how do these modes fit into a game like Call of Duty?? Modes like Search & Destroy and Retrieval are more creative and make you feel more like a part of WWII. I also heard that they're going to make the guns more accurate and have a higher rate of fire... if so, less skill will be involved, closing the gap between noobs and real players. I don't know about the vehicles yet, but I'm pretty certain that it's just another idea snagged from UT."
3,Not as good as Call of Duty,"Overall I felt this expansion lacked the quality of Call of Duty, at least in single player. Multiplayer I do like, Domination was great with the Jeeps and Tanks. I had to cheat past the third american mission, it was so badly designed and poorly made. I feel Grey Matter screwed up the single player of this expansion. I finished Call of Duty and this expansion became so unfair and tedious i never finished the expansion in SP."
5,Expansion for the 2003 Game of the Year,"let me say this, if you enjoyed Call fo Duty for the PC then this is a must have. it adds over 10 new single player missions and 3 new multiplayer MODES. the multiplayer on the original was great and this is going to add 3 new modes and over 10 new maps. this game also has great mods which are free and add a lot more conent to a game. i say this is definatley a must have!"
2,You need a $300 graphics card to play,"While my amd 2400+ Ti4200 system has held its own through the original Call of Duty, this new expansion pack requires the newest, most expensive card to play it with good frame rates. It was choppy even at 640x480. Overall the game plays like all the worthless Medal of Honor expansions. Oh well, I guess there isn't a title they won't ruin in the name of profits."
4,cool game but bad multiplayer,"The singleplayer was good and way harder than the original, but the multiplayer was bad because not much peaple in it, I think they all went to MOHAA seem to be more peaple over there, I might well go try it see if it work, if u buy call of duty only for multiplayer i warn you go try something else, since there not much peaple on multiplayer i give this game a four."
3,Great Online Play - not been able to play single person,"I loved the first COD and looked forward to this expansion pack. Unfortunately I have been getting an error when trying play the single person and it will not work. I check their website and they have a fix but it would require me reinstall both programs and not use all the multiplayer maps I have installed. I will wait for a patch.On the other hand the multiplayer maps are awsome. The new wepons are great and the tank are easy to drive and very powerfull. The good news even with the tanks it's a well balance game play. Some of the map are very large and some are small with no tanks. The good news it always easy to find an available tank.I brought this game primary for the multiplayer maps, but disappointed that the single player doesn't work. I hope they find a solution soon. I would rate the multiplayer a 5! I will hold off on rating the single person."
3,Doesn't live up to Call of Duty,"I'm surprised the previous reviewers like UO so much. I thought CoD was one of the best WW2 FPS made yet and was looking forward to UO. Unfortunately I feel UO focuses far too much on scripted missions. You are forced into almost preset paths that do not allow for much variance. For example, one mission has you running across a bridge to attack a Tiger tank. You almost have to hit the various spots along the way on the nose or there is no way to successfully complete the mission. This leads to too many reloads and this detracts from the experience. I didn't get this sense from the original game.Of course having said that some of the missions really are amazing and have you do some new stuff but the above points ruined a lot of the fun for me."
3,Good if you love being the Russians,"If you're into being the technology challenged Russian army, this is for you. If you like to actually have a weapon to fire, maybe not so much. I exaggerate. This is a good game with a few more hiccups than the original COD, but there are parts that are just plain awful to try to get through, and I personally got sick of constantly being part of the Russian army. Those parts seemed to drag whereas the rest was fun."
2,Too frustrating to be fun,"Some levels are far too difficult to be fun even on the 'easy' setting--the Foy church tower comes to mind, among several others. It's a thin line between challenge and frustration. It's no fun to do the same levels over and over without result, and it should not be necessary to constantly use cheats to get through the levels."
5,"Played the Demo, Seems Good","I donloaded the demo and United Offensive seems like a good game. Call Of Duty was good, so you could only expect it to get better.First of all, there are new basic weapons, like the silenced Sten. There are also flamethrowers used by the Germans. Best of all, you get deployable machine guns. Every WW2 game should have deployable machine guns.The graphics are enhanced and levels seem to be bigger. I can't wait until I get the full version."
2,Misleading description,"To say this product is compatible with XP & Vista, while not providing a publication date, is very misleading. I assumed it was a product created (or updated) to be compatible with these fairly recent operating systems. However, the software turned out to be from 1998. The instructions contain references to floppy discs.It provides the basic function as described - a place to enter all your personal information. But it is very basic, and very plain - nowhere near the graphical standard of more recent software.A publication date and a screen shot of the product should have been provided."
2,No Battery?,Watch looks great!!! BUT there seems to be no battery. So now I have to take it to a jewler to get one put in it. There was no indication of this in the ad.
3,Fun watch,"I bought this watch for myself ... when it arrived I realized it is a man's watch. My husband did not want it, so instead of returning it I had a hole placed on the strap so I could wear it. It took a little while to get used to it's size, but now I love it. I get compliments on the watch all the time. The only problem is the red insert in the time set dial fell out after a few wears and it's gone. I still wear it though."
4,Not a bad album...,"This album has a lot of good songs to listen too and nothing that stands out after four listens as something I would skip because it's a bad song.I would say the hit song of the album comes at song number 10 'You're So Sober'.If you enjoy music from bands like DMB, you should enjoy The Trews."
2,poor construction,"This was a cute idea so I ordered one for my son. Unfortunately the zipper broke after one day. I was unable to return the product because there was a limited warranty. It was not expensive, but I was disappointed."
2,Golf Bag Cigar Humidifier,The main section that holds the cigars seems fine so far but the zipper on the small outer pouch holding a cutter and/or lighter broke off the first time I used the product.
1,Reliving the Passion,"This book was suggested as a good devotional for Lent. I agree; it is great. Mr Wangerin has a way of seeing the events of Holy Week as told in the Gospel of Mark with new eyes. I look forward to each day's reading for the new light he shines on it. Because Sundays are not counted in the 40 days of Lent, there are writings for Monday through Saturday.The scripture is printed before each day's devotional writing, so there is no need to have a Bible alongside it.This is the best devotion for Lent I have used."
5,"A touching, heartwrenching book!",This book gives a upclose and personal look at the love that Jesus has for us.... it makes you cry and will touch your heart. LOVE it! I will keep it for those days my faith needs a boost!
5,Amazing Love,"This is one of Wangerin's best written pieces. It takes the reader through the Passion of Christ in a way that will not leave you the same. His perspective is from the individuals who were witnesses to the Passion, seen in ways that seem new, but very real. I have gone through this book several times over the years, but this year, made it my Lenten discipline. Reading each day's story, every day, put me there and gives me a greater joy and understanding of how God loves us. I have read no other work that makes Christ's suffering so personally felt. Wangerin is a master story teller and he has made the old, old story very, very new and meaningful."
4,"Stylish, maybe a bit too shiny for typical running around?","My son (9) really likes these shoes. He says they are comfy and ""cool"". I think they look a little to much like shiny plastic, and they aren't as heavy duty as I thought they would be."
2,"Better, but still not up to snuff!","Well, it seems that Fischer decided to perform music that much better suited his level of proficiency on the saxophone. However, he was still unable to add any ounce of musicallity to even the most lyrical of melodies in the Quate. His tone also does not reach the level of brilliance that his former teacher, Eugene Rousseau, shows on the Heiden ""Fantasia Concertante"" on his own CD. I would recommend this CD only if you are a young student who wants to play the pieces with a metronome and along with the CD at the same time, as Fischer does not know the meaning of musical nuance. Maybe he will ask himself whether or not it is time to stop recording and focus on teaching. I will praise Fischer for one thing, This CD does not hurt my ears nearly as much as the first. Happy listening!"
1,Horrible,"I give this one a thumbs down --> if it were a school grade it would receive an F in all catagories. However, this system would not permit a continuation without a star rating"
5,Captures the very heart and soul of the Vietnam experience,"Robert Mason has that rare ability to immerse his reader in the very heart of his story--in this case, the horror that was the Vietnam 'conflict'.His writing strikes the perfect balance betweena detached assessment of the war and a heart-wrenching, mind-bending personal account which powerfully draws the reader into the realities of this horrific war. Incredibly honest and absolutely spellbinding in every way. For anyone wishing to understand more about the realities of the Vietnam War, ""Chickenhawk"" is a powerful 'must read'. Without qualification, my highest recommendation."
4,Hueys at war,"I enjoyed this book. Down to earth, as it was. Deals with the difficult co-ordination required to fly a chopper right up to getting bullet holes in the machine. Personal feelings, friendship and everything in between. Real life that the guy doing the flying but not actually in charge of the aircraft is the guy who loses out on the medals. Some things in life suck, but that's how it is."
5,Excellent book...,"I picked this book up at the library a number of years ago while I was reading various books about the Vietnam War. It was a very good read and told the story pretty well. I especially like the stuff about the training and grouping with other pilots. I also liked the stuff about the emotions as they were going to war.I remember seeing the first part of the trailer for ""We Were Soliders"" as the helicoptor pans across the screen and thinking that they were going to make a movie of this. I wish that were true because I think this book would lend itself pretty well to being a movie."
5,Chickenhawk,The item arrived in good order and promptly too after submitting the order. Paypal also makes purchase very easy with great efficiency!
5,Chickenhawk,This book should be compulsory reading for everyone it shows the courage of young men flying choppers in extremely hazardous conditions while dealing with very incompetent senior Officers and of the lasting effects this had on their future lives
5,Chickenhawk,"I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed this book until I read it again with my 13 year old son.Mason's experiences place you into a world unknown to all but those who were there. His vivid recollections of war, flying, fear, and the balance needed to survive the daily routines and extream personalities left me with a deep respect for the veteran soldier. I'm happy to say that my son enjoyed ""Chickenhawk"" also, and has most of his 8th grade friends reading it."
5,Lived the LIfe,"I never knew this book existed, but being an ex Army chopper pilot with the 1st Cav in Vietnam, I found this to be the most realistic book ever written on this subject. I identified with every single word. Not like the junk you see in the movies.Probably in the top 5 books on any subject that I've ever read"
4,A Flawed Classic,"A book doesn't have to be perfect to be a classic. James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales are a good example. But for its time, this book hit the mark and remains today as an example of what young men go through in the course of exercising their countries political agenda, expecially young men in what was emerging technology in its day--the Huey helicopter. I can still see the scene where they landed in the river to wash the blood and vomit from the deck of their Huey, and I don't think I'll ever forget it. But I too, having been there, was disappointed in the ending. I wish Mason could had done better, but I didn't walk in his moccasins."
5,Great Service,"The service was fast and the book arrived as promised. The story line was not what I hoped for, but was not the fault of the seller."
5,An ABSOLUTE Must Read!,"At first, the flight training section grabs you because you feel like you are in the cockpit with Rob.Then, the story becomes an honest and personal account of Rob's experience in Vietnam. I just couldn't put it down.I read this while in college, and must have re-read it a couple of times since then.I recently met another Vietnam Vet who knows Robert Mason, and he told me some personal stories. These guys are real heroes even though it was a war that we want to forget."
3,book was dirty,the book had candy on it. i think that a little gross but other than that it reads the same.
4,A good book that came within the time frame,"This vendor sent the book as promised and the book was in very good shape. Of course, you have to be patient because it won't come in a week."
3,Breaks easily,"I also bought this vacuum at Sams. It seems to work well but I have had to replace the same part twice. The height adjustment plate is made of plastic and breaks very easily. If you have to carry this up stairs be careful to set it down gently as the plastic on the bottom is not as tough as my kids toys. The replacement parts are not easy to come by, either. I have tried online with no luck and have not had any luck with their reccommended parts retailers. I have been waiting a month on the height adjustment plate and have decided to buy a new vacuum instead."
2,cheap plastic,"everything that can break off has. But it sucks great. Can't roll it across carpet but it sucks great. Handy hose is good, canister inside cracked while gently tapping it to clean it, but it sucks great. If replacement parts are more than $50, I will cut my losses and get something else."
1,PIece of (*&#(*&(#,"Tips over. Almost impossible to empty. After only a year, has started making a horrible sound... seems to be in the beater brush."
1,I HATE THIS MACHINE,"I have always had bad luck with vacumms and this one is no exception. We spent $1600.00 on a Rainbow Vaccum after 1 year (and the warantee was out) it shot craps we took it to a service center and they charged $100.00 for a overhaul well 6 months later it crapped out again and my husband said no more money on that lemon, so we got the Hoover Fusion Plus.It worked fine for the first 6 months and then started blowing out more dirt than it sucked in, I just took it all apart and cleaned everything out with water, don't know if it will work after this but I would highly recomend DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!"
2,Blows more than it Sucks!!,"We got this vacuum about 3 Months ago, and we are already looking for a replacement. My wife is pregnant so I do all the vacuuming. This vacuum picks up alot and I have never noticed it lose suction, but it seems like it always leaves a thin layer of dust on everything after I am done. My wife noticed it blowing dust out of the bottom exhaust by the handle and thats when we put it together. We always notice more dust in our house right after we vaccum. Another not so bright spot is the fact that the exhaust is right by the lifting handle, so if you use it to vacuum the stairs you almost always burn your hand while using the handle to hold it. I probably won't buy another hoover. Vacuums are a ""you get what you pay for"" item."
5,Gettin' Stupid CD,Hilarious CD! Don't even have to like country music to get a kick out of it!!Wish the seller was a bit more honest about the condition- but I was never asked to review the seller.
1,Dear Amazon...,"My complaint is not with the show in any way, my complaint is with Amazon. I find it really frustrating that they are getting pretty cheap in their shipping department. They placed my DVD set into a padded envelope and mailed it that way. Well as you can imagine it was pretty banged up by the time I got it. Not to mention that every DVD holder (the center of the case) was broken when I opened it. So, if like you me, you were completing your collection of the series, may I recommend that you purchase your series from a store and carry it home.Thanks Amazon!That is all..."
3,"Good show, bad production","We enjoy watching Emergency! when t.v. is lacking and have all 5 seasons. Unfortunately, this season is like season 4 and the quality isn't the best."
5,Em 5,Having been a fan of Robert Fuller and Emergency I was over joyed to see the series on DVD. I have watched all of season 5 and ordered and watched season 1 and am waiting for season 2 to arrive. These old series are so much better than the reality shows on TV now. Thanks for the great quality of the DVD's and the opportunity to watch my favorite shows of the past. Great fast delivery and great product.
5,Emergency Season 5,I loved the show Emergency when it ran in the 70's and am glad that the seasons are coming out on DVD. Am really enjoying this product.
3,? quality control,I bought this season even though it had a lot of bad reviews. I really liked the series and wanted it in my collection. I just imagined everything that was green blue.
3,"What Has Universal Done? A Great Show, Bad DVD Transfer","Again, this is another dissapointing presentation for such a great show.Season 4 was much the same. There are no master prints, (Season 4 had one), only syndication prints.It's too bad Universal has given no explanation or out-right labeling on the product itself.One of my favorite episoded is the last on disc 5, and suffers from major horizontal lines going through the scene, like a bad reception off antenna TV in the 1970's.Great show, only get this if you love the show and aren't all home theater crazy for this release. I still love the show as much as when I was little in 1976, so I'm happy just to see these again whenever I want.Who knows, maybe Universal will give us a break if they can find better sources for these transfers, and a re-release."
5,Okay,"After watching the first four seasons, its gets a little boring at times. needed new materials for the season episodes"
5,Good Product,Brings me back to the 70's watching this series. Some of the acting was a little hokey but overall I enjoyed it thoroughly.
3,Great pencil with a fragile tip,"The pencil is amazing. I love the weight and the grip, it is a great price and a great tool. I'm on my 3rd pencil in 6 months (I draw every day in and out of the office) because of the fragile tip. the 1st pencil I dropped and the top bent rendering it useless (the lead will come out broken in small chunks if the tip bends even a little). I didn't complain about it because its my own fault for being clumsy.The next 2 have bent in my bag during day-to-day carrying. I guess moleskines are heavy enough to bend the tips.I would still recommend this pencil as its great, you might want to get a couple though if you aren't going to take care to not bend the tips."
4,Very well made,"The craftsmanship of this pencil is great. I enjoy the little dial by the end to indicate what hardness of lead is in the pencil, although I tend to stick to just one. The tip seems like it could bend easily, but no problems so far."
4,"mediocre movie, great poster","I have a staircase that is now lined with 11x17 Bond posters, but this one catches most people's eye first. Probably because of the suggestive movie title."
2,I can see the stars better with the naked eye!,"It was difficult to put together, and we aren't impressed with the view with either of the two lenses. I should have bought this locally where I could bring it back and have help figuring out if we did something wrong."
4,Stay in place on carpet,These are nice for landing and stepping on. They don't slide around on carpet. My only complaint is they look dirty easily and feel oily or greasy.
4,Sci Fi Classics!,Great assortment of old classics. Your grandkids will enjoy (and probably laugh) at these old thrillers that we loved. Very enjoyable!
4,Great Release!!,"continuing on the style of ""burning ambition"" this release doesnt have the slower tempo great songwriting of the 1st release but it is super high energy uptempo punk. the generators are sounding less like the jam/clash and more like early 80s british oi/punk. a great listen for those who enjoy bands like the Business, cocksparrer, etc."
3,Demanding,"Not Farrens best, very much a product of its time. A loose concept that ends up roughly sprawling like a hippy in a beanbag."
4,A quick read to get you started with the Zone,I needed something to get me started and this book was just the thing. This book explains the principles clearly and simply and gives you just enough to get started and want to learn more.
2,Warning - Recipes Don't Compute,"The book may be easy to read and a good overview of the ZONE diet plan, but... the first recipe I've tried, vegetarian lasagna, turned out to be a disaster. To begin with, the ingredient list is faulty. It calls for 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, but in the procedure, you only use 3 teaspoons. It then tells you to blend the cottage cheese until smooth - what cottage cheese - it was never on the ingredient list? Finally, right when you now know something is definetly off with the recipe and your assembling the noodles, etc. - IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE PAN. So much for 40/30/30 for tonight's dinner and the two hours in the kitchen. The recipe was a good idea and I'm interested in a solution if you ever read this Ms. Gittleman."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This book was easy to follow, and it had some good information. However, the book (pamphlet may be more apropos) was very short. I had an ""empty"" feeling after I was done reading it. In my opinion, this book needed to be more complete."
5,Song of Madeleine,"Readers who long to understand the history behind the tensions of Christianity and Islam will enjoy this spiritual quest novel set in the Second Crusade. Song of Madeleine depicts the Holy Land with its beauty and danger. Lady Madeleine of the French Court finds herself at the center of an unfolding mystery--that threatens her very belief system. This book has it all: history, romance, humor, surprise and spiritual truth."
3,WARNING - Picture is misleading,What you are getting is only the valve not the complete bypass kit. The picture is misleading if you don't catch from the description that it is just the valve in the lower left corner of the picture; my mistake.
1,Deceptive advertising,All photos for this item show a complete water heater bypass assy. All I rec'd was one valve. I feel that I was ripped off and probably will advise the Syracuse office of the NYS Attorney General. Supplier probably will not care!Camco 37463 RV Supreme By-Pass 3-Way Valve Replacement for RV Water Heater Tank
2,Buyer beware,Pictures don't tell a thousand words!....As others have stated. The picture is totally misleading. You only get one valve...How can they get away with this..
2,Binaural Deficiency,"While no one can argue that these compositions are well-loved classics, the recording and engineering of this CD leaves a great deal to be desired. The bottom line -- binaural recording is not what its inventors would have you believe. Perhaps, if you have a styrofoam head, you will appreciate the nuances. But I don't -- and I didn't."
4,Amazingly cheap & works great! Don't pay more!,"This product is great if you need a few more outlets to plug things into in your backyard, and you want to have all the cords organized. The set up is both easy and simply. I gave only 4 stars because I would have liked a cover as an option for weather changes, but honestly, I've had this power stake for months now in all sorts of weather, and have no complaints."
5,I heart Billy,"And i didn't before. I hated the original tae-bo, all the yelling and the ""do it! do it!"" and all these skinny people i could never be. Well I dont know what happened, but Billy's Bootcamp Basic Training is wonderful. He takes the time to break down why an exercise might not be working and when i made the corrections i felt this sudden surge of energy! I felt it working. He's much more relaxed and helpful and keeps saying some very encouraging things. The yelling is by the ""helpers"" in the back and they encourage you to yell which does actually help!My muscles and twitching with strength and enjoyment and all i want to do is do it again and again. You sweat and you yell and you come out better for it. Yes yes yes, buy this product."
4,Tough but you notice results,"This video is tough. He mixes in many different moves into one hour, so its very intense. I only used the bands once and after that I simply continued without them. With that said and probably doing the video like 3 times in one week I did notice some results. I felt tightened and I felt sleek. It was a good feeling. The beginning of the workout had to many squats and there were little recovery time from one different exercise to squats. Overall this is a good video. Comparing it to other videos Billy lacks in the stretching department especially in the end of the workout. I was taught dynamic stretch should be performed in the beginning and static stretching in the end. Billy did static stretches in the beginning which wasn't too bad, but in the end there were hardly enough stretching to compensate for such an intense hour"
3,It's alright,"If you don't have the billy bands, don't bother with this video. They always have someone without the bands in the crew, but it is just way to easy for this one. I've done Billy Blanks stuff before, and I usually like it because it's upbeat and you get to kick a lot. This one however, was kind of disappointing in comparison."
4,its a good work out,it seems so simple when u first start out with this but trust me this is a work out i never realized how out of shape i was until i did this video and realized how much my arms hurt from trying to keep up!
4,Wow. Talk about a challenge,"This is tough if you are only beginning. I (like the first reviewer) used to exercise quite a lot, then for one reason or another, I stopped and now am trying to get back in the swing of it. If you are either not fit or only very moderately fit, this will challenge you, however there is hope. It does get easier the more you do it and I have to say it's well worth it. It gets you sweating and gets your heart racing and that gets the weight off. Challenge yourself and you'll be so happy and the rewards are great."
4,billy'sbootcamp:basivc,Billy BLANK; BASIC TRIANING Bootcamp is one best tape that I ever buy. I loveTHE PRICE TOO.I HAVE SOME OLDER TAPES THAT I HAVE BROKEN.
2,Billy's Bootcamp basic training,I love Taebo workout tapes but you have to pay close attention to the length of the tape. This tape is 55 minutes long with stretching and intros it's easily an hour long. I just don't have an hour to workout. Even if I did I get bored after a half an hour. He has some really good tapes that are only a half an hour and some that are less. I prefer the bootcamp cardio live and the and the ab bootcamp 2004 and 2005. There's also a 8 nminute which is really about 14 minutes. It is great and much more intense than the longer tapes. I sometimes do two of those a day.
1,This is Basic?!,"I got this DVD to get back in shape after a baby and I thought that I was in pretty good shape after doing Billy's older videos, but OMG! Way too fast for ""Basic""! My teenagers couldn't even keep up. It's like it is in fast motion. I wish that I could find more like his older videos on DVD."
2,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed with this DVD. I had Billy blanks Tae Bo from years ago and it was very similar. Had I known...I wouldn't have purchased it.
5,Great all around book on Pocket Billiards,Well writen book on pocket billiards or Pool. Shows how to from the most basic to very complicated trick shots.
3,This episode grows on you; it's still worth watching.,"Previously I wrote a 2(or less) star review for this episode. When I first saw it--after sooo many years I was in a time-flux shock! I couldn't believe the difference in producing a sci-fi adventure 20 years ago and 20 years later.--The fight scenes, etc.. Since then I have seen this show repeatedly and it's grown on me. My shock has worn off. I enjoy watching this episode. I still especially enjoy watching the scenes with ""Alicia"", who is deaf and kidnapped 5 years previously. Her only mode of communication is manually through American Sign Language. I was taken by surprise to hear ""Wilma"" refer to it as HAND TALK. But today when I see that scene in reference I see the past,present and future rolled into one because she mentions a corrective operation children can have to regain their hearing. Today we would especially know one corrective procedure: COCHLEAR IMPLANT. SCIENCE FICTION becomes Science Fact. WHAT A DIFFENCE 20 YEARS MAKES!!!"
2,EEHH BEETY-BEETY-BEET. COULD BE BETTER,"AS A CHILD WHEN i SAW THIS EPISODE I LOVED IT BECAUSE OF THE ACTRESS WHO WAS DEAF PORTRAYING A DEAF CHILD KIDNAPPED AND ENSLAVED. I remember thinking that the futuristic sci-fi shows always showed the futuristic people as having more control of their emotion (Star Trek, Buck Rogers, etc..) Proof was in seing how Buck and his 25th Cent. buds behaved towards each other. What I didn't like this time around was seeing Erin Grey (Gray?) unemotional/underemotional--or underacting? in response to emotional situations. I wasn't taken by how she asked their captors to let Buck and the girl go and they can do anything to her. There were other scenes in which I did like her. Also, the fighting scenes are a little dated. You can tell the actors have little experience with judo or kung fu. Definitely pre-Xena for Wilma Deering! I still enjoy Buck Rogers. I'm waiting to see when Amazon.com gets episodes including the Hawk clan!!"
3,The play is stronger,"I love Nathan Lane and I love Neil Simon. I did not love this movie. This is a made-for-tv adaptation of his play ""Laughter on the 23rd Floor"" and it is strikingly different. While I do think there are some scenes that are stronger in the movie, overall it does not have the same impact that the play does. I'm not sure if Simon was forced to alter the script as much as he did because the studio wouldn't back it any other way, but I'm not crazy about the added scenes. The movie is much more focuses on Max than on the team of writers as a whole and I believe that was Simon's original intention. The cast is decent, and Nathan Lane certainly shines, but there are some goofs with continuity that are a bit annoying. Also, this is very expensive on Amazon. I suggest seeing or reading the original play first and if you get a chance to watch this you can compare the two for yourself."
4,Encouraging!,"A Treasury of Miracles for Friends was such an encouragement for me personally. We, as a family have experienced many miracles. I love hearing how God is at work in others lives."
1,Don't have,Cannot rate this book because I do not own it. Please check the records. It says that these are recommendations for me.
2,Not worth it,"This software is mainly demos that one has to purchase somewhere else to have the actual game. Some games are very similar to each other so, in a sense, there aren't truly 200+ games. If you are just looking for ideas of games to purchase than I would recommend this as something to get otherwise don't bother. It does not contain any good full version games on it."
1,Total rip-off,"This software is a complete rip-off. It is all shareware that must be ""registered"" for a fee on various software websites. This information is in the fine print in a small box on the back of the package, and my wife didn't realize it until we opened the box (thereby preventing us from returning it to Fry's). I am posting my review here on Amazon so that no one will make the mistake of buying this junk software. I wouldn't even give it one star. Total rip-off, and the manufacturer is just scamming people."
1,Pay for more opportunities to pay,"If you like buying stuff you have to pay for again then this software is for you. I found nothing in it I cared about that wasn't a 10 day, 7 day, 15 day evaluation for which you can pay another sum of money (Usually $10) to unlock the secret code and actually play the game. Considering the fact that one can download trial software for free, charging for this disk is a rip-off."
4,okay,deposits color. looks better when combed or rubbed through hair to avoid a creamy look. good quick touch up product.
1,It doesn't work for me,The product is too thick. It won't stay after you conb your hair. My hair is dack brown. It doesn't work for me.
2,Not a good color match,"This Light Brown- Blonde, in my opinion, will only work for you if you have orange/reddish toned blonde/brown hair. It was so orangey, I can't use this and the window to return it has closed so into the trash it goes. If you decide to try one of these products, don't do like I did (which, granted, was not so smart) applying it right before you need to walk out the door and suddenly realize it's time for a touch up. Skip it because if it doesn't match, you have a blotch at your part line that stands out A LOT. Also, the sponge tip seemed odd; not sure how to describe it. I was expecting an applicator more like a mascara or eyelash brush so you could lightly coat hair strands. This created glumped up spots that you had to sort of smear around. Overall a disappointing product for me, but might work on a different color hair with a more patient hand."
1,waste of money,I purchased this cover up also and this did not cover any gray either. Now I know that these kinds of product do not work. A lesson well learned
3,Not as big as I thought it would be,"I had a beat up aluminum roaster that was almost seventy years old and finally bit the dust this year so I need a new one for Thanksgiving. I can't afford to replace the aluminum one as it was huge and others like it cost about 100-200 dollars. So I saw this one for cheap and it said 23pound size so I thought I'd give it a try. It looks great and should work fine but my quibble is with the lid. It's just not tall enough. It will work with a chicken no problem and a small turkey, but a large turkey, although it would fit in the bottom will not allow the lid to cover the roaster so I am disappointed in that. The lid is only half the height of the bottom. Other than that it is a fine roasting pan especially for the small price. When I can afford to do so I will get my more expensive aluminum roaster with the huge dome lid like I had before, but until then this is fine. If the lid height is not an issue for your cooking needs then this should work okay for you."
3,When Mariah Stewart was new...,"Good, solid romantic suspense, not up to her FBI series (Dark, Truth, etc.), but really excellent for what was obviously a new writer. (I got tickled about the recipes.) It's amazing that from early on she 1) wrote in series, 2) had characters grow from book to book, and 3) made background characters full-bodied and interesting. I found I really liked these people, which is always the sign of a good author.If you are reading this because of her latest Chesapeake Diaries books, you won't be disappointed. It really fleshes out these characters and their background.In fact, if you read these first, theHometown Girl: The Chesapeake Diariesreally is even more interesting."
4,Many of Mariah's books are better,"I like fast moving thrillers and this one is far too much about romance for me, but it is still a good and interesting book. Mariah Stewart is a very good writer, some of her books I like better than others. I will continue to read her books any time I have a chance."
5,Mariah,Devlin's Light is an excellent story of love and suspense. I have yet to find a Mariah Stewart book that is not good.
1,Very disappointed ...,"Although I have always enjoyed Mariah Stewart's books, I found Devlin's Light to be VERY boring. Not much for romance, no excitement and a very slow read. When I finally reached the middle, I skipped to the last two chapters and don't feel like I missed a thing! Sorry!!"
4,What Great Remastering,The just a game album is a great and the remastering job they did on it is outstanding it is worth every penny I'm happy not only with the album but also with amazon.com the shipping time was also outstanding the price was right it is so hard to find any of Triumphs albums I ordered two Genesis albums their invisible touch and Genesis the remastering job on those are not any were near that of the Triumph albums.
4,Good album but not the best...,"A late 70's album, TRIUMPH achieved their success on the 80's as a progressive/arena rock band. This album contains some good songs like ""Hold On"" (one of their 2 Top 40 hits) and ""Lay it on the Line"". If you are familiar with the music work of TRIUMPH you might enjoy this album. ""Just a Game"" is a cool ballad but the album overall is from a young band exploring styles. ""American Girls"" is a somewhat zeppelinesque song, that's somewhat weak, but it's a good arena rock anthem. If you are new to TRIUMPH try ""Allied Forces"" or ""The Sports of Kings"" instead, because those represent the band far better than ""Just a Game""."
2,JUST A CD ...,"THis album was recorded in 1978. The only great tune is ""Hold On"" and the instrumental ""Fantasy Serenade"". ""American GIrls"" is one of their worst songs ever."
4,"Before there were hair bands, there was Triumph..","Commonly considered a hair band, Triumph may be singlehandedly responsible for starting a genre. However, setting them apart from the Big Haired bands that followed was a tremendous talent on the guitar in Rik Emmet and a powerful and driving backbeat from the drums of Gil Moore. This Canadian trio set the stage for many wannabes that followed. This album is certainly their most popular album, if not their best."
5,Triumph's Breakthrogh Album Is One Of Their Best Ever,"JUST A GAME, which was the breakthrough album for Triumph, is one of their best ever, featuring drummer Gil Moore and guitarist Rik Emmett equally on lead vocals. The three best songs here are the Moore-sung opener, ""Movin' On"", and two with Emmett on vocals, the inspirational ""Hold On"" and the midtempo ""Lay It On The Line."" There's a line in the latter where Emmett sings, ""I don't ask for much, the truth will do just fine"", which, in light of the original members' opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, could be interpreted as Emmett saying, ""i don't want you to impress me with clothing made in Southeast Asia; being honest will move me more"", a rare attitude in 70s hard rock. This CD is a must own for anyone who loves rock from the 70s and 80s."
4,"""Hold On"" is worth buying this CD","""Hold On"" is one of my all time favorite songs ever.About holding on to your dreams no matter what.I had to buy the album after hearing this one record. I enjoyed the album,but the only other cut I played over and over again was ""Suitcase Blues."" I even recorded this number with my voice for one of my tapes.Its a fantastic song to sing.I never bought any other Triumph records,I don't even know if there still making records,but I wasen't dissapointed buying this one."
4,Rik Emmet's horrible voice?,"Whoever wrote this has got SERIOUS problems. Rik's voice was, and is absolutely incredible! Nothing less! Shame on the guy from BRAZIL!"
3,"""Hold On"" is a guilty pleasure","I'm a big fan of Rik Emmett's guitar playing and buy Triumph CDs used just to get the instrumentals. That being said, ""Hold On"" is a guilty pleasure of mine and a bonus when getting this particular disc. It's probably the best tune Triumph ever recorded: a fine piece of songwriting craft. It turns up on my radio from time to time, usually as I'm about to park the car and go somewhere. Now I can listen to it in its entirety whenever I wish. ""Suitcase Blues"" was a pleasant surprise, too: another example of Emmett's stylistic versatility. The rest of the CD is so-so in the opinion of this non-Triumph fan. Not dissing those of you who like the rest of their work: to each his own."
4,Finding their Groove,"1979's ""Just a Game"" by Triumph is a solid release, highlighted with the standout tracks, ""Lay it on the Line"", ""Hold On"", and the title track. After listening to this album, one could conclude that the foundation was built for stellar albums to follow. A few years later, they released ALLIED FORCES, which is their best album, in my opinion. Still, this should go down as a classic album by an extremely underrated band. Triumph has been a punching bag from critics, especially when the subject of the Hall of Fame surfaces. Triumph (like Rush) is taking it all in stride, because they put out great music for their fans, and that's all that matters. I recommend purchasing ALLIED FORCES, NEVER SURRENDER and THUNDER SEVEN in addition to this CD."
4,Chocolate Designer Inspired Faux Leather Spy Bag / Detective Handbag,great bag... nice leather -- as expected!I just love the style! And i'm glad there is no branding... so it's an authentic Fendi-style!
2,Pretty much what I expected,"I generally find these ""unauthorized"" DVD's about bands to be pretty weak affairs, heavy on talk from journalists and ""insiders"" and lacking any real musical substance or actual film footage of the artists in question. This DVD release on Mott The Hoople is no exception to that rule and pretty much what I expected. There is very little actual film footage of the band and what songs you do see performed are incomplete. With that said however there is really nothing else available on DVD of Mott The Hoople, so I ordered it anyway realizing it would likely not be particularly great. Probably the best part of the entire disk is Morgan Fisher's silent home movies that he took of his bandmates while on tour. The boys are seen climbing (and literally falling) out of cars and generally larking about having fun. He does a voice commentary while the film plays and it is this segment that is actually the most interesting and enlightening part of the entire DVD."
1,"OMG - this is another...""discussion"" CD","Again - old hippies sitting around and ""discussing"" Mott The Hoople. Save your money, folks, it's too hard to come by right now. Listening to someone ""discuss"" Mott The Hopple, SUPURB band that they were, is like looking at a Polaroid of the Mona Lisa."
2,Poor software design.,"The software would not install from the disc. I had to contact the software company to download an executable.Once the software is installed. It is adequate, though not very intuitive. They also have online video links that require you to type in with a complicated product ID 'everytime' you use the link with no way to download the video clips onto your system, should you need them when you are not connected to the internet. That is a poorly designed feature that does not indicate to me that this software was intended for a laptop or mobile device."
5,Lost Family,"I just read this book. It was very moving and insightful. It was so sad that Margaret Taylor, Shirlee's mother, was abandoned by her father,sister and brothers, and endured such a difficult childhood. It took over 70 years for Margaret to find her sister!I think that Grace Cramer's life was more tragic, perhaps, because she blocked out so many memories and isolated herself. I would think she could have at least written her sister, once in 70 years! even if she was nervous about revealing her heritage to other people. It was wonderful to hear that Grace's grandchildren had a happy meeting with Shirlee.The photos are great and the stories about the Taylors, Morrisses etc. are inspiring. It was fascinating to read about African American life in New England and the South. I look forward to reading the book about the Haizlip marriage."
4,Solid thrash if you are digging for hidden gems,"This is NOT bargin bin material like the other review stated. This is solid third-tier (third because of their obscurity, not because of quality) thrash from some of the guys who later formed Misery Loves Co. They have their own sound which might have become tiring if they did it for multiple cds, but since they didn't I find this cd very enjoyable. Lots of killer riffing and some standard raspy vocals (not to the extent of Kreator or anything like that, but he isn't singing either).I'm a fan of this cd. I cannot speak of the re-release with the extra tracks though. I already own the original, so I am hesitant (as usual) to buy something again, but I'm thinking about it if the price goes down. Dive Bomb always does a great job their re-releases, though.If you are a thrash fan, definitely give them a listen."
3,Bargain Bin Good.. This Price Bad..,"Midas Touch was one of many bands who adopted a strong early Metallica sound into their music, releasing one album during the height of thrash popularity. They disappeared soon after, with vocalist Patrik Wiren eventually appearing in the much different Misery Loves Co.. All in all this is possible one of the worst thrash albums i've ever heard. But seeing how I got it out of a bargain bin for 3$ im happy. Jot this down somewhere, You may just find it in a bin yourself!"
5,"Great Game, Great Books",This game wouldn't be successful without the superb writing and information given in these books. It creates a -very- realistic setting for the game.
1,Worst running sock I own,"Other reviewers are praising these socks. These are way better than running in a cotton sock, but for a running sock they are of poor quality. I bought six pair of these and after two months, all but one pair have a hole in them. They also don't provide that great of blister protection compared to other running socks. I run about 15-30 miles a week and these are not up to snuff. Sure they are better than running with cotton socks, but I suggest getting some wigwam or asics sock. Actually, almost any sock at a running shoe store will blow these away."
3,Very predictable but not bad altogether,"This book is very similar to TV murder mystery-in it's writing style. Don't look for deep insights here and you won't be disappointed. The plot and identity of the killer is painfully predictable. The most enjoyable parts are the very realistic descriptions of policework. There is an awful lot of gore & harsh reality that is obviously meant to shock-that it gets to be a bit too much at times. Overall, I give it a ""C""."
3,"""The Middle Ages Compacted""","Morris Bishop's concise survey of medieval Europe covers nearly everthing of primary importance that may be found in the Middle Ages. Bishop's work is an introduction to the general themes of the Middle Ages, and will be a useful resource for beginners. One will discover an excellent representation of every day life in medieval times - the art of war and politics, thought and religion, are treated with uncanny precision. This book is better than most for its clarity and general grasp of the times."
3,Good summary!!!,"This book provides the reader with a great summary of the middle ages and touches on every aspect of it: the history, church, literature, art, chivalry, nobility. Some parts are more interesting than others, but overall a good read!!!"
5,This book is priceless!,"As an entrepreneur searching for funding, I found a lot of gems and solid advice reading this book from cover to cover. The in-depth analysis on everything you need to know on how to get funding is priceless. As far as I'm concerned, the authors have put together the ultimate fundraising handbook. No entrepreneur can afford to bypass this book since this is the best on capturing the essence of raising money the fastest, easiest and cheapest. With a strong dose of common sense and facts, this is an essential guide for start-ups. In fact, maybe the title should be changed to ""Raising Money the Easiest, Fastest and Cheapest."""
4,Terrific guide for the wary entrepreneur - don't be fleeced,"There is a difference between VCs and Angels. And there are several different types of angels with various strengths and challenges. This book helps the reader understand the various types of angel investors and what they expect. It also is very clear about the realities of what happens to your business once the vc or angel investor comes aboard.With the information provided in this valuable resource, the wary entrepreneur can better go after the most approriate resources for the right kind of funding rather than pursuing investors in a random and hapless manner.There is also a section on the flip side - how to BECOME a successful angel investor.This is really good stuff."
2,Angel Investing 101,"This book covered quite of bit of ground, but only scratched the surface. Having invested in my own businesses before, I was looking for usable information regarding angel investing with others. Most of the book was comparing the differences between Business Angels and VC's by referencing studies that have been done (some by author). There are no examples of investments, negotiation, etc to learn from. Quite a bit of generality. The other thing that bothers me with business books is when they add filler to make the book bigger. This book contains 150 pages of lists of Networks around the country, glossary, bibliography, etc. (1/3 of the book) I gave it 2 stars because it has some useful information for someone who has never invested in or started a business before."
4,Good primer on subject,"I am just starting the trek to land Angel investment for my new venture. I read this book through over the last 3 days. It has many insights into the world of Business Angel investing under one cover, although it's greatest weakness is it was published in 2000 so with everything changing so fast I had to take ever line with a bit of salt. Biggest pros: well-researched, balanced reasoning (on a logic/life experience level; I can't yet comment on whether it is in this field), offers a window of sorts into the minds of Angels."
4,WHAT'S AN ANGEL?,"""Angels"" are private financial supporters and other professional underwriting entities who provide more funds to business entrepreneurs than any other source, according to authors Mark Van Osnabrugge and Robert J. Robinson. This book offers ways to bring together those with imaginative ideas and those with the funds to ""finance"" those ideas, for a profit, of course. Do you have an innovative project? a new toy or software product? Looking for investors? Read this book, there may be something in it for you. A matching service is also included in the book."
5,Don't fall into the MuVo trap.,"It is being said that the Creative MuVo MP3 player contains this drive for a lesser price. For one, the price has dropped to about $20 higher than the price of a MuVo II 4GB, and comes with the very useful travel kit.There are alot of people complaining that the Hitachi contained in the MuVo wont work with the Sony F828 camera. This is a myth, the drive in the MuVo players released PRIOR to the Sony F828 where compatible, newer models are NOT.In short, you cannot use this drive which is contained in the MuVo II because it is now incompatible. Dont waste your time, buy this drive, it is a good value.I also do not recommend scouring ebay for an older model of the MuVo which is compatible."
1,Piece of Garbage,"I ordered this a about two and half weeks ago through an Amazon marketplace seller. It worked fine for my digital shoots out of studio for about a week, in fact, I used it on two shoots and all was Ok. Then, it died inexplicably. Nothing I could do could save it - My Canon 20D could not format it, and windows XP couldn't format it. It crashed -plain and simple. BUT - Amazon's stated policy is that there are no returns or refunds to Marketplace sellers after ONE WEEK - so I'm stuck with the piece of garbage. I even emailed the seller who stated the same.Do yourself favor - if it seems too good to be true, it is. I have two IBM Microdrives that have worked perfectly for almost a year each now. If you are shopping for a Microdrive, go with IBM or above all else, buy DIRECTLY from Amazon, not through one of their affiliates."
2,Little bang for your buck,I expected more for my $35. This is a rather short book in which we hear at least as much from the editor as we do from Sgt. Smith. The reason for this is that many of the roughly 70 letters in the book are brief and lack much substance.
3,Could've been better,"I just got my lunch bag that I was anxiously awaiting for. I was surprised by its size. One of the reviews said that it would fit a 6x9 lunch box. It doesn't do so comfortably sitting on the bottom of the bag. You have to shove it in and it doesn't sit correctly (my lunchbox is about the size of a chinese takeout foam container). Basically the bag could've been wider. Unless you're bringing very small containers, or sandwiches, this is not the lunchbag for you."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,Although I'm not a very fast reader - I read this book in one day. It was interesting from the very beginning and I couldn't set it down. I understand this is Pamela Dodd's first book - I hope she writes more.
4,A detailed and efficient thriller,"Pamela J. Dodd tells the story of high school student Angela (""Angie"") Donalson's abduction by millionaire Marc Avery with a detailed, straightforward approach. Angie's new life begins with her harsh imprisonment--capably managed by Ms. Billie Chapman, an ex-Marine who knows how to break people down and build them back up--and quickly moves into a mental territory more remote than Avery's vast estate. As Angie changes, she must decide whether it's for better or worse and whether she has any choice in the matter either way. ""The Gift Horse"" carries us through the resulting emotional landscape with relentless efficiency."
4,Are you kidding me?,"This CD is great! Just buy it! You can not be disappointed. Shoot, get it used from Amazon Marketplace, it's ridiculously cheap! It's a really good listen. Far exceeded my expectations."
2,You have got to be kidding me.,"Ok... let's look at reality here. Colors don't describe and tell your true personality to others. You do... and not through colors. Half of the people I tested this theory on, the book was totally wrong. I can't believe someone would actually think that if they knew someone's colors they would automatically know who that person is. You don't truly know a person until you really get to know them for who they are on the inside... not the colors they wear on the outside. Is that going to make you treat them any differently - the colors they prefer? The world is screwed up enough without another theory to exclude certain types of people."
1,"Hello! A ""Luscher Color Test"" Rip Off","Why hasn't Dewey been cited for plaguarism? Sure, Dewey's a lot more 'pop psych', but not so much as even a nod in Dr. Luscher's direction! Shame on you, Dewey. How long did you think it would take before anyone noticed? Just how much 'research' did you do, Dew? One book isn't enough for a bibliography..."
3,Glad they have an image now.,Just a warning: I ordered this item before the image was added and ordered Original Soundtrack 1 at the same time. They are the SAME thing. Be careful what you order.
1,Does NOT work with Vista. Never Disclosed.,"I bought this adaptor.I opened the box and the first thing I read was""The Windows Vista operating system is not supported by this device.""Here is a link to the product description:http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5D5050-Networking-Ethernet-Adaptor/dp/B000062R4PNowhere does it mention that Vista, a 2007 operating system, is not supported. This is egregiously misleading.Shame on you Amazon!Jeffrey"
5,Great if you don't want to open up your computer to install a NIC card.,"I had a similar USB NIC card that died. I repaced it with this one and am very pleased. These things are hard to find, but of course I found it on Amazon!"
5,should have tried this first,I switched to DSL but didn't have an ethernet card. I spent hours trying to install one and never could get it to work. This was easy. The software was quick and easy to install and the Belkin adapter simply plugs into a usb adapter. It will hold me until I upgrade my computer.
1,Didn't work with a Mac,"I was quite disappointed with this item because one of the salesmen at the Apple store told me to purchase it for my Mac laptop and when it came, I was shocked to realize it didn't work with a Mac."
2,"Well,,,,it works",Purchased this item due to some compatibility issues with my network card and my office. It does the job but there are no drivers for windows vista. /basically that means either constantly plugging and unplugging ny ethernet ord fom this to my ethernet lan on my comp or have two access points in use at all times.It doesthe job but would it hurt to have drivers for Vista?
5,"Good product and fast delivery ,,","Great product , very please with device ,works perfectly and every time.My ethernet port was down and this was the best solutionI am in the Mideast which means using my laptop to keep in touch with family and friends is important.Thank you for your quick turnaround"
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA OR WINDOWS 7,This is an ancient product for legacy operating systems. DO NOT BUY IF YOU OWN WINDOWS VISTA OR WINDOWS 7. It doesn't work on them. Amazon needs to put this in the title of the product.
1,"Works great on XP-SP3 system, but regular BSOD from driver","The Intel ethernet port on my P4C800-E Deluxe motherboard died, so thought this would give me simple ethernet. Installed easily and got me connectivity quickly, but I started getting regular (about once per day) Blue Screens of Death (BSOD). Couldn't decipher the dumps at first, but then saw they mostly pointed to 8511.SYS which is the driver loaded for this system. Went to the Belkin web site and loaded the latest driver, but the Blue Screens kept happening. Finally gave up and switched to an old PCI-based Ethernet card I was still able to buy. Since this device doesn't even claim to work with Vista, and doesn't work with my fully-updated XP system, I'm guessing you shouldn't trust their driver developers."
5,Tivo Owners - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.,"I previously owned the Linksys 200M and it broke with the touch of a feather because of a little plastic door which holds the ethernet cable. I know plenty of Tivo owners will make the same mistake because it is the only one ""certified"" on their website. Do not buy the Linksys 200M. This adapter installed so easily and connected to Tivo perfectly. The design is light years away from the Linksys 200M. Tivo owners - buy this one, you won't be sorry!"
1,Useless,This USB-to-Ethernet adaptor would not install on my Dell laptop. Plug and play thinks it is a bluetooth device of some sort. Belkin tech support could not resolve the issue.
5,Easy Fix For Broken Ethernet Port,"I purchased this product because my laptop's ethernet port was slowly dying and causing an error message of ""network cable is unplugged"" to appear at regularly annoying intervals. This product was easy to install and has allowed me to subvert the problem much more cheaply than getting the port fixed, without causing a noticeable change in connection speed."
5,Lifesaver!,"I recently signed up for cable internet, but could not get the Ethernet port to work (and can't find a driver update - it's an older motherboard). This USB adapter was very easy to install, is VERY compact, and my download speeds have been around 4,000 (my connection is rated for 5,000 max, so not bad since I have USB 1.1 ports, not 2.0)Eventually I might look at getting an Ethernet PCI card or hold out for my long-awaited driver updates, but this solution has been very satisfactory!"
3,Belkin USB Ethernet adaptor,"This product arrived quickly and safely. Product description on Amazon said it worked for Vista, however the packaging material said it did not. Looking online at the manufacturers website I was able to download a driver and successfully install it. The product does work."
3,"Good product, but...","It's a good product, not as nice looking as you'd hope though. Additionally, if you're using 16 gauge (or bigger) wire you may have a hard time connecting the wire to the back of the plate. You have to solder the wire on the back and the hole to put the wire through is just smaller that 16 gauge."
1,Training Guide from Hell,"On the rear of this book it says ""If you are a beginning programmer, new to Visual Basic.... you've found just what you need.' If what I needed was a lesson on how NOT to produce a Training Guide then Mr Murry and Mr Pappas gave it to me. The first four chapters were pretty good explaining about forms and properties etc. As an Access 2/97 trainer most of this was already familiar. However, as soon as you get into the 'Programming' area it begins making assumptions about your level of knowledge. It provides few step by step examples and little explanation of more complicated concepts. The CD was quite useful but concentrated on the areas the book covered quite well and did not touch on anything more complicated at all. This book is by no stretch of the imagingation 'A Training Guide'"
1,"Starts out good, but by Chapter 5 it gets confusing.","The authors of this book did not write this well. The first 4 chapters are excellent, but Chapter 5 throws information that doesn't make sence at you. Then you can't read the rest of the book. An example sentence in Chapter 5 is ""Before a variable is used, its data type must be declared with either the Dim or the Global or Static modifier."" It gives the defenitions for those words later on, makng everything confusing. Don't expect anything good from te CD-ROM - it only has the very basic parts of Visual Basic. I recommend that nobody should read this book."
5,My new favorite author,I've read all of Carolyn Haines Southern Belle books and loved them all so much I did a search to see what else she had written. I've read almost all of her books now but My Mother's Witness: The Peggy Morgan Story is the only non-fiction I've read. It reads like fiction and kept me on the edge of my seat. I am from the south and grew up in much the same time period and I was clueless as to the events from behind the scenes. Ms. Haines did an incredible job of telling Peggy Morgan's story and made me feel as though I was walking beside Peggythrough her life. I've bought several copies for friends I've told about the book and they too had trouble putting it down.
4,interesting and entertaining,"This is an interesting Spanish movie with many plot twists and details involving both the period and the subject of psychoanalysis. It's a little quirky in many ways, but in the end it follows the pattern of many Spanish movies in which one or more of the main characters ends up with someone else."
3,John legend sound of the season,songs are good but too few of them. the cd cost too much for so few songs. he should put out another holiday cd.
3,Charming Anastasia Paper Doll,"This small, charming children's paper doll is a departure from our usual view of Anastasia and suitable for children. It can serve as a ""jumping off place"" for parents to instill a bit of history and Russian lore and folk art to their younger child, instilling a curiosity about Russian history. Good play value."
1,"Tiny Book, Big Rip-Off","This book is approximately 3 x 5 inches. It's TINY, very few pages. Although cute, it's prepriced at only $1.50.BEWARE. This is how Amazon makes $$. I'd return it if it were more convenient to do so."
1,Not what I expected,This is book is tiny. It's price stamped on the book is $1.95 yet I was charged $3.49. I am disappointed to say the least. This book looks like it should be a free sample from a book store.
5,Best Ever,"This Cd is A great CD. I love this band, and the mixing on the cd simply enhances the live experience!!"
1,Can't even SCAN if it thinks an ink cartridge is low,"Honestly, I would love this printer except for the one bugaboo, and it's huge one. The printer tries to track ink usage, but doesn't do so accurately. Then, once it ""thinks"" you may have a low ink cartridge, it stops working altogether until you pony up the money to replace the allegedly low ink cartridge. The issue is that the cartridge may not actually be low. An even bigger issue is you can't SCAN, or do anything else until you pay up. Why do I have to have 6 full ink cartridges to SCAN a picture? (By the way, you can't print in black and white either.)I will never buy another Epson product because of this foolishness. I can't afford to keep SIX cartridges full ALL the time, leaving this otherwise very nice piece of equipment useless to me until I can come up with the $70 plus to replace the cartridges . . . over and over again."
1,don't buy it,"I was in LOVE with this unit until the day it started eating paper [accordion style] after about two dozen printouts. Luckily, I had purchased a warranty that provided a one time replacement, but the replacement that was sent was refurbished, was missing pieces and ultimately had trouble sensing the paper in the paper tray. Never had a chance to test out its scanning capabilities, but now I have 2 dysfunctional printers in my office. Oh, and as a side note, my best friend bought the very same printer and hers doesn't work either. Do yourself a favor [I know it looks sleek], but don't buy it."
1,Enormous paper weight.,"We have had our Epson for about 6 months, it has been not working for 2 of those 6.*In that time we have replaced the black ink 8 times, and a few of the color cartridges too.*It has a terrible paperfeed that jams constantly which is why it is dead in the water right now.*When you run out of any ink the machine is worthless (cannot print black and white if you are out of cyan, or even scan!)*For customer service: I can take the printer to a certified repairman if I want to drive 45 miles each way to do so, but since I don't have my original receipt I would also have to pay for the repair. Whoopee for me."
5,It's a great printer,"I tried many printers, many brands. This one is the best one compare to this price range. If you do not want scanner/copier, Epson R300 is very good too, same quality as RX500. You don't have to go to photoshop anymore."
2,pretty bad printer,"Good functionality, but some problems. big ink blobs on pages, paper feeding mechanism screws up frequently, either advancing several sheets of paper at once or feeding the paper crooked and jamming the printer. Must be highly monitored. images have good tonal gradation, but color is a bit muddy or desaturated. There is no reason why Epson can't do better. And $80 of ink to print 30 8x10s photos!"
2,Not satisfied with this one,"I've had my RX-500 for a year now and continuous paper feed issues, film scanning issues and the ink-suck warm up have convinced me to start shopping for another. (I'm a patient person.)The straw that broke the camel's back was the ink-waste. This is a common issue with most inkjet printers, but the amount of color ink that is wasted is unbelievable to me when I print nothing but black-and-white documents (using the ""black ink only"" selection) for four months at a time. It's either poorly designed or Epson's way of fleecing their customers through ink refills--both signs of a poorly managed product line."
2,Stops printing if you run out of 1 of the colors,"Overall, the printer puts out nice photos, but it will completely stop printing if it runs out of any one of the five colored inks, which is infuriating if you just want to print a document. Right now, I have an almost full black cartridge, but because I ran out of magenta, I can't print at all. What a great way for Epson to make money! Also, the option to print in black only is hard to get to. You have to go into the advanced printer settings to change it."
1,"Decent quality, but handles ink dishonestly. (Really.)","Perfectly dishonest: not only does it INSIST that a perfectly functional cartridge is empty, but you are not allowed to print ANYTHING until every cartridge is present and full.So, if it's an hour before your flight, and light magenta is empty, you won't print that boarding pass unless you've got that cartridge on hand.And, no, you can't print ""black-only"", because that would mean less money to Epson!Not a bad printer to use. Although -- when sharing it across a network -- it uses an annoying proprietary interface that resides in your tooltray. But Canon's no better, and Brother is MUCH worse, all consistent with the tradition of lousy software from printer makers."
2,Less than desirable,"I've owned this multi-function for about two years.Negatives: tremendous ink consumption, expensive epson cartidges, poor function knock-of cartridges, poor quality print in color and B/W, copy function produces yellow copies after much time, paper and document feed often miss-feed (terrible for envelopes). [yes, head cleaning and nozzle cleaning frequently executed.]positives: easy scan function, flat bed scanner,cheap to purchase, good scans of photos."
1,Ink Hog!,I have owned this printer for several years but have only recently come to the realization that thing uses excessive ink. I know that it is not using that much ink to print the one black and white sheet per day that I have been printing. Now I just want to scan something and it won't let me do that since I haven't replaced the ink cartridges.I am convinced that this is just a vehicle to sell people more ink than they really need. I am angered that they have manipulated me in this way for so long but I refuse to play their ink buying games anymore!
3,"Great Stand Alone, Beware Software Problems","This printer was a great stand alone product, but when I connected it to the PC, the software would not install. I worked on it for 2 days, called epson and they couldn't even figure it out. We even downloaded info off epson website. We did eveything but it would still not work with my PC, I have Windows XP. But overall I wished it would have by the pictures I printed off my camera's memory card. Great pictures. But I sent it back to Amazon.com and I am going to reorder another and try one more time to see if something was defective with the first one."
5,Nice item,"Darts were shipped fast and arrived in great condition. These darts had a nice storage case with all items described. I gave these darts to my girlfriend who is not very good at darts, but this seemed to help her game because they are heavier than ""house"" darts and tend to stick better to the board."
4,Not what I expected,I thought this project was a counted cross stitch as described but it was stamped. I think the Bunny sampler is adorable so I'll just buy some 14 count aida and finish it as a counted cross stitch. I was very pleased with the timely manner in which it was delivered.
4,"Very cool for a DMB fan, yet lacking juice","If you are a Dave Matthews Band fan, this CD is really cool. This definitely isn't the right CD for a first time listener, but I know for me as a fan it really helped me to appreciate the original recordings more. The musicianship on this CD is definitely top notch. They manage to play through all the songs without the need of drums for extra background! My ownly complaint, besides length, is the lack of dynamics. As a musician and lover of music I know and can appreciate the importance of crescendos and decrescendos, and that's one reason I love DMB so much. They do a superb job of building and winding down throughout the song which adds a lot to the energy. This Breathe CD, on the other hand, is very musical and creative and together yet it seems to lack that original DMB juice. It is a pretty cool CD that's worth the 15 bucks, but don't expect it to be as great as Dave."
3,Breathe: Can't get enough air?,"Let me begin with saying that this cd is really good music and well writen. With that out of the way, this cd is only 37 minutes long. For Dave Matthews music, this is way to short and i feel that CMH records could have made it a lot longer. The song selection is good, but the brevity really detracts from this CD."
1,"Nice Idea, Poor Result","Just bought this CD and was very disappointed both as a DMB fan and a bluegrass lover. While the muscians on this CD are technically proficient, their strict adherence to the vocal melodies leaves the over all orchestrations rather sterile, especially if one is expecting something akin to the virtuosity of pickers like Fleck, Thile, Douglas, Sutton, Duncan, etc. This CD clearly demonstrates how integral Carter Beauford and LeRoi Moore are to the DMB sound. If you are a diehard DMB fan, then this CD will look nice in your library, but I imagine it will never suffer the wear of routine play."
3,Worth a listen,"I have a very big fan of DMB, I've seen them 11 times and I have total appreciation for their music. This CD only brings up another notch. It is a great CD, but I listened to it once and haven't picked it up since. For a hardcore DMB fan, it's a must have."
1,Breathe: The bluegrass tribute to the songs of Dave Matthews,"Awful, save your money, this is terrible."
1,Just Try and Laugh at This,"I bought this book at a used book store for $2 and feel completely ripped off! I have been an avid golfer for 35 years and love golf humor. There is no golf humor here! I read the entire book and never laughed, or even smiled, once. Absolutely pathetic!"
3,"Good, but not great jokes","I have never played a round of golf and it is most unlikely that I ever will. However, I do understand the game well enough to appreciate how some people feel about it. This is also enough so that I can appreciate jokes that reference golf. These jokes are clean in the sexual sense and largely devoid of swearing, unlike what takes place in the incidents they reference. If you are a golfer, you will be nodding your head in agreement as you read them, if not then you can appreciate the humor expressed about a game that so many feel so passionately about."
2,Tries too hard to not be churchy,This book was extremely distracted. The author tries too hard to be unchurchy and untheological. There is nothing wrong with time honored and historic terms and words. They are yet relavant. If he was concerned about understanding he could have included footnotes and a glossary.
2,confusion,"I am pretty dissatisfied with my recent purchase of this item. I saw that the title of the item was Hartz Frisky Frolic Latex Squeakable Dog Toy assorted characters 1 each. But there was only a picture of one toy. That is the toy I have been searching for. I have previously bought the other two toys from local stores and my dog does not play with them. So when i saw the picture of my dogs favorite toy i decided to buy three. I was surprised when i received my shipment arrived. I understand that the advertisement says assorted characters, but you only show me a picture of one. Show me what you are going to ship to me. The company is willing to refund my money for the two I dont want, but I am going to spent five dollars to get back 10 dollars, and I am still out the additional six dollars in shipping for the 2nd and 3rd squeaky.I would not have purchased this item if I knew what I getting."
1,BEWARE,"Just to let you know- the pictured item may or may not be the ""character"" that you receive. I ordered 3 of these and none was the pictured item. Obzo (seller) response to my complaint was ""We are very sorry but this item is listed on Amazon as being 'Assorted Character 1 Each' because you will only receive 1 toy and we are not able to let the customer choose which character they would like to receive (Assorted). Certainly seems to be deceptive to show only one item and then not have that item be what you recieve. They should, at the very least, show all the various items that you might get. SO... If you don't care which character...fine. If you care...don't order from this vendor."
4,Doggie's Friend,"My doggie loves this ice cream doggie toy. It is the only one he pays any attention to. When you order this toy, you are sent three or four others with it. I tried twice to reorder just the yellow ice cream face toy, but Hartz insisted I get all the others in a pkg deal. Disappointment."
4,An informative examination of the two key founders,"Few books have treated this topic, Madison and Washington's collaboration, and this is an excellent treatment. Unravelling the waxing and waning of this relationship serves well those interested in the Federalist Era. The scholarship is obvious, and the presentaion is good. Those interested in the unfoldings of the Republic must pay attention to the Father of the Country, and his relationship to the Father of the Constituion. Liebiger allows an enormous view of Washington's dignity as a statesman, and Madison's erudition in the realm of Constituion building, amongst other federalist era realtionships, this collaboration was as crucial as any, and a topic long overdue."
2,OK I took one for the team,"Well I bought it blind and paid the price, but atleast it was off a gift certificate. Here are the tracks- Lilys Eyes, How could I ever know, Wick(which had weak orchestration)The Girl I mean to Be, and Hold on. most of the cd's arrangmnts are good witht he exception of wick lacked all the energy that song craves for and being of the male persuasion it was 1 of 2 songs i could sing and both are duets. I was realy hopeing for Winters on the Wing, and Race you to the top of the morning, but no luck. I'll probaly give it away to this soprano who loves the song How could I ever know and try to get some action out of it, overall a disappointment. If anyone knows where i can get the two previosly mentiond song on Kareoke please let me know."
5,The Best Book I've read to help my children,This book has been an excellent book that has helped me walk through the steps of child abuse. Some of the things I love about this book are: ease of reading-easy to understand with suggestions on how to help my children. It has helped me to understand where I am as a parent. Short chapters make jumping around easier. I have young children and this book has been a tremendous help for all of our family.
5,Dust free,These are great ceramic pads and your rims remain black brake dust free. Stopping power is not reduced by them being dust free.
4,the rare stuff,"This was one of the early Aphex Twin records from ten years ago. It was released as two rare EPs. The second one is hard to find. I know this sort of stuff because I spent a lot of the 1990s listening to techno. Luckily for those who own these records, this is a CD only release. Aphex Twin released many records as Richard D. James, but as AFX, it was reserved for often more experimental works, and more obscure. This record documents the early AFX. It often mixes odd drum breaks with the sound of children talking. It's not too different from the recent ""Rubber Johnny"" record. This is worthwhile."
4,AFX - Hangable Auto Bulb,"Well, after only being available on vinyl for the longest time (as well as being hideously expensive because of the limited run), AFX's HANGABLE AUTO BULB is finally here in digital form. And, sure, there's plenty of weird cheekiness--the ""mashed potatoes"" of ""Children Talking"" or the whining on ""Every Day"" give those tracks a silly brightness, but elsewhere, it's the music that takes center stage. The heavy bass throbs of ""Custodian Discount"" give it an extra substance that makes it pop out of the pack, although the aggressive drum programming towards the middle of ""Wabby Legs"" stand out pretty strongly as well. ""Arched Maid Via RDJ"" also has a nice proto-electro feel. The mastering strikes me as slightly odd--the sound seems muffled, or at least not as crisp as you normally hear. So while that's a strike against it, it's always better to have these tracks than not to have them at all."
1,Cheesy book,"I decided to read this book after hearing all the rave reviews about it, and I must say I was pretty disappointed by this book.The plot is all cliche teen drama/romance/action/chosen-one with nothing original. And! Every! Sentence! Ends! In! A! Exclamation! Point! Which ruins what little surprise this book has. Don't even bother with this utterly stupid book."
4,Just the begining of the capitivating series,"This book is written for kids 10-13 only. Though the story may be as amazing as any Harry Potter book, Bobby Pendragon (the main character)says things that only a kid of the age 10-13 would understand, an adult may consider the book poorly written. Using words like dude, but thats all I mean by poorly written. Though a kid his age might actually use those words, so in all it might just count as well studied. I am of this age so this book really appeals to me. This book is actually the worst in the series. Still, I would put it on the top of my list. I have read every other in the series, that has been published,(6 books)and each gets more creative as the series go's on. He truly is a great writer. I am a great fan."
5,YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!!!!,"This is a great book!!When you read this book you will never want to put this book down!There are five books in this series.It has alot of twists and turns.It is also very emotional.This book is welcome to ALL ages. If you want to read this book,I would definitley reccomend that you should read this book!!"
5,This Book Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an awesome book! It is fast-paced and is a page turner. You never know what's around the corner for Bobby Pendragon...Bobby Pendragon is a 14 year old jock and basketball star. Everybody loves him. Then one night his Uncle Press comes to take him away to start his life as a Traveler. Travelers are people who travel around the universe, in different times and spaces, to help out territories in need. Travelers help save Halla - every little thing in the universe. Saint Dane is the person who wants to rule it all. The selfish dog... Anyway, that's how it starts, with Bobby going off to a territory called Denduron. Happy Reading!"
1,Book 1 Pendragon Audiobook review,This book is over acted. It makes it distracting and over emotional way to much. Like a bad teenage action adventure movie trying to have *dramatic* parts. I thought throughout the series that it would get better. Instead of tone'n it down as the series progresses it doesn't. The audio over acting becomes distracting. The story and plot is only OK it isn't grown breaking and doesn't overly draw you in. If i could only rate the book it would be a low 4-3 stars. The series is ruin for me because of the audiobook reader. The dialect of the kids for that time is incorrect. If they have (CD players and internet) they don't talk like kids from the 90s they talk like kids from the 60s with (dude) thrown in there from time to time to sound modern.
2,Poorly written,"This book was not at all how I expected to be. I had gotten good feedback from some friends who had read it, so I tried it. I didn`t even get to 10% before I gave up.The Kindle format is horrible. Every time a word is italicized, there is no space between the word and the word before it, which made it a drag to read. But the writing itself is clearly not well thought out. There is no suspense and the story happens so fast that it is dull. Bobby Pendragon kisses a girl, misses a basketball game, and is on a motorcycle running from a guy named Saint Dane in the space of five pages. Not my kind of book."
3,Pendragon beginning,"Written as letters to home (journal). Book okay, getting ready to start second book."
3,"I Havent Read It , but got different reviews","I havent read this book yet but am going to soon. I have looked at many reviews and some range from THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!! to ""?"" i am going to decide to read it and someone has told me if was fantastic, someone who reads books a day and should have a lot of experience from reading and what is really good or bad. I am giving this 3 stars just because i gave it the benefit of the dout but hope its a good book and not just a come on to harry potterIf your in to science fiction id recomend books by Steven Gould1.Jumper (dont judge by beggining)2. Reflex (sequel) Those books are about a teleport3 Wildside- High schoolers find a way in to an alternate earth (like the reviews for pendragon.)Those are the ones I have currently read by him"
1,The Merchant of Death,"This is one of the very best books I have ever read. A real page turner, the adventure never stops. Ten thumbs up!"
2,Mediocre hanger-on,"I wish I could say that this book were great. Unfortunately, it is merely a mediocre hanger-on of the Harry Potter genre. Meet Bobby Pendragon, our 14-year-old protagonist: he is often conceited, stuck-up, plagued by an inferiority complex, a whiner, and none too bright. Just before he is to play in his school's basketball game, as their ""star player,"" he finds out that he is a Traveler, who will be swept into a tunnel across time and space to save another planet from destruction. His favorite phrase is ""I can't, I can't, I can't!"" The writing is uninspired, the action contrived, and the dialogue clumsy."
3,average at best,if you are a 14 year old this book may speak to you but otherwise it is strictly average
5,An Awesome book!!,"This book, in my opinion is the best book ever; better than Harry Potter!! When you first look at the cover it looks...well sorta odd and then the title doesn't help your mind either!! But once you really get into Pendragon: The Merchant of Death, it gets really exciting and great!! I recomend this book for maybe kids aged 10 & older. I was even scared of the quigs!! Go buy this book now cause its GREAT!!"
5,Only stupid people say there are books better than Pendragon,"If you like unrealistic adventure books you're looking at the right book. The Pendragon series is the best series out there, followed by Remnants. These books make you need to pry your fingers off of the book to do anything else. Just read the books."
4,Don't compare this book to Harry Potter!!,"From the opening lines, this book grabs you and takes you on a fast-paced ride! Its fun, exciting, gritty and real, despite being a fantasy novel. The reason I say not to compare this book to the Harry Potter books is because I don't view them as being in the same class. Sure, they are both young adult fantasy novels, but there is one key difference: Harry Potter reads more like a cartoon. Many of the things that occur and characters involved are deliberately ""fluffed"" (for lack of a better word). Most things come across as cute or charming.McHale has no such compunctions. He leaves things dirty and real. He doesn't idealize his characters or the situations in which they find themselves. Its an incredibly refreshing twist in the young adult genre: a genre that I believe is becoming bloated with cutesy, ""Potteresque"" spinoffs. (read: A Series of Unfortunate Events or The Magickers. What a stinker!!)"
3,A Predictable but Gripping Ride,"The Merchant of Death is a mediocre story written very, very well. The storyline is straight fantasy, but differentiates itself enough to not be confused with the Lord of the Rings or Narnia series (there are a surprising lack of dragons for a series called ""Pendragon,"" but hey, it could be just a last name). The characters themselves are fairly two-dimensional, but with just enough insight and personality to make the reader care for their predicaments. Sadly, though, the most interesting characters (in my opinion), Mark and Courtney, literally add nothing to the plot. Their biggest role in the story is when they make a delivery. That's it. If this seems like a small nitpick, it's not. The entire story takes place from Mark and Courtney's perspective, yet they do nothing.However, this book still has an engaging plot, a unique setting, and some cool action. It's the literary equivalent to a normal action-adventure movie for kids. I recommend it half-heartedly."
5,It was the best series in the whole world,"The book has many twists and turns and I really liked the book. When you think it's over it's not. This book is part of a very long series that provides tons of enjoyment. The writing is great; it has a lot of suspense. The book is about a kid named Bobby Pendragon who does not know that he is going to go on adventures in time and space. He goes to different worlds and tries to stop the evil Saint Dane from creating chaos.This review actually written by Alex, age 9."
5,WOW! PENDRAGON IS AWESOME! READ IT NOW!!!!,"Bobby Pendragon...a fourteen year-old boy with a normal life untill his uncle takes him away to a territory called Denduron. Press tells him he is a ""traveler"" and he must save Denduron from a terrible fate. But why him? He's fourteen. He doesn't even live on Denduron. Why should he help? If you would like to know, read the book! I would strongly recommend it. The action almost never stops, and Bobby is almost always in a life-threatening position. If you want to be in another state of mind and read through a book in one day, this book is for you. I give it a perfect five stars. I usually believe that a five star book is impossible, because no book can be perfect. This book isn't, but a measly four stars isn't enough! READ IT!!!!!!"
2,Poor,"After receiving a few recommendations to read this book and the rest of the series, I picked up a copy. I could not read past the first chapter. The writing style, which I think was meant to help the reader relate to the protagonist, grated on my nerves. The overuse of slang did not help either. I found very little to like about the main character within the first chapter and, as the book is written in the first person, an engaging protagonist is required.There are many better fantasy choices. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Riftwar Saga, the Discworld Series, Good Omens, and if you like the premise of someone being pulled out of the real world to a fantasy world try and find ""A Two-Edged Sword"" by Thomas K. Martin and the two books that follow it, ""A Matter of Honor"" and ""A Call to Arms""."
5,"Bobby Pendragon, a Traveler","This is most definitely one of my favorite series. The story is about a 14 year old boy who lives a normal life. That is, until his Uncle Press comes and tells him he must save Halla(which consists of our universe and 9 other universes including other times.)This book is a scifi, adventure/fantasy book were Bobby is the narrator.I love this book so much."
5,As good as Harry Potter,I picked up this book at Hudsons just to test the series. I ended up staying awake until midnight for several nights to finish this book. It is my FAVORITE book and I quickly finished the series. I have recomende this book to several of my friends and they have loved it as well. This book is truly as good as the Harry Potter series!!!
4,Merchant of Death,"This was a gift to a teen who reads voraciously, at his request. The series has a number of books, which makes a good start."
1,Couldn't Get Past the Foruth Chapter,"I downloaded this book on the Kindle for free, and I was sorely disappointed at the quality of the literature and storytelling. The word ""schlock"" kept repeating in my mind as I slogged through the early material before finally surrendering after four chapters. (Turns out ""schlock"" was the title of one the reviews here.) Given the number of books in the series, I was surprised at the shallowness and triviality of this premier entry.I'm not going to expand on the professional and the higher quality 1- and 2-star user reviews: I agree with most of their points. I wanted to add my 1-star to the stats, and reiterate that there's much more satisfying and engrossing fantasy for teens/tweens available."
2,The mouth piece was dent at the end,"I have to try my way to fix it, it was dropped before the shipping or during the shipping(I can't image it, since the package was good)."
5,Great Pan!,"This is a wonderful pan/wok. It is large but not too big. Its non-stick surface works great. (I have a 14"" titanium wok which is too big and not as non-stick as this pan.) It has the weight of quality cookware but not too heavy to be comfortable. The handles are very comfortable and sturdy. I have the Gourmet Essentials SS set (not non-stick)and love them also. This is a nice non-stick matching addition to the set. I caught this on sale at Amazon for only $19.99--a great buy!"
5,the best plays,"You're stupid. You obviously do not know that Oscar Wilde's plays were comedy of errors and that he was mocking society. You obviously do not know anything about the historical context about the time period when the plays were written in. Go read children's books that you can only obviously understand. Oscar Wilde's plays are the greatest plays written in the 19th century, and many would agree with me."
1,Trashy rubbish.,"""The Importance of Being Earnest and Four Other Plays"" - I only read the play ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" and it shall be the only play I read from this collection. I found this play to be pure rubbish with no redeemable moral plot to it. There was no point to this play. All I got out of reading this piece of trash was how gullible women were during the 18th century and how ashamed I was of the females in this play. I do not recommend."
5,"10""orion reflector","this scope is a plesure to review.When it came it was packed very well.Out of the box it was close to cllimation,took me 10min to complete.The scope is very well built.If you are looking for a big scope built well with goog optics try this one."
4,Good for larger pots,"I bought this as a gift for camping for the bf. We already have a smaller single burner for boiling water in really small pots, so this is a great size for larger pots. We have yet to try it out in the woods but an initial test run at home went well."
5,its a must have,this portable stove is fantastic it is fully adjustable from low to high and my wife likes it too this will come in handy if you need it in a pinch we will use it again if we lose power for days on end
5,Great addition to my camping gear.,"I am a pretty avid hiker/camper. We needed a burner that could use those readily available propane tanks. This one works great and does not take up too much space. Even better, it uses the same fuel as our light uses. I have also used this at the home to steam clams and mussels to avoid smelling up the house. Boils water very quickly and was great to cook on."
5,Great for weekend camping,In love with this little stove. I only go camping once every couple months for a weekend or two and needed something relatively cheap to heat up food. This stove exceeded my expectations. Very sturdy and served it's purpose. It is the size of a larger burner that you'd see on a stove at home so it's not great space-wise for those who like to go backpacking.
4,Great for emergencies,"I bought this burner top for home use and it does the trick. It is relatively large based with soft rubber feet for stability. They protect your table or counter from damage. The lighting and adjustment is easy, and the only limitation is the lowest flame is too much for just a simmer.Best not used for small pans or skillets as the rack will not hold them without being prone to tipping over. Use medium and large size for best operation.In my opinion not durable enough to be kicked around and abused. Has vulnerable areas. Use the original cardboard box for storage."
4,Safe single burner,"I already have both the 2-burner rectangular stoves with lid & windscreen and also the burner-on-bottle product, both from Coleman.This single burner filled my need for something that packs much smaller than the 2-burner, is way safer than the burner-on-bottle and can share a 30x30in dining table.I just used it today for a mini-picnic, cooking hamburgers at the table and it suddenly occured that, duh, its very sociable to cook right in front of your guests.That would not have happened with the other stoves because of size and risks.I skimmed the other reviews and yes, the diameter is larger than expected, verging on a disappointment since I was trying to pack smaller for (small) car camping.I found the smooth continuous flame adjustment to be a much welcome improvement over the notchy adjustment of the burner-on-bottle product from coleman. I'm missing piezo electric start but a butane wand was a competent substitute."
4,Decent burner,"I have had the larger two burner stove in the past which was always frustrating because you could not fit the pans on at the same time usually. This burner is fabulous for the size...will take small pans or larger skillets...and is perfect for coffee. I used it with my new Coleman propane skillet...so they teamed well together. My only complaint would be that it is hard to control the heat as you cannot tell from the dial how low you are going...until the fire goes out...and then you have to re-light it. But, other than that it is much better than the two burner style. If you need two burners...than get two of these. No mess either as it is open and easy to just wipe clean if needed."
3,It does the job,I wanted another burner to add to the the tree coming off my large propane tank. This one will work in conjunction with my coleman two burner setup. It definitely is large but that will be good for holding puts. I plan on using this for keeping something warm while still cooking for a quick heat up of water without having to setup the two burner. It would have been nice to have an electric start like my other gadgets but I carry a refillable lighter anyway just in case the electric doesn't start. The knob is also ok for control. You have low and a very small amount of turning needed to get it to high. Then you can keep turning the knob and it doesn't get any hotter. A lot of knob motion for a short range.
4,Great stove,I use this stove almost exclusively over my two burner Coleman stove. I like the smaller size and that it does not have wind screens - you can use larger pans with this stove. The fire has good control from low to high. The only reason it did not get five stars is the grate could use a bit of redesign - more support for small pots would be nice.
4,"Good, Large propane burner","This is a large burner - one that can easily accommodate much larger pots or pans than my compact 2-burner Coleman stove. It works as advertised - easy to light and easy to adjust the flame. It connects easily to a 16.4 oz propane cylinder. Take note of the product dimensions. This is not a small, backpacking stove. It should work well for car camping, or other uses needing a large portable burner."
4,Coleman PowerPack,This is a great little stove. We use it on our sailboat. It boils water fast and doesn't use much propane.
4,Good burner esp. for emergency or patio cooking,"This burner is a good burner for emergency or when you need to cook at the patio or even on the dinner table. I have been looking for a single burner I could use for cooking on the table. This single burner is a perfect fit for that matter. For outdoor uses, this one may not be ideal as it lacks wind-barriers. However, this is small enough to carry out for picnics. Easy to use, but the instruction says you need to check for leaks using soap water etc... So that is not as simple as an upright burner. However I don't mind as I needed a stable one for pots and fans."
3,City of Fire,"Unnecessarily long, silly and somewhat confusing plot with some very unappealing aspects and a few very beautiful elements. The ""good"" characters don't make sense and are quite annoying. The ""bad"" characters end up being the most appealing, and many of them are redeemed by the end of the book. Because of the few beautiful moments, have kept this in my library."
4,Better Burgers,"Just mix a package of Au Jus with about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs. raw hamburger, form your pattys and cook. It makes the meat taste like prime rib!"
4,Fun Times,"I only have two qualms with this product...#1 the fur slides around very easily on the cuffs and can make it difficult to close them#2 they can't actually lock... they close but the key isn't necessary for opening, similar to the toy cuffs that come with your 6yr old's police man set... i was dismayed to find this outthat being said, the fur and metal are both nice and are sure to spice up anyone's night"
4,Very Good Product,"I have extremely sensitive eyes and tis is the only eye makeup remover product that I can use. You will think you are applying pure water to your eyelids - until you see how well it removes all of your eye makeup, even thick coats of mascara! All the others left either an oily residue that blurred my vision for hours afterward, or a downright red, burning irritation. Not Joey brand, though. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the price. I think it's rather steep for the amount given. Otherwise it is an excellent product."
5,Seriously?! This needs no review....,Five flasks for a pretty low price. what else is there to say other than....one for everyday of the week.
1,"Five flasks are cool, but not if three of them leak and one actually has a damn hole in it","Major disappointment. Bought these flasks for my friends and I to use at Sasquatch this year. Three of them leaked from the cap, and one of the flasks actually had a small hole on it along the edge. We all ended up with whiskey on our clothes after carrying them around in our pockets and bags. Very poor quality."
5,6 oz. Stainless Steel Hip Flask (Pkg. of 5) (Purchased on 02/17/2011) by Americanclocks.com,Much better quality product than I initially anticipated at such a low price!! They were of the same quality that you would find at any retail store. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!
5,"good, cheap flask",I bought the two five packs with some friends. All of them work perfectly. They are small enough to hide in jacket pockets and big enough to have a really fun night :)
3,Does what I wanted it to do.,"I bought this to bring to football games. I wanted something that I wouldn't get too upset about if they were taken away. It was just unfortunate that they did not come with a funnel for handy filling. Also, one of the flasks was VERY rusted over when I received it."
1,Amazon Can't Count,"So the title of this product is 6 oz. Stainless Steel Hip Flask (Pkg. of 5). I received only one. Sure, it seem like a great product, but I'm about 4 short. So this deserves a terrible rating. Don't buy this. I bought this straight from Amazon using Amazon Prime. Not sure why this happened.Some pictures for your viewing pleasure.[...]As you can see on the box, it clearly says pkg. of 5. All I received was one and a box full of packaging.EDIT: Apparently amazon doesn't allow imgur links. Can't blame them. I uploaded a product picture. See top. Emailed them, got a full refund 30 minutes later. Still, I wouldn't risk buying this."
4,These flasks make a great gift!!,"We purchased these flasks as a part of our groomsmen gift and they were just perfect! The quality is fine, I did notice that the cap doesn't screw on as easily as a flask of a higher quality, but it's really not a huge problem. The design is nice and simple and they look very cool engraved."
1,"Leak screw tops, you get what you pay for.","So far, two out of these five flasks have leaked on me, I haven't used the others yet. The metal feels fairly flimsy, you get better flasks in liquor gift sets around Christmas time.Spend a little more money and get a better set."
1,Holes Galore in the Seams,3 of the 5 flasks have holes in the seams. I know these are cheap but they should at least hold liquid.
3,Nice for the price,"I bought this for my boyfriend, as he is always talking about needing a flask. I knew it was coming with 5, and figured it was well worth the price. He can give them away as gifts, or if he looses 1. Well unfortunately he doesnt want it, and to return it i would only get half the price refunded and pay for shipping. Definitely not worth it! So now were stuck with 5, very nice, stainless steel flasks. I would recommend these to anyone, just make sure you know what to do with 5, and make sure you really want them."
5,great for an occasion,i love that it came in a pack of 5 worked perfectly to get monogrammed for a friends first CD release. the top sticks a little the first few times you screw/unscrew it but its really fine other than that.
2,"Ordered a set of five, got one.","Did not get items as described, I only received on honey nectar dispenser instead of five, which prevents me from being a walking pub like I wanted. The one I did get was nice but alas, I had to return it and order a pack of six 8 oz flasks from a third party seller. Two stars."
1,"GREAT DEAL, for one flask","I ordered this item and expected 5 flasks to take with me to south padre island to follow the ordinance that bans glass containers on the beach. However, when I opened the package I only found one flask with a sticker that said ""6oz flask(Pkg of 5)"" I missed the return window and am stuck with a really expensive stainless steel flask that can be found at Walmart for much less."
1,Beware,Did not receive all items purchased and no response to multiple emails. Other than that shipping was fast and products were adequate for price.
1,Ratings more important than customers,"Thank you for the replacement item. However, I feel that you are more concerned about your ratings rather than the feelings of your customers."
1,Flasks leak. Unacceptable.,"Cheap metal is one thing. It's acceptable if my flask's brushed stainless steel isn't smooth (slightly grainy), as it doesn't effect it's use. But these flasks leak. This makes the flask an unusable product. I ordered these in bulk and now must return them."
4,Well-built for the price,"I've never owned a flask before, so I can't compare to what a nicer one would be like, but this seems pretty nice. The metal is definitely dentable but the top is well-built and hasn't come off yet. No metallic taste or anything that I've noticed. Definitely worth getting a funnel to fill this, as the opening is tiny."
2,Kind of a bust,"I bought this and returned it. It didn't do much that I couldn't do with my iPod dock. In particular, the user interface was awkward. This is basically a solution to a problem that doesn't exist for me."
1,It sucks...don't buy!!!`,"I just got this from circuit city and couldn't wait to get it home and plugged in. It sucks!!!! The video quality is terrible. It has stripes running all through it. I switched out the cables to see if it might have been the fault of the cables, but nope...it kept doing the same thing. The remote is terrible too. I had to be about 2 feet from the thing to get it to work...and that was only when I pressed the button about 6 times. Now I can't wait to get it back to circuit city."
2,Works... Sort of,"For the price its fine, basically its a cheap docking station that you can use to play your music with. It will NOT play videos due to the changes Apple has made. So if you want to use it for music, its fine. The remote is a bit small, under powered and slow to react. For $15 this is fine, if it were full price it would have been a ripoff."
3,Good Product,"I have soome problems with the RC, it's so hard to turn on de device sometimes, i think is the battery"
1,Useless,"For anyone with any home networking this device is useless.The biggest disappointment was having to select the video I wated to watch, ON THE IPOD!! not using an on screen guide!!!What kind of Idiot thought that was a good idea?Avoid at all costs :("
1,Do not buy this,"Waste of money. The software is the problem. I hooked it up, turned it on, wasted 5 minutes trying to find any value in it and then turned it off. That was the last time I have even seen it."
2,Not worth it.,Save your money and get yourself something that works. The controls are extremely sluggish. I find myself pressing the same key on the remote more than 3 times at times. Also the video portion did not work with my 120GB iPod Classic. I don't think it's compatible. No screen saver! If you have a plasma be vary cautious with this device.
2,"Dumb, NO VIDEO PLAYBACK..","It clearly says you can play video on this thing right on the box, and I tried it. You have to change your video on iTunes to music video as video type to even get it to show up on the menu. Then it just proceeds to play it like a song with no option for video playback available.Besides that, the scrolling is terrible. Very slowThe look of it is sweet and it looks like it would be a cool product.I would have even been satisfied with any kind of video like a visualization would have been awesome but its actually just easier to get a cable to hook up to your receiver and control straight from your ipod.The remote control is cool too.. Man, this would be a cool product if they just could play videos... I don't get it. Maybe that's why this product is discontinued."
2,needs major improvement,"I bought this instead of the official apple video dock only because this product supports internet radio stations. Big mistake. I have an iPod Video which I want to show movies/videos on my home theatre, and although this has both an S-video output and composite video output, I can't get it to display any video from the iPod. The video output is just for the menu system. But... if you don't care about displaying video then it's not that bad of a product. The remote control is a little weak but will work from 10 feet away. The aluminum/silver finish is a great match to audio system components, and the dock itself is heavy and feels well made. Audio quality is decent, and the video quality of menu system is nice and clear."
4,Pretty Damn Good.,"This is a pretty good cd. I like it because they still sound like the same old Spice Girls, even without Geri. The other thing is: Posh has come out of her shell a little, she actually sings some solo. Also, the song ""The Best Suit For Me"" is pretty funny! I think the change (Geri/Ginger leaving) was for the better. 4 stars- ****."
3,OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I AM VERY DISAPOINTED IN THE GIRLS. IT IS SOOOOOOOO UNLIKE THEM TO COPY SOMEONE ELSES SONGS!!(WE ARE fAMILY) TISK TISK! I HOPE THEY DONT EVER DO THAT AGAIN THAT IS VERY SECOND RATE! i LOVE THEM TO DEATH AND LIKE ALL OF THEIR SONGS BUT i JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAY DID THHAT!
5,I LOVE IT!!,"I Think that the Spice Girl's RULE!! And even though geri left .Mel C is my fave and i love the song she sing's sooo much in it .and i think the song is da bomband it rock's!!..so i am going to virgin record's on dec 1 and buying the ""goodbye"" song i heard it a couple of time's it's great i cant belive they made a song like this.. mama was a sad song and they sang it from there heart's and ""Goodbye"" is just the best ever!..""GoodBye"" is a good song i know it will hit #1 on the chart's..im a verry big fan of them and i have over 500 pic's and i have mostly all of there mrchadise i can get!..so emai me if you want and i guess that's it Byeee...And GIRL POWER!!!!!"
5,It was excellant and it was a well deserved Christmas no1,"When I first heard it I nealy cryed, it was so beautiful.I'm really looking forward to there next single, I'm sure it be just as fantastic as the previous single's.All of there three Christmas no1's have been brillant, everyone in Britain love's the Spice Girls.Also checkout Christmas Wrapping it's catchy.Check them out LIVE!!!!!."
3,IT SEEMS DORKY BUT SAD,This song sounds sad from what I heard but I never heard this songHey all you...
1,"""I LOVE YOU SPICE GIRLS""","hi,my name is Abril Toney and I will like to tell you that your Cd,posters and every thing are tooooooooo! cool ok so I was wondering if you can send me your posters and your ""GOOD-BYE"" cd please I because I belive in you spice girls and I want you to know that and puls I'm NOT! trying to be funny or anything but I like all of you and SCARY SPICE is the one I like the best because shes waaaaaaayyyyy!!!! TO COOL!SO I HOPE YOU GET THE MESSAGE!LOVE THE SPICE GIRLS SO MUCH BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CAN SING ALLOF THE SPICE GIRLS ""OHHH! BUY THE WAY ASK BABY SPICE HOW IS THE BABY DOING!!!! [just jokeing]!"
5,THIS SONG IS GREAT!!!!,"When Geri left, I thought that the Spice Girls wouldn't sound as good, but this song definatly changed my mind! I couldn't believe it was Spice Girls when I heard it. I thought Viva Forever was the best song, but this is almost better! This is a CD I have to buy!"
5,Best Spice Song Yet!,"The SpIcE giRlS have definately hit the nail on the head this time around. This is a great song, lyrics, recording, everthing. They've gone a great job. I love this song. I've seen it like, 20 times on MTV in the past few weeks."
5,This CD's AWESOME!!!,"I love Goodbye!!! When i first saw the video, i was totally shocked, it was such a cool video and the song was totally wicked, i loved it!!! MEL C, MEL B, VICKY AND EMMA CAN DO BETTER WITHOUT GERI!!!"

5,Goodbye Ginger Spice!,This is actually one of my top Spice Girls songs. It is so touching and beautiful. Bravo ladies you did great even without Geri. The video is also amazing and you can see Victoria(Posh) and Melanie B.(Scary) are pregnant. This single is much better than Geri's single Look At Me.
5,I THINK IT IS A GREAT COME BACK AFTER GERI LEFT....,I ALSO THINK IT WAS WONDERFUL IDEA FOR THE NEW ABULM. I ALSO THINK THEY WILL MAKE ALOT OF MONEY OFF IT BECAUS GIRLS AND BOYS ALL OVER NY WILL WANT IT EVEN BEFORE IT ISOUT.
5,AWSOME SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this song! It is so worth buying!!!!!The SPICE GIRLS rule in this song and many others. It is going to be another #1 hit!
5,This is their best song YET!!!!!!!!!!!!,I absolutely LOVE this song Goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's totally number 1!!! I know that when their album comes out it will be number 1!!! Congratulations to Mel G. on having her baby!! The Spice Girls have really grown up in this new album. They sound more for an older group rather than for 8 year olds like their other albums. this one made me a fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"The spice girls are going to be the best pop group FOREVER,","The song GOODBYE its just GREAT!! I think is the best thing the 4 fab could ever do for Geri. The song is so beautiful, with so deep words. I believe is going to be a HIT! The best part of the song is Victorias part,... WE NEVER DREAMPT YOUR GO ON YOUR OWN SWEETT WAY... Its just the best song i ever heard in my life!! BECAUSE IM THE BIGGEST FAN OF GERI, AND THIS SONG GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO BELIEVE IN THE SPICE GIRLS, BELIEVE IN THE GIRL POWER, AND BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE THERE TO STAY FOREVER!! Spice Girls, i just LOVE YOU!!! fROM THE BIGGEST FAN OF YOU Maru , FROM ARGENTINA!!!(cakitas)"
1,This sux!!!!!!,"SUX, it SUX, IT REALLY SUX, YEAH, IT REALLY REALLY SUX. I hate these feminists, girl power my bunghole"
5,Spice Girls RULE,"Everything they do is great, and this shows that they are good, even without Ginger."
5,Interesting Product!,"As the promotional literature claims, these condoms will indeed make your partner's mouth happy! Apparently they do indeed taste good, and I can testify to the fact that they also have a pleasant aroma that make them a welcome change to the often medicinal odor one associates with other, more ordinary condoms. However, make no mistake; flavored or not, these are high quality latex condoms, each of them being lubricated with a reservoir tip, with a range of interesting flavors; Chocolate, Banana, Strawberry, Grape, or Mint. You get a box of three flavored condoms. Enjoy!"
3,Good Company...,but the product was a bit of a disappointment..the taste was a bit off and didnt really last long.
3,Fun to watch...but not original,"The cast of Star Trek salute Gene Roddneberry's life as a policeman seeking inspiration for a sci-fi series he's writing. The story is vaguely similar to ""George Lucas In Love"" and I am surprised no one got sued.It has it's fun moments. The outakes are hilarious though."
2,Nice looking but not very strong!!,"I bought this for my mom, who lives where there are lots of stars visible. There is not much more to see than with the naked eye. The moon is a bit interesting but stars are just little dots and even the planets are still tiny.GET A STRONGER TELESCOPE FOR STAR GAZING!"
2,Biased and outdated,"I read this book here in Brazil.This book is an outdated and anti-semithic book.Even having many true parts, this book ""forgets"" of many things, such as to example:1-The Russian Revolution had german support.Whithout the ""yes"" from the Kaiser, no Russian Revolution.The author (Henry Ford) also ""forgots"" that thousands of rich jews(one of them Lenin's cousin) were murdered by communists.2-Ford forgot the (non-jewish) american support for communists.He also ""forgot"" that then american presiden Woodrow Wilson became mad, during Lenin's government.3-Then, american ""jewish press"" wasn't worse about subjects such as eugenics or racism in USA.The american public decided to buy jewish newspapers and magazines.They were popular.NYT was an egenics' newspaper, but not different from the general american press.4-There wasn't any ""jewsih conspiracy"" to rule the World.Even having some good parts, this book is biased, outdated and sometimes bigoted."
5,One of the best rock albums in recent memory,"Axis II is the debut album by Paranoid Social Club, a Portland, Maine based band made up of some of the members of the now defunct Rustic Overtones. This is easily one of the best debut albums ever, certainly one of the best rock albums in recent memory. The band has an extremely loyal and devoted fan base that grows with every live show. Check out this cd, you won't be able to take it out of your cd player; my copy has been in heavy rotation for 18 months so far..."
5,I want my plain Pop-Tarts,"Why is it so hard to find unfrosted plain Pop-Tarts in stores nowadays? Is everybody so sugar-addicted that they have to have their processed cardboard covered in a hardened glaze of frosting? Actually unfrosted Pop-Tarts can be made much more delicious and even more non-nutritious if you toast them in a toaster oven slathered with butter, so that it sinks down into the tiny holes on top. Yum! Truth be told, my husband must have Pop-Tarts for breakfast, period. At least on Amazon, they can be found in the traditional, unfrosted form--so we became subscribers. Keep those plain, fruit-filled treats coming! I'm still waiting to see my husband dance for joy like the cartoon kids on the TV commercial, but so far, nothing yet!"
5,Just what you expect.,"Family members report that these are more often broken than other PopTarts they've opened. It is as yet unknown if this is due to the lack of frosting or the unpadded shipping box. More research is required.Aside from that, they're unfrosted blueberry PopTarts. Those members of my family that enjoy unfrosted blueberry PopTarts are completely pleased."
5,Pop-Tarts,"So, anyone who went through a childhood in America should have had a least one Pop Tart in their life. These are pretty much the exact same thing, but no frosting! I was really worried at first that the frosting would make the pop tart not as good, but I've got to admit that I'm convinced that these are just as good, if not better. Without the frosting, they aren't as sweet, but you can taste fruit filling a lot more if you're into that (which I am). But be warned: Those who are looking for a more ""healthy"" version of pop tarts are being sorely misled. These contain more calories and higher salt and fat than regular pop tarts. All you're saving is sugar! But if you don't really care about that, then by all means! Pick these up. They'll last you quite a long time."
5,Awesome,I can't find these anywhere on the west coast. They are my favorite flavor and I am so glad that I can have them again.
5,"These were the ""freshest"" Pop Tarts I've ever eaten!!","Plain Blueberry Pop Tarts have been my favorite quick breakfast for years. My kids love them also so they don't stay around our house long.This was my first grocery purchase from Amazon and I wasn't sure what to expect. They arrived in factory carton packed in another box for protection. They had a full year before ""best by"" date and me and my kids noticed right away that they were much tastier than ones we have bought from the grocery store. I think they were fresher than ones that went through warehouses on their way to the store."
5,Awasome,"I have been looking for the non frosted ones forever, so decieded to look on line and there they are. Love them, service was great. Thank you"
1,Screams like a banshee or whines like a power plant,"The bad: I purchased my first Cooler Master RP-500-PCAR and the fan screamed like it was dying. I returned it, and the replacement was worse. This replacement's fan is very quiet, but the power supply has a loud and unbearable high pitched electronic whine that can be heard in the next room. I would say there are serious quality issues with this brand, and I can't recommend Cooler Master to anyone that isn't totally deaf. It's going in the trash this afternoon because no reasonable human can endure the painful sound.The good: Well, ugh, it had a nice picture on the box. That's about it."
1,bad construction,"The unit does not appear to exhibit any gain whatsoever. On opening the box and checking the construction, it appears to be a mass of solder blobs. The output is not a dual amplifier, but a single amp split - which does not seem to agree with the add."
3,Better?,"I had a 12 db amp for my outside antenna, living on a fringe area for tv reception. I decided to try out a24 db amp. Picture was definitely better; except for channel 11 VHF, I couldn't pull it in. All the other channelscame in good, 2,4,7,9,13, but channel 11 refused to come in clear. Had to go back to my 12db amp and gotit good. Must have been a drop out inside the amp for channel 11. To cheap to send back, so I guess I'lljunk it or keep it as a partial spare amp. :-("
3,It does what it should ...,I purchase this product because I use rabbit ears (Philips) with an amplifier and am in a rural area. I used to get 5 channels before the local PBS lost it's analog antenna ... now ... I only get 4. The product help reduce the snow in the UHF channels ... very little help for the VHF channel ... I wasn't expecting any miracles from it ... but it did help. I get a little bit better picture. Now as far as digital ... that's another story ... I have to use a converter box ... I get a fantastic picture ... like cable ... but it's all or nothing with digital ... so I only get ONE station! Rabbit ears ... amp or no ... just doesn't cut it in a rural area ... I must have a outdoor deep fringe antenna to get a decent picture in my area. The only thing I don't like about the product is ... no on off switch ... and no control of the amplification.
1,Gave me lower signal strength,"After hooking up my DTV converter box my signal strength was at 50-60%. After hooking up this amp my signal dropped to 19%, at best, and lost 5 channels!"
3,not good not bad,"Didnt really noticed any improvement on my signal, the seller was very quick to ship it"
4,A good product for the money,I enjoy my TV line amplifier very much. The picture is abt. 20% better. I have been very pleased with every Amazon.com product I have bought.
5,GREAT OPTIONS FOR CREATING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACHIEVE MORE,"THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FUTURE is the best compilation of essays that I have seen on different ways to organize businesses and nonprofits to achieve different kinds of results. The book is full of intriguing questions and choices, and lots of good ideas about how to make the desired changes you select. Anyone who manages people should read this book, and refer to it when effectiveness questions arise. The only thing that seemed to be missing from this book was a ""clean slate"" approach to organizations, by imagining what has never existed before. That would be an intriguing addition for future editions. The Drucker Foundation has done a real service to us all by creating its series (THE LEADER ..., THE ORGANIZATION ..., and THE COMMUNITY OF THE FUTURE). I hope that a future version will appear on THE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES OF THE FUTURE. That would be an invaluble complement to this outstanding series."
3,A signature piece,"The Page Turner is a typically low-key Gallic thriller. The plot progresses slowly - perhaps a little too slowly at times - but builds to a satisfying denouement. However, I couldn't help wonder if Mélanie isn't too emotionally repressed to be able to maintain the desire for revenge for so long. Maybe I'm misreading the character, but ten years is a long time to let such anger fester and she seems too cold to care for that amount of time. It's also somewhat predictable: you can guess what's likely to happen quite early on. Aside from these shortcomings, the performances are excellent and, despite the slow pace, the film always holds the viewer's attention."
3,Revenge is sweet but the script is confused,"An young ambitious pianist is thwarted at a competition by disinterest on the part of a judge and years later gets revenge on everyone that is close to the judge. The plot could have been more amusing, more complicated (many missed opportunities) Still it was enjoyable"
1,Turn the page on this one folks,"Wow. I wish that I had those 81 minutes of my life back. The plot line is weak, but you keep watching because you believe that there simply must be something that is going to happen that is worth watching. The movie is almost as ""thrilling"" as the name suggests: I should've just taken the hint from the imaginative title. Catherine Frot gives a good performance despite the adversity of working with such a lame story."
3,Not a Bloch Classic - Only a Special Interest Book,"I really do love ""Effective Java(TM) Programming Language Guide"" by Joshua Bloch und so I read ""Java Puzzlers"" by him in the expectation to deepen my Java knowledge in a meaningful way. ""Java Puzzlers"" does not meet those expectations. Most of the content is very special. Yes it is Java, yes those are puzzlers, and no I usually do not know the answer. But in almost all cases I certainly do not need to know the answer. Common sense tells you to stay clear from most of the presented stuff. Clearly compiler designers must get those cases right. We average programmers should mostly avoid those areas.Though I did not learn as much useful as I expected, I did learn something. The most interesting new stuff in Java for me was ""Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(hook);"". Also the optical illusions are quite entertaining."
4,Good to know,As the title suggests it is a puzzlers book. Reading this book opens your perspective wrt the language and its implementation. All in all a good (recreational) book.
2,Totally useless,"The ""puzzles"" in the book are cases which no programmer would come across in real life 99.99% of the times. I am sure all of the languages have corner cases like those mentioned in the book. The book should be renamed as ""Cases where you can be fooled by the Java compiler"""
1,"Not puzzles, just silly trivia","This is not a fun puzzle book--it's just a bunch of strange Java programs that produce unexpected output because of, in the authors' opinions, problems with the Java language. There was one puzzle in the entire book the I fealt was fun to work out and provided real-world insight into programming and testing. The vast majority of the code samples are so bad to start out with that it doesn't matter what they produce--anyone that writes them in a production app should be fired.The rest were all weird edge conditions, not fun puzzles to solve. With every example the authors talk about how Java could have been written better so these samples wouldn't produce such unexpected results. Really it's more of an advertisement for .NET than anything else because many of the weirdest samples would produce exceptions in .NET whereas in Java they just do strange things."
2,Don't buy,"If you have never thrown side-arm before, then perhaps this disc is for you. I learned to ""flick"" prior to buying this disc. A friend recommended it to me, so I bought it. Waste of money... I plan on giving it away I hate it so much. So...why does it suck?It sucks because everything you flick it, it fades so sharply that it literally goes a max of 50'. Maybe my style of throw doesn't mesh well with this disc, but I have a few ""go-to"" discs I flick when need be, and they're reliable. I have since talked to others and they agree with me... this disc sucks.So... the friend I mentioned who recommended this to me. I bought it several months after he suggested I do so. I called him and told him the situation. ""Yeah, that disc sucks. I used to like it, but then I learned to really flick"".The only reason it's a 2/5 is because I now understand the trajectory of this disc, and it is now a ""situation"" disc."
4,kmtcpp,"I dont really agree with many of the opinions above. Jaco had worse days than others, and every Jaco fan knows that, but to label this disc as one of his ""bad ones"" is absolutely wrong. If you've heard the ""stuttgart aria"" sessions then you'll know what his worse days were like. Compared to Weather Report days, this album is far from good, but nowhere near his bad days. This is a fine piece of work and one of the best in the N.Y series, with an outstanding 17' Teen Town!!!! A must buy in my opinion."
2,Bootleg Quality Audience Recording,"I suppose there's some historical value to having audience walkman recordings of Jaco Pastorius in his less stellar days. It's sort of similar to a lot of those Charlie Parker audience recordings made by fans and released posthomously. If you want the good stuff it would be better to stick with the major label releases or seek out his supporting work with artists like Joni Mitchell, Pat Metheny and Albert Mangelsdorff. For die-hards only."
3,Watch it with friends!,"This refreshing spoof of the horror genre starts from a clever premise -- an out-of-work soap actor inherits his dead brother's house, and the things that were haunting his brother -- and takes it in surprising directions. Fun characters -- especially the neighbors that are only slightly crazier than real-life neighbors -- and a dead-on send-up of Hollywood's ghouls. Low-budget indie manages to do some clever effects on no money (a ""making-of"" docu shows how). I've seen it twice with different groups of friends, and laughed out loud both times."
4,Handy!,"This little step stool is handy, versitile and sturdy. My kids love it. We bought it for our motor home, but I may have to get another one, as it hasn't made it out of the house yet!"
5,A Must Have!,"My MIL had similar stools in her home and they always seemed liked such a useful tool. I've tried other stools and they just paled in comparison. These stools are great and my kids can easily move them around as they need them. They're lightweight and durable, and they fold up to a slim, compact size. Love the color choices, they work well as seats at my kids outdoor craft table, and they look great too! A must have around the house."
4,EZ Foldz Step Stool,"Another quality product from Amazon. Product was just as described and arrived quickly. It also has a ""load capacity"" that will satisfy many of us big'ens."
4,bjane[NQ],"Purchased this step stool for my grandson. He loves it. He is 4 years old and climbs on anything and everything to reach things. It is very sturdy and I can fold it for easy storage and takes up less room than the conventional step stool. This stool relieves some anxiety about him falling since he will have a sturdy stool to stand on. If it comes in the color black, I will be purchasing another one."
5,Just Right!,"My MIL had similar stools in her home and they always seemed liked such a useful tool. I've tried other stools and they just paled in comparison. These stools are great and my kids can easily move them around as they need them. They're lightweight and durable, and they fold up to a slim, compact size. Love the color choices, they work well as seats at my kids outdoor craft table, and they look great too! A must have around the house."
5,"folding step stool, plastic","One-step stool: This is a great step stool that folds for easy storage. Easy to open up, it sure does the job- stable, sturdy, and strong. I use one in my classroom for the children, and another at home for reaching into high storage. Great functioning design!"
5,It's perfect for our kitchen,I purchased this stool to store in the kitchen for when I can't reach high cabinets or when I need to get into the lowest cabinets and don't want to crouch or sit on the floor. It's very sturdy and it's easy to tuck away along side of the refrigerator. I think it's very a good deal for the money.
4,"Solid & Sturdy, but a bit narrow","I'm 6' tall and wear a size 11 shoe. My 2 clown feet just barely fit on here side by side and lengthwise. That said, I've used it effectively to get things from high places and to change light bulbs. It holds my weight just fine, and folds away for convenient storage.Would be great if it were slightly larger, but then it might not be as portable or easy to store."
4,"Nice step stool, but not visually attractive","What I love about this step stool is that it folds flat into a very small space, which makes it quite easy to move. I use it to sit on while scooping kitty litter; it's just the right height and feels very sturdy. My only complaints: it's almost impossible to get the LARGE manufacturers sticker off it, so it's not very attractive. And mine arrived in white, when I'd ordered yellow. Still, it's functional."
4,"Great, sturdy, and perfect size!","Ordered to use in our bedroom and the reason for 4 stars is that the beige has more of a yellow undertone than the taupe we were hoping for. Other than this, it is a great stool - folds flat and is a perfect size - sturdy to use. Great product so far!"
5,Great Folding Step Stool,"I bought this stool while visiting grandkids. I'm the only shorty who couldn't get into the van & son-in-law always had to lug down a stool from upstairs. I figured this folding stool they could leave in the van under a seat. It worked great and next time I'm up there it'll be right where I need it. Also, I'm a chubby little grandma and it was Very sturdy to stand on!"
4,Impression of B&R Plastic EZ Fold Step Stool,"I really have not had a chance to use the step stool yet. I think it would be very helpful for seniors, especially for itsconvenience and room-saving space."
5,Great little stool!,"What a handy-dandy little stool. If you need a small stepping stool to get to those hard-to-reach places, then you will love this one. Will hold up to 300lbs. Got it for my son to take to his apartment at college. Very sturdy, and it folds up for easy storage. There are three different sizes, if you are looking for one that is a bit taller."
5,Uber Stuhl!,Its strong (holds up to 300 lbs of American excess). Its light. It folds flat. Stores anywhere. Your choice of colors...we have green for the motorhome and black for the house...its amazing and wont rust!
4,Very nice,I purchased this for my toddler and love it! It is easy to use and very sturdy. She has no problem carrying it or setting it up.
3,Sturdy,"This unique little stool is very sturdy, easy to store, and is compact enough to take with you anywhere. We take it camping, my wife uses it at work to reposition herself at her desk so she is not always sitting in the same position. The price is right and it makes a great gift."
3,average stool,i love this stool and it is the best stools around there. good quality quite sturdy and light weight. recommended
2,B&R plastics review,I got this package in a very bad shape. The top surface is not smooth and the finish is rough. Over all I not happy the way it is shipped out to me and the products look and feel.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETK5ES/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,Sturdy stool,My toddler uses a step stool all the time to wash her hands and reach things (things she probably shouldn't) :). Our original one cracked and broke. This replacement seems much sturdier and is easy to fold up. I feel much more comfortable knowing that she is not going to fall through the center.
1,Complete failure of product.,"I bought this to use to help reach into the engine bay of my lifted Jeeps. I weight 270 lbs, so naturally I was looking at something that was rated at 300+ pounds. It started coming apart at one of the corner feet and eventually failed completely leaving me balanced on the fender of my Jeep.He is how it looks now.[...]Product Description: EZ Foldz Step Stool - Blue - Features convenient carrying handle skid resistant top, stable design and plastic construction. Great for bathrooms, bedrooms and every other room in the house. Folds from a 9 inch high step stool with a 300 pound weight capacity to an easy-to-store 2 inch width."
5,"Easy to Fold, Great for Kids","We just received this stool, and so far it looks like a winner. It's very compact folded up, and easy to fold for an adult. For kids it's a bit harder, but I prefer it that way. It's strong enough for my 180+ lbs, and does what it's supposed to. Overall great product!"
1,DANGEROUS FOR FINGERS,"I purchased the 12"" step stall. Was a little stiff to open and close. Upon closing, it snapped shut onto my finger. I have yet to find out if I will lose my fingernail.."
2,Not so heavy duty,"With 29"" it's the tallest step stool I could find on Amazon, but it's rather flimsy and I don't think that it will hold anyone over 160 lbs. It also tends to fold up itself, which makes it borderline dangerous to have around small children. Not impressed."
5,Perfect Stools...,We bought these stools so that my 3 year old could reach the sink to wash her hands on her own. These have worked better than expected. They are sturdy - they have no trouble hold myself or my husband when we use them. I would recommend these to anyone and would purchase again.
2,Great if it still existed,I started an old truck project using this paint for it's availability at most retailers. Well shortly after I started painting the truck Rusto chose to discontinue this color (olive green) and now I'm stuck scouring the internet for any last bit of inventory and paying 40% more than it was in the store. That's what I get for assuming Rustoleum can be depended upon to back their products. BOO!
1,THE COLOR IS NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The color ""Heritage Red"" isn't a deep dark red as advertised.When dry, it also doesn't even resemble the color on the lid or comeclose to matching its' description. The color is in facta medium red-fuchsia-pink, similar to 1940's lipstick colors,and one of our assistants called it a ""Sort Of Navaho Red"".The color is saturated with purple, and when dry, it isn't dark or deep.Of course, if you're red-green color blind, it doesn't matter,but we're not, and it does."
1,horrible on large flat surfaces,this is not my first time spray painting it is near impossible to get an even coat with these satin enamel paints. if you look at a large flat surface your guaranteed to see waffle or variations in the reflection. It's incredibly annoying and even more so considering the cost. I found it for half as much as amazon wanted but i'd not pay two bits for it if i could find a similar product near me.
4,Broad intro to problems in education,"Plumbers are just as important as our philosophers--that's the message of this book. If we don't respect both--neither our theories nor our pipes will hold any water. Gardner does not oversimplify education and say that every student should go to college: he only demands that you choose your own path and go at it full tilt. Excellence is the only thing that Gardner demands. This book is a call for Americans to be great: Americans love to be great, Gardner argues. They just need the leadership to inspire them."
2,"cute idea, not workable for a toddler","cute idea, only four notes, so ""tunes"" are very limited. Children have a hard time getting the toy to play notes because to get sound to come out you have to squeeze pretty hard, quickly, which is impossible for a small child. Save your money and buy something else."
4,Mostly satisfied,"I bought this for my special needs daughter and she enjoys the colors, scent and the noise the legs make when squeezing them. I was wondering if the red rear leg was defective though because it barely squeeks when she squeezes it? I can get it to work better because I have bigger hands and can squeeze it harder. Either way it's making her current hospital stay a little better since this toy distracts her during play."
4,Excellent Toy,Love this puppy!!! The vanilla smell is amazing. I love to play with the puppy since my hands smell good for a long time after.
2,Cute but Uninteresting,"None of my three babies (all boys) have liked this toy very much. I like it much more than they do! When I try to engage them with this toy, they look mildly amused, as if I were ringing the doorbell for them. ""Yawn,"" they seem to be saying. ""It's legs squeek. Huh."" I'm giving it 2 stars because for the pleasure it brings me as a decoration.Pros:* Cute* It smells like vanillaCons:* Does NOT impress babies* Sort of spendy for what basically turns out to be decorative"
3,An Okay Thriller,I read this book for a book club. We are living in the Low Country and and the participants spent most of the time discussing how true it was to the location and debating which islands really were discussed. My opinion was the story moved along well and it was fun to read. I had a problem relating to any of the characters. Some of the plot turns were not believable even in a thriller. One reviewer compares Larkin to Childs Reacher. I find Reacher a more compelling character. Brad Coleman who I thought had the most potential was never really developed. Lastly there were too many lose ends at the conclusion. All in all it was okay but not great.
2,Very Dated Thriller,"This book is a very dated thriller set off the Carolina coast. Though published in 2003, and not highly dated in other respects - the lack of cell phones is the first thing I noticed that seemed ""off"" - and then the lack of computers, on-line research, etc. Was this book written years ago, found in a box, and published, or is the author a complete Luddite? Government conspiracies, drug traffic, ex-cons, female in a guy job - and the female characters are almost blow-up dummies and actually ""do"" very little except when they interact in bed - it's definitely a boy book. The setting could have been lush and sensual but instead was only a pen and pencil drawing, with a few strolls down the beach. The character motivations were unusual, and the alternating smoking/jogging of the protagonist was just ... goofy? All in all - this book did not work for me.It's readable. But sure doesn't even come close to Pat Conroy or Anne Rivers Siddons or even Dorthea Benton Frank."
4,A must read in the world of southern fiction!,"The outstanding setting of the south carolina coastal region, a.k.a. the lowcountry, is surpassed by the well developed characters and politics that form the basis for this story. Carl Smith weaves a credible tale of corruption interspersing human vices and virutes ... greed, lust, infidelity, conceit, bigotry, humility, bravery, and honesty. Although the author brings the story to a satisfying conclusion, he leaves a several hooks for other Sam Larkin adventures. I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy great southern fiction."
3,More about the Enrights...,"If you are reading Chesapeake Diaries, you will want to read this book and the other two about the early Enrights as well -Devlin's LightandMoon Dance.Hometown Girl: The Chesapeake Diariesis much richer for having read these 3.This is a solid and well written romantic suspense with good secondary characters, continuity from book to book (although this would be fine as a standalone), and a landscape you feel you could just walk out into - all Mariah Stewart trademarks, amazing to find so complete in these early books.Enjoy!"
3,very nice romance with great detail,"This romance was a great little read, with believable characters and an interesting setting. Every so often, a romance novelist tries to reference Formula One racing. Ms. Stewart actually gets her details right, a true rarity!"
2,Borrow from a library if you must...,"Settings: Modern TimesTruth be told, I skipped half the beginning of the book and got to the part where Ben and Zoey get together. They don't even meet until the middle of the book which says to me... BORING. The amusing part is her ""cooking"" show which is mentioned a very few times, but one scene is very amusing."
5,great series,Mariah Stewart is one of my favorite authors. She takes you along on as part of her cast. Wou ld tell others about this series
4,Enjoyable Book,"""Wonderful You"" was fast-paced and most enjoyable. I'm a fan of Mariah Stewart anyway.The characters were likeable as well as entertaining."
5,Lovely,Very lovely and sturdy. While I'm not using them for their intended use I'm certain they would hold up well and be a beautiful addition to any drawer/door. They're exactly what I'm looking for in antique accessories (knob-wise) and can't wait to use them for my project.
4,Nice toy for baby,We own this and it entertains my baby for a few minutes. She is very mobile right now (11 months old) and so she doesn't like to sit in one place for long. We mainly use it in the car to keep her quiet.
2,Not that interesting,"Although the bug is cute, my daughter really wasn't into it. She started out with the Eric Carle ladybug that is similar overall, but she preferred the ladybug to the bug. My daughter from 1 month now to 9 months, just chucks this toy aside in preference for more interesting toys."
5,Great travel toy,"We drove from Missouri to Alaska and 4-month old never got tired of it, now she is 7 months old and we are here in Alaska it is still one of her favorite toys."
3,Baby tried to eat the triangle,"My 2 1/2 month old loves all these toys, but recently on this one we caught him with the triangle shoved in his mouth and he couldnt get it out. I reccommend watching your kids with this one!"
3,meh,"They're Anchovies. They're not as good as crown prince. I took a gamble and picked these with a lower price, but should have forked over the extra ten bucks for quality. The oil is ""off"" as are the anchovies themselves. After a few seconds in your mouth they develop the right anchovy taste, but not until then... They might be okay if used in a recipe, but won't stand up for themselves on their own."
2,Anchovie juice?,"I bought a 25 pack of these a couple months ago. So far, two of the cans contained not anchovies but a mix of olive oil and anchovie-like color and taste: were the anchovies dissolved?"
1,Salt and Mush,"These anchovies were a horrible mush of salt, oil and some sort of half-dissolved fish. Absolutely unacceptable for a Caesar salad.I had to run back to the store for a different brand."
4,Looks Good,This is a nice looking table. It appears to be well made. It was easy to put together and looks great in my rec room.
5,nice retro table,"Nice little table. Ha it for almost 2 years, it is holding up well. Looks like picture."
2,Recd. on time but with minor damage,Recd. on time but with minor damage. Children were excited on receiving the table and started assembling when the damage was found. Dilemma to spend the amount on return package when the damage is minor
1,Shouldn't this be titled Rochelle Rochelle?,"I can't say how disappointed I was with this book. If you want the drama of the early Franciscan Movement get David Burr's really excellent non-fiction work on the Spirituals it even has a better ""plot"". The plot of this book is not in fact the Franciscan conspiracy of the body of Francis but the sexual awakening of a young girl in Assisi. It was one of the most pathetic pieces of literature I have read. Especially since I was hoping to really get into the political machinations of the Church, the Empire, and the conventual and spiritual Franciscans, which are in fact minor sidelights to the ""high drama"" of some girl's pubic longings..."
3,"historic performance, tasteless audio quality","This is for serious fans of Jaco only. The audio is so bad, and even the mixes are off. Any songs with vocals are barely audible. Aside from that, Jaco, Hiram, and Woody (Kenwood Dennard), give a great performance. The the scheme of things, you get a sense with all the other Live in NYC set that every night was so very different. S O N N Y B O O P R O D U C T I O NS"
5,Rotary's huge challenge nearly complete!,Very good and illustrates the challenges for those who are out in the field doing the hard yards to get the final vaccinations done.
3,book lightwedge,I received the book lightwedge but have not used it as of yet so I cannot give a rating
3,Good product,"Lights up well but would be better if it could be dimmed like the larger version. Not being rechargeable like the larger version is also a downside. All in all though, it works just fine."
3,"better than most, but...","Lighting is not even, len came scratched (and seems to scratch very easily- lens is very scratched after use) and it didn't come with even a very basic protective cover. On a positive note, I really like the fiber optic idea and the bright lighting it provides."
3,A copy of another,"Though I thought this book was a good read, it was almost a total copy of another Paul Zindel book: the Pigman. In both, there are two teens befriending a lonely elderly person. If the plot differed a little, I would have thought this book great. As it is right now, I'm rather disappointed."
5,Incredible!,"I first read ""A Begonia for Miss Applebaum"" when I was 10 years old. It was the first book that made me laugh and cry (sometimes simultaneously!). I absolutely love the scene where Henry, Zelda, and Miss Applebaum are playing elevator roulette! After reading this book, it sounded like so much fun that a couple of friends and I decided to do it. The imagery is vivid and the portrayal of the character is brutally honest. It's definitely a book that I can relate to on a personal level. I fell in love with Henry from the start with his ""Luke Skywalker good looks"", and Zelda is just terrific! I strongly reccomend that you get a cup of frozen hot chocolate with extra whipped cream from Large Marge and curl up with this book. I do so every year.... A Begonia for Miss Applebaum never gets old, and I discover something new every time I read it. Thank you Paul Zindel!!"
5,Miss Applebaum is the grandmother you've always wished for!,"Yes, ""A Begonia for Miss Applebaum"" is a clone of ""The Pigman."" This time, thankfully, Zindel's teen-age characters do not abuse alcohol. The clever rotation between narrators Henry and Zelda, the book's teen-aged protagonists, increases the book's appeal to both genders of middle school readers. Implausible, bizarre humor is a hallmark of this book. A skeleton is used as a lock box for cash. Henry and Zelda, posing as her grandchildren, admit their former teacher to the hospital. The climax is a completely memorable, absurd (of course) chain of events. Read ""Begonia."" You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll cheer for Henry and Zelda."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the DVD hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on SNL. We had it recorded on VHS many MANY years ago and somehow lost it. But we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where Phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- ""Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man"" ... ""Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie"" ... ""Hair Head!"" I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!!And it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety...They just weren't funny.On a positive note, there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring Phil's audition was quite interesting. But overall, I don't recommend it."
2,Many Great Hartman Skits Missing,"This is good for a few laughs, but overall is a major disappointment. It does not do justice to all the hilarious Phil Hartman moments on SNL. The first half of the tape is decent, but the last few sketches on the video are flat out unfunny. Purchase the video with your expectations low or you will be disappointed."
4,Ping Pong Match!,"Phil Hartman is one of SNL's best, and this DVD does a fair job of capturing his talent, but, like most of these recent SNL DVD releases, it is definitely lacking. If you're a big Hartman fan, you should buy this, but if you're looking for a DVD packed with non-stop laughs, you may be disappointed. This one starts out strong, but dwindles in comedic value by the end. The extras are OK at best, although I did really enjoy the audition extra, which again, if you're a huge Hartman fan, you'll definitely want to see. Overall, there's nothing wrong with this DVD, I had just hoped for more going into it. It would be a definite buy for less than $10."
3,This is missing some funny skits.,"For the most part, this Phil Hartman collection is okay. However, a few skits they should have added are ""As World Turn"" (another Frankenstein skit, with Mel Gibson as his evil twin brother), ""Founding Fathers"" (especially the part where Hartman, as Ben Franklin, pretends to be Marilyn Monroe and sings ""Happy Birthday Mr. President""), and the one where he plays the baby doctor who deliveries are all girls...sort of. Plus, they could've done without the ""Robot Repair"" and ""Sassy"" skits. They were just stupid."
2,disappointment,some of it is good. but they should have filled this up with about 3 hours of material. im very dissapointed in it
3,Not the best clips,"Such a talent and yet not the best clips selected. His best skits were the satires of others (Frank Sinatra, Admiral Stockdale, President Clinton). I'm sure he has many other great clips and can only believe they are being saved for future disks."
2,The Best of Phil Hartman Is A Disappointment,"I love the comedy of Phil Hartman. In fact, He was probally one of the best comedic actors to perform on SNL; a truely gifted performer. So, when I saw this tape with his sketches, I thought it would be uprorious.I found two sketches to be extremely funny and the rest average. The part that I found disappointing is that the funniest sketches ever done by Phil Hartman, for example: The Telly Savalis ""Players Club"", Michael Caine, A visit from the Lord, etc, were cut very, very short. In my opinion,it was not ""The Best Of Phil Hartman""."
2,"Phil Hartman was a superb comedian, but this DVD does not do him justice","I really loved Phil Hartman's work, and I really miss him in that sense. Unfortunately for me and many SNL fans overseas, it is impossible to replay SNL skits outside the US (on the internet), so we have to rely on DVDs like this one.This DVD contains some wonderfully funny skits. However, most of the rest of the material is horribly chopped up - it is much too short (sometimes just a few seconds), taken out of context, and thus very frustrating. It also includes some really crappy skits that don't do justice to the hundreds of great skits they did NOT include...I am truly disappointed that SNL ruined this DVD by terrible editing. They should keep in mind that Hartman is not with us anymore, and let us remember him with a DVD that really shows how talented and supremely funny he was."
4,Good rainy afternoon read,"Like almost every Robyn Carr story, this is well worth your time to enjoy. It is a standalone novel so do not expect a continuing storyline."
3,Fate takes a hand,"This is a story with romance, suspense and intrique which takes place in England around the time of the colonization of America. A young girl, Alicia, with a strange but interesting background strikes a bargain with a stranger to impersonate an heiress. In spite of being pursued by an evil man, her fateful adventure leads to her finding her family about which she knew nothing and assisting the love of her life achieve his dreams.Obviously this is one of the author's first novels as it does not have the sophistication of her later works. However, teenage girls would find this book very enjoyable."
1,garbage in garbage out,I had a chance to look at this book when it was first self published. Luckily I didn't buy it. Doesn't even deserve a review. This is vanity publishing at its worst. I would say no stars but you don't give me that option. This is not a book.
1,Don't do it!,"Forget this whole series of releases-they only taint the image of Jaco that we should preserve-as the best there ever was!I am certain Jaco's spinning around in his grave by the thought of this cd representing his playing skills.The playing on here is drunken,loud,insensitive and generally resorts to being based on a very small bag of tricks of licks.And, oh yes-he's playing a fretted bass for more reasons than one!His chops are so depressingly low that the bright moments on this disc(very few and short to be sure)seem to occur during straight'rhythm section-playing'.Choice of songs is desperate at best...Listen to Bright Size Life,Trilogue-Live,Shadows and Light or his selftitled debut or even the Birthday Concert you want a clear image of who this guy was and why he will be the inspiration of genrations of musicians to come...Stay away from this...no foolin'!"
5,An old favorite,"I first read this book when I was a teenager . . . many moons ago. I am so thrilled to be able to access it again now that it is back in print. I loved it then and I still love it now.The Cheerleader is an honest portrayal of high school life in the 1950's including school dances, first romances, coursework pressures, and sex . . . yes, they had sex in the 1950's! Much of the book's charm is how accurately it captures the essence of the 50's with the sock hops, soda bars, and letterman sweaters. And yet, the themes in this book are enduring . . . friendships, loyalties, first loves, and remaining true to one's self.Many of the book's events are superficial on the surface . . . as so many high school activities tend to be. But underlying high school drama are important lessons to be learned.I look forward to sharing this classic book with my own daughters."
5,What wonderful memories!,"This book hits the nail on the head! For awhile there, I thought I was ready my diary, and then realized that Snowy had gone through many of the things that I did when I was in high school. A great way to remember those by-gone days and the sweet, simple life of a teenage girl. Now, I want to read the sequel, Snowy. Must know if there is life after high school!"
5,An excellent book for anyone coming of age.,"I read this book when I was a teenager in the late 1970's. I read it so many times the book started falling apart! I felt I really got to know Snowy and her friends. I lent the book out, and never got it back. I hope I can find it somewhere. Even thought I am an avid reader, and average about 2 books a week, I stiil feel this is one of the best books I have ever read. This book about growing up in the 50's and running with the popular chaeerleading crowd, stiil will hold appeal for the crowd of today. It has sex, dealing with parents, dealing with problems with friends, and trying to fit in and deal with peer pressure."
5,One of my all-time favorite books,"This is a re-release of the book I loved the most when I was growing up! It is the story of Snowy and the choices she must make about cheerleading, college, boyfriends, girlfriends and her family. Although set in the 50s, the story has a timeless appeal. Many of the challenges the fictional Snowy had to deal with are the same challenges facing today's teenagers. A wonderful, must-read book for anyone 13 and older."
5,A must-read,"This book is a must-read for anyone who has enjoyed Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar."" I encourage the publisher to do anything possible to bring it back into print. It is the story of a girl growing up in a small New England town in the late 1950's, a time and place where roles were defined and futures were assured. The tale of Henrietta (Snowy) Snow translates to teenage girls and women of all ages. I grew up in the 1980's and could identify so completely with Snowy and her friends. I truly love this book and would encourage anyone out there who is listening: It is worth it to search for this out-of-print book in your local library and antique stores. Do it! You won't be sorry!"
3,This book is an interesting way to desribe cheerleaders.,"This wonderful compisition explains the actions of today as well as the snobbish past of what cheerleaders were made of.We are known as preps,snobs,or stuck up girls,&lastly we are described as unsportsmen.Though we work harder and longer than many other sportsmen.It's a hard life,.......but somebody's gotta' do it!!!!"
4,Bundle of joy,"I really like this book, the story was easy to follow. I remained interested and could not help but to want to read more."
1,This Printer is a Disaster,"This printer is very loud. It sounds like a blowdryer and causes the lights in my office to dim (I'm in an old building, but still). I have a USB 2.0 connection, so there should be no problem. It keeps jamming and the help function is completely useless. I used the HP 4000 for many years and was very happy. This printer is a disaster."
1,great machine- diffucult setup,the machine is great but the setup was very diffucult.the machine jet direct card was not reset and Hp no longer offers a jet direct card or software. the fire wire port was broken. had to pay an IT tech 350 to get the printer working.
1,Broken printer,"We received the printer 3 weeks ago, and we're having paper jams. Time for a return. We have purchased 4 or 5 printers from these folks and this is the first time we've had a problem."
1,Big disappointment,"Any relationship between this album and the great ""Lovecraft"" of the early '70s is, at best, coincidental."
5,Fantastic,This is an awesome album....Great sound .....Great songs....Buy it .....It is well worth the money !!
5,That's Easy for you to Say,I like being able to listen to the word being pronounced. The program loaded easily and I did not need to call and get any codes. I loaded it on my laptop with Windows XP and on my desktop with Windows 2000 and it did fine. The only complaint I have is if I want to upgrade to Windows Vista I will have to purchase a new disk.
1,Sounds good----dosn't work in the real world,"This book would cause a relationship fixation and on would loose all ""juice"" Just another good example of a couple of therapists (whom are no longer married by the way) making money with advice that dosn't work."
2,Major mess-up,This Pink Panther does not even fit in with the rest of the series. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it was part of the Pink Panther series.
1,Abhorrent.,"Possibly the most distasteful mainstream Hollywood film ever, this features a clearly-ill David Niven in his final role, in a film that continues a series whose star died a film ago. Imagine the corpses of both Niven and Sellers being squeezed in a giant mangle, and you have the level of revulsion this film engenders. 'Trail' was interesting as a collection of out-takes, although the thought that people paid money to see it in the cinema is mind-boggling; this, on the other hand, is actually offensive. Worse than that, it's neither funny nor interesting, and Blake Edwards' subsequent attempts to resurrect the franchise smell of desperation."
4,Curse of the Pink Panther,Of course Peter Sellers was the best pink panther but I found this movie quite enjoyable. I laughed through out the movie and would watch it again. When Peter Sellers died suddenly this movie gave closure to what happened to Clouseau. It was idiotic at times but isn't that what we come to expect from the Clouseau character?
1,Just one word to Pink panther fans: PATHETIC!!!,Dryfus is falling short of the original and the detective is PATHETIC.Go for the remake with S. Martin soooooo much better then this trash!
1,"""Curse"" Is Right!","No one was clamoring for another ""Pink Panther"" comedy after the death of Peter Sellers, but writer-director Blake Edwards didn't listen. The result was this morbidly unfunny farce, with a mind-boggling cameo by Roger Moore as Inspector Clouseau. A 1983 summer flop, ""Curse of the Pink Panther"" remains deservedly forgotten. Sadly, David Niven's final film (a pity he was unable to reprise Sir Charles Litton for ""The Return of the Pink Panther"")."
3,"Not bad, not good...","I think this film is not bad, but its also not verry good... the previous Pink Panther (iven Trail), had Peter Sellers in it, and HE was one of the reasons that the films were succesfull. Now in this one, because the producers cooldn't find any other usefull material of Sellers (like in Trail), they deside to show a Clouseau-like, Clifton Sleigh (awfully played by Ted Wass), a New York Policeman, whoose been chosen to found ChiefInspector Clouseau. The wrong point to this film, is that the central character of this film, is a anone and uninteresting character. This alone is VERRY BAD POINT of the film There are good things here of course, like the re-teaming of NIVEN-WAGNER-CAPUCINE to their roles from the original PINK PANTHER film. Herbert Lom's outstanding Dreyfus is here. And theres a cute and amusing cameo that you love to see it all over it again Overall, a good movie"
2,Doesn't match up to the other Clouseau films,"This film is mediocre, it doesn't have Peter Sellers! The antics in the film do not make up for the lack of Sellers. There are a few inventive gags, otherwise, unless your a Pink Panther fan, this isn't worth your rental money."
4,ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD,"Those of you who are saying you don't like this movie because Sellers isn't in it have good reason. Sellers is the only true Cluseau. Still, get over it! He's gone! He's not coming back! And if you ask me, Edwards did an extremely good job making a Cluseau comedy with no Sellers. Sure, this new New York detective could never measure up to Sellers, but he did a great job trying. Get this movie. It's actually pretty good."
2,Major Mess-up,I totally hated this film! Sellers did such a great job as Clouseau that nothing seems good enough. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's part of the Pink Panther series.
5,A very funny movie,"The very first time I saw this movie was when it opened at the theater. I saw it with my parents but it really stuck with me and my Mom and we would often, over the years talk about the funnier scenes. We would giggle and laugh till we had tears in our eyes. I love the Pink panther film series with Peter Sellers and this one is just as good. It has a lot of cameo appearances of actors who starred in the previous Sellers films, and it's just really funny. I can't explain it. Just that you're really missing out if you haven't seen this film. I can watch it over and over again, and not grow tired of it. When I discovered it was available for purchase on VHS (used) I bought 2 copies. One for my mom and one for me. From my understanding it is also available on DVD now too, which I've purchased as well. I know, my grammar sucks. : )"
3,Not too bad.,"They went a little overboard on the comedy schtick; but Ilike Ted Wass, sorry it wasn't a better script."
1,Never,"""Never look a gift horse in the mouth."" Either this is existential genius on behalf of the script writer or monstrous cynicism, take your pick. Just remember to fall over while doing it. There is a scene with a blow up doll which is frankly disturbing. An unusually short title sequence by the series standards tells us that someone is embarrassed about stepping on stage."
5,Arkansas Duck Hunter's Almanac,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, who is an avid duck hunter. He has gone to Arkansas for a few duck hunting trips. He has read this book and/or portions of it on many occasions."
4,"Not bad, but pretty dated.","For the price, it's worth picking up. There was some pretty helpful information, particularly the 30/70 rule and some ideas on getting seller financing.The most disappointing part to me was getting excited about the no-qualifying, assumable loans discussed in the first few chapters. The more I read, the more I realized that this was relevant in 1993 (when the book was published). Today, at least in the Chicago suburbs, there are few to zero homes on the market that meet these conditions.That part aside, I learned some pretty useful things that will help me as I move towards buying a home with damaged credit. But it's not a miracle cure or a guaranteed thing."
5,16 Gauge,"If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire. I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge. Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing. It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers."
3,100' phillips spooled speaker wire,"This wire seems robust and produces much better sound than the spaghetti-speaker wire supplied with my HTIB. However, I have marked this product down because the separate wires aren't color coded!! This makes setting up a pain in the proverbial, because you have to mark at frequent intervals along the wire with a permanent marker (well that is what we did) to keep track of which wire is which. Apart from that, seems like a nice product."
1,Not 16 Gauge - More Like 18,I bought much better quality Phillips brand 16 Ga. wire at Wal-Mart for about the same price. This is cheap 18 Ga. wire.
4,"Good wire, bad marking","I bought 5 spools of this wire in 3 separate purchases, so obviously I think it's worth the cost. The wire is braided and both are copper (as noted in other reviews here).My main complaint is that the markings that should show which line is which (the white stripe that should go along one of sheaths) is either very hard to see, or non-existant. 4/5 of mine had a very light white line, the other one had no marking whatsoever.Yeah, seemed weird to me too.A suggestion: If you're running several of these lines alongside one another (in a conduit/wall/raceway etc), look into buying someIDEAL Yellow 77 Plus Wire Pulling Lubricant - Wire pulling lubricant. It makes things go a _whole_ lot smoother. (Pun intended. ;))In all, very happy with this wire."
5,Don't get ripped off by marketing tactics. This is great wire!,"This is decent quality 16 gauge speaker wire. It works fine for all but the highest end systems. It is so sad that companies like Monster Cable have everyone fooled into thinking you need to buy special wire to hook up speakers. 99.999% of people can't tell the difference in sound quality with most speakers, and you probably won't either. use that extra $100 and buy a better receiver or speakers if you have money to burn. That is where the real sound quality is anyway."
3,hard to distinguish the 2 strands,They strip easily and the sound quality is fine. My only gripe is it's very hard to distinguish between the two strands. There's a very faint white line on one of the strands. The surface is very reflective and the it's hard to seperate the white line from a light reflection. The manufacturer should put a black line on one of the strands or use different colored wire or insulation like other manufacturers.
5,Great speaker cable,I use this cable to set up my home theater in the game room of my house and turned out to be of very good quality and the price is pretty cheap
4,Great Quality,"The quality is great. A little difficult to identify + / polarity markings, but for the price it is really worth all the savings."
5,Awesome product!,This speaker wire is excellent..... if you buy this stuff at the store you get soooooooo ripped off... this is an excellent deal!! Buy it here on amazon.. you wont regret it
1,Consistent issue with classic books on Kindle,"I agree with R Tyler, knowing the translation is crucial to choosing which version of a book to download. Poor information about editions and translations is a problem I consistently come across in selecting classic books on Kindle and there are many junk versions of classics out there. Amazon please raise the Kindle level of product information to match that of your paper copies. Without this, the utility of the Kindle will always be diminished."
1,"Get it right, Amazon.","I share the opinion of the two prior reviewers: Amazon needs improve the quality of the information on its electronic books. I have the Waley, Seidensticker, and Tyler translations in paper form. What I want is the Seidensticker and/or Tyler translations on Kindle so I don't have to carry those enormous tomes around. They're both hardcover books of well over a thousand pages each--Tyler is two volumes--and they weigh a ton. From the information given about this ebook Genji I'm not even certain what language it's in, much less which translation. Ebooks, for all their undoubted virtues, are completely useless when the publication information is so bad that consumers can't even tell what they're being asked to buy."
3,Abridged,"This version was not labeled as abridged when I ordered it. Amazon please be more careful about things like that, I didn't really want the cliff's notes version. Hopefully they are cool with exchanging it.Edit: They were indeed cool with exchanging it for the unabridged, even though I was past the usual return period!"
2,Unabridged usually does not mean including only one third of the total book.,I was very dismayed to find so much of the unabridged book was not included. Next time I will look at the number of pages in the book for a clue. A real lesson in buyer beware.
2,Huge face,"I have bought 4 other Harry Potter SII watches. All of them had the perfect size face for a slender lady's wrist. The ""Secrets Beneath Watch"" should be labeled ""men's"" because the diameter is at least 1-1/2 inches. It's definitely not a ""kids"" watch, unless that kid is big-boned. I liked the price (almost $15, including shipping), but it's probably low because it needs a new battery. So disappointing. The battery replacement will cost at least half of what I paid for this watch. I'll definitely think twice before buying from Indy Outlet Center again."
3,"Now Foods Guar Gum 700mg, Capsules, 120-Count",it's ok if you can get it hydrated but it can clog up the lower intestines very badly if you do not drink at least8 ounces water when taking these and then 20 minutes later drink another 8 ounces of water .....it's better to use guar gum as a food additive and not a pill...aka ... suppliment...sorry folks.....it's safer that way ......
1,uuuuuggh,"warning, if you take this, you will become constipated. im talking, one dump a week constipated. and when that dump comes, it feels like and giant coal coming out. i literally sprayed my fanny piece with lidocaine cuz it hurt so bad. but warning, if you do that u dont feel pain and if you dont feel pain you might push too hard. i looked on the bowl and saw a crocodile fetus lookin thing. maybe it was my liver, or just a bunch of brain cells idk."
1,This is misrepresentation,The description says 700mg Capsules 120 count. THS IS IS NOT TRUE! They are in fact 350 mg size capsules.
4,wanted to complete the deadly sins library,like all the other deadly sins books this one is just as goodi also liked the fact frank sinatra played the main character in the movie of the first book..
2,Disappointing,"After reading the first 3 deadly sins, and knowing that the 4th was the last one, I was looking forward to reading it. I was disappointed in that it wasn't as suspenseful and action packed as his other Deadly Sins(Actually #1 and #3 were the best, with #2 being a disappointment). I do not want to reveal the ending, and I am glad that Delaney does figure out the case, but I was disappointed in the way the killer is punished. If I had to rank all 4 books, #1 is a 5 star, #3 is a 4 star, and #2&4 are 2 stars. Start with the first- it is a classic detective/killer book."
3,Could Be Better,"Sanders writes as if he's following a plot outline where he has to fill in the blank spaces. The mystery of who dun it was capably handled, but his characters are made of cardboard, and are trite and dated. You keep reading, hoping the writing will improve...and because you want to find out who the murderer is.And the light conversations between husband and wife just fill in empty spaces without adding anything to the story. Sanders is trying toshow a more tender side of Delaney, but the cute and suggestive banter is just a boring filler.And why does he insist on using everyone's full name so frequently? This irritating technique stops the flow of words.Read this if you don't have anything else to read."
2,"Sad, Bad, and Mad!","I loved the first three Sins, but this latest entry makes one feel quite relieved that he didn't do any more, but at the same time, one wishes he'd get his act together. Very little suspense, and one of those where you know the murderer the first time they appear. Delaney and friends are wonderful characters, but in this outing they didn't do themselves much credit. Basically it's a 20 page story that is dragged out in tedious detail until you hit a very unsatisfying conclusion. He wimped out and did a Poirot ending. Which I hated, needless to say! I wish he would have not written this book at all, or waited until he could have done a better job. If more sins are committed in the future, I will certainly read them, and hope they are better than this trite, deadly dull outing."
3,A relaxed outting from The World's Greatest Bass Player.,"This recording, like all the Live in NYC series, is a poor quality bootleg recording of some very informal live playing. If you know and love Jaco, it is fun to hear him groove along loosley on this disc. But this is not the Jaco that blew away the jazz world and singlehandedly revolutioned electric bass forever. This Jaco had sunk deeper into serious addiction and bipolar depression, was unable to find any legitimate studio or live gigs, and no longer had those mind-blowing chops. To hear that Jaco, listen to all of his solo recordings, collaborations with Joni Mitchell and Pat Metheney and the Weather Report repertoire. Then check this out for some perspective on how the king fell. I love Jaco so I still like this....but it's kinda of sad when you think of what could have been if he had had the will and the access to effective treatment for his problems. The king is dead...long live the king!"
5,Love this,"Jaco was the best bassist in the world, and those that want to learn from him should have ALL these NY recordings in their home!"
2,Jaco at the End,"Jaco Pastorius, bassist and revolutionary, reached lofty heights of greatness and virtuosity before plummeting from that peak. As Pastorius's life went on, he sank further and further into depression and his bipolar disorder, and his playing suffered notably. Alas, this bootleg recording from the waning days of Jaco is an example of just how far one can fall. In a loose, informal setting, Pastorius at at ease, and perhaps too much so. The musicians lack a tightness, and can seem almost sloppy at times. Pastorius is certainly not who he used to be. Yet, even so, there are gems - see this version of ""Alfie,"" which easily ranks up there with the greatest.There's not much more going on here than a tragic character study, but if one were looking to chart the rise and fall of Jaco Pastorius, this is certainly a milestone to keep."
5,Great Looking Fan,"This fan has an early 1900's look that is fantastic. Seems to be cast metal that has an intricate pattern. Very different. Very impressive.Only issue is I cannot find a light kit made for this unusual fan. Otherwise, very happy."
4,Adequate,This is a really good pedal for the price. It does not feel as smooth and is not easy to adjust as higher priced name brand models but has performed well. I haven't had it long but it is holding up well under the abuse I am putting it through.
5,Life Magic,This book has similar feel to books by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. It gives seven ways to change your life for the better. She goes into such detail that you can feel your life changing the moment that you open her book.Love from Both Sides: A True Story of Soul Survival and Sacred Sexuality
1,Does not fit.,Does not fit FRONT axle of MDX. When this was ordered the web page did not indicate if this was front or rear. Hope they fix the description to tell us it is REAR axle.
5,Love 'em!,These tracks connect to all of the GeoTrax rails and my boys just love the trains. I even bought my 2 year old a train this year. The boys just love to play and make new tracks.
1,Wrong product,The picture online showed the product that I wanted to order but when I received the package it was a completely different rail pack than the one I wanted to purchase.
4,UNIQUE EUROPOP,"Demis Roussos was vocalist for the Greek band Aphrodite's Child before he went solo and became a star in the 1970s. His high voice blended well with the bouzouki to create a unique style of his own. This is a good anthology of his romantic ballads and includes hits like Forever and Ever, My Friend The Wind, Goodbye My Love Goodbye, Rain and Tears, Happy To Be On An Island In The Sun and We Shall Dance. He was perhaps a male Nana Mouskouri and if you like romantic big ballads with a touch of the exotic, this album's for you."
5,How Demis brought me love,"I met my lover on the Greek island of Kos in ""Bar Alex"" and he swept me off my feet to ""Save My Love"", we have been tripping the light fantastic to Demis ever since."
1,"Not like ""Full Monty"" - avoid buying from Strangesounds","""Strangesounds"" advertised a two CD special for both the ""Full Monty"" and ""More Monty"" which is supposed to be a ""sequel"". The sequel has no relationship to the original and when I contacted Strangesounds about taking it back, they declined. Thus, Stangesounds claim of ""customer satisfaction as my first and only priority"" is false. Avoid buying from them like the plague."
5,Power Hair for a Powerful Recital,"Mozart's corpus is full of concert-arias and sadly many of them do not get much of an airing nowadays. We are heavily reliant on the recording industry to hear them.This recital was recorded in December 1980 when Kiri was at the height of her powers - and her coiffure bore resemblance to a battlement. There is a creaminess to her timbre that is breathtaking. Better still, her diction and vocal acting are exemplary. She is gracefully accompanied by Fischer and the Wiener Kammerorchester.In terms of the music itself, there is at least one masterpiece here: ""Vado, Ma Dove?"" (K 583). My favourite aria in this recital however is ""Oh, Temerario Arbace ! Per Quel Paterno Amplesso"" (K 79). What is one to make of a mere ten year old who pens such melodies? Unbelieveable.A lovely disc."
2,Disappointment,"I was rather eager to see Gale Harold in a feature length film. I bought the ""Wake"" DVD as soon as I saw it only to be very disappointed by the quality of the DVD. The picture quality is lacking and is shaky throughout the entire film...I got a headache trying to watch it. I really felt that I had not gotten the quality of product for the amount of money I paid."
1,Uh Uh,"Despite previous reviews stating so, Blaze of Glory in this set is NOT remastered. ""Bon Jovi"" and ""New Jersey"" are indeed remastered, but for many, the real draw of this set would be the thought of Blaze of Glory being so, too. There is no value added to this set. The CD's and CD booklets are thrown in directly from the individual packaging with nothing additional save for the pictured box which has CD holders that keep far too firm of a grip. If you need remasters, buy the two remastered albums separately."
2,Odd collection,"As a Bon Jovi fan, this is a disappointing collection. There is nothing new, and the choice of albums is strange. ""Bon Jovi"" and ""New Jersey"" are both remastered, but to my dismay, ""Blaze Of Glory"" is NOT remastered. There are no new liner notes, just the same CD inserts as the original albums. My recommendation is to buy the remastered CDs individually. At least you'll get the jewel cases too."
3,Claro Tonto!,"this is cd is pretty good, however we have seen the evolution of Amarfis thru his follow up cds, keep up the good work."
2,Why...?,"This album thoroughly disappointed me. I had been holding my breath for two years for this record, and when I put it in, I was blown away; but not in a good way. There's not much to say, except that the overall quality of the songs is mediocre at best, and John Douglas (who has always been such a tasteful drummer) somehow manages to heavy-handedly destroy every song that had a possibility of being enjoyable. I hope this album is just a fluke and that Anathema has not left us forever..."
3,HMM... LACK OF INSPIRATION?,"I WON'T SAY MUCH!!Just listen to Hecate Enthroned - The Spell of the Winter Forest (from the album: Slaughter of Innocence) especially to the second half of the song and after this listen to track 6 ""Pulled Under At 2000 Metres A Second"" and tell me what you se..... ;@)"
1,This is the same band that brought us Pentecost?,"This is ridiculous, I can't believe any of you people actually like this. Well, actually I can seeing as how people listen to Marilyn Manson and the like, but to the person who told me to go listen to linkin park and fred durst because I don't like this...That's like telling a Jessica Simpson fan to listen to Ashlee Simpson if he/she doesn't like it. Grow up kid(s) and stop giving these bumbling idiots your money."
2,Did not hold my attention...,"A Kiss From MaddalenaDid not catch my interest...too much detail, not enough substance...Italy is in my heritage, however, it did not keep my interest after awhile... was glad when it was over..."
1,I felt this book was a waste of time.,I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. The characters were not worthy of my interest or time. I was sorry I bought it.
2,A kiss from maddalena,"This book was a deal of the day, and highly rated. I don't understand why it was highly rated. I read it half way, hoping it would improve, then finally gave up"
5,Great book which makes you think.,"Really good book! I wish I knew others who had read it, so that I could discuss! Can't give more details, don't want to spoil anything :)"
3,Well written,"Not what I usually read, but I enjoyed the story. The characters were likeable and interesting. It was a reflection of the times that gives perspective and a reminder that seldom do we know the true and/or complete motives of those around us."
4,4 stars for A Kiss from Maddalena,I liked the small Italian town flavor and the humorus and interesting story of a boy and girl who fell in love through many trials and tribulations. I would recommend it my family and friends.
3,Kind of a disappointment,Although there were parts of the book I enjoyed it was pretty slow through the first half. I got pretty tired of some of the boring details and wanted more of others. The ending was a disappointment. It isn't that I always want a happy ending just that it kind of just quit without really telling much of what happened to the main characters. Were they happy or miserable with their life? I wonder?
4,Enjoyed this novel,"I enjoyed this sweet romance, a Kiss from Maddalena is sad, but love triumphs in the end. I had not read much about how WWII caused havoc in Italy, this was a different perspective."
4,Decent Story,The previous ratings are what encouraged me to read this story. That and the fact that I like books set in this time period. Though it didn't grab me right away I eventually settled into the story line. It is well written and how the author chose to handle the ending was very unique; I just haven't decided if I like it. It felt a little rushed.
5,I have never read a book this fast,"I love to read, but I am a full-time grandmother and I don't often get the time.My girlfriend told me I HAD to read this book and so I ordered it a few weeks ago. I just got it this week and I already finished it! I could NOT put this book down! I have never been lucky enough to travel overseas, and the most Italian thing in my part of the country is the Olive Garden, but this book really made me feel like I was IN Italy. The stories about WWII in the book made the war now seem more real, like I could see how much it can destroy people's lives and at the same time bring them closer together too. I won't give the ending away, but I was crying my eyes out. I wish movies were this good!"
5,Reads like a great symphony!,"Great book! It begins slowly and simply, introducing us to the simple lives of the villagers of Santa Cecilia, and to Vito and Maddalena, all of whom become a part of our own lives. The story builds until you reach the point at which you can't set it down, but you dread having it end.What does that happen with, one in fifty books?"
3,"Interesting, but...","There were times when I experienced being present to the people, places and events described; but, overall I didn't feel engaged in the story and found myself setting it aside ""for another time""."
3,Interesting,"I had not read this author before and it was an easy read, but with a disappointing ending. I will try another book by this author."
5,Couldn't put it down,Very nice drama with enough anticipation to keep me reading. Some elements of tragedy. Enjoyable love story but not all storybook.
3,A Kiss from Maddalena,A moving story that could have been longer and better with just a little more meat. A desperate struggle for life and love left emptying the end.
3,Not Bad,"This is a very cute toy and a great idea. My daughter loves to squeeze the different arms to hear the different notes. There is only one arm that doesn't sound so great because the squeak is very quiet compared to the others. I also wish it wasn't as heavy, but it's still a decent toy."
4,Some notes are flat but baby loves it anyway,"My 2 month old loves this ocotpus. He stares at it and when we play music, he'll laugh and talk. When he's crying on his swing or in his carseat, we'll just plop it on his lap and he'll stop and stare and start talking. Its so cute. It doesn't always work but it works often enough that it is already worth the price. It is a great way to play with your baby.I don't mind the limited music library as I can make up my own tunes and the baby doesn't care if you're off key.The only thing that is bothersome is some of the legs are hard to squeeze to make sounds even for adults which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Hard to squeeze!,"My (very strong and big for her age) 10-month-old wants to make music so badly with her octopus but the legs don't toot so easily--it takes a strong (adult) hand to make music. Does anyone else have that problem or do we just have a dud? She's had this since birth and has just shown an interest in it in the past month or two. It's a big toy for an infant, heavy and not easily dragged around. I wish it responded to her squeezes. Again, she's got a strong grip but gets frustrated with it pretty fast."
2,Octotunes are Off-Key,"We found Octy (he was so cute that we nicknamed him immediately) in a lovely toy shop and bought him for our new grandson, although the toy was not packaged and was a bit heavy. Within days, Octy's notes became off-key: either flat or sharp. Months later, we found a shelf of Octotunes toys, also with no wrapping or packaging, at another toy store, but each of them had at least one sour note! Finally, at a third shop, we exchanged Octy for Octy2. Within a week, all his notes became sour, too! We are quite disappointed, since we usually are pleased with LaMaze toys."
2,"Adorable and well made, but doesn't work so well as intended","I got this toy originally for my firstborn (now 4) and now my second (6 months) has been introduced to it, and neither kid has been too interested. Both kids initially liked the look of it (it's really cute, brightly colored and sturdy, and big for a baby) so they grabbed it, but it's too heavy for a baby to lift and the legs are too fat for tiny hands to squeeze. So after a few pats and pokes my babies grew bored of it and moved on. We also have a smaller octopus (Lamaze Octivity Time)that is light and has lots of different stimuli that's been much more successful, and is one of my daughter's favorites"
3,Hopefully he will play with it when he gets older........,"My 4 month old plays with this toy if I help him. He can not squeeze the ""legs"" to make the tunes. I have to do it for him and its kind of hard for me to do it. I think by the time he is able to do it himself there will be more interesting things for him to do but we will see. I do love Lamaze products for the colors and patterns. I also love love the smell. It smells up my whole living room and it reminds me of hot chocolate. Yum."
3,"Cute toy with fun noises, but hard to baby/toddlers to use","This toy is very cute. My son always loved the noises it makes. The biggest problem with it is that it is almost impossible for a child to squeeze hard enough to make noise. Even at 2 years old, my super strong kid can't really get it to work.For the money, I would pass on this. It has spent most of it's life with us sitting on a shelf, which makes it a very expensive decoration for a kid's room."
4,kinda big toy,not exactly for your little little ones. this is a type of toy for a baby who is ready to explore. but otherwise great fun toy and it smells good too!
2,Not a hit in my house,"This toy is a good idea and it's very cute and smells great when you first purchase it. I gave it to my son at 9 months and, unfortunately, it has never interested him (it's still out in his room and he doesn't look twice at it). I would show this toy to a child before purchasing it since it's not a sure hit with all kids as far as I'm concerned."
1,Scary,"I just received this toy and my baby (6 months old) cries when she sees the octopus. The octopus is quite large almost bigger than her. She isn't afraid of this giant hamtaro plush that we have but she is afraid of this large octopus. The tentacles sort of ""honk"" the tunes and it does not sound all that pleasant.it is so large that it would be difficult for her to even squeeze or grasp this toy if she wasn't scared of it. i would not recommend this to at all."
2,Great Concept - Terrible Design,"If you're going to make a toy for young children, please design it for small hands. This is a great idea. But even I have a hard time squeezing the legs to get the sounds. The higher pitches are easier but the lower notes are nearly impossible for my 2 year old. If we lay it on the ground and she steps on it she can get some sound out of it. The legs are so wide. I can get my hand around it to squeeze it but they're way too big and stiff for a 2 year old to get their hand around to squeeze quickly enough to make the tone.Awful toy and frustrating for little ones (and parents)."
2,"Not the best toy I own, although it is funny looking!","My daughter received this as a gift at Christmas when she was 2 months old. The people who bought it knew that even as an infant, she loved and reacted to music, and they hoped she'd like to make her own one day. She is now 8 months, and this toy just does not interest her. I've played the songs that come on the tag (yes, squeeze the right color and you can play children's songs), helped her squeak the tentacles and encouraged her to wrestle with it, but she just doesn't care. She simply glances at the goofy thing, looks at her other toys and creeps right past the Octotunes to her little piano or her Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Puppy. The only good thing was we got a hilarious picture of her with her big eyes next to this octopus with his big eyes. Definitely NOT the best toy we own!"
2,no big deal,"I really don't see the big deal about this toy, and neither does my 10 month old. He's not the least bit interested in it, and I've shown him that the legs make sounds. He doesn't care. I think it was a waste of money. Oh well."
1,Total bust,"The octopus is for small children. It does have tones in each leg, but it was hard for adults to get the tones to ""play""."
2,octotunes,"this octopus is darling, it really is, my son wont even touch the darn thing though. he's a very active ten month old and we've had this for about two months now, and he could honestly care less about his stuffed animals or doll like toys. he's more intested in balls, blocks, the remote control, mommy's computer or any thing with buttons. i think i find the doll more fun than him. you can play his legs like an instrument but unless your musically inclined this toy may bore your lil one. and the vanilla scent is very strong."
3,Mostly for me.,"I got this as a baby shower gift, because I collect anything octopus related, which has turned into things for my soon to be son (in April).I will say this toy is adorable, brightly colored, and smells AMAZING. (Like the creme filling in Oreos). I squeezed the tentacles and the ""tunes"" are off-key, which a baby/child isn't going to really know, or care about. Mine isn't hard to squeeze, I read the reviews to go try it out, and mine are easily squishable, it's just not the nicest sounds LOL. I still love it and think my son will too, time will tell. Maybe I'll add a review later correcting myself though. ;)"
2,Not a fan of this toy.,"This toy does not ""play music."" You have to really squeeze the legs hard and when you do, they sound like a horn. Even as an adult, I find it hard to make the sound come out of the legs. So it's more like a big stuffed animal. Because it doesn't really do anything else. I'm not a fan for the price."
2,Octotunes,"Colorful and cute, however, Very large octopus legs and very difficult to squeeze for music. I got it for our 3 month old grandson but even our 20 month old grandson could not squeeze the legs. I sent it back."
1,Not worth the low price,"These sheets are made of the cheapest flannel I've ever seen. You can see through it for goodness sake! I've bought flannel sheets from Amazon before and been pleased, but will steer clear of Pike Street products from now on."
2,"Great sheets, but on the small side.","I'll just keep this simple. These sheets are on the small side. If you have a thick mattress they just aren't deep enough. We have a normal thickness mattress plus a foam pad and these will only stay on our bed with the little ""keeper straps"" you can buy. Because these sheets are cotton they may well continue to shrink a little over time. On the plus side, they are cotton and breathe very well. Because they are flannel they are soft and cozy. These sheets aren't super thin like several others you can find cheaply, the only issues with these sheets that I have are with the sizing...just slightly too small. The pillow cases are also on the narrow side but we were able to get our pillows into them."
1,Garbage Do Not Waste Your Money!!!,"I bought Two sets one for myself and one as a gift. Prior to me using mine I washed it and each time the sheets produced so much lint it would completely clog my lint filter. I washed it a total of three times with each wash producing more lint than the last, It was desentigrating in the dryer. And even after the cycle was over there was so much lint left on the sheets it got on to anything it touched. I had to eat the cost of my set because it was no longer in salable condition but the other set I sent back and got a quick refund. Moral: STAY AWAY FROM THESE SHEETS!!!"
3,Economy grade flannel sheets,"I got these flannel sheets from Amazon, believing in the Amazon name. They are not bad quality, and have held up to numerous washes. However, they pill alot and are quite hard after several washes. After, I bought a set of Utica flannel sheets at a local store, in much the same price range, and they have been great; soft hand and excellent color retention.Overall, an economy grade purchase."
2,"Thin, see through",I'm glad that we bought these on such a great deal. As my wife put them in the washer she said that there were see through. After pulling them out of the dryer I discovered that the lint filter was absolutely full. I was amazed that any of the sheets were still in the dryer.Surprisingly they do seem to add some warmth.I wouldn't recommend them at full price (or anywhere near that).
1,"Layer by Layer the ""Flannel"" Decreases","I bought these on deep sale (a clue there) and received them in the mail about a week ago. The fitted sheet looked a little rough, but I decided to try laundering it. No improvement. The pillowcases are great--soft, flannel-like, really good. The top sheet is a bit more rough--not very flannel-like, but still soft enough to sleep with. The fitted sheet is horrible--my first thought when I encountered it was ""sack-cloth."" That opinion has not changed. Do not buy these at regular price--and if you buy on sale, know that they are probably going to be the camping sheets, not the everyday sheets."
3,Flannel Sheets,I love flannel sheets and this product is good. The only issue I have with these sheets is that when you first wash them the lint balls are ridiculous. I had to wash the sheets 10 times before the sheets stopped shedding. I know that sounds bad but once you get through that the sheets are great. I have ordered Pike sheets before and will continue to do so.
1,Not soft at all,"I didn't have high expectations since they were priced so low, and I wasn't disappointed. The sheets are very thin. Even after a few washes, they are still rough. These are not your favorite pair of flannel pajamas."
1,pike flannel sheets,"I bought 5 sets of these in every size. I am very disappointed. They do not live up to Amazons quality of products. They all had a gouey sticker on the back saying made in Indonesia, then when putting on the bed they are so thin you can see through them and they washed up like a rag and shrunk so bad do not fit anymore. A big waste of my money."
2,No fitted sheet depth anywhere,"I asked Amazon, tried to find the manufacturer's info, and received the product. Short of of taking it out of the packaging and trying it there was no way to see if it would fit my bed. I drew the line there and returned it. The manufacturer would do well to list this on the website as I am not the only one I saw asking and mattresses are so thick nowadays."
1,Holes after first wash,"The sheets are sub-par. After one wash, I noticed a tear in the middle of the flat sheet. THe tear is now a 1/4 inch hole. This is a very poor quality sheet set. Please save your money. I wish that I had."
2,Not satisfied,These sheets don't even feel like flannel. Even after three washings with softner they still felt scratchy like sand paper. I thought I was buying soft comfy flannel like the ones I bought here before. If I had known I was buying sand paper I would not have bought these things that ended up in the trash can.
3,Flannel Sheets,"For the price, these sheets are fine for a kids bed. They won't last forever, but seasonally they will be good."
3,Great Feel; Tight Fit,"Pike Street 135-Gram Solid Flannel Queen Sheet Set, RedwoodI ordered the queen set to make our bed extra cozy. They turned out to be very cozy indeed, the flannel was very thick and soft. We washed them before using them. Unfortunately we have a pretty thick Beautyrest matress and a 2 inch memory foam pad that we got at Costco and a very heavy matress cover over all the rest. That made it really hard to get the corners down. We have that problem unless we get sheets that are advertized as fitting very thick matresses, so it is really a typical fit, especially for flannel. Can't give it 5 stars since it fits so tight, though."
2,All flannel is not created equal,"Yeah...I paid $8 for these and I question if they are worth it. You get what you pay for, etc. etc. They are actually translucent. And they feel a lot more test tubey than ""100% cotton."" Contrary to another review, I must admit that they do at least fit the Q size bed, hence the second star. But really, does anyone in the first world really want $8-quality sheets on their bed? Nuff said."
3,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with these sheets. I was really excited to get them because I love flannel sheets, however when these arrived and I put them on the bed, I was disappointed with their feeling. They do not feel like flannel at all. They are not soft and warm and thick. They are somewhat coarse, and thin. I have not washed them yet, so perhaps they will get softer after their first wash, but I was disappointed. Maybe I was just spoiled with my previous flannel sheets."
2,not very soft.,at first i didn't know if these were even flannel. They are VERY thin and not to soft. after one wash they are pilled. wouldn't recommend
4,These are ok for the price,"I just got these and slept on the sheets one night. I noticed they are pilling a little already from just sleeping on them. Not sure what will happen when I wash them. They are kind of thin for flannel and the feel is kind of too smooth or something. I like my other flannel sheets I got at Target, these sheets feel like they have some man made fiber mixed in with the cotton.But for the price, they seem to be ok, just don't think they will last as long as the more expensive ones."
1,I would never buy this brand again,"I bought two sets of Pike Street sheets for Christmas presents and decided to wash them first before giving them to my mother and daughter. I washed them three times as there was soooooooooo much lint. I had handfuls all three times and lint everywhere. What a disappointment. They also are pilled. Haven't even tried to put them on the beds yet as I have been washing them so many times. Well, I don't know if anyone else had this problem but I know I will never order them again!"
2,Great Price but not great quality! Really Thin Flannel,"These sheets were alot thinner than I was expecting. I have bought Flannel Sheets from Amazon before and loved them. But I was disappointed with these, they did NOT wash well either and do not overhang my bed as much as I would like. Definatly need to iron after washing them (although I'm not wasting my time ironing when I won't put them on a bed again) unlike the others I have they are just CHEAPLY MADE but to be honest I didn't expect a whole lot with the PRICE I paid.. Under $10 for KING SET so can't complain too much. Will end up using for rags, dog bed etc. so I suppose I got $10 worth of fabric that can be used for something. Just don't expect these sheets to be good quality."
1,Poor Quality,"I chose these sheets because my daughter's favorite color is red. I ordered 2 other sets at the same price point from other merchandise options for twin sheet sets. This set is by far the least thick, soft and visibly well-made. The package they were in came torn up and there was a small amount of adhesive near the top of the top sheet that won't come off. I would have sent them back, but it wasn't worth the cost of shipping."
3,Comfy but falls apart,I just got these sheets. Washed them. Put them on the bed. Wow are they comfortable. So soft and warm. Sadly they immediately start to fall apart. The pillow case has already torn after ONE night of sleep. Im afraid to fully inspect the rest of it but I can already see that these will tear everywhere.
4,good deal,"the sheets were bought on a whim - but - I will be watching for these again at the price I paid. very comfortable, soft and a great fit for even big mattresses. keep their shape after washing. a really good deal"
2,too much lint,"This is the first time I have used flannel sheets so it's nice to climb into bed and it's warm, but when I get up we are covered in lint, and when they are washed and dried the dryer screen is loaded with lint...not sure how long this will last they have been washed a couple of times..."
1,Should have spent th $50!,"These sheets shed their skin! Do not lean on your bed when you're wearing your black suit - you'll need to go through your entire lint brush. Also, you don't want to wake up with lint all in your hair. Spend the $50 on a set of good flannel sheets. The $6 wasn't worth it."
4,Feels Great!!,These sheets are a great buy. They feel so soft! They stay on the bed and fit great. I should have bought more!!
1,yuck.,"Great price, yes, but I would not purchase again. After one washing these sheets don't fit my bed well, and they are very rough. They feel like a five dollar flannel shirt from the local low-end discount emporium.Spend the extra few bucks and go for 160 gram sheets."
2,Okay sheets,These sheets are kind of thin and are not as soft as my other flannel sheets. I guess they are okay for a guest bed or your up north cottage but I would not buy them again for everyday use...
1,You get what you pay for,"I should have realized that when the price is too good to be true, there is a reason. It's not that these are bad sheets, it's that they are bad FLANNEL sheets. I'm not sure what the '135-Gram' applies to - 454 grams equal one pound, so that's about a third of a pound, and the set of sheets weighs more than that. They'll be OK for regular sheets, but I wanted warm, cozy sheets, and these won't fit that bill. Too bad."
4,nice flannel sheets,"These are nice flannel sheets. They fit well on the mattress, wash nicley. They are not overly plush, but a nice value. They are really fuzzy and still look new after 4-5 washings. My son only wants these on his bed."
4,Flannel Sheet Set,Theses are great sheets and I will purchase more great products likethis at prices and value as great as this.
4,Good for the price,"I bought the queen size sheets and even though I have a very thick mattress, they surprisingly fit. They got softer as they've been washed, which I believe to be natural but they are also quite thin compared to other flannel sheets I have owned. Overall for the price though, I find them to be just fine."
2,ok but could be better,These sheets are ok but the pillow cases were not king size in the king set and the sems were not properly closed I had to resew the sem myself for almost the entire length of the pillow case.
3,You get what you paid for,for 7.99 you get what you paid for. I have a king size pillowtop bed and it is too small (snug). I washed it once I got it and it's thread were coming apart. maybe it was my set. I will not buy again.
5,Flannel Queen Size Sheets,"I love the Amazon Daily Specials. Everything I have purchased using that button has been excellent quality and far exceeds the price of anything I could get locally, even on sale."
1,Low quality,These are the worst sheets I have ever owned!! They shrunk after one wash!!! And they got fabric piles bad. They no longer fit my queen bed. Dont buy these they are not worth it!!.
4,Be-boppin away!,My 15 month old Loves this cd! The songs are so up-beat and the lyrrics are extrememly catchy! It's a great way to entertain the little ones!
5,When is the trilogy going to be reprinted,"I have read ""Twilight Memories"" and I am begging you to reprint the rest, please do not leave me hanging like this...."
5,One of my favourite books.,"I first came across this book some years ago and I'm currently rereading it with great pleasure. A Booker Prize winner (for ""Schindler's List""), Thomas Keneally is one of Australia's finest writers. This non-fiction book takes us with him on his many journeys through the American southwest. His interest in and passion for this part of the world can be found on every page. With an outsider's keen eye, he takes us backwards and forwards in time from the geological formation of the region, the coming of the first Americans, the Spaniards, the Europeans and into the modern era.I loved this book so much that my family and I will visit the southwest ourselves this year. Read it now!"
1,Just bad,"Movie lacked any real funny moments. The idea was a bit cool though. If this idea of the old scout master dieing in the woods and his son taking over was done in a serious note could be great. But a movie with a bunch of kids and couple guys just swearing the whole time at nothing, quite terrible."
2,"Product was fine, movie was a stinker","The DVD was fine and arrived new. No problems there, but the movie itself is a dud. Great cast and I was expecting a lot more. Going in the 'give away' bin."
1,Pointless,Just a plain bad movie. The story has no direction. The humor is not good. Everything about it is just horrible. Do not waste your money.
3,Pretty Effin Good,"This movie is a pretty standard modern comedy with its moments. Rob Riggle is perfect and Patrice O'neal was on point, rest his soul. JVille was actually comedic relief still up to his Jackass days, yet with the structure of modern stunt work. Patton Oswlalt headlined as the common sense factor but scooped the elusive naked biker chick, so in all he was pretty badass. This movie has all the quirks and machismo that a guy flick should have. Grade: B."
5,Fisher Price - Little People: Songs and Games for the Road,"This tape is excellent. The songs are alot of fun and upbeat, the children love them. I was a preschool teacher and we sang all these songs all the time...My grandson if 1 yr. old and he enjoys all songs.I also recommend the Christmas tape and The Sing along Favorites. I enjoy them all."
5,Great fun for kids!,"When my kids start getting restless in the car (usually stuck in traffic or on a long drive), I just pop in this CD, and instantly have happy campers. My children *LOVE* the high-energy songs and tongue-twisters, and the moment they hear the opening song beginning, they sing along and clap their hands to the music. And they also try to remember the lyrics, so it occupies and strengthens their minds as well. Sometimes I even join in the fun! I heartily recommend this CD to anyone who likes to have fun with their kids anywhere, anytime."
1,"Cute, but disappointing","Because of the size of the opening, it is awkward if not difficult to drop the yolk and white into the back of the ceramic chick.Also, in terms of actually separating the white from the yolk, it is generally not effective. Half of the time, the yolk is partially sucked out with the white. Now the yolk is broken up and mixed into the white and one must start over with a new egg.Cute idea though."
5,I like it!,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews. I was given this egg separator a couple of years ago as a gift and I like it just fine. I do agree that the hole on the back that you crack the egg into is kind of awkward, but if they'd made the hole any higher up, the egg would spill out when you tip it. I've never had any problem working with it and it's always separated my eggs without a problem. Also it's cute!"
1,"Cute, but sucky.","The other reviewer has this exactly right. It's cute, but does a terrible job of separating. Once you get the technique down, you can do it most of the time without breaking the yolk, but it is SLOW. Some eggs may take as long as five minutes to separate."
5,excellent!,"i just love pearls! and dahlia jewels takes the most beautiful pearls in beautiful and elegant designs. everyone always asks me where i get my pearls, and i tell them at dahlia jewels!"
4,continues on with the drive of thier previous 2 albums,"if the first 2 albums were any idea of how good this one would be--buying it owuld be a no brainer--the melodies mixed with excelent vocals make this an album to share with all your friends--since no one knows this band, let's get the word out"
4,Good Series,"I have been a big fan of Japanese animation for a long time, but this was always one of my favorites. I'm glad I got a chance to get the series before it was gone. I have missed a few in the past thinking ""ill wait for it to go down in price"" Bad idea. My advice, if you like it, buy it before it gets away.The voice acting is good in this series, the only thing I wish they did was subtitle the names of locations when they are splashed on the screen, other than that it was great.And one last thingFINAL FUSION Complete!!!!!!"
3,Lacks in depth story,"This anime gives the felling of watching a cartoon. To better explain there are no adult situations or major story line to follow. Each episode is basically the same thing, using the same transforming sequence scene in each episode. The episodes are as follows. 1) person is turned into a Zonder 2)Guy's big robot plus two smaller robots use tools that look like a screw driver, pencil, and a eraser to defeat the Zonder 3)The kid transforms the Zonder back into a human. Each episode is not tied to the one before it. GaoGaiGar does offer heart warming friendship in extreme situations and fairly good dubbing. The ending of each episode provides the question of what will happen next. Basically this anime is for someone that is fairly young and is placed in what i call the cookie cutter section or styling for anime."
2,"not the best collection, but acceptable","Not the greatest collection. Still, the price is great for what you do get. A large sampling of great poems from many time periods."
4,As good as a collection of Love Poems gets,"I got this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend a few years ago. There are some excellent poems, especially Browning and Shakespeare.I did find out by reading this poetry collection that I'm just not a big fan of love poetry. All the best is here, but except for four or five poems, it just doesn't move me.If you are a lover of romantic poetry however, you can scarcely go wrong with this collection. It contains all the classics and many more. The price is just right too, obviously not published by someone out to make money, but by someone who wanted to share the poetry."
4,Many of the best love poems omitted,"This anthology has some of the greatest love poems in it. But it also fails to include many great love poems, including those of Wallace Stevens. It too should have stated that it confines itself to English Language poems only. It too has poems of the greatest quality ( the selections of Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth) and poems of much lesser value. I too believe that within many individual authors it could have had poems of higher quality."
4,Nice Collection,"I ordered this (as a start to Christmas shopping) for my dad. I recieved it today, in excellent condition.I flipped through the book, it's rather short, but then again poems aren't very long to begin with (some exceptions, of course). It seems they focus more on traditional love poetry mostly from England. There are many famous love poems included in this collection.My dad was looking for a book on love poems, and I saw this and figured it would be a nice book to have for that. It's a very nice book for the price and many famous poems from some of the greats: the Brownings, Percy Shelley, Robert Burns, Emily Bronte, Poe, Shakespeare and many more!"
4,"Another winner from the Institute for Historical Review and it's Co., Legion for the Survival of Freedom","Pick Up On It while it's still available.The IHR, except for selected flyers andNewsletters is only published online now!"
5,Highly Recommend,I do a lot of scale development in my research as well as review journal manuscripts in psychometrics. This book is very useful and is a staple in my work.
5,Baby Taming,"Absolutely the best, simple, and most humorous guide to baby rearing I've ever seen. I used it with my child and recommend it enthusiastically to any new parents."
4,"sturdy, secure but arrived dented","the case is sturdy, highly protective and secure (with three locks/locking options). but it arrived with a slight dent. the dent did not compromise the functionality of the case but is a flaw that should not be found on a brand new item."
5,AWESOME!,"I recently purchased this filter about 2 weeks ago and it works GREAT! I previously had a power filter from AquaClear, and I am using a 20gal tall tank for my turtles and it was noisy and didn't do the job but when I bought this in tank filter, my tank is crystal clear. I recommend this product to everyone, it really does the job. Last week I just upgraded to a 20gal long tank for about $33 and I used my other 20gal tall tank for breeding feeder fish for my turtles; my RES and my Map turtle."
2,Needs work...,"When i first got my turtle,this is the tank filter i got. It was okay at first because i didn't know much about taking care of a tank, but now i know better. There is a lot of cleaning, making sure all the waste is gone. But it gets really annoying when your tank filter is full of the waste. There's many places you can't even get to, you just have to trust that you got all of it. If you own any animal, you know you probably didn't get it all but it's best you get most of it. The tank i have right now is way better. You really only have to rinse it and change the filter every month. It lasts a lot longer than this one. I had to change the filter every week and even than it didn't seem to help. I would say buy a Zoo Med producted first, they seemed to be more techical and better filters."
3,Not as quiet as they claim,"These pumps appear to work, but they make more noise than my hang-on-back filters.I put two of these in two side-by-side 20 gallon aquariums. They are in my bedroom and at night, as well as day, I can hear the water gurgling. I fixed the problem by bending the filter cartridge back a little to overlap the water hole. That silenced them enough to live with. They still hum fairly loudly. I may sell one and get another Top-Fin 30 and keep the other as an emergency backup. I won't be buying any more."
4,"Whisper In-Tank Filter 40I--Great but some minor problems, now solved easily.","Purchased 2 units--One each for 30gal. & 20gal. tank. No problem getting oversized units. Only problem occurs when mounting in tank where water level is at top. Used a small piece of wood to mount properly; however, as filter accumulates material, the filter starts to splatter some water. The 40i should have been designed with a cover to prevent this. I have simply placed a small refrigerator storage container over the filter top, and this seems to be the effective solution. Note that the filter is extremely quiet. I am continuing the use of air pumps in those aquaria."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this filter to go into a turtle tank. The design suggested that it would be suitable for this application. I have also had good experiences with other Whisper filters I've owned in the past. I have not been putting up with it for about 1.5-2 months. I loath this filther. First, the suctions cups don't stay on so the filter continuously falls into the tank. There should also be at least 4 suction cups. Having 2 placed in the center of the filter means it rocks back and forth and is not secure. Second, the bracket you can use in place of the top suction cup doesn't fit on the lip of my tank. So again, it keeps falling into the tank. If I can't return it because it's been used I may actually just throw it away. If you're looking for a good internal filter check out Ovation or Fluval. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not happy with this Video,Thought this might be a little more scientific/health oriented. Wish I could have read a review before purchasing it. Real basic and not much information. Program is like a typical talk show with guests etc. I wouldn't waste my time and money on this!!!!
1,"Amazon says ""1998,"" but this is a 1930 recording","I was very disappointed. Nothing prepared me for the fact that these recordings were made 70 years ago in 1930. The information on Amazon's Web Page says, ""Arbiter ... 1998."" The outside of the CD box, however, tells one immediately when the music was recorded.The quality of the recordings made then is simply painful to listen to by today's standards."
4,Review of Memoirs of Sukey Harley,"I read this book firstly because she is a 4th great grandmother. I found her words and descriptions of her conversion well spoken, unusual when you consider she lived from 1783 to 1853 and had no education. Her stories are well thought out and easy for anyone at any age to understand. You do not need to be religious or have a religious background to moved by her stories.This book should be read by anyone of any age - not just the recommended reading age of 9-12"
1,"Cheap, leaked like a seive after 3 weeks.","Just completed a 2.5 month, 12,000 mile trip around the US. The pressure regulator arrived with the gauge needle stuck behind the pin, that part fixed easily, just popped off the cover and moved the needle. After about 3 weeks of use, with never having had external pressure over the mid green level, this thing started leaking like crazy. This wasn't 3 weeks of continuous use, as we would spend about 5 days dry camping, then 1-2 days in a commercial campground to clean tanks and recharge systems. So in reality it was in use maybe 5 days. By week 4 it was totally worthless. Don't waste your money.Camco stuff sometimes works, sometimes is crap."
4,This product allows you see what you are at for water pressure,"This product allows you see what you are at for water pressure.I wish I had bought this regulator with the gauge earlier in the season. The problem with just the pain regulator is you have to guess where you are at.I have lived with the other style for years, this one takes the guess work out of it all. Quick and simple, still some numbers on it would be nice along with the yellow ,green & red."
4,Water Pressure Regulator,I needed a pressure regulator for water to my ice maker and evaporative cooler. This Camco regulator is working out very well for my needs. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with too much water pressure for their appliances and coolers.
1,Defective unit,"This water pressure regulator arrived defective, exhibiting what is known as ""hysteresis."" In normal language, it makes a loud screeching sound when attached between the exterior house faucet (i.e., hose bib) and a hose with a nozzle that is shut off. When the water is running, the gauge is fine, but when the nozzle is shut off and the regulator is required to do its job -- regulate the hose pressure -- it flips out.Hope this helps, Tim"
1,Not good!,Worked for a couple of trips then stopped the water flow completely at 4am on a chilly night (no it did not freeze).
1,This item is not as pictured.,"Picture shows a gauge with pressure readings, the item received has a gauge divided into three sections, ""LOW"", green, and ""HIGH"". Many reviewers have mentioned the same issue. Thankfully amazon has an easy refund system."
1,"Defective, with no warning that it's going to fail","I wanted to reduce the pressure in my water system. This was one of only a few devices I could find that was designed to do this function. Worked fine for a little over one month, then it completely stopped all water flow ... right outside the return window. So it goes into the recycle bin. Total and complete waste of time and money. I deserved this outcome, because other people have written of their similar experience and kindly provided warning which I simply ignored."
2,Same info in other books that are better written,"I had a nano reef tank several years ago. Since I plan to take up the hobby again I'm doing alot of research to avoid the mistakes of the past. I purchased this book among others. My opinion is that the information in this book is covered in other books much more clearly and thoroughly. It seems to me that some of the info in this book is too unnecessarily technical, while other info is glossed over and not well explained. I picked up two good tips, but that was all. I guess I would rather that someone read this book than nothing at all when first entering the world of marine/reef/nano tanks, but it would not be on my top ten list of recommendations."
1,Returned,I ended up returning this book as it was not what I was looking for at all. If you can find it at a library go that route.
3,A GOOD START,"This book is a decent beginners guide. A lot of the opinions in it are a bit outdated, but the facts are dead on. My wife ""had"" to have this book, but everything I needed to know was on the internet."
2,eh,this book was only helpful to me when selecting which fish I would put in my nano reef aquarium. other than that it was a waste of time. way too much unnecessary information.
5,"Product is Very good, Seller is VERY VERY BAD","I have bought this same product from Amazon 3 times before and let me say this Eternity Set is just awesome. It's one of the best EDT and After Shave by CK.One glitch about my most recent order is the 3rd party seller I bought this from as it was not available from Amazon directly. The product box came damaged and the shipping box was fine. When I contacted the seller the seller told me that Product Box being damaged doesnt constitute a damaged item and hence I will have to pay for the shipping incase I want to return it. I told him box is damaged and I cant gift it now. He said it your prerogative and he cant do anything about it. Dont buy from the Seller - ""ThePerfumeSpot"""
1,Bruder Cement truck,"For the price, this truck should be more durable. The first hour the chute extension broke and the hose came off. This was what my grandson wanted, well actually he wanted a Concrete Pumper Truck but they do not seem to make them. He has hundreds of trucks, tractors, cars and trains and is very gently with his toys, so he was dissappointed when the truck parts did not stand up."
3,Cool looking but flemsy as can be,There are not many working large size concrete mixers out there. I found this plastic Bruder model. It is very cool looking but lasted about 2 weeks before one of the smoke stacks broke off and the gears striped out for the concrete drum. for $50 it should have been made of metal.
4,INSTRUCTIONS???,I would have rated this toy higher in educational value if there was an INSTRUCTIONAL SHEET detailing its'operation. (Booklet enclosed w/mixer showed only the various trucks/parts Bruder offers.) DURABILITY.....small black hose broke off immediately.OVERALL......our grandson was thrilled! PLEASE EMAIL INSTRUCTIONS. Thank you.
4,Three Year Old Concrete Truck,"Couldn't find one anywhere. Truck is nice, not as sturdy as I expected. All plastic, no metal. Working mixer is fun for my little boy. We put coins in it and let him pretend to pour concrete. Wish it was available in red, my child's favorite color."
3,Bruder Mack Cement Mixer,A lot of small pieces to break and the kids played w/it for two weeks then parked it in the basement.
4,cool truck,"This was purchased for toddlers, and I am hoping that even though it is made of plastic that it will hold up. Very realistic, the boys love it, is definitely a cool truck."
5,Well worth the money,"We bought this truck for our grandson's 4th birthday. He is a truckaholic and had been asking if he could have a cement truck like those he has seen on the road. As soon as he opened the present on his birhtday he was examining all the features of the truck and making favourable comparisons with the real-life trucks he has seen.He plays with it everyday alongside his other construction vehicles building things of national importance, as well as acting out many creatively imagined accidents!the truck is big, sturdy and durable. I'm envious that there was nothing like this when i was a kid."
1,"Global Warming Hysteria, Patronizing","An extreme one sided presentation of global warming alarmism and crazy energy schemes. Features long time environmental radicals like Lester Brown, Van Jones and Armory Lovins. Takes a patronizing attitude toward featured ""regular guys"" who supposedly benefit from windmills, etc. The regular guys use profanity to make them seem more regular. Makes all kinds of unsubstantiated statements blaming every bad weather event on climate change being here now.Everthing in this movie is pretty much a lie."
3,Post Top,"I was a little confused when I first ordered because it didn't show up on my order tracker the next day. The product was great, came quickly."
4,A very handy guide for decorating and matching colors,"This has been the most helpful book I've discovered for matching colors as I spruce up my house. Flipping through all the color combinations gives me great ideas, then the really cool part about using the tear-out color strips to match my couch, then taking them with me to the store to match to the perfect carpet! No need to cart the whole book with me. I know it will also come in handy next time I go clothes shopping too. His other book, Dewey Color System, about color discovery in your life and understanding yourself through color sounds funs and fascinating - I can't wait to get it too!"
5,Great for Toddlers!,My granddaughter loves Charlie and Lola! They make her laugh and Lola and Lota are so cute!! Great to learn about friendship and siblings.
5,Charlie and Lola at its best,Love the holidays and love the was Charlie and Lola celebrates it. My kids love this cartoon and so do I!
5,Streamlight Battery,Purchased the battery stick for my streamlight from Amazon and was very pleased with the product and the price. thanks Amazon
5,"this book is really, really, absolutely, positively,AMAZING!!!!",i love this book n not just this book the whole series. this book is really good but kinda sad but i like how it doesnt end with a happily ever after because with that it will make these books seem so fake but without the happily ever after endings it makes these books seem so real i mean u can just paint a picture of what u r reading in your head n i love how it increases ur imagination. i think these books are amazing and i love that it doesnt always tell you everythin and it makes u want 2 keep reading more and more. i love how these book involve bobby's friends because it shows that he actualy had a normal life or what seems to us a normal life. these book are really good so read them urselves if u dont believe me and u will love them jsut as much as i do. there is so much more amazing things 2 say about these books but i could just keep goin on forever thats how good they are. I LOVE THESE BOOKS THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!
5,Pendragon is the best book i've ever read!!!!!!!!!!,"Pendragon is totally the bomb!!!!!!!! I f u lioke fantasy or science fiction u will probably love this book. It's my favorite book in the whole world! I think it gets better with the second book. If you're looking for a book to read, any good book, definetely pick up pendragon. you can't not like it!"
5,Love it!,Every Pendragon book is fabulous. This book is really fun and takes you to a great planet. The storyline is just great. You'll love it!
5,Great Book From a GREAT Series!!,"The Lost City of Faar is a wonderful addition to the first book in the Pendragon series! The Lost City of Faar is set on an aqua-planet called Cloral which has amazing water technology. (including ""air globes"" which allow people to breath underwater easily...how cool is that?!!) Bobby is back in action, and has made a new friend who will help him on his quest to save the universe. This book has an amazing plot which is full of twists and surprises that no one could imagine! Again, this series is perfect for those hard-to-please readers and fantasy fans. Exciting and enjoyable at any age, Pendragon will thrill you until the last page. Irresistibly good!"
2,O.K. but it could be better...,"The first book of the series was pretty good, but this one is a little slow. I found myself skipping pages and pages and found out that i had missed basically nothing. But beware. It gets worse throughout the series, so why dont you just guess what happens? its that predictable. it is almost painful."
1,When this arrived it was not the color shown!,"This runs fairly easily, and I mean it snags. It is also not the color as shown, but mid blue and more aqua than shown. Very disappointed. You hate to mark anyone down in this economy, but this was not what was described at all. Sorry!"
5,Flippin Marvellous!!!,"I bought this in Durban after a 3 month volunteering project where I heard nothing but Mafikizolo on the radio and playing from windows etc etc!Unfortunately one of the members was shot in Johannesburg while I was in the country, I only hope that despite the sadness, this is not the end for the band.Just a totally joyful cd!L.x"
3,Hacker's review,"After reading Hacker's book Desesperanto I felt like I knew her with out knowing her. She writes beautifully about her life, friends, where she grew up, her get-away place(Paris), and her strong opinions about politics. Through imagery and word usage she gives the reader the setting, the time, and the emotional state she was in. You can hear the train in New York, see the cafes in Paris, and smell the Lapsang Souchong. The use of French gives you a better sense of what she was trying to capture in this collection and a good explanation of her life in New York and in Paris."
3,Desesperanto: Poems 1999-2002,"Ashley BraswellIf you don't have a lot of time on your hands, or have difficulty getting through poetry, then this book is not for you. This is definitely an advanced read, it's not just a curl up by the fire type book, it's an intense work of art. Her vast knowledge of two different worlds (Paris and America) have been brought together here in this book. She does a great job of relating extraordinary things, to your ordinary person. Hacker is lyrical, and have a magnificent way with words. There are many poems in this book that stand out. She is a very literal writer, it is very evident that her whole heart is put into her work. When you read this, you have a sense of her, what she is about. I enjoyed this book, it is a great way to get your mind jumping, and thinking, and working. If that's what you are looking for, then this is it. If you are looking for an easy read, then stick with nursery rhymes."
4,online hacker review/ mike harrington/ ecu,"Hacker'd Desesperanto seems to be a collection of poems which are heavily inspired by acquaintences, experiences, and societies known by the poet. When the collection begins with an elegy for June Jordan- a former social and political activist- stating, ""June, you should be living the states are bleeding"", the reader is granted clues on Hacker and what might inspire her. Issues such as fast food advertising and urban sprawl are examples of these inspirations Hacker used to write her poems. We also saw in English 182, a social issue which touches base with every american system. That is education failing students and discouraging their adult teacher who just didn't get through. Hacker seems to muse very frequently on topics which are seen daily, but not stopped and thought about"
4,Desesperanto: with hopeful despair,"The pages of Marilyn Hacker's Desesperanto are filled with stunning language and refreshing, original rhythm that convey a sense of realness that any reader can relate to. Hacker shares her personal experiences she has endured with friends and family by taking us on a reminiscent journey full of allusions. Her words, both French and English, give the book depth and creates many layers for the reader to interpret and connect with, both young and old. Desesperanto leaves the reader with the feeling that hope can be obtained through despair."
5,Wonderful Feel Good Movie,We love this movie and plan to watch it many more times. This movie delivers a great message and is very touching. I would say that this movie could be watched and enjoyed any time of year...not just the Christmas season.
2,Got the wrong version,"I thought I was ordering the full-length DVD version of Christmas Oranges, but when I received it, it was the 20 minute version. I was able to return it and get a refund. Then I re-ordered and got the correct version. I am now happy with my second purchase."
2,painfully basic predictable melodrama,"Watched this film on Christmas Eve with the family and was very disappointed. The plot was basic and the story line, completely predictable in the first 10 minutes, took another 90 painful minutes to get to the inevitable punch line. Read Sean Means' review in the Salt Lake Tribune and avoid this waste of money. ."
1,Sadness,"I bought this abbreviated offering with great expectations. After all, I loved ""So There"" and thought it was an extraordinary new departure for Paul Pampinella following the dissolution of the phenomenal Vox One. Wrong! If you are no more than about 17 you will like the ""boom-boom"", the echo chambers and the reverberation units, lyrics that are pinched, squealed and not sung, harmonies that are pedestrian and slurred. Five O'clock Shadow can do much better and already has. Please continue the soft rock in the style and quality of ""So There"". ""Misfits"" is a real must miss!"
4,Great Entertainment,High I was never really interested in any A Capella music until Five O'Clock shadow came to my school and sang for a live concert. I was amazed at their ability to make music just by themselves.
4,Perfect fit,Skids were shipped quickly and fit perfectly. They are a little expensive for what the are but they are necessary to the function of the plow.
4,This is NOT a Punk Band,"A previous reviewer claims that this album is a Great Punk Album and is a must own for Punk fans. Although LIVE is a very good album with a classic version of WPOD, there is absolutely no way The Tubes can be considered a Punk Band. This band is the epitome of a fringe band that saw a movement (i.e. Punk) that it could satirize and gain some noteriety. I saw the Tubes in 1982 in Grand Rapids, MI, and the show was fantastic. The tunes are catchy, with a tounge-in-cheek look at sex, drugs, and more sex. If you want catchy rock riffs, buy this album. BUT DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET A SEMINAL PUNK ROCK RECORDING."
4,"Great, Wild, Really Live!","This live from London, England album was the Tubes attempt to cash in on the punk craze of the late 70's. And they do a pretty good job of it. The sound is very good for a live album. Besides live versions of such popular songs as ""What do You Want from Life"" where a girl from the audience is given a choice of interesting prizes, there is the original ""I Was a Punk, Before You Were a Punk"" and the R'n'R standard ""I Saw Her Standing There""."
3,The next best thing to being there (Again!),"This CD represents the Tubes live shows from the NOW tour. From the beginning notes of Overture which features the vocals and wit of Bill ""Sputnik"" Spooner, through the show closing White Punks on Dope, this is classic Tubes. The only thing missing is the fabulous stage show which accompanied this tour. Fee Waybill is in control as always and the synth of Michael Cotten and drums of Prarie Prince shine through. A true snapshot from a time when the Tubes performed theatrical rock best."
1,Decepcionante otra vez,"Ruben Rada supo ser un personaje respetado en el ambiente musical latino americano a partir de sus trabajos de principios de la década del 70, fusionando jazz, candombe y buen rock, gracias a lo cual llegó a tocar en los 90 con personajes como Jon Anderson entre otros. Pero lamentablemente desde su período ""argentino"" (fines de los 70, principios de los 80) su música se ha convertido en una caricatura de lo que fue algún día, y su persona solo una parodia que ha encontrado un único respaldo en su gracia natural, pero ya nunca mas en su musica, como lo prueba este disco y su sucesor ""Black"", donde inevitablemente se llega a la conclusión que la inspiración se ha perdido hace mucho tiempo y su unión con los mediocres Ketama es una prueba de ello . Ambos discos están condenados como todos sus últimos trabajos a las bateas de liquidación. A ponerse las pilas y a otra cosa!!!."
3,Mediocre,"Este CD de Rada me decepciono. La musica es buena en composicion y ritmo, pero el album en general no te agarra como para que chapes el fono y le digas a todos los yoruguas de por ai que se lo tienen que comprar."

5,Wonderful book for girls!,A wonderful book for American Girl doll and book collectors!! It gave many ideas of things to make and bake in Kit's time period!!
3,It depends on what's important to you.,"The puppet is adorable and has the right face for me. However, the arms are useless. There are no holes to put your fingers to move the arms. I made my own holes. Had I known about this, I would not have bought the puppet. Although,I'm enamored with the face. And the eyes make a noise as they move around, which may or may not matter.Unless you are in love with the way this puppet looks, I'd look for something more useful. Also, it's a bit short."
4,Great item,Fast shipping and book in very good shape.. exactly as described. Saved lots of money by not buying books from my school
5,RIGHT ON TIME,I was trying to purchase the book at my college bookstore. The book was on order for several weeks. I then decided to order the book on line. This was a blessing because the book was shipped and received in very good condition and it was shipped within 3 days. I was able to get the book and study for an exam I had 4 days later. THANK YOU AMAZON for offering such services. Going forward all of my purchases for books are online.
4,Iudaei Romanum,"The Jewish presence in late Republican and Imperial Rome is an intriguing topic, one that has not received the attention that it deserves. This volume is overall a good account of the Jewish Community of Rome, though as a previous reviewer stated its title is misleading - there is as much about catacombs, inscriptions and the naming patterns of Romanized Jews as there is about the actual history of the Jewish people in ancient Rome.Despite the large amount of technical content, this is a great source of information on Rome's Jewish communities, and reveals the vital, if overlooked social role they played."
5,makes life a bit easier when you want to work on your truck,The hayes manual is almost like having a mechanic standing there talking your through a repair. I've been able to save hundreds of dollars in repairs. And I've been able to learn more of what I might expect when I have to take the truck to the mechanic.
1,slow delivery,"I ordered this for Christmas for my neice as well as 2 magazines for my nephews, her brothers. They received their magazines within 6 weeks. She didn't receive the first one until May, the second arrived in September. She should have received every 2 months. I am looking for a different magazine for her for this year."
1,Takes a long time,When ordering this magazine you have to wait a very long time before the first magazine arrives. I ordered this magazine for my niece in March and it is now May. The first magazine is suppose to arrive late May early June. I cannot give this product a good rating because the product has not yet arrived.
3,Song of the Road (recorded book),"Although the book itself is an excellent example of the genre and the author's work, the first CD was damaged enough to make me regret having given it as a gift."
4,A Title for your review.,I read this book because the title intrigued me. Why would I hire an idiot to invest for me? I was disappointed to discover that the text is instruction on how to do my own investing. Am I idiot enough to invest for myself? You be the judge.
2,dont get it unless,You like a male sent. It so offened me I gave it to a male he liked the smell. How much more could you say. It was gritty too.
3,"Fun, but not the best quality","I love this CD of a band I saw play a few times when I was going to college. For those who enjoy ska, this is for you. The songs are great, but the CD was made when the band was just starting and doesn't catch their best side. Buy the CD and enjoy the music- it really is great"
4,Good CD,"I really liked this CD. The lead vocalist used to live a house behind me and we were good friends and still are, so I got the CD free :-P. I recommend any one that like ska to buy this CD, But if your not in the genre you might not like this CD."
4,Smaller than I thought,This case is small...need a bigger one for a Makarov 9mm....this may fit a Ruger .380 LCP. Other than being small...it looks like a good case.
5,Perfect,"Great quality, perfect item. Would order more. Great seller. I have five piano gun cases. Value was good and of course another good Amazon experience. Thanks"
3,will not fit a taurus model 85 revolver,"when they say small they mean small. this case will not fit a taurus model 85 revolver, it will however SNUGGLY fit a bryco 380. it's a nice case, a tad bit on the bulky side."
4,Greater than Lesser,"Ware's volume was extremely helpful in addressing the ""Open Theism"" matter within Christianity a few years back. Still, I consistently reach for Ware as a theological resource. Companion to ""God's Lesser Glory"". ""Lesser"" is a more issue-specific book, whereas ""Greater"" is a more timeless book on Theology Proper and its practical applications."
4,"3 Fenech classic on 1 disc, WHAT A DEAL !","3 Edwige Fenech's School Teacher flicks on 1 disc. This should be the best-selling DVD of all time. You can forget the bootleg dvd made from crappy VHS source or the high price reg 2 DVD.The down side, there is no Original Italian language and the picture quality is just OK, nowhere near the pristine transfer of NO SHAME release of some of Fenech movies (but NO SHAME released all three titles individually in ITALY last year but no plan on US release)Until NO SHAME annouce its release, this DVD is a must have for all guys that are aware of the name EDWIGE FENECH.Highly recommended !! Order this before it gets Out Of Print."
2,"Edwige Fenech Rocks, but movies lame","The rare glimpses of a nude Edwige Fenech are stunning in the three collection group of schoolteacher movies, but the movies are lame, lame, lame with little memorable except the maked Fenech. The acting is abominable and the production values non-existent. Take a nap instead."
2,Edwige who?,"Ok, I admit it, I got this movie based on one of the reviews here. Hey if it's something anyone who has heard of Edwige Fenech must have means it's gotta be pretty good, right? I wish. There were a few decent nude scenes, but I've seen better from the first Poliece Academy. And there's not much to see there. After seeing this you'll wonder why anyone would want to know the name Edwige Fenech. Maybe she did better skin flicks than what you got here. Admittedly the English translation may be part of the problem, but even if you mute the volume the story just looks terrible. Only get this if you want a few good nude scenes."
2,Wild Tigers I could have done without....,"Wow, I have been waiting for this movie to come out for some time. I must say I was highly disappointed. I stumbled across the film while looking at Fairuza Balk's filmography, I read the synopsis, and I immediately wanted to see it. She is great, however she has a very small role.The rest of the film makes little sense. Without the weird imagery, I think the film would have been around 20 minutes in length. There was little to no character development and the plot was boring and weak. Furthermore, there was no real climax nor any resolution. The movie just ends...and does not leave you pondering over anything except what you could have been doing other than watching this movie.From the reviews I read online and the theatrical trailer, I was expecting a ""disturbing teen angst"" movie...something with emotion and it was none of that. If you must see this film, I highly recommend downloading it or renting it...it is not worth buying."
4,I really liked this movie,"I understand the negative feelings that many feel, because the film is very unsatisfying in its narrative, but I think the visuals were so amazing that I didn't really mind. But if you are looking for a coherent film with strong character development and well written scenes look elsewhere. I found it to be dreamy/hazy enough that I could overlook the lack of scenes and at least feel good about the film. And I thought the acting was interesting and funny, great soundtrack and I was pretty entertained throughout. There were only a few bad segments (Mother berating son about dropping groceries), which were pretty cliche and unnecessary for me. All I can say is if you are into photography, enjoy pleasing visuals and are used to European cinema (which sometimes doesn't give you as much information as American films) than you may like this movie. If not, you probably won't."
5,beautiful. amazing. ground-breaking. experimental,"this is an amazing film. ground-breaking cinematography. experimental. poetic. if you don't like art films- you shouldn't watch this. this movie is for people that really appreciate something totally different. it's a coming of age gay love story, which isn't anything new, but the visuals are so stunning that the movie will blow you away. i'm not gay, and i think any open minded straight person can appreciate this film- you don't have to be gay to get it."
2,Very Slow Film,"If you are into high action or full detailed storylines, this movie is not for you. Otherwise, the low volume in the voices, the extra wobbly camera angles, and real landscape adds some idea that this is a low budget film. This movie is not for young eyes to see because of some sexuality involving young teens, and adult language."
1,Think Twice Before Buying!,"This movie is even more muddled and hard to follow than most customer reviews tend to indicate. As a fan of foreign films, I am accustomed to storylines that do not follow the Hollywood formula, but didn't just abandon the formula, it was painful to watch. Some scenes were so odd that I have to wonder what the director was thinking, while others clearly didn't play out as the director intended. The pacing was glacial, the acting was stiff and wooden and the characters were two dimensional bordering on stereotypical. Save your money and buy this one at a yard sale for 50 cents."
3,a very slice-of-life movie i suppose,"this movie was not bad to watch, it just didn't captivate me. it felt like the very slice-of-life movie that it was, with all of the context an observer would have if they just randomly popped into your life too. i guess it was about how horrible middle school is. it was nothing special."
5,what i expected,"was what i got. its a great, clear ipod case, its not as scratch resistant as i would like but then again im pretty hard on my ipod. would recommend to whover is looking for an ipod case."
2,Not exactly what I was expecting.,"Just bought this casing yesterday, and I already have a bad attitude towards it. I also own a Griffin FM transmitter. After placing the Ipod in the case, I tried to plug in the transmitter...........no such luck!! The case is too bulky on the bottom, and does not allow the transmitter to be plugged into the Ipod. Poor design by this company, considering they designed both items!!! Try another company."
4,Griffin 9973-CLR5G iClear Case for iPod Video,Hands down the best clear plastic case for the money. My son broke the original case I had bought on Ebay and after 2 or 3 different case I ran across this one. Great case and a snug fit. Worth every penny. Ordered mine from Ace Photo
2,Not as advertised!,"I orded this case instead of others based on the fact that one of the photos shows it with a lanyard attached, so I thought I was getting a case with a lanyard. Not so much. The case seems to be decent, not great. Doesn't feel as sturdy as I thought it would. That, combined with the lack of a lanyard, earns it 2 stars IMHO."
4,The Best Out There,"This is the case I've been looking for - a clear case for my 60 GB video iPod. If fits very snugly, and it protects the screen very well. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is for 2 reasons. First, before I even used it there were some minor scratches on the case where the screen would be. I've noticed this problem in other reviews too. Second, there are weird air bubbles between the screen and the case causing minor discoloration. Its not noticeable enough to really care though. Overall, it is a great case that is not overly bulky, and it does not take away from the look or feel of the iPod's original design."
4,Does what it says it does,"The case looks nice and fits nicely. The only problem (other than the price tag) is that it does not easily open. I have ihome speakers that the ipod with case does not fit into, and to get the case open you have to stick something in it and jiggle around... I used a credit card. It's frustrating, but as a case it works fine."
4,value for money,"even though i have been reading all these bad and negative feedback on these ipod tune centers, yet my experience was totally different.I bought 2 of them, one for me and the other for a friend of mine...and we both live it!The sound quality is fine, not superb, but really good and accessing online radio stations is really cool...all this with a 17$ deal! to me is really worth every penny...i highly recommend this prodcut...especially with that price!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I've been waiting months to get my hands on this item and what a disappointment. The menu does not fill the screen on a regular 4:6 TV; there's a bar on the left and the words get cut off on the bottom - and it doesn't even look square. The menu navigation is slow and I couldn't even change any settings. Like I said, very disappointing."
3,Unless you're really into humor grab BOCA 2001 instead,"While I agree that SOME of the vocals on here are extremely funny and well done I was not as happy with it as I'd hoped. I found a lot of it is talking and some of the songs are just plain stupid.Being a college a cappella singer myself, I really appreciate good vocals. However, My Name Is Not Merv Griffin and the Cheescake Truck, for example, are not songs I'd want to listen to over and over. While One More Minute and Berkeley school drop out are very well done, they just aren't enough to make up for the overall CD. I""m a huge a cappella collector so I can mix it with other CDs but it's not one of BOCA's betters. (The name, however, is perfect!)"
1,YUCK,"I recently heard this Cd at one of friends house. And that was one of my worst listining experiance ever. This Cd is so boring and bland that you cant bear it for long. No music nothing only some horrible sounds. they try to do some thing tribal or world music, but all they come up with a crap, the sound is very very english. overall its a big waste f time and money"
4,The Lost Melody Rediscovered,"Adiemus is a haunting composition brilliantly realised on CD. I heard it on radio in the late 1990s when it was released and it took me until a month ago to track it down. I particularly like the lyrics being ""non-language"", a bit like scat singing for a classically trained singer. I was worried that the rest of the album would not measure up to the standard set by the first and most popular track. I needn't have worried!"
4,The Start of Something Exciting,"Karl Jenkins does what the Moody Blues and Emerson, Lake and Palmer did in the 70's - marry ""modern"" sound with a professional orchestra. Fans may recognize one of the cuts from the current Delta Airlines ads. Karl is also responsible for the DeBeers Diamond commercial (see his album ""Diamond Music""). Miriam Shockley's voice becomes a representation from both eastern and western cultures. Watch for Karl Jenkins and Miriam Shockley in the future (actually, if you like this album, run, don't walk and purchase Adiemus 2: Cantata Mundi - it gets 5 stars in my book!!)"
2,"""World Music?"" - I think not","Admittedly, I pick this up on a whim when it been misfiled with Tchaikovsky. This should have given me a hint - the store didn't know how to classify this piece.The strong / interesting points for me were the percussion arrangements and the London Philharmonic. The percussion is imaginative and a big plus on an otherwise questionable work.I found it interesting reading the pedantic liner notes that explain how classical structures such as the rondo had been used. The liner also explained that words didn't cut it - phonetics were the way to the world music experience. Baloney... If you change ""phonetics"" to ""gibberish"" you will be closer to what is on the CD.If you are looking for easy listening ""adagio"" music (e.g., the work of Secret Garden or solo piano work of David Lanz, Michael Jones, George Winston), this is not for you.This CD just is not ready for prime time."
2,slow and boring--only good for one song.,"I originally purchased this CD because of the infamous ""Delta airline"" song. After listening to the CD, I was surprised by all the excellent reviews. I agree with the reviewer who gave it one star, this CD is boring and monotonous. I should've bought Pure Moods instead."
3,"Repetitve, but pretty","Some of the songs were absolutely gorgeous, but on the whole, they were very VERY repetitive. About halfway through, you're completely sick of them because they keep doing the same thing over and over again. It's an interesting cd, and very pretty, but not exactly worth your money, I don't think. Compared to some of the other cds in this genre, this isn't one of the better ones."
3,Adiemus: New Age Meets Medieval,"I danced to Adiemus and thought it was amazing; however, just listening to it didn't do the same thing for me. I am going back to Andrea Bocelli or Mozart's Mass or Handel's Messiah for true passion."
5,Simply Amazing.,"I first became aware of Adiemus after purchasing the Pure Moods I CD (the first track of this CD, ""Adiemus"", is track 08). Amazed at how the vocals seemed as if the whole of a small nation were singing, I purchased this CD, and Adiemus quickly became my favourite group -- of any genre of music. Potential Adiemus fans and collection builders should begin here.Although all the songs feature extended phonetic vocals, the songs vary in intensity and fervor. ""Adiemus,"" ""In Caelum Fero,"" the heightening-in-crescendo ""Cantus Iteratus"" and ""Kayama"" are among the more bombastic songs. Complementing (not contrasting) these songs are the more mellow ""Cantus Insolitus,"" ""Amate Adea"" (the best song on the CD, IMO), and ""Hymn,"" the perfect 'benediction' of sorts for the collection of music. The other tracks hover in between these two distinctions.If intensity is what you seek, your search ends with Adiemus. Wherever you want to go, their music will take you there -- and surely beyond."
4,What Great Barr Primary School Think...,"we are children from the above school, one of our teachers bought the album songs of sancrury and now Adiemus is the title and ending song for every assembly we all love it and it is very catchy we all are hoping to get a copy of this cd for each year group soon and our year group -yr 6 have even started lyrical daces to it, to the creator we give appluse for such a phnominal song and we will listen for the whole of our school lifesigned class 6B age 11 Great Barr Primary school"
5,Beautiful music,Great music. I'm not a new age music person but this is a great CD. Music was used in Jetman over the Grand Canyon. You tube it.
1,don't buy this one!,"I bought this one because I loved the Pure Moods CD and saw that many people had bought this one, too. This CD is boring and uninspired; I wished I hadn't bought it. This one will be hanging as a tree decoration in time for the holidays."
2,Another world,"I'm pretty close to not calling this ""music"" but more like sound effects or soul experimentation.Seen from a musical point of view, it's kinda boring. No excitement, no surprises, no story, no punchline. But I guess that's what new age is all about.But it certainly is beautiful, very harmonic. And it makes you relax, relax, relax."
2,There are better New Age albums out there,"I'm not sure how to refer to song which happens to contain the name of the band. I'd call it the title track but that's what you call a song that shares the album title, not the band name. Anyways, ""Adiemus"" is the catchiest song on here and nothing else comes close except for ""Kayama"" which just sounds like it's trying to copy ""Adiemus"". I'm aware that this isn't really the type of music that's supposed to have catchy songs but even background music should have a sense of being able to stand alone.Other songs such as ""In Caelum Fero"" and ""Amate Adea"" have great beginnings but don't go anywhere positive and that's saying something for the former seeing as how it's an 11 minute song. The only other song that's holding this together is the ending ""Hymn"" which is okay but seems like more of an interlude.If you're looking for New Age music, you can do better than this."
5,wonderful hybrid of classical and New Age,"I had actually heard the title track for the first time on an HBO animated series about the bible. The song haunted me until I found out it was on Pure Moods. However, the other songs are just as inspiring and melodic. Miriam Stockley has an incredible vocal range! What I found most impressive was the use of the words as notes! Each word, or syllable, was used in a way not unlike notes played on an intsrument. However, these songs progress into more complicated patterns, so if you don't have the patience, then you'll hate the album. My favorite song? Tintinnabulum!!!"
1,"Monotonous, repetitive nonsense syllables--not worth buying.","I bought this album on the strength of some of the highly favorable reviews at this website. All I can say is that tastes certainly differ. I consider this the most monotonous, repetitive, uninteresting album I have ever bought. I plan to donate it to our library sale, and hope someone else likes it--I sure don't. I could barely get through one listen."
4,"""adi adi um bayae""","Mmmm. When I was told that there was no meaning to the actual vocal sounds being sung, I sort of, wondered a little. It seemed a bit like intellectual musical masturbation to me (excuse my language) . But then, I sat and thought. All those bands I listen to that sing in Gaelic or use really esoteric lyrics. Why do I listen to them? Aaah...the melody, the rythym, the atmosphere. It's just sound and form. Adiemus is pure melody and is like an impressionist's painting of all things ""world music and ethnicy!!"" The talent involved in making this album is unquestionable and there are one or two tracks that really up lift the soul. I just wish that person hadn't mentioned the meaningless lyrics......""adi adi um bayae - adi um adi um ayae""......sorry just can't get them out of my head."
4,The music is captivating,"This music is hypnotic and captivating for me, which is plenty. Criticisms about nonsense words are nonsense to me. Many musicians use such nonsense words without drawing criticism for it, from jazz scat singing to the Beatles. The vocals sound roughly polynesian to me, and I don't care if the words make logical sense, but only how they sound. They sound wonderful, buy the CD, it's a gem."
4,Great BGM for programming heros,"The first time I played this CD was on the weekend in the office (sigh) cranking out Visual Basic code. I left it on repeat the whole day.The idea of music that has the form of vocal music but substitutes nonsense syllables for the words is disturbing, particularly when some of it music reminds me of religious music which has both nourishing CONTENT as well as form.But for BGM for the code-hacker, this CD hits the spot. No concentration-disturbing intellectual content ;-)"
3,"As Jazz, OK....As Tango, Stinky Stuff","I bought this CD on recommendation from an avant-garde tango fan. The first time I listened I put it back on my shelf convinced that it was garbage. But recently, it became time to listen to it with new ears. I found a few things to like, notably Django Reinhardt's Nuages, Astor Piazzolla's Decarisimo, and Pat Metheny's Antonia. Even a couple of bandleader Iiro Rantala's own compositions were enjoyable. The only song that really grates is Loro where they work in the singing parrot...a stupid gimmick at best. As jazz, the album is not bad, but if you are expecting tango, be prepared for some stinky stuff. I charitably rate the album three stars for the jazz but one star for the tango."
5,a true original drummer and musician,"A great cd that deserved much more attention its because of the lousy label its on BIG WORLD!! they also put out Danny Gottlieb's Brooklyn Blues ,Neil Weiss takes advantage of great fusion musicians !! This is a great cd Kenwood is in his fine and freest form a true master of the modern drums !!!"
3,Uneven,"So so arrangements and mediocre material make this a boring release from a fairly good drummer.Teen Town is all right,but some of the other pieces are covers for the smooth jazz crowd.The recording sounds muddy and lacking.All in all,a waste of talent."
4,"Works well, a few strange things though.","This product saved me during grad school finals time when all-day sessions in the library totally screwed up my back. I ordered a nada back-up after a few people on a web forum recommended it.One strange thing is that it feels like I have to wear the product upside-down for the padded parts of the strap to line-up correctly with my knees, but it is at any rate one of the best posture correcting devices I've ever used, and it always accompanies me to any time I have to sit and read/study for long hours.It also corrects posture. After finals time, I went on vacation and noticed that for several weeks my sitting and standing posture were incredible!"
2,nada ain't much,"The Nada Chair product has not proven that beneficial. I put in on whenever I need to sit for a lengthy period of time(15 minutes or longer). My knees seem to do all the work...but I still find myself slouching. I am aware of it sort of pushing my lower back and on occasion sit up straight. Bottom line is that it does not give much actual support to the point where I have to sit erect. As to my condition, I suffer from lower back pain caused by five desicated discs three of which are bulging. It helps some...just not much."
3,X games DVD review,I thought the video had footage of the WINTER xgames also - but did not ... sucks because that's why i bought it. oh well. not too big of a deal - but pretty cool footage anyway :)
4,A Moody Neighbor,"Lisa Arana's lyrics are true and to the heart. There are no symbols of passivity nor are there any frills in this poignant first outing by a new and upcoming performer/songwriter. Her collection of haunting melodies and folkish background lends a setting to the heart of this artist. Songs like ""Dakota"" and ""Green River"" take the listener to the center of smalltown while others like ""Sleepwalking"" and ""The Sky"" are wonderful ventures into the mainstream. With just voice and guitars, Miss Arana has set a high standard for her future recordings. I look forward to the next."
3,Good but not the best,"Despite the fact that I love Bleach, I found this album to be substandard compared to what the had done in the past. It was still a great album but I felt they relied too much on the lyrics and the actual music behind them on a few of the songs was lacking; some of the lyrics, to specific songs, weren't of the usual Bleach caliber. All in all it's a good CD but not their best by a long shot."
2,poor sound,I will blame the old recording technology. Sound like the first generation of a transistor sound. Can not get the feeling except the rhythm.
4,Rostropovich Restrospective,"I like this 2 CD set. The first CD consists of the Dvorak and Schumann Cello Concertos, Tchaikovsky's Andante Cantabile and Glazunov's lovely Chant du Menestrel. The Second consists of lesser, but still lovely, cello pieces and transcriptions from Rachmaninov, Chopin, Schubert and Schumann. I wanted a restrospective of Rostropovitch and this fits the bill: classic cello works played by a master of the cello. To my ear and fancy, he does a much better job on the Schumann Cello Concerto than Jacqueline du Pre (EMI Classics). Her's is agitation; his is romanticism."
3,An OK product for an OK price...,"Not too bad. The flight is good but consistency and durability could be better... Not sure it deserves a 20-word review. Does it? Does it not? OK, I think it's 20 now."
4,a little cooler than enter the matrix,"the samurai dojo scenes won me over, they were pretty creepy. this game has a few bugs in it as do most ported games, but it was fun. basically follows the films' storyline with a few detours here and there, the end boss fight sucked but the rest of the game was awesome"
1,"Buggy-Buggy, Crash-Crash, Your PC go BOOM!","Its always a bad sign to buy a game, take it home and find a card inside the package directing you a website containing two big patches for the game. Path of Neo is a cool concept that got the rush-rush-rush treatment in my opinion.After applying the patches, the game got a little further along before it crashed and burned, taking my PC with it. Cool, the game comes with its own version of Agent Smith! The game would also freeze if I changed controller options, oh DEAR!!This is a trend in PC gaming - releasing games that are not ready for prime time then patching up the code later. Unfortunately, the patches for Path of Neo don't seem to work. Oops.The upside is that I did not pay full price for The Buggy Path of Neo, but paying anything for a broken game is too much. Buy it at your own risk.."
3,Not what I hoped for.,"I bought this game while I was deployed. I had played through the entire thing no my XBOX back in the day. Doesn't transfer so well onto a PC. Controls are difficult and even with an XBOX 360 controller, it just doesn't feel right. Graphics could've easily been improved for a PC, but I would venture to say that they look worse than they did on the XBOX."
2,Waste of $50,"First of all the graphics, textures, model movements, all of it would be great a few years ago, but now it lacks behind. Also, the first level was impossible to aim for some reason, and the AI would pulverize me because I couldnt hit them. Then, after that the level when escaping the office was so boring, and linear that I then pulled the CD out of my Drive, took it to the back yard, covered it in lighter fluid and let it burn. Ruin my grass, and my time, and my money... Sorry for those who love it, but the game was horrible in my perspective."
5,We love this thing!! :D,"Great 'lil toy! My daughter loves it! We're in the car a lot, and this has quickly become my 1 yr old daughter's favorite toy! The bone and dog's ears have crinkle paper inside that she loves to grab and squeeze, the nose is a button that makes the dog bark, and theres a bell in there somewhere that jingles when ya shake it! We named him Dangleberry, hahaha! We love this thing!! :D~ B"
4,Pupsqueek doesn't bark,"Me and baby just love this pupsqueak. It keeps her attention well. She loves the rattles in the feet and to chew on his dog bone. What we don't like is that the box in the nose that makes the bark, never worked and still doesn't work. We would rate it higher if it did. She still likes to play with it well enough that I didn't go to the trouble to send it back. I just want people to know."
5,love it,"great toy!!! my daugther loved this toy since she was like 2 months and has not gotten tired of it since. These toys are sooooo well made! They say just spot wash but i have thrown it int he wash and dryer literally over 50 times and not only is it still in PERFECT condition, not a single seam has broken and the electronic barjing box in the doggie tummy still barks!!! So well made and so well loved....great toy!!!"
3,It doesnt Bark..,I love the puppy and so does my daughter.BUT sadly it doesnt bark like it should.At least it is cute :) so we will keep it. She doesnt care if it makes noise or not
4,Heartbreakers,My name is bob.I came from USSR.Last time i watched a movie colled heardbreakers.Actuaiiy i dont like it but i like it becouse there was a butefuleeeeeeeeee GILER.But i toled u a litlle bet about what mouve.It is about a mouther and doughter. theye just met withe millioners and try to get marred withe them.BUT I DONT PREFER U TO WATCHE THAT MOVIE GUYS and GIRLS
4,I made a mistake and I'm glad I did...,"I was searching for the Eagles ""Long Run"" CD and came across this. I bought it and I'm glad I did. Good book."
3,Good cheap holster,I service ATMs for a living and needed a holsters to conceal my snub nose 357. The material is a durable ballistic nylon with some type of form inside it. When adjusting the velcro i noticed some of the velcro hooks broke off into the material it was meshing with. Maybe i should have worked it a little bit before adjusting.Regardless the holster is a the best thing you will find beside going up in price to a leather one.
5,A Classic!,"This is one of those CD's that wasn't all that popular, with the exception of, ""She's a Beauty""; however, it is an outstanding album. It rocks and 's a little funky and simply a great collection of music."
5,I Love The Tubes,"To be honest, I'm sick of She's a Beauty. They played the hell out of it on the radio, And MTV. The Tubes are so much better, Than that song. I got to meet the whole band, A few years ago(it's 2008 still) And Fee was His usual Cool self, But things weren't going right that day. The plane that Roger took to get to Minnesota was way late, And the instruments from the rental company were too. I told Fee about My getting to see Them in Oakland, Back when drawing a larger crowd was easier. Fee replied"" How the mighty have fallen"". Fee that's a part of life, But the fans You, And the Tubes created love You'll, And will never forget all the fun We had at Your shows. The show that night was great, And Fee was at His very best. They played several of these songs. They're Classics. Just like The Tubes. Rock Forever Tubes, And Thank You."
5,Great Beginner's Book,Very helpful and full of tricks. I already know chords so the music theory is what I really needed. This book explained it in a simple way plus all chords are included.
2,Nothing special,This was made to sound like it was such a special way of learning the guitar and it was a bust for me. I don't see where it's anything special and it's over priced for what you get. There are a lot of cheaper books out there that will teach you the same things. Don't be fooled by the hype.
3,"Chinese version of ""Phantom of theOpera""","Since the silent days of cinema, China had been influenced by the films and the stories from the west.And when the talkies came along, Chinese film studios were there to put their own spin on a popular genre. In this case, ""Song at Midnight"" is the Chinese version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" set during World War II, with the Phantom in this case affiliated with the Kuomintang. Much care is put into the makeup department and the staging of the musical numbers. But the Chinese didn't limit themselves to a retelling of Gothic romance. There is action, intrigue, revenge - all the goodstuff that makes for a moody horror film. The quality of this film is average, since the negatives reportedly no longer exist. Still it is a work of cinematic art that rivals the horror films of the west."
5,Most awesome fantasy book you'll ever read,"Robert Jordan has created an incredibly disverse, and well though out world. There are several plots going on the intertwine with each other, and the characters are very complex themselves. There's a reason this guy has eleven books in this saga. Awesome read."
3,Tedious...,"I echo the sentiment of other reviewers so I'm making my review short. There is much sash twitching, names that sound identical, and excessive detail for an item that has been described before. If you like the series then this shouldn't be too much of an issue, considering the series starts picking up again at book 11."
3,Robert Jordan Series,"Please refer to my other reviews of the Robert Jordan boxed sets, which was the only way, besides Kindle, to get book one; info on publishing lingo should be part of the data when buying a paperback so it is obvious (without searching for dimensions) the sizes of the books, which in this case considering the length of the books, makes them impossible to handle with any limitations in hand use; the small size means small print, as well, which with aging eye-sight, is also a problem; I've read the series before and was disappointed in the inconsistent quality of the story, but in general, I have enjoyed this series"
2,From Back Cover,"Last Man of Chance - T.J.T.J. Chance is a wild, uninhibited adventurer. Ally Wheeler is one scared little mouse. But she's determined to change all that, and T.J. is her ticket to a brand-new life. If she can hold her own with this sexy rebel, she can do anything!No way is Chance going to be responsible for some city girl who want to dog his heels and have ""adventures."" Of course, if she's looking for a wild time, he can certainly deliver. And the longer Ally stays in Wyoming, the harder it's going to be for him not to do the wild thing with her...Last in Men of Chance series."
2,the wrong author for the job,"Mr. Humphries is a big fan of Tom Waits. Unfortunately, he's mainly a fond of the early Tom, and spends a great deal of this book trying to explain why Swordfishtrombones, Rain Dogs and everything that followed don't live up to Small Change. Tom deserves to have a biography written about him that does justice to his mid-eighties and later work as a period of astonishing innovation and creativity, rather than seeming almost apologetic that he dared to stray from the bars and back alleys of his early work at all."
1,"""Happy"" shoes made in China?","I was a little disappointed to find out that my sandals were made in China; I doubt they're feeling the ""sanuk."" Kind of throws a kink in the company's stony vibe. I figured they were so expensive because they were made here without slave labor. And why not offer a hemp or bamboo model - something sustainable? They need to get with the program and quit being posers. If I'm going to drop fifty bucks on some flip flops, I'll buy them from a company that rocks it like they talk it.I think their advertising is very misleading. ""Working hard in Cardiff unless there's surf?"" Tell that to the people making your shoes in a sweatshop a world away. Posers."
4,Cruiser Shoes for Pat,"Shoes Came within time identified for shipment, and in condition that was described from the advertisement."
2,Doesn't do much,This is a waste. It cover the indoor AC and protects it from dust. It does not keep drafts out.
3,Brief summary,"Fairly good information, but the overview of each model was way too brief to be very informative. A good guide would be much longer."
1,doesn't work,"Received one of these a few months ago and only one of the three inputs worked, so I am still stuck with having to switch the cable back and forth from the DVR to the PS3. Talk about a pain!"
2,Partially works,"I also bought this item based on the multiple positive reviews; however, I've found that it just doesn't work with my MacBook Pro. It works fine with the XBox 360, so I'm assuming it's based upon device signal output strength. As for manufacturing quality, it does feel cheap but then it is cheap so that shouldn't be seen as an unexpected limitation."
1,Does not work,I purchased this item because of the good reviews it has received. It only works with my cable box. It doesn't work with either of the xbox platforms.
2,"Good idea, not for the long haul.","I owned this for about 8 months before it bit the dust. when it does work its a great device, the sound quality is just like going directly into the system but the changing wears quickly and you need to be gentle with it. switching between cables is sometimes difficult because the knob won't want to turn. be careful and extra nice to this if you do buy it. you're better off paying the incredibly extra amount for an HD switcher."
1,Dead on Arrival,Looks like this thing would have done the trick if it worked. Completely disappointed. Switch arrived and the rotating bit was immobile. Nearly broke my fingers trying to budge it.
1,Did not work,"Like most people, my receiver only has one digital audio input. I was using the one digital audio input for my Xbox, and RCA audio cables for my TV. After reading several positive reviews, I decided to give this a try. Initially it worked on my TV, but the other 2 inputs did not work at all. This will be returned."
4,Works as advertised..,"I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now. It was easy to set up, unpack- gather all optical cables- then simple hook up. the package comes with 1 thin toslink cable, and so far sound quality has been good using that as an output toslink cable. The selector works ok, although i would strongly advise to make sure u press the button firmly first then moving the dial to the desired input source. For some reason the clicking sound after placing the dial to the selected source disappeared after a wk of use.(i'm guessing thats from me dialing it carefully.) The materials doesnt look very reliable but thats just me.Its definitely a good buy for $18.86 +good sound +easy set up +quality materials/price and bottom line, it works."
4,Great solution to a very common problem!!!!,"This product is great, that's really all I can say!!!! Easy to set up, easy to use, great quality!!The only thing I can complain about is having to get up to switch channels, but it's not a big deal!!!There's no change in signal strength or sound quality!!! Buy this if you can't afford a new receiver!!!!"
4,Nice device for the price,"I recently purchased a PS3 and was really looking forward to watching dvd's and blu-rays with it. Unfortunately my home theatre sound system did not have enough digital optical inputs to accommodating watching these in surround sound. This device worked well to solve the problem and I now can enjoy 5.1 sound while watching HDTV, DVD, Blu=Ray, and PS3 games. And the price is more than reasonable!"
1,Won't pass through XBOX 360 sound,"I ordered this device so I could toggle the sound between my PC and my XBOX 360 as I have them both sitting at my desk. It works fine for the PC. I have tested all the ports and all my cables, and they work fine. When I plug in the XBOX, I get the red light on the cable indicating that a link is established, but no sound at all. I have tried jiggling the switch and have tested all cables. Not sure what else I can do but return the product. I see other reviews on here where people have got their XBOX to work fine with this toggle...mine does not."
1,Worked for a couple days,"This product is horrible. It worked for only a few days. After a few days my devices weren't getting signals. I fiddled with the thing for a while and figured out that if I pull the connections out to the point of falling out, it works, but the cables have to balance there. Very poor quality."
3,usefull,"the connection to the 1st adaptor does not work upon opening the box. I did not want to send it back because i was excited to start using it. the last 2 work perfect. not bad for 20 bucks. i have not tried to clean and or see what the issue is witht he 1st port.overall ok. i don't need more than 2 inputs so i am not that bummed.have had it for 2 months already, working fine other than the above stated."
3,"Works, but...","This works for me, but only if the total cable length between the source and the destination is 10' or less. I had a 10' monster toslink cable connecting this to my x-box, and a 6' cable connecting this to my receiver, and it did not work. When I replaced the 10' cable with a 4' cable, it worked."
5,"Inexpensive, easy to use, and works perfectly","Light is light - it either works or it doesn't. In this case, it works and the device is very inexpensive. 100% of the light signal gets switched from one of three inputs into the one output. There's nothing more I expect or should expect.Great product. Highly recommend."
1,Doesn't work,"After plugging everything in, the splitter does not output a strong enough signal to be registered. You can clearly see the light shining out of the output cable, but once it's plugged in, the is no audio. Tested all cable individually into output with positive results. Disappointing since this product would have met my needs fairly well."
