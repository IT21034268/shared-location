4,not what i thought it was,this is not what i wanted made a mistake on getting it and before the person maild it i canceld it and he said no
5,Independent Horror Wishes It Was Always This Good,"Beneath The Surface is original, entertaining, and highly-watchable. Writer/director Blake Reigle does a fantastic job of flipping the horror genre on its ear. A must see for any horror fan."
2,Too much introduction and not enough helping,"I bought 2 different relaxation tapes from Amazon. I thought this one was not very good. The lady on the tape spent half of the tape telling me about how important it is to relax. I THINK THAT IS OBVIOUS to most of us. The author also requires you to move your body around which for me is not condusive to relaxing. And finally, 5 minutes after she gets you into the stage 5 of relaxation, the deepest relaxation for this tape, she wakes you up and tells you how refreshed you are. I just wanted to spend more time resting and relaxing and had to get up and turn the tape off, which then had the opposite affect of relaxation, more like aggravation for me."
1,Too much talking / intro before getting into the relaxing,"I agree with the last critique. Half of the tape is ""introduction""."
1,Didn't work,"Unfortunately, this classic game simply didn't work on my Windows XP box.My daughter loves the game at school, where they must run older versions of Windows. But when we installed it at home, it started up with jerky sound that went mute after a minute. A few screens into the game, the cursor disappeared when she was balancing a scale and there was no way to progress past that screen."
1,Game Play,The game doesn't work on my operating system - I have Windows 7. If there's a way to play this game I'd sure like to know.
4,Yup a Classic Math Game!,"This game can get you entertained for hours for your children. It helps develop their matth skills which is improtant. For example, how much chnage you would get when you pay the cash register or how to read time."
2,You should probably look elsewhere,"At the time it was published, there were very few good references on karate and karate history. Since then however, there have been many excellent texts and articles, including some from the same author.While the kara descriptions are excellent, with good photography showing the movements and how they should be done, the kata themselves are not classical versions. They are rather versions taught by Richard Kim, which don't always agree with the originals taught in Okinawa.Also, there are a fair number of incorrect historical references and incorrect translations of kata names (and the kanji is not included either), making most other current history books much more desireable.This would only be a ""must have"" book is you are in the lineage of Richard Kim and want a kata reference, for which it would serve nicely."
1,These are not Okinawan kata!,"I am a 7th dan in Shorin ryu, half Okinawan and have practiced and lived in Okinawa for over 27 yrs since 1969. These kata are strange versions and you will not find anyone doing the kata in this way on Island. I think Pat McCarthy learned these from Mr Richard Kim, where Mr Kim learned them, I don't know. Only the names of these kata are classical, that's it. Why is it most of the foreign self procalimed Okinawan karate experts never lived in Okinawa, they just visit a few times then write a book? Forget about this book and buy a DVD of Zempo Shimabukuro or Takayoshi Nagamine or Shugoro Nakazato if you are curious about Okinawan Shorin ryu kata. Viewing kata isn't a way to learn karate anyway, but interesting for the folks who live in other countries to watch..."
2,Classical Kata of Okinawan Karate,"I appreciate the depth of knowledge and experience of Mr. McCarthy in the realm of martial arts, particularly karate. However, this book would likely be more accurately titled ""Kata of Japanese Karate"" because the techniques he shows in this book are that of perhaps traditional Japanese karate, NOT Okinawan karate that is truly traditional (e.g. Shorin Ryu or closely related styles). I've long wondered if this book would be at all helpful...perhaps it will, but only if I forget the direction to move during a kata."
1,Not classical nor okinawan! Book should be revised!,"The kata versions presented in this book are not classical nor okinawan... period!OK, the book was issued long ago in a time little was known about the subject BUT books CAN and MUST be revised and updated when the author is still living (thats what 2nd and further editions are for!). If not, a continuously re-issued obsolete innaccurate work becomes an anomaly such as this book, misleading prospective buyers and giving a questionable contribution for the actual knowledge of traditional karate!"
5,"A very informative book, for its time.","""Classical Kata,"" is a highly informative book for its time. Published during the mid-80's, we did not know as much then as we do today about the history and meaning of karatedo. I think the collection of photos is simply outstanding as is written text highly informative. I particularly liked ""we need our lives to becomes as much a product of the art, as the art is a product of our lives.""As far as the actual kata are concerned, they are typically Richard Kim's interpretation of Okinawan kata and must therefore be seen as such.People who criticize Mr. McCarthy's work should first learn a little more about what was or was not known about the tradition during the time it was published.The book was a best seller for many years and inspired countless thousands of serious karateka on their journey. Since that time many other great books have been written, including Mr. McCarthy's unprecedented publication entitled the Bubishi.Jim M Victoria B"
5,a first person narrative is one of the best kind of books,"Because it is a first hand account-and who better to tell the story than the person who lived through it?That's why I take offense at the reviewer who said this book is too one-sided. Hello? Would YOU care to live through a New England winter without any modern conveniences? Would YOU like to be taken captive by hostile savages and have your life distrupted and your child die as a result? Perhaps it's not politically correct these days to see indians as savages but excuse me-they raped women and killed children. They burned homes and tortured men. Like it or not that's how many of them were back then. (Notice I didn't say ALL so don't get your dander up.)This book is a look at a person's life and her perspective on it. How she dealt with a tragedy of unknown modern proportions. How she lived through it and what she learned from it.Fascinating stuff, in my opinion."
3,Very One sided,"I loved all of this witches acounts of Wheetamoo, greatest sachem ever! but she was sooooooo one sided! I hated how she talked about the Sachem Wheetamoo. I wish that she was more two-sided and it is NOT understandable of her harsh words tword Wheetamoo or any of the FRIENDLY indians The author is a mean witch with a b!"
4,Necessary American history reading,"Like any old primary source, this autobiographical account can be difficult to dive into, but quickly becomes accessible. Mary rowlandson's first hand account of her captivity by Native Americans and her eventual freedom has helped to shape American literature. While the context is no longer relatable, her emotions and reactions are. I'm not the biggest history buff, but I enjoyed this narrative if only for the sincerity of her story."
5,First book published by American woman,"We, Chapman Billies, Inc. published this edition and Trafalgar Square distributed it for us at first. It has never been out of stock. Of course we think it should get 5 stars, otherwise we/I would not have put our money behind it. Mrs. Rowlandson tells of the attack on her village, the wounding of her youngest child, their being kidnapped,forced to go with her captors for several months in a New England winter, and watch her child die before being ransomed. To expect her to be an enlightened 21st century woman as she tells her story is to be, Ugh, un-brave."
4,Excellent Hair Spray,"This product is excellent. I had to find it online for my wife, who discovered it and has used it for many years. When the regular places no longer had it, she asked me to find it for her. As a licensed beautician, I value her opinion, and continue to order it whenever she asks me to. And her hair is always perfect!"
3,Good Beginners DVD,The teacher is good and very helpful for especially beginners. However if you are looking for a thorough ABS workout I would go for Volume 1. It is great mild exercise programs for a day where you dont want to break the big sweat out.
3,Better ones out there,"To be able to fully use everything on the DVD, you'll need a Pilates ring, a small Pilates ball, hand weights, a stability ball, and a mat, which is almost 50% more equipment than I have or am willing to spend more money and space on.With the exception of a few variations of standard floor crunches, almost ALL of the exercises are standard Pilates floorwork and best suited for intermediate/advanced exercisers. There's not much here for the true beginner, the overweight, or the older exerciser.Workouts range from 4 minutes to 30 minutes and unlike quite a few other DVDs of its type, it's all presented in a bland style that borders on the monotonous.In the end, I traded it in to my local used DVD store. There are better DVDs out there for working your core that require less equipment or none at all. For the beginner who wants a Pilates-style workout, I'd recommend something like Pilates for Dummies, Pilates for Everybody, or Pilates for Inflexible People."
5,An excellent book--practical with great insights!,"Dr. Scarfalotto's book is packed with insights and wisdom. You can use it to immediately improve your life--whether you are hurting or happy!! I highly recommend this book. It is thought provoking, yet so easy and enjoyable to read."
5,Refreshing!,"The Dance of Opposites is one of those books that once you pick it up you can't seem to put it down. You will never look at everyday life in the same way again. This book gives you insight like no other as well as a refreshing twist that you hadn't considered before. We go through each day taking things as they come, when in fact we have the unique ability to change how we perceive the world around us. We just needed to be educated on how to do so. Thank you Dr.Scarfalloto."
5,As Good As It Gets,"This reading is as good as it gets in terms of offering some very thoughtful, provocative explantions on those really difficult questions about life--questions that we as human beings all face. I would recommend this book to anyone who is seriously contemplating the ""meaning of it all"" and doing some deep soul searching. To sum it up, this reading was liberating, stimulating and healing...it changed my entire outlook on life, gave me new points of reference and took the sting out of some of life's most challenging moments."
3,"Great costume, but don't order it from etoys","I love this costume- what came of it. It fits great, no longer has the problem with footholes, and can be easily tucked in for a variety of body types. It's great for a cool Halloween like we have here.That being said, etoys is the worst place to order it. If you look online, you'll find other vendors with the same costume. I received the body but not the mask, gloves, or bandolier. I contacted etoys, who told me they could NOT compelte the costume, even though it was their fault, and would issue a refund after I shipped the costume back at their expense. The result? I have no costume, will not be getting a replacement, and this was the first time I'd bought a halloween costume instead of making it myself."
5,Theo Peoples of The Four Tops,"This is a great single of Theo Peoples of The Four Tops.Formerly of The Temptations that sings ""Stay""He is a gifted singer.Must add to your collection."
3,Theo Peoples,This young man is too talented to have put this CD in circulation. This CD did not do his voice justice.
3,what have they done 2 this CD?,"Actually, I love this album. I think it could be greatest R&B; album of 2004. However I don't like this item. Becoz I can't take MP3 files from this CD. I need MP3 so that I can listen with my little MP3 player. This CD has a kinda protection(I don't know what it is. it's some technological stuff). It can only produce WMA file which my mp3 player doesn't support. I can't even trasfer WMA to MP3.What's worng with this lable, compendia corp(?)?? Theo is not R.kelly. Everybody here(south Korea) dosn't even know his name or face. You should let people listen his music first and MP3 could help promoting this artist a lot. After that process, U can do somethin' on your damn CD! But in this case, Theo's album, you should've care more about CD's booklet or somethin' else rather than this weird magical protection thing."
4,Excellent product,"Works just like my cordless drill. Reversible, variable speed with a clutch. The great thing about cordless drills is the clutch so I can control the max torque applied to set screws without stripping them. However, the batteries always die so when I have a job to do I have to wait to charge the batteries or find that they won't hold a charge anymore. Now I don't have to wait anymore. I think this drill is great. I only wish the chuck were a 1/2 inch. The drill is also bulkier than cordless drills I've owned. But it's a great replacement since I refuse to keep buying expensive batteries. For the price I highly recommend this product."
1,Don't risk it,"I bought this drill from another retailer, and after using it for 2 weeks, the variable speed failed. It only worked at full speed. I took it back and got another one of the exact same model, 2 weeks later, same thing. The variable speed failed again.If it only happened once, it might have been a fluke. But the exact same problem 2 times in a row means that it's inherent in all these drills.Buyer beware."
5,Teacher's Grade: A,"The at-risk students in my 2nd grade classroom thoroughly enjoy this rhyming tale, and it is has been an excellent aid in my efforts to improve their fluency. The bouncy beat of the writing, and the infectious illustrations combine to make the book a welcoming experience, even for children who have difficulty reading."
3,Okay should include straps,Should include the straps was the only issue I had. But I ordered next time I will order one with straps.
2,uneven crap,Cheap like the price. Got them out of the box already bent. Sound worse than my old wires that were missing a few strands. Buzz till the cows come home. Next time will go with a better product. The only reason it gets too stars is becuz it came fast.
1,not worth the purchase,"this album may have beats from stoupe enemy of mankind or whatever his name is, but their not all that great, listening to music, taking small samples blending them over drum beats does not mean you have talent, jus allah is racist and his lyrics are obviously fantasy, he's just some guy from philly who writes down complex phrases and says them over beats, in real life, WEAK!!! and vince paz - a white kid from philly who claims to be muslim and hates gays, i met him when he was in a group called soulcraft, his rhymes and voice may grab ahold of you, but listen to what he really says, he's pathetic along with his self hating (must wish he was'nt white) anti-gay (can't except who he is) wish's he was supernatural cultrally confused little boy."
3,Wow...,"Insane hate mongers/muslum extremists with amazing beats. ""I love pussy, but never the bitch that it's attached to."""
5,"No trick about it, this album is hot","..JMT are ill, beats are off the chain, flows are tight, this is a good album to play anywhere, i got alot of ignorant ass people to open their eyes to the other side of hip hop with this album. PURCHASE IT."
5,get 50 cet out of your cd player.... this is real hip-hop,"simply the best. Classic, visionary, amazing. Think of this as shakespear with an amazing beat. Jedi mind tricks embodies what hip hop truly is, a poet ryhming to an amazing beat.There are no words to describe vbd. just pick it up and throw away all your other rap cds. You'll never listen to them again.Jay-z I hope you get to hear this cd because it puts all of you sellouts to shameCLASSIC"
2,I changed my mind..,"It appears that I can't change what I rated this cd, but I can change my opinion..When I first bought ""violent by design"" I didn't listen to the tracks properly before writing my review; but now that I have, I can honestly say that Jedi Mind Tricks have got to be one of the best hip hop acts around. Vinnie Paz (Vin, Ikon the verbal hologram) is an amazing lyricist and Stoupe is great on the turn tables.. I rate this cd 5/5. =)"
3,Good Everyday Shampoo!,"This is a good everyday shampoo. Peppermint smell, not to overpowering.. just about right. The combination of Peppermint, Lavender and chamomile makes makes your hair feel fresh after a good rinse. The only problem is doesnt lather up as well as other shampoos. Also it is a bit pricey."
5,The whole story - not all stars and stripes,"In this book, John C. Miller gives an excellent account of a man who served the cause of revolution from England - but at a high cost. Miller paints a view of Adams and some of his contemporaries as nothing more than trouble makers with a genius for propaganda. He gives the most balanced view of these times of almost any account I have read of the American Revolution. This is not a book for the sqeamish. I don't think he takes a revisionist viewpoint, but he certainly gives cause to reconsider the motives of Sam Adams, Otis, and others. Any writer talented enough to do that, not obscure the facts, and keep you entertained deserves a thoughtful read. Highly recommend. Even though out of print - it really shouldn't be. It is a classic."
3,Sticks no matter what I have done,"THis is the perfect size pan for one person,,,but it does not cook well without having the food stick to the pan... disappointed"
4,Works and non-toxic,"I don't know how well this works for paninis. I wanted to get a sandwich maker for our toddler but could not find one that wasn't made from teflon. This works well with gluten free bread, and only requires a short press (though I flip to get even on both sides)-30 secs each side to make a nice toasted sandwich that my toddler really likes."
3,"Great promise, lack of followthrough","I was really excited when I opened this as a gift. However, while it says that it will cook both sides, the pan ends up way hotter than the top piece, resulting in an uneven cook. I may just not have gotten the hang of heating it up yet, but I definitely haven't made a perfect panini yet."
5,perfect for a table-top grill,"This makes a great small surface addition to a table-top grill -- makes a couple of eggs the perfect size for a sandwich -- or grills up a sm skillet of hash browns easy (aside for the obvious grilled cheese sandwich etc...) Wood handle stays cool and doesn't add weight, so it's easy to pick up."
4,thisdarkplace*blogspot*com,"Great psycho-thriller read, you find yourself rooting for Jack Orchard as he begins his decent into insanity, and then are dismayed to watch this likeable fellow turn into a raving lunatic. Wonderful Stuff."
5,Gets Results,"When I ordered this video, I thought ""How hard could it really be--it's only 30 minutes long."" But I found out even 30 minutes of Lotte Berk can be VERY hard. The first 15 minutes is upper body work which was challenging but not ridiculously so. (I'm an intermediate exerciser.) But the last 15 minutes of lower body work was really tough for me. I try to do this video 2-3 times a week and I have really seen results. My saddlebag thighs are starting to disappear and my upper leg muscles are looking longer and leaner. I highly recommend this video. It's 30 minutes that gets results!"
4,Very thourough treatment,Very thourough treatment of phase scintillation and angle-of-arrival fluctuations. I am really looking forward to the second volume.
2,Something missing...,"This is an easy read, which was part of the frustration for me. The book provides a good historical analysis of drinking, but does not cover the latest research on the subject in depth. The book is a good book for covering the basics and looking at both Europe and North America. I would recommend the book if you are looking for a quick book that will cover the basics. I thought the chapter on making rationale thinkers consider the negative consequences of drinking overly simplistic and short."
3,"An Entertaining, if Fanciful, Version of WW1 in the Air","This is an amendment of my earlier comments. I had only randomly sampled the book when I wrote my initial review. A thorough reading calls for a reassessment. It seems that this Hall (Bert, not James Norman) was a bit of a con man. His version of life with the French Foreign Legion and the Lafayette Escadrille differs in tone, focus and content from most others...usually to his own advantage. Basically, this reads as terrific entertainment (Mr. Hall depicts himself as an early version of James Bond), with a lot of historical context, but the inaccuracies go beyond mere exaggeration...occasionally into flat out fabrication. Still, if you are a ""completist"" on this topic (WW1 Aerial), you won't want to miss it. It's terrific story telling, but more Biggles than biography. To coin a phrase: ""C'est manifique, mais, c'est ne pas historie..."" (sic)."
4,Very Educational,"This is the tape to have if you want to know how a new human life begins. It takes you on a magical journey from beginning to end magnicfied to over 600,000 times."
5,Simple easy heat,Arrived very fast and was very easy to install. Had it up and working within 15 minutes. Heats my 23' X 25' garage easily and maintains a 50 degree temp. when turned to lowest setting.
4,works good so far,"installed unit FUH 54B with two 30 amp 120 volt circuits. I didn't hard wire it but created a nice 220v outlet and plug for it off a clothes dryer electric heat extension cord/box. I've got a 27' by 23' garage and the unit is possibly undersized, but I'll report back on its performance after a few hard cold days (15 or less oat [1]). oat [1] right now is 34 fahrenheit, and the garage is roasting at a nice 78 fahrenheit with the machine cycling off 12 minutes and on for 6 minutes to maintain the 78 temp. This is not good science because my temp gauge has wide room for error (+/-5).[1] oat = Outside Air Temperature"
5,Works just fine,This works great to slightly warm my 3 car garage workshop. It's way underpowered for a 3 car garage in a cold climate but for here in Southern California it works great. Only used it for a few weeks but it's solidly built so I expect it to keep going for many years.
5,Great Garage Heater,"Was a little hesitant about this heaters ability to heat a 3 car garage, but it truly works. I had it professionally installed by an electrician and it does the trick. I work every evening in my garage in my woodworking shop and this really heats the space up. I only leave it on during the hours that I'm working in the space, but within 10-15 minutes the garage is more than comfortable."
1,NOT worth the money at all!,"I bought this heater for my boyfriend's garage gym to keep him toasty during winter workouts, and we never got it to work optimally. The fan inside broke the first time we tried to run it, and when we replaced that the heat emitted was nominal. I was SO disappointed for the money that I paid."
2,Poor Design & Poor Performance,"I bought this heater to heat a 2-car insulated garage in New England. After installation, I found that the fan would constantly cycle on & off every 1-2 minutes, never staying on long enough to really distribute any heat. I spoke with Marley customer service and they explained that this was by design, that a seperate fan control cut out the fan when the temp was too low. Pretty dumb design if you are trying the heat a cold space. They advised me that I could jumper past the fan switch which entailed dismounmting the entire heater element and fan panel from the box....not any easy task when mounted to the ceiling. I successfully by-passed the fan control so the fan runs 100% when the heater is turned on. But I still find the heater output to be ""tepid"" at best and not capable of raising the temp of the garage more than 10 degrees (from low 30'F). I'm going to move this heater to my basement workshop and get either a 7.5kw or 10kw heater for my garage."""
4,ceiling mount FUH5-4 heater,I wish description would have included a little bit more about the thermostat and how you can set it to maintin a certain temperature. It would be better if the dial had actual temp numbers on it. Otherwise its just trial and error to get the right setting.
2,Not even close to Higgins Clark,"The thing is, it's not a bad read. However, I had the bad guy figured out by chapter three. And we are given such rambling nonsense to slug through - it feels like the editors told her she had to write so many words before she could be finished. WAAAYYY too long."
5,Fast-paced and full of suspense,"I love Wendy Corsi Staub and anxiously await for her next novel to be published. The Final Victim did not disappoint. Just as I thought I had figure out whodunit, a new clue was thrown in. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. Highly recommend."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"I am a loyal fan of Staub's and I await each year when her new novels come out. Needless to say that I waited impatiently for this novel expecting the typical domestic suspense that Staub usually provides, but boy was I disappointed. I was not drawn to this book like the others, this is probably my least favorite out of all of her novels. I normally like it when my favorite authors have really long books because I usually find myself finished with them in a few days but this one just dragged on forever. It's hard to pinpoint my least favorite parts of the book because all of it is my least favorite. I don't know if it was the setting of this book but it hardly compares to the suburban type settings that I've become used to with Staub's work, this book really didn't do it for me."
2,A lacklustre sequel to a very mediocre album...........,"There's more of the same on ""Sixties Mix Volume 2"" as appeared on the first installment. Session musicians and uncredited vocalists trying to re-create the hits of the 60s with results ranging from *average* to *abysmal*. 'Stars On 45' get in on the act this time around, but thankfully this isn't one of their albums (which are reasonably good, by the way). Worth buying because of the low-price aspect, but there's nothing much on the CD that sells it to you.Jon."
4,Great Job Ladies!,"Fun CD with great praise lyrics. I think this is the same Kate Miner that sang with Darrell Evans??? Anyways, good praise and worship CD. This will bless adults and teen girls alike."
4,Excellent Gift,I purchased this CD with Mary Simpson's book 'Girlfriendship'. WOW!! The book is amazing and the CD does NOT disappoint. It has compilation of artists and songs is top notch!
2,overwhelming,"I do not doubt that this is made of the finest ingredients. I had heard of how amazing this perfume was and how it is made with each bottle being hand poured etc... However, it is incredibly strong and seemed to have a single note of Pikaki/Hawaiian Jasmine which smelled very similar to Gardenia. That may not be the case but it is how it smelled. I get that quality oils do not fade off easily but this was too intense. I could never detect any other notes to soften seemingly pure Gardenia into a unique fragrance. I appreciate perfumes that do not fade but this gave me a two day headache because it wouldn't go away."
5,The Best Ever - This Fragrance Rocks!!,"Over the last few days I went on a bit of perfume shopping frenzy ordering up all types of ""cult oils"". Some of those included Child, Kai, Monyette Paris, and Sage Machado's - Amethyst, Moon, Black Onyx. ""Child"" blows all of the others completely out of the water and as far as I'm concerned the money that I spent on the other crap was a waste and I could have racked up on Child. This is the best fragrance yet. It really is addictive. I love to smell myself = ). I have never been that crazy about any other scent. Its a beautiful fragrance that makes you feel so fresh and feminine. I mean, you're not running around smelling like a bouquet - Its a clean, classy scent! If you are seriously thinking about this and having any doubts - rest assured you're looking at probably one the best ""cult"" oils out there. You should get it today!! And if you don't - well, thats just more for me!! I'm hooked = )"
4,Lush scent....revisited,"I bought Child over a year ago and was not crazy about the scent because it smelled sticky sweet like gardenia. I put it away and forgot about it. Recently, I read in another magazine about its cult following and I pulled it out to give it another try. I wore it for a couple of days and boy am I glad I did. Child lingers on my skin and clothes and smells entirely unique, like clean, warm skin but I feel like it's my own lush pheremones. Give it a second and third chance if you don't take to the scent right away. Child will change your mind."
1,Very Disappointing!!,"My friend and I both purchased the large roll on Child Perfume along with the body cream. It smells wonderful for about 30-45 minutes, and then all traces of the fragrance are gone. I would have thought it might have been my body chemistry, but it is the same for my friend. I will say, she has the smaller size perfume, and for whatever reason, it seems to stay on longer. For such an expensive perfume ($98), I really expected more."
3,There are better...,"I have used this book in an independent study in Geometry of Differential Forms. It did not take me too long to start looking for other references. There is something about its content that makes it diffucult to follow. May be it's too wordy. There are several misprints in notation. After I few weeks of study, I turned to Morita's Geometry of Differential Forms. The mathematical presentation is much clear and it's only 300 pages. I really like Frankel's book mainly for its application to physics. But with respect to the math, I recommend Morita's and Thirring monographs."
2,I don't like it,"Frankel's text is comprehensive and thick, but it has very little other than that going for it. It is sloppy, as noted in other reviews; very wordy; terms are defined after they're introduced - sometimes hundreds of pages after; notation is a bit weird, although that's a minor problem; But most of all, it just doesn't explain things well. It even doesn't have a lot of pictures to compensate for the lack of good textual explanations! This is probably the result of not defining things carefully and in a chronological order. Many times reading it I'd get the feeling the author didn't have the patience to spell out his reasoning and would just degenerate into nonsensical symbolic manipulations. I'm really sorry, but my opinion of this text is really low. As a reference for someone who already knows the material this is barely sufficient. For self study it is a disaster! Avoid it at all costs."
2,"Bad language, much information","As the other reviewers say, it is obvious that the author as put alot of work into this book. It is huge.However, the author could have spent more time making it more readable. The writing is not good: sentences are often not comprehensible, and the punctuation is often confusing. In one passage, he tries to explain addition modulo 2, and says that the rule ""1+1=0"" is ""inspired by the fact that odd+odd=even"". It *is* precisely that fact, it is not merely ""inspired"" by it.In addition to the bad language, he often omits proofs, and is not rigorous in his definitions. The notation is often confusing.Certain parts of the book are good though - but only after reading them three or more times to understand what is really being said."
4,Solid Workout that Works,"If you like Joyce's books, you will like this dvd. It's a no-nonsense pyramid superset workout following the plan in her book, ""Definition"". The video is simply done, but I think that's OK. The workout is hard enough that I don't have time to want to be entertained...I'm too busy building muscle! And isn't that the point?"
1,Couldn't even watch it!,"I can't really comment on the dvd's content--I only watched a few minutes. So let me tell you why I threw the dvd in the trash after barely even watching it. The lady's thick New York accent was a really annoying turn off. Plus she is old(and I don't mean to be rude by saying that). I prefer to work out with an instructor my age with a charasmatic personality and a body that I wish I had. I sooo did not get my needs met with this lame dvd. Unless you're old and/or deaf, don't waste your money! Try Crunch Total Resculpt or any of the Karen Voight dvds instead."
1,lied about condition of the book,I was very disappointed when I received by book with underlining through out the entire book. It was listed under being brand new and I'm pretty sure brand new books do not have writing all over them...very disappointing
5,Possitively great,I just love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. This is the greatest thing to watch.I like to watch these with close captioing because they talk so low and their slang is tough to follow sometimes. So if I can't hear them at least I can read what they so to follow along. But the subtitling doesn't work on the DVD player. The close captioing worked from the TV though. SO all was GOOD!!!
3,Agatha Christie's Miss Marple Gift Set,"The music is so good!! The film of ""Murder is anounced"" is perfect but the other two are just ok, average level.Also, I bought over 60 of Agatha Christie's books and I would like to introduce her to u, the best female writer in the world I think. 2007/1/11"
4,big fan of this Miss Marple,The movies are just as I remember. Would have prefered that they not be in the segments that were shown on PBS each week. Would have liked the movie to be without a break.
5,Joan Hickson,"I prefer Jaon Hickson ahead of all the other Miss Marples, with Margaret Rutherford a close second.Thoroughly enjoyable."
4,"Joan Hickson - The ""Serious"" Miss Marple","I like Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, though she plays a more serious version of the character than my favorite, Geraldine McEwan. Joan Hickson, however, is a formidable actress, and presents a very believeable Miss Marple. This series presents three movies (The Body in the Library, A Murder is Announced and A Pocketful of Rye). All are excellent and well worth the money I paid for the set!"
4,Miss Marple,"If you enjoyed the original television presentation of these mysteries you will like this DVD set. I just wish the images were clearer and had less visual noise. The picture quality is significantly inferior to the Midsomer Murder DVD sets ordered around the same time. Still, I'd rather have these than be without."
5,Wonderful movies - we loved them,"Joan Hickson is the ""real"" Miss Marple. She looks like Miss Marple, she acts like Miss Marple - she IS MIss Marple. We have the complete set, this 3 episode set and another 6 episode box set, of the Joan Hickson Miss Marples and enjoy watching them again and again. Delightful. Good mysteries, superb acting, excellent writing, perfect characterizations. Can't recommend them highly enough. We watched part of one episode of the current Miss Marple series, and believe me, it doesn't hold a candle to these."
5,Excellent!,"Agatha Christie's Miss Marple Gift SetThis is an excellent gift for yourself or another Agatha Christie mystery buff. Joan Hickson is, as usual, a delightful, perceptive detective wrapped up in wool. A wonderful quiet night entertainment."
5,Top Notch British done Joan Hickson as Miss Marple,"Joan Hickson was considered the best Miss Marple by Agatha Christie, and the creator should know. The Joan Hickson as Miss Marple movies can't get any better. She's the epitome of the Jane Marple character. The locations are superb."
5,Joan Hickson is Wonderful!,"These episodes completed the missing pieces in my Miss Marple collection featuring the incomparable Joan Hickson, a master of subtly conveying Agatha Christie's illumination of Jungian psychology."
3,Good but tricky,"Like a number of the other reviews mentioned, the PSUS4 works fine as a printserver but the included setup software isn't worth even removing from the box. I am by no means a networking expert but I had the time to tinker with the device and found that you really need to be ready to configure the PSUS4 directly using your browser and then configure each computer for local printing by creating a new TCP/IP port using the IP address of the unit and configuring it for printing to ""USB1"". If this sounds complicated it really isn't and with a bit of searching you can find quick and easy instructions from an article on the Linksys website (note the lack of mentioning USB1 in the article).Long story short, don't buy this if you want plug and play but if you have a basic understanding of networking you will find this works fine after a bit of a painful initial setup. I found that it took much longer just to find the information I needed than actually setting up the unit."
1,WARNING: Incompatable with HP Photosmart 7550,"I buy a lot of Linksys products and have been very happy with them, so I did not hesitate to pick up one of these for my HP Photosmart 7550. However, after a couple days of not being able to print, I called tech support at Linksys and was informed that the PSUS4 is NOT compatable with my printer. Interesting, Linksys knows this, but does not provide this information on their website (the tech support technician said it was an ""internal-only document"")."
3,"Great product, kinda ""special""","When I bought this product, it was almost impossible to get a compatibility list from Linksys, I called them and the support technician never wanted to provide a list of supported printers, not even after speaking to his manager, I had to use forums all over the Internet.I did later find out that it worked well with my old Epson printer, but it never worked with my new lexmark printer, know I have it as just a ""switch"" with ""special"" printer server capabilities which I can't enjoy as per compatibility issues, I just hope one day linksys will be a bit more conscious and provide more support for their products."
3,Good Product,This server works great with my Epson printer. Set up was not as straight forward as company claimed. It took about three hours and some trail and error with some of the settings before it began to work correctly with the two computers on my system. I would still recommend it as I tried other print servers that I could not get to work at all.
4,good buy.,This little Print Server is worth the $$. Works fine with my new HP LJ 1012 printer. The 4-port switch is an added bonus and is auto sensing so you won't need a cross-over.
1,I want to sell mine,"I got mine on Ebay thinking I was going to improve my life and eliminate trips up the stairs, share the printer between pc users.After an error fraught installation, it worked once or twice for printing and never for scanning. I tried to reinstall w/ same results. It's back in the box waiting for some less tech challenged user to find. This was expensive, but a lesson that trying to avoid trips up/down the stairs brings on more difficulty. I will now smile as I take those trips."
1,Never could get it to work...,"I got this a couple of weeks ago and started plugging everything up according to the instructions. Put in the setup disc and start configuring it. Got everything configured correctly (according to the instructions) and tried to print something... nothing happened though. Spent hours on the telephone with Linksys tech support and they ended up telling me to exchange this one for another, but that one ended up doing the same thing as the first. I do not recommend this product at all to anyone!"
1,Useless as a print server,"I am an IT professional and love linksys products. However, this product needs further development. It was difficult to setup, does not work well with many printers and support could not give additional information on a list of printers or which ones they have had issues with. It is also apparent that there is a problem with multifunction printers since that was the first question that was asked on 2 different occassions."
1,CISCO Stinks and so does this print server,"This is a horrible little piece of junk. The web interface is poor and really only works well in Internet Explorer. It only works with a limited number of printers. My Canon wasn't on the list, so it doesn't work. Even when used with the right printer, it often goes offline and I have to restart it. If you put in a custom configuration (I used a static IP address), the reset button doesn't reset it to the factory settings. The worst thing that happens to me is that it sometimes loses its mind and floods the network with packets and causes my router to become disabled, similar to a Denial or Service or DDOS attack. I can't even use it as a mini hub on my network because of this.Then the power supply failed and I couldn't find another one to replace it. Contacting CISCO is useless, they won't support it or even offer any advice. What a crappy company and a crappy piece of crap!!!"
2,Unreliable,I have had this print server for approximately 6 years now. It was very easy to set up back when I had Windows XP. Now that I have Vista and I try to set up the wired print server on the last 2 computers it has been quite a hassle and loses connectivity frequently. Even when it was set up on XP I would have to reset the print server config about every 2-3 months. I will ditch this and get a wireless printer instead.
5,4 port switch,Although wireless is the way to go. I like having a hard wire setup. This small compact out of the box ready switch is ideal for sharing between computers and printers. Only draw back is an on-off switch. I run XP and this fits the bill. Product in great condition and delivered on time.
2,Not recommended,"This product is relatively easy to install and works great for awhile, but it doesn't hold up very well. I've purchased two in the past several years, and in my experience, this print server tends to stop working shortly after the warranty expires. For this reason, I won't be buying another Linksys PSUS4 again and cannot recommend this product to others."
2,Not up to usual Linsys standards,"In several attempts, I could not make this device print. A little later, the integrated 10/100 switch failed. I'm a Linksys fan (many of their devices in my network), so I bought same unit as a replacement. Hmmm, this one was dead out of the box too (couldn't even configure it).Linksys tech support was very friendly, but offered only stuff I already knew & concluded the unit was defective. What are the odds?I have two other print servers (not Linksys) working on a network with Linksys router, switches & WAPs; I'm certainly not a tech newbie.Linksys is having some serious technical problems with this product. It tarnishes their otherwise glittering reputation for solid, value-priced SOHO network gear. I recommend staying away from this particular product."
2,Couldn't Get It To Work,"I am an IT technician, I followed (most of) the instructions for setup, and couldn't get it to work with my LinkSys router. Then I reset everything and started again, following the instructions exactly, and still couldn't get it to work. Then I called Tech Support, who were very nice and walked me through reseting various things and doing everything again, and it still wouldn't work. Eventually, they came to the conclusion that the unit was faulty.So, I don't really know how well it works, because it didn't for me. Assuming you get a working unit, it may be fine. But I just gave up and sent it back.I have a Linysys Wireless router that works great, and their tech support was actually helpful - so that's why it gets at least two stars."
1,Don't buy the PSUS4,"I've a PSUS4 for over two years now. I'm awaiting the return of a forth replacement unit from Linksys. They stream my LAN and kill connections. Linksys tried to claim the warranty was one year even though the .PDF on their web site states three years. When I cross shipped the last return, they charged my credit card early and then took forever to refund the money. Now, they claim the unit is on back order for over six weeks already. This is the last Linksys component in my LAN. I've replaced every other device with other brands. Linksys stinks!"
1,Defective out of the box,"I can't say I wasn't warned, as I had to dig behind 11 returned PSUS4's at my local Fry's to find the one that was factory fresh. After installation, the setup software was able to find the print server on wireless networked computers, but not on wired, even when configured and plugged directly into the PSUS4. I was able to configure the PSUS4 wireless, but was not able to print. It turns out the PSUS4 is not compatible with my HP G85xi. Before throwing it out, I gave it to my IT guy, who had the same problems, and couldn't get it to work on any of his 3 printers. I purchased a Linksys EPSX3 (Parallel print server), setup was a breeze, and within an hour I had 3 computers printing on 2 printers.My recommendation is to throw a dart and pick any other print server than this."
1,Be wary!!! - Major incompatibility issues,This print server is not compatible with my Cannon i860 printer. The Linksys supoort group was pretty much non-supportive after they revealed that my printer is not compatible. In general this print server won't work with multi-functional printers. SO MUCH FOR A PRINT SERVER THAT JUST WON'T SERVE A PRINTER - ironical! No do you really want to buy Linksys?
1,"Works as a switch, but flakey as a PrintServer","As others have noted, this little gem will NOT work with multi-function printers. I could not get it to acknowledge the presence of a Dell 720 Photo Printer either. It did work for a short time with a Canon 4100, but lost connectivity and hasn't worked since the second day of use. I have purchased seven Linksys devices for my network, Hubs, Routers, Switches, Print servers. This is the third device that has either not worked at all or quit working within a week of installation. No more Linksys for the network, something, anything else has to be better."
1,2 Problems: (1) Broke after a month & (2) too hard to use with Mac,"No matter what the packaging says, the PSUS4 is designed for PCs. I never could get the print server to work in a LAN with Macs. My Internet search suggests that no one else can either.So I used it as a 4-port router. That worked okay for a month then the device failed completely. Linksys tech support suggested returning it to the company for a refund. I requested a merchandize return number a week ago. I am still waiting.Unfortunately, I bought the device from Staples. It does not take returns on ""technology products"" after 14 days. I learned my lesson: buy from Amazon. They have a 30-day return policy.Fred"
1,POS- Doesn't work,"This thing is a piece of s...It just doesn't work. Needs to be rebooted all the time. Hangs, won't connect to a Laserjet 3004, goes into error mode Avoid it at all costs."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Run from Linksys - this product is garbage and as stated in other reviews not compatible with some HP printers. It took me 3 hours on the phone and tech service was completely unhelpful before they told me it was the printer - complete BS - to boot, product documentation in the box is practically non-existent and the website is no help either.Encountered similar problems with other Linksys offerings - will never buy this brand again."
1,"DON""T BUY",Item needed to be more specific. Item had piece moving in it and was not compatiable with my Lexmark. User refused to refund my money and let me return product. I had to pay a professional to come hook it up because I could not figure it out just to find out it wasnt compatable. I have received no commet from the buy after send info about wanting to return product.
4,Works well right out of the box,"I've been using this for about two months now (edit: six months now!) and it is great to be able to print from anywhere in the house. It was easy to set up and I have it running with an ancient HP Laserjet 1160. While I don't need the extra LAN ports it is nice to have them in case I want to add network storage later.The print server has continued to work even after hard and soft ""reboots"" of the network. No reconfiguration was necessary. Edit: survived the great power outage of 2008 and came back immediately with no reconfiguration necessary.Note: this product does not work with Mac OS-X 10.5 (Tiger).I'd give it five stars if it was a little bit cheaper."
1,Worthless paper weight,"This product never worked and I sent it back for a refund. I'm not an expert at computers or networking, but am pretty good and can read the directions. Product never worked as advertised."
1,it`s junk!,"It would not work with my printer,Now I`m out sixty dollars.I get the run around to get a refund or get credit for it. Not happy with it!!!"
2,Useless for me,"I am normally a big proponent of Linksys products. This isn't one of them. It's very selective on the printers that it will print to, and there's no list anywhere, including from Linksys, on what printers will work and what printers won't. I'm an IT person by profession, and this product was useless to me. Linksys tech support was no help other than confirming that it won't work with many printers."
2,Not Compatible with Brother HL 1440,"After spending over an hour with Linksys tech support, I was told that this Print Server was not compatible with my printer (Brother HL 1440). I give it 2 stars only because I have enjoyed success with other Linksys products. Good luck with yours!"
3,Works but with limits,"Good: I followed the instructions and set this unit up on four computers without problems. Now everyone can print without the printer being hooked up to one computer that has to be on. The unit performs as expected.Bad: I found out the hard way that this print server will not allow full functionality of a multi-function printer, specifically; it will not allow scanning. This can be worked around by unplugging the usb to the print server and connecting it directly to a computer. But the most annoying aspect of all this is that this little ""limitation"" is not mentioned anywhere in the setup manual or in information that I could find on the linksys website. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Bad Print Server,"Bad, bad, bad.1. Windows only.2. Doesn't seem to work with our Epson multi-function printer.3. Even in windows, It just doesn't work."
2,Pretty easy - *updated* -,"We have DSL + wired & wireless router + VOIP, and added the Linksys PSUS4 print server to the mix. Our printer is an HP PSC 1100, an inexpensive multifunction printer. The HP site and Linksys sites did not specifically name this one as compatible but we tried it anyway.Setup was pretty easy & fast for the family computer professional and the print server performance has been reliable. Setup would have taken longer for the other family members, and not been as easy, as they would have had to read the instructions and figure out how to add the router to the existing configuration, so not quite five stars on this one.Dec 2010, the print server has failed :-/ I had expected more than 3 years out of it. Reduced from 4 stars to 2, due to this reliability issue."
2,Technology not up to date,I wanted to stay with Linksys and the 4 ports would have been a perfect fit but unfortunately I had to return mine. The USB port is not compatible with a lot of HP printers. (HP 1022 in my case) Linksys could not troubleshoot the problem and had nothing in their system about my HP printer. Hard to believe when random consumer comments in amazon have better info than a manufacturers knowledge base. I wonder if they know who HP is? HP eventually helped confirm Linksys needed to update this product. Better go with another brand. The replacement 1 port IOGEAR was a little harder to set up due to a fixed IP need but it is doing the job.
2,Works but often needs to be reset,I have been using the PSUS4 for about a year. It often gets locked up (The printsever not the ethernet part). I have to remove power for a short time to reset it. I'm using an HP 970cxi printer
1,Linksys PSUS4 does not work with Lexmark 3150,"Spent 60 minutes with the Linksys support group, to have them finally say, nicely, ""sir, this printer is not on the list of printers that work - nor is it on the list of printers that don't work. i suggest you return the print server and try another brand."" Very frustrating and it appeared like the support person was not that good to boot, so at this point I don't know if it won't work with the Lexmark 3150 or if the support person is just not capable. In any case, I'll take it back."
1,Dont Buy It,Does not work with HP7350 Inkjets. Tech support will tell you to return it. From other posts seems to have problems with USB printers.
1,Great when it works,"I've been using this Linksys print server for over two years now at one location with pretty good results. It installed initially on two computers with no problems. When I added another last month, however, I couldn't get it working for several hours and then suddenly it worked - not sure why. Linksys support wasn't of much help.Then today I went to install another PSUS4 at a new location. The setup went smoothly and the port was all set up correctly, but I kept getting error messages when trying to print to my LaserJet 1000. A 15-minute call to Linksys support revealed that I have a bad unit. Unfortunately I purchased this over a year ago (I just opened the box however), so the warranty is expired. VERY disappointed with Linksys. I've always been a fan before, but this $70 lesson will stay with me a long time. I don't want to replace this printer with a network unit so I'll get another print server - I'll just stay away from Linksys."
1,Save yourself the anguish,"This little device is a miserable excuse for a print server. No support for multi-function printers, limited support for other printers, and lousy software. The admin tool has some of the worst, least intuitive user interface screens I've ever seen. The installer for the downloaded software doesn't work. Shall I continue? Nah... don't think I'll waste any more of my time. And for your own mental health, don't buy this product and waste your time (or money) either!"
5,Fascinating creatures!!,"What vivid, bright colors these birds have! This video is so clear and bright, you almost feel like you're there in person. I've fed hummingbirds at my feeders but never saw them like they're portrayed here. Usually they flit about so quickly and if they do sit, it's too brief but with this video, you can see so much detail to them and actually learn about them as living little creatures, not just blurs of color in the air. Absolutely fascinating!"
5,Zakour and Ganem do it again,"A fun bit of fiction. I've read their previous two Zach books and they were also good, but this one tops the previous stories. Lots of great ideas in here, but it's sadly over too soon. I see there's another newer book out by Zakour and I'm very much looking forward to reading it. If the new one is anything like this book, then I'll be very satisfied."
2,Disappointing...,"I had pre-ordered this book in in Jan 05 because I adored the previous titles, Plutonium Blonde and Doomsday Brunette. This installment in the series, however, lacks the humor and character development of the other two novels. It consists mainly of cynical one-liners, and the plot is superficial and grim. Although I agree with the political commentary on the media and pop culture that the authors make in the book, they compromised the humor and science fiction aspects that made the other two books so wonderful. It is almost as though they are trying to meld a number of genres and the result is confusing and incomplete: science fiction, noir, gay/lesbian, political commentary, self-help, martial arts, pop culture, and last, but unfortunately least, humor.Based on the ending of the book, I imagine this is the last one they will write in this series."
3,It IS a brush,"It is a brush, and it does fit in the dryer tube... I don't think the handle is long enough, or bendy enough."
2,Great for kids to enjoy but not those who like 60s music....,"Some types of megamix albums using uncredited vocalists are pretty good - Jive Bunny and the Master Mixers forged a career out of doing just that - whereas there's times when the results are pretty terrible. This is one such album. The line-up of songs used is quite impressive, but when you learn for yourself these are not the original artists, you soon discover what a mediocre album this actually is. Fans of 60s music will probably dislike ""Sixties Mix Volume 1"", but kids - or those first showing signs of being interested in such music - will probably find this fascinating. Even so, do yourselves a favour and check out those 60s compilation albums that use the *original* artists. This is one example where the original versions are better.Jon."
2,A significant change of genre,"Resident Evil Damnation is an action/adventure techno-thriller, which is great if your into that sort of thing. Having just replayed Resident 1, 2, and 3 this year, I find this CGI movie at odds with the franchise's dark, brooding gothic origins. In Damnation, no one is conserving ammo or running for their lives or using stealth. Instead, the bright sunlit movie is loud, brazen, and in your face with an unlimited cache of weapons and ammo. As a horror fan that was expecting survival horror, I was not happy. I feel Capcom is selling out simply to keep the franchise alive and fresh. It's time to retire RE with dignity."
1,Resident Evil Damnation,I don't like renting cartoons. Upon seeing my mistake I passed on the movie and found another movie to rent.
1,They Aimed at the Best CGI... Unfortunately!,"Having been a Resident Evil fan from pretty much the beginning, I've followed the ups and downs of both the games and the films. This film is another in an increasing number that emphasize CGI and special effects etc. over story and storyline. In fact the filmakers are prepared to sacrifice better story elements from the Resident Evil series storyline just to present their technological CGI expertise. The filmakers appear to have the attitude that only their vision of film making is important and the fans of Resident Evil along with the all of the rest of the audience be damned. The film makers take their technological work so seriously that even the gag reel in the dvd extras was not funny.A very boring and disappointing film."
1,This movie really sucked,"My girlfriend just had to see this movie. I rarely see her disapointed in something we watch, but this one really sucked."
1,the story line is very VERY!!!!! boring,the story line is very VERY!!!!! boring you will hate this movie bigtime im a fan and the only thing thats good is when the lickers fight the tyraunt
3,mostly computer generated and not usual actors,"This is not what I thought it would be - another movie with the same actors especially Milla Jovovich which could not ever be replaced in this series plus it has computer generated scenes and actors. The movie was boring in comparison to the others and what I really wanted was retribution which was a result of my stupidity. #1- I should have known what the name of Milla new film was before I ordered, #2- I should have read the synopsis and who were the actors, and # 3- I should have have know when the cover said original CG motion picture that cg mean't computer generated."
2,not recommended,"Weak story (even for Resident Evil standards) and the animation was not up to current standards. Only bother with this if you are a huge RE fan and really, really need a new fix."
4,Cool story,I like all the Resident Evil media including the Movie series this is a good watch.If your a fan also go for it.
4,Damnation,This story is fun from beginning to end and I recommend this to those who enjoy yelling for the good guys.
4,Great Recap of the RE 6!!,"Yet again another wonderful CGI anime to continue the Resident Evil storyline!! Clean animation and good English dubbing. I would suggest watching this movie between Resident Evil Extinction and Resident Evil Retribution, ESPECIALLY if you haven't stayed up to date on your gaming. It nicely fills in a few creature gaps and plot points. But other than that it's a well done movie to watch regardless!!"
4,Another excellent installment in the Resident Evil saga,"While not a huge fan of the live action Resident Evil movies, the computer animated movies continue to show more depth and storytelling capabilities than many live action movies. Excellent technical quality, and a good storyline. Worth watching."
4,game feel movie,It has an interesting story with a lot of action. Would of liked to see s bit morr comedy and romance in the movie like leon and ada.
4,Felt like Filler.,"It was a really decent film, but It just feels so incomplete. But it's still good. I highly recommend it!"
4,Hi-Def Horror,"The animation on this movie is visually some of the best I have ever seen. The story is great and involves fan favorite Ada Wong in a cool core plot role. If your a fan of the resident evil series then get this movie, you wont be disappointed."
3,Not as good as Degeneration... :(,"First of all, the introduction and the beginning of the movie is extremely slow. I nearly fell asleep. The story itself is a bit lacking as you're not given much more information on what is going on in the RE universe. There are good action sequences but again, the actual story is not what I expected. There is only one new snippet of information about the bioweapon and the rest is just nonsensical politics.The voice acting is on par with Degen etc... but I just didn't like the story despite the good action scenes. Perhaps I expected too much as an RE fan, and I'm sure if you are one you'll watch this no matter what reviews come out. Just don't keep your expectations high otherwise you might be disappointed like me."
3,Resident Evil: Damnation,"I put off watching this at first because I prefer the live action movies to featurettes. When I finally sat down and watched this animated version I was truly impressed with the graphics, music, and story. This is well worth viewing, not only if you are a fan of the game, Resident Evil movies, or Science Fiction/Horror in general. Based on the movies and/or game, this feature follows intrepid US undercover agent and Umbrella agent in Russia dealing with the political turmoil escalating to a war between the government and a rebel faction. When the use of Bio Organic Weapons (BOW)s - (Umbrella Monsters), is deemed acceptable, the war gets ugly. What was the biggest surprise to me was the comedy, it had several ""quotable"" lines that I enjoyed.CA Luster"
4,One of the best Game to Movies,"I loved Degeneration and was thrilled to find out Capcom was making a sequel. The story line is very good, even better than the previous film. I only have a few complaints, The dialouge wasn't as good as what it could have been, and some of the voice overs were just plain ridiculous. The CG was great but sometimes I had felt like it could have been better (ironically I felt the same was for RE6). Overall it's an excellent movie and it's a must see for Resident Evil fans. Also, it was nice to watch it before I purchased RE6, it made me hyped for the game. :)"
1,ANAMATION...,"Resident Evil: Damnation ....... Actually, I expected this to be the next part of the Resident Evil series with Milla Jovovich. My fault :( Turned off 3min in ...... Can't stand animated movies (that's just me). I wish I could get a refund.."
1,Very bad movie.,"The CG is great and the movie is awful. Not a god story at all, really really bad.Why can't someone make a good CG movie..."
3,Another Animated Movie,"So the first animated Resident Evil movie was good, this was not quite there, but thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend this to any other Resident Evil fans!"
5,Great Movie .....,"Resident evil Damnation is one of great resident evil movies ever made , the visual are awesome and up to it limits , Leon is badass character in the movie , the storyline of the movie is good can consider as medium level.the movie have it thriller moments ,it can consider as medium horror movie in this part it is much more better than the game as it is turned and action base game.any way if you are a RE fan you will love this movie, and wish they do more frequently not every 2-3 years."
4,Worth a rent if you're a fan,"There's a nice trailer to RE6 in the credits. The story line is decent but failed to execute in a few areas, like the young soldier kid who carried a flask, his youth just didn't translate well to CGI, I don't know why but it just seemed off. The rest of the characters worked well. One of these days they'll get to Beowolf level production and these movies will really shine. It's better than degeneration, lots of neat action, some real innovative camera work with the lickers and even Leon's ""gun cam"", the red dot looked good. I wish it was a little shorter but over all I'm glad I rented this and glad I didn't spend $15 to own the DVD. For what it's worth, it was enjoyable."
5,Great movie.,"For fans of RE who liked Degeneration, you should like this movie even more. The CG-I work here is better, the story is more fleshed out with better pacing, the music and action is awesome, and the side characters have their own individual backstory that you can become easily invested in.It's a great example of what fun can come of working with CG-I. (It just boggles the mind how the movies in this series have gotten better while the games have arguably gotten worse.)"
3,"It was ok, no different than the other Resident Evil Anime","This movie was ok, but it had the same feel as the other Resident Evil Anime. Nothing really new or exciting."
2,Not worth the time,"It was pretty boring really... Not much of a plot.. nothing new as far as the resident evil creepies are conserned, no crazy lake monster or anything neat. I miss the old RE with the walking dead, not thies plant a seed head pop off wigglie things. The series has taken a turn for the worse, its time to get back to bacis and get some creative ideas going."
2,Huh....,Seen other RE movies. This one was a little hard to follow. Had to watch it twice to figure out where it fit in with the other films.
4,Improved sequel,"I didn't care for the first Resident Evil CGI film ""Degeneration"". I thought it was very boring, with uninteresting new characters, and a forgettable plot.This sequel ""Damnation"" is a lot more entertaining. Way more action, and a lot of scenes feel like you're watching someone play Resident Evil! Very fun.My biggest gripe with the film is an annoying comedic character that follows Leon around. With a very, horrible, 'Russian accent'. The voice actor for this guy somehow forgot and got lost in the accent because eventually the character goes from a generic faux Russian accent to sounding like Triumph the Insult Dog from the Conan O'Brien show.Seriously, if it wasn't for that idiotic character I would have given the movie all five stars on this review."
4,fun movie,"If you two hours to kill and you are feelinn nostalgic, this is a fun movie to watch. It makes for an interesting addition to the resident evil series, as well as bringing back classic characters like the lickers and Mr. X tyrants."
3,Resident Evil Damnation,"The movie is in the same vain as the other animated movie...and taking that into consideration, the movie was entertaining."
3,"Great CG, action-horror","You pretty much know what you're going to get when you sit down to watch Damnation - that is, if you're a fan of the franchise. Like earlier CG offerings, the tech is good and the action is jam packed. You're not going to have your life transformed by this movie but you WILL enjoy yourself for the duration...if horrific mutation and the questionably undead are your idea of enjoyment! And really, what's not to enjoy?"
5,REAL Resident Evil movie,"I enjoy the live action Resident Evil movies too, don't get me wrong. But you have to look at them as just fun movies. If you are a big fan of the RE video games as I am, these CG movies are much better, add to the real story from the games and use the same voice actors from the games. When you're watching Claire or Leon, you are watching the same characters from the games, not some live actor's interpretation of the character. And it's (almost) always disappointing when, for example, the live actor of Claire Redfield is just not like the Claire from the games, in looks or mannerisms."
1,useless,"This really is not worth buying, I cannot believe it got published! It could have been written on 2 pages."
1,Self indulgent turn off,"This guy invented a word and thinks he's surpassed Confucious in wisdom because of it. After one and one half chapters of self congratulatory blather and promoting himself, I couldn't stand to read any further. Reminds me of talking heads on television who think they are enlightening the world by stating and restating the obvious - ad nauseum. Strictly for lightweights. I'd like to see one - just one - of this self help gurus come up with an idea thats at least a week or two newer than those in the ""Upanishads""."
3,"Beautiful book, but only skin deep","The best reason I can think to recommend this book is that it is indeed a physically beautiful book. I loved the purple cloth-lined covers, the gorgeous illustrations, even the typeface. It had the feel of a book from 100 years ago.Unfortunately, I found the content to be somewhat superficial, and all the sidebars got distracting after a while. I wanted more details, especially on the uses of opium by writers and other artists, and some idea whether the use of opium enhanced or inhibited creativity. The writing style itself had the feel of a term paper, albeit a term paper on a college level. I'd give the book five stars for looks, but only 2-1/2 stars for content. Since I weigh content more heavily than looks, then I have to give this one three stars."
4,"Sometimes life can hurt, but we wouldn't miss it!","Very rarely do I ever read a fictionalized version of an event in a person's life and love it. Joe Matlock's 'The Dance' is one of those rare times.Toby and Sharon came from two different life-styles, but they built a bridge and met in the middle to forge a love that lasts into eternity.Filled with romance and adventure 'The Dance' will make you sigh, make you laugh, make you cry and make you beg for more of Mr. Matlock's wonderful talent"
2,Mythology and poetic descriptions,"This book suffers greatly from the text - poetic descriptions of the images ('...notice there are white gossamer snow flake patterns with jewel-like rays over a greenish background...') (my paraphrase) are annoying - the images are there to see for ourselves. Extensive mythological backgrounds for the names (of which there are a very large number) of every moon, every crater, every mountain ('...W who is the son of the god of X and married the goddess of fate Z and then killed Z's father after he...') (paraphrase) are usually as long as the accounts of scientific facts. A three paragraph blurb will have one of mythology, one of poetic description, and one will be informative. Buy this book for the pictures."
2,Look Further...,Say your time (and money) and buy Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes by Michael Benson which covers the same ground and more.
4,Wonderful book!,"A friend gave me a copy of The Moons of Jupiter as a gift. I have never been an astronomy buff, but now I am. The images in this book were like visiting strange new worlds. Io with its dramatic volcanoes; Europa with its frozen ice fields, covering water which may harbor life outside of the earth; Gayemede with its strange geology; and Callisto, pock-marked with meteor impacts. I particularly liked the last section of the book with its catalogue of all the minor outer satellites. The writing, too, was a big surprise. Rather than the dry technical exposition I expected, the accounts of different moons were filled with allusions to mythology, literature, art and history as well as informative science. This is a beautiful book which I highly recommend. Four stars for sure!--bh"
2,Dead on arrival,"I got a great price for this internal Blu-ray drive, however it has caused me much work. I initially installed it in a brand new Vista PC. Although Vista recognized it, it wouldn't even play an audio CD. OK, I reinstalled it into another PC with Win XP. Guess what? Windows recognized it, but it would not play any CD, DVD or Blu-ray. I called the manufacturer's tech support and they said to send it back to Amazon. They highly discouraged me from returning it to them. I got my money back and bought an LG Blu-ray drive from another vendor and have been pleased with its performance. I rated this with two stars because of its low price when I purchased it. The price is considerably higher now because it is being sold by a third party vendor instead of Amazon."
2,don't be fooled by its title,I had higher hopes for this CD and have been disappointed. There are only 2 relaxation tracks on it. The first one isn't bad though it would have been better if there were more birth affirmations and something to prepare you for a positive labour experience. But the 2nd track is just appalling. In fact the background music has the opposite effect from relaxation and left me feeling anxious. I even had my husband try this CD and he said it got on his nerves and made him more tense after just 5 minutes!
2,Not worth it!,"I found that the entire CD is filled with instructions on how to breathe. ""Breathe in and out, breathe in and out!"" Then it will say, ""now think about your baby""! Thats it! I was very disappointed."
2,be careful with ur money,"some movies worked fine (looked terrible but hey good ol kung fu cheesiness u cant deny) and some movies didnt work correctly at all. i bought this brand new. the only thing i can guess is the movies were burned onto some very cheap quality dvds. i only spent 5$, but still im disappointed. oh and i like the cover, esp how bruce is in like 1 movie and his clones star in the others. i wasnt expecting much for 5$, but when its barely playable, then we have some issues."
2,Doesn't compare to The Three Junes....,I ADORED The Three Junes and was eagerly waiting for another novel from Ms. Glass but only got halfway through this book. I wanted to keep reading because I still think the author is extremely talented but unfortunately it just didn't capture my interest. Main problems:A. I didn't find Greenie a very interesting or sympathetic character.B. Story lumbers along very slowly.C. I could sense the author WRITING the book as I was reading it which makes it very hard to immerse yourself in the story.D. There are many different story lines in The Whole World Over and everytime I picked up the book it felt like I was reading a completely different novel -- this disjointed sensation never allowed me to get close to the characters or to enter their world.I hate to write a bad review because I still think Ms. Glass is a brilliant writer. I highly recommend her first book which was utterly gorgeous and truly magical.
2,Disappointing,"Like other reviewers, I really loved Three Junes, and the decision to buy this book was an easy one. So, it was disappointing to finish it and feel like I had wasted my precious reading time. There were some memorable characters, but in the end, the main character (Greenie) came off very flat and unsympathetic. Without trying to give away the plot, her motivations, actions and reactions seemed trite to me, and as I approached the end of the book, I found myself wishing her husband would dump her!"
3,so disappointed,"I thought ""Three Junes"" was a wonderful book and I expected to like this one as much. Sadly, I could not stick with it. I rarely abandon a book and I finally just put this one away. Julia Glass is a great writer, but I found this book oddly uninvolving. while I liked many of the characters, they did not really hold my interest. I was not all that concerned about what happened to them and I could easily guess just about every turn of the plot. I felt like reading this book was a chore. An assignment that I did not want to complete. Again, it breaks my heart to have to say this, but this book is really a huge disappointment."
4,Enjoyable read,"I just stumbled upon this book and found it to be a very enjoyable one. I liked the characters, the settings, the stories woven through the story and looked up the author to find other books that she has written.After reading the lukewarm reviews of those who had first read her previous book (Three Junes, I believe), I am glad that I hadn't yet, and I look forward to reading it now."
4,The National Book Award Winner does it Again,The author of The Three Junes proves again why she is a winner of the National Book Award
5,the order,I ordered two copies of each of Julia Glass' books. Once again I received only one copy of each of these books. These were all gifts to friends as I had already read them and enjoyed them. So I had to order one more of EACH and pay extra shipping because AMAZON got it wrong AGAIN!
2,Contrived,The book fell apart for me at the end. I was uneasy knowing that the book involved the events of 9/11 since I lived through that day. It felt to me like a literary device that the author used to tie up her characters' lives and insert political views into her book. This book was the first book that I have read by this author and I am not inclined to read another now.
2,Could put it down and never pick it back up again,"I completely agree with the reader below who stopped midway through this tedious, uninvolving novel. I'm at page 200 and could really not care less about any of the characters. Nothing in this writing feels authentic -- not place, not voice, not narration, which is written in an irritatingly perky tone. I didn't much care for ""Three Junes"" either. An extremely overrated author at work here. (And by the way, I'm curious about the reviewer Harriet Klausner below, named the ""#1 Reviewer"" and who has, apparently, written over 11,000 reviews on these pages. Must you love every single book you read to become Amazon's top reviewer? Something suspicious afoot.)"
2,A waste of my time,I persevered and finished this book but it was much too long. I tired of the child's dialog and the food descriptions. Queenie was a very unsympathetic character and the characters' reactions to situations just didn't ring true for me. I gave it 2 stars just because she seems to be an excellent writer.
2,I finally just gave up,"After reading 278 pages which is just about half way through the book, I did have to give it up. I could never relate to any character and, as another reviewer wrote, ""every time I picked the book up, I couldn't see how we got to that page"". I suppose that before the book ends, there is surely a connection to all the characters but I can't think what it might be."
2,the whole rambling mess...,"After the hype on this book, I was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole. I kept at it, hoping it would improve but alas, dear reader it does not."
3,Would have been 4 stars except for the last 100 pages or so,"Julia Glass does an outstanding job of interweaving multiple stories throughout the book, but you never get lost or have trouble figuring out who she's talking about now. That is up until about page 400, when she threw in the Sept 11th wrench. I know that my life was significantly affected by that day, but it just didn't seem like it fit. It felt like she was writing the story, then she wanted to add that part in as an afterthought. It was just too much, too big of yet another story to try and incorporate when you only have around 100 pages left in the book. I loved her book 'Three Junes' and easily got through this book, just because her writing is so great, but I really do think she jumped on the bandwagon of trying to make a book about 9/11."
4,Good characters--not as good as her other books.,"Julia Glass usually creates wonderful characters. This book is a good read, but not as good as her other wonderful novels--Three Junes, I See You Everywhere, and the most recent, The Widower's Tale.I think the book wandered a bit, and I didn't see the motivation for some of the characters' choices. The Other Man was a cipher. But Julia Glass is a wonderful writer, and I'd hate to miss anything she writes."
2,I wanted to like it...,"The Whole World Over goes all over the place and never quite delivers much of anything. The characters are hard to keep track of and when the story leads you back to them, you've forgotten who they were.The end is extremely unsatisfying. It was as if Ms. Glass decided to hurry up and end things that she spent so long developing. We never find out what has become of a few main characters after the 9/11 tragedy. It was a lesson in frustration for me. I won't waste my time reading anything else she writes."
2,Lightening didn't strike twice,"As many of the other reviewers have written, this book is no ""Three Junes."" While, I found it to be an enjoyable enough read and some of the characters were engaging, ultimately, it seemed to lack heft and significance. There were simply too many characters and too many stories to follow. And some of the characters (Walter) were walking stereotypes. One of my biggest complaints about the book is with Glass's writing of dialogue. Glass tries so hard to have a different voice for each character that sometimes she goes to far, like the cheesy ""western"" style of the New Mexico Governor. Even more troubling, Glass writes dialogue for at least two African-American characters in a way that is borderline offensive."
2,Disappointed,"I had high expectations for this book and was so disappointed. If I hadn't committed to read it for a book club, I never would have finished it. The characters weren't engaging enough to make one care about them,the story dragged, and what's worse,the discriptions of her 'fabulous' desserts kept me wearing a path to the fridge!Based on this book, I won't bother with the next one."
3,Disappointing,"Like many others, I found this book to be a disappointment after reading its brilliant predecessor. The writing in some cases appeared to be disjointed -- the characters weak -- the storyline, preditable."
4,A good old fashioned western,"Stewart Granger and Rhonda Fleming in a good, old fashioned western. The hero is misunderstood, a gunfighter trying to give up his guns, but he still gets the girl. What's not to like."
1,Worse than spaghetti Western,This is undoubtedly a terrible movie but I purchased it because it was filmed outside the small town where I grew up. I was in high school at the time and all the movie stars stayed in town and it was quite exciting. The scenery is familiar and brings back memories. That is why I purchased the film.
2,No red light cover,Nice light but wanted for highway night driving and was really looking forward to having the red cover and there isn't one.
1,False Marketing and Corrupted Game Files,"The package doesn't say anything about having to boot up off an included disc to use untill you open it up. And if it wasn't bad enough having to boot up off a seperate disc everytime you wanted to use the card the first time I used it I compressed all my unused games onto the Max card and then tried to delete them off my old card... not only did delete my entire card instead of just the files I copied the card is no longer recognizable by the PS2 system or any games I have. It still shows up when I use the MAX OS disc, but none of the files are accessable by the games that use them.Shortly after that all the files coppied over became corrupted, so now all of my saved files are gone. I'm not sure if I received a faulty card but I am very dissatisfied either way."
5,Awesome Educational Puzzles,These are great puzzles for helping kids learn their shapes and learn how to put puzzles together. There are several 2 and 3 piece puzzles in the bucket and each shows pictures of things that are the same shape as the puzzles. The bucket is great for storage and transportation.
3,Would like it better if the pieces fit a little tighter,"My biggest complaint is that the pieces don't fit together snuggly. This might not be much of a problem if you are playing with them on a hard surface such as a tile or hardwood floor or a table, but when we play on our carpeted living room floor, the pieces don't fit together well.My 1-year-old doesn't quite grasp the concept of putting the pieces together, but does notice like colors and picks up the yellow pieces one in each hand.I like the product; I think developmentally it will help; but I think a better job could have been done to click the pieces together more firmly."
5,hungry?,"this is a fabulous book! it does much to unpack all the myths surrounding eating disorders, namely that they are a problem of rich, white, teenage women who are just overly vain. primarily it explores eating disorders in the context of race and class and as a reaction to sexual/physical/emotional abuse. rather than pathologizing the people who suffer from eating disorders, the author considers them as logical reactions to completely illogical, destructive situations. having heard all my life that my bizarre relationship with food exists because i'm crazy (rather than because i'm perfectly sane), this book did so much to assuage my guilt and shame and removed so much of the mystery that surrounded all of it. a truly transformative book ....."
5,culinary murder,"Not only is this a great murder mystery, but you get to learn something as well. The book, in the course of the murder investigation goes into the history and the making of sourdough bread. This is one of Julie Smith better mysteries."
5,WOW! Amazon's dealer come through with 5 stars!,The sourdough mixes are fantastic! Smell great while waiting for it so I can bake my sourdough bread; waffles and chocolate cake. We are in sourdough Heaven! Thank you for your prompt service.
2,Tasty read,Lots of twists and turns. Made me want lots of loaves of sour dough bread. A quick read for a cold day.
4,Sourdough yum,This is a fast-paced good read. Couldn't put it down. Surprise ending will not be what you expect. Totally enjoyable.
3,I was excited by the title,"As a true foodie, and reader, I was excited by the title and prologue to ""The Sourdough Wars"", but I got bogged down after the first two chapters. The writing is good, and I am going to give it another try later."
5,sourdough wars,love it love it love it it was funny food and compettion and the wars of bread making and love
3,Too Slow,"The book was okay. Enjoyed info regarding San Francisco as I am from there; however, the story was a bit slow and predictable."
4,Any mystery book involving sourdough bread has to be good.,"This is a great read and my first book by Julie Smith. I especially enjoyed the quirky humor and attitude that was worked into the lead character.Spun around the requisite murders in mystery stories, the flavor of San Francisco is very present. Not only do I now want to go back to visit the city again, I want to look up and read some more of Smith's work."
3,"It is a model, not a toy - stars from toy only viewpoint","This is a great model, they even tell you an age range, Model details are great but it will not stand up to play from a younger kid. It is all metal and quality built. Though the size is listed it seemed smaller that we expected when we got it. Overall it is a great working model of the truck but buying at as a toy for a younger kid would not be recommended."
5,Great replica!,This is a great toy for my son. I gave him this toy for Christmas. He loves it so much.
4,Christmas Gift,Bought as gift for my son because it was on his wish list. He and his wife enjoy the show and Nathan Fillion.
5,Castle 3,Nathan Fillion gets better and better. Stana Katic is just lovely. I so enjoy the chemistry between then and the secret love!
5,I have fallen in love with this series,"I was looking for a new series to watch and I stared with the first episode of Season One. I've now caught up to the current episode of Season 5...... in about 2 weeks.While I am doing financial busywork, it is wonderful to have this very interesting series to keep me entertained."
5,Castle is a wonderful show. I just live it.,"I just started watching Castle this summer and had to buy all the seasons. I absolutely love the show. I think the chemistry between Stana (Kate) and Nathon (Castle) Is just amazing. It seems so natural. Every episode grabs me and always has me thinking. I just love the show. I would recommend it to anyone who loves drama, romance, suspence and much more."
5,Castle Season 3: Just what I expected!,"If you aren't already a fan of Castle, you will be when you watch seasons 1 - 3 on DVD. My family watches them over and over again. We love the humor, actors, and story lines. A must-have for any mystery/detective genre addict."
2,"Castle rocks, Video on Demand sucks!","Last year you could download amazon videos into your i tunes. This year, they are making you download their own player, which is horrible. The downloads take forever, the player doesn't work half the time, and it's one extra app on your machine you don't need. My advice is wait for the dvd or download single eps from i tunes!"
4,castle is good,"only on episode 18 and so far so good wish they would get it together them two drives me nuts but then, there would be no where else to go err, see season 5 however be swet to see that first kiss oh lala..lol"
5,Great Addition,"A great addition to your DVD library,Great bonuses, gorgeous color you will have the best time.Shipping is quick and the price is to die for.Buy it today."
5,Season 3 Castle,"I've just started watching Castle and find it is a good program. Kind of like a modern day ""Murder She Wrote""...but with a love story twist."
4,Not really a muder mystery kind of person,"Murder mysteries are just not my genre, but I do like Castle. Nathan Fillion from Firefly is a hoot and Susan Sullivan, who plays his mother, give it a light-hearted edge."
4,Castle the complete third season,Funny series to watch after a hard day at work and no camercials. Not the everyday detective stories every channel on tv has
3,Castle Season 3,"As expected, arrived on time and in excellent order. Very happy with the order and a great show for those seeking light hearted crime shows."
3,Disappointing season,"We really enjoyed Season 1 & 2. What made them enjoyable and different from all the other gruesome detective stories was the humor and banter between characters. Somewhere in Season 3, that all got lost, maybe a new writer, who knows. It became more of a series of personal danger events rather than solving crimes together. Very dark and serious (and unrealistic) and a real loss to the series. Buy Season 1 & 2 by all means, but season 3 maybe not."
3,Ok Season.....,Better than 2nd SeasonNice Stories .....BUT Terrible cheap final Episode....And the boring Love-Story that they now painfully dragInto the 4th year starts killing the Show!
1,Why no English subtitles?,"The series itself is marvellous. But I sharply criticize the DVDs of the second and now also the third series, as the subtitles are only in Spanish an French. Is this a new policy to avoid orders from Europe?"
4,Castle has left field input to the group.,"It is unique yet his input to the unit always seems logical but sometimes not so helpful. Castle's observations as a writer at almost every crime seen has a tendency to cause Beckett to automaticaly become defensive of the units observations and input as officers against writer. No conflict between the unit and Castle is ever displayed until Castle talks Beckett into a line of investigation that not only seems rational, but attainable, that is until Beckett and Castle windup in a situation which is so far to the extreme as to present harm or even death to both of them."
5,Best Cop Show Ever!!!,"Wow - just found Castle a few months ago and love it. I can't wait to finish Season 3 & 4 - so I can start in on the current season.BTW - There are four ""Nicki Heat"" books that go along with the series."
5,Season 3,Very funny with dramatic heart felt moments that can bring tears to your eyes. It's very well written and you can't help but love the characters and cast. Castle just keeps getting better.
5,Great show.,One of the best shows on television. Humor and pathos blended expertly together with great writing and wonderful actors. Great chemistry among all the cast.
5,Great package with eps and features!!,"Not only do I think that the third season of ""Castle"" is a tour-de-force, I also believe that the nicely cased DVDs offer a good deal more than one thinks. EACH disk has some type of Bonus Features, and the fifth one has the most. I won't add anything about the series quality, because I'm sure you, the reader of this review, already know how good it is. Let's just say that it's very well done, with subtitles in various languages, close-captioning and English soundtrack. The video quality is quite satisfactory, and so are the extras (like deleted scenes and bloopers, besides featurettes and commentaries). In short, it's worth buying."
5,Great People to Buy From,"They are great to order from, and have reasonable prices. I'll use them again. I suggest you use this place if you want a good deal."
5,Love the show,I really love this show I love the chemistry between Castle and Becket. I hope it continues! Keep it on!
5,Castle,You can never go wrong with Castle!! Had the 3rd and 4th season pre-ordered on Amazon and got both quickly and the price was great.
4,Come on!,I love the show and that is why I ordered it to catch up on what I have missed. But for me he is not the show she is!
3,"DVDs in perfect condition, case not so much.","The DVDs were in perfect condition, but the case was a little worn. The prongs that hold the DVDs in place are non-existent so the DVDs fall out. I guess I'll just be really careful opening the case so the discs don't get damaged in the future. Other than that, I love having another fabulous season of this show!"
2,Missing Episodes,"I was very disappointed to see that disc #5 has only 2 episodes instead of the four it should have. These were pivotal stories in the series. i.e. The death of Beckett's boss, Montgomery, in a shootout and the shooting in the heart of Beckett and Castles'telling her he loved her. I love this show and thought I was buying the ""Complete"" series."
1,not a good product,Makes a big annoying hum that is very distracting - I rarely use it and wish I had not bought it.
5,A Heartwrenching Journey,"Very seldom do I feel such emotion when reading a book. From peaceful joy to deep anguish, I felt everything the characters did. It's a hard read, but one that makes readers examine their own heart. While I enjoy a book that ends in a neatly wrapped package, real life doesn't always work that way. The true story of Jacob, Leah and Rachel didn't either. Mrs. Higgs has used her God-given talent to bring us an updated version of the bible story and it's amazing to me how she was able to do that. The only problem I have is that I now have to wait nearly a year for the conclusion!"
4,Great reading,Felt story was well presented with love and understanding of characters.The settings were well described and the feeling of being there was strong.
5,Incredible Sequel!,"I just finished this book. Actually I put it down about 10 hankies ago. Having read ""Thorn In My Heart"" I couldn't wait to discover just exactly how Liz was going to wrap up the Bible story in Scottish cultural detail and make it ring true. She did a masterful job, I think. I enjoyed ""Thorn In My Heart"", but I loved ""Fair Is the Rose"", and am thoroughly convinced that the conclusion will be a God-honoring effort to relate His message of love and forgiveness, and help us to see how He has worked with, and walked with, His people throughout the ages. Yes, I hurt for Leana. But I also envied her peace, as costly as it was. Happy endings? Who knows? This story is not ended."
1,Rose turned into a Weed...,"After reading the first book ""Thorn in my Heart"", I was so excited to read the rest of the series. I was so sickened by Rose from the first chapter. Her character was terribly self-serving and horrid. I was disgusted by the end of the book with her. I have never felt so strongly about a fictional character before! I found myself sobbing for Leana during her trials. I was very tempted to put the book aside, as it was making me feel such emotions. I am in total agreement with other reviewers who had negative feelings towards Rose. Although she did try to better herself, she continuously made herself out to be a poor, pathetic victim. ICK!! The book in itself was very well written, but I felt myself just wanting the story to end already. There was just entirely too much suffering for Leana in this book."
2,The Characters Were Off,"In the Bible, Leah was tricked into sleeping with Jacob by her father, so that he could keep Jacob around to work the flocks for another seven years. Jacob NEVER loved her, there is never any mention of that in the Bible, just that she was the mother to many of his sons. Of course, there was probably a bit of love there, but it was never like his love for Rachel, he loved Rachel the MOST and it was made so clear in the Bible about that. But in this book, he is always declaring his love for Leana, and it makes it seem like he no longer loves Rose. I wanted Rose to just give him up all throughout the book, because she deserved someone SO MUCH BETTER than Jamie...He is a disappointing character in this book, and no one, not even Leana, has a heart! These most recent two books, ""Fair is the Rose"" and ""Whence Came a Prince"" were just not as good as the first one was. I hope that the final book in the series is better than both of these have been."
4,Very Insightful,"I learned a lot from this paper. Gets a little ""academic"" in places, but I defitely learned more about President Jackson. Very Insightful"
3,Interesting,A very enlightening view of President Jackson. Insightful and interesting to read. Truthful and pulls no punches about his irascibility and love for his wife and a good fight.
3,Is Ok,Wasn't my choice to buy this. Needed it for a class assignment. Was cheaper to buy than to try to track down on an inter-library loan. A bit dated but good background if anybody needs a primer on Christian counseling.
5,A Mandatory Manual For Preparedness in Any Emergency,"This brilliantly-written bible of preparedness is a must for every family. It is written with heart and love for her fellow man, wanting everyone to be ready for possible emergencies.Raymond Aaron"
5,Practical advice provides parents with peace-of-mind!,"Reading this book was a pleasure! The thoughtful, practical advice was very well presented. I most appreciated the way the author didn't sensationalize or raise any undue panic about the pending Y2K situation ... just common-sense, down-to-earth suggestions on what to do as a parent to be sure that your family is reasonably prepared to cope in the event of any serious problems which might arise. I would highly recommend that this book be in every home."
1,wasted $32...,"my favorite book became a dull movie....and I wasted $32 on this....the only twoparts that I liked: the interview with directorand the 9 blind sadhus singing.....rent it, do not buy it...."
1,Sad and Offensive,"As a Buddhist and a fan of the book this film not only offended me as a follower of the Buddha but as a fan of Mr. Hesse's novel. This film has nothing in common with the reality of either. The sound is not very good either. If this film were made of the story of Christ with the same liberty, the filmmaker would have been dragged through the streets. Fortunately, Buddhists just sigh and turn away."
1,am searching for the REAL BUDDHA Film,"hi.. I watched Buddha film when i was a kid- I still remember the scene when he was born & get to walk on the ""Lotus"" Leaf as well as his meditation under the tree when he get enlightment & the ""Huge REAL cobra"" that came at the top of his head (as an umbrella against rain)--Am searching for that film- this Siddhartha has nothing to do with the REAL ONE-Pls- if anyone know the REAL film TITLE- then let me know-Thanks"
1,Nowhere near as good as the book.,"I would like to reiterate a few points that I've seen in other reviews but I don't think were stressed enough. You should know this before you consider buying the dvd:1. The acting is horrible. horrible.2. The film was obviously low budget.3. It is over thirty years old, and it feels dated.4. The story (which was amazing as a novel) did not translate well to film. Don't waste your time on the movie."
3,Catapult fun,"My son had to make a catapult for a school project. I'm a single mom with no woodworking experience or tools. This product was EXTREMELY easy to put together, took less than an hour and my son did it himself, (he's 12). The only draw back was the strength of the material, on the second launch, the spoon portion of the mechanism broke, thank god for Gorilla glue and a c-clamp. On the third launch the cross-bar broke in half. We had to cut tongue depressors in half, drill holes, and Gorilla glue the two pieces to the broken cross-bar. We then glued the stopper bar into the cross-bar for added support. The catapult actually won a contest at school for distance, surprising for it's size. The spoon broke again and will need more repair, but it held up for the ""Medeivel Faire""Test the project thoroughly before using. You may need to switch out glue, as well as do some reinforcing. Overall, inexpensive, easy to put together, don't be surprised if you need to do additional work."
1,For Fundamentalist Christians Only,"I found this book to be profoundly unhelpful to me as a non-Christian, secular homeschooler. The author assumes that everyone who homeschools is a fundamentalist Christian. There might actually be some good advice in her book, but I couldn't find it for having to wade through biblical quotes and sermonizing about the moral superiority of Christians, etc. The real pity is that I enjoyed Field's book A Field Guide To Homeschooling in which, even though it was clear she was a Christian, religion did not overwhelm the main thrust of the book. I wanted to like this book as well, since not only did I really like the Guide (especially the wonderful resource lists), but I am also an attorney turned homeschooler like Field. Christians, especially of a more fundamentalist stripe, may well find solace in the pages of this book. My suspicion is that most others will find the advice a little thin and hard to swallow."
2,Not what I expected....,"There is nothing in the Amazon ""book description"" that suggests that this is a fundamentalist Christian book. Nothing wrong with a fundamentalist viewpoint...I just want to know ahead of time if I am buying a book that is as much about leading a Christian life as it is about homeschooling. I expected a book dealing with balancing my life as it pertains to homeschooling versus a book that covers balancing my life solely from a spiritual perspective. For some people, homeschooling and spirituality aren't the exact same thing. The description and title of the book could have been more forthcoming."
5,Inspirational,"As a young graphic designer, it is necessary to see what other artists invision and create. This book allows me not only to do that, but to go back to work feeling inspired and ready to create something new. There are excellent examples in this book of how artists are pushing the limit with the traditional business card. However, it also contains very reserved and traditional pieces that are done in a modern light. Also, it is a beautiful book to look at...clean, crisp, with information on printing style, paper, and other tools for each card."
4,"Very creative business cards, great design inspiration","Whenever I need some inspiration, I pull this or several other books like it out and see what drops of genius I can pull from it. 95% of these would not work for 95% of companies out there, but for the few forward thinking ones, you have to admire the creativity the designers had."
2,bad quality,I was disappointd in the quality and manufacture of this product sent from China. It didn't live up to its product description either.
5,A Super Family Game!,"My husband suggested we order this game to play with our two grandchildren to ""wean"" them off of TV. It is easy enough for them play and exciting enough to hold their attention. We looked at local big box stores and several toy stores and we're unable to find them. I was very pleased to find this Original UNO Card game on Amazon. The cards are large and easy to hold and have held up to the exuberant use of two young kids. I highly recommend this card game for great family time fun."
5,A classic card game for all ages,"Uno and Clue were the two games that my friends and I played constantly while we were growing up. We probably played UNO more often because it was more portable, was owned by more people and could be played by younger siblings. Uno is an entertaining and challenging game because the word cards (skip, reverse, wildcard,draw two, and the much coveted wildcard-draw 4) mean that play is constantly changing. It's similar to the game eights, but the use of colors rather than suites and the larger than normal cards make it easier for younger children to grasp. It is fun and addicting even for adults (who will also like the colors and large cards). I played it recently with my younger sister, who is eleven, her friend, and my roomates, who'd never played before. My roomates were hooked, I enjoyed it just as much as when I was in elementary school, and we were all beaten soundly by people half our age. Definitely a classic card game."
1,Before the original...maybe?,"I've never seen uno cards like these. It says original but not like the original I had before. The wild cards do not consist of all the colors of the other cards (red, blue, yellow, red)"
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!,THEY ARE FALSLY ADVERTISING A PICTURE OF THE ORIGINAL UNO CARDS WITH A PICTURE SAYING SKIP REVERSE ON THE CARDS THE ONLY THING ORIGINAL ABOUT THESE CARDS ARE THE SIZE AND WILD CARDS BUT I BOUGHT THESE BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND THE ORIGINAL IN STORE THAT SAID SKIP REVERSE DRAW 2 SO I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO WRITE IT OUT ON ALL THE SPECIAL CARDS THANK YOU AMAZON FOR ALLOWING THESE PEOPLE TO FALSLY ADVERTISE SOMETHING!!!
3,Boring,This workout was somewhat disappointing. It does target specific areas effectively but it really was not a challenge. The instructors are not motivating either as in all other Lotte Berke series.
2,Boring,"I read most of the reviews about this dvd and I was looking forward to owning one, as soon as I got it, I was all set to work out, but just looking at the instructor, the workout outfit and the music, my enthusiasm died. I did not have that feeling, you know that satisfying feeling of pain-refreshing/relief. But yea, as I already paid for it, I try to force myself to use it untill I'm able to get me another fun workout dvd."
5,the revelation,It was very inspirational. Karen Heimbuch performs a dramatic performance along with the London Symphony Orchestra. I found a profound spiritual feeling.
4,very nice but not what i expected,Its nice looking and all but its not the kind of necklace i had in mind. The necklace is open in the back and i thought it was just attached to a key ring but its not. Its also rather large. to large for my taste.
2,Under another name from other seller,Cheap material and does not support at all. Will not order again because my experience with the description of that bra was not true at all.
5,pleased,"After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to give this bra a try. As a 34G, it is very hard to find budget friendly, cute bras. When I opened the package, I wasn't thrilled with how thin the bra is, but after trying it on, I have to say it still gives me nice shape As long as I am still happy with it after a few days, I'll definitely be looking around the shop for another one :]"
1,BOO!!!,In my opinion do not waste your money.. Makes me itch and looks weird under my shirts.. not worth it to me..
3,ok,"I bought this bar a while back and sad to say after a few washes the bar upload came out, but i still have it because its a comfortable bra"
5,Awesome,"This is the best bra ever, third one I've purchased in the last year, all the exact same. They hold up under the sheer weight of a 38G and it never gives in! Never surrenders!"
4,good,"Love the look and fit. Arrived on time and in condition stated. However, the wires on these bras tend to poke out of the fabric after awhile."
3,Not enough lift,"Hi hopes but not enough lift for this 32 DDD mom of 2.Pros:Sizing was correct.Pink color is pretty and true to my monitor.Very pretty/stylishWill adjust straps to shorten for more lift.Cons:Not enough liftunlinednot the most comfortableTry this one... not as pretty, but well fitting: Barbados Demi Underwire Bra with Lace Trim"
3,Pretty Bra,This bra is very pretty but ran small. I ordered a 40C and it didn't fit right especially under my armpits causing bulging. Recommend it for slimmer women possibly who have less bodyfat under their armpits.
1,Whimsey by Lunaire Barbados Bra,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GENBQK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title I was disappointed in the fit of this bra on my body. It was clearly the wrong size, but the return policy is so complex that I decided to keep it and let it sit in the drawer. Guess this is a risk you take when ordering undergarments on-line."
5,gorgeous fit,This is one of the best investments I have made.It lifts and gives it a beautiful shape under my clothes. It is very sexy as well.
2,Whimsy Bra,"This bra was NOTHING like I thought it would be. I am returning it. From the picture I thought it was gonna be a light padded bra, Like most bras are, Instead it has no padding what so ever and I am a 38C and I can't really have a bra with no padding. It has stitching in the middle so it looks like your cold under your shirt. And if you are cold you can for sure tell. The lace was VERY itchy. I was sooo disappointed. All the other reviews made this bra sound GREAT and it turned out horrible. I can't wait to get my money back."
2,2 Marvelettes and an unknown Lady,"While I knew Wanda Young Kathy Anderson & Ann Bogan are on this Lp I was surprise to read that Gladys Horton, Georgeanna Tillman, and Juanita Cowart are also performers. These three ladies had left the group by time this Lp was realeased. It is an ok Lp not one of their best. Gladys is truly missed on this Lp.Tony--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
4,Another excellent release from G-Starr,"(4 & 1/2 starrs) If there was any justice in the music biz - or if the record-buying public had any taste - this CD would be a hit. It's one of my favorite discs of 2004 so far. Ms Starr has got it all -- winning vocals that have both strength and vulnerability, solid backing musicians, really good songs, etc. Just about the entire album is good, but I especially like the songs ""Wonderful Thing,"" ""Hey Girl"" and the title track. For a reference point only, Garrison's style falls roughly into the same category as that of two other equally fine singer-songwriters, Patty Griffin and Lucinda Williams. If you like their stuff, I bet you'll like this CD a lot too."
1,It really isn't about fashion design,"I bought this book thinking I could learn how to design clothing on the computer. Instead, there are a lot of chapters about basic computer information, which I already knew. Anyone could learn that stuff just by knowing how to turn on a computer,using a help menu or taking a class in photoshop. I was really hoping to learn about making patterns,designing clothes and then changing shapes around to make really neat clothes. Instead the book talked about saving files, making shapes, finding fashion sites and sales stuff. To me the book is very disappointing, and too expensive."
2,To much unnecessary information.,There may have been only a few of the pages of the book that were useful the rest was just extra unnecessary information. The book was in so bad shape it seemed like it was lift in the rain for a few nights.
1,Nothing new here,Seems like the book is going to really help you learn how to design while you're reading the first few chapters-but then it falls apart. First you have to go through a bunch of basic stuff-that anyone knows---and then if you know ANYTHING about computers it is is nothing more than the tutorials or help menus of different software programs.
4,Deep space ambient - Dark and Lovely,"Very little melodic structure but interesting and complex sonic textures. Not as much to my taste as David Helpling or Deuter, but still an excellent and intriguing production."
5,A nice surprise,"Bought it in a spur-of-the-moment-what-the-hec-lets-try-something-new mood. I had never heard anything by Hasse, didn't even know he existed. Well I do now, to my delight. This is a pleasant recording of very pleasant baroque chamber music, performed on period instruments. Recommend it."
5,Passover treat,"My synagogue's Passover Care Package had some of these candies in it, and WOW are they good! Americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun. Time to taste these nutty little wonders! Individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down (grins). Better than peanut brittle any day! And these are kosher for passover!"
2,No Emotional Punch,"The pretty blah story of Alice Hammond, ordinary 33-year-old SWF. Upon breaking up with her live-in actor boyfriend, Nick, Alice discovers she's pregnant. Abortion seems to be the one practical decision she can make in her messed-up life. But at the clinic she changes her mind. She accepts her situation and the baby.At the time of this decision she moves in with her aging, failing, and crotchety grandmother. It is far from a loving home. In fact when she reveals the pregnancy, Alice receives no support from anyone--except the nice ""nerdy"" guy from work, the guy who would treat her well and raise her child. But does she let him into her life? No--he's just not Nick. And when Alice does marry Nick, she discovers he's really not so great.This book left me glad to be finished with it. I developed no feelings (well, maybe anger) for the characters. When I got to the last page I thought, ""Who cares?"""
4,Loved it!,I read this book in two days and I could barely put it down. It was a good story and kept me interested. I am off to order another by her!
3,"Light, Sometimes too Light","The book could be extremely entertaining andinsightful. Sometimes excellent character development with focus onthe issue of ""disguises"" - Are we what we appear - Usually not. But at the end of the story there were too many unanswered questions - It was almost as if portions of the story were edited out. All in all, a light, entertaining summer read."
5,The absolute guide to history at the beginning of wicca!,"This book gives a realistic view on all the fuss going on in England at 1950. Valiente writes about the situation with Scire (Gerald Gardner)and Dafoe. Also she mentions Robert Cochrane, Sybil Leek, Alex Sanders and gives a great perspective on how insiders and outsiders behave at the beginning of what has become: the rebirth of La Vecchia Religione, The Old Religion. An important fact is that Tradtional Witchcraft, is not the same as Wicca! Traditionals don't have a hierarchy."
1,The square that wasn't,"This framing square was shipped in a piece of flat cardboard with no consideration to protecting it from dropping or bending. It was bent so badly that it is completely useless for any purpose. When I called the company they offered to send another one. I declined because there is no assurance they will take any steps to improve the packaging in order to protect the tool.These things are readily available at your local hardware store, although not at this low price. I recommend paying full price for one at your local hardware store. In the long run you will save time and money."
2,"This item may not be square on arrival, if packaged/shipped by Amazon.","This is a precision tool. I bought this extra thick one because I need a nice square in my work. My order arrived in a box that was so poorly packed that I wonder about it retaining a real square. And this is the item I have to measure it with. This appears to be a fine tool, but you should buy it from a source that cares about packing it properly for shipment. Simply throwing it on the bottom of an over-sized box and then wadding and winding up brown wrapping paper on top of it only ensures that when it is dropped, that it can impact right on the tip and take it a degree out of square. If you need this tool to arrive in a box that does not invite damage, buy it elsewhere."
2,When a Square isn't square,"This product came as advertised, it is indeed 3/16"" thick and nicely made. Only one problem- it's over a 16th out of square on the long end. I'm pretty sure I can true it up, but it would be a little nicer if something sold as a 'square' really was."
1,Fire Hazard,"The first time I used this hair dryer it had been going for only a few minutes when it began to overheat, smoke, and then shorted out completely. (I was using it in a standard US outlet, so there won't any special circumstances that might have caused this.) It's dead now, and I'm planning to write to the company to request a refund. I don't recommend it --in fact-- I strongly caution against purchase since this was a near fire hazard in my experience."
3,Good playing but I personal didn't like the engineering,"Masterful technique however, the album itself lacked theme and flow between the songs. Making it disjointed to listen to. More of a collection of songs rather than a coherent album. If you are a hammered dulcimmer fan I sure you will love it. If you just want iteresting background music you may be a little disappointed."
5,One of the best!!,This is one of the best ones we ever bought. We listen to it reading late into the night. We are really glad we bought it !!!!!
5,good product worth the price,"the sticker sticks well. only if you clean the keyboard and your hands first, especially our fingers which are oily. they fit well and look good. so far it hasn't torn out yet."
5,Everything i expected,Great Doom fun. I especially like the inclusion of the original and Doom2. Even if you have payed it a hundred times it was great to play it on my big screen instead of my computer.
5,Scary Violent Good Combination,"Doom 3 is a great gorey game with chainsaws shot guns etc. TheGraphics, on a scale of 1 to 10 it is 10 they are The best I have ever seen which makes it more scary and the best details like when you see the blood all over the zombies mouths it made my heart skip a beat. Sound 10 out of 10 Like when you shoot a gun you can hear the shell hit the ground and the demons and zombies you can hear them groan and their footsteps. Story 8 out of 10 you are on Mars working for Union Aerospace Corporation. Accidentally open a gateway to Hell. Limited edition is better because it has the first two doom games so if you want a scary gorey shooter buy Doom 3"
4,Doom 3 is great but...,doom 3 is awesome but is 2 easy. put it on vetran and it gets harder it allmost the same as the pc version but some parts are different. Skip the intro when you start up the game it gives away spoilers. other wise if your going to get it get the collectors edition it has ultimite doom and doom II and has interviews with id.
3,Think it again...,"Well...Doom 3 is not what i expected, the graphic engine produces good graphics but sometimes they are too dark (maybe in order to hide some graphical problems) and sometimes is really confusing.The sound is very well made with sound effects that help to maintain the attention.The action is not as fast as in other games and some enemies are really really slow.The limited edition disc includes ""Ultimate Doom"" and ""Doom 2""...two classics (practically free) that are always welcome and the co-operative online mode can be fun.Well...if you are thinking about buying Doom 3 i suggest you to rent the game before, then you decide. But definitely not a must-buy."
2,Doom3 by D139,"in their attempt to make the game more ""realistic"" I feel they have taken most of the fun out of it.I'm a big fan of the other titles (DOOM,DOOM2,FINAL DOOM)and this game just doesn't stand up for all it's graphics and realism."
5,Finally,"Folks all i can say is it was well worth the wait. Ive heard people cry that its dark. Yes it is in more ways than one. Its just dark enough to keep you nervous about what is around a corner or behind you. These graphics are without a doubt the best ever produced on any console. The nay sayers are dead wrong. I play (other than an occasional platformer) nothing but first person shooters and while i enjoyed the Halo games as well as Metroid Prime and many others they are well behind the design and gameplay of this masterpiece. This is not a ""run and gun"" game. If you play it as such, you will die and die often. Take your time and look around there is lots to see and find. Believe the hype folks! I did not think these graphics could be produced on any console. Play it in the dark and enjoy."
4,the best of the early fps games,"Before the halo series there was DOOM... followed by doom 2... years later we get Doom 3 and you know, its Still creepy and awesome as ever.I forgot how good this game was! one evening i popped it in and gave it a whirl for a few hours... addicting gameplay, stunning graphics, (xbox 1 mind you) whats there not to like? play this game in the dark because it adds to the experience. sure the story is a bit generic... but who cares.. because youll be too busy blasting away demons and other assorted nasties trying to stay alive..this version also come with the complete versions of doom and doom 2. not a bad deal. back in the day i remember playing the originals on the pc..and personally i prefer playing them on a console now.. its smoother..if you love fps games pick this one up..."
5,You're Doomed,"Doom 3 might be the best XBOX game of 2005, until I play a game that's better. The collector's edition is even better because it includes Doom and Doom 2. Also interviews and specials on Doom 3.This is defintley a great upgrade of the original Doom game. With great graphics, great story, gameplay and a cool ending.Fans of Doom will love Doom 3 on XBOX and PC."
3,Alias Paine,"""If you've just started to read about the Lincoln Assasination then this is a good book. However, if you've read more than one book about the Lincoln Assasination then you might know the information in this book. It covers everything you've ever read about Lewis Powell with some added information that is very interesting . I spent almost 40.00 for the book and didn't learn as much from it as I thought I would. I credit the author for writting the only book about Powell."" Good Job"
3,New Topic for Me,"Let me preface this review by saying that I bought it primarily because a book of the Civil War genre was finally written about someone other than the ""primary players"" and it caught my eye. To one interested in the Civil War but not to any great degree, there are only so biographies that offer enough new information to warrant reading 467 pages.Other than discovering something new about Lewis Powell, the author's enthusiasm for her subject was conveyed throughout the book. This made it a nice read.The reason why I rated it 3 stars is because she tended to put a lot of herself and her theories in the book. I like to read books to learn and get a basis on which to form my own opinions; quite frankly, some of her off-hand comments struck me more as a ""love is blind"" theory than one based on the facts at hand.I DO recommend the book; it is a nice change of pace and it was interesting to learn the history of Lewis Powell."
3,disturbing,"lewis thornton powell was another tragic pawn who paid with his life for the lincoln assassination. he was very young and immature, but participated whole-heartedly and volitionally in the physical and emotional harming of a great many people. had he been closer to home and under the influence of people who cared about him, its unlikely he would have been drawn into this evil plot. what i didnt care for about this book was the subjective nature and the flowery prose. i was left with the impression that the author had a big school girl crush on lewis powell and was actually amused or proud of the things he had done. she constantly made derogatory remarks and insinuations that louis weichmann was the cause of all of powells troubles. she also gleaned most of her information, although selectively, from louis weichmanns memoir. although lewis powell was young, he was certainly no innocent victim of circumstance. he participated fully in every way."
1,Dissapointed,Tried to get a refund of item and after two e-mails NO response from company. Not the way to run a business.
5,Works Great; Easy Storage Solution,"This product is easy to install and even easier to use. Simple, functional, practical. Best of its kind that I've seen."
4,Works great. Nice and Simple,"Does the job just fine. Pretty decent price. I ordered two but only got screws for one, but I just used two drywall screws I had."
4,Bike Rack,Compact and easy to install. Takes the bikes off the ceiling and on to a wall so you are not bashing you head. Takes some practice to get the bike on or off.
4,"Awsome!...I like it, very easy to install.","Hi,Awesome!...I like it, very easy to install. Bought 3, 2 months ago.Make sure you install on the studs.Also very strong - supports 20"", 24"" and a 16"" bikes.Had an issue, trying to hang the 20"" BMX bike as the wheel radial wires are so close together that the hook won't enter thru(hence rating 4,hook could be little thin!.). All other bikes hanged fine!. Opened up space in the garage, as the bikes are now hanging vertical on a wall!.Buy it!.Later found the sporting goods store had it for a dollar more, incase you need it sooner!."
5,Elegantly simple,"Mounts easily (make sure mount is in wall stud or other wood, not simply a molly through drywall); holds bike well. Nothing fancy, nice single digit price."
4,Found for much less at local hardware store,"Local HD had the exact same thing for 4.99 each. Different brand, but same thing with a good gauge metal.Bought 4 at the hd."
1,Absolute shit.,"It's junk. I installed it and it hangs well doesnt come out of the stud or anything but the triangle piece is really weak. After about five times of hanging my bike up the triangle started to bend and made it really unsafe to hang the bike up. I wouldn't recommend, returning it ASAP."
3,"Simple, but high quality.","Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!"
2,hanger,not bad for the sale price but not worth full price. doesnt work too well with fat tires. i would keep looking!
4,It does what it is supposed to do..,"Unfortunately, in my case, the bike sticks too far out into the garage for this to be a space saving option... No fault of the hanger..."
4,Works like it should.,Strong quality material. Install into stud with log screws. But it's physically demanding to lift your bike up into the hook. The hook will scratch your rim a little. I don't recommend this if you love your bicycle. But it does look cool to have your bike hanging on a wall.
5,Foyle's War,Loved all 6 seasons. Well worth the investment of my time. Covers history most would like to forget. Human nature is not improved by war.
5,Foyle at First,"Foyle's War is an engrossing series based in aseaside town in England during the war.Intricate story lines, fascinating characters,and a faithful adherence to history makethis a must-see for viewers who appreciateexcellence as we have come to expect fromBritish television. Michael Kitchen's subtleportrayal of Chief Inspector Foyle, alongwith a superior supporting cast, take theviewer on an intriguingly nostalgic tripback through time to an unforgettablespot in the history of England and theworld. You will hate to see this seriesend!"
4,Seattle made real,"This is a great book that is very well written and researched, packed full of important information that is valuable to the longtime resident as well as the first time visitor. The old photos and written information on Seattle's history was not what I expected, it's a much more modern city. One only wishes that the third edition will have many more photos of the landmarks and have them in color, the are so beautiful as evidenced by the cover. This is the only drawback but there are many more photos here than anywhere else. When its not raining, Seattle has great views. Kreisman certainly has a passion for his subject and based on the bio, lives it everyday."
1,"Surely, the ugliest Turnadot ever produced","Turandot is my favorite opera and I've seen five versions--this one is so ugly, it is painful to watch. I purchased this DVD for the Berio ending, but I won't keep it in my collection. The Devo-inspired sets and costumes are ludicrous and the cast abominable. A dreadful experience!"
2,WAY TOO CONTEMPORARY,Way too contemporary sets with gears and cogs??? Sort of like trying to update a Broadway show. This was a bit of a disappointment as the original story was set in a early dynasty China. I prefer a traditional setting. The music was passable but the sets and costumes are way off the mark. It does not remind you of Early dynasty China.
2,The end of Berio is a Joke,"I didn't paid anything for this . I have no right of written bad things. I disliked the production, the singers aren't fantastic, the Orchestra is superb and the conductor, this time, was in a good day. But the end of Berio is a disaster. Lets return to Alfano. We were happy and doesn't know that."
1,Berio ending stinks,"Many people criticize Alfano's ending with which we are familiar, usually the Toscanini-shortened version. I say to them, ""Shut up.!"" After hearing the Alfano-Toscanini version dozens of times, the full Alfano a few times, and now the Berio,I think Toscanini got it right with the short Alfano. Berio added nothing pleasant, still used Puccini themes at times,and ended with a whimper. The Salzburg production suffers from bad singing, acting, and scenery. During ""Signore Ascolte"" and Non Piangere, Liu,"" Burchuladze looks as if he is going to cry, ""How did I get into this mess?"""
3,A Dazzling Turandot but difficult to hear.,"I purchased this Turandot for the newly revised ending by Luciano Berio, which, while not radically different from the Alfano version, is somewhat satisfying and may improve on repeated viewings.This producting is a glorious feast of visuals. The setting is a gridlike skeleton of a mechanized society, complete with Borg like humanoids and Quay Bros. oversized puppetry. At the center of the production is a magnificent moon/head sculpture from which emerges Turandot. This concept works admirably in this setting. Unfortunately, the miking of the singers leaves something to be desired. Too often the orchestra drowns out the singing and even at maximum volume on all three different audio settings (Stereo, digital dolby, DTS) the mix loses those voices. Too bad, this could have been superb, but it is not."
1,The most revolting Opera DVD I have come across!,"The scenery is cleverly scientific (about the only positive thing I can say about this Turandot) but the machine parts on the actors are appallingly sinister and the whole thing is most unpleasant to watch. If the singers had glorious voices, I would close my eyes and listen to it as a CD, but such is not the case. This is not entertainment, this is torturous to watch; it should never have been made into a DVD."
3,AVANT GARDE?,"Let's NOT get silly about this unusual production of TURANDOT ~ it probably comes closest to the original vision - since it is not realistic [to say the least].RUMOR has it that Puccini loosely based this on fact [his neurotic wife, a fling with a suicide-obsessed maid, etc]. APART from a poor sound engeneering job - the rest is most arresting.Recommended for loves of the Arts who are familiar with other stagings of THIS OPERA, otherwise - stay away.[And stop knocking the tenor ~ someone worth watching!]"
3,"Not a big deal for 5.0, but worth money for older versions.","5.1 upgrade is not a big deal for 5.0 users, since there are no noticeable differences. For older version users, if you have money, go for upgrade. But is Adobe Premiere the best? I don't think so..."
3,"Good, but not great","So I guess I will be the first to knock this book. I am not saying it isn't good because it is pretty awesome. It has some great theory and can help you get a really deep understanding of how kids come to understand math. The reason I say it is just okay is that to me it is more of a research book not a jump in and do this book which feels like the only thing I have time for at the moment. It has a limited number of activities that span all ranges of K-3 math so when I want to work on counting there is but 1 activity leaving me to create more reasons for counting.I have heard he supplies a lot of blakcline masters on line, but honestly have not found the time to look at the moment.I have found that if you are looking for a multitude of activities at your fingertips I would look into Kathy Richardson's series - Developing Number Concepts, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. I feel that they have similar depth to this book, but are much more teacher friendly."
5,Teaching Student-Centered Mathematics : Grades K-3 (The Van De Walle Professional Mathematics),Easy to read and understand. Complete math center ideas and teaching strategies. Great easy ideas for differentiation.
4,Used but understandebly so,I received the book neatly packaged. The book was visibly used. But acceptable and that does not spoil the fun of reading it. For professional reasons I ordered this book and the content is much pleasing and enlightening. I'm not done reading it yet but all the background information I have read was very useful. I expect the rest of the book will be to my liking as well.
5,A masterpiece for Bester,"This was, excuse the pun, Bester's best. An Earth where every has theability to teleport at will, except for misanthrope Gullie Foyle is one ofthe few without any talent whatsoever. Until he discovers he has theultimate talent, the ability to teleport to the stars. Bester anticipatedmegacorporations in this work, which was produced in the 1950s. Anabsolute gem and one of the best science fiction novels ever written,telling the story from the viewpoint of a total loser who goes on to becomehumanity's biggest winner."
2,Lightweight,"If you are looking for a serious, academic read, this is NOT for you. I was disappointed to find simply photocopies of a poem and a few sketches."
2,A Shame,"This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read. If you know anything about James Bond's film career, you will know more than is said in this self aggrandizing book.The only worthy and new knowledge this biography brings to the series is the legal wrangling during the mid seventies as Harry Saltzman sold his shares of Eon Productions. It fleshes out the real life court room and board room dramas taking place.Other than that, When The Snow Melts is a waste of time."
5,Works Great,I have the RCA version of this selector and purchased this Philips version for a second TV so I can use a VCR and a DVD player with it. They're identical to each other and both work as advertised. I added a picture of the rear panel showing the four inputs and the output connections.
1,Lame!,"This was very basic and quite frankly I can't see that very much change could possibly happen with it. There aren't very many moves involved and the instructor is a weirdo, my boyfriend and I couldn't stop laughing as I'm trying to do the moves. I have been doing Callanetics for a month and half and have tightened up and can tell have lost inches (not weight). Callanetics is amazing and very challenging although you wouldn't think so by just watching it. I would recommend that over this method any day."
1,ANNOYING,"The teacher (well...pretty much all the teachers on these Lotte Berk method dvd's) is annoying. The way she speaks....grrrrrrrr!!!!! 10 minutes and I basically stopped the dvd and decided to give it to charity! Stephanie has a serious problem when it comes to communicating - her ability to talk to an audience in a relaxed manner is zero to none. Sounding all staged, artificial, cold and extremely intimidating!There's way too much talking on all the Lotte Berk Method dvd's and hardly any exercises, and the dvd's are too short!You are better off buying a callanetics dvd or core fusion or Bar Method - especially if you're an experienced 'exerciser' like me. Luckily I'm able to attend Lotte Berk classes at the original Lotte Berk studio here in London.As for the Lotte Berk Method dvd's - they're nothing special, all the teachers (except the one with with the short hair) are annoying to listen to. I wouldn't waste a single penny on these dvd's - mainly because of the teachers!!"
3,Annoying Instructor,"It is a good workout if you do the moves correctly. However, this has got to be the most annoying instructor on any fitness DVD there is!!!"
4,Wanna scare the kids this Halloween?...,"Crank THIS sucker when the sun goes down instead of the same old clanking chains and howling wolves. Twenty-one spine-tingling minutes of wonderful, sludgy, Sabbathy DOOOOM, mixed in with an incantation to the Man Downstairs himself :-) An edited version of this (which I've not heard yet) appears on their new album Crush The Insects, but really, you owe it to yourself to get this full-length opus. Metal doesn't get any more evil than this!"
2,"The seller returned my money, but I am not happy with the product.","The VHS tape came to me wrapped in bubble wrap just around the edges of the tape; so that when I opened the tape it rattled in many places. I will not use this tape because I will not take the risk of damaging my player. They were prompt and courteous though and refunded money! ""Pobody's Nerfect""!"
2,easily broken,"My son was so excited when he got this for his birthday. Within an hour the machine sound lever was no longer working, and by day two the buket would no longer move up and down. I was also very disapointed in the plastic pins that secured the pieces together. There was no way to keep my son from just pulling the pins out, and they were a very thin and easily breakable. We returned ours."
3,Just William Rev,If you are a middle school or preteen student you will probebly like Just William. It's slanted probably for middle ages boys. Not for adult unless you like kid movies. RHR
5,great fun for all,My daughter loves these songs. We have so much fun singing them together. I had this when I was a child and I loved it and I knew she would too. I catch her walking around singing day o and the song ting a lay o. I cant wait to buy more of her books with music and share them with our future children.
3,Old jokes,"Maybe funny if this is the beginning of your first toddler year, but most of the jokes are stale by the time the kid is three. It gives you a slightly better feeling of sanity if you really don't have much of a support system or if you are raising the kids alone. A few good tips on playdates were helpful, and if you lack confidence that you might be doing things right, it gives you a confidence boost."
3,Funny but no practical advice,"I am a great fan of Iovine's book and I must have read the Girlfriend's guide to pregnancy at least 10 times and it doesn't stop amusing me, but I was kind of dissapointed in this book because it lacks any practical advice, maybe she's trying to be a bit too neutral. It is OK for laughs, though."
2,Just not that into it.,"I also didn't like it. I don't see what the hype is about it personally. I thought Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy was great but this one doesn't tell you anything that common sense wouldn't! I say if you want to try it out, use the library. That way you aren't wasting your money on it."
3,So-so,"This book isn't quite as hilarious as Vicki Iovine's other ""Girlfriend's"" books have been. The advice is kind of take-it-or-leave-it and is probably stuff everyone has already heard. But, as always, she does have a non-judgemental view of others' parenting styles, and it is a nice easy read. It's not wonderful, and it's not terrible. If you want to own all the Girlfriend's Guides books, then buy it, but if you're looking for good sound advice or a ton of laughs, go ahead and spend your money somewhere else."
5,Thank you girlfriend!,"I bought this book when my girl turned 1, as I realized she was starting to have her own will and was not my baby anymore. She is now 3 and I still use the book for guidance, when things get tough. Vicki gives you friendly and honest advice, just what you need through the little todler crises. It's a relief from all the unrealistic advices that you find in the regular baby books."
3,Fun book to read,"I enjoyed the girlfriends guide to parenting. It was a fast, easy book to read. Another MUST Book for parents, especially when your parenting style differs from your spouse is ""Good Parents Bad Parenting"" by Lisa Dunning"
5,toddler wit is happy,"If you have a toddler, this is a great book to read for hairy days when you are wondering why you ever even had a kid to begin with. Not too serious but good humor to make even the most frusrated mom laugh. If you feel like you need something more, I also love a book written by family expert, Jodie Lynn. In Mommy-CEO, you will get tons of tips for toddlers and preschoolers and beyond. Together these books are a great match. Vicki for humor and Jodie for a little more on how to tips for getting through life with your children as a regular mom. I love both authors -- they are great girlfriends to have around who don't talk back. :)"
3,Just Okay,I was a fan of the Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy and purchased this book on that basis. I was disappointed because it didn't contain as much detailed information as I would have liked. It is just a basic overview of the general things that happen on a day to day basis with your toddler.
4,A funny book for a funny stage in childhood,"Let's face it, toddlers are a funny breed. They do and say very funny things. Thus the perfect material for a book eh? Vicky Iovine is very funny in her delivery of common sense child raising. Sometimes she is too laid back about certain issues and other times she is too gungho. So, depending on your parenting style, you may not like this book. However, she helps you find your funnybone during a time when you may not feel so funny toward your child...she reminds us to laugh at things, and take things in stride. Each stage in childhood has it's challenges, and this book is a fun guide through toddlerhood. Another good book to compelement this one, but a bit more serious and informative is: ""What to expect the toddler years"". P.S. enjoy your toddler today!!"
3,Not my Toddler,"How do you define toddler? This book doesn't seem to do it. Iovine (author) definition of a toddler is a child that is ready to be potty trained, dress herself, and so forth. My toddler (15 months) is not ready for this yet. But she is considered a toddler. Yes, my toddler took her first steps and yes, we have agony over suppertime, but not how Iovine describes it. She wrote things based on her kids and her friends kids. This book was written for a laugh when you are fed up. I'll stick to Dr. Sears."
5,Fun reading for busy and tired-out mothers,"As a first time mother of a girl who is 1 year and 3 months old,I read the book with great interest. It is really a wonder to watch the transformation from a baby to a toddler once she starts to walk, but a little frightening at the same time. Reading this book made me aware of what to expect in the next 2 years, and reassured me that mothers all around the world are experiencing the same problems and joys as I am while raising a child. I was especially delighted in reading the chapter on ""Fashion"", because we do have Baby GAP stores in Japan, and can order from the Hanna Andersen catalog. Unlike most other books on toddlers, this one was so fun to read that I could not put it down. Highly recommended for first time mothers who have recently realized that their babies have become somebody else."
2,Not what I expected!,"I expected that this would be as funny and helpful as Vicki's first two indispensible guides! I must have purchased at least a dozen copies of the other two books as gifts for girlfriends, but I wouldn't waste my money again on this one! Try either one of her other books if you're looking for Vicki's best works. I would have to agree with several of the other comments here that it is a lot like a compendium of previously written articles."
3,Nice book but where's MY nanny...accountant...assistant..etc,"I like this book and I liked Ms. Iovine's other books. She has a truly great sense of humor and fun. My only criticism is that I find clues to her socioecomomic status (read: she's a rich girl) sprinkled liberally throughout this book. Every time I read a reference to her babysitter or nanny or accountant or assistant, I felt myself pulling farther away from her. I just can't relate on that level. I'm not one of her girlfriends, I'm just your typical middle class parent."
4,"Don't take this book seriously, but GET a GOOD laugh!","This book made me feel more normal...it is very funny! :) Phew, I am not the only one!"
4,The Landlords Bible,Jerry Raczkowski did not write the book. I did. Jerry's contribution to the project was one hour where he asked me what was the content. The stories I used came from our joint venture real estate investment history where Jerry declared personal banruptcy to avoid paying my family tens of thousands of dollars he took. His English is too poor to write a book and he should not be selling it as a sole author and collect money for the work he did not do.Anita Kozlowski
5,Good book,"This book gave me some fun, useful tips on how to assert myself as a consumer in an often treacherous marketplace. It helped me to realize that I have rights as a consumer to get what I am paying for. The author also emphasizes that businesses like to please customers, and will often go to great lengths to do so. I will no longer feel uncomfortable about asking for the best price or best interest rate or best whatever. This book gave me the tools to feel confident and to deal with businesses nicely so that both me and the salesperson walk away feeling good (and I save money!). This book will be on my Christmas gift-giving list. I know my mom will love it."
4,Good Collection of Past NASA Info Releases,"Really not a lot of original thought but does a good job of doing a year-by-year summary of NASA. The clips are all directly from NASA so they of course are going to show only the successes. It also doesn't just show space material and goes into topics such as general and commercial aviation safety, electric cars, wind and solar power. Overall pretty good."
5,Really needed it,Really need this book to figure some problems out with the car and it came in a great time frame. Very happy with this purchase.
4,EUROPEAN FAN LIKES IT,"You know i really liked this book just because of that its nice to see great european players past and present in this book. unlike other books where it's just nhl players, this book has both nhl players and european players included. As a international hockey historian i really enjoyed it. gretzky-kharlamov-nedomansky-salming and many other great players are in this book. the price is my only problem with the book, it cost some bucks."
5,"Great , sensitive stories","A rare find, I was lucky a friend knowing I was an avid pet lover ran across an old copy of this true gem of a little book. Take time to read these heartwarming true adventures, i enjoyed so much on vacation, I am now searching this author in hopes of finding some more, of his work, in this area. Sad that it's out of print, but go the extra mile to get it, well worth the read. Timeless, and great help for pet lovers if you do in fact lose your dog."
3,Generic surrealism,"Let's face it, Juan Bunuel is not the master that his dad is. The plot of this most dangerous game variation lurches rather than flows, and the various reality defying tricks added along the way seem abrupt, giving the impression of gimmick rather than a sense of the supernatural. And not to be a spoilsport for all my fellow letches out there, but when you slow down the DVD frame by frame, you discover that Catherine Deneuve is not quite naked in that brief, early shot, but is wearing a semi-sheer body suit. Personally, I can't wait for the Hunger's release."
4,CULT ITEM FOR CATHERINE'S FANS,"This 1974 release was a box office failure.CATHERINE's die hard fans will remember that at that time she was the CHANEL no 5 woman on television commercials.This supernatural story directed by JUAN BUNUEL is interesting in parts,but not satisfying as a whole.Such supernatural films were rare in FRENCH cinema at that time.However, those who admire CATHERINE DENEUVE's stunning figure(a lot of us guys belong in this group)will be in heaven watching this.CATHERINE's legendary blonde hair is much on display throughout,and there's a famous unexpected nude scene.Girls ,if your boyfriend or husband's fantasy is DENEUVE in her prime,buy him this and let him enjoy while you do the shopping with his money.He'll forget about the change."
3,When it works its great,"Their seems to be a problem with the battery housing, the connection is not always completed so the light does flicker from time to time. The connection is also completed sometimes but only to a small degree so the light consistently turns on at a low level of brightness. Also, the light is a lot smaller than you'd expect from the picture, it is small enough to clip comfortable on any book your reading. When the light works correctly it is very bright and is great."
5,I love this dvd,This DVD is the reason my son new his ABC's and recognized the letters when he saw them when he was JUST 18 MONTHS OLD! It shocked the pants off of me and impressed my whole family. The tunes are catchy and keep the kids interested. Start your kids on these DVDs at an early age and they soak it up!!!
4,My 15 month old loves this video!,"This is a very educational video for toddlers. My 15 month old daughter has watched it over and over and loves to dance to it and I don't have to feel guilty because I know she's getting information along with the entertainment. It also encourages the kids to get up and move instead of just sitting there watching. In one segment the children are led through exercises where they try to form letters with their bodies. My only criticism is of baby bear and his baby talk. I think it sets a bad example. My friend's children never baby-talked until they started watching SS and heard baby bear do it and now they think it is cool to talk that way. Other than that, this is a great video and I like that the alphabet is sung and said repeatedly in different ways so that the child hears each letter distinctly and won't mistakenly believe that LMNO is one letter, as sometimes happens when the traditional ABC song is the only way they hear it."
2,Thumbs Down on Baby Bear,"My daughter is just beginning to speak. This video highlights Baby Bear and his significant speech impediment. It's not cute, it's not child-like, it's incorrect pronunciation! I agree completely with the other reviewer who noted that it's irresponsible of CTW to have a character who speaks like Baby Bear. This is not a dig at people with speech impediments -- it's frustration at the choices Sesame Street has made -- to offer a ""teaching"" tool that teaches incorrect speech patterns. We won't play this video again at our house."
2,Baby Bear Bugs Me,"My 17-month-old likes this video and she's starting to point to letters when she sees them although she doesn't say the alphabet or anything yet. My big problem with this video as others have said is Baby Bear. I think it's irresponsible of Sesame Street to have a character that talks that way in a video for young children. Why not stick to the Grover types who overenunciate everything and are really easy to understand? I don't want my daughter to start trying to say her Rs like Baby Bear, and if it starts to be a problem at all, our copy of this video is going to go on eBay and be replaced by something else.Also, it does only highlight a few letters in the alphabet and I think it would be better if it were more evenly distributed. My daughter does like the boogie woogie piggy song though."
2,more entertaining than educational,"This video spends little time actually teaching the alphabet. Much time is spent developing the ""plot"" of why the bear wants to learn the alphabet, but my 2year-old lost interest after 15 minutes. The bear has babyish speech mannerisms which I wouldn't want emulated. For a video that really maximizes exposure to the alphabet, I recommend Sesame Street's ""The Alphabet Jungle Game""."
3,Not the best,"I had bought ""Learning About Letters"" when my oldest son was about 2, which is excellent and will be out on DVD soon. This DVD is not nearly as good - not as much to help learn. The storyline is weak, and there is nbot much emphasis on the letters themselves. Most of it is about Baby Bear's frustration in trying to say the alphabet. My 2 younger boys (4 and 2) have not been very interested in this one.Get ""Learning About Letters"" instead, which does the entire alphabet several times and highlights letters instead of Baby Bear trying to say the alphabet."
3,"Not bad, could be better","I bought this for my 21 month old and she finds it very entertaining, but it's not one of her most requested favorites. We prefer the Brainy Baby ABC's as she has learned her whole alphabet and phonics from it by the time she was 18 months old."
3,"So much fun, so hard to hear","I believe that the majority of the Sesame Street educational videos/DVD's are beyond criticism and this is truly a joyous ride through the alphabet with the BigBird method.But the sound quality on this is appalling. It is so quiet. When normal TV operation resumes, the sound screams out and frightens my 18 month old. In fact, the sound quality in the Sesame Street DVD series is disgracefully inconsistent."
1,My son said his ABC's better before watching this dvd!,"So frustrating!!!!! My 3 yr old loved to say his ABC's perfectly before he watched this dvd. Now he thinks its funny to act like Baby Bear and pretend not to know his ABC's. He won't say them all the way through anymore - he is always stopping and saying (like Baby Bear), ""Oh!! I don't know what comes next!""I know he still knows them, but I just feel like all my hard work has gone down the crapper! I'd blame Sesame Street, but really, shame on me for not pre-viewing to make sure this dvd would be ok for him to watch.I recommend Dr. Seuss' ABC instead. My son loves that movie and it's WAY more educational."
4,sesame street-do the alphabet,"was for my son who is 4 years old,didn't have enough music in it but he still enjoyed it. it was worth the money that was spent on it."
2,Not too exciting for my kid,My 1 year kid gets bored with this with out even watching this for a few minutes .. Some how the baby einstein series is exciting for kids...
2,Not the best Sesame Alphabet title available,"A much better Sesame alphabet DVD is Learning About Letters. Do the Alphabet is stiff and akward, and not much fun."
4,My Little One Enjoys This Show,"I bought this on video at a local thrift shop to try it out before getting one on DVD. I have to say that he does like it alot. He's been watching it since he was 13 months and he still enjoys it. However, its purely an entertainment thing for him. He also has the Learning About Letters DVD since he was smaller, and same thing--totally entertainment. Story line is not a really issue for him. He just likes seeing Bird Bird and the other characters."
4,Great teaching tool......if you can tolerate baby bear,"My 14 month old absolutely loves this DVD. She doesn't sit still and pay attention to the dialogue (the plot?), but she absolutely loves the music. She even tries to repeat many of the letters she hears. She constantly goes around singing, ""EFG, EFG, EFG,..."" The songs are pretty cute - her favorites are ""D, D, D, D (with Ernie & Cookie), the ABC song (with Billy Joel), and the J song.The worst part about this DVD is Baby Bear. He lisps terribly throughout the entire thing. Maybe some good will come of this though, and she will learn more tolerance of those with speech impediments:) Or, perhaps she will grow up to hate lisping bears - who knows. At any rate, even with the baby bear speech thing, this DVD does what it is designed to do - entertain young children."
4,Sing along,"Be prepared to know the songs by heart! The tunes are really catchy, and the kids want to hear it over and over. We bought this to help our Spanish-speaking adopted children learn English, and it helped a lot! Our favorite songs are the boogie-woogie alphabet, the ""d"" song, and the jungle song. A great buy."
1,Teaches Kids to Mispronounce Letter Sounds,"Regardless of whether or not the video is annoying, the real problem is that the main character, Baby Bear, has a speech impediment and does not pronounce all of the letters correctly. For a video that is supposed to be teaching the alphabet and rudimentary phonics, this is a major problem. We watched it once and then promptly put it in the garbage. Sesame Street should be ashamed of itself."
2,Annoying for adults,"I have viewed a great many children's videos in my son's 18 months, but this one is like nails on a chalk board for me. The bear is obnoxious (says ""oh, man"" about a hundred times), has a speech impediment (not good for children who are learning pronounciation), and appears to learn the alphabet in a single day. I won't say my kid doesn't like this video, he does. It's just not the first one I reach for. We are going to try the Alphabet Jungle Game next. Also, ""1,2,3, Count with Me"" is an excellent video and much more watchable than this one."
1,This one's a dud!,"My kids, ages 1 and 2, are Sesame Street video junkies, but they won't sit still for more than 2 minutes of this awful video. The opening sequence where they set up the ""plot"" (such as it is) is way too long and features the lamest character in the lot -- Baby Bear. The skits and songs themselves aren't bad, so my husband and I are thinking of taping them to another tape and editing out all the garbage in between. We don't have any other alphabet videos so I can't recommend an alternative, but if you're just looking for a good Sesame Street video, my little ones love the 25th Anniversary Celebration, 1 2 3 Count With Me, and Elmo's Sing-Along Guessing Game."
2,Just so-so,"My 2.5-year-old loves Sesame Street and is really into Big Bird right now, so I thought she'd love this. She already knows most of her letters, sings the Alphabet Song, etc. But the story didn't really hold her interest. As with some other SS videos, I found the production a bit weird and disjointed. When Sesame Street's morning show has so many wonderful approaches to letters and alphabet, I wonder why they didn't incorporate more of those appealing segments.But what do I know. I thought ""Big Bird in Japan"" was really lame, too, but my kid loves it."
3,"Ok, but not great","After reading some of the other reviews before I bought this for my twin 2 year olds I was very excited. After watching it I have to say I'm disappointed. The songs are great, but I don't think the overall storyline is great or easy for young children to follow.I think they go through too fast, emphasizing some letters and just blowing through all the others.If I could go back I wouldn't have bought this DVD."
1,not right,The wrong item was sent to me so I can't really rate the movie. Its a shame cause my kids really wanted it.
5,Highly Recommend This Video,"My husband and I were looking for a way to teach our 2.5 year old son his ABCs. He wasn't interested in working with us, but does like movies. We read the reviews on this and decided to give it a try. It has been fantastic!!!! Not only is he saying his ABCs and is now interested in them, but he loves to sing and dance to the DVD as well. It's also great for our 11 month old daughter. She laughs, claps her hands, and thoroughly enjoys it. Great entertainment for both kids, and we don't mind it either. It's a winner."
5,Great video!,"My 8 month old daughter loves this video. When Baby Bear comes on the screen, she squeals! I even remember watching some of the clips when I was younger. All the songs are great. I highly recomend this DVD."
3,Buy Richard Scarry ABC instead,"The problems with this DVD are that it doesn't effectively teach the alphabet and it is pretty annoying. A fair chunk of it is Baby Bear complaining with a whiny lisp, and Big Bird patronising him. Big Bird even runs an ""alphabet support group"" (like psychotherapy) which I think is a really unsuitable concept for young children. But worse than that, the letters are not taught in a systematic, complete way - only selected letters are featured prominently.For an alphabet DVD I would recommend Richard Scarry ABC or Learning Songs instead of this one."
4,My 23 month old can say the alphabet!,"I agree with some of the other reviews that Baby Bear's baby talk is not great, but the video provides many other speakers to emulate, such as big bird and the children. And my daughter LOVES it -- she asks me for ""abcs!"" every day, and she dances and sings while watching the video. Repetition is key in learning, so the fact that she wants to watch this over and over is great. And the songs are catchy, not annoying! (especially the boogy woogy sheep!). Love it."
5,KIDS LOVE IT!,"My dd loves this video. We watch it everynight. My daughter just turned 2 and doesn't really talk that well. But she has picked up on a few of the sounds of the letters. She gets so excited when they get to ""Z"" (she will scream it.) I believe this video will help her to vocalize different sounds and altimately get her talking faster."
4,Great Learning Tool,"Purchased this for my Grandson who is 4 months old. He has watched it three times and is very fascinated with it even though the theme is too advanced for him. However, it will become a great learning tool in the near future. Sesame Street is the greatest."
5,Give Barney a break,Most of the available videos for kids are simply episodes of the shows from TV. What makes it neat for the kids is that they get the fancy cover with the prerecorded video.
2,Very Disappointing,"I liked the cover of this video. It has an alligator, a bear, and a cougar on the front. It just didn't teach my nine year old the ABC's in animal names when she turned two. It's the most dreadful video to teach the ABC's to any toddler. This video may be helpful to you, but it did not help me."
1,DON'T waste your money!!!!,"This was one of the few bad Barney tapes I've seen. I bought it at full price and ended up selling it for $5. The lady telling the story entirely scared my 1 year old son. She had these big bulging eyes that even frightened me. Definitely DON'T waste your money on this one. There's tons of better ones--such as Barney's Big Surprise, Once upon a Time and Let's Play School. Buy those instead!!!"
2,And I'm Pro-Barney....,"I have to say that this video is not as good as some of the others. I do, believe it or not, enjoy watching Barney with my toddler, but this one bothers me. Since my son loves Barney, we watch a lot of it. If that sounds like your child, choose a different video...you'll be thankful you did! I like Once Upon a Time and Imagination Island in particular."
1,One of the worst,"This is one of the worst Barney videos I've seen. My 2 year old likes it least of the 15 we own. There aren't any real animals, and the songs and children are extremely annoying. Good Day/Good Night is much better, along with Barney's Talent Show. Try those first!"
5,An insightful look into the world of the military community.,"Charlie Hudson has used her extensive knowledge of both the military officer's and also of the military spouse's worlds to create a story that rings very true to life yet interesting to read for anyone who hasn't been there also. After being in the military for over 21 years, I can honestly say that some of the emotions and insights she gave are new even to me. A superior first book that makes me look forward to her next."
5,Fascinated!,"I have never written a review before but stumbled upon this listing while googling (of all things) the Barksdale Officer's Wives Club phone number (to pass along to a friend). As the co-author of Generals' Row and Barksdale Blues, I was so excited to see another novel set at Barksdale. I read the summary and the first page...I am hooked! Cannot wait to order a copy or two! Good luck to Charlie!"
4,Wool Sweater,"On sale, this was a reasonable purchase. The wool is soft and comfortable, but thin so. May not be what someone in a cold region is looking for. Color and fit were accurate."
1,Yukon fiction perhaps,"This book seems to have been written a long time after the author left the Yukon, and he didn't bother checking maps or books, as his knowledge of even the most basic Yukon geography is minimal. His comments about many of the women he met can charitably be described as ""juvenile."" In three attempts to find the good stories in this book, I was only able to get through half the book before putting it back on the shelf."
4,Yukon at its finest!,"My husband & I have both read this book twice, once a few years ago, and recently since we journeyed up to Whitehorse in the Yukon. Now that we've been there, it makes it much more interesting reading even though we both immensely enjoyed it the first time around as well. It's a hilarious rendition of life in Whitehorse in the era of the 1950's. Everything was cause for a celebration back then. Harold Hine tells of many pranks, wagers and parties. It's fast reading."
5,No one like Richard,"I first purchased this book in 1982 and really loved the exercise routines and Richards's overall diet and lifestyle advice - It is direct and to the point. Todays diets are gimmicks and complicated and some are ridiculous.. So when I went to find this book in my myriad of shelves - it had disappeared (or else it is buried somewhere) and thanks to Amazon I was directed to a source that had a used copy of the book - came it great shape- So I am doing the exercise routines and enjoying reading the book again - it really is about calories and exercise - very simple, good book. Haven't seen or heard about Richard in ages - he did so much good work.."
4,Inappropriate music.,"The music presented on this DVD falls into the ""What were they thinking?"" category. It appears nobody was thinking at all. I guess I've been spoiled watching silent films projected in a theatre to live, scene specific piano score. So imagine my horror when, during devastatingly tense scenes of murder and mayhem, the soundtrack blares tunes such as Pop Goes the Weasel, Row-Row-Row Your Boat, Jingle Bells, Three Blind Mice and Jimmy Cracked Corn. I'm not kidding, folks. Then there is the minute or two of repeated film right at a critical moment. At first I thought it was a dream sequence, or that my player had skipped, but nope. An Oopsy-Dazey on their part. It's hard to kill this great film, but they gave it their best shot on this release."
4,I Lost My Book,"I received this book when I was a lot younger, but my sister stole it from me and I never got it back. Well, I am in nursing college now, and I miss my book! Sad, but true, I am a cooking virgin! I cannot cook worth a darn and I just had to find my lost book! All i remembered was ""eggs in a frame"" because that is the only reciepe I actually got to cook from it! In college, we have limited time and resources, so the book may help me once again. If not, then I guess I have something to give my kids!"
5,One of my favorites!!,"I recived this cook book when I was 5 years old, (I am 27 now) and I still use it often! I love the cute little measuring spoons that came with it. There are food recipies and other fun ones. It is fin to see my kids picking out recipes to make out of it!! I love this cookbook!"
4,Klutz Kids Cooking Cookbook,"My sister received this cookbook when she was little and it has the best chocolate chip cookie recipe in it. When my sister moved, she took the book with her and I wanted to get a copy for myself. When I received the book, I made a batch of cookies and the memories of when I was younger came flooding back to me. I highly recommend this book for people of all ages. Also, the playdough recipe is easy and fun too."
2,Decent addition to your MMA Collection,"This DVD is nice to have for the amount of fights you get for the low price. But most of the fights are of low quality featuring lesser known British fighters, who's skills are definitely not UFC/Pride quality. The best part is seeing Anderson Silva and Michael Bisping in some of their earlier fights. My biggest complaint is that the quality of the video is very poor. It looks like it was filmed on a handheld camcorder. Another problem is that the first two discs seem to be running at 1.5x speed. I don't know why they did this but it is very annoying and the fighters' movements look very unnatural. So I'd only recommend this to people that want to see Anderson Silva fight Lee Murray and Bisping knock around a few scrubs, but don't mind the low picture quality. To me you're better off watching this on youtube because the quality is about the same."
2,Not a bright gold leaf,"The descriptive image is bright gold leaf and vibrant bits of color. (I have previously seen an old silk screen similar to this.) The screen that I received was not a ""gold leaf"" but a dull gold color back ground with subdued color print. I liked the print; but not on the dull green wall where I intended to hang it. In comparing what I received with the image, I realized that the photographer used a high intensity light to achieve the bright gold leaf effect. The seller was very courteous and made returning the screen easy."
3,Only Three Episodes?,I love Tec the Tractor. I hope my son will grow up to love it too. I give the show itself 5 stars. but the DVD I only give three becuase there are only three episodes. Way too short for the money.
5,My daughter's favorite show,"My 21 month old daughter loves Baby First TV and Tec the Tractor is her favorite show. When the show is over she says ""more Tec, more Tec"". She likes to name the different animals and make the animal sounds. I have to admit, I even enjoy watching the show. It's very entertaining."
4,Tec is awesome! (More please!),"TEC gets FIVE stars, but unfortunately the meager number of episodes forces me to a final assessment of less than five stars.TEC is a gentle, quiet, but extremely attention-grabbing and educational program. My children LOVE it, and it doesn't hype them up or make them grouchy like some PBS kids shows do. I even enjoy it!The only reason I didn't give the product itself 5 stars is because for the price you should really get about 6 episodes at least, as each episode is really quite brief."
5,Wonderful,Tec the Tractor came very quickly and was in good condition when I received it. I'll buy from this seller again. Thanks.
3,Decent Underated Band (3./5),"Stormlord - At The Gates Of Utopia is a average Synphonic Black Metal release. I'm really into Death Metal,some Black Metal rules but a lot I don't care for. I would however consider real true Black Metal bands such as (Immortal,Enthroned) to be bands that never disappoint in the scene of Black Metal. Anyways those of you not familiar with Stormlord they play Synphonic Black Metal with keyboards present but don't sound overly commerical like Cradle,Dimmu and Borknagar. I usually can't stand keyboards but the way its mixed with the drums and guitar riffs fits well with the music on this release. Lastly those of you that can't stand the production quality in a lot of Black Metal,theres no problem here great production but yet not to polished to make it sound fake. Worth a listen,much better than overated trendy gothic junk such as Cradle Of Crap,Borkniger,Old Mans Child,Susperia"
2,Poor quality,I have purchased many Melissa & Doug products and the quality is usually excellent. However this puzzel is poorly made....at least the one I got is. The pieces are not clean cut so they are difficult to put together. And on many of the pieces the paper picture on the front is loose and peeling off the cardboard backing. That's the condition straight out of the plastic bag in the box. It's not like we have made this puzzle 10 times or anything. I purchased another one of these (Solar system floor puzzle) but haven't opened it yet. It better be of a higher quality than this one or I'll return them both.
3,floor puzzle,"The puzzle is a little bit difficult and if the kids are little they tend to scatter the pieces everywhere. It is great for maybe 5 and up or just for one alone. The pieces are hard to fit together and that is a little bit of a drawback as well as you really have to push hard to get them together. It is beautiful though. I would recommend it be put on a piece of wood to make it easier to place the pieces or on a hardwood floor or tile, carpet definitely does not work well with putting it together as it is too flexible"
5,Melissa & Doug,3rd Melissa & Doug puzzle purchased! Nephew loves the puzzle and uncle loves Amazons price and shipping. Very satisfied.
2,Not sold as advertised,"Sold as like new, but the box was split in one corner, damaged all around with kiddie colouring pencil marks all on the inside"
4,"Beautiful Puzzle, But Could Use a Better Picture","We received this puzzle as a gift for my 2.5 year old, and overall it's lovely. It's durable and has vivid colors, with enough variation to make it not too difficult for perhaps a 3 year old. My daughter has limited interest in it at this point, but I'm optimistic that her interest will only increase.I found it a little irritating that the picture on the box doesn't encompass the entire puzzle, and the only place to look to see how it should look is two incredibly tiny pictures on the sides of the box. Especially for younger children - the box states 3 and up - it would be nice for them to have a picture to look at to help them understand how it all should fit together."
5,Melissa and Doug: another great product,"The picture on this puzzle is very vivid and real looking, and the pieces are thick and fit together well. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Great, colorful Melissa & Doug floor puzzle","My girls love doing Melissa & Doug floor puzzles. This one is really colorful, with big pieces and is fun to put together. The 48 piece size is great since it is not as overwhelming as the 100 piece floor puzzles are for the younger one. Amazon's price has been great for these as well. The solar system 48 piece is also a hit in our house."
4,Still fun after 3 years,"I bought this for my daughter almost 3 years ago, and she still loves to put it together and she is almost 6 now."
5,Melissa & Doug Underwater floor puzzle,Beautiful colors. I love all of the Melissa & Doug puzzles...they are sturdy and great for little hands.
3,Not what I expected,"I was given this as a gift for my son and I was excited when I found out it was a Melissa & Doug product but unfortunately, it was NOT a wood puzzle, unless you count cardboard as wood.The image is gorgeous and the pieces are huge and easy for kids to handle and hard for them to lose but unfortunately, my two year old figured out how to peel them apart in less than a week. The edges also bend easily making it hard for a young child to put the pieces in place properly.This is a beautiful puzzle but not a durable one."
4,It's good for bigger kids,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old, because read reviews that is a perfect toy for around this age. Unfortunately, it's not. As soon as I get it out of the box, she manage to unstick some paper from the edges. She doesn't enjoyed at all. Otherwise the colors are bright and it's a very nice picture, but definitely is for children over 4."
5,Can't go wrong with M&D,"I'm a big fan of Melissa & Doug toys. Well made, durable and interesting without batteries. This is a great puzzle. I'm always looking for things my kids can do together and with 3 yrs between them it isn't always easy. This large, 48 piece puzzle is perfect. The both love fish and the ocean and the pieces are easy for the little one to manage. It's still challenging enough for the older one to help."
5,Lots of fun for learning pre-schoolers,"My daughter (almost 4) was ready to move up from the 'baby' puzzles that have chunky wooden shapes/colors to something a little more advanced. This puzzle was a fantastic Christmas present - she loves it and asks to take it out and put it together every couple of days. She's doing a great job of matching the shapes, patterns and colors, and learning the basic concepts of 'puzzle-solving'.The puzzle is large and and the pieces are easy to handle and fit together, and have the well-made quality that you can expect from all Melissa & Doug products. The picture is beautiful - lots of colors and the detail of the fish is really nice. I'll be looking to buy another puzzle with a different picture for her up-coming birthday - definitely recommend these!"
4,Back-Up Camera,"This back-up camera does what I need it to do. I use it for hooking up my boat trailer. I can now back up to my trailer in one shot every time without help. The picture is not super clear but it has enough detail for my purpose. I didn't want to permanently attach the camera to my vehicle so I attached a lighter plug to the end of the camera power cord and I run the cord through my back window when needed. I attach the camera to my license plate with a couple of clothes pins. The nice thing about this camera is that the camera pivots up and down on the mounting bracket so you can adjust the angle to fit your needs. You can also mirror or flip the camera image on the monitor. The quality of the camera and monitor is about what you would expect for $100. I do question if it will last for more than two or three years before it quits working. Overall, I'm happy with it so far."
1,Reconsider,"Product worked well, for a week. Have tried to contact customer service of company (Roadmaster) for fifteen days with no results. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand."
1,Nonghuckdabuck,"The instructions for this item are only in French! How is the average American supposed to read this? Therefore, it is useless for the average person!Rudy"
3,BACK ME UP,GOT THIS TO HELP ME HOOKUP MY BOAT TRAILER - SOMETIME INTERFERENCE MAKE IT ALMOST UNUSABLE - THIS IS A REPLACEMENT AS FIRST CAMERA FILLED WITH WATER IN CAR WASH - SEALED THIS ONE WITH SILICONE HOPE IT HOLDS UP
1,Even with the wired setup the image quality was Abysmal.,I bought this unit along with the wire to make it a wired setup. The image quality on this unit was unbelievably bad even when running as a wired setup. Don't waste your money on this. Instead buy a CCD 1/3 based Camera with as low of a lux rating as you can.
5,Great Product - Clear Image - Easy!,"My husband has trouble turning his neck to look back, and although he doesn't drive a truck or van or RV, I thought this would be the perfect thing for him. I did a LOT of research, looked in stores, talked to people, and finally decided on this back-up camera kit as teh perfect Christmas gift.I was not disappointed. He loves to tinker with cars, and so had a great time installing it himself. The picture is clear even at night, and since the monitor is portable, we have considered just a camera for our second car."
3,Backup camera needs help.,"I installed this (wireless) in my crew cab Toyota Tundra. The daytime picture is fair at best, and poor at night. In reading other reviews, I see this can be much improved by hard wiring. I'll buy the cable and try that.8-1-12, I did hard wire it. It improved the image quite a bit. I no longer picked up security cameras, and baby monitors, but it was hard to wire it up so it looked nice; had to drill a small hole in the floorboard, etc."
3,blurry picture,worked well for about 4 months then lens on the camera spider cracked making the picture ok but blurry. Hoping they will replace at no cost.
1,Roadmaster is a JOKE,"I bought and installed th3 VR3 camera. I worked great for a total of two days and then crapped out. I sent it back to Roadmaster in NJ. Sept 26th and I am STILL waiting for a replacement today, Oct 12th! . I have been on the phone with them twice (waiting 45 minutes on hold the second time). All they can tell me is that they are busy and the ""checks in the mail""....They won't even tell me say when it will ship. I will never buy from this company again.....I am putting a dispute on this charge with my credit card company..."
4,Very good but you need the hard wire overall great little item. Do not need anyone to help backing into trailer.,Great little item no need for any help backing into trailer or seeing what is behind you. Goo camera with plenty of settings. Highly recommend.
1,Outrageous price,"My son has this toy and it is wonderful! He plays with it indoors and outdoors and is very creative in his play when playing with this toy. I wanted to buy one as a gift for a nephew and could not believe what it is retailing for on Amazon. It retails in the store from $20-$30. I think the asking price is OUTRAGEOUS! Why would anyone pay $90-$200 for this toy? The suggested retail price on the Hasbro website is $29.00. I give the toy 5 stars, but can not rate it at that due to the price."
5,What a great toy!,"I got this for my son when he was just over 3. He loved it from the minute he saw it. He fills it with all kinds of things and we take it everywhere with us. Especially the park. This truck has stood up the the toughest, roughest boy play I could imagine, and even some I couldn't imagine until I saw. It has survived rain, mulch, sand, the garden hose, rocks and even a 45 pound kid riding down the driveway in its dumper. I can't imagine a better toy for a young boy. I am buying one for my 2 year old this Christmas so he can have a big boy truck like his brother."
5,We love this truck!,"This has been the best dump truck ever! I am sure my grandchildren will play with it one day and think it's new even then. It's large enough to hold almost anything a child would want to transport - including their 2-year-old sister. Though it's not designed for excellent steering, it does move smoothly and easily. We have had many hours of fun playing with this truck and won't be stopping anytime soon!"
5,Tonka Toughest Truck - The Best,"My grandson is not quite 2 yet but he loves it. Very tough truck, he fill it up, pushes it around, sits in it and on it and he older brother pushes him around it. Every little boy needs one of these. This thing is really built to last."
5,Great gift for a 3-4 year old!,"I purchased this truck for my son last Christmas and he loved it! One year later, after many crashes and trips around the house it is still in one piece. No broken parts! A really well made truck. Highly recommended."
5,Every boy MUST have one,"Hands down, the best toy for a boy. It's tough, it's cool, and it is so much fun for my 2-year old. He will get years of use out of this. Still looks brand new after a year in the dirt!"
2,"Wonderful Toy, but the ""Guarantee"" is worthless","This was a beloved birthday present for our son. So much fun. Until he dismantled the whole thing and I contacted HASBRO about the ""guarantee for life"". They sent me a shipping label and we sent it back, but 6 weeks later still no truck. Upon contacting them they said they had not processed it yet. Eventually we received a plastic, small truck in the mail via FEDEX but we refused shipment. I just got off the phone with HASBRO and they have stopped manufacturing this truck altogether and all those ""guarantees' are worthless now. They offered to replace the truck with several other items but I asked for a monetary refund. My money will go to some other company from now on.SO while this was a fun toy for a few weeks, it didn't last and the reason we bought it- the guarantee- was false."
3,WARNING - can be dangerous for small children,"My friend's one-year-old stood in front of the truck, supporting himself with his hands on the big handle, and his weight caused the truck to flip over (rotating on its front wheels) and smack him on the head. It is recommended for children 3 years and older. You can ignore my ratings, as I have no idea how it rates. I just wanted to warn people about this potential problem if they have small/young children that might be around the toy."
2,made in CHINA,"I try VERY hard to buy toys made in the USA. I ordered two of these and about fell backwards when I looked at the bottom of the box and saw those words I cringe at: MADE IN CHINA.These trucks were to be donated to Toys for Tots (let's be GENEROUS, please) but I'm going to ask someone else to bring these and I'll be buying toys locally to ensure they're made in the good ole US of A. I'd be mortified to be seen with a ""MADE IN CHINA"" toy when the majority of the children in my area have parents who are now begging for help because their jobs were downsized to other countries... especially China.Why can't we add another line on Amazon to state where an item is made? Buy American, keep jobs here. And give to Toys for Tots and your local food bank or shelter, please!!!"
5,Perfect for little boys!,"I bought this truck a few weeks ago for my 'just turned' two year old. He has played with it everytime we're outside since then. He loves to sit in the tray and have his daddy push him around, to get an idea he's 36 inches tall and 30lbs. Other times he'll push his other toys around in the tray. I also added a pull rope to it at times so he pulls it around behind him.I agree with the other posters in saying that this is one tough truck and I expect to be using it for years (and other kids) to come. Well worth the $$$ as opposed to other similar toys out there!"
4,My kids found another use for it,"I have a 5 and an 8 year old who have never played with it as a dump truck. Nope. They sit in the bed and push each other around in it. I don't think it was intended to be used that way, but my son is 50 pounds and it holds his weight just fine. As an indoor push ride-on toy, it has lasted a few years and still looks brand new. And best of all, the kids still play with it."
5,The Little Guy Loves It,"My son (2 yrs, 10 mths) has had this truck for at least 1.5 years and he loves it. Big wheels make it easy to push anywhere. Everything imaginable has been loaded into it and it is sturdy enough to stand up to him sitting in it. A great product with a long life expectancy."
5,Old School Cool!,"Just received this truck yesterday. I'm really impressed with its quality. Durable metal construction on the frame and bed. Overall impression of rugged build. Bright colors. I'm confident it will be a hit with my nephew. He'll be able to sit in the back of it, no problem. Worthy of a Tim the Toolman grunt. Kudos to Tonka."
5,dump truck review,"This truck is very nice. Looks to be very well made with real steel, not plastic like so many other cheap toys these days. My boys haven't had a chance to really play hard with them but they are 12 months old and do like them a lot. This toy is nice because it encourages kids to use their imagination unlike so many of the new toys these days! Definatley looks well built and worth the money."
5,A beautiful and moving recording.,If you are a fan of baroque choral music this is an absolute must have. The recording is crystl clear and the music and choral performances are incredibly moving. I am very disappointed to see that this item is no longer in stock because this has become one of my all time favorites.
4,Moonslasher,"Friend of the author, I have the three books he wrote years ago. I understand he has revamped one book, and has written another, both e-books. Will certainly be on the lookout for them."
5,Moonslasher,"The book cover was what made me want to buy the novel. I'm a horror/sci-fi/fantasy book fan to the nth degree. ""Moonslasher"" is one of my books that I can read again and again and again...without ever tiring of the story. I still get that wierd feeling that whenever I'm walking out alone in the dark that someone/something is lurking there...waiting...watching...teeth, claws...yikes! A great horror novel that plays like a movie in your mind. Awesome creature, great characters! Is there a sequel? One can hope..."
1,I think we have found the Bottom !,"This is very possilbly the worst written and acted movie made in since ""Plan 9"". Having watched it I am still a little Numb! It can only be described as Childish Confused Nosense! What a waste, the director should be ""SHOT""!I will say this the DVD 's cover is a work of art but has no relationship with the movie."
3,Knights in Armor,"This is an Ivanhoe adaption, a classic tale of knighthood. It was filmed in New Zealand. Takes place in Austria the year 1193. Rated PG 13, there rteally isn't much ""bad"" stuff going on in the movie. A fine film about knights."
3,typical,"Tyhical grade B movie. I think it came from BBC, so it may have been a tv series. I still enjoyed it, the acting was overdone, effects ok."
1,THE CHEESIEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"How many palm trees are there in england? There are a ton in this movie! The acting is terrible! Ivanhoe, the main character is always frowning, like he is emotionally disturbed. The sword fights are absolutely fake, and while he is fighting, Ivanhoe has no blood on his sword. The special effects are a joke. The only fun we had was making fun of it. I love medieval movies and books, and I tried to cling to the fact that it would get better, but halfway through, I asked my dad if this was a comedy."
1,Only because negative stars are not available.,"I too was taken in by the cover. I found this DVD at a yard sale for the modest price of 50 cents. I was overcharged! The previous owner tried to warn me and I should have listened.The acting is reminiscent of grade school plays. The plot (?). Oh yeah, there is no plot.To think there is a sequel!? I'm underwhelmed. Insomniacs may find this movie useful."
1,"Don't waste your money, I did.",Can you spell limberger.... I wish amazon had less than a 1 star rating.
3,Deceptively powerful,"The cover looks tame. A quick browse through the pages will reveal The Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, the 23rd Psalm, and so on.Big yawn? Guess again. Suddenly, you'll spot Prayer to Glorious Elegua, Prayer to the 7 Psalms of the Holy Sacrament, Prayer to the Spirit of Desperation, Prayer to the 7 African Powers, Prayer to Win the Lottery, and many more.In other words, if you're interested in Santeria, Voudou, or related traditions, this is a must-own book.And, to add a personal anecdote, I tried a few of the money prayers, and within 48 hours received $161.01 from unexpected sources. Sure, it could be coincidence, but it was a little weird. I'll respectfully consider that it was the prayers, and say thanks to St. Rita (and others) for extra help.If you're interested in African-related and Carribbean-based traditions, this book is well worth the cover price. But, beginners may see only pages of Catholic prayers, with some funky illustrations."
5,This book is an answer to prayers,"I bought this book a while ago and could'nt be happier with it. I use it in my daily devotions to the saints and spirits. This wonderful book includes many many prayers to all manner of saints, african and indian spirits, color correspondences and more. If you are looking for a prayer book then you most certainly have found it."
5,One of the best prayer books,I read an earlier review about how someone described how they thought this book would be boring and to their suprise it was not and they were so right. This is a great book to add if you love to light 7 day vigil candles/saint candles. Very thourough prayers and an easy to find guide for each Saint prayer and color of candle and prayer to go with it. If you love your Saints this book is a must have to pray to them daily. This little gem of a book is fantastic.
4,"Great piano, missing accessories.","I really enjoy this piano. It sounds almost real and it has over 100 voices. I got it at Costco and the manual, songbook and software cd were missing. I am done buying durable goods at Costco. I wonder what songs, voices, etc. I am missing?"
5,Best piano sound for the price!,"AWESOME!!! I was looking for a keyboard to learn how to play piano on.The quality of the Piano sound was the most important feature to me. This keyboard has a grand piano feature that allows the grand piano sound at a touch of a button.Excellent piano sound.There is a lot of great features on the keyboard including a large lcd screen, chord dictionnary ,lesson mode great voices, midi and pc compatible with a standard ubs cable...just read the features of this keyboard.......there is so much more..i compared it to a casio and the sound of yamaha is much better!!!This is perfect for anyone who is just learning how to play or is advanced it does have 76 keys which is very good if you want to learn piano. It also looks great with the keyboard stand LW15 which was design for the DGX keyboards. i also recommand this stand since it securely attaches the keyboard to the stand for more stability.This keyboard is for me...the best quality for the price"
5,Bronfenbrenner Lit Review,This was a great lit review on the development of Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework. It put several previously read articles into a structured presentation that made for ease of understanding.
4,Very Useful Reference Encyclopedia for Clock Collectors,"Brand new, year 2001 encyclopedia for clock enthusiasts. It features 352 pages and more than 700 black and white photos and a special full color section. There's plenty of informative text with data on clock types, clock making, leading clock makers, clock histories, wall and classic clocks, shelf clocks and novelty clocks. The pictures provided are large and sharp, making identification easy. Clock lovers will find this a useful work."
1,Encyclopedia of Antique American Clocks,"compared to the first book, which is a wonderful book, this one was a waste of time -- i wish i had a chance to look at it before i bought it -- i would not have bought it -- j.d.h."
1,waste of time,"The author sets up an interesting source of conflict: magicians that can exercise their magic only by sacrificing someone they love -- the greater the love, the more powerful the magic they can then wield. Everything else about the book sucks; the characterizations are shallow, none of the characters are particularly likeable, and the plot meanders pointlessly. What a waste of time (and trees)."
1,Uneventful,"The story lacks any meaningful characters and no feelings. A good story can express itself to its reader through different feelings. I would also add that the only thing consistant in this story is the fact the author wants to pound into your head that Third Prince Maddyn Kevleren is the greatest general of his land, but the author forgets to actually let the man be the general. Great generals shouldn't second guess and the fact he does on several occasions just shows that the author can't even follow his own story."
1,"Spss for Beginners [Paperback] by Gupta, Vijay","Title: Spss for Beginners [Paperback] by Gupta, VijayBeyond a shadow of a doubt this book is the worst I have ever had the displeasure to purchase. It is beyond my perception anyone would write a terrible text of this magnitude but to continue to publish it is simple a crime. I do not know the person who wrote this (I cannot bring myself to classify them as an author) but our penal system has a place for them. SHAME ON YOU GUPTA, VIJAY !!Charles Nuckols"
4,"Excellent, Very Well Done!","A very well done piece of work to say the least. Lots of pages, but the concepts are very focused. A very real and applicable book for everyday marketing and brand strategy; as well as a top notch brand management operations guide. For evolution planning and complex marketing planning one of the ebst ever written! I highly encourage getting this book."
5,Easy to read,"While I don't agree with everything Paul Kyriazi says, I very much enjoyed his conversational style of writing. If you are looking for HOW to be James Bond, this isnt the book for you... but if you are looking for a book about thinking and acting like James Bond, this book is a winner. (Ladies, you should know that its more geared for guys). All in all I enjoyed the book for what it was, a James Bond Mindset book."
5,Sage Advice for 'Would be' Heros,"Having long been a fan of the James Bond movies, I was intrigued by the title of this book. After reading it I was impressed by the sage advice and insight the author provides. Kyriazi isn't saying you should pretend to be a super spy. Instead, he aptly points out the ways in which you can adopt the characteristics that make up a super confident well put together Man. In an unfortunate age of young men being raised by well meaning single moms, we need as a society, role models for men to follow. Kyriazi points us in the right direction, demonstrating that a man needs to be poised, confident, suave, courageous and on the right side of the law. I learned a lot from this book. Bravo!"
1,This book is bad. Very bad.,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a fun read about the super spy that many guys want to emulate, even if the most dangerous thing they do is cross against the light. Boy was I ever wrong. This is a laughable ""self-help"" book written by an author who is clearly a self-help book junkie. His only advice on how to be like James Bond is to spend lots of money, use a money clip (??), keep a calendar, and have a clean desk. Somehow, I dont think this is going to turn me into 007. The author also suggests that you read lots of other self-help books too. Then it ends with a wierd self hypnosis thing that is supposed to be empowering. Or something. For anyone expecting a book about James Bond and his lifestyle, this will be a huge disapointment (as it was for me)."
2,Disappointing,"Just to clarify, nowhere in the book does the author talk about ""how to be a Bond girl."" This book is for men only. It's next to useless for women. And even for men, I think it would be pretty disappointing for anyone expecting more than what you could learn by renting a few movies."
5,Why hasn't anyone recommended this book to me before?,"I've only finished the first chapter, so perhaps this review is premature, but I've been deeply struck so far. My only question is, why hasn't anyone recommended this book to me before? Or, why haven't I come across this perspective anywhere else? It represents an approach to solving one's problems that is fundamentally orthogonal to everything else out there, in both the church, and the world. So far, I would recommend it."
2,Wasn't as good as I'd hoped.,"I suppose I shouldn't be complaining about 7 bucks, but I didn't think this book was all that the other reviews made it out to be. As others note, it was very short and in my opinion not very interesting or insightful. I hope his other books are better - I just got ""Understanding People"" so I'm hoping the reviews aren't a let-down for that one either."
1,title not helpful,The title of this book makes you expect too much about the actual book. Very little is included about this topic and the writing is not for the layperson. I was hoping for more of a simple understanding. Too many controversies in the text without clear solutions.
3,Awkward fit,I bought these for my small weenie dog (she's tiny) while she is in heat. They fit extremely awkward. The tail hole is super low.
3,good but not great,"Although deliciously woody and peppery, the fragrance seems to dissappear rather quickly, requiring MULTIPLE sprayings throughout the day. Wish this had knock out sillage.....it's such a beautiful scent."
1,Waste of time and money!,"This is a collection of information already on internet and by doing a few searches you can get it all. I would not pay for this.I bought this book to learn more about the subject matter as we define policy for our company, however this looks like it's advertising about a product the author sells.Waste of my time and money."
3,Diving for the Physicist,"This book may benefit a physicist but probably offers little benefit to a diver or dive instructor. It has been a while since my math and physics classes and I found this volume daunting. If elementary particel interacton, hydrodynamics or maxwell equations are of interest to you then get this book. If you looking for usefull dive information or explanations look elswhere."
3,Beyond basic,Vary informative! Covers every aspect of scuba dive physics. All you need to use this book is a PHD in physics. Not your basic how to book.
1,Not like Jane Austen,"Many people seem to enjoy this series very much, but I find this book and the others as mysteries feeble, and as historical fiction unconvincing. The plots are improbable, and characters cardboard. Most annoyingly, Miss Barron has distorted the characters of jane Austen' family until they are unrecognisable, most unkindly of all, she portrays Jane's mother as a raving imbecile. miss Barron is lucky not to be haunted by Mrs. Austen's indignant ghost. If Jane Austen had written mysteries, they would have been a lot better than these. In fact, most mysteries are better than these."
1,Not edited very well,"Not sure what all else is wrong, but if you're familiar with reptiles, and you already know what neurotoxic and hemotoxic are, this dictionary has them reversed (their definitions)."
3,"Good Filling, Terrible covers and binding","It is a good dictionary. Reads well, great info. I am on my 2nd and need my 3rd because of the covers and bindings. It calls itself a hardcover book, but the binding is weaker than on a paperback. And like a paper back the covers tear off with use.It might stand up if I had a proper stand for it."
1,This book is completely inaccurate,"This book depends on outmoded and homophobic theories to prove its point. Simply put, it was written in 1979 and feels like it was written in 1879. There are logical holes and factual inaccuracies. Also, much of the science used to back up the author's arguments has been disproven. Its only use as a book is as a historical document of the sentiments of some people in an earlier time."
2,Predictable,"The main reason I bought this book was because of comments in other reviews about ""twists and turns"", which is a big selling point for me...BUT, the author's use of frequent and obvious foreshadowing made it too predictable for me. It hooked me in at the beginning, but I sort of ""deflated"" thereafter as every prediction I made came true. Blah..."
5,Thought-provoking and Deeply Moving,"Shadow of Death takes its title from the Bible but the title also refers to the fact that every death casts a shadow over the survivors, particularly when violence is involved. More AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY than a conventional thriller, this well-paced novel is in a category with Thomas Cook's award-winning RED LEAVES. It deals with the repurcussions of a violent event on the lives of ordinary, good people. It emphasizes the ripple effect of acts of violence and our reactions to them throughout our lives and those close to us. A truely thought-provoking book. Excellent for discussion groups. I recommend it very highly."
2,On the fence with you,I had quite a few issues with the book. Laura's mentor thinks she will be a great doctor and totally brushes off her errors in judgement. Her husband does not challenge the fact that their love life stops abruptly. Friends that work by her side cannot see her pregnancy. Talk about a fairytale life. Last but not least...there had to be more than one blond in that hospital. I really disliked the fact that the rest of the characters paid in some way for their crimes and the doctor pays for nothing. Maybe it would have been better if all the racial stuff was omitted.
2,Deeply unsatisfying,"This book was free, and it was worth it. What a waste of an interesting premise. ""Shadow of Death"" begins like a thriller, but soon devolves into a semi-romantic chronicle of the life and family of a promising medical student. The promising medical student happens to have survived this one horrific incident, and people all around her pay the price for her actions. Never mind the ""Shadow,"" she carries on her charmed life getting just about whatever she wants. Although I got bored about a third of the way in, I kept reading to see if the heroine would ever be called to account for her stupidity. I'll pass on future Patricia Gussin efforts.By the way, Dr Gussin, Glock pistols did not exist in 1971."
2,could not get into,I could not get into this book. I am 50+ female and after couple chapters put it down and have not picked back up.
5,A gut wrenching fanominal read,This was a book that was extrememly difficult to put down. The twists and turns were out of this world and blindsiding.
3,It was good,This was an okay book but I felt like it had too many elements to the plot line. I tried explaining it to a friend but that took me ten minutes just to get through the key points.There were four different stories intertwined and about four different climaxes it was sort of confusing as to where the main focus was supposed to be centered.Over all I enjoyed it but will not list it as a favorite.
4,shadow of death,good reading for the first book i have gotten with my new kindle. i do think after all the things that happened to laura i would have gotten out alot sooner.
4,Great read,"I thought this was a really good book. The story kept me coming back whenever I could to pick up where I left off. Usually the free books for the Kindle are okay, but this one was alot better than all the free ones I've read so far."
4,Good Read!,"I didn't expect this book to be so thought-provoking! It reminded me a lot of the movie Crash, as all the characters' lives and decisions tragically impacted one another. Other reviewers pointed out a few minor nitpicky details, but I don't believe they negatively impacted the story line in any way. I would recommend this book and I look forward to reading the author's other related works."
3,if you are having trouble falling asleep ...,I found this book interesting but slow. At times it was hard for me to keep reading. A little morethan halfway through it picked up and I then found it more enjoyable.
3,A distracting read:),I had a free day and spent it reading 'Shadow of Death'. I'm glad I read it but wouldn't read it again. Which is typically my standard for a 3star rating. I cared about the characters but found the never-ending entwining relationships a bit exceptional and an obvious convenience for the writer.
2,Never finished,"I really didn't get very far in this book. Even though it was free, I don't get the time back. Just didn't like the writing style."
5,Excellent Story,"Such a wonderful story! I was able to take a personal interest in the character's lives. The way the author provided just enough information to draw the reader's attention, but still keep you guessing was masterful! I will be recommending this book to everyone I know."
5,Awesome,"For a free book, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't want to put this book down, it sure was heartwrenching. The lives of the Nelsons' and the Jones' intermingled so eerily, and the scandal with Dr. Monroe also added some twists to the story. If you've got nothing better to do then read this book, you wont regret it."
2,wish I could have enjoyed this book,"I was only to get through about half this book before I lost interest. The main problem is that the characters do not display any insight into their own conditions or that of the people around them. This is perhaps not surprising: most ancient religious mental viruses promote a worldview where submission and obedience rather than analysis and insight are rewarded, and this book is permeated by the Christian/Catholic worldview."
2,"Nice and simple, but nothing more...","This book is very light and entertaining. However, the story is an ill-concocted version of the Seven Habits of highly effective people by Dr. Stephen Covy, which is, by the way, the book you should REALLY get.Contrary to this lame copied version of poor story-telling, the Seven Habits is a very deep and moving book. It has substance and depth and if you are prepared to listen, it will change you life.Ok, back to this book... the book is alright I guess, if not for the very annoying fact that the story is completely based in the Seven Habits, it shows a lighter version of the habits that may be entertaining, or otherwise a good way to get into the habits. Who knows, it may lead you to the other book, which is good.If you prefer substance over ""lightness"", don't get this book. Furthermore, as another reviewer puts it, is poorly writen.I'm only giving two stars over one, because the habits in which it is based are really something to look into..."
4,Good Book with Basic Principles,"I really found this book fun to read and easy to follow. The fable that the author used to convey his message kept wanting to not put the book down; wondering what was next. Ideas are very similar to ""7 habits..."" I was originally given a copy if this book as a gift, but bought another one to give to a friend."
1,Absolutely Terrible!!!!!,"I bought this disc for the broad diversity of selections. I was not disappointed by those. The CD does indeed feature a tempting array of compositions. Where this disc is sadly lacking is in the sound. I have hundreds of CDs, but I have never run across a more poorly engineered disc! The sound is shrill - almost vulgar! Every track is stringent and hollow. I was almost in pain listening to it. As I said, it is absolutely the worst disc I have ever listened to. Avoid it at all costs!"
3,Okay,I purchased this for my son (almost 7) as he loves maps. It's too difficult for him at this time as the pieces don't lock together. We will probably remove the pieces and let him use the puzzle board as a map since there is a world map under the pieces. Hopefully he'll be able to use it sometime in the near future.
5,Our Toddler loves doing this puzzle,"Our 2.5 year old really enjoyed doing this puzzle when we first bought it for him - figured out how to do it by himself after a few weeks of daily fun, and in the process he learnt all the continents and major oceans. he plays with it every week or so now (6 months later) and still enjoys doing the puzzle."
3,"Nice, durable puzzle but inaccurate map","Very nice puzzle with good colors and fun details. However, the map is not accurate and this bothers me. I don't like that South America is skewed so far east. Melissa & Doug maps are well made but they need to pay attention to accuracy. Their US map doesn't show Mexico and Canada so it looks like an island."
5,Ecuadorian... Excellent,Juan Fernando is one of our most wonderful songwriters here in Ecuador...His music is very well done..Buy his first album too... is also great....
3,It's live!,"Please note that this is a live recording, and not just a collection of greatest hits. If you are looking for the original songs (like I was) you will need to look elsewhere."
3,Decent lens,"Nice to only have to carry around one lens, but it is a rather heavy lens. Works great, though. To zoom with the lens, it just slides in and out, you don't rotate it like you normally would operate an SLR lens (at least any I've seen). Kind of weird to get used to sliding the whole lens instead of turning it. I much prefer the turning method for zooming."
4,Lovely Crystal Cake Plate.,"It arrived relatively fast. There wasn't much bubble wrap, I'm surprised it came unharmed. I bought it as a gift for no reason for my sister. She loves it. The dual functionality of the cake plate is a nice feature.I took a chance and ordered this item considering the last buyer received it in broken peices I consider myself lucky.Deffinitely take a chance and order this cake plate...it's a solid nice set."
1,Beautiful Item.... Inadequate Packaging,"This is a lovely item and would have been great over the holidays since it could serve so many functions. Unfortunately, it was not properly packaged. The inner carton was just a mess of glass. The shipping carton had a few pieces of brown paper in it.... certainly not enough to pad the inner carton. The shipping carton was huge in comparison to the small box and would have needed a LOT of bubble wrap and/or peanuts to make this work. My guess, this was broken before it left the warehouse. I doubt UPS had any chance of delivering this item in tact. Amazon did promptly refund."
1,broken,"I had to order it twice, and both times it was broken in pieces. I really wanted it but I guess it wasn't meant to be. :("
5,This puzzle is awesome!,"I bought this puzzle for Christmas for my two-year old niece. Not only did she learn how to put it together, but she loved it so much she would sleep with it at night! It has counting, colors, left, right, and a puzzle to boot.The only negative was it arrived with a broken peg. A little super glue and it was as good as new. I would keep a close eye out for those pieces to break off as they would be choking hazards for little ones."
4,Another great learning tool from Melissa and Doug,"Our little girl absolutely loves puzzles, and this one presented a real challenge. The pieces are somewhat irregular, left from right, which allows for growth in her problem-solving abilities. I bought this when she was 22 months, and she has been able to master it quickly. Not only do the pegged pieces help define fine motor skills, but the numbers, colors, and left/right make this a multi-dimensional learning tool. She's 24 months now, and has most colors down as well as learning to count. The colors were really helpful, because being the neurotic parent, I was beginning to wonder if she had some colorblindness because she wasn't recognizing colors at first. But silly me, I forgot she was a toddler. So much for my fears of why she isn't solving quadratic equations."
1,Rough edges,Haven't even opened it yet because there are rough edges that will have to be sanded down before my granddaughter can use it.
1,please stop buying her books,"Why are her books still being published? She is a horrible, horrible, writer? I read the exerpt for this book on MSNBC, and wow! Was it ever terrible? She is a blitering idiot. Please stop buying her books so we are no longer assaulted with such awful writing--or please, editors, edit out the trite."
1,"Waste of money, buy lingerie instead","I'm on the fence about whether I should delete this out of my Kindle. Other reviewers have hit it on the nose -where yes Mama Gena has some great ideas, yes the element of fun is a necessary component to a successful marriage, however the whole idea that you should start a group of women with the purpose of flirting with each others husbands is completely ludicrous and corny. I think if you are even considering this manual and you are reading this review you're already on the right path and your heart is in the right place. Best wishes."
3,Fresh perspective,This book coutradicts all we gals have been taught. Not sure i buy into it all but putting some things into practice so we'll see how things turn out.
5,Delicious ice cream!,"This is a wonderful machine!If you're looking for ice cream in 15 minutes, go to the store. Good ice cream takes time. Time to prepare a good mixture, time to chill the mixture and after making the ice cream, time to harden it. I read several reviews on different ice cream makers before deciding on this one. People who say their mixture didn't freeze in the ice cream maker didn't take the time to properly chill the mixture before putting it in the ice cream maker. And when the machine is done, you will have soft-serve ice cream that needs to harden in the freezer for several hours. Don't expect to make a quick batch for dessert after you're done with dinner.About the machine itself: The compressor is fairly silent, just a low-noise fan blowing. The top motor with the paddle is a bit more noisy and tends to get a little louder when the ice cream gets thicker. Once you taste the ice cream, you'll forget all about the noise!"
1,"Product no longer supported, Deni knows nothing about it","I thought this ice cream maker was great until the top motor quit working. Since that's not the compressor (expensive part) I thought I could easily get a replacement top motor for it. However, when I contacted Deni, they said they no longer made it, they knew nothing about it and certainly couldn't help me with replacement parts.Bottom line, with so much to go wrong with this machine, spend a few extra dollars and get one from a reputable company."
1,Deni Should Be Ashamed,"I can't believe anyone would put something this poor on the market. First of all the compressor kept kicking out after about 15 min of use. I found that if I put an external fan on the unit, then the compressor stayed on. I then tried making one of the ""ice"" recipes. I followed the instructions precisely and properly chilled the mixture. After the unit ran for about 20 min the paddles started to jerk about due to the heavy ice formation on the sides of the container. This jerking caused the mixture to splash all about. Finally, the ice buildup was too much for the motor and it just stopped. Then I couldn't get the container out because the splashing ran down between the can and freezer and froze solid. I am going to try an ice cream type formula to see how that works. At anyrate, I'll still have to return the unit due to the compressor cooling issue. The internal compressor fan must be defective."
1,Piece of junk!,"Wish I'd never purchased this piece of junk! I am using REAL cream and REAL milk--from my beautiful Dutch-Belted cows. Nothing but the very best ingredients! My mixture FREEZES to the SIDE of the container before it's done, stops the paddle from turning,which leaves the center of the ice cream as SOUP, and the outside HARD. The volume never increases beyond where it was when I poured it in (it is supposed to increase by half, again). I might as well have mixed up the ingredients and put them directly into the freezer without ever having used the ice cream maker. Supposedly, you're to get ""soft serve"" but it never gets there. The timer is always off; all in all, this is a very unsatisfactory product. And....it's made in China. Watch out!Elora McKenzie"
2,it works,"i got this amp new.The good: LED lights and chrome look sweet.The bad: it doesnt hit hard enough, really mellow. The soft turn on/off didnt work well when it was NOT bridged. whenever i would turn of the amp you could hear a pop from the amp.The verdict: i wouldnt really want this amp to power my subs. this one is best left to the speakers."

5,This is a Great Book!,"This is a great book! It is not so often a children's book makes me roll with laughter, but this one did! It is witty, funny, and makes young girls rethink their idea of the life of a Princess and happily-ever-after's, which is so needed to be done! Bravo, Ms. Dorantes! Will there be a sequel? Can't want to find out about the continuing adventures of Princess So-Wise!"
5,Perfect kids book!,"Found this great book on Amazon and loved it! I'm a single father and have been reading this book to my daughter ever since I got it. Can't find other works by this writer but would sure like to buy others like it. I ordered several copies of this book for my daugher to give to her friends. Writer, keep up to great work!"
2,Do your research,"I was not very happy with this product nor was my 5 month daughter. It reminded me of something you can buy at a swap meet for five dollars. I was also very disappointed that it only plays tunes for five minutes. I have never heard of a baby who falls asleep in five minutes. It's cute but not what I was looking for. My fault, I should have done my research."
3,replacement cover,"received product promptly and it fit perfect. my only dismay was that I spent as much on s/h fee as I did on the product itself. I weighed the product once I received it and it was lightweight, should have been much less to ship."
5,TABLE TOP IRONING BOARD COVER,ORDER ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WELL PACKAGED.. IS PERFECT FOR THE TABLETOP IRONINGBOARD I CAN TO USE WITH MY SEWING/QUILTING.. WILL ORDER AGAIN..
4,Mini-Board Ironing Pad,"Aloha, this little pad fit our travel ironing board very nicely. However, I had to carefully stretch it onto the board. At first, it looked like it would be too small, but it fit. WalMart, Target, and other stores had travel ironing boards but not a replacement pad...and our old board was a lot better than the boards their making now. Good purchase. Aloha, Rudy"
5,Fit nicely,"my mini iron board(different brand)pad is worn out, at first I'm thinking to buy a whole new iron board, so try to look for 1 in amazon and discover this, just to give it a try to save some money, it fit nicely with my 12X32"" mini board, and it get the job done, that's enough for me. It is hard to put it in at first, cause is very tight fit, but once it's in it state put. just order another 1 for backup."
1,Poor design for ironing board cover,"The ironing board cover is indeed easy to put on... however, pad is covered in silicone making it a rigid and uneven ironing surface. I used it only twice before retiring for a 100% cotton cover."
1,Horrible!,This is not a good video! Someone in my family was afraid of the Winkster. What on earth is a Winkster? I don't think people should put characters like a Winkster in kids' videos because they don't know what a Winkster is. Big thumbs down!
5,A great production!,"This video is filled with everything you could want from Barney - music, humor, and of course, love and learning for all kids!"
4,Great Classic Game,"Was taught this classic card game by a 90-year-old friend who's been playing it all her life and taught all her twelve children . . . had a ball playing it with her and bought it for Christmas for several friends who also like playing card games! The bigger the group, the better the game, as things move faster. We even tweaked the rules and let everyone play at once - a whole new game!"
5,Our Family's Favorite!,"Our family loves this game. We play it at my In-Laws, who have had it for years. We wanted one for our immediate family, but could not find it in stores. I was happy to find it on Amazon, and the children were thrilled to open it on Christmas."
3,Used to play this while a kid -,I haven't found anyone to learn this game with me - it has been so long since we played as kids. But I love the memories with family fun times.
1,ridiculous game- very complicated,"I bought this card game for my son who loves games and cards in general, so when we went to play it we found that is pretty complicated with multiple piles and a difficult flow. I truly do not recommed this game unless you know someone who actually already can play it."
4,Flinch,"Classic card gameBasic Play Summarized:-Play by discarding numbers in order onto central piles, 1 through 15-5 Discard piles for each player, one ""Flinch"" pile (goal is to get rid of 10 Flinch pile cards)-Call ""Flinch"" to penalize a player for NOT playing their Flinch card first, and transfer one from your Flinch pile to theirsPros: Overall is Very Good fun, simple play, but must look several players ahead at times, so some strategy, enjoyed by everyone we've ever introduced the game to (repeat plays)Cons: NOT ENOUGH CARDS IN ONE PACK for play with 4 players- should buy TWO packs"
5,A great game for all ages,"Flinch is a simple card game that's been around for many, many years. My Mom and Dad used to play with friends on Saturday nights, ""back in the day"" when people got together to play cards. She and I would play when I was a kid, and now my Mom (68), my daughter (12) and I all play together. Simple building on piles of cards from 1 to 15. The object is to get rid of your hidden pile of 10 cards before anyone else does. Nothing complicated, but fun - and people of all ages can play together."
4,Game was okay.,"There are different ways of playing this game. We played around the holidays with six people. We all got bored and decided that maybe playing with different rules would make the game go faster. It has been around a long time. I give it a higher rating in the overall category because I think the game has more potential than we gave it time for. After we all had played the game, we decided that the next time we would not take turns but rather have an ""open"" playing time like PIT. It has to be somewhat fun or it would not have the longevity that it has had for this many years."
3,Flinch,"The rules to the original card game were difficult to understand and didn't seem fun. When you add the wild cards and play the more modern version, it is just like skip-bo."
1,TOTALLY CONFUSED!!,"I ordered this game as an added savings when purchasing another game. I thought it would be a great game for my family. We have never been able to play. The instructions are very very confusing. Four adults have read thru the instructions (3 being college graduates, 1 of those is a computer programmer) and we still aren't 100% sure how it should go. Maybe we're making it harder than it should be but I would not recommend buying this unless you have previously played and know the rules."
3,It needs to grow on me,"I read the glowing reviews about this game before I bought it, so my expectations were high. I like the game, I just don't love it. There is too much to do and remember; perhaps with practice and familiarity it will become easier and less cumbersome. I will keep trying to love it."
3,A slow play . . .,"Based upon the earlier reviews of this game, I expected more. Although enjoyable enough, the game moves incredibly slowly -- at least for a group of 4 adults. I can, however, see why families with children would find this game fun."
2,Too General To Be Of Use,"Unfortunately this book spends more time about shopping for an RV than the actual RV and it's systems. The Woodall's guide is both elementary and detailed and assumes you've already purchased the RV.In short, if you want tips on buying an RV and a cursory glance at the water, LP, and other systems, this is a passable book. But if you want to REALLY understand how things work, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere."
5,The Ultimate Guide,"Really terrific. A comprehensive guide to all things RVing. Great for novices of veterans alike, no matter if you're taking weekend trips or full-time RVing across the country. Couldn't recommend it more highly."
4,Rv newbie,Enjoyed this book and learned a great deal from it. The author covers all aspects of RVing with factual information with the right dose of humor.
2,Must have gotten paid by the joke,"There was some good basic information in this book, but he could have put it in about one-third the space if he cut out all of his stupid jokes, puns, and other silly references. I'd give it a miss, there HAS to be something better, almost anything would be."
1,Kindle edition is a rip off,This is a good book but pricing the Kindle edition way above the paper edition is a complete rip off.
2,Too simple for good use,"I am getting ready to purchase my first RV, and was highly disappointed in this book. You can get the info in it within minutes from any reputable RV dealer. This is not a book I will be hanging onto."
2,TOO MANY STUPID JOKES,"As a newbie to the world of RVing, I was appalled at the limited amount of useful information in this book. This author spends WAY too much time making retarded jokes every other sentence instead of getting to the point and providing useful information. The bad part is that he's not even funny. I found myself rolling my eyes heavenward with every turn of the page. There are bits and pieces of useful information here and there, but not enough to warrant anyone buying this book. A person more versed in RVing will be insulted at the lack of information and a newbie like me won't get enough useful information to feel comfortable operating an RV for the first time. As a personal note to the author...if you ever update this book again, leave your ridiculous ""sense of humor"" in the trash where it belongs and write a serious book that will be useful to the intended audience. Spend your money elsewhere folks. There are better resources out there than this!"
1,Almost worthless,"As a new RVer, I was hoping to get some quality advice from an experienced pro. Unfortunately, most of the advice is either common sense (you can't drive an RV like a sports car) or overly generalized (an anti-sway device will help your trailer track straight) with little truly useful information."
2,"A too ""Light"" read","Disappointed. I was expecting more detail and specfics. It seems as if each new chapter or aspect of RV'ing was introduced as if it was going to expain everything you needed to know, but then only provided the highlights without giving you a complete picture. For example, Chapter 12 covered plumbing systems in 13 pages with items discussed in no more than one or two paragraphs. If you like 378 pages of puff and jokes you may like it. I wanted more."
4,no complaints,"We are just starting out exploring hitting the road. We weren't looking for too much info....and this book delivered what we needed. It covered the basics that we needed to consider re: renting, purchasing, what to look for, why to look for it...., as well as ways to make sure we were going after what suited us. If your beginning the 'thinking process' re: RVing.....I trust you will find this book very helpful....as well as fun to read."
1,Pass On This One!!,"Don't waste your time on this book. The author spends way too much time tring to be funny and cute. Very little usefull information at all. Try the RV'ers Bible. A much better book. Well written with lots of good information. Again, Pass On This One!"
2,Lame,I thought this book was lame. It might be slightly helpful prior to buying but not much good after a purchase.
4,"Dated, But Very Helpful & Comprehensive!","I really enjoyed the book as well as the humor infused throughout! As a future RV owner, I want to be informed & educated about RVs and the RV lifestyle before I make such a major purchase, and this book went a long way toward giving me the knowledge & confidence to do so!! The one issue I do have with this book is that, being published in 2002, it is not current on any of the newer models & innovations now on the market, nor can it take into account the effect the 2008 recession has had on the market & lifestyle! It does, however, provide a good, solid foundation, and is presented in simple, layman's terms which were very easy to understand and comprehend! I do recommend this book to novices & current owners alike!"
3,Not particularly well made,"The head on this brush, with its mixture of brass and tampico bristles, is good for when you want a little more scrubbing power than a brush with fiber or plastic bristles alone. However, as noted by other reviewers, the head is poorly attached and pops off the handle very easily. The harsh but honest truth about this brush is that the handle is worthless, and if I'd wanted a brush without a handle, I would have shopped for one in the first place.I would not buy this brush again. It didn't do the job I bought it for, it is poorly made, and I consider it 90% wasted money. Its one saving grace is that the head, minus the useless handle, is just the right size for giving the showerhead of my espresso machine a quick scrub to dislodge coffee grounds."
1,Poor design,"I need a brush for my cast iron cookware. The head of this brush pops off with minimal pressure due to an incomplete ring. The wire retainer only goes about 1/2 way around the head, which does not allow any reasonable pressure to be used for cleaning. It happened with my first use and all subsequent tries. I have since purchased alternates with more attention to their design. Be warned."
5,Focus 21 Jojoba Shampoo,"My husband has been using this product for the last 15 years and they quit selling it at the beauty supply where he would get it, then we found it at Long's and now they don't carry it. It is the only Shampoo (he has tried others)that keeps his dandruff down. So I would say to others that may have a skin problem to try this product.Focus 21 Jojoba Shampoo 12 oz"
3,a great performance in very mediocre sound,I bought this DVD because of the above review - and the review is quite correct except that it fails to mention the sound quality which I found poorer than most pirated recordings of the 60's - that is congested and at times unclear. The picture quality also shows its age. Characters can lack clarity at times. BUT the production is wonderful and Donald Gramm is a pleasure.
3,I knew I would wrestle,"When I saw this years ago, I knew I would wrestle. I would link this to starting my wrestling career."
2,Background bass,"2 1/2It is hard to dismiss such a consistently smooth tone, but Orchestra falls into the elegant bass player's least engaging material, following in the same minimal footsteps heard before and after, but lacking much to say in between all the hypnotic posturing."
4,Fun Cookbook,Loved the commentary and the recipies are great too :) made a great addition to the 'grill baskets' i put together for Xmas presents/bday presents for my friends.
2,Painful,"The book is very detailed and concise, and yet written in a style that is almost painful to read. Very dry and monotonous. You can easily imagine an university professor droning the words of the book.Well researched, a lot of information, but not something that can be casually read. Written in a very dry style..."
2,Not what it's cracked out to be,The projection funtion is pathetic - doesn't project onto the ceiling at all. The other light is a bit too bright to have in the crib at night. The only good thing is that it doesn't need batteries. This is not a cheap toy - rather invest the money in something the baby will get a bit of use and enjoyment from.
1,Waste of Money,"We bought this when we saw our daughter fall asleep looking at the reflection of a candle flickering on the ceiling. The So called projection on the ceiling doesn't work. The light bulb is not powerful enough to broadcast it on the ceiling, instead, it just shows faint light, if any at all. There is a small disclaimer on the box saying something to the effect that the product needs to be at the right distance from the ceiling in order to view it properly. The right distance is about 6 inches! Do not buy this product, you will be sorry."
1,Big disappointment,"My son likes to look at lights, especially bright images. However, when you attach this product to the crib you can ""barely"" see the projection on the ceiling, the images are ""very"" faint. This product needs to be no more 2-3 feet away from the ceiling for the images to project clear."
2,Dissappointed mom,My husband and I bought this a few years ago for our baby and could not use it in the crib as the music was too loud and the light too bight; and the projection on the ceiling was barely noticeable. It was usless until our daughter was sitting up and playing at which point we would lay it on its side toward a near wall (no further than 2 fet away) and she could see the picture show. Another problem is that when the light burns out it is extremely difficult to open and change it. For the amount it costs it should have been better quality. I would not buy this again unless it was improved.
5,Keeps son happy at bed time,"My son loves this toy! We got it when he was 2 months old and he loved it then, and he still loves it two months later. He gets two light shows every night, and he is almost always asleep by the end of the second light show. I would buy this again, and give it as a gift."
2,cute but unclear,"its a cute idea, but the pictures are so unclear, especially when compared to the FP aquarium monitor. put your money towards the aquarium monitor whether or not you use the monitor part."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Terrible. This product is cheaply made, flimsy and produces no visible show. Try the Flutterbye Dreams Lullabye Birdies Soother. It is a MUCH better product and it has several different songs, an in crib show, as well as a great ceiling show."
3,Dream Show Review,"I have used my light show every night since my son has been 2 months old (he is now 17 months old). This toy made it easy to train my son to fall asleep on his own, since he could lay and watch the animals and figures drift across the ceiling. I would definitely recommend this toy to anyone that wants their kids to fall asleep on their own, and enjoy going to bed!!!"
3,Not such a bad purchase,"My daughter's name is Stella Luna and we received this gift from my aunt. She got it because her granddaughter has it and loves it. She still falls asleep with it in the bed at 2 1/2. Stella loved looking at the reflections that were projected in a soft focus when she was in a crib and now loves to sit in the dark of her room with someone there to look at the front viewing window to identify moons, stars, clouds, etc. If you are willing to enjoy and point out beautiful aspects of the toy's moving art, you and your child will enjoy this."
5,Very sturdy and lovely toy,This is a lovely toy. It is sturdy and has been in the crib of all three of my children. The batteries last a long time. It has been on road trips with us and has worked well. It plays calming music and has lovely 'show' on the ceiling.Well worth the money.Enjoy.
3,Unfortunate Problem With This Toy,"If you intend to buy one of these little gems youyou had better buy 2 of them! The light burns out withinthe year (with regular use)and it is a true pain to change it.The cost of a second one would be well worth the aggravationyou are going to save. It is a real shame something so coolcan't last. It obviously does not burn many candle watts so I can find no reason for this. There are NO instructions anywhere for changing the bulb either. Wonderful idea, not much thought into its problem though."
2,Good concept but bad quality,"I don't know about everyone that wrote a review for this item but it takes more than 7 minutes to put my baby to sleep. The idea is great, the music is nice and the holograms are great but I dont understand why this item could not run on batteries and why it has to be hand wined. I have to go in the room and wined the toy every 7 minutes."
4,One Problem,I loved this lullaby dream show except for one problem: the straps that hold it onto the crib aren't long enough. My crib has thick sides and the straps won't go around to attach it to my crib. Kind of a bummer! But if you have regular crib sides it should work out just fine.
5,A thoughtful adventure,"This is more than an adventure novel; it is far more than just another untold chapter in the life of Sherlock Holmes. By mixing elements of Doyle, Haggard, Verne, Collins, Kipling, and others, Thos. Kent Miller has created a remarkable literary melting pot that will certainly appeal to fans of Alan Moore's ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" series or of Philip Jose Farmer's Wold Newton universe. By using a voice other than Watson's usual eye-witness account, Miller avoids the difficulties inherent in many pastiches; nothing in the writing style should distract the reader from enjoying the epic quest(s) the protagonists undertake in this tale. Their discoveries include both the physical and metaphysical, and Miller leaves the reader with new ideas that will linger for some time to come."
3,Nice. But outdated.,"I didn't look to see how old this book was before I purchased it. While it does have some useful advice, many of the products and techniques discussed at out of date. I've found more useful stuff on manufacturers web sites."
4,It told me what I needed,"It told me what I needed. Unfortunately, it only has one page on additions with SIPs but it was enough to let me know it is not the best of ideas. disappointing, but necessary info."
3,Arguing for the Technology,"Good book to explain the fundamentals and ideas behind why Structural Insulated Panels area a good building medium. Unfortunately, the solid information on estimating the costs or tricks to design that the interested party are looking for are not there.I look for someone to write the next book in the series."
3,"Good, but basic","This book is a good primer for anyone who has doesn't know much about SIP's, but I found it quite basic. Also, there are passages in the book that show just how badly it is in need of an update. For instance, in the first chapter, it says something to the effect of ""...with energy costs being relatively low, builders have a hard time selling energy efficiency and sacrificing the two story fake stone arch...' If this technology is to get a solid foothold in the building industry, MANY books should be written to provide builders with the resources they need to handle both high-end custom homes and affordable homes as well.In short, if you are just trying to get up to speed on what SIP's are, this is probably worthwhile. Otherwise, spend some time on the phone and visiting with your SIP dealer, talk to contractors who have used them, and look around online. I think you will find more detailed and specific (and UP TO DATE) information."
2,Outdated,"This book has been around for 10 years now, and it's time for a rewrite. The industry has matured and there are more choices now, and this text should be reviewed and redone to reflect today's SIP market. If you're clueless and want a very general overview of what structural insulated panels are, this is an OK read, although inaccurate in places. If you're looking for specific information and technical specs, you're much better off searching the web for manufacturers' sites and downloading their installation manuals."
5,The Word Rings Out!,"I have read many books, none compares with this! It speaks about Creation and Existence with so much clarity. Many attempts are made daily to explain the Purpose of Man's existence, this book sure points the way to new recognitions!"
1,Terrible one,"I was so happy to know it's on sale and bought one home to play my Silent Scope3But the focus is jumping from point to point. It's really frustrated to use this rifle toaim sharply at any emeny. It makes the game un-playable with this rifle. I have togo back to use xbox controller in the end. The worst case is, they didn't let mereturn it (even if I just bought it 5 hours ago) with everything looking like origalpacking. DO ensure seller allow to return if you are not satisfied before you buy.Unless the 40 bucks cost like 40 cents for you."
1,Hate it,"This rifle is a joke. It has a amazing look-and-feel. I neverhesitated to buy it when I saw it. But when it is connected to xbox, it gave me horrible gaming experience. I hated it. How can they sell this kind of junk? I will cut all connected cables on it, and give it to my 3 yrs old nephew to play with, he may like to have a handsome gun."
1,Seller sold junk,The seller I bought this from has neglected to reply to any emails sent to them. The rifle had missing parts and does not work properly. This was my first experience with Amazon and I will never use it again if this is how business is done here. I will also spread the word to all the people I know that buy things offline not to purchase off Amazon due to the problems that I have encountered.
4,Good buy,Just started riding and wanted a pair of leathers. These were great price and fit great. I bought my waiste size and fit just right. Very comfortable.
3,Leather pants,"I have a pair of the LP500 pants and also a pair of the Jafrum pants with the laces up the side. I haven't worn them, and Jafrum won't take them back. I'll make someone a good deal on them. Size 34.DumagueteCity@NOSPAMhotmail.com (remove NOSPAM before emailing me)"
2,"Missing ""The Fox""!!","No one can touch Wes.Great double disc, 5 stars, *EXCEPT*, The Fox isn't on there! Fortunately, I have the Reel to Reel and was able to redeem this flaw myself.Most people wont go through that trouble though!Wes, you are sure missed.Don"
1,Lasted 3 months and died,Used it for a disconnect to my battery on my camper. Less then a 30amp circuit and it failed within 3 months.
5,Great buy,Exact replacement works great. It came fast and i would recommend someone buy it. At least i did not get a replacement like other companies that did not fit.
3,One Downfall,"I LOVE this concept, but I have a real issue with the spelling errors on the kids' writings. I understand these are 7 and 8 yr olds but there's something to be said about teaching revising and proofreading before a final draft that's going to be published. My son is having a hard time reading the books in this series because of the incorrect spelling. We purchased 7 of the 8 books in the series."
2,"Terrible ""poetry"" - no child could enjoy this","I love the idea, but this is poorly executed. Read some of the excerpts online. Instead of rendering a story kids could enjoy, the focus is on rhyming, so what you get is third-rate poetry that trudges out a Shakespearean plot. If you try really hard, you can understand the story-line, but no child would want to spend time with this book the way they do with successful kids' books."
3,"Not just ""La Cage"" AW FUL","Having been a fan of this series since the first album, and having seen numerous productions of the show, I was eagerly awaiting this release. Better luck next time. The targets are soft, the rhymes and gags are recycled, and worst of all the impersonations are lousy, with the possible/passable exceptions of Bernadette and the ""Wicked"" gals. With all the devastating success achieved in earlier editions skewering Patti Lupone, Julie Andrews, and others, why trot them out again when this recording's singers aren't recognizable as these stars, either as imitation or parody? The only real fun was had whenever the inspired Christine Pedi joined in. I'd recommend this only for completists."
4,"Much good, wish there was more","As noted below, there is much to laud in this CD; the performers in the parody on ""Wicked"" are as good as the originals (and I prefer the parody more!), and the ""Assassins"" parody is sublime (as is the original). I would buy the CD for these alone, as well as the take-off on the Tony Awards show. And many other nice parodies and spoofs. But I just wish there had been more here that was new (some melodies from earlier versions are recycled), and that there were longer parodies on the shows (like the ""Wicked"" parody, or earlier ""Les Miserables"" parodies). While I enjoy the Liza/Ethel Merman/Patti Lupone parodies, we've heard the like of them before. 25 more minutes of fresh, new material would have brought the star-level up.But, of course, for ""Forbidden Broadway"" fans, this is a must."
2,Creative but...,"Rating this just on the CD alone, it's creative but not anything like being there for the show. A Large part of this series success is seeing the expressions on the actors faces, and the sight gags. Based on the CD alone I have to give it just two stars. Even having seen the show, the CD simply does not ""stand up"" on it's own."
4,Made in China,"I was surprised that this filter is made in China. A quick search on the internet revealed that a lot of AC Delco parts are made in China. I was expecting it to be made in the USA. See my customer images posted. The filter is not shiny stainless steel like the product picture, but it is black like the product picture on the AC Delco website."
2,Docking Station for I touch,Quick DeliveryHard to dock the I touch. The design of the docking station interferes with access to the docking port.Docking Station does not charge the I touchSounds goodControls on remote onlyDo not recommend
5,best yet,"my sister went through five docking stations before she found this one, so I bought it first! Works like a charm with great sound and very portable. A best buy!!!! Price was under 100$.Six months later, heavy use later my station is going strong, my sisters is over a year old and well travleed and till works great. Still a great buy."
5,Love it!,"I really enjoy the sound of this JBL ipod speaker system. I have it at work, and it's small enough that it doesn't take up space on my desk. The delivery was very timely too...Thansk Amazon!"
3,"Decent sound, but the full size version is better","This is a good miniture versions of the legendary JBL Radial iPod dock, but does not feature the same sound quality due to the use of smaller speakers, and other cost cutting measures. Be sure to also consider the full powered version:JBL Radial High-Performance iPod Loudspeaker (Black)"
5,"I noticed a change right away,","This was an easy upgrade in which I could install between the throttle body and the stock manifold on my 93 GMC Suburban. Much quicker response on take off and passing. I'm glad I picked this product, easy to install, all I needed came with it, and now some extra punch to the take off. I would recommend to friends and family."
3,hepa filter for DeWalt vac,"This filter is fine if you are careful. but it is expensive. watch out! my son used it to clean up powder from spackling on the floor, and the fine powder totally clogged the filter. Even sticking it in the washing machine didn't help! So be sure not to use it for fine powders like flour, just the typical grit, or you will find yourself forking over a lot of money for a replacement."
1,Dewalt DC5151H Vacuum Filter,I purchased the Dewalt portable vacuum for use in cleaning the floors in my truck. It saves me money to do it myself than going to the car wash. I keep it in my house and used it to clean up a small powdered sugar spill on an area rug in my kitchen. I brushed it out then decided to wash it in the sink. The filter was totally clogged even though you could see daylight through it. I have no choice but to replace it. The fins are hard to clean as they resemble an automobile air filter. Not one of Dewalt's better products.
5,a must have,purchased this filter as a spare one for my dewalt vacuum... is great to have the spare when you are in the middle of a job who wants to take the time to clean the old one... just replace it and clean the old one later...
4,Dewalt air filter,Good product. Fast delivery. Good seller. Highly recommend this seller. Will buy from in the future.Yes yes yes yesYes yes
3,Croco'nile,I cannot rate this because it was out of stock and I never got it. I sure looks good though. I wish I had gotten it.
4,A delicious read!,"A very good book. Mandie has learned that she will be allowed to visit President Taft, if Grandmother goes with her. She goes with her, and meets up with Joe, Sally, and Uncle Ned. Mandie and her friends enjoy exporing the White House. But, her explorations take a mysterious turn when Mandie believes she sees George Washington! She begins to see him again, and thinks she hears a mysterious plan! The truth is very unusual, and a rather let down after all the suspense. It is still a good Mandie Book, so be sure to read it!"
5,A good book!,"In book #12,Mandie is off to visit the whitehouse!When she gets there,she also discovers that her friends Sallie and Joe are also coming.Mandie and her friends think that some people are trying to kill President Mckinley!Mandie thinks she sees George Washington walking across the whitehouse lawn!To find out what happens,read ""Mandie and the Washington Nightmare""!"
5,I loved it,In Mandie and the Washington Nightmare Mandie is going to visit the White House. The mystery had a pretty goofy ending but besides that it was really good.You probably think I'm dumb but I actually liked the parts when Mandie was kind of mean to Celia it made it more interesting.
1,"Zero stars, not available","Ear-splitting, tone deaf vocals leave you grinding your teeth. Tried to give it a chance, but after the third listen-through, in the garbage it went. Absolutely, gut-wrenchingly horrible."
5,Pleasing Pagan Tones,"Length:: 2:28 MinsThe Mother, The Magick, The MusicI've created a video review for the MP3 download of The Mother, the Magick, the Music, by Alexian. However, the CD is also well worth the price of admission. I simply wanted to take advantage of the instant gratification option Amazon so kindly offers customers."
2,Ugh... Not as good as expected,"My wife has become a recent fan of Chai tea, so I looked for the highest rated Chai tea on Amazon and bought her a case for Christmas. Well, I simply can't agree with the other reviewers. This tea has a very weak flavor, and not nearly as tasty as the cheap grocery store tea she had grown to like. I am disappointed that we can't return it, because we won't drink it, and wasted almost $30."
3,Reasonably good,"Smells terrific. However, flavor is not as potent as smell is. I found Trader Joe's Organic ""Ruby Red Chai"" to be a cheaper and more pleasing experience."
1,Not for programmers.,"A lot of money for a book on the back ground of VRML and 3D in general. Doesn't really cover programming in VRML, not even the basics. Only chapter I could find was on VRMLSCRIPT which looks okay but I use JavaScript. Most of the referances are outdated or not available anymore and the CDROM has very little content, mostly URL links to deleted sites. The only programming chapter uses a 3rd party front end language tool which can export to VRML, alas this isn't on the CDROM and is no longer available at the URL. About 60-80% of the book is about what you can use VRML and 3D on the web for, I have an imagination so I can figure most of that out. I guess it's back to the dozen or so downloaded refs that I already have, I really wanted a book I could site down with and get a better understanding of some of the concepts and programming techniques in VRML, this isn't it. (If I had been able to find it in a bookstore to look at first it would have been left there.)"
4,Interesting book about heavyweight subject,"Vacca's 800-page review of a heavyweight subject is broken up into stages to allow the reader to dip in and out. The book cannot be classed as an 'idiot's guide' because it does assume some level of prior knowledge, but most readers with enough interest to read the book will have a grounding in the subject anyway. Vacca's style is accessible with interesting tangents mentioned such as science fiction and the influence of the sex industry. Conclusions and summaries are welcome, as is a guide to computer jargon. Also, one of the most appealing features of the publication is the use of pictures to illustrate the theories discussed. In summary, the possible technological applications and overall introduction to an in-depth subject are well covered and anyone with an interest in learning more about the Internet and how to harness it is advised to take a look."
1,Not a very useful book,"This book 'talks' about VRML. However, it has very limited scope with regard to ""real world"" applications and it contains almost no code examples. Almost completely useless for programmers."
5,"""VRML Clearly Explained"" is a *must have* for your library","Once again, Mr. Vacca has published another great technical book! VRML Clearly Explained is the standard of excellence in VRML books. As a both a manager and ex-programmer, the content of this valuable book helped me understand high level concepts of the state of the art VRML concepts while giving me lower level programming guidance.Anyone interested in VRML needs to consider this book as a ""gotta have"" for their reference library. The use of graphic snapshots is very well done throughout the book. Reference chapters are thorough yet easy to read. RECOMMENDED FOR ALL LEVELS OF TECHNICAL READERS."
3,Flimsy cards,"Hard to find rook cards, so was glad to find these. The cards are flimsy though and don't hold up well. They were not in expensive either"
1,Deluxe Rook Cards Not Really Deluxe,"These Rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition. However, the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see. After we opened the cards (two sets were purchased), we found that the Rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside-down. The cards are also not particularly sturdy. These cards appear to be irregulars."
1,Cheaply made set sold for a premium.,"I bought this product as part of a larger order I placed for some games for family game night. My wife and I had always enjoyed Rook, but never owned our own good, new deck. This set sounded nice with it's ""Deluxe"" packaging and inclusion of a ""score sheet"". There's nothing deluxe about it. The score sheet makes no sense for the way we and most others we know have always played and scored and the cards are absolute crap. First game and they are already coming apart at the edges. My first shipment of this game didn't even include the cards in the package! I had to be sent a second game just to get the cards. Save yourself the headache and money and go to Walmart and pick up a cheap and probably better made deck and keep score on a piece of scrap paper. Two thumbs way down on this product!!"
1,Sony PFM-42V1,"Had problems with this screen from the start. The image 'jogs' from side to side every so many seconds. It's not all that noticeable on a moving image, but gets very irritating once you're aware of it. Latest problem (nine months in) is a distinct loss of image quality when using s-video input. I'm told by Sony tech support that the s-video card is going out.Now, here's the clincher. To get any warranty work on this, I have to be without the screen for around 4+ weeks while they use the slowest (cheapest) method to get it to their service center. No loaner, no compensation... just a blank space on the wall.Ask yourself before you shell out for this screen - ""what if it fails? Do I care if I'm without a TV for a month?Of course, you might not have any problems with the screen, in which case you'll be blissfully unaware of the terrible warranty service."
2,A talented writer but...,"This is a book that makes you realize publishers should have a new category: SELF-WHINE. Whereas Mr. Morrow is really an excellent writer, he is just so enmeshed with his own life. After the reader delves through his problems with his heart attacks (and that is sad), he has to throw in a tale about a stray cat that gets into his house. So he pulls out a shotgun to kill it. I have to admit I closed the book at this point but EVERY creature in life has the right to live, Mr. Morrow. Perhaps if you could get out of the importance of your own existence, you could see this."
3,A decent collection,"This title contains 10 short stories, obviously all with the common theme of future war. I wouldn't normally read anything titled ""Future War"", but someone picked this up for me and I felt obligated to read it. I was surprised that some of the stories were actually quite good, such as ""A Dry, Quiet War"" by Tony Daniel. Overall, it might not make the most interesting read - I wouldn't make it a priority, anyway - its suitable when there is nothing else around."
2,you get less than you pay for,"this is garbage...barely useable. im actually going to have to ditch the sub and replace it with something that actually kicks without sounding farty and distorted. of the 4 subs i've owned in previous vehicles, this is the worst. its in the single cab of a truck and it still doesnt deliver.obviously im aware that it isnt very powerful, but that isnt the case here. it actually does deliver strong bass notes, its just that the rubber that mounts the cone to the sub box is clearly some chinese dirt cheap stock that pyle is using for this model.you can put together something MILES better for a similar price at walmart, honestly.save yourself the trouble and dont bother with this unless you like torturing yourself."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!,"Horrible! BAD QUALITY, BAD SOUND, Ended up gutting the tube and using my own SUB and AMP. Speaker grill was also broken when receieved."
3,Meh,"Since I am no expert in the installation of these things, ordering was completely worthless. It comes with no instructions whatsoever. Expect to spend money for wiring (which it does not tell you to get) before actually installing. After having it installed by a friend who knew what they were doing it sounds good but the hassle to get to that point made it very frustrating. After seeing how it installed I have no doubt that with any degree of instructions I could have completed myself in very short time."
2,cheap subs,Its a sixty dollar self propelled sub. Its as good as you could expect a cheap sub to be. It sounds okay unless you push it past half of its ability then it stats sounding like speaker slapping against the wall. I would not buy this again if given the chance to do it over. Spend a little more money and get one that actually preforms the tasks its intended to do with out sounding like its being beat. I shouldn't have been so cheap
1,I can't believe Amazon sells this!,"I wish I could tell you it filled the void of a little bottom end sound in my Formula. I wish I could tell you it was a smoking little deal. Yea for 67.00 I at least expected more than some blue Christmas lights to come on. I verified the connections and it did, for about 6 minutes, work. It sounded ok for about two songs and then nothing.Still had the red power light, still had my cool blue Christmas lights but no boom boom. Nothing. I will tell you I noticed when plugging the low level RCA jacks the jack itself seemed loose as well as the screwed in amp on the side. I thought for a minute about buying a 50 dollar amp and running it to this speaker but thought. ""I just did not get what I paid for!"" So back it goes to Amazon for a refund.Do not be tempted by this cheap price for a little boom boom. If the temptation it too great just send me your money and I will send you a letter and tell you got screwed. No difference."
4,blue view bass tube-amp,"i happy this already had the amp built in....the case and cover are both made with good materials, pretty standard to the industry, the blue ligght backer gives an awesome look to it, the volume could be a little better but the over all build is good, good for what it is, mostly an inexpensive sub....the wire connects are solid and clip easily."
1,Unreliable Product,"Although this all-in-one prints quality text, the paper feeder is erratic and gobs of ink accumulate on edges when paper is manually ""helped"" when feeding. I have only had this machine for a year (have not even connected or used fax yet) and I must replace it with a more dependable product. Agree with other reviewer that no cartridge will work if any other is empty, even if only needing black ink. Regardless of the quality of print, when working properly, it is absurd to regularly have to ""hand feed"" paper and then have to throw it out due to globs of ink poured onto sheets. The scanning process is very slow as well."
1,Epson Stylus CX5800F - Piece of JUNK!,"I've been a computer pro for 25 years and picked this printer up about a year ago. It's been one pain in the neck after another. The cartriges claim to put out over 300 pages, but never do. You can't run the printer if the black cartrige is empty. You need the manual to use the menus to set up faxing, etc. It's slow as can be, wastes ink on restarts as it ""cleans"" itself and takes forever to get ready to print. Once it is finally ready, go get a cup of coffee while your pages print. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. I've called Epson and got no satisfaction from them, just a run around."
1,Avoid This Printer! It Constantly Clogs - Wastes Expensive Ink,"I've owned several Epson printers, but this one may be the last. This printer constantly clogs and requires multiple cleaning cycles to get it printing decently again. This wastes both ink and paper. It usually takes at least 3 cleaning cycles to get acceptable output.I called Epson's support line and was told that there is nothing wrong with the printer and to continue to run the cleaning cycle as frequently as necessary. They were unwilling to do anything to help me. I was told that as long as I can eventually get the printer to work, it wasn't defective.I purchased this all-in-one to replace an HP unit my daughter took to college. I'd recommend an HP over the Epson - it was (and still is) trouble free."
1,What IDIOT designed this stupid product?,"What IDIOT designed this printer such that you have to replace ALL FOUR cartridges when any one of them runs out, regardless of whether they are full or empty? We hardly use the printer, and mostly print black and white text, but we notice that all three color cartridges become empty at exactly the same rate as the black cartridge and we have to replace all four cartrdiges each and every time. What a waste! Also, the copy function does not have the capability to adjust the copy ligher or darker. Again, what IDIOT designs a copier that you can't make lighter or darker? How could Epson put their brand name on such a poorly conceived product? I will never buy another Epson printer!!!!"
1,This printer is a piece of junk,"I used to really believe in the quality of Epson printers. They provided quick, good quality prints at an affordable price. Not anymore. I bought this for my parents in January and it never worked properly. Wouldn't turn off, computer would scan but not print, had to continually unplug the machine and restart it. Epson's concept of printing contact sheets and photos without a computer is the WORST idea ever. Process is cumbersome, tedious, wastes ink and paper, and basically doesn't work. I sent it back to Epson under warranty and they had the audacity to replace the new CX5800F with a refurb CX5800F. After 2 hours with tech support, the refurb would finally print. Next time I'm buying Canon."
1,Buy it and you will regret it!,"Bought this printer in 2006 from Officemax. At the time it seemed like a good idea. Now I have to rely on my 10 year old HP Deskjet half the time. Like many others have said you can not operate the printer if even 1 of the cartridges are deemed ""empty"". This printer constantly clogs and needs head cleaning. When it does work it is marginal at best. I guess the jokes on me, thanks Epson."
5,"Buy it, you won't be sorry.","This book has EVERYTHING you need ... and then some. When you think you're not going to need one of the forms in this book, you later realize that YOU DO! As a freelance artist, using these forms made me feel as though clients noticed that they were dealing with a real professional. Absolutely a great investment."
2,Needs to be updated.,"No InDesign files on CD and too many references to camera ready art in book.PDF files on CD do not have form fields.I'm disappointed, but at least it's a start."
4,Great forms! No fonts.,"I agree with other reviewers that the CD-ROM could use some help. My computer didnt have any of the fonts used with the forms which has caused me major problems trying to get the forms to print out as they look in the book. The fonts should have been included. Otherwise, the forms themselves have incredible potential."
2,Business and Legal Forms for Graphic Designers,"This was a great book that delivered on its promises! It arrived in exactly the condition described, and shipped right on time...I guess the only criticism I would have is the unsolicited Jesus propaganda that accompanied the book, signed by ""Cheryl""-- cheryl_neuroth2 --this is the first time that I have experienced this, and hopefully it will be the last.Not everyone who shops online is a heathen in need of ""saving"", and I can't help but feel a little insulted by the insinuation that my life needs direction to a higher calling in order to be complete..."
4,Really good instrument mic,"In my opinion this is a wonderful instrument mic. I bought it to mic my guitar cab and I didnt expect much from the price but I was amazed to what I got. It gave me almost the identical sound that came out of my amp. I also tried it on a acoustic guitar and sounded great. I've heard of people using it on snare drums but I've never tried it myself. Give this one a try, I think you'd like it."
4,A well written fantasy book,"I bought this book at a used bookstore. It is about two boys from our world who enter an old house. One thinks it is haunted. They find a tunnel in the floor, and accidentally wake an evil woman. They quickly run away, but later are captured and taken back. It turns out to be the world of Arkenvald. There are battles and everything. It is a really good book.William Andrews"
4,Praising the unexpected,"All the previous reviews are extensive and revealing about this very good book. Although i like to praise two thinks about it that impressed me.The first is the wonderfull way the author initialy explains to the reader the power and the importance of the script. The second is the chapter called ""The process of writing"" itself. This chapter is an unexpected powerfull gift to the aspiring screenwriter/director who has ideas or pictures and visualisations in his mind and wants to give them life in the form of a good script."
4,Good book with a slight pessimist POV,I like the overall value offered in this book and the coverage of topics is pretty nice. However I find the author is slightly pessimist or maybe pragmatic (who knows) and that is the biggest turnoff of this book. I hope if the author had written with a slight optimist POV it'd have been much better. Every one knows that the Film industry is pretty competitive but you don't have to be pessimist to convey the message.
3,A little discouraging,"A little discouraging...but helpful. I don't think it will take nearly as long to break into the industry as a writer/director as Rabiger suggests. I think Rabiger's view is more intended for those who want to make it big in the studio production side of directing...I would definitely recommend this book as a resource and I think anyone that wants to be a director should read it....but don't take to heart too much of his pessimistic attitude towards becoming a successful director. I think if you have talent and determination, you can supersede all that ""working in other areas of the industry to pay your dues B.S."" Read it with a grain of salt....extract what is helpful and ignore his jaded attitude."
2,Could the author please be more discouraging?,"This book is dense and filled with all sorts of self-important and sometimes useful information, but the overall tone made me consider writing a nasty letter to the author. Unfortunately, there is no one distinct chapter entitled ""You Probably Will Never Make It As A Director So Get Used to The Idea of Editor, Writer, or Gaffer,"" so you never know when some discouraging, negative, excitment-crushing comment will pop up. This book is not simply realistic in alerting the reader to the idea that the industry is a tough market, it makes directing sound impossible and you a giant fool for expecting to break into it. How about a little encouragement, Rabiger? Just because you didn't become a famous director yourself doesn't mean there aren't some talented future directors out there currently disguised as innocent victims of your wretched book."
2,Battery won't hold charge,"Milwaukee 0719-22 V28 Sawzall Lithium Ion Cordless Reciprocating Saw Kit from WELDFABULOUS thru Amazon. Delivery was prompt and apparent condition was good. The Charger was replaced by WELDFABULOUS since it would not charge either battery. The new charger, that arrived promptly, would only charge one battery, the other battery showed defective. I mailed back the one battery to Ben (507-494-5169) at WELDFABULOUS and he promptly sent a new battery. This ""new"" battery took a charge but once it was installed in the saw lasted about 10 sec. , then dead. (Tried it twice) I'm sending it back to Ben The saw with the good battery is no powerhouse but good enough considering it doesn't have a cord; but don't expect it to last more than 6 mins with a full charge when doing heavy cutting."
4,Outstanding Saw,"Purchased for residential use. I took down a 14x16 deck in an afternoon. Saw is extremely powerful. My only complaint is the batteries only last about 35 minutes of continuous heavy duty use. Saw came with two batteries, that charge in about an hour. I would rate five starts if the batteries either lasted longer, or were a little cheaper."
5,best sawzall a man can ever want,This is now my 3rd Milwaukee V28 sawzall I purchased. I have one that is 5 years old one three and now another new one. We carry one on every truck and remove hundreds of Catalytic converter's off the scrap cars we move every month. Never been let down once .These saws are the best in my opinion. Never had to service one of my V28 tools.
5,"Alarming, But Not Alarmist","Sometimes books like this have a tendency to overstate their claims in hyperbolic fits. Here, Mike Davis does an excellent job of describing the history and pathology of Avian Flu, without resorting to hyped up Hollywood plots. The reality is frightening enough and doesn't need to be magnified in any way. Although this book explains the scientific aspects of H5N1, it is not a difficult slog through incoherent jargon. If you want to know the nature of the Avian Flu Crisis, its likely impact, and the policies that got us here, this book is a good choice."
2,Davis presents a left wing view of the bird flu menace,"After some good basic information, we get conclusions that are nothing more than Bush and big pharma bashing. Mike Davis is Michael Moore in a lab coat."
5,"A Verra Guid Conclusion, Indeed!","Early this afternoon, I picked up a copy of Whence Came a Prince, and I have just finished reading it. I loved the first two books in the series, as well, but in this final installment, Liz Curtis Higgs has created a masterpiece. The book, rich with details about the beautiful Scottish land in which the story takes place, takes you on an emotional journey filled with love, grief, and hope. As the story of Jamie, Leana, and Rose draws to a close, you can't can't help feeling that you've been with them every step of their difficult journey. I highly recommend this rich, engaging story to anyone with a love for romance, historical fiction, and Biblical truths. But I do offer a warning--make sure to have tissues on hand!!"
5,Her best work yet!,"Whence Came a Prince kept my heart focused on trusting God during a difficult time of transition much like Leanna's. It's a powerful, well-written work. Liz just gets better and better."
3,Better Than The First Two Books In The Series,"I liked this book better than the first two in the series. A little less romance, more action. The first two books seemed to be the same story repeated - The characters were caught in the same unending cycle of poor decisions and control of Rose, Leana and Jamie by the girls' father. But this book went in a different direction, thank goodness. All the loose ends were tied up nicely and Lachlan got his comeuppance."
1,Disturbed,First of all I am writtig this under my husbands name.I was shocked to find these books in a Christain bookstore. Who would want to read books about a wimp of a man who gets one sister pregnant then marries the orher and gets her pregnant. Then takes the first sisters baby. After his wife dies marries the other sister who he has gotton pregnant again. I don't exactly think this book has anything to do with God's forgiveness. It is more like a worldly scottish soap opera.
2,Disappointing,"Book one was great, and I felt it followed the biblical story of Rachel and Leah quite well, but this book, book three in the series, it was just so off base with the biblical story. First of all, Rachel had two children by Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin. In this book, she cannot have children, but does become pregnant. Her children dont live! Why? Did Liz Curtis Higgs forget about the fact that Joseph and Benjamin did exist? Honestly, I hope that Grace in Thine Eyes is better than this one was. I was so disappointed with this book simply because I felt that it didn't do either character, Rose or Leana, justice at all."
5,Another great one from Liz Curtis Higgs!,"This is the third book in the series and I love it! I kind of know what's going to happen by this point, but it's still moving! I've cried more than once while reading them, but in a good way!"
1,Absolute Tripe. Do Not Purchase!,"This documentary should never have seen the light of day. I purchased a copy in advance of the release date, since I cannot get enough music or history about this pivotal figure of jazz and magnificent human being. But I learned absolutely nothing, and a newcomer will be put off by the subpar production values, including unprofessional editing and empty, boring, misleading, and erroneous historiography. This item should be removed from any responsible dealer's inventory...without delay!"
5,My grandson loves it.,"My grandson saw the performance of one of the songs on this tape on Sprout TV. For reasons unknown to me, he thought it was hilarious and couldn't understand why I couldn't just replay it for him. Being a doting grandmother, I went through every listing of Barney videos (hundreds!) until I found this one, which was the most likely candidate, although I couldn't be sure since the song titles aren't listed. I wish it had been a DVD instead of a VHS tape, but it was a good guess, it was here, and he loves it as much the 99th time as he did the first. (I still don't get it!)"
5,great information,Having suffered from rejection myself gives an educated look to the struggle that goes on in the inner man. Great read. Great spiritual insight.
5,Spiritual Warfare/Freedom from Oppression,This was a very good book. I bought it to see if there was anything in it that I may have missed in deliverance in my life. I gave the book to a friend and it helped her immensely. She found alot of stuff in her life that she could never figure out was explained in the book. Spiritual warfare is real. Dont let anyone deceive you regarding this area in your life. Demons will oppress and cause all kinds of problems. But praise God we have men & women such as Frank Hammond to cut through the confusion. READ THIS BOOK TO HELP YOU WALK IN FREEDOM THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS.
5,Die Welt Ist Schon Milord,"I have been looking for this for a long time for my wife. She is so happy with it.Using AMAZON was SO easy and I want to thank-you for making it so easy to work with your company. I will use this only in the future. THANKS again for a OUTSTANDING job and assistance.Harry Lath BergViernheim, Germany"
1,terrible,"this is definitely the worst of the warcraft book series...a large portion of the novel just doesnt feel like it belongs in the warcraft universe... the method with which the differing races communicate, their approach towards each other, it feels like it was written by a child... like a 5th grade project or something... terrible"
3,Give it a read,"For people who play WoW or just like a different type of adventure book, this is a great idea. It's not the top of my to read list but it's a good start for my first WoW book."
1,Not Impressed,"Some of the characters were well written, but I did not enjoy the story, it was too simple. There was no unpredictable twist. I really just didn't like it, and I have nothing else to say because it was too simple of a story to really get deep into."
1,Please! LOL,"All I can say, is like the...""people""??? ( well some i suppose, most are desensitized pigs...Just a opinion and you know how opinions are, we all have them, so...get over it or not...lol) The Book, is as you would expect! Full of self glory feeling crap..."
2,One of the worst books I've read,"Forcing the Alliance and Horde to be enemies once again was a poor decision in my opinion. I really wish that World of Warcraft had continued the story with them working toward peace with something else instead of once again pitting them against one another. This really hurt the story in my opinion, and this book suffered because of it.The story wasn't very well written, but that could be due to it being an afterthought after the game was released."
5,World of Warcraft: Cycle of Hatred,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was an easy read, with a good plot. If you are looking for a book with a lot of World of Warcraft history, you won't find it in this book. What you will find is a good fantasy story set in the World of Warcraft universe involving ""big name"" characters."
4,Good History,"Excellent history of the Warcraft world and why things are the way they are, especially the relationship between Orcs, Humans and Draenei"
4,A good read,"This was a good book, and well worth reading, but I didn't like it as much as the other Warcraft Novels."
4,DeCandido Suprised me,"It's a good book. Its not great, but it's well worth the money and the time that you will put into reading it. The characters are fairly engaging and it is very interesting to know why the horde and the alliance are so upset with each other. I used to gank a level 40 troll simply because it was fun. To some extent, I now feel obligated to kill every hordie that forgot to turn off his /pvp. It's a good read if you are into the World of Warcraft. However, if you just enjoy the immense lore of the WOW universe, it may leave you a little unimpressed but still happy with the purchase."
2,i have noticed no anabolic efect,"Have been eating the capsules for few weeks, and have noticed no changes. Ive been working out alongside taking tablets, taken the prescribed dose, 2capsules twice a day. its a waste of money"
1,Do not purchase this product,"Do not order this product. The wording is a combination of two products. The information includes information from both the America's Game DVD and info from the NFL's 3 DVD set. The picture is of the NFL's 3 DVD set, but the product you receive is the $19.99 America's Game DVD which you just paid the $35 price. I returned the product and Amazon will not refund my money. So I have no DVD and am out of the full amount of money. Amazon has been informed of the problem with the description of the item and as of this writing has not changed the info."
2,Picture doesn't represent item purchased,"I was really excited when I placed this order but didn't read other reviews until it was already shipped and I knew I was going to receive the wrong item. It is really disappointing that Amazon hasn't taken care of this situation when I was told they would. One positive, I did get my refund!"
1,PRECAUTION! False article.,"The article is false. It does not correspond to the article that really amazon sends. It corresponds to the title: America's Games: 1999 St. Louis Rams. In addition the price to this article is smaller, approximately half."
2,Stud Fell out!,"When buying this watch I asked the girl behind the counter if the studs around the face of the watch were under to warrenty and she said no, but that she had hers for a while and none had fallen out. I figured ok I'll give it a try because it is a beautiful watch. I had it for less then 48hrs and a stud already fell out. Atleast its within the 30day return policy. But as much as I love the look of the watch I will not be exchanging it. I'll have to find another one were the studs are covered. DO NOT BUY if you plan to wear it daily!"
3,"Good idea, but...","I've been looking at cookbooks for people with allergies to dairy, soy, eggs and nuts. I was excited by the title of this book, but after looking at many of the recipes (especially in the dessert section) I was disappointed. The author calls for margarine in many of the soy-free recipes--but as far as I know a soy-free margarine does not exist.I recommend the cookbook ""150 Vegan Favorites."" Solomon has many soy-free, healthy and exciting recipes."
2,Redundant information,"I did not care much for this book. The recipes provided can be found in any cookbook dealing with allergies, and there was only a limited number of allergenic foods for which recipes were given. However, there is some useful information given in the book that would be helpful to a person just beginning to manage food allergies. Also, there is a little information on how to manage allergies naturally, through chiropractic manipulation. The reason I only gave this book a 2-star rating is that the average chiropractor will not know the techniques used, but of course one can always purchase the videos advertised in the book explaining to one's chiropractor how to do these tests and manipulations. I feel that if an author is going to present information in a book, one should not have to pay extra (by buying videos) to get the information needed."
4,Childhood Favorite,I am very happy to see my childhood favorite cartoon come to DVD. And they play very well.
3,"Stylish, poor quality","This is one of those very stylish products that is extremely poorly made, and poor customer service too. It looks great, but the screw-on legs do not screw in straight. They also do not all screw in to the same depth, so the whole thing wobbles. When I contacted the manufacturer for replacement legs for the two worst ones, they told me they would send them and never did. Fortunately my dogs do not move it around a lot, so it works for me."
3,The Screen Test Is Worth It,"As a bonus feature, the DVD has the screen tests of both Bruce Willis and some guy that network wanted. It's fascinating to watch them both perform the same scenes - both without Cybill Shepherd (another actress stood in for Cybill). Watch it once without commentary and then again with Willis and Glenn Gordon Caron critiquing everything."
4,No Way!!,There's no way I would pay more than $20 for this dvd. I will wait to purchase this. Just like all dvd's this will be released again and with a new digitally remastered transfer. The prices for this is bordering on robbery. Just my 2 cents.
4,Jump starting the double entendre,"Fifteen years after I wanted to be David Addison and realized I could only watch David Addison, they release the Pilot on DVD. I want to be David again but my wife won't let me! Seriously- the highlight of the DVD, which is not one of my favorite episodes (Atomic Shakespeare) is the audio commentary with Glenn Caron and Bruce Willis. They share fond memories of working on Moonlighting, and remind us how, culturally speaking, huge the show was. They also comment on other episodes, guest stars, and make a list of THEIR favorite episodes. And Bruce tells nice stories about the fourth season! The only problem is the audio commentary disappears for a long time during the last twenty minutes. I wanna know how they filmed all that stuff on the clock!"
5,Hell on High Heels,"The chemistry between ""Maddie"" and ""David"" is classic, like Tracy and Hepburn. My teenagers and I used to tape every episode, they were so witty. Please, put the whole series on DVD. It's an instant seller of a classic madcap comedy.A New England viewer"
3,"Looks great! , Could sound better","Well, a bruce willis classic has been released on DVD. The whole Pilot has been remastered but I was disepointed that the sound was in MONO. Other than that, you can also choose the see some very rare Bruce Willis Sreentests which he has a lot of hair on! and also a screentest with another guy who odetioned for the role of ""David Addison"" who I've never seen in my life! and Plus , it was great to hear Bruce Willis and Glen Caron's thoughts about the pilot and the series in the audio commentary. Defenatly for a Bruce Willis Or a ""Moonlighting"" fan to add to their collection!"
3,Okayish..,I got this bag free with a Kenneth Cole watch.. So I am not really particular about its quality. I would say it is not great but OK for normal use. Don't expect too much. I personally would not pay 35 bucks for it.
4,Nice little bag,I got this as part of a Kenneth Cole promo and it has been wonderful. Not very big but sleek and well made.
4,fun puzzle,"It's good to have something fun to teach my kid about Noah's Ark and the story behind it. I have had fun putting the puzzle together with my toddler. However, my tot doesn't seem to be crazy about it compared with other jigsaw puzzles she has. I am not sure if she has the same reason as I do. I thought that floor puzzle with big puzzle pieces will be fun but I do have second thought now. With big puzzle pieces, I just can't get a quick global view of all the puzzle pieces of the puzzle within a small area. But it's still a good quality product."
4,HART to Hart,We liked this Movie very much! So sad about Lionel Stander (Max). Nice to see some of Montreal that we adore!
3,Pretty Good.,"Above average Godzilla movie. It starts out a little slow, but once the monsters wake up it clips along. Godzilla is sitting on fence in this outing, half-way between the destruction of previous movies and the defender of humanity in latter ones. Ghidrah is the best Toho monster after Godzilla, and looks his best here. Rodan and the larva Mothra show up, along with the twins. Only one singing number. The human side of the plot is above average. Overall, an above average but not great Godzilla movie. See it before the inferior Monster Zero, its sequel."
3,war of the monsters,"good entertaining monster movie featuring ghidrah in his first appearnce and quite impressive! the part's where the monster's talk too one another while the faries translate what they are saying is very stupid though. godzilla, rodan and mothra go up against the dragon in a exciting grudgematch but the scenes with the cop trying to save the princess annoyingly interrups the action, so fast foward through those scenes."
2,This movie is boring at times.,"Well, the title explains it. The title is extremely pointless. Why? Why? Why? Why did Toho have to make such a stupid film???! There are some changes they should have made. First, aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second, Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs, heads, and wings uncontrolably! And third, MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb. In the later movies, Godzilla acts more like Barney than a giant monster."
2,Warning - annoying problems!,"Love this camera EXCEPT for two huge things:It takes forever between shots if the flash is going, we miss sooo many good shots because of this. I don't know if this is ""normal"" but I do know that this is ""unacceptable""! The delay is often several seconds.Also, it runs through batteries like there's no tomorrow if you use regular AA's, and the good NiMH ones aren't good enough either.These are major pains. The camera otherwise is very good, solid, takes nice photos, etc. But missing so many shots and constantly having to replace the batteries means I'm looking for a new camera even though this one is still working. I regret this purchase."
4,LOVED IT !!!,i loved this book. i am catholic and have always been fascinated and a bit afraid of the devil possesion thing. this book tells the perspective from a catholic priest who has down alot of research on the subject and also was an advisor for the original exorcist movie. i have read other books like malachi martins hostage to the devil which is also very good. if you like this subject read this book. also has real exorcism rites and prayers at the end of the book
2,Warning: This is a LIVE recording!,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy live shows. And, from what I can tell, it is the original artists singing their stuff. What disappointed me was that nowhere on the album cover or description, does it let you in on this basic fact that it's a compilation of live versions. The quality of the recording is fine and if you love re-living any concerts you'd been to, this is the CD for you. It's a great mix of well-known and good but forgotten songs. If you are looking for EXACTLY the same song you hear on the radio, however, keep looking."
5,Fun fishing,"My two year old loves this game. She doesn't exactly play it how it was intended but I am sure that will come with time. She loves using the magnetized poles to pick up all the fish and put them in a bowl. Then she goes through and puts all the pieces back. It is pretty neat because the fish,shark,seahorse and crab come in four different colors and to return the pieces to the correct place you have to not only match the correct shape but also the correct color. I was amazed she was able to figure it out. The only draw back with the game is that there isn't a way to store the poles with the board so I rigged a piece of stick velcro to the bottom and that has seemed to keep them together. I am sure when she gets older she will also love playing the game as intended but in the mean time she sure is enjoying and refining her fine motor skills. I am definitely happy with this purchase."
5,The Finest of Fine Art Nudes,"I have been a Fine Art Photographer for 35 years photographing mainly nudes. I am VERY opinionated in this arena. Most books of fashion models posing nude are little more than curiosities. People like to see famous/beautiful people nude in exotic locations and yes there is that here in ""Woman"". And while it may not fulfill the pretentious title, the photography is exceptional through out! I have not seen a book of this quality in years. Anyone interested in this area of Fine Art Photography has to purchase this book."
5,Best of the serals,"Honorable men vs. pure evil. Plenty of action, motorcycles, airplanes, fighting the bad guys, etc, but over and above that you come to care what happens to the characters. The last chapter will not disappoint. I discovered this serial in 1949, and never forgot it. Showed it to my kids (in 16mm) in the 70's and last year to my grandkids. Nobody was disappointed. Buy it and enjoy."
5,Fairy Tales Retold Barney-Style,"I'm 19 years old and bored by most Barney episodes but this one has to be the exception.In case you haven't figured out already, the words ""Once Upon a Time"" prompt a visit from Stella the Storyteller. Her suitcase of props explodes and Barney, Baby Bop, Carlos, Kristen, Shawn, and Tosha help her repack it. While doing this, the costumed children and dinos act out (in this order): Rumpelstiltskin, Rapunzel, and Goldielocks and the Three Bears.Like all the Barney videos, this one has songs. My favorites are ""The Spinning Wheel"", ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith"", ""Castles So High,"" and ""Does Your Hair Hang Low"". (This is the order the songs are sung in.)I have watched this video several times, and it holds my interest till the end."
1,For Some Reason.. this video scared my 21 month old son,"My 21 month old son watches Barney all the time. We own dozens of tapes! Once Upon A Time is our most recent Barney purchase. Five minutes into tape, when Stella the Story teller came on... My son started shaking, crying and grabbing me. He was truly scared! He has seen Stella in many other videos and has never had a reaction like that! He usually enjoys her. I immediately took the tape out and later that day tried again. Same reaction, only stronger! I put in another Barney video featuring Stella the Story Teller (Time for Counting) and he had no problem... danced and laughed along like always. I must say, that I found nothing scary about the tape but since my son is a true Barney fan, I figure that something is not right. I will not show this tape again and do not recommend it to other parents."
5,Old but SO usefull,"This is an old book, been around for years, but it is still one of the best for authentic methods of making Native American items. This is replacing one I had years ago and learned so much from. A must for my library."
5,Wonderful!,"We received the book promptly and were very happy with it! It had some really cool projects and lots of additional information, as well as pictures. Very interesting and informative and we couldn't be happier!"
3,Love This Color,"Love the color, but no way this is a 1x-3x (and the panties are ridiculously small, more like a size 7 or 8)"
2,you get what you pay for,you get what you pay for. It was cheap and itchy. would not buy again if given the chance.
2,Very Itchy & Small!,I got this in red and black because it looked so good on the picture. The size runs very small. If u get this 2 pc; make sure that u get a size or two larger. I am a XL and it only came to the top of my pubic bone. Runs short and I'll wear it as a camosoile; after I wash it a couple of times!
3,It was OK at best,I had ordered a halter item similar to this one a few months ago but decided to try this one out. It is overly short on mybody. I'm a plus size woman and it is a bit small-- I weigh 235-- and im 5ft 7 and the halter model fit me nicely. I do HATE putting my weight in here but what the heck... I just want to help other women ordering it. So ladies. Order the halter design one AND NOT THIS ONE. best wishes!
1,HUGE!!,"This little number came in the mail and was huge on me. I thought it would work because the model is thin. The straps were the only part of it that actually touched my body, and of course, I could not return it because it came with panties. Usually I can make things work, but this was a mess. It looked like a lace garbage bag."
3,A Tight Fit,"The ad says ""plus sized"", not quite. Still worked for what I wanted though. Thanks for getting it to me so fast!"
2,Not Plus size,This item does not run true to size. It's says PLUS size but looks more like a large ! Material was as stated but size was way off!
1,ummm,I liked the product but was not pleased with how long it took to get in the mail.I ordered it Dec 7 and didn't get it till after christmas.
5,Real Pearls Of Wisdom -- Sans Fortune Cookie Overtones,"If ever there was a philosophical work worth reading, this is it. The lessons in The Art Of Warfare can be applied to myriad contexts that have nothing to do with conflict just as well as they can be applied to the context for which they were written. Ames' judicious use of background information and supporting footnotes leaves interpretation to the reader (where it belongs) and his translation is completely devoid of any Charlie Chan-esque dialogue. Covering everything from morale to logistics to leadership, Master Sun's discourses are not just a guide to effective warfare -- they are a guide to effecting success."
4,"Good bowls, but could be heavier if intended for use by big dogs","These bowls are sturdy plastic and fit great in our dishwasher. I thought they would be a heavier resin, but they may be a more hollow plastic. So far, they've worked fine with our labradors, so they should be able to withstand use by most dogs."
5,good dish,"The disk is solid, washes easily. Excellent price as compared to even Walmart. Recommend without reservation. Works very well outside."
3,"Not what I expected, but still good.","For some reason, I expected the three dog dishes I ordered to be ceramic; I guess because they're called crock dishes. So I was disappointed when I received plastic dishes. The color in the picture also is incorrect. Although the dishes appear to be off white, they're really more on the grey side w/black dots, which doesn't exactly go well with my flooring.That said, I kept them because ceramic dishes are too costly, and these dishes serve the purpose. I believe a better description would have avoided disappointment on both the material and the color, and also would have made me decide against ordering them."
2,Disappointed,"These are not original artists. All are somewhat mellow renditions with big orchestra sound. If you've seen the movie or TV show, you would remember the gritty drama the song conjures up. Unfortunately, these don't do it for me. There was no way to know at the time, from this or any other listing, that these are not by the original artists. I am disappointed. True Western fans should try another selection. If you want soft background music this might work."
4,A little too challenging,"Many (most) of the puzzles are Thursday/Friday puzzles, with only a few Mon/Tues, which can be a little difficult for some solvers who haven't mastered the late week puzzles yet! But still fun, and clever :)"
5,United States Military Band,"If you like concert band music, and marches especially, then you will love these CDs. I have been a musician in concert bands for over 40 years and the United States Military Bands are the epitomy of excellent concert bands. I just wish there were more military concert band CDs like this available. My only complaint is the the Army's concert band was not included on these cds. I would highly recommend purchasing these if you enjoy this kind of music."
3,the yorkshire ripper,A good factual book written by a journalist who was involved very much with the police and fed off their briefings. I understand his father was a senior policeman. I have used much of his text to show that the police got the wrong man and in fact deliberately framed a mentally disturbed man. See my site www.yorkshireripper.co.uk for the full story as experienced by someone who had close relations with the real ripper.
5,Good,"A very good text book. I have it and read through it. It gives you an introduction to OS. Very easy to read, and very easy to understand. Once you have built up your knowledge, you can start to read more advanced books."
1,Not the best book on Operating Systems,"I bought this book because it was the prescribed text book for my course. Each chapter is unnecessarily lengthy and the Authors fail to explain most of the concepts clearly. I am surprised why a lot of the Universities prescribe this book over others. If your intentions are just about passing your OS course, then this book might just come handy. But if you are intended to learn actually how stuff works, then there are tons of better books on this subject, try them before falling a prey for this book.In my opinion, ""Operating Systems"" by William Stallings is way better. Stallings explains each, and every concept very clearly and with just the right amount of text(no verbal diarrhea as in the case of this book). You might also want to check out the book by Gary Nutt."
2,Good book but way too difficult to read.,"This was a required text for a university OS course. The book was very through in the number of topics it covered. However, I found the way the book was written to be very long winded and difficult to understand. I found myself searching on-line most of the time to find supplemental information. Even on basic concepts I had already read about in the book just so I could fully understand most of the topics. I still have the book today and have found it to be a useless reference. There is absolutely nothing clear and to the point anywhere in this book."
3,Galvin or Stallings ??..I suggest both.,"No matter what how much a book conveys, when you hear it from you prof. the concept is all the more easier to understand and apply.I used this book and the OS book by William Stallings for my OS course this semester and I would say that it would be profitable to read selected chapters from both.For instance,Distributed Systems and protection are widely dealt with in this book,enough for an introductory course to OS concepts.But the book contains too much of theortical information.The diagrams in William Stallings book made more sense to me in understanding concepts like RAID.You look at the picture and thats enough.The concept just eases into your mind.My prof. expertly presented the best from both books and I think that helped me learn the subject more easily.So if you ask me,grab a copy of both books and take the best out of each.Happy reading."
2,concepts overwhelmed by words,I had a class in Operating System. I found this book so full of unusefull details that the concepts are completely drowned. I found myself always trying to understand what was really importand and what was details. I think this book could be great with 1/3 of the words actually used. Now I have on the shelf using it as a reference...
2,Confusing Book,"Its great for giving a brief illustration of topics, but additional books or references are necessary to get a grasp of what's being discussed. Too Wordy to the point where you may get confused."
3,"Covers a great deal, but poorly organized.","The book was exhausting to read and quite frankly would be a mystery without other sources to help understand the material. Though it covers a full spectrum of concepts and various examples of OSes, the authors tend to use technical terms without explanation as to their meaning. In short they haven't carefully considered their audience. Highly recommend Understanding the Linux Kernel as an easier read and covers many of the same topics, even touching on non-Linux approaches."
4,Nice form factor,This book has very nice dimensions. It fits in my hands quite nicely and can be read comfortably in any position. Well done!
2,Poorly Written,This book will bore you to tears. I am sure most of the material is accurate (although I found 1 error). I fall asleep within the first few minutes of picking it up almost every time. Perfect book to read to your kids to put them to sleep.
2,Not worth the money,"I can't begin to understand how anyone can say this book gives ""detailed information"". It is an extremely high level look at operating systems.I understand that for a typical under-grad OS class, there isn't time to go into deep details. But for 125+/- dollars, I expect to have something a little deeper I can research out of class.Any engineer that is even half-way serious about what they do will be disappointed in this book. If your professor requires this book, there is a good chance they aren't worth listening to. In fact mine simply just played the 'intructor slides' that come with this book. They mirror the book content almost exactly; which makes for an amazing waste of time. (Unless you can't read, I suppose)I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 because it _will_ give you a good overview, but for 125USD you should be able to get something with real meat. This book should cost < 75. I imagine the reason it is so expensive is that there are 3 authors to pay."
3,Decent,"The book is fine except:1. The chapter on semaphore and monitor is nearly impossibleto understand. Unless you're a mad scientist, you arebetter off by skipping this chapter and go to the beachinstead.2. The book is based on theory only. There is no programminginvolved, which makes it somewhat impractical."
3,This book bridges the gap between the RTOS type OS' and desktop/server OS',Multi-processor and 'heavy' OS' aren't well represented in the embedded system documentation. I needed to bridge the gap so I could hack a larger 'heavy' OS so it would have more deterministic event handling. This book brought to light many aspects of OS' that were present in the heavy OS's code and weren't well documented. I like this book for this purpose.
3,Operating System,"I bought this book because it was required for my class. I have used it both for getting a general understanding of concepts and for finding more in depth explanations. The book has some nice examples written in C++ and Java so that interested students can get a better feel for what is going on behind the scenes. Additionally, each chapter has review questions and project questions. The review questions were harder than I expected because they were not simple skim-the-book type problems. Rather it requires some serious thought and a broader understanding of what is going on in the chapter. I found this a refreshing change from textbooks I have read in the past.The book also has some nice little projects that an ambitious student could take on; for example, writing your first process in a customized Linux kernel. All in all I say the book is a good buy and will likely earn a place on my book shelf once the quarter is over."
5,GREAT!,"Wow!! I borrowed a copy from a friend thinking I would look at a few concepts.... couldnt put the book down, I had to get my own copy."
2,Dry and Bland,I think the book has potential but it is a dry subject. Very boring. If you can make it past the first half of the book it gets better but is still pretty dry. It is definitely not a beginners book and unless you really need to know the internals of an operating system (like those who program the operating system) don't waste your time.
3,"Straightforward, some gaps","This is a decent book on the subject, but a number of the explanations are insufficient and required clarification from the professor."
3,"A fair book, not great",If you are looking for a discussion of Win98 or Win95 or any modern operating system you won't find it in this book. Most concepts are presented clearly. However the authors prefer to use Pascal which is a real detriment to understanding. This was probably a good book when it was written but it is now seriously outdated.
2,don't buy it,too much repeated and unhelpful words that kill lots of trees and time. just fail getting to the point in a neat way
2,XP Update not worth it!,"Almost bought this in the store until I noticed there were case studies for both Win2K and WinXP. These are very similar operating systems and, sure enough, the text for the chapters is exactly the same for most of these two chapters. I do not understand why interesting operating systems [FreeBSD, Mach] were left online in order that these two redundant chapters could be printed. Were it not for my familiarity with previous editions, I would assume the authors knew very little about OS concepts if they thought that covering 2K and XP would provide two distinct case studies for comparison. In short, the 2K coverage should have been replaced by one of the online chapters."
5,Great Book,"Although I had to buy this book for a class, I do enjoy reading it. The book stays current by focusing on modern multi-core processors, and relating most concepts to Linux, Windows, and Solaris (plus sometimes others) operating systems. It is fairly easy to read, and there are programming exercises at the end of each chapter to highlight concepts. This book will definitely get your feet wet when learning operating system concepts."
5,Among the best operating systems texts for its' time,"Many years ago, I was contacted by a desperate department head in need of someone to teach operating systems. With only two weeks to go before the class started, he was beginning to suffer from a case of the jitters. I agreed to teach the class and this was the book that had already been selected for the course.Through the course of the class, I never had any reason to complain about the selection. I found the material well presented and while I had to do the usual explanation and clarifications in class, there was nothing that I considered beyond the norm. The coverage was thorough and when I needed to select exercises for the students, I took them directly from the book and only occasionally modified them to emphasize a particular point.After examining other operating systems texts, I still consider this one among the best, at least for its' time."
4,few concepts confusing but overall excellent!!,"Excellent book for beginners. I enjoyed reading it, but i noticed that there are many repeated paragraphs throughout the text. This makes exam studies tedious."
2,Boring,This is the only textbook we used for our OS class at university. My interests lie in systems programming and some low-level interfacing using high level languages but this book really didn't help me much. I was looking forward to this subject but disappointed because the lecturer basically took this book as the bible and made no references to other sources. If this book was to create a religion and my lecturer was the pope then I wouldn't be surprised if there were so many factions like in Christianity...because of the confusing presentation of the subject. Half of the time I was consulting Google because of the nearly useless examples in the book. At one point I was arguing about a vaguely explained topic with my lecturer. I was using other texts as my references but unfortunately my lecturer was pushing his own interpretation of the topic.
4,Great book for CS courses!,"After reading a portion of this book from a friend in a 300 level CS course, I found that this book explains everything in a way that I can understand it within a reasonable amount of time. Silberschatz and Gavin did a great job with this book. I understand the concepts fully."
2,"Pretty useless book, but required for classes","I bought the book because it was required for class. Only provides very high level insight into any aspect of operating systems. Sure, buy it for a class, but if you're looking for an OS book to read on the side, pick something else."
4,Very good start for O/S's,"This book attempts to be a generic introduction to operating systems, and therefore never really gets super deep. It covers most of the basic tenents of how the O/S works, but generally demonstrates trivial solutions while only hinting at how real production systems handle the problems raised, but hey, this is an intro text. The first few chapters did seem more indepth to me, but it could just be that I had a fairly high understanding of the material by the time I reached the end. I do think it could have better illustrated the differences between Windows and the various *nix's, but it tried, and there was not an obvious bios for or against any particular O/S."
3,a very confusing book,"This book is OK for its first few pages of each chapter, i.e. the intro part, you (an undergraduate ) can use to get a brief understanding of some basic concepts, but if you want to really understand something thouroughly, this is a very bad book, for example, the proof of the mutual exclusion algorithms in Chapter 7 is very clumsy and confusing, it's actually easier to look at the code and reason yourself.for most of the deeper reasoning about the alorithms in the book, it's much better to read the original papers.some of the sentences in Chapter 7 seem to be copied without much effor by the author from original papers.probably the 3 reasons you can use this book is(1) the simple intro part(2) the code in the book is simplified and probably uses more meaningful mnemonics than those in original paper ( not exactly, for some, it's even more weird !!)(3) use it as a bibliography to the papers, which , you really should read for understanding"
4,"""theme is particularly beautiful and deeply romantic""","In the liner notes, Mark Isham states - ""I wrote themes, not for individual characters, but for points in the story. There was a theme for their love scenes - a breakup theme - a theme that I developed to underscore the two people discussing things that were important to them...I composed music to reflect interior states, the specific cognitions which Virgil experienced"".Opening theme is particularly beautiful, deeply romantic. The music speaks mostly with piano and strings, with underscore - ""OUR EYES AREN'T WHAT MAKE US SEE"", reaching the high excitement of - ""A SEEING JOURNEY"", with the sadness and brooding ' ""YOU DON'T SEE ME"".The closing - ""LOVE IS WHERE YOU ARE"" sung by Diana Krall in the film and Gigi Worth on the album is so tender and a responsive melody. The song tugs at your heart-strings giving you that ache just before it is broken.Total Time: 49:34 on 15 Tracks/ Milan Records - 73138 35869 2 (1998)"
5,THE THIRD TIME'S A CHARM!,"After three attempts, Alec Baldwin, the narrator has put some life into the characters that was missing from his earlier efforts on ""Cranky Bugs"" and ""Races and Rescues."" As the editorial review suggests, this video is scarier and more suspenseful than earlier Thomas stories, so I don't consider it suitable for children under 5. ""Spills and Chills"" introduces a new character, Boulder, a big round rock with a pouty face that is probably the most clever Thomas character yet. ""Spills and Chills and Other Thomas Thrills"" would be a fine addition to your Thomas video library."
5,Spills and Chills and Other Thomas Thrills,"Thid is a good video. In this video, Alec Baldwin does a wonderful variety of voices. Even though some moments are sort of scary, it is a good video.The story stops are:Toby's DiscoveryRusty and the BoulderDuncan Gets SpookedStepney Gets LostHaunted HenrySir Topham Hatt's HolidayThe Music Video:""Every Cloud has a Silver Lining"""
2,Good Stories and Horrible Stories all in one video!,"This video does have some decent stories on it, like Duncan Gets Spooked, but there are also some of the worst episodes of Thomas & Friends on it too. Rusty and the Boulder for example has a boulder with a mind of its own chasing the little engines, ending up crashing into a shed and bursting into a fireball. The narration by Baldwin is ok, but it could be better."
2,Bringing FX to children's videos....,"The stories in this video are definitely ""creepier"" than in others - more suited for Halloween, it seems. And, the crash/smash/blow it up that is so prevalent in most action adventure movies has finally infiltrated the Thomas series. The producer must have been trying to figure out how s/he could bring in special effects in all the stories, and it is a bit tiresome. My 4-yr old isn't as interested in this video as he is in the others in the series. Alec Baldwin makes Sir Topham Hatt sound way too serious all the time, and while he's added a variety of voices to the characters, he's got a limited range. George Carlin was definitely easier to listen to. You can tell these stories were written by TV writers and not by Rev. Awdry. Be prepared to explain to younger children why Boulder has a face sometimes (when Rusty imagines it); and that not all trains fall off their tracks into raging rivers when going over high bridges!"
1,Thomas is NOT supposed to be scary!,"My husband and I have relied on Thomas the Train videos to be ""safe"" for toddlers. So we were astonished at this one. WHY did the writers think that making a spooky video would be beneficial to their young audience!?! Halfway through the third story we stopped it. Our 3 1/2 year old son said it was scary. Needless to say, this one ended up in the trash. Next time we will not assume that Thomas is harmless."
2,NOT THOMAS,Thomas has always been a good video set but these epasoides were to scary for my brother and sister it has very scary stuf in like a boluder almost crushed rusty ducans driver and fireman play a nasty prank on him a engine falls of a bridge fog is in every story expect the last to nasty desials arry and bert almsot scrap stypney and have frighting voices the backrounds are vary dark and a seed bruns down i dont think its ment for younger kids it relly scary for them buy another video like thomas cristmas wonderland or new friends for thomas they or better then this
2,NOT THOMAS,Thomas has alwasy been a nice sires of video for childer with lots of fun every video has to foter or 6 or 7 storeis.BUT in this video is extremly frighting for young viewers they countain crash sceans buldings calopseing buldings engines falling of bridges bolders almost squishs rusty ducans driver and fireman play a mean prank on him scary backrounds arry and bert almost scrap stypney and have frighting voices fog is almost in every almost all the stories and a tarabile fire.It scared my little brother and sister so much they havent watch it agian but they only watched the last stories and the song so im waring you i think it was more for older childer if you ask me should be pg to warn pepole about the frighting content buy some other video like trust thomas or sing along and stories they or much more sutabile for younger childer
2,The Very Frustrating Frog,"I was disappointed to find out how difficult it was to try and assemble the frog pieces. The soft plastic parts are hard to put together. They do not fit securely and keep falling apart, and as if this was not frustrating enough, the final hard plastic part just did not fit the rest of the assembled frog and we had to just put it on top without snapping it into place, as there was no way to do it as instructed. The idea is excellent, but unfortunately the kit is not up to it, and is a source of frustration for children as well as for the parents trying to help. Poorly made and very disappointing. I hope they will improve the product because its educational value is exceptional."
1,Terrible!,"This toy was so frustrating, the pieces wouldn't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up. This was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly. In the end, it looked like a pile of cloudy lime Jello with plastic bones sticking out of it. I would not reccomend this toy."
3,It had some value,"We were able to use this product once with success. I let my 8-year-old son put the plastic pieces together -- and the other reviewers are right, they don't snap together well . I made the gel and poured it in. We made a pretty neat frog that set quickly. My son had fun dissecting it. When I tried the next mold though (they give enough solution for 2), it congealed into a big glob that never made it into the mold. I'm not sure what I did differently from the first time. I don't recommend it, unless you might like to try using a jello-based solution. Even then, I'm not sure. It might be too runny to stay in the mold. There are real dissection kits available through home science companies that allow dissection of a real preserved frog. My kids found it much more interesting and educational."
4,Only get it if you have money to burn,"It's a great box set and all, but honestly the cd's really arn't that different from the originals. Sure the sound quality is improved and it plays louder on your sterio, but that's about it. The best reason I've found for owning it is for the tribute cd.So if you're a hardcore Iced Earth fan it's a good buy. Other wise just wait for the tribute cd to be released on it's own..."
5,******************** 20 STAR ESSENTIAL ICED RATING!!!,"Has all original CD artowrk that was meant to be on the releases but wasn't, the very RARE Enter The Realm demo which got them signed and cannot be bought anywhere else, a full color book containing the entire history of Iced Earth, all discs remastered with the sound they were meant to have, and the KILLER cover CD, Tribute To The Gods, containing the best covers I've heard in years. Oh yeah ... IT'S ICED EARTH! Need I say more? * 20 STAR ESSENTIAL RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB! THE BEST BOX SET SINCE AC/DC'S BONFIRE! Cheers."
5,Very cute! Runs a little big but nothing a safety pin can't fix.,I wore this as my Halloween costume. My boyfriend and I went as Bonnie and Clyde and was this costume ever a hit! I had to put in a safety pin where it Velcros behind my neck so it didn't sag too low but overall for the price it was a really cute costume. I'll definitely wear it again.
3,"Good, but too old pictures","I bought this book as a gift for my Host Family in Minnesota, USA , when I went there as a foreign exchange student. The book is good, and tells a lot about Norway, but for a book being marked as printed in 2000, the pictures are really old. I would say some of the pictures in this book looks like they are from the 80's. One example is the Royal Family, where the Crown Prince looks like he is around 11-12 years old. He is now in his 20's and engaged. But the nature still looks the same, so if you don't care too much about pictures, you can buy this book."
3,Not an independent toy if you want to use it correctly.,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas when she was 2.PROS:Independent play is possible if they are merely using it as a puzzle, but if you actually want them to learn their numbers and what number comes next not so good.CONS:The 6 and the 9 and not distinguishable and the 9 can fit in the whole for the 6 but the 6 CANNOT fit in the whole for the 9 so it confuses her at times especially if 9 is the last piece she has left and there's only one whole left open. They should have either made the 6 and 9 totally interchangeable or not let the 6 fit in the 9 whole at all."
3,good puzzle,got the puzzle for my 3 year old to help learn and associate numbers. I wish the numbers were more defined to pop out more what number they are but over all it helps and she likes to do the puzzle. I also do not care that some numbers of the same number are different colors and confuses her easily wish all the 3s were one color and so forth but different colors because she tends to get frustrated that they don't match or when I have to fix them so I can go over the numbers to teach her the number with out the 1 and the 3 in the 13 are two different colors. I have to fix it so they are the same color so they stand out that they go together. Still and ok puzzle
1,TOTAL PIECE,This came in a million little pieces to be assembled - come on! Don't waste your money. For this amount of money you can do better.
5,The parts about men are dead on,"I actually agree with all the reviewers, because the book has some priceless knowledge about how women should deal with men (sexually and otherwise) but it also has tonnes of nonsense in it. The key is to be able to take the good and leave the bad. The intoduction, and chapters 1, 5 and 6 are essential information for any women who has or wants a relationship with a man. There is plenty here, like chapter 8 on monogamy, to offend Christians, but I encouage everyone to take the wisdom in this book and just ignore the junk: don't throw the baby out with the bath water."
2,Dumb.,Just a pretty dumb book. I read it for a group and thought it was ridiculous. My advice? Save your money and have a fun night on the town with your girlfriends instead. Thank goodness I was already married and just read this book to follow along - I wouldn't use any of the advice here!
2,please do not waste your money,"If you want to know how popular ""Mama"" is with guys, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for any substance, then I suggest you keep looking. I can sum up the book in 3 points for you ladies who might think of buying it:1. Think about your crotch a lot2. Ask for what you want, say thank you when you get it3. Mama Gena wants you to know how successful she is at oozing sex appeal, by smiling prettily at men, while thinking about her crotch.This book is so silly, I was actually wondering if it was a 'spoof' of self-help books."
1,Want to be the alpha male of women? buy this book,"First, one star, but all men should read this book to learn what to stay away from. Glad I got the book as an emotionally healthy male (50) who’s going to start dating again. Being a cross between the good traits of alpha and the good traits of beta is the new way of thinking for men. Gina’s book is the scariest thing I’ve ever read, and if a male author said things about women like she said about men in her book, he would never get away with it! Gina and your girls, have fun, but you won’t get near a real person who won’t be manipulated. Ride ‘em cowgirls, all the way to you know where.Personally, I think this author has a different type of conscience than the majority of people out there, that’s the only thing that makes any sense about how she could think and be this way, and share it all like she's proud of it. Yikes and Yee Haw It's all about you, nice relationship methodology, NOT."
1,One Star is too Many!,I've never been so disappointed in a book. Think about your crotch and smile just about sums it up. Please don't waste your money!
1,Blah blah blah,"I think the author is so enamored with her hipness, that she has convinced a wimpy editor to not edit out all the crap, crap, crap. Horrid, boring, blathering writing. She goes on, and on, and on. She could say what she means in half the words. Waste of time to read this. (Must she continue with the ""yo mama"" and the ""goddess"" this and that-- and Grrrr can't stand her)"
2,Not entierly unexpected...,"With any reprint you expect some amount of reduction in the quality. No copy will be quite as sharp and vibrant as the original, but this one was still quite disappointing.Even on a scale as small as this it was terribly grainy, and the lines cutting though where the original must have folded were truly unacceptable. That could have been easily rectified using any photo editing program in a matter of minutes.The print was not worth the price. Had I seen it ahead of time I would probably have not spent more than $5."
3,The Star Was Better Than The Film,"Italy's Arnold Schwarzenegger gave this movie a lot more than it gave him, fighting against an evil witch in medieval Scotland. You know how they sometimes say a film is ""not to be missed""? Well, this one is to be missed."
5,Amazing Cellist,"Seeing and hearing this group perform in the intimate surrounds of their domicle church in Venice was a most cherished memory from our October/2000 visit. Surrounded by the prestigious exhibit of ""Ancient Musical Instruments"", one of them a 400 year old bass played during the concert, we all but held our breath lest we miss one note. The encore featured Mr. Amodio, a Hugh Grant look alike with a similiar wry humour. I had no idea this instrument had the range and versatility this gifted musician displayed for our audience. If you have not heard Interpreti Veneziani in concert, this CD will start you planning your trip."
5,Another fine album by a graduate of the Prince school,"One of the many obscure solo artists of the 80s whose musical roots can be traced back to the legendary Prince, Brownmark (aka Mark Brown) made one of the more enjoyable albums of that bunch with this release. Funky tunes like ""Want You Back,"" ""She Don't Care"" and ""Contagious"" are among some of the better undiscovered funky new jack sounds of 1988, and there are a couple of sweet, new-jack styled ballads in ""I Used To Be In Love"" and ""Why Can't We Be Alone."" And finally, closing out the album is ""Stakeout"" a short but interesting piece of funky, instrumental jazz."
3,Worth spending an hour to finish it in the bookstore,"This book is interesting and inspiring, putting the long-discussed gender difference into a small volume. But the price is a bit high."
3,Covers more of Florida than competing guides,"The most useful aspect of the Fodor's Guide for Miamai and the Keys when compared to other guidebooks is that this book covers the areas north of Miami, all the way up the Atlantic coast to Sebastian. My past few trips to Florida have been to Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and Vero Beach as well as Miami and the Keys. It's nice to have the basic information in one place.However, I always feel that Fodor's guidebooks tend to be a little superficial. The last five or six I've read haven't included the hotels I've stayed at (for example a Hyatt that has been open for at least ten years). I also don't care for the type of paper stock that Fodors uses. I like to take a highlighter to my guidebooks and you can't use them on this paper because it bleeds through the pages. I will continue my quest for the perfect guidebook!"
3,"Lousy Guys Flick, Lousy Production","This DVD houses some action packed fights. You also get some promo material from the other titles available from the same producers. However, to expand on the already submitted reviews on this DVD, to fill the available space of each chapter, the audience is constantly subjected to the same two, g-string, ripping their tops off..blondes.In all honesty, I was hoping to play this video during a 'guys night' in front of the tube with pizza and beer. After viewing the DVD, I won't even acknowledge I own this DVD.What were the producers thinking?"
5,Metal stud saver,This product made the use of my sail boat cover far more easier and saved the metal studs from damage .
2,A disappointment...,"I first found out about the tDR when I stumbled across an issue of Emigre #29. It contained dense complex illustrations with very interesting and unique vector illustrations. It was perhaps one of the most innovative books I had seen in some time. However, the 3D-2D book I had purchased is not even close in regard to the work I had seen in the Emigre #29. This book, in comparision is a stripped down verson of the tDR style so many people are familiar with. I doesn't contain the unique caricatures or the funky vector illustrations but rather, plain and minimalist rectalinear designs that are often boring and dull. If you like tDR stuff then I would suggest trying to find Emigre #29. Otherwise, purchase Buro Destruct I or II if you're looking for some innovative vector based artwork."
5,Timely book for Migraines,I bought this book on the recommendation of my Neurologist. I was surprised at how much information was offered in a simple to understand format. It is a good reference for someone who suffers from Migraines like I do.
2,As a complete CD.....,"this doesn't hold up. As a New jack CD, this contains one song, one moment of greatness.That song is 'Him or Me', which is the reson why I purchased the CD in the first place. Deep grinding funk,'Big Bub' kicking up a storm on vocals, for this reason alone, if you are into New Jack Swing, buy this. The rest of the CD falls into a quiet storm/mid tempo flow, with the stand out cut being, 'Your Loves Not True'."
4,Excellent 80's R&B/New Jack music,"I would have to say, as a young adult of the 80's, this ""album"" (Yes, it was an album 1st) was great for a debut album. My favs are of course ""Him or Me"" & ""Girl, I Got My Eyes on You"" as they received good R&B; airplay at the time. However, songs such as ""Lady"", ""Your Love's Not True"" & ""You Stood Me Up"" are deserving of this debut albums worthiness of recognition. Currently, all five of these songs are on my ipod with no intension to delete at all.Their following album-c/d, ""The New Formula"" is just as Excellent if not better. A shame this group went separate ways as I would have liked to have heard more. I'd have to recommend, purchase even for the average 80's R&B;/New Jack listener or if new to the sound of THAT time!"
5,Ferony does it again,"Amazing album through and through. The standout track is ""Kansas City"" but all sound very tight and outstanding. Great job on this one, Doug Ferony."
5,Good Story --You should read it.,"Straightforward, pull no punches. Life as it happens. A male's point of view of life precipitated by wife's breast cancer. Strengths, weaknesses, confusions and subsequent growth buy a plain-venilla guy. The women in his life are wonderful, awful, outrageous and supportive in a duke's mixture of events and situations he never seems to catch up with."
1,Displeasing and Filthy,"This book is poorly written. The book jumps around within chapters. Rollie needsto do some soul searching within himself, and stop blaming everyone that has been or still is in his life for his misfortunes and problems. He seems to blame the women in his life, but yet Rollie seems to enjoy using them. Rollie spends way too much time talking about his encounters. I would not recommend this book unless you need help getting to sleep or you like reading filth."
3,A Story Worth Reading,"Reading ""River City"" is like playing the slots - you keep hoping the the next pull of the handle (turn of the page) will produce a winner. There were times I wondered why I continued to read this over-long account of middle-aged Rollie's divorce, estrangement from family, difficulties with work and attempts to make it with an assortment of women. But I found myself caring about him and hoping, till the end, that things would work out. Learning about the effects of divorce and estrangement, loss of employment and esteem from a man's perspective was revealing. Witnessing Rollie's redemption was worth the read. There were many exciting literary moments during this stream-of-consciousness narrative though careless editing detracted from its overall effectiveness. Philip Johnson has the gift of story."
4,Great Read!,"Philip Johnson's absorbing and provocative novel, River City, is an intelligent and complex odyssey of one Rollie Schneider and his marathon pursuit of enduring love, family acceptance, and redemption. Rollie seems predisposed to rejection: Mother Shirley made sure of that in his childhood. The word dysfunctional may have been coined just to describe the Schneiders.Johnson is a talented writer who sustains the reader's interest from one surprising episode to the next. Realistic, powerful description and wonderful transitional smoothness connect the reader to the next adventure where Rollie faces new conflicts, many times built upon the last. The plot is compelling, even magnetic at times. (So what are families for?) Johnson is a writer sensitive to human joy and pain, and he has a realistic grasp of the human condition. (All of us live east of Eden.) Johnson's River City is entertaining, informative and gripping."
4,Between Sex and Salvation,"Johnson traces the life of Rollie Schneider from his small-town Catholic upbringing through fatherhood, marriage, divorce, and the effort to make sense of it all. Rollie hits the ground hard more than once having bathed in the illusion of happiness and success. He is likable in that he is human. Like us, he doesn't deserve the journey downhill. But Rollie grows up from trying to please the others to ultimately accepting himself. He finds a sense of salvation (outside of evangelist rhetoric) ironically at the time that his relationships falter and the money runs out. If you liked Updike's ""Rabbit"" Angstrom, you will be pleased to meet Johnson's Rollie Schneider. The book kept me curious to the last page."
2,Entertaining and sad,"River City is a too wordy marathon of a man's frustrating search for acceptance and a satisfying relationship. I found it extremely sad that the central character never seems to learn anything from the demise of each succeeding significant connection. The author might have explained the disintegrations more fully, rather than going from euphoric compatibility directly to disconnection. A reason is given in most cases, but the reasons are external and don't delve into his (Rollie's) possible involvement with the result. Perhaps it is his blindnes to his own contributions. The net impression, thus, is a feeling of sadness for a man who never seems to be able to figure it out, even when he thinks he has. One would hope the writer would continue his efforts at novel-writing, with possibly less psychoanalysis, as the potential seems to be there for an entertaining read."
5,Clear and logical exposition,"It's not the latest book on this topic, so today, there are other texts that have more recent developments to be sure. I originally read this text about 15 years ago. But what I got from this book, that I didn't get from most, are important insights and clear understanding of the material that's covered. The authors have a deep understanding, and have teaching as their goal in writing. Most other texts in this area are lacking in one or both of those characteristics, and aren't worth the paper they are printed on."
4,Awesome DVD,"This DVD showcases some of the skills of two awesome drummers, Ian and Chad.They casually chat, play individually and together, producing an insight into there playing and background.Pretty awesome."
5,Works as it should,"These floor mats work as you would expect them to. They are thin plastic, but work just fine on our carpet under the high chair. Doesn't catch everything, but certainly helps!"
3,Not worth it,"This seemed like an excellent idea but when they arrived it wasn't quite what I was expecting. I can see these being great if you are going to a friend's house or restaurant where you don't want to leave a huge mess and you expect to just throw it out after once use. But if you are intending on using this over and over again, you would be better off getting your self a painters cloth or oil cloth tablecloth. These are just to flimsy and very slippery. Plus I don't feel that it covers a big enough area to make much of a difference."
2,Not Worth the Price,"My kids are Winnie the Pooh fans so I thought I'd surprise them with these mats. What a waste of money. The mats are as thin as a plastic garbage bag and the feet of a chair cause them to tear. Also, if you wipe them off with any elbow grease (to get off dried food) the image rubs off also. I currently use a vinyl tablecloth from Wal-Mart I paid $3 for and it works a million times better. The only plus was the seller shipped as promised."
2,Too thin,"I really didnt like it. I think it is way too thin and the material quality its poor. The graphics are nice, tough. Ok if you plan to change the mat every week or so."
3,does ok,"it's ok if your kid does not chuck finger food, but mine does so this wasn't wide enough to catch all her mess."
2,A Disappointment,"There is no life to be found in this program. Nor will it satisfy your curiosity about the existence of intelligent extraterrestrials. It should have been entitled ""Finding Organic Molecules, Energy Sources, and Liquid on the Moons in Our Solar System,"" but then, of course, nobody would buy it. On the plus side, it's great for insomnia.Hey Nova, I want some insight into intergalactic aliens and spaceships, antimatter power sources and inter-dimensional travel--not a prospective formula for creating lunar amoebas. Snap to it!"
5,Uncle nino,"My family and I really enjoyed this movie,it is truly a very nice heartwarming story for all family members.They should make more movies like this one, also the actors were great in their roles."
4,Good family film,"Uncle Nino really illustrates the differences in American culture and that of an elderly man from a small Italian town; but how each culture adapts and learns from each other.The children were spoiled and had no manners to speak of; the family was so disfunctional that it was pathetic. Uncle Nino arrives and things begin to change for the better. The actors all do a credible job, especially Joe Mantegna and Pierrino Mascarino. It's not ""The Parent Trap"" but it is very watchable."
1,save your money,"As an Italian American, I find this movie incredibly inaccurate. If Mr. Micelli was truly concerned about his Uncle Nino, he has a poor way of showing it. He and his wife were not aware of his arrival? His wife picks him up at the airport, drives him to their beautiful home, and feeds him, this is the best part,Chinese food. Wow,an Italian uncle on his first visit to America, and his niece offers him Chinese food. The man has never seen Chinese food much less ate it. Does not provide a fork, and the poor guy has to negotiate chop sticks. Mr. Micell is the only Italian I know of that does not have a bottle of red wine in his house, so Mrs. Micelli dusts off an old box of Almaden red wine, ouch, I want to puke. If I was Uncle Nino, I would have taken the next flight back to Italy. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, and a disgrace to all Italians. Go to PBS and watch Lydia's Italy, for real taste of Italy."
5,Uncle Nino DVD,I saw the premier and desired the add a DVD to my collection. I found it here many years later. It is a great family movie.
2,Big POWER or Big DISAPOINTMENT,"Bought the V28 kit 2 years ago. To me its not dependable. These batteries loose their charge in chilly temps. In 58 degrees and lower you will be unable to walk up and believe it will be ready for work unless you pull it from the charger. I am a cabinetmaker and care for my tools and even the saw-zaw looses its power fast after a full charge. For the $500.00 + I paid for it, I expect more and should last more. Even the Bag it came in has the tension spring bars ( help hold the bag open) poking out of it. They are very heavy. I simply will not buy another Milwaukee product.Expect everything except performance from these tools."
1,You Let Me Down,"The 18 volt was better by far I used the 28volt for the first month and it was fine but after that the charger stopped working and the batteries together stopped holding the charge. And believe me I take care of my tools, out of the cold when it's cold and charged properly as I do. NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Neat Memorabilia of Baltimore Opera's History,"The old Baltimore Opera Co. hands call this book ""the Silver book."" It contains pages of concise history of Baltimore's first fully professional opera venture from its humble beginnings.Consider it part-history, part-yearbook of patrons past. Especially great for fans of the BCO's first director: Rosa Ponselle.Lots of pictures in black and white tell the story side by side with narratives.While not glamorous, this book is a snapshot in time of opera as it was in America circa 1950s-1960s.My copy even contained membership marketing materials, by chance, from the first BCO season I ever attended in 1995. Brought back a few memories.As I interview patrons for a story on Baltimore's opera revival (Lyric Opera Baltimore) I find that there are much more colorful tales from the early days that still need to be collected and told. Hope I can do so."
4,a decent wilson novel,"This was an excellent novel by wilson, but after reading Nightwatcher and The Silent Witness, I know he is capable of better. I knew from page 66 on who was behind the killing of Robert. Although Wilson did come in with a big shocker at the end. Other than that, it was fairly predictable."
3,have not used it since I bought it,"Since I have not used it since I purchased it, I can not review this product. Just from my observations, it appears to be well made."
4,Can Tap,"This product works just fine. You can't really go wrong here. If you want to use the small R134A cans,like from walmart, you need this tap. Cans will not hook up to your manifold gauge set without this tap."
5,Mastercraft 85510R-134a can tap valve-screw on,"Great product, works well, worth the purchase. I hace used a/c equipment over the year a great deal and think this will work well for a long time, the last one lasted 28 years,not bad."
3,Not Bad!,"It was not as cheap as I thought it would be. I have used it only twice, but it worked just fine, and there was no clue of a leak. Good buy for the money, but not for the professional A/C guy."
4,good tap,This can tap is heavily made and appears to be of high quality - not sure on long term durability but all looks good so far.
2,Poor Quality,"Poor build quality. I never used it, so I have no idea if it would work better than it was manufactured. It had the following problems:1. The starting end of the male threads were a mess. They were distorted and chipped.2. The handle was not properly mounted on the shaft.I returned it. I'll buy something else from a store where I can see it before I purchase it."
4,"Stimulating Puzzle, Standard M&D Quality Issues","Great puzzle if you are willing to keep the bottle of elmer's glue handy. I've had the wood and the paper top seperate already. That being said, it isn't painted which is something I'm thrilled about in a child's toy. I'd rather have to use glue for touchups. My near 3 year old loves this puzzle- I think it is her favorite. The dinousaurs are built up above the scenery and I think that adds an extra dimension of fun and helps her focus on what lines up."
1,"The most leftist, anti-Reagan, anti-Israel video ever!","As the main review of this video indicates, the entire series is presented from a single leftist (not liberal, but truly leftist) perspective. In addition, executive producers WALEED ALI and MALIK ALI paint a very anti-Israel -- bordering on anti-Semetic -- picture of events, and never miss an opportunity to denounce Israel while glorifying Yassir Arafat and the PLO. The more recent footage of the 1980's and 1990's is clearly anti-Reagan and anti-Bush. And all the failings of Clinton are brushed aside and blamed on the media rather on the man himself. If you want a balanced perspective, buy some other video (if there is one). This one was just too one-sided, even for a liberal-leaning individual like me."
2,Very unbalanced series,"If you are a granola crunching Nixon hater with a world view restricted to what happened in the United States, this series is a great purchase.There is little attempt to show history other than from a leftist standpoint. The 1980s are titled The Decade of Greed while the 1990s are referred to as American Hard Drive. It always struck me that there was more selfishness exhibited in the 1990s than the 1980s but this would not conform with Motyl's worldview."
1,"Product Defective, NO response from Seller to complaint",I purchased two of these DVD sets. Sent one to my Dad for his birthday and had one sent to myself. Both sets have one dvd that does not work. I emailed the seller a few days ago and have not even received an acknowledgement of my complaint.Still hopeful.
2,Missed opportunity,"At 11 hours in length, this series had the potential to be an excellent overview of the most eventful one hundred years in human history. Unfortunately, a preoccupation with race relations and anti-war and labor movements as seen from a uniformly leftist perspective renders this a highly unwatchable series for serious historians and newcomers alike. Not that these events were unimportant, but the documentary is so leftist in its perspective that it tends to trivialize the great conflicts of the century as if the final outcome of the various movements should have been clear to everyone all along. A really sorry effort of a documentary. Unless you like unchallenging documentaries that make little effort to delve into the complexities of the 20th century, avoid this turkey at all costs."
1,The 20h Century: A moving Visual Hisory,"I loved the VHS version of this documentary, so I ordered the DVD. I was truly astonished to see that it had been entirely re-written from a leftist (not liberal, but leftist) perspective that, among other things, lets Marx and Lenin off the hook for the misery they wrought on millions. Please buy the VHS original version and forget this revisionist attempt at re-writing history. Lincoln said, ""If history isn't true then it isn't history."" This could be said of this documentary."
5,Simple but highly effective resource.,"I have tried meditation for years. Sitting alone and attempting to focus on a single subject always ended with my mind flitting about onto various tangent subjects with no real progress being made. Clearing the Subconscious for 00 Agents Daily Hypnosis Session is different. The Author gently guides you through the meditation at all times, helping you focus on the main goal of the meditation. I have found that this tape has helped me gain a newfound respect for meditation and the ability to clear away past events that have held me back. If you have not tried a guided meditation session, this one may help you clear the past and open your future, I highly recommend this simple but effective resource."
5,Very effective quickly,"I used this for about a week just for relaxing, but then I got serious and released a bad experience during the hypnosis and then forgave a pushy friend. The next time the friend came to visit, I was surprised that I was more comfortable and the frustration didn't come. So after that I released some more bad things. Seems to help a lot."
5,Best of it's type,"I tried a lot of this type stuff. Subliminals didn't work for me. At least this one makes sense and actually when I think of a past experience that I want to forget, it's not so bad. In fact, according to this tape all experiences remain in your mind, so better to release the bad feeling attached to it. So I tried to do that and I do feel more free about it. Maybe the tape or maybe just me facing it, either way, I'll take it. Good tape. I use it to sleep sometimes, too."
5,Standing On The Promises,"'We are always seeking God's message for us. We often deal with anger, depression, money problems, relationship problems and more. ""The Message Promise Book"", by Eugene H. Peterson, contains passages from the Bible on 80 different topics, covering many areas in which we all struggle to know what to think, what to say and what to do. These passages are written in the kind of contemporary language we use every day.I find this Bible promise book very helpful when I am looking for Scripture on specific topics. The book is well-organized and easy to understand. I am really happy to have ""The Message Promise Book"" on my Kindle. The Scripture in this book is comforting to read and memorize during difficult times. It is a wonderful resource to use during daily Bible study. The modern language that is used in this version is popular with young and old alike. I am standing on the promises of God!JanetteFuller.Com"
4,The theory of equilibrium of elastic systems and its applications,"While I intended to order this book, what I had in my mind was in order to fully understand Castigliano's Theorem I got to have it. So I purchased this product."
1,Horrible choice of tunes,"I tried several times to listen to this and get some benefit but it was a waste of money. The music is nerve racking, not peaceful. It would wake me up not help me rest. I can't believe anyone could find this helpful. Go with Bedtime Beats or Sleep Soundly instead. I wish I could get my money back for this stinker!"
5,An Interesting and Insightful Book,I enjoyed this book very much and am proud to add it to my esoteric library. Definetly a worth while read for those interested in Chi Kung and the esoteric arts.
1,Partial Order Fulfillment is unacceptable!!!!!,"I ordered two of these shirts - one large, and one XXL. The vendor (Old Glory)cancelled one shirt because it was unavailable, and shipped the other. I should have been offered a chance to cancel the entire order when it was determined that I could not receive the entire order. The single shirt was useless to me. They cancelled the XXL, but you probably cannot tell that from this listing. This was the worst purchase experience I have ever had with Amazon."
3,OK,"I bought this bass three years ago.It came with everything I needed to set it up, and the sound was excellent.But a couple of months after, the guitar's cable input jack somehow stop functioning the way it should, now the cable output wont go in completely and, of course, the sound is affected.Still, I think it is a very good package for beginners and at a good price."
2,"Great music, sloppy packaging...","This is supposed to be a 3 CD set. I got 3 CDs, but two of them are the same! An e-mail to the company produced no response whatsoever.If Light Records is a Christian company, they need to improve their quality control and ethical standards. This isn't a very good witness!The 2 CDs I actually got are wonderful. Just wish I'd had a chance to hear the third one I paid for."
2,missing disk,"I bought this box set as a gift so it wasn't opened until well past the 30 day return window and I was told by the recipient that the 2nd disc was missing. I guess $12 for two cds isn't bad but I was supposed to get three. Open your package right away if you order this ""box set"".The music is ok. Not my thing but someone asked for it specifically so I got it."
1,Suddenly Dissatisfied!,"There were [only] 3 centerpieces that I found to be ""ok"". Overall, this book was stodgy and unimaginative. The photos lacked charm. No disrespect to senior citizens, but the centerpieces reminded me of something an elderly woman would make. If you appreciate conventional methods of creativity, then this book is for you. But if you are looking for unique inspiration or some Preston Bailey~type action, don't waste your time buying this book. Check it out at the library. The End."
1,Disappointed,"The summary and review were not helpful at all and misleading. As a food service professional, I am always looking for new ideas for tablescapes for my banquet facility. The book was impractical and the centerpieces were uninspiring."
5,Great ideas enclosed,This was exactly what I needed. This book has some great ideas in it. Very beautiful.
5,Gorgeous music; gorgeous voice; gorgeous girl; (why the h*** did she have to share a stage with FERGIE?!),"An immensely talented singer who can make her voice go very high and twist it in every direction imaginable, and who should NEVER have to share the same stage with anybody except maybe Aretha, Chaka, etc.It's not her best known song, but my favorite song by her was ""Come To Me"" which puts her voice against an original and still very fresh sounding synth background, which I sincerely hope was never reused by anybody, because she did so well with it that I would probably end up being sick if I ever heard anybody rapping over it."
1,I received CD in a sticky film and unusable,I looked for this cd for years and was excited to find it. I was hugely dissappointmented once the cd was open because it looked like it was submerged in a sticky film (not water) which caused the cd not to play. After wiping it over and over with cd cleaning supplies nothing happened. It came from China and I'm not paying international rates to return it so I wont deal with this company anymore.
1,Missing sample database,"The book works around a sample database which supposedly could be downloaded from a link in the book.The link proved to be outdated and no sample database could be found.This is a serious flaw, as the beginner has no visual reference point."
3,"Probably complete, but...","This book is full of interesting data - and is even probably complete. However when it comes to searching the information you need, this is a different story.The biggest problem is the index. You need a refresh about the syntax of the command to dump/recover the database... don't look for ""dump"" or ""recover"" it's not in.Even the simplest operations like ""How do I extend the fields of my table?"", there is neither ""add"" or ""field"" in the index (besides the FIELD() function).Finally the information is hard to find within the chapters also. There are 13 head of chapters with non intuitive titles. The author had seemingly a hard time to manage all that information, and distributing it logically among chapters. Repetitions, omissions,... the book is not pleasant to search/follow/read.I agree one must be glad to have a book about Mysql, this is why I gave 3 stars, but the book could be largely improved."
4,lots of fun,"Both my cats loved these catnip balls--only reasons I rated 4 stars instead of 5 were: 1) I wished they came in different colors, so I could keep straight which ball belongs to which cat, and 2)they are a little pricey and there doesn't seem to be a discount for buying in bulk. But for a treat that also gives the cats a lot of exercise, they're great."
3,Nice but requires work,"I had the same problem with my pump and followed the instructions someone posted to open the nozzle at the end of the tube. Works great now. I'm a young woman with little handyman ability so if I can do it I'm pretty sure anyone can. I used a paint scraper to pry off the metal rings and cap on it.FYI....I actually am using mine in my bathroom as a mouthwash dispenser rather than booze. I got sick of my guests putting their mouth on my Listerine bottle, like I wouldn't notice. Gross!"
5,Great addition to the Home Bar,Bought 4 of these with the special offer worked out at $12.50 each. Well worth it. surprised at how robust they are built out of metal. Highly recommend this for the price.
2,Not Happy,"Love the pump, if it wasn't cracked around bottom making the whole thing lean. My son already threw the box away before I saw it so now I am stuck with it. If it didn't lean it would be great!"
5,Perfect Gift For Liquor Drinkin' Dads,It's a little smaller than I thought but it is able to hold all of the liquor out of an average sized liquor bottle. It was a beautiful dispenser that came in a well packaged box. It's sleek design makes it a nice item to be in our little mini bar. It was a Christmas gift for my dad and he loved it because he also loves to drink.
3,Good but not great,"Fodor's gives the basics needed to travel with kids in Paris, but the information about days in operation and opening hours is not always accurate.Alan Safani"
5,An alphabet of riddles,"This book features 26 short riddles where the key words are never named explicitly. Instead, they are described with rhyming pictures and shown in the pictures. Some of the clues are obvious, and others will cause even adults to pause and think a bit. The blurb on the cover says ""Each letter has a poem. Every poem has a clue. The answers are in the back."" There are no scary parts in the book. The book has about 600 words."
5,most excellent,"if noone else delivers, go to Anthony. The saint of the coommon person, from whom everyone can love. from lost keys to jobs to souls, anthony provides."
1,We Charge Genocide,"This book was listed as fairly new. But when it arrived, it was in a poor condition. As soon as I opened it (pages 94-95), the book nearly split into two halves. Pages 87-94 have already come off from the book and many more pages are likely to come off when I start reading the entire book. I am not very happy with this particular purchase and wish I could get a replacement and send this one back to the seller. The seller should have indicated that it is a fragile book that could come apart when one begins to read it."
1,A disappointment.,"I love Cuban music. I have hundreds of recordings, thousands of songs. I am writing this not for the casual listener who thinks of this as ""world music"", but for the dedicated one who can appreciate a bolero and who might be temped by this album.Most of the interpretations on this CD stilted and loungy.Rifa strays into the ugliness that is ""salsa."" Uxia's renditions are particularly atrocious, but she's not alone. At best, the majority of tracks are forgettable mediocrities.Most of the artists on this CD are not fit to interpret this music.Funerales para Papa Montero is very good, but then Cariada Hierrezuelo is a legend in her own right. If only she would have done the entire album...Even the song translations are poor and change the meaning of the original.Do yourself a favor and listen to Maria Teresa, as this ""tribute"" does no homage to her genius. If you want a superb sampling of real trova by actual trova artist, not imitations, try Casa de la Trova (ASIN B00000J26Y).KP"
2,Buying MX-3000 was a big expensive mistake,"We splurged on a $20K home theatre bonanza, all of which is pretty awesome except the mx-3000 universal remote. There is a constantly fluctuating variation in the sensitivity and latency of the touch pad. I feel like the biggest sucker in the world sitting here on the sofa having to make 10 attempts at pressing channel ""500."" After 3 seconds it takes whatever you've been able to successfully press .. so, a few times is is only ""5"", then ""50"", then ""500"", then ""800"" (oops, you dropped your finger too close to the 8!). I promise you, it is the most frustrating, annoying thing you will ever pay $1000 for. We are very close to throwing it away and fishing out all the remotes our installers left somewhere in the theatre cabinet."
2,2006 PDR Nurse's Drug Handbook (Pdr Nurse's Drug Handbook,"I don't like it - I work in critical care and it fails to list the intravenous drug compatibilities that Nursing 2004 Drug Reference has. IN critical care IV drug compatibilities are so important! So, I'm still relying on my Nursing 2004 book at work. Will not buy this book again - wasted my money - Janet"
5,"Great, great, great. Very insightful, useful and compelling","A little simplistic at times (which is both good and bad), but absolutely right on target. I learned a ton that I have put to good use right away. It's even better on the second playing. A definite winner."
5,An informative guide to the intricacies that are the everyday work life of the experienced farmer,"A work of careful, articulate scholarship, The Furrow And Us: Essays On Soil And Sentiment, authored by Walter Thomas Jack and edited by Zachary Michael Jack (Assistant Professor of English at North Central College and fourth generation Iowa farmer's son), is an informed and informative guide to the intricacies that are the everyday work life of the experienced farmer. The Furrow And Us features essays pertaining to organic farming, the ""Plowman's Folly"" and the till versus no-till debate which changed the face of agriculture in American history. The Furrow And Us is a highly recommended read for the ecologist, soil conservationists, practicing farmers, and students of the agriculture and agronomy."
5,Fun and Educational!,"My son first used this puzzle with his speech therapist when he was just 2years old. Three days later he bit into a cracker and told me, ""look, it's a pentagon"", and it was. He had learned most of the shapes from playing with this puzzle only once. It is very educational, because it doesn't use fun or slang for the names of the shapes, this puzzle teaches the real names of the many advanced shapes. Most toys just have a few shapes and always the same few. Also, the different textures are great for children with sensory issues. We highly recommend this one!"
4,Awesome. Probably for 18 mos+,"I bought this for my 1-year old. It is really neat. He will need to get more comfortable matching colors and shapes before he's an expert, but we play with it together and he seems to enjoy it."
3,Good Product- Tiny Bottles,The product was good but when they say travel size it is really like a little sample size. The whole box was the size of large deck of cards. For the price- thought they would be more the size of like a travel shampoo.
4,Make it Your Weekend!,"It's a great product for a great weekend, guaranteed to get the blood pumping."
1,Hope your not well endowed or in a hurry!!!,"I was shocked at how small this kit was - not for a long weekend! I also didn't get it delivered until much later than promised and it was a Valentines Gift, it arrived 3 days later, I ordered well in advance.(10 days!) Another online dissappointment."
1,"Great, maybe for a elf","I had no idea how small this product was... i knew it was a sampler set, but that doesnt even begin to tell it's size. The whole ox is only a couple inches by a couple inches. Each bottle only holds about a teaspoon of liquid.... for 30.00???? whatever"
1,Super Small - too much money - over charged on shipping,Buy directly from Kama Sutra and save money. They have it for $18.95 and hardly any shipping cost. I made the mistake of buying two for $49.90 and then was charged $10.50 for shipping and the boxes are as small as my hand. Total rip-off...next time i will do my homework better!
3,weekender kit,"Cute idea, but WAY overpriced. A trip to bath and body works would get you a lot more for the money for a special weekend..."
1,rip off,"This is not worth the money. The containers are so tiny, you can't even use it, and they are not as advertised. Don't bother"
3,So small,"Everything in the box is so small! The box itself is the size of a deck of cards, so you can imagine how big the bottles are inside! Still waiting for that special weekend to try it out..."
5,Multi-Cultural Celebrations: The Paintings of Betty Laduke,Betty Laduke's work is artfully reproduced in this wonderful collection of ethnic inspired paintings. Her story is also amazing as she travelled around the world to live with and experience the culture itself. The book i purchased was used but in excellent condition. Thank you !
4,"Let's Go, uses music to motivate kids to learn English","Let's Go by R. Nakata and K. Frazier uses amusic theme to match the vocabulary and grammarthat is being taught. The words are especiallywritten for the lesson being taught. The use ofpuppets is encouraged with the text, and hasproved to be an effective attention getter, andmotivator for young children learning Englishas a foreign language. My sister Debbie Nouriteaches English in Iran using this book - ANDit WORKS !"
1,wrong item,"The Click Clack canisters are described as being 8 inches tall. However, the canisters I was sent in the mail were 13"" tall."
1,Among the Betrayed: A Review,"If this book were part of a series, I would understand the way it seems to badly need a prequel and/or sequel better, but it stands alone. In my opinion, it shouldn't. It's repetitive and seems to be desperate for another book to explain it's weak plot!"
3,Among the Betrayed,"While this book was a step down from the other two, it was still an enjoyable read. The reader is introduced to four new characters in the Shadow Children series--Nina Idi, the main character from whose perspective you read; and three orphan kids who Nina is meant to betray--Percy, Matthias, and Alia, all younger than Nina herself. You may remember Nina from Among the Imposters; one of the girls who came to meet the boys in the woods. You get the chance to step outside of Luke's shoes and into somebody else entirely. While it can be irritating to suddenly be thrown into a new situation with a nearly halfway through a series, it's also a bit refreshing, in a strange way.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
5,Among the betrayed review,This book was the third book to the series and probably the best so far. This is the best series I've ever read! I definitely recommend this book/series to people.
3,Bec's Review,"I thought this book was pretty good, but lacked in drama and suspense compared to other novels by the author. She was very good with sensory details and explaining what's happening. But it just wasn't as interesting because there weren't as many things going on. Plus, it was pretty short in length. It only really focused on Nina. I would recommend this book to someone 13 and younger."
5,Among the Berayed,"Have you ever had a nightmare? Its nothing compared to Nina Idi. Or as her real name calls her Elodie Luria. In a nightmare you usually get to to wake up. However for Nina......she is living one.Nina Idi. Your normal average six-teen year old. However , you can't call Nina normal. For in her community the third-child in the family is illegal. Unfortunaly for Nina Idi, she is an illegal child. Jason, he is the love of Nina's life.So she thinks. Jason betrays her, and turns her into the Population Police. Now her life is going to change. Forever.What I like about Among the Betrayed is that how the author gave Nina great qualities. Nina is a girl who thinks before she acts. Like cause and effect. You can call Nina honest.(If you delete the part about her fake i.d.)Would I give this book a reccomendaion? Of course. It is perfct for any reader who loves action, a little bit of romance,and drama."
3,Among the Betrayed,"this book talks about a girl that lives in a country that people can only have two childreen. She has to hide because she is the third child. SHe gets a fake ID and goes to a boarding school. She meets a boy that she really likes but gets betrayed by him. He tells the authority that they knew where a bunch of third child were and that him and her would help them get it. Nina doesn't have anything to do with the plan, so they tell her that they are not going to kill her but they tell her that she has to betray this kids. SHould she betray them?read the book and find out"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK ! 1000000000000000000000000000 STARS,"This is the best book i have ever read. It is about this girl named nini idi. real name:Elodie . She is a 3rd child and 3rd children are not allowed. she gets cought and gets let out but the only thing is she has to work with the population police. Gets put in a jail cell with 3 kids.Mission:see where they got their fake i.d.s. steals food. 24 hours or all 3 of them die Nini is thinking they can run away. Will they be caught? You have to read this book to find out. YOU SHOULD REALLY BUY THIS BOOK!!!! AND I PROMISE, YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Good like the preceding books,I was a little surprised because fitness about a whole different character than the preceding books but it was still good and at sometimes mysterious!!
4,Among the Betrayed,I really liked the book because it had alot of adventure in it. I liked how the little kids were very clever and they were good and problem solving. I also liked how Elodie was going to tell the Hating man about them but hse decided that she was going to save them instead.-C.B
5,The maps make this fine book an excellent one,"If McClellan was often bewildered by Lee's location, the reader of this book without the maps would be hard pressed to grasp the essence of the battle. As a casual reader of Civil War histories, the text alone simply could not convey the full picture of heroic moments by each side. The delineation of woods, orchards, corn fields, and bridges, accompanied by brigade icons, were a great help to my imagine and I found myself thumbing back to a map to follow the various stages of the battle. An appendix makes clear the source of the maps and vouch for their authenticity. Great job!!!"
5,Highly recommended,"Sears offers a thorough account of the battle of Antietam using a wide variety of sources to weave the story together. He makes especially good use of the personal accounts of the participants of both sides. His analysis of both the events leading up to and the ramifications of the battle are fair, and help contribute to the understanding of the greater strategies involved in Lee's first invasion of the North.It is no secret that Sears is no fan of George McClellan, and he does a good job of presenting the facts. Some may say that the author spent too much time criticizing McClellan and his decisions, but I believe understanding the vagaries of the General's mind is key to understanding why the fight unfolded the way it did.As with his other titles, Sears does a marvelous job of turning an expert piece of historiography into a compelling narrative. I highly recommend all of his work."
5,Rainbows are everywhere!,"These solar powered crystals are awesome. I love the way the rainbows flow across the walls of my office, kitchen and bedroom. Don't order just one, the multiple cascading rainbows will brighten your day."
2,mechanically inadequate,"I loved the rainbow maker so much that I bought two more for friends. It has just recently stopped working well. The gears will not initiate unless I tap on it to get them moving. I will try to return it this week, and contact my friends asking if they need replacements as well."
1,Didn't work!,"My friend has this and it's great, but the one we bought for my niece has never moved/worked. I'm very disappointed, but they didn't keep the box (since they'd never seen one before and didn't realize what it was suppose to do), so I guess I can't return it :("
1,"Too little power, too flimsy","I live in Brazil and even with plenty of sunlight, it doesn't spin. Also the crystals have come off (because of flumsy attachment). It is still fun though (as you do get rainbows, except they don't move) Good idea, bad execution. And a little too expensive for what it is worth."
1,What a let down,"I ordered this product well in advance of Valentine's Day intending to give it as a gift. I finally received it last week and it doesn't work. I have it placed in a window on the 12th floor of a glass building in full blast Springtime sunshine and NOTHING is happening. The crystal is kind of cheesy too. However, I am pleasantly pleased with Marshall Field's return policy -- hence the 1 star vs. a 0 star."
5,Rainbow Maker Makes Magic,"This is my go-to gift for any occasion. It makes a great baby gift. It's a terrific stocking stuffer. Rainbows dance throughout your house, when the sunlight warms the solar chip. They sneak around corners, bounce off mirrors. It magic!"
2,Only buy this in the summer,"Buy it in the summer when you will get a lot of sunshine and rainbows, because it won't last an entire season.I could not decide if I should give this 2 or 3 stars. The concept is fantastic, and when it worked, the product was fantastic. But like so many other reviewers have stated, it only works for a couple months."
2,Doesn't work,"I bought one of these rainbow solar things from another source and it is still working after a year. This one doesn't turn at all. Disappointed that the return policy is ""partial refund"" and no S&H refund - not worth the effort."
2,Where is a rainbow?,I bought this for my 8 years old brother. He want it very much. But the rainbow is not much more than a small faint streak of light in his room. Certainly not worth the money.
1,Never worked.,"I ordered this for my kids for Easter. It's 7 months later and we've never had a rainbow. I was told I could return it but after shipping and packaging, it really wouldn't be worth it. Bummer."
1,Rip Off!!,I ordered this item thinking Swarovski product has got to be fabulous..Not at all :-(..The product is put together very poorly.. Does not work as it says and the wiring is Cheap metal...Tried to call the Company and Got put on hold forever with no solution..Tried to email Kikkerland to be told Google has returned my email as undeliverable..Please save some money and aggravation and DO NOT ORDER the rainbow makers!!Companies like them should go out of business and be heal responsible for their lack of ethics!
4,rainbow maker,The two rainbow maker's that I ordered are working wonderfully. The transaction was quick and packageing was very adequate. I will probably order more later. This is a wonderful product that brings much joy.
3,"Some of them work, some of them don't",I have purchased 6 of these as gifts. Half of them have stripped gears. Some never worked and some worked for a while. The gears are cheap plastic and wear out. I get a lot of sun so they get a lot of use. Just beware. I like the concept and they are great when they work. They should upgrade the parts and add a little to the price. It would be worth it.
2,Rainbow Maker,"We all loved it for a couple of months and then it mysteriouosly stopped turning... nothing SEEMS damaged, it did not drop or get mistreated, just stopped operating and that was a big let-down.... otherwise it's a fascinating and beautiful ""gadget""...I see others have had similar problems & we hope the manufacturer will redesign it a bit and sell a better model... 5 Stars for fun and innovation; 2 Stars only for quality of manufacture & design..."
3,YES AND NO,"THIS IS A FASCINATING PRODUCT BUT...AND ITS A BIG BUT...THE RUBBER BACK THAT ATTACHES TO THE WINDOW IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND I'VE HAD TWO OF THESE. ENDED UP SENDING ONE BACK BECAUSE OF IT FALLING AND THEN NOT WORKING. AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH THE SECOND ONE. AND IT WAS DEFINITELY ATTACHED TO THE WINDOW BUT AFTER AWHILE, IT FELL AND THEN DIDN'T WORK PROPERLY. WHEN IT WORKED, IT WAS GREAT. BUT FOR THIS KIND OF MONEY, IT SHOULD HAVE A BACKING THAT ISN'T SO CHEAP AND LIGHTWEIGHT."
1,Very Disappointing,Bought this item for my husband for Christmas. It only worked one time. Since then it has not worked at all. For $20 plus it is a huge disappointment. I would expect something that would at least work once in awhile.
5,"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT!!!!!","I can't say enough about how much I love these products. I have bought three of the singles and one of the doubles. I intend to buy several more for Christmas. They make adults and children, especially toddlers and infants, feel so happy and entertained. Everday at three o'clock the show starts and goes for several hours.My 5 month old and two year old grandchildren are just enthralled by them. I highly recommend them.I put mine in a west window, They do have to have direct sunlight and a slight cloud stops them in their tracks but I live in a very sunny local. Love them !!!I also am a nurse in a skilled nursing facility and bought one to put in the window for our residents. Works wonders on little ole old folks to brighten their day."
3,Cool but fragile,"It makes beautiful light spots with a little rainbow inside, turning slowly around the room.But it is very fragile. The very first day I installed in one of my windows, it fell three times (from about 30cm to the floor), and the edges of the crystal were broken. Also, due to the last hit, the gears get stuck."
5,Delightful reminder of Gods covenant Gen 9:13,The Kikkerland Solar-powered rainbow maker produces Spectacular rainbow colors around my kitchen on a sunny day. I have had mine for over two years and like it so much I now buy them for my friends to encourage them.
1,"Doesn't Work, Don't Buy","This product has never worked as promised. I bought it for my grandson, and he has beeb sorely disappointed. I thought the first one was damaged, so bought a second one, throwing good money after bad. The second performed as poorly as the first. The supposed ""turning"" of the crystal producing the rainbow effect has never occurred in either of the two. There has never been a rainbow. I would actually rate this Zero stars. Save your money, don't buy this product."
1,Never has worked...,"I bought this item as a Christmas present for my daughter who is away at college. I do my shopping early (and online) to avoid the rush. When my daughter came home at Spring Break, she brought the Rainbow Maker with her. It seems it had NEVER worked. By the time I had it back, it was too late to return it! This is a MAJOR disappointment..."
1,Doesn't even work..... disappointed,A lousy piece of non-working junk from Kikkerland. Wouldn't have been such a slap in the maw if it didn't cost 16 bucks.I would strongly recommend you steer clear of these.
1,"Well, we did try...","The first one we received did not work at all. So I returned it for a second, which also did not work. As best as I could tell, there was no damage to either; they just did not turn no matter how much light they got. I'd give it '0' stars if I could as I lost money on the transaction."
4,Nice rainbows,"I initially bought this to entertain my two furry friends (cats), but they got bored with it after a few days. However, my mom loved the rainbows...very calming she said, so I gave it to her. It does work as advertised, but you need direct sunlight to power the maker. If it is cloudy, even thought it is bright, it won't work."
4,Just about as expected,"Cute idea - my toddler and preschooler both love it...when it works. It needs direct sunlight to make the crystal spin, so make sure you place it somewhere you get a lot of sun all day. It would be great for someone with a second story window that gets sun all afternoon. The rainbows spin around and my kids can't take their eyes off of them. I personally am a fan too. It's a nice gadget, just make sure you have a good place to put it. Would definitely buy again."
5,A gift of rainbows,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother who is elderly and has poor vision. She was thrilled as the rainbows danced about her room. It was the perfect gift. The prismatic rainbows are vivid. She said, who would have ever thought to give me rainbows! As a gift it spoke of all those warm feelings that usually impossible to express in a box with wrapping paper and a bow."
5,My New Toy,"MY NEW TOYIt catches the sun on a small flat plateAnd drains a dribble of fusion powerNow converted to a flow of ionsThrough a nest of copper twigs loop-a-loopedAround a tiny pivoted armatureWithin a lode-stone's immutable force field.Cascading from the electron-powered .muscle,A stone-fall of gears cheek-by-jowlIn layers arranged inner and outer,Birthing a slowly spinning rodThat terminates in a gymnast's trapeze.Aswing there in somnolent ease isSwarovski's elegant Bohemian gem.Each turn captures rays from its distant turbineAnd splits them into silent, moving rainbows.The wonder of it all leaves me breathless;The sun's station one hundred million miles awayAnd yet it turns a wheel tirelessly on my paneFloating birds with gorgeous raiment on my walls."
3,"Clever idea, not always good quality","I have about 20 of these solar powered gadgets. Most of them work well. Some better than others. About 4 of them worked for about a month, then inexplicably stopped. I opened one up and found a loose wire. Another I opened and could find nothing wrong. There is a tiny circuit board inside which I think is the culprit. Like I say, I have 20, and will probably get more, but I have little choice, as it's the only thing like it on the market."
1,Was nice when it worked....,I don't normally rate very low but this device only lasted a few months before it stopped working for no apparent reason. It was placed on a clean window that gets plenty of sunlight throughout the day and it worked fine until today. The gears don't move at all when under direct sunlight and I tested this by bringing it outside on a sunny day to make sure. The device was great when it worked but I expected it to last at least a year or so....I am very disappointed.
5,Kikkerland Solar-Powered Rainbow Maker,"I love my Kikkerland Solar-Powered Rainbow Maker! When the sun shines on my rainbow maker the crystal begins to turn and showers rainbows all around the room! My nickname is ""Rainbow Grammy"". My grandson Gavin started calling me this when I showed him how to make rainbows by letting the sun shine through a crystal. Having the crystal turn insures that the rainbows dance around the room as long as the sun is shinging on the rainbow maker. Maybe you know someone who can't get out and has to just sit around day after day, this would be a wonderful gift to brighten their day!!!"
2,Love the rainbows but . . .,". . . after a short time of enjoying the moving prisms, the gears jammed, so, we just hung the crystal in the window. I still enjoy the rainbows but it was a disappointment."
1,"Great when they work, but that's a gamble!","Our family got these as gifts at Christmas. My brother's worked immediately. Neither my mother's nor mine worked, and upon close inspection I found that they had drilled a wire in half right at the hinge to the solar panel. Not being able to return it and fascinated by the mechanism, I soldered new wire and now I love the thing enough to consider buying another one (but only if I can find it at a store to test it first!) I haven't had any issues with the gears stripping as other people have said.That's 2 out of 3 that didn't work. How hard would it be for them to hold these up to sunlight and ""inspect"" them? They should start spinning immediately in bright sunlight- no waiting- so if you get one that doesn't, I'd recommend exchanging it for one that works. Kids of all ages will enjoy it."
3,downside of solar powered rainbow maker,"Solar powered rainbow maker: One big problem given the ever changing angle and position of the sun is that the solar panel is fixed, and would be better on a swivel base, because it only works when the panel DIRECTLY faces the sun."
2,Very cool idea...hope I can get another,"I ordered this as a present for my 5 year old daughter. She loves the rainbows but is as disappointed as I am that the gears don't turn.Reading various sites I learned that these devices are very sensitive -- they don't work in double pained windows, nor with screens. I took mine right outside at noon (no glass between me and the sun!) -- still no movement after an hour of direct ""charging"".I have written to the seller, am hoping they will understand. So many people seem to enjoy it right out of the box, that my guess is I just need a replacement (which I hope they will honor since it is more than 30 days since I bought it). I will provide an update.--------------------------------------------------Update:The company was great! They sent me a new one which works as described. I am planning on buying more because they give quite a colorful light show in the kitchen over breakfast, starting our days with a little delight."
4,Solar-Powered Rainbow Maker Very Cool,"Great idea. Definately needs direct sunlight. Window suction cups do not work at all (window suction cups have never worked on any other application I've tried either - so, it is not the Solar-Powered Rainbow Maker's fault). Must use alternate methods to hang in a window. Not very effective or attractive ways to hang from the molded thingies (or whatever those tabs are). But I love the idea of Solar-Powered and the Rainbows are fantastic."
5,Great Gift!,This is a fantastic gift for anyone who's a fan of rainbows. Especially if they are fairly stationary such as an elderly friend or relative. Great for cheering up someone who's down with an illness too! I've gotten a couple of these for friends and family members and it's always a big hit. They've always worked well and are great for adults or kids!
4,Lovely,"The rainbow maker is such a delightful presence in a sunny room. We enjoy the colors circling the family room and sometimes reaching out to the next room. We have ordered many of these before since they are great gifts. This is the first time from Amazon, I believe. One problem. one of the two rainbow makers does not work. The last gear does not quite mesh with the one above it so I wonder what the procedure is to return one that is not properly working. I threw away the paperwork before I checked to see if each rainbowmaker was working, as they always have before."
5,It's so pretty!,"The pack came quite deteriorated, but the rainbow maker was still OK.I took it out of the box to check if it works. I held it near a sunny window and it immediately started to turn and make many many little beautiful rainbows. I don't know if it's supposed to make bigger rainbows, but it's very pretty like this.I bought it to give it as a gift to someone beloved, so I didn't hang it to the window (I just wanted to make sure it works, and I can't use the package anymore anyway)."
5,beautiful,"I had been lusting over this rainbow maker for years after I saw in a store for $35. When I discovered it on Amazon for $20, I asked for it for Christmas. I live in Pittsburgh, where there are very few clear days, especially in winter. It took a few weeks, but the sun finally shone bright enough, and I was not disappointed. I've read many complaints about the amount of sunlight necessary to make the crystal turn, but there wouldn't be rainbows without direct sunlight, anyway. The rainbow maker turns my living room (or any room with a south-facing window)into a disco, with streaks of white and color racing in all directions around the room. I was nervous my cat would be too excited by the rainbows (she goes nuts over laser pointers) or know the rainbow maker from the window, but she seems to be only mildly curious. I find it mesmerizing, and a beautiful way to celebrate the very rare sunny days."
2,Gears slipping,"As noted by many other reviewers there is no quality control for this product. It did not work straight out of the box. When I tried to return it I found out that Amazon would not replace the item, but would refund my money after I returned it. I bought this for a present and now it will be too late to get another. You would think that someone would be checking this product before selling it, seeing that there is a known problem with the mechanism.I should have listened better to the negative reviews posted."
3,"Really cool product that makes for a nice gift, but only lasted about 5 months.","I bought two of these for my sister and girlfriend. They are very cool and are a great accessory to a room. Finding a place where the sunlight will hit it is the hard part but once you do that the job is done. Unfortunately the one I bought for my sister stopped spinning after about 5 months or else I would give it 5 stars. Can't say how my girlfriends worked out because were no longer together. Great idea anyways, and a wonderful gift."
1,rainbow maker..,i receive this item.the dame thing doesn;t even work..and i tried to ask for my money back..it's already been 3 weeks..and i still have not receive my money back. I even try to contact the maker of this item..they were nice enough to send me a brand new one for replacement. What do you know..it still doesn;t work..(yes..i put under the sun!!!) but..heck no..still do not work.david
1,worthless!!,"THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK DOESN'T WORK AT NIGHT, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!!? Who would pay [this much] for a piece of glass that you could probably find on the ground?"
5,Love it,"This is the 2nd rainbow maker I've purchased for myself. The first one lasted about 8 years, which amazes me with all those gears! I've given quite a few as gifts also, and they are always happily received. Wonderfulway to brighten up a room."
1,Falls apart,"It worked at the beginning, but quit spinning almost immediately thereafter. We left it up because it still made static rainbows, but hanging in the sun, the plactic deteriorated and finally broke in pieces. The kids were very disappointed. I would not buy another one."
3,a great idea,"I was thrilled with this purchase, but couldn't get the darn thing to work, with any light source. I live in Washington state, and we're known for cloudy weather. It took several weeks until there was a day sunny enough to make it work. I had begun to wonder if I'd received a broken one. It takes STRONG, direct sunlight to get it to function. But it works well in that condition. I'm just a little concerned about how much light source it takes to make it work."
2,lasts about a month,"We have received 2 of these as presents after buying 2 ourselves. All have broken within about two months,stopping turning. It is pretty while it lasts, but ultimately cheap plastic junk that will end up in the trash."
5,Beautiful,I would highly recommend this to anyone. I bought it for my mother and she loves it. My sister wanted one too. It really does make nice rainbows in your living room.
5,Great bar,"I purchases this directly from Cap, but thought I would put a review here too. This hex bar has grips a few inches higher than the bar itself. This helps taller lifter. I am 6'2 and doing traditional deadlifts with a straight bar was getting down right scary as the weight increased. This bar is the greatest thing."
1,Stinky hat,"I received the box and I was so excited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UNTIL I OPENED THE BOX.........my hat smelled so bad, it was like a can of spray paint was let off in the box, My hat was bent and crushed and all out of shaped , IT EVEN HAD STRAW OR PAPER DAMAGE....THIS DOES NOT COME IN A HAT BOX ........ THEY WAY THEY SHIPPED IT THE BOX WAS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR THE HAT.............SO IM SAD TO SAY THIS IS GOING BACK..... IF YOU HAVE ANY BREATHING PROBLEMS THIS IS NOT THE HAT FOR YOU. bESIDES WHO WANTS A SMELLY HAT..... AND THE EMBLEM THAT HAS THE CATS ON IY IS SO SMALL YOU CANNOT SEE IT, SHAME ON YOU KIMORA SIMMONS"
3,"Good CD, Great CD",Good CD if you like The Wedding's style of making fun music. Great CD if you're already a fan of them. I seen them live about a year ago and they were great. Me and my friends all had such a good time seeing them.
1,Harddisk Crashed - All my data are unrecoverable!,Used this for just a few weeks. It was working fine till today. It just died on me. The harddisk is a Hitachi 400gb (made in China).
4,Works great! Lasts forever!,"Received 2 of these as stocking stuffers for Christmas 2 years ago and the batteries are still going strong! They really just last forever. The only thing that kept me from the fifth star was that the metal interlocking band is sometimes difficult to take on and off. That being said, considering you only have to deal with that every few years, its a small detail and still definitely a flashlight i keep with me all the time."
5,Great light for the nightstand,These lights are excellent for around the home or travel. I leave one in my travel bag for those hotel rooms that have no light. The dim 24 hour light is just enough to find the light when in a dark room. It can be turned on to higher levels if needed. It is also great to hang from a tent if you are camping in a non moonlight environment. Makes it a lot easier to find a robe and shoes.
3,Not what i expected,"I wish I could have handled one of these lights before making the purchase. The lens was not clear, with flaws in it. A piece of the orange rubber case can be seen behind the lens when looking directly into the lens. A scratch is on the outside of the lens. The design of the case could be better. Battery consumption much greater than expected but i do use high because low is useless to me. It is waterproof and does not break easily. Pretty cool light for a kid but not for me. I have high expectations and this light did not meet them. You may like it and be satisfied completely, so read other reviews before making your decision."
1,Family members wrote reviews,"First of all I want to say I don't have this book & haven't read it, so can't write a review. But I do know the author & most of these reviews are from family members. Perhaps they are being honest, but somehow I find that unlikely."
1,how to make a fortune with other peoples trash,"This book sucks,,,ok,,ok,,so I have been in the ""junk business"" for over 33 years,,I think most of what anyone does is simply common sense..The info on how to attract sellers to your booth,,put a braided rug under a table,,have a beverage in a ""depression glass pitcher"", offer snacks, like put bonbons out,,,why,,in hot humid weather would you do this??????? get a microphone to announce sales to shoppers??This is insane!! Dont buy this book,,use your head,,if you did buy the book,,dont do anything suggested,,we all sat around at Brimfield this past week and just laughed and shook our heads!"
2,unremarkable introduction to buying and selling secondhand goods,"I've perused this book. I think I bought it at a tag sale for 50 cents or something.If you are absolutely clueless about how to go about buying and selling things this book may be a good start, but really all you need to do is start going to where second-hand things are being sold and observe for yourself. Go to auctions, flee markets, rummage sales.Whatever you do get into buying and selling, it pays to specialize - thus the problem with generalist guides like this one. The specialist knows, sometimes intuitively, but always informed by education and experience, when a thing can be bought and resold profitably. You won't learn that skill from this book, only from refining your specialized knowledge in the field."
3,Compact and strong,"This broadhead wrench is small and compact, easy to carry in the truck for last minute tightening or changing out a new head. Thanks for the quick delivery."
2,not dover's best,"I will not lie, this book has some interesting drawings but from the point of view of a graphic designer most drawings are lacking in graphism. They all are in black and white (with exception of those portrayed on the cover) which I have no problem with; but if you are thinking of reproducing them for logos, decoration, emblems, etc. you will find some dragons unusable since most are awfully complicatedly misdrawn: eyes are often off, lines are shabby, drawings seem childlike and not up to standards with other Dover books of design I have bought. The origin of the drawings is vague and sometimes unexistent, most only state which country they came from and dates are general to entire centuries, no record from where it was taken from or whom drew them, with exception to seven drawings in the whole book. Still if you only want them for looking at it or if you're willing to repair broken lines and seemingly unfinished drawings you should buy it."
3,dragons need enlargement,"For goldwork embroidery which uses large but simple designs, these dragons would need to be greatly enlarged and simplified further. But a useful source anyway and good price."
2,very poor..,"I don't know how good the new edition is.(heard that the south korean national tourism organizationhelped a lot the LP team to revise the new edition)but the last edition is no match for the moon's handbook.go get the moon's one, if you plan to visit this country."
2,Very Lonely Planet with this book...,"The book should not be confused with the tv show, which is consistantly excellent. This is a poor excuse for a LP product, as most of the places, prices, dates are way out of date.It doesn't help that the country is in constant renewal, with regard to restaurant names changing, hotel names changing, etc. But if you can't get the information remotely straight, then you've got no right releasing a book like this and passing it off as accurate.Stick with Rough Guide, as I would have if I had been able to find a copy beforehand. Some nice pictures herein, but that didn't help me much.Incidentally, the reason there isn't much in the way of hangul script is because of the existance of the LP korean phrasebook, which is quite good. It's also separate, so you have to buy both books if you're making a long stay. Money isn't everything, guys."
4,not bad,"Some reviews of this book make it sound terrible. In fact, it's alright. You'll get the cultural and architectural information in much, much greater detail from the Moon Guide to Korea, and I think that's worthwhile. But you'll get lost if you use that guide; LP has better maps and practical information. So, with apologies to your wallet, I suggest getting both. If you're not going to leave Seoul, maybe just buy the Moon Guide and a map of Seoul; but still, you'll be missing LP's very practical recommendations."
2,Poor Resource for Such a Resource-Rich Country,"I was very disappointed with the Lonely Planet Korea guide book both for its poor organization of information and the content. In order to properly tour any one area of Korea, the reader has to flip all over the book in order to find places to eat, sleep and tour. Moreover, any guidebook which wastes ""Places Eat"" space referring to ""Chicky Chicky Fried Chicken"" clearly is missing the point.In addition, pertinent information such as addresses, cost and hours of operation were missing.The authors are described in their biographies as hippie, Deadhead, misguided souls. Clearly this has something to do with the poor job they did compiling this book. I'm definitely moving back to Fodors or Eyewitness."
3,Lonely Planet Korea (4th edition),"Before I begin my review, I would like to preface by stating that I was born in Seoul and raised there until I was 7. It has been six years since my last visit. The book overall is informative. It's probably the best short reading book for a tourist, which is unfortunate. I found some of the information to be incorrect, such as pronunciations of words and cultural observations. The book also gave me an impression that the recommendations made were given by an unsophisticated traveler. Again, it's easy reading and a good summary."
3,generally helpful,"The book is good in giving you info on what to see and how to get around. A lot that is related to Korean culture and its people is not right or a bit off base. The info on the bus system is a bit off including prices and how it works. On the other hand, it does give plenty of info on what to see and is good on describing how you can get from place to place. Overall it gives you a lot of helpful info, but it certainly is not the ""bible"" on korea by any means."
4,"Enjoyed it, only because it was new to me","Since I'm only 21, every essay was new to me. I had read some of the interviews in the book before from other sources, so that was a little disappointing. So if you've been a Chomsky fan for decades now then none of this should be new to you, except the interviews perhaps.So I highly recommend this book to people who are only now beginning to read Chomsky and want a better understanding from which postulates his critique and analysis of our society springs from."
2,Really disappointing - a rehash of old material,"I was really looking forward to this book, but upon receiving it I found that it was simply a compilation of old writings and interviews, most of which are available at various places on the web. The material is not indexed and seems to be just sorted by date. This is no other formal structure to the book. I really feel ripped off."
3,Anarchy of Words,Very hard to read. The author does not communicate well on the written page. He could have pared this down and streamlined it so that it would be easier to read and understand his meaning. A good editor could chop off a good part and reword the rest to present the subject in an interesting and memorable way. Much too wordy. The plethora of unnecessary words and inefficient use of the written language obscures his meaning.JHC
5,Fascinating Book,"I'm not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about. Unlike much of the Chomsky material published these days, there is a significant amount of new material in this book. ""New"" at least in the sense that it's never been published before, or has never been published in English (there's one essay that was published in Ljubljana in 1986 and an amazing Brazilian interview from 1996). I'm a huge fan of Chomsky. I read his work wherever I can find it, but I haven't seen at least five of the chapters in this book...and several of the others aren't all that common.But the real point is that, taken together, these essays and interviews provide a truly fascinating and seldom seen side of a social critic who, admittedly, sometimes seems to be making the same point (however important) over and over. This book is Noam Chomsky at his most exciting: thinking about the possibilities for alternative social forms, rather than simply critiquing the one we've got.Highly recommended!"
3,good for quick reference on pagan religions,"I found this dictionary on the reference shelves of the Highline c.c. library. The dictionary is good for getting a quick reference on the different pantheistic religions of the world. This would be good to have in your collection if you study mythology, or happen to be a fantasy/ fiction writer."
3,First Puzzle,I had this puzzle when I was in school..It helped me get hand and eye coodination..It is a sturdy toy very...hard to break..This is a toy that u can keep it for years..The pictures are great too...
3,5 Star Printing with 1 Star Text,"This is a beautiful book. The maps and illustrations are magnificently reproduced with the superb quality I have come to expect from Italian printers. Unfortunately, the book's usefulness is limited by the text, set in an almost unreadable typeface. Whoever designed this book obviously does not read much. It's a pity. The authors had a lot to say, but it takes a major effort to read it."
1,Dont like the nudity at all,"I feel really bad giving this book a negative review because of Lynne Cherry's environmental efforts, but I want to let you all know in my opinion a very young child doesn't need to be seeing graphic rears and breasts. I may be of a different opinion than anyone else but this book ended up being returned for this reason and I hope the author takes this into consideration in future books."
1,Never Received,"I was charged for this book, received confirmation it had been shipped to the correct address and never received the book."
2,Shamans Apprentice,Book was in Good shape. Content wise I found some of Mark's words to be a bit un-P.C and behind the times. For example the word Shaman is misleading and and often misused . Also they are in the rainforest not India so they should really not be called Indians...Just Saying. ....Seller Good ...Book.... Meh
4,Good,"Did you ever wish that there was an easy way into the recording and producing of music? Well if you have you'll be disappointed to hear that there is no easy way of getting into this shark infested industry, but there is a book that makes the process look simple because it touches all the sensitive subjects that are not discussed in other title. J. S. Rudsenske's book takes you through some vivid examples and show's you the path to fortune with quick and easy to follow steps."
3,Good places but lack of content and small pictures.,"Please read the reviews before buying this book since you might get or not what you are looking for.In my opinion the pictures selected are not bad at all but more than half of them are too small. You'll even find a blank page with a 2"" x 2"" picture on the upright corner, that's bad since the page is not even populated with content about the picture. It's a global tour of some of the trendiest resorts in the globe but once again poorly presented in terms of content and sizes of the pictures selected. When the pictures are not small then it's the angle selected that doesn't give us a whole idea of the space. The only value that I found was the list of locations that could then be visit by internet for more details. I'm giving it 3 out 5 starts since despite all the cons it was not expensive."
1,Completely Overrated- Must Miss!!,"Good topic but poor execution. Its obvious that little time was spent producing this book. Compared to similar books, the pictures of the hotels are quite small, limited in number and not of the best quality. Additionally, there are a number of other resorts listed in the back where the author has merely included a brief description of the resort along with a tiny picture. I was expecting more in-depth coverage of these resorts. Also, the map in the front of the book is wrong. They have mislocated certain resorts- placing resorts in the Indian Ocean on the continent of Africa. Sloppy work!!!"
3,"Great book, IF you plan to refinance your mortgage!","This book is packed with wonderful ideas for kid-friendly rooms, and includes lots of large, colorful photographs. ""Idea Book"" is an appropriate title - no instructions are given. However, unless you are a professional builder or architect, or are willing to refinance your mortgage to pay for a professional, most of these ideas will remain ideas. Some of the painting ideas and color schemes could be useful for someone who is on a budget and is looking for a change."
2,"Dated, Elaborate","I borrowed this book from my library, it seems as if the photography was done in the late 80's. Colors and styles are rather dated for 2008. Also, as others have written, the photos feature extraordinary floor-plans, furniture, built-ins, wood-projects such as back yard kid's play houses, etc. If you're ready to drop a few thousand dollars and would like an 80's theme, you've found your book."
4,Title Says it All,"The book is generally well layed out. Don't expect any plans, you are expected to develop your own ideas and it should help you accomplish this. Overall, the title says it all."
4,I've kept this book for twenty years. It]s that good.,"It's a happy beginning, a sad middle and a solid if sad ending. I like it very much. I also have her trilogy, A REASON FOR GLADNESS, PETER AND THE ROCK, and BRENDAN, about an irish family growing up."
5,This is the best pan I own!,"This pan is the greatest ... perfect for oversized recipes of chili, sauces and braising. AND a great price!"
4,Home Cookin' With Dave's Mom,Here is a book that has all of the recipes of foods enjoyed throughout a babyboomer's lifetime. The chicken casserole is my favorite and it is a standard of mine now. There are a lot of photographs of the finished product and nothing is too esoteric.
5,Dave's an Icon,David Letterman is an Icon and one of the funniest men of our time.I love his mom too and appreciate her Raising such a funny kid.My wife loved the cook book. Thanks DaveLanny Scott
2,pomade,Received product on time. however packing did not come as per the photo showed. Bottle was a bit deeper and in different color.
4,The publisher should reissue this!,"I got lucky and found this book in a local bookstore. I bought it mainly because I was intrigued to discover it was Rupert Everett who wrote this book, and I wanted to see what an actor could do in the world of writing. It's not Christian McLaughlin or Doug Guinan, but ""Hellow Darling"" is enjoyable, and it provides a snappy insight into a world in which rich people aren't quite as secure as the rest of us think they are."
2,it's ok if you want to read about countless over the top drug experiences.......,"....for me,a small handful will do, especially if the style is so breathless a sophomoric attempt at being outrageous and funny.The book is a series of vignettes, more or less linked, often fantastic, and at times, I admit, funny.Before i read this book I had read the later RED CARPETS & OTHER BANANA SKINS, which I rather enjoyed. Everett seems to have gone from sophomore to junior here,and so I found the writing much more enjoyable. It too had lots of drinking, drugs, and gay abandon, but I liked Evertett's handling of the material much better.I must admit I am no fan of his acting. Mostly I find it inept, though in MY BEST FRIEND""S WEDDING I thought it was passable."
4,"It's the written equivalent of ""people watching""...","Filled with colorful characters, funny situations, and a surprisingly strong narative thread, ""Hello Darling"" is a real treat & a great summer read. There's a sick joy in watching a newly broke character still having to mingle with his still high-in-the-hog living friends. Great concept! Great characters!I didn't find all the drug use THAT disturbing because these characters are hardly role models in any way shape or form in the first place. My ONE critique came at the end, where I feel that Everett kinda wimped out...any book that ends with a question mark is well...questionable."
1,I don't agree...,"I really did not find this book enjoyable, in fact I gave up half-way through. It was more confusing than funny and I could not feel any sympathy for the characters. It was just a bunch of caricatures idiotically fumbling their way through a meaningless life... The humor was so far-fetched, and sometimes just too obvious, that the book never even extracted a chuckle out of me. I could see how some people might enjoy it, it did have a lot of extravagance, arrogance and simple lunacy in it... but it did not work for me."
2,REALLY SMALL,These products were super small. The box they come in fit in the palm of my hand so you can imagine how little they are. Not recommended for the price.
2,I'm disappointed,I'm actually a little upset at the quality of this item. It comes in a tiny tiny little box...all miniature versions of the actual product. I expected that it was full-size. The way it is here is really a waste of money
3,Small for price but fast service,I bought this as a gift so I havent personally used this. I got the product and was surprised by the size of the product for the price. Fast shipping.
4,"As far as my 4 year old is concerned, thumbs up","This is a good addition to my 4 year old's DVD libray. It's sweet and age appropriate, and it held his interest. Like all Disney DVDs, you have to get through all the Disney promotions to get to the movie, and this is annoying. Still, the target audience of very young children will enjoy it."
2,Same episodes that are on TV. Very short new episode,I was very disappointed when I watched this DVD with my son. There were 3 episodes and one new one that was very short. The other two I had seen many times on the Disney Channel.
5,MUSIC AT ITS BEST,THE VIDEO WAS EXCELLENT AND SHOWS LATIN MUSIC LIKE ITS SUPPOSE TO BE PRESENTED. GOOD SHIPPING AND SERVICE AND CONDITION.
3,Odern Tap Dictionary,This dictionary was recommended by my tap dancing teacher and I was very excited about getting it. This book has some tips that will help me out but the trust is that it is very confusing to me and it don't give me what I was looking to find out on it.
3,Disappointed with pot,The pot heats well but the holes in the pasta insert are too big and allows a great deal of pasta through to the pot. This defeats the purpose of a pasta pot. The insert also gives the pasta a metalic taste. The insert is highly polished on the outside but not on the inside. This could be the reason for the metallic taste.
1,Waste of money,"This manual has not helped me in any way. I'm still trying to figure out how to manage my website. The book uses technical language and does not explain basic steps on ""how to"". It displays the same pages that are shows in the administrative site without giving any extra help on how to use the various tool options. Extremely Disappointing!"
2,"The only game in town, but this game stinks","This is the only manual for CRE Loaded available at the moment, but it's one of the most confusing and poorly layed out manuals I've ever read. To say it is badly organized is an understatement. To boot, it's also over-priced. The only reason I gave it two stars is that there is no alternative out there at the moment and if you look hard enough you will find a little bit of uiseful information in the book, but not much."
5,Lasted 3 kids and a Day Care!,"I got these magnets as a hand-me-down from my mother who is remarried and has younger children. She got them back in 2007 and gave them to me in 2009 when my youngest brother and sister lost interest in them. They are my sons favorite magnets. We also have some talking ABC ones by L**pfrog and another interactive game magnet so there are some pretty tough contenders and he still prefers these magnets. He now knows all their names from popular tv shows and books. My son will be 3 in August and I was thinking of buying him a fresh set for his birthday because we are missing about half of them at this point. I also own a home daycare so these have gotten a ton of use and most of them are in great condition. I wish they made a set that was ""things that go"" with cars, boats, airplanes, bicycles etc, I would definitely buy it."
4,"So colorful, wish the names of the dinosaurs where on them","I bought these along with a Melissa and Doug puzzle set for my three year old son. They are so colorful and there are more than I expected!I would have loved it if they would have included a list of what each dinosaur is. My kids keep asking me and I have no idea except for TRex and teradactal. I'm not a dino specialist, so this mama could use a little help in that department.That's my personal beef with the product. All three of my kids (age 5 and under) love them. They are beautifully colored and I like that the magnets completely cover the backs of the wooden dinosaurs. They will take over your fridge:)"
2,Sensative Advice? or Insensitive,"I read this book from cover to cover and found Jean Knoll's commentary helpful along with the notes from adoptive parents however I found it very tough to get past the elitist ideology of Mary-Kate Murphy. I found Ms. Murphy to be a political and social bigot. For example on page 34 Murphy wrote ""Of course I knew what racism was. Like every liberal white American it saddened me.""What would you say the inverse would be Ms.Murphy? Are you trying to imply that conservatives are all cross burners? Are you trying to imply conservatives are not angered by bigots?Secondly Ms. Murphy used her own ""white guilt"" as an excuse to exclude black children and chose to leave one more without a parent. That Ms. Murphy is the height of bigotry and racism!CHILDREN ARE OF THE HUMAN RACE NOT SOME CONTRIVED NOTION OF ""RACE"" (by Darwin's definition a sub/ inferior species) BASED ON SOMEBODY'S MELANIN CONCENTRATION. A CHILD, OF ANY COLOR ABOVE ALL DESERVES A HOME!"
4,Still reading...,"What I've read so far has been helpful in the beginning stages of our adoption. Just knowing that we aren't the only ones ""running into roadblocks"" make this journey less stressful."
2,Hutch is top part only--Misleading,"This product is misleading as advertised. It came up in a search for desks. However, it only includes the top part (the shelving), not the desk. To get that whole setup, it's $152.This might be a decent product...if I had a desk...The picture should show the HUTCH SECTION ONLY and not the whole thing unless the product includes the desk."
3,not what i thought i was getting,"So when i went to purchase this item I typed in ""computer desk"" and the mission natural hutch was the second item to show. Well imagine my suprise when i opened it and didn't get a computer desk.. but the shelves to go on a computer desk.Had i know i wasn't getting a computer desk i wouldn't have purchased the selves. The item picture is deceiving as it shows the whole desk and comes up second in the listing for computer desk.Though i will admitt.. the shelves are very pretty."
4,misrepresentation:BEWARE,"The picture is completly misleading..i ordered as a gift and searched desks and this came up..i was expecting item as shown in picture but only got shelves for top of desk..now i just had to pay an additional 150 for desk..i would have ordered something different if i had known that, but the wood is good quality..only positive i can think of right now..lmao"
1,THIS ONE IS A BOMB!,"I have read and enjoyed a number of books by this author. This was a forced, superficial, pathetic attempt at writing. I only finished it - in speed-reading mode - because I wanted to see if the writing improved, even a little bit. It did not. The story was corny, the characters one-dimensional. Usually when I find a book laborious to read, I either don't finish it, or I thumb through it to see the end. I don't write a review like this one. In fact, I have only written one other negative review out of dozens I have posted. However, I felt strongly that I should warn any unsuspecting potential readers."
5,Substance?,"If you are interested in buying this book, please read at least 20 customer comments, negative and positive. If the positive comments strike you as more thought out and less reactive, I urge you to read this extremely interesting book. However, if you find more truth in the idea that Mr. D'Souza and his ilk spend their time writing 600 page essays intent on keeping the black man down, I suggest you close the curtains, turn up the electric blanket, and cry yourself to sleep, listing to latest Andrew Hacker book on tape playing softly in the background."
3,[Three and half stars out of five] Another winner from Dinesh D'Souza,"They are out there; Afro-Centric Bunko artists, Juda Goats [see Willis Carto and Bernard Pi(e)per-Collins, Dave Dukes, others] and dish water-brained liberals.Then it's good that we have men like Dinesh to sort them out and put the hucksters like Morris Dees and Alan Dershowitz's in their place! Bravo Dinesh!"
5,It's Thought Provoking,"Whether you are pro/con, this book is well worth the read because of it's thought provoking nature. This book could be the basis for a new dialogue on race, which is sorely needed since our society apppears to be bogged down in addressing the concerns of both blacks and whites.D'souza supports each of his arguments, never making a declartive statement and letting it stand by itself. The strength of this book is that it is written with scholarly rigor without getting bogged down in scholarly prose. Makes it very accesible to the average reader.The author is speaking here next week, and I'm glad I read this beforehand. I can't say I agree with all of his points, but it is a sorely needed new perspective on the problem of race in this country."
3,Difficult reading,"As a black, though not Afro-American, this book made difficult reading, though sadly one cannot dispute all the findings in this book. The only solace one can get from this book is the general finding that differences in performances between different racial groups is more cultural than genetic."
5,Straight Talk Assessment of America's Race Problems,"The real problem in the ""Racism"" discussion in America is the lack of straight talk. Many Whites believe that racism and discrimination has been completely eliminated in society. By contrast, many Blacks believe that ""racism"" will prevent them from ever succeeding. Of course, racism does and always will exist. Nevertheless, race and ethnicity is no longer the significant problem impeding the progress of the growing underclass. For instance, Black Americans with college diplomas have an unemployment rate of under 4%. And Asian Americans have a higher average per capita income than White Americans. D'Souza agrees that racism does exist but contends that the underclass problems across America have more to do with a lack of cultural emphasis on education and achievement than with ethnic identity. D'Souza's ""The End of Racism"" book should be read by everyone concerned about the racial polarization of America."
3,Has he read the book?,"I have read countless review about various controversial works, but this is my first review. It isn't so much about the book, as about the last review. The author says that D'Souza supports the view that differences in IQ are heredity; but D'Souza explicitly disavows such a view. I wonder how the writer could possibly interpret this from the book. Maybe he just couldn't understand D'Souza.About the book itself, D'Souza makes some good points, but there are many non sequiturs that ordinary readers might not catch."
1,Ugly Racism,It doesn't surprise me that there are racist authors out there willing to pen a book such as this. Nor does it surprise me that there is a publisher willing to profit from sales of a book such as this. What does surprise me is how many people willingly accept such blatent racism as valid scholarship.Flabbergasting.
1,Nonsense,"D'Sousa's country of birth India to this day practices a caste system that treats his Goa tribe as perpetually lower class no matter their accomplishments in life. India has hundreds of millions of dark-skin, downtrodden tribal people. Perhaps he can first start there to end racism."
1,Half-baked Ideas,"Mr. D'Souza expouses half-truths to formulate is characterization of racism in the U.S. He clearly seeks to appease the establishment who funded his work. He claims the Blacks have a pathological (mental) disposition to acclimate them to violence. If you must read it, my advise is to then use it for fireplace fodder."
1,Bigotry in Scholarly Language,"If you sigh, roll your eyes, and shake your face with a knowing smirk whenever you hear about the impact of racism on African Americans, then this book is for you!Like The Turner Diaries, The Bell Curve, and other like books of enlightenment, The End Of Racism will provide you with plenty of revisionist scholarship to reinforce how intelligent and civilized you are at the expense of others.But you already knew that, didn't you."
1,Apology for White Racism,"This guy is nuts! I can give you this review in a nutshell.1. Blacks are dumb.2. Black people contributed little to the world.3. White racism isn't so bad.4. Racism is a myth.5. Slavery wasn't that bad either.That just about sums up this book. He apologizes for America practicing European Imperialism. He even said the book ""The Bell Curve"" made good points! can you believe this guy. America practices White nationalism and this guy is fine with it. White conservatives love guys like him. Since he's a ""person of color"" his argument that racism is a thing of the past--holds more weight. This book is garbage. Take the pages out and use them for toilet paper."
2,Mistaken,Was this book well written? Yes. Was it convincing? No. D'Souza apparently has only met one kind of black person and only knows one kind of white person and it mars the book. Is racism as bad as it was 30 years ago? No. The physical dangers that blacks faced from whites are no longer a daily problem but to say that racism is largely a figment of black imagination is to verge on fantasy.
3,The End of Racism is an idea whose time has not yet come,"Mr.D'Souza obviously came to America when African Americans and other caste members were not being publically lynched for sport and routinely denied even the most fundamental civil rights. Although he makes many valid points in his book it is important to understand that the End of Racism is an idea whose time has not yet come. Therefore those with black, brown, red or yellow skin and poor whites should at least(including Mr.D'Souza) be thankful for the CRA of '64 and for other provisions that make life tolerable in America.MW"
1,"Dinesh, LOOK IN THE MIRROR!","Dinesh D'Souza is of South Indian descent, a people that are originally negroid. Dinesh needs to thank the liberals whose efforts made it possible for individuals like him live a ""normal"" life in America. Dinesh, were it not for the ""liberals"", you would be sitting in the back of the bus with other colored individuals like you!"
5,Political correctness out the window,"I've read this book several times and am amazed how much info is presented and backed up by others. Further, as shown in the book, is that when someone dares speak against the race merchants in the civil rights community, they are branded ""racists"". Many of these reviews criticize others for praising the book by calling them ""racists"". They are in need of growing up. I only wish others would tackle this subject from an objective and truth seeking mindset such as Mr. D' Souza has. Great book!!"
4,It's Six Years Later.....,"It was six years ago that I purchased my hardcover edition, and I am STILL referring this book to people interested in understanding the subject of race and of ""discrimination."" My beloved first edition has been loaned to my Mexican American boss, who stuggles to understand some racial issues.To say this incredible piece of research is merely profound would be to sacrifice it's true nature: to educate. And to see people in this forum still reading and writing about D'Souza six years later is a pure delight to me. I can't wait to see what he writes next..."
1,THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE!,"I've seen Dinesh D'Souza a bunch of times on tv on C-SPAN and on shows like ""Politically Incorrect"" and he's never said anything that made sense to me. THE END OF RACISM is the same old pseudointellectual nonsense D'Souza used to make a name for himself in the 1990s, and proves that he has a limited understanding of race, and of racism. But the amazing thing is that even though he rambles endlessly on tv and in THE END OF RACISM, he keeps showing up on tv, and now people are raving about this book, which just goes to show PT Barnum was right when he said, ""THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE!""Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"
4,Good Collection,"It's a good collection of Japanese classical music, I just wish it contained more classical rather than more contemporary music."
1,Chingy...,"!Heather's Teenage Son!...what a stupid single you've come up with. Wow. Look how much I care about how rich you are. That just proves how full of himself this guy really is. I dunno, maybe the full-length album is better but I highly doubt that. STAY WAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH."
2,Don't buy the series based upon this chapter,"I am looking for an overview series to introduce high school students to the century, decade-by-decade, as the text book does. This video could serve the purpose although I would prefer a bit less time spent on Bonnie and Clyde or Neville Chamberlain and some of the other longer footages as noted in the first reveiw and a bit more on living conditions, cause and effect. Not that Mr Chamberlain or the gunners of the 30's whern't important aspects of life in that time - the footage, and time, was wasted to some degree by less-than succinct monologue.I am especially concerned with the Bismark error. Selection of material always reflects a bias of some sort but gross historical errors in a finished documentary are inexcusable. Since this is part of a series and this is the only one of the series I have access to before I spend school money on the series, this error forces me to keep searching."
3,Bueno,"This brightly colored board book is larger than average and quite sturdy. In easy-to-read font, each page contains one or two sentences in English with the Spanish translation below it or on the opposite page. I took two years of Spanish in high school. So although I am not a native speaker, I attempted to read (and mispronounce!) the Spanish to my daughters. Only 12 pages in length, it serves as an introduction to the primary characters (Dora, Mami, Papi, Backpack, Map, Boots the Monkey, Tico the Squirrel, Benny the Bull, Isa the Iguana, and the ever-so-sneaky Swiper the Fox). Dora and Boots do not go on an actual quest. Thus this book may be too basic for the avid Dora explorer. Try one of the more adventurous books, such as Dora's Rainbow Surprise."
