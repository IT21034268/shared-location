4,space battles are hard to control,"the game is very good, being able to change classes without dying and such, but the flying needs some improvements"
4,Star Wars Battlefront II,This game is great. Lots of missions play any side - Evil Empire or Rebel Alliance. Game arrived quickly and is in good working order. I am pleased with my purchase.
4,battlefront 2,"I think that battle front 2 is really, really fun I could play it for a verey verey VERY long time!!Unlike battle front 1 you can be a jedi. In battle front 2 the way you can be a jedi is if you get a certin number of points points you wil have the jedi for sort out bursts of time. But if you want to change that, go to instint action an go to options on the planet list and chang how long you will have the jedi. So please try battlefront, it's great, you'll love it!!!!"
5,This game rocks,This game deserves all 5 stars totally!! The new space format is great. The most fun format is the Assult on Mos Eisley. All Heros in a deathmatch. This game is definetly worth the $50.
5,star wars battlefront II,good product. It arrived on time and in the exact condition it was promised. Works great - we're happy!
3,not a fan,not a fan of star wars bought it 4my son i dont like it at all but helikes it if u not n2 star wars like me dont buy it
2,Read the fine print...,"If you plan to play it on a LAN network, look again before you buy...apparently does not support LAN play. Now, why would they (not) do that?!"
2,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HATE this game! I absolutly love SWB1, but this game is horrible. Yeah they added some cool stuff like jedi's, new classes and worlds. Also,the new vehicles are good oh, and space battles are fun. the biggest problem is they didn't fix stuff that was bad in the last game. the AI is so horrible, I think your teammates are actually dumber than they were in the last game. of course the enemies are even smarter which is also a bad sign. The campaing is stupid too.good:ummm,jedi's?bad:everything elsescore(out of ten)6.5"
1,this game was broke & made my son cry!!!,"my son saved his allowance & bought this game, it does not work & made him cry...i was under the impression you checked all your games before selling them...very unhappy"
4,This is an awesome game,"Starwars battlefront II is incredible! it's not like Battlefront one where you can kill 124 people in one game. You actually have to fight. Another thing about it is that you don't have to follow a campaign like all the other shoot-em-up games. you can get right into the fight you want to be in and ""cut to the chase"". Space battles are ok, but there not absolutly great either. when i got the game the day it came out and played in the space battle, it took me forever to figure out that you had to destroy the shilds. Now that i know everything about it, it isn't half bad. I say it's so worth the money!"
5,A kid review,"Star wars battlefornt 2 is truly an awesome game. There is so much new stuff!with new characters avaialbe jedi/sith guys + heroes like boba fett and chewbacca, and new planets. although they have new maps, they got rid of all of the old ones, except the ones i didnt like. but i think that is for the better. Some of the new characters are ..... dark trooprer with lightning bolt stuff, imp officer, the magna gaurd, bothan spies w/ incenerators, and clone commanders. also the space is SO coolio. u get in a starfighter/bomber and bomb their critical systems OR land in their hanger (if u get transport vehicles they r mobile comman posts)and get out and use your expolsives to blow them systems up.AWESOME! IF U DONT HAVE IT NOW DRIVE 110 MPH TO THE STORE AND GET IT! WHAT R U DOING JUST SITTING HERE? GO AND GET THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!"
5,fast delivery and great condition,a few laggs in the intro movie but who watches tat deliverd on the first day of estamated delivery in great conditionfew smudges but no scratches so far plays great
3,not bad,"This game is pretty good. If you want a good game get this, it is very addictive. it does have a couple of glitches. but overall I rate it 3 stars beacause it needs a bit more actionbye."
5,rokin,i think this game was of the hook killing thoose imperial troopers was a piece of cake i think everyone who likes starwars/fighing should buy this game......hi mom!
2,How to take a good game and make it worse,"I've been playing this game for some time now and have come to the conclusion that this game is far inferior to the original battlefront. The graphics and environments are often dark with key objects more obscure than the original. The weapons selection and targeting huds are overly informative to the point of distraction. The mapping display actually seems to be less accurate than the original. The ""space"" missions have poor grahics compared to most air/space combat games. More importantly, the flight simulation itself is choppy and not quite up to par when you compare it to much older games such as jedi starfighter. This was a very ambitious effort, but it falls very short. It has been one of the more disappointing star wars sequals. Not a complete loss, but could have been better given the time and effort given to the project."
5,Wonderful,I love this game. I got it for Christmas 1 year ago and it is a cool game. When you play Rise of the Empire you will enjoy it. I think that Hoth is not the hardest level. Coruscant: Knightfall is really fun killing all the jedi. I think that you will enjoy this wonderful game. In Instant action most of the planets are fun to play on. Galactic Conquest is a little sad because you start off with 3 planets and the other group starts off with 11 planets.
2,Not as fun as BF1,"Sorry, but this game doesn't live up to the original. Vehicles like AT-STs handle a lot worse, don't nearly have enough firepower and can be destroyed easily with grenades. Space combat is totally pointless, with an inexhaustable number of enemy fighters, and capital ship turrets that barely scratch enemy capital ships. (What is with the machine gun sfx?) And Jedi are just way too easy to kill. Plus, the HUD on BF1 was so much more user friendly. And friendly AI seems almost nonexistent, especially when I see groups of my own troops just standing around not even moving. And forget about issuing them any commands. This game just seems way too rushed. Should've slowed it down and put more effort into it boys."
5,THE BEST PS2 GAME I EVER PLAYED.,It is a great game. 3rd best game i have ever played (behind saints row for xbox 360 and Kameo elements of power for xbox 360). Everything rox except for if ure being a jedi if u dont kill things u lose life.
2,Too many crashes,"SWBF2 has been released even though it should still be in BETA. Excessive crashes in various areas, BETA software servers and a clear understanding from the gaming community that it was released too early. Buy something else.Check out the LucasArts web site and visit the forum. Even though they are happy to ban people who flame the developers, there are still enough people getting the real message out. This game isn't ready for retail."
1,Belgian Playstation 2,DearWe ordered Star Wars Battle Front II last week and received it correctly. When my son tried to start it up in his play station 2 it did not work. Is this a problem between US discs and european Play Station?What can we do?Thank you for your solution.Rik and Sebastiaan
4,"Great game, but...","..it can be utter chaos at times!! I guess I'm spoiled by Navy Seals where you are in control of your team and can meticulously call the shots. In this game, you are on your own. Your squads don't really do much for you other than get in your way. They get killed so easily. So, it's safe to say that the A.I. for your team is not all that great.What happened with the squad-based commands where you can tell your team to defend, attack, get in, etc. I think they allow that in the first battle front.I love the fact that you can pilot a ship!!! That's great.When I play the game, I try to rely on my men to help out. Now, I just do it myself and I get so much further."
5,Finally - The ultimate Star Wars Game!,"Ok...I've been playing games for nearly 20 years now. Yeah, I'm one of the ""first gen"" gamers. Commodore ring a bell? Well, I have to say that Star Wars BFII is simply the *best* Star Wars game yet.Battlefront I was good, but clunky. The gameplay was fun, but trying to walk around took a really long time and the action choked most of the time.This new release has very smooth gameplay and the space combat maps are so incredible. The explosions are great and the audio is top-notch.I have had major lock-ups however. I went to the site to see if there was any clue/patch but alas there is no listed support for the game. Aside from that, I HIGHLY recommend this game."
5,Rewards for a Rescuer,"As a ""foster"" for a number of dogs, while reading this book, I was able to feel each & every feeling that the author felt with each & every one of her furry friends that she so lovingly cared for. Beautiful short stories that will bring tears to a rescuers eyes!"
4,Very nice knfe for the home cook,"Extremely sharp and light in the hands. Perfect for those with smaller hands (my wife loves them) but those with larger hands may want to look to a larger single knife. Fantastic quality and as always, lightning fast Amazon.com shipment."
3,Not so sharp!,"I bought this knife because of all of the raves of how sharp ceramic knives are and how Kyocera is the leader. Well, I'm sad to say that I paid $20 for the Yoshiblade and it's actually significantly sharper than the Kyocera which cost almost 4X as much. Of course I've only used them both a few times, so maybe there is a quality difference, but a 4X as much quality difference? Yes, I can send the Kyocera back for sharpening, but I can just purchase a couple more Yoshiblades and I'm sure I will have saved money in the long run. The only real advantages that the Kyocera has over the Yoshiblade is that it is 1/2 inch longer and the handle doesn't cover the rear of the blade. Oh yeah, and it's black (advantage?) and is a major name brand. And you can by a set of the more expensive Kyoceras if you have that need. For those that just want to test one out to see if they want ceramic knives, I would suggest you try the cheapest one you can find, first."
4,Sharp enough they will make you bleed.,"My wife loves these knives. I was a little skeptical of the ceramic, but so far they work well and have lasted without any chips or nicks (except on fingers that get in the way)."
5,Pleasure,"They do look like plastic, but are they sharp. Very light. A joy to cut with. The larger knife, cubed a 4lb. roast quick. It was 3 inches thick, and just slid, right thru it. The meat just pealed off the sides of the blade.I felt like a pro butcher. It's amazing how thinly this knife will slice."
2,Nope,"These knives definitely didn't live up to the hype.Pros:1. Blade stays relatively sharp for longer than a metal blade.Cons:1. Very cheap, plastic handles.2. Very light. There is no ""heft"" to these knives and they are poorly balanced.3. Too delicate. When cutting, you can actually feel how you have to be careful with these knives so that they don't break.4. The ones I was sent were not sharper than a very sharp metal knife.If you are a person that likes knives (i.e. a hunter, a good chef, etc.), you will be very disappointed in these knives. You have to cut with them like you're walking on egg shells, they feel and look cheap, and in the end, they're not as sharp as a well sharpened metal knife. You're much better off buying a good metal knife and a good sharpener.The only reason for purchasing these knives is if you don't have a metal knife sharpener, or if you simply don't know, or don't want to sharpen knives."
3,good,I love these only problem is the little one broke just from simple use. really delicate and i don't think it's wroth it to send it in and pay shipping and repair costs.
4,Sharp Sweetness!,"As all other ceramic knives these are very sharp. I like the Kyocera brand a lot, but don't like that I have to send these off to get sharpened if they become dull or chipped to keep the warranty intact."
3,My first ceramic knives,I use the paring knife in my cheese container kept in the fridge. the large one will make it's way to the camper. I don't know if the these are representative of all ceramic knives- if so there is little reason to want more. I could see they would have there purpose. Why have a knife you have to baby or they break? I have experience w/ the better Wusthof and Henkle lines (of the two the Wustof is my preferred. I've heard it said that the Shun's are awesome - so I may fill in with one and have a look.
4,Fun to use - Very sharp,"We got our Kyocera knife in time for Christmas.I used it to make ultra-precise slices of potatoes for au gratin potatoes.It was great!I now use it for almost all precision carving, even meats, after I have taken the meat off the bone.The other day I sliced a tomatoe and then sliced through completely frozen breakfast sausage!!These things are not as fragile as I thought.You do have to be careful not to slice yourself.Thomas - Husband of a Cook"
5,SHARP!,"I have a couple of shun and wustof knives and these are by far the sharpest. Also, they are super easy to clean. Watch for a sale. I bought them on the deal of the day for around $45. Overall great knives and I would buy them again in a heatbeat!"
5,THE Sharpest blade in the drawer,"These knives were such a good buy. I got them from the Amazon Deal of the Day. How lucky! They slice through everything so easily. I could not believe how thin I could slice a garden-fresh tomato. Be very careful, if they slice that easily through tomatoes, your fingers would be just as easy. I hand wash after use and keep them in the box they arrived in. Happy Chopping!!"
2,Chips Easy,"My wife picked these up a few months ago. Boy are they sharp! Glides through almost everything much better than even our top line steel knives. However, while slicing gouda cheese the blade on the Santkou chipped significantly. We looked for the shards fearing that they were mixed in with the cheese but no luck.They will be sent back for refinishing, but I'll stick to my steel knife for hard cheeses."
3,Is sad.,"We LOVED these knives. LOVED THEM. I bought them for my husband for Christmas 2010. After a few months the larger one had a super tiny chip in it, almost invisible. I could only tell because it would get caught on my washcloth when cleaning it. Then in July 2011 the large knife lost a fight with a mango :( Cutting into the mango and when it hit the seed it shattered. A super large chunk just broke off. I checked the warranty but it doesn't cover breaks. We take very good care of our knives and always hand wash them. I'm not sure what we could have done to prevent this. I still use the paring knife daily and love it, with no chips."
2,Disappointed,"When I received these knives, the first thing I did was cut my finger. I thought, wow, these knives are sharp. I loved them an used them all the time. Always washing them by hand. Last week I used the point of the paring knife to remove the paper from the top of a catsup bottle. To my dismay, the entire point broke off. My thought was that I must have put too much pressure on it. Tonight I was using the larger knife to cut a spaghetti squash in half. I pulled the knife out and in the middle of the blade a chip was missing. I pulled the squash apart and inside, sure enough, was the missing chip. I am so disappointed. So I do have to give a negative review."
2,overrated by Oprah,"My husband likes to do a lot of cooking, I bought these for him for Christmas. He said for the price they are way overrated. They are mediocre @ best. Save your money."
1,Dull in 5 months!,"These knives were super sharp at first. However, after only 5 months of very careful use, these are dull. Absolutely NO reason to buy them. Get high quality steel knives! Don't have any info from seller if sharpening is available."
1,OVERPRICED! Despite the HYPE Kyocera are poor performers!,"These knives are OVERPRICED and FRAGILE, especially the tips, which break off easily! Steel is better for durability. Kyocera knives are a fad, not an investment. Don't be fooled! Invest in REAL knives, like ShunShun Classic 8-Inch Chef's Knifeor WusthofWüsthof Gourmet 3-Inch Serrated Paring Knife."
1,not to happy,"My son turned me on the kyocera Knife, he was a prep cheif for resturants in Ft.Worth I ordered this set for a Christmas gift for my sister in Canada, I had it sent to my neice in Michigan, as flying to Canada would be a problem for me. I first saw the set when opening gifts Chrismas, I expected the knives to be larger especially the Santoku knife, the paring knife was just a smaller version of the Santoku knife, not really formed right for being a paring knife. I did purchase 5 single Santoku knives for other family members, ended up giving my sister one of them, along with the so called set."
5,"Gave as a gift, she loves them","I bought myself the cheaper white porcelain knives and gave these as a gift to a friend who is a vegan and chops veggies a lot. She loves them. When mine finally get dull, I'll upgrade to these."
2,Buy a good Henckel kinfe instead,The edge on this pair of knives is ok but not great. A good high carbon steel knife will hold a better edge. The instructions that come with the knives say do NOT use on anything but a wood or plastic cutting surface. It also states that you should not put any pressure on the knife or the edge might break. I find it extremely silly to use a good steel knife to do the major cutting then get one of these to cut the items they are able to. Why use 2 knives when one works and you dont have to worry about it breaking. I also own some of the Henckel twin star series and they are a superior set in every way (also cheaper) and I dont have to worry about forgetting and cutting something on a plate or in a pan and possibly breaking the edge!
3,resharpening the knives,"I was happy using the knife for a short time. Now I still used the knife but it is not as sharp as the first time. I cut meat (Chicken breast) and vegetables. Somehow the knife do not feel as sharp as it used to be. I had this knife since March 2010. I tried to look up for the sharpening services and learned that I have to include the receipt with it. Hello ? how many people actually keeps their receipt if it is a Birthday present? So, guess I just to live with it. It really sucks, dont they keep to their Brand name? and honor the sharpening??"
3,Don't Bother,"Just got this set in the mail. What a huge let down! I immediately compared the brand-new knives to my 3-year old, chipped, well-used $22.99 Yoshi Blade. The Yoshi beat it hands down.The only ""Revolution"" this set caused was the one in my wallet!Go for the Yoshi, folks, go for the Yoshi."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","This is the best knife I have ever used!! I've used my roommate's before I bought my own and I never had a problem injuring my fingers until now... it's super sharp, but that is a good thing! It will cut ANYTHING perfectly! I haven't had problems with it breaking or anything, but I've seen my roommate chip the end of hers. Just be really nice to it."
4,Great knives but had a problem,"I bought a set for my father and he loves them. I love them and they are extremely sharp. Best knives I have ever used. As you can see I wrote there was a problem. I bought another set for my brother in law and his chipped the very first time he used them, Amazon right away sent another set which is awesome but soon after the second set chipped as well. I would have exchanged them again but my sister and brother in law threw them out for some reason."
4,Love the blade hate the handle,"I bought this set for my girlfriend who likes to cook. We are both very impressed with the cutting ability of the knives and will probably stick with ceramic blades going forward. Although the blades are said to be brittle, with normal use and a little common sense, we haven't had any issues. They are extremely sharp and sturdy. I do suspect that a fall onto a tile floor would not end well for the blades. Unfortunately, the molded plastic handles feel cheap and are not all that comfortable. I understand that there are issues with installing handles on ceramic blades, but there must be a better material. You can feel the raised seam that runs down the center of the handles, they are a little slick when wet, and they otherwise look and feel low grade. I would gladly pay more for the same blades with upgraded handles."
1,Absolute junk.,"Opened the box, the screen fell into 4 pieces in my hands. At first I thought this required assembly, but no, it is just poor construction. I'm not sure how it was originally assembled, but obviously not built to last.I would give this zero stars, but it won't let me.I now have to pay return shipping on a completely worthless product.Don't buy from this company! Their products should not even be listed here."
1,Not worth it,"When we received this, we opened the box and it immediately fell apart in my hands. I guess you get what you pay for and I have returned this for a full refund."
1,junk,I'M SORRY I DIDN'T READ THE REVIEWS ON THE PRODUCT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT. IT IS PURE JUNK.IT HASEN'T FALLEN APART BUT I HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL NOT TO MOVE IT.IF THIS THING WEIGHS 10 POUNDS I'M GLAD I'M NOT BUYING BEEF FROM THIS COMPANY.I HAVE USED AMAZON FOR YEARS.THIS IS THE 1ST PRODUCT I'VE EVER BEEN UNHAPPY WITH
2,The epitome of elevator music,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer below. I prefer orchestral or ""tet"" performances, but I wanted something a little less complex for those quieter moments.Honestly, I didn't have high expectations either, considering the price and the fact that there was no mention of who performed the pieces anywere on the box. But even with low expectations in hand, I still found this set to be extremely disappointing.As the reviewer below eluded to, the piano pieces sound like MIDI music. Very hollow and discrete; completely lacking in the richness and fullness of a real piano.The string music, on the other hand, is incomparably better- not great, but pleasant. As was mentioned, it was cool to hear pieces that are usually not played on solo strings being played on solo strings.Even so, I find it hard to recommend this set. I know for the price, it seems tempting, but even $10 is a waste if the cds are just going to collect dust on the shelf (as they will in my case)."
3,HANDBOOK,I WAS SOME DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. THE PRINTING WAS SO FINE. IT WAS LIKE THE BOOK WAS JAMMED TOGETHER TO MAKE IT SMALL. I WAS EXPECTING MORE INFORMATION.NAP
4,Interesting first novel.,"This interesting novel seems to have been a first in the detective genre from Paul Coggins, who has become a noted former U.S. Attorney and criminal defense lawyer since publication of this work. The story line comes alive because of the author's insight into the legal profession, along with his knowledge of criminal and law enforcement types. We can only hope that we hear more from the world of ex-DEA Agent and private eye Steve Dart as he investigates drug dealers, murder, betrayal, corruption and struggles against his own self destructive tendencies."
3,"Sweatshirt, personal",Of barely average quality. It suited the needs though. Girls wear things that are cool and unique so maybe the quality is not an issue. If you want a better product you are going to have to buy a blank sweatshirt and have if embroided. (sp ?)
2,This is NOT a reflector!,"This is not a reflctor, it is a diffuser. It has no ability to reflect at all. When I bought this, I thought it was a reflector and a diffuser, which would be great. I assumed it had a cover that would reflect. It is a decent 1 stop diffuser, but if I would have known that was all I was getting, I would not have purchased this item."
4,Massive and Unwieldly BUT Does the Job Well!,"I tried this out in a mall store and bought it for my husband who is a waiter and of course on his feet alot. It REALLY gives your feet a great ""shiatsu"" massage rolling the sides and soles of your feet with rollers and spheres. I loved the feel, but my husband found it compressed or ""squeezed"" his feet too much. He is also a rugby player and has broken several bones in his feet over the years AND he has wide feet so he found the compression almost painful. If you CAN muscle the ottoman into the proper height and position you can get a GREAT calf and leg massage too. I think that this would give great relief to anyone suffering from restless leg syndrome. My main problem with this item is the space it takes up. If I could have left it out permanently in a den or family room it would have been fine. I don't have such a room though. As it was, I ended giving the ottoman to a friend who has more room and CAN leave it out permanently."
3,iJoy Ottoman,"The massager works very well for being refurbished. I bought it as a present for my mother and she is very satisfied with it. It really helps with the blood circulation in her foot after a long day at work. I also like that way it feels. The only down side I would say is that the little grips on the bottom of the 2.0 keep coming out, but a little crazy clue can solve that problem."
4,works great and easy to use,It's not messy and seems to kill the fleas. I use it on furniture and on the carpet and it works well. The inverted feature is the best.
1,"cheap, cheap delivery system","Ok, I purchased one can, got home........all it did was dribble out of the can, did not spray at all, shook it up, tried to clear any obstructions, still nothing. I returned it for another, same thing..........@ roughly 17.00 a can? Give me a break. Not to mention the wonderful customer service you'll get from the company, crickets.....nothing, no response at all, they could care less if your not happy, like so many others with crappy customer service."
3,Other Favorites,"I like berry flavors but this is just OK, not my fav. I will let friends and relatives try it; they may like it better. Guess green tea suits me more. Not a fan of the pyramid bag either but my first try at this kind. Smells good but just OK taste for me."
1,No Flavor at all.,"I must be doing something wrong because there is ZERO FLAVOR. it sure smells nice, and if it tasted like it smells i'd probably love it. i would love to think perhaps i just got a bad batch..but its 6 boxes all with zero flavor and so was my last batch of 6 boxes of vanilla lipton tea...i am just completely done with any teas from the Lipton brand."
3,Bavarian Wild Berry - Lipton's Euphemism for Apple...,"I really don't have any major complaints about the tea other than its description, Bavarian Wild Berry, and then only because that's not what it tastes like. Actually I don't know what Bavarian Wild Berry tastes like, but I'll get to that shortly. In fact, it tastes like apple. Why? Because that's what the primary fruit ingredient happens to be, followed by blackberry, black currant, and blueberry. Just like buying jam that says it's, oh, let's say blackberry, until you read the label and find its primary ingredient is apple or grape jam. And that's what it tastes like. Here it is in tea form. So exactly what is Bavarian Wild Berry? Near as I can tell, there's no such thing except in the mind of Lipton's marketing department. For the rest of us, this is apple tea."
5,Why pay outrageous prices for store bought bottled tea?,"I love cold tea but hate the price charged for bottled teas. I decided to make my own and Lipton's Bavarian Wild Berry variety works perfectly. I use a ratio of 6 bags to 6 cups of water; I then add Splenda to taste and store in environmentally friendly and safe klean kanteen brand stainless steel bottles. (Hint: if you don't want to buy reusable bottles, save a few of the glass bottles from purchased teas and reuse).I now have all the convenience of the store bought cold tea for a fraction of the cost. Plus no empty bottles (plastic or glass) to recycle.An extra bonus: turns out the smell of this tea while it steeps is wonderfully aromatic!"
5,Best Iced Tea Ever!,"We love this tea all year long, but especially during the summer in our iced tea pot. It has a slightly sweet taste and doesn't need sugar to be delicious!"
1,Tastes good BUT,"the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag."
5,I use this for ice tea...,"I don't like this as a hot tea & wasn't using it up very fast...until...I decided to make ice tea with it. I don't brew my ice tea to be very strong. When I make ice tea using Bavarian Wild Berry, I use 2 or 3 pyramids of Bavarian Berry and 4 or 3 bags of black pekoe tea for a total of 6 bags of tea to make a half-gallon of iced tea; then sweeten it to my taste. It's delicious, the fruit flavor, with a touch of cinnamon, isn't overpowering, it's just enough to make a great glass of berry flavored ice tea. Yum...just the way I like it!"
1,Almost EXPIRED Product Shipped! Boo Moonlittree!!!,"I received Lipton's Bavarian Tea from Moonlittree today. I was VERY disappointed because this disreputable company sent me near-EXPIRED boxes!!! When I buy Lipton's tea from the grocery store or directly from Lipton online, the boxes don't expire for approx TWO YEARS. But half the boxes Moonlittree sent me are expiring in TWO MONTHS. What is it with 3rd party vendors unloading OLD product on Amazon and hoping that customers won't notice??? It's a despicable business practice.The reason I buy in bulk is so I can store the tea for long periods. I don't drink tea every single day and therefore the tea Moonlittree sent me will EXPIRE before I use all the boxes. Ugh. I'm certainly not going to waste my time trying to get a refund. I will simply give Moonlittree a negative rating in the hopes that this company will not be able to dupe any more of Amazon's loyal customers. Boo!"
1,Listen to what every one else says...,"I bought this at a best buy, brought it home unwrapped it and put it on the shelf, when i went to go watch one of the movies, it started skipping half way thru! a brand new disc was skipping! in looking at the other disc i noticed they were scratched as well. I brought it back to best buy in hope to exchange, problem was when we opened another one of the same kind, the discs were scratched too!! so please, don't buy, its waste especially when you have to return, wait till they get smart and use better packaging!"
3,just a heads up.,"Thought I would let people interested in this set, that this item is selling brand new at my local fye(or whatever it is) for 49.99 new. Haven't picked it up yet as I normally get everything cheaper from amazon. But after watching...waiting. still seeing 77ish used. Add to the fact the discs scratching is a crap shoot, might be worth looking off line. And getting a receipt while you're at it."
2,NO THANKS!,"Paramount can stick this where the sun dont shine! This is 2011 nearly 2012 we want Blu-ray release's not dvd's. Fans have spent a shed load of cash, on all the other dvd release's. Now because you have shoved in a cheap plastic mask,you think that makes it ok? Shame on you paramount...shame on you."
3,"Great set, bad sleeves, so-so mask","The deluxe editions of each movie are awesome with some very cool additional special features. The price is phenomenal; less than five dollars a dvd. I'll just reiterate what everyone else has said about the packaging. It is awful, just awful. I consider myself lucky because after scratching up the first disc (still plays though), I was able to get most of the discs out in decent condition. I had some empty dvd boxes laying around, so I placed them in those. So my main recommendation is to purchase dvd cases if you plan to watch the movies more than once. The mask was very cool except for the size. It's like a kids mask or something. Should have been advertised as a ""scaled"" replica. I still would have bought it, but without the disappointment."
3,Rip off alert,Except for the mask this box set is almost exactly the same as the set released a few years ago.
1,Horrible packaging,"Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection (Parts I - VIII + Jason Mask)Yet another box set in which the discs are held, not in cases, but in cardboard sleeves. The first two discs I pulled out were scratched, as all such packaged discs end up due to the recordable side rubbing against the cardboard. Unfortunately, this seems to be a trend with box sets and ""Complete Series"" TV sets. I returned the set before even bothering to check on disc 3. True, the films and extras are very desirable, but I refuse to pay for an inherently defective product."
2,The Ultimate Collection OR The ULTIMATE RIP OFF?!,"Dear Paramount,As a dedicated friday the 13th fan I would like to let you know that you have robbed me out of my hard earned money for this collection series I rename the Ultimate Rip off...I Just received my package today only to discover that Ive paid for a fancy,modernized booklet case that scratches each Individual disc while trying to pull it out from its sleeve...Back In 04,Paramount Released the 1st friday the 13th(From Crystal Lake to Manhattan) edition which was wayyy more pleasing.If your to going to call something ""Deluxe Edition"",make sure It has deluxe Quality!"
1,FAIL!,"We don't want your damned hockey mask, We want to see the x rated versions released! and why the hell are they re-releasing this box set on the old format when this set is in dire need of a Blu Ray release. Please don't waste our time."
4,Bueno en un 80%,"Muy bueno el pack, me encantó. Trae sus buenos extras, la especie de carpeta donde vienen los dvds son novedosas y prácticas. Los ""puntos en contra"" son: que la caja se quiebra muy fácilmente, la recibí con algunos desquebrajos y a medida que abría la caja seguía rompiéndose por los bordes, el material de ésta es pésimo, hay que tratarla con extremo cuidado. Y la máscara que viene incluída es del tamaño de un niño de 3 años, es muy pequeña para un adulto. Aunque está muy bien modelada de acuerdo a la real máscara de Jason."
3,Gift for my son,I bought this as a Christmas for my son. He loves these kinds of movies. I spoke to him and he said the mask was kind of small. He'd already watched the first movie.
3,its ok,they could have done better each dvd should have had its on case...and it should have been a box set...the hockey mask is ok...i already had the first box set...got all the orginal vhs..as a fan of these movies it really could have been better...just wish part 3 had commentary...this prob wont be the last time friday the 13th gets a box set.
1,Packaging Disaster,"As another reviewer described, the book-like holder has tight cardboard sleeves, virtually guaranteeing that the discs will scratch when you remove them. Even worse, however, is that the discs are pressed against the glue of the internal spine. Four of the eight discs, for me, had globs of glue on them after I pulled them out, the kind that likely can only be removed with some kind of solvent - and that would surely damage the discs even more."
1,DO NOT buy this piece of crap set.,"I just got this today, planned on watching these movies on my time off from work and EVERY SNGLE DVD skips because the discs are scratched from the crappy packaging. This is the absolute worst packaging I've ever seen, even worse than the MASH and later Simpsons sets. Why do the companies do this when they know they are just going to get most of them sent back?"
3,directors cuts already!,"this is purely a cash and grab re-re-re-release. if you are easily taken by ""cool"" artwork, then buy this! but i am sick and tired of paramount regurgitating our beloved horror franchise friday the 13th over and over again. it is long over due time for these 80's horror classics to get their long over-due directors cut treatments. paramount, enough of the shame and embarassment concerning these horrorfilms and the mpaa?! stand aside and let the masses have what we want...our friday the 13th film series released uncut and uncensored to dvd, blu ray, and vhs.most of us horror film fans are not fooled!"
1,packaging ruins it,read the other reviews....WHO DESIGNED THIS PACKAGING!!. i returned my walmart purchase. ill wait for the blu ray set (and hopefully in a better set storage then this nightmare). AVOID
3,Where are the uncut versions ?,No blu ray and no uncut versions ? NO THANKS. This is only for those who don't have the 2009 deluxe editions. If u have them then u should pass this by.There's also a booklet included but if u have crystal lake memories u don't need this.
2,Not Good Enough!,"I didn't have huge expectations for this set, and I saw the things posted here. I didn't believe it as true, but it is, the set build is terrible in quality. The people who made this like extra sticky hot glue, but then use is sparingly to seal the package and the book that holds the DVDs, half of the seal was coming apart day 1... The outer description is hot glued on with 2 dots of glue. The Book of DVDs had 1 book separate, all of them were a hot glue maniac with preprinted cardboard, the inside ""pages"" were hot glued to the book.Luckily I got a decent set of dvds vs some of you, only 4 were scratched, and only 1 is that significant, but its ridiculous to see this, the mask is a let down, as I expected it to be my halloween mask... terrible presentation from the start misleading most who bought this (speculation)"
1,Jason must have gotten to these...,"I wonder if the discs heard the ""ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma"" sound before they were hacked to pieces? I've never experienced packaging this bad before. For such an expensive set: $38 for an item that's not bluray, and is that badly damaged is just ridiculous."
1,Fell apart quick,I'm glad I didn't spend much on this since if fell apart so quick. And it never accomplished it's intended purpose of allowing me to use the LCD on my D2x outdoors in bright light--too much light bounced up from under the camera through the open side to cause glare. I missed some obvious problems in the field because of this.I found a much better one with four sides on a German website that replaced this. I'd avoid this product and get the Quenox one that later replaced it.
1,Huge Rip-Off,"Although you can't tell from Amazon's website, the CD jacket contains this disclaimer:""These albums may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artists. Tracks featuring groups may not include all the original members.""To be specific, *ALL* the tracks are re-takes - bad re-takes. Take note that Amazon's return policy disallows returned CDs after the plastic wrapping has been removed. If you buy this one, you're stuck with it.A lesson to read the reviews first, and never shop at Amazon.com."
1,"BEST OF THE 70""S ----- NOT!!","About a month ago, I visited this website looking for a song that I fell in love with as a teenager or even younger. The song is My Maria by BW Stevenson. I am a big music fan and an even bigger music collector. While looking the for this song, I ran accross Best of the 70's which contained a lot of the songs I grew up listening to. I was so excited to order it and could not wait to get it. My only disappointment at the time was that I had to wait a month for its arrival. When it finally got here, as I started to play various songs, especially My Maria, they are not the original recordings. While they are the original artists, it sounded to me like the songs had been re-recorded. I have to admit I was extremely angry because this is not what I thought I had ordered. To even rate this CD with one star is far too generous."
3,I am a Billy Connolly fan.,"I hadn't heard of this movie and was looking for a DVD of Timeline and Amazon recommended this as an additional item, so I ordered it. It is an okay little movie. I am a photographer so I enjoyed watching them build the sets and do the larger images."
5,Suprisingly Superb!,"Truly an eye-opening piece that provided me with great insight into an area that the majority of Americans, myself included, know very little about. After highlighting the struggles faced by high school theater programs, the documentary gave great insight into the many individuals that made each production so special. Well done!"
2,This isn't what your looking for.,"The album has the songs, but it's a live album and the quality isn't very good. So forget it and pay the extra bucks to get the original hit versions."
5,HI BRENDON!,"I am not in any way a country music fan, but even I had to admit that this album was beautiful. Brendon Walmsey has a very stirring voice and the ability to write insightful and touching songs. I've seen quite a few Brendon Walmsley concerts featuring his brothers Nathan and Jared, and I hope they start releasing albums of their own because they are brilliant talents in their own right too.Anyway, this is one of the few albums where EVERY song is worth listening to."
3,Tale by de Vaca himself of his trials in America,"Hard to follow at times, you get confused as to how many people are actually following him! It is sometimes slow reading. Yet, the informantion in the book is good."
1,Disappointing,"While this book started out with a great deal of promise, about half-way through I realized something -- it's poorly written. The plot and concept are great; however, it has the feel of a high school creative writing project, and a mediocre one at that. The characters are thinly written and you really have to force yourself to care about what happens to them."
4,MUY BUENO PARA LAS HERMANAS,"Una mezcla exelente de diferentes ritmos muy al estilo de las Azucar Moreno que pese al paso del tiempo han mantenido su estilo, inclusive cierto tono ironico en canciones como MIRAME Y NO ME TOQUES.Un exelente duo que demostraron una vez mas con este nuevo cd que son algo mas que dos chicas lindas."
3,"Still nice, but now not so much","It is interesting how some music that caught your ear fifteen or twenty years ago, turns out to be mostly dull now. Well, this seems to be the case, at least for me, whit Azucar Moreno. There are some still passable songs in this disc (that does not include any real hit from them), but so far, I find it very dull!"
5,wont be disappointed,"i enjoyed this movie the first time i seen it as a made for tv movie back in the 80's,and seen it on Amazon,and so decided to buy it,i still love watching this movie,doesnt make me feel like i'm in a time warp like some 80's tv shows do."
4,sins of the mother,very good my wife would not stop watching the movie. I got this movie for herand she really enjoyed it so did i. Great for movie night.
4,sins of the mother,"this movie, will make you, respect, the acting proformance of, elizabeth montgomery, aka, samatha stevences."
1,Good movie - would not play in my player.,I bought this hard to find movie in hopes of watching a seldom shown war movie on tv cable. I was dissappointed when the disc would not play in my dvd player so I had to return it for a refund.
1,This is NOT a BorgWarner Item,"E361 is a BWD product. That brand is owned and sold by Standard Motor Products. This part, or any other BWD item, is not affiliated with BorgWarner!"
2,A great idea reduced to a miserable atrocity,"Yes, this game is sadly an atrocity. Anyone who has played the first X Men LEgends would know that the game is actually very fun. Legends 2 is no different. However, there are far too many glitches in this game. Activision should've had a recall. This is just poor programming and testing on the part of Activision. I'm not sure if they would acknowledge it, bu there are far too many glitches. IE: Once you get into hard mode, the game constantly freezes. This is inexcusable. Equally appalling are the other bugs. Jean Grey's Mental Mastery (increases damage done by mental power attacks) does not do anything. Putting points into the last 4 bars of her Dark Phoenix skill doesn't raise its effectiveness by any means.Overall, this is a great game. It has the potential to be very fun. However, the crashing occurs so constantly that you just can't ignore it. I hope Marvel Ultimate Alliance would be much better."
2,"Love X-Men, but the Game Has Too Many Glitches","After great reviews about the game I bought the PS2 for twenty dollars at my local Walmart several years ago. Even though I do like the X-Men, I've only played this game a few time because of the bad animation and the many glitches."
5,Pretty good,Excellent game!Nice graphics with a very good storyline.Very fun game for people of fans of the X-men!
4,Worth Seeing the Second Time Around.,"Back in the eighties, I saw this World War II epic on PBS and am ordering it in September so that my husband can also enjoy it. It is about a British bomb-defusing squad and all the drama and stress endured by the participants. After almost 30 years I don't remember the details, but the haunting memory of the story lives on with me, and also the surprise that I would actually enjoy such a male-centered, as I thought of it then, subject matter. It was just plain good."
5,Excellent series !,"I tried to purchase this set on amazon, but regretfully, it was only available from 3d party sellers and delivery was to take weeks. I ended up purchasing it on barnes and noble and was able to get next day delivery. It was a great series, 200 minutes long, and perfect for a long voyage of one Disc (four episodes) per night. The relationships of the Bomb Detachment and the local civilians was exceptionally well done. Each story brought a new perspective and surprisingly, all of the episodes appeared to be written by different screen writers. This gave a new twist and kept my interest. If you view this series, I hope that you enjoyed it as much as I did. I only wish that the series could have continued. Hopefully, there will be a follow up someday."
4,Very good... til the last.,"This series hooks you and keeps you intrigued with the plot and character development. I was, therefore, extremely disappointed with the last two episodes and how they chose to conclude the series. It was as if the producers (or whoever makes those decisions) sent the writers a message to ""get it wrapped up"". The last two episodes were just not as well-written and I wish the concluding episode would have done a better job of presenting the changing dynamics of the main characters' relationship in a better way. A little different twist on the usual WWII series. I'd recommend it with the above proviso."
4,"Nice reading, but I was hoping for more on dachshunds!!","This was my first introduction to the Melanie Travis mystery series. I enjoyed it! I picked it up because it was about a dachshund, as I have one of my own. I was a bit disappointed because there were few mentions of dachshunds and tons of mentions of poodles and dog shows. I did learn quite a bit about the life of poodles and dog shows, though! I see that the author owns six poodles (per the book jacket) so it all makes sense. I guess if I want to read more about doxies like this, I need to find an author who owns doxies! :)Overall, the book was a nice paced mystery and kept my attention at all times. I see that the series are all about dogs, which I think is great! There is just enough romance and relationship plots as well to keep me happy. I plan to read some more of this series."
5,A Wonderful Novel,"Colm Fox MA, A retired History teacher and author, October 13, 2003,A wonderful novelIt had great historic spread from the Veldt of South Africa, to the carnage of the Somme and the troubles in Ireland. This was told on various levels; the coming of age in 19th century Derry, with its social conflicts and inherent divisions, the ambitions of a working class boy to acheive social fulfillment,and a heartening love story across the sectarian divide. This was all created against a thoroughly researched historical background with acutely observed detail in both the Boer war and the great war. This novel had great pace, which kept me wanting to know what happened next combined with excellent characterisation in depth, and lively dialogue."
5,it is so cooooool album,"it is so so cool album ,, i like all song by amr diab ,, not in this album ,,, but in every album by Amr Diab ,, king of song."
2,Was great til the legs fell off,"I was thrilled to find this fit in my 10 quart stock pot just perfectly. It has been a wonderful tool during canning. Lasted me about 3 years, and then the legs fell off. I'm still using it, but it was much nicer with the legs. Unfortunately I can't afford to replace all my canning supplies every 3 years (seems like they're all cheaper these days and don't last a lifetime like my mother's supplies did)."
5,Great product,We use this for processing vegetables from the garden for freezing because they allow the boiling water to reach all sides more evenly than most steamers. I bought two and they work wonderfully. I have since found many other uses for them as well.Well made and a very good value.
2,Far too big for everyday purposes,"I bought this steamer to steam veggies for our family. It is absolutely huge - it didn't fit into any of my pots except the big soup pot, and even then the lid wouldn't go on. Had to return it and pay for return postage - have a close look at the measurements before you order because the picture is misleading. Would have been perfect if it were half or two thirds the size."
3,taller and stiffer than others,"Unlike the products seen on tv, this strainer is rigid and quite tall, limiting the pots I can use it with. I like it in theory, but don't know that it was worth buying...I do love it for fresh pasta."
2,"Nice Quality, Too Large","Unfortunately, this product is quite a bit larger than what I had hoped. The quality is excellent and I would have absolutely LOVED the product had it been smaller. No fault by the seller though, hopefully, they will be able to offer different sizes in the future."
1,bad product,"it was junk, returned with no problem. It arrived in a GOOD BOX but was damaged inside. Never want to deal with this co. again"
5,Small Batch brewer's paradise,I use this strainer for 1 gallon homebrew beer. It's been a great addition to my kitchen and wouldn't hesitate in recommending this to anyone.
2,Wonderful item for 5 weeks,"and then it broke, that is, one of the spines detached from the outer upper rim. Since I don't have a soldering iron, I guess I'll have to live with it for a while longer since my blanching season is not yet finished. Unfortunately, the 30 day warranty has just passed."
3,I was not mad about anything!,"I was just not feeling this book, at all! I did not like neither character, Mo or Reggie. I liked the storyline though. I love it when two people get together when that person is not their norm! But I guess the bottom line was that there was to much insecurity in this novel for me to handle and then it just ends, what's up with that!! I know insecurity is a real to life issue, but this book was pushing it. I mean if both people in a relationship is insecure about something that they see within themselves how is that relationship going to work! But of course, this is just my opinion on the matter!"
3,Somewhat Hard,"This is my second book by this author, and I muat say that I had a hard time reading this book. It was a good story line but it was kind of slow. She focused alot of attention on Reggie's and Langston's low self-esteem. The chemistry between them was strong. They both had to overcome their personal issues before they could truly love each other.Slow but a good book."
2,Doesn't make clean cut,"I returned this set because I couldn't get a clean cut at the bottom and I have a lot of cuts to do and glue doesn't hold well on rough surface. I bought the Freud set and it works better although not perfectly. Much better though. The Mibro is more difficult to set up and the price has gone up. If you need clean cuts and don't want to be sanding skip this set, imo.I would question whether it was me or the blades if the other set didn't work so well out of the box."
1,A worthless tool!,Over the years the only tools that I have regretted buying were cheap ones. This one is no exception. The holes on all of the shims are about 1/16 of an inch too large which means they are able to fall into the threads of the arbor. I have just spent the better part of an hour trying to set up for one dado cut and have decided that it is just not worth it. This dado blade is going in the trash because I would not wish it on anyone else.
5,Works well,Exactly what I needed. I do some light woodworking and this blade does just what I needed. Delivers smooth cuts and the price was great.
1,Don't waste your money on this item.,I have used several Dadoes. I had high hopes for this product but I should have listened to the 1 star reviews. This is truly a piece of junk and dangerous too. I installed the dado for the first time and was making some 1/4 inch cuts 3/8 inch deep. Shouldn't been too much of a strain there. I ran 180 inches of stock and upon inspecting the new dado blade noticed that one of the carbide teeth was missing. If I could give it a minus star I would.
4,Great Dado Set for the price,I used it on my skil table saw. I first used it without shims and got uneven cuts. I figured out in my second time and it has given me near perfect results. The box i received it in was broken and i had to put some gorilla tape on it to store the blades in it. That is why i am giving it 4 stars. Highly recommended.
4,Decent... surprisingly decent...,"I was surprised at how well this worked.. If you've used a stacked dado set before, the setup is just as easy as any other.. chippers are solid and well marked... nice variety of shims that come with it... well written instructions... I've only used it on some 3/4in MDF and it held up very well..."
5,amazing! lovely!,this is the best book I've seen ever! with a lot of details and all of them very cute! with papaer figures (characters) of santa claus and others. it's really very beautiful and very well done!
4,Great horror classic!,"I loved this film when I first bought it as a VHS, so when my son grew up and married he asked for a DVD copy of his own. It truly is a kid's horror classic and fulfills all those terrible nightmares most kids have. Yes, in today's world of brilliant SFX and computer graphics this would come off as being somewhat lame, but to trip down memory lane it is well worth buying. Fun, adventurous, suspenseful, and full of action, this is a great little horror film with some darn good acting for its' time."
2,Review,This was a required text book. The reading was long and hard. If you do not need to read it then don't it was truly another boring book.
1,"no Bret, no good","Without Bret Hoffman, there is no point in listening to Malevolent Creation. Period."
1,Beginner's workout,"I would not recommend this DVD for intermediate or even for a beginner that has done some Pilates , even for a few weeks or so. The exercises are not challenging at all (not even at a beginner's level), they mainy focus on breathing techniques which you can easily find in any other workouts that are also trying to accomplish some results (body sculpting/toning). I only recommend this DVD for those who never worked out or those recovering from injuries. I am planning on tossing this DVD , only watched it once and could not find anything I might be interested in. Complete waste of money , if you were to ask me ."
3,"30 minutes, not bad","In my opinion, one shouldn't do pilates with a DVD without first learning the basics in person from a qualified instructor. There are just too many details to get right, and an instructor can see mistakes and correct them. That said, this is a pretty good beginner-level pilates workout.Pros:--beautiful setting, good production quality, easy to understand instructions--30 minute workout is very convenientCons:--doesn't begin with the 100--doesn't have a full 100--doesn't include the full series of five.--includes swan dive (modified) which seems too advanced for this DVD. (and series of five should definitely be included over swan dive!)Overall I'm satisfied, but still looking for a more ""purist"" version of a mat workout at home."
1,Not as advertised,"This is advertised as the powerhouse workout, but when the DVD starts Jillian states that it is A.M. pilates. Gaiam just took an existing DVD workout and then marketed it as something else. It is bad business practice. Besides that, it isn't much of a powerhouse workout, and disn't raise my heartrate. I would recommend it for very out of shape people or beginners to pilates. It does offer some of the meditative/spiritual side of pilates, but not good for a workout."
4,Brainfreaky,"In typical Animal Collective fashion a visual album is released where only a third is watchable. I dig it; don't get me wrong. Mostly in-jokes and old-schoolio horror movie ploys though that, although the cheesy effects and costumes and looks-of-the-face tend to pull you out, somehow works as some sort of mindgarbledmesh of an album. The point is that it *is* a visual album, and like an album there may be themes that run throughout, but ultimately what the viewer perceives directly isn't necessarily interconnected. I wouldn't really recommend this to many people outside those of Animal Collective's reach. That's probably the only reason I liked this."
2,It was so dry,I was so bored and I was really looking forward to help as I just started stamping. It was no fun at all and it should have been!
2,Great Stories--Horribly Cheap Presentation!,"Batman=Awesome. There is no disputing that. And these early stories from the 40's are awesome. No doubting that, I give it 5 stars. What really SUCKS about this edition is how awful the presentation is--the worst part being the coloring. I know that comics are colored on computer now, but this thing literally looks like it was colored with Microsoft Paint!! There are pixelated edges where colors run together and there is one especially crappy looking panel with Bruce Wayne wearing a blue pin-stripe coat. It looks like they used the ""line"" tool to color the stripes onto the coat, it's so bad! In the ""Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told"" collection, there is a reprinting of the Evil Monk story, and you can see how much nicer of a color job they did there compared to this crap. Also, the format is so low-budget that when I tossed this book down on my bed, all the pages popped out from the cover! RRRggh. I love the stories, but this book is worth $1."
5,Awesome,"Great product, but be warned! Several of the following volumes are out of print! Difficult to find at reasonable prices! Though there does seem to be hope, as my Vol. 1 appears to be a re-issue (as evidence by the awful new DC logo on the front). Hopefully the will hurry up!"
5,Enjoyable!!,"Though a big fan of Konigsburgs other works (like many of the other reviewers) I thouroughly enjoyed this book (unlike those reviwers)! Maybe it's just my love of characters that made me love this book, but I was increadibly pleased. It's a very strange and out-of-the-blue plot, I'll admit, but Konigsburg, like always, manages to pull it all together into a story of friendship and love between some very different people. I'd recommend this book for just a joy-read rather than using it for any type of book project becuause the deeper meanings are buried way in there. Hope you enjoy!"
3,World's Best Dad!,"Young Max is furious that his mother has dumped him on his camel-driving father for the summer, while she is off honeymooning with a much older husband. Barely civil to his eager fatherbecause of his vagabond existence and his lowlife companions,Max learns more valuable lessons on the road than he did at the fancy private school he attends.As he makes the rounds of malls, fairs and conventions with his father, Max discovers how to identify Real people from the cons and the snobs--how to sort out the freaks from the phonies. But will he ever become comfortable with the fact that his father is just a regular guy with an usual lifestyle? He struggles to accept a broader definition of Family. A clever story which will entertain middle school readers."
3,SAS Survival for who,"The SAS Survival guide is an ok book its size makes a nice travel companion but who needs to know some of the info in it. It can give slilly common sense info such as ""If you can see th waves of a Tsunami you are too close."" Who doesn't already know that. If you like to look at pictures and can figure how to make the stuff they show from only pictures tis is the book for you if not find another one."
2,not what I was hoping for,"I began this book with high hopes, being an obsessive admirer of fall foliage. I was soon disappointed, however, when I realized that the author may as well have been instructing a cub scout meeting. Very little information and inadequate pictures, next to no science at all. Big let-down. I'm glad I bought the cheapest copy available!"
4,If you purchased for the photos...,You did well with this book. Some great photos taken in this book; well worth the price (new/used from Amazon).
4,"Does good job, but smokes batteries","I'm just now getting around to this review. I bought it back in the summer of 2005. As I recall, I bought it because it was the only one that told you if a net was encrypted or not, afterall, no need to waste time trying to hunt down and log onto nets that are encrypted.The only downside is that it rips through the batteries pretty quick. And I think it does it even when it's powered off, so I recommend always removing the batteries once you're done with it. Maybe newer models don't have this problem."
4,Cool Hotspotter,"Just got my ""Canary"", and I am very pleased! Drove up to a church, a diner, a coffee cafe, triggered the Canary, and voila, found an ""open"" (free) WiFi connection at all three places.This neat device would rate five stars except for two points. The lcd data screen is unreadable in low light, and the ergonomics of the device could be improved: the start button should be to the front of the device rather than at the rear; and the lanyard ring should be at the rear of the device (and upsized a bit) rather than on the front end."
4,Fun with a button,"It is fun to use this as you walk or drive around and see all the open networks, with default names and presumably admin passwords, that people have set up. Also nice to see channel numbers, in case you want to change yours. A few small problems:1. Button on the front gets pressed in your pocket or bag, harming battery life (mine said ""low battery"" shortly after purchase).2. It showed nothing at Logan airport, but when I fired up my laptop there was a very strong signal.3. Text scrolls quite slowly. Also, you press button again to see next network -- would be nice if it said total found up front."
2,Not as good as the gifted kapok I received.,"My friend gave me her excess kapok. She was retiring her upholstery business. When I needed more, I found it on Amazon, first site that came up on my search. It was not as clean as the first kapok I had, with bits of seed pod, string and was shorter in staple length. Sorry Charlie!"
4,Organization Change,Very good book if you are interested in human resource. Shows lots of good examples and is very easy to read and understand.
1,I'm concerned about the relevancy!,"Although the book gives a lot of helpful tips about organizational development, I find it kinda irrelevant reading. Thus, I read the first edition of the book and checked what's been changed in this new edition. However, it seems like there is nothing new with newer editions except the book cover :) It's like joke! How come a professor doesn't change his opinion or suggestions 10 years later? Only read the final section of the book and see 10 years earlier edition, it has the same recommendations!"
1,way out in left field,I honestly think this is one of the most poorly written texts I've ever read. The author assumes you've read every piece of literature he mentions.
3,There has to be something better then this book,I had to buy this book and use it for a class. I find the book to be filled with a wide range of simple common sense theories. It is not a book I would recommend to anyone if they are looking for clear and valuable techniques to utilize there has to be something better then this.
4,Very Satisfied,"The book is in very good condition. I don't mind highlighting in the book, I prefer it."
2,"Very basic, similar styles, good for beginners.","Being a very experienced sewer of clothes, I was very disappointed in the very basic and simple content of this book. Some styles look ""home made"" to me. Most of the dresses are very similar except for collar or waist line variations. It is a VERY good book for someone who is new to sewing and wants to make some simple and comfortable to wear dresses."
5,Great Treatise on the Emotions,"Dr. Baars' work is a wonderful examination of emotions, with a Christian/Thomist twist. A great read, especially for Christians who desire a better understanding of the emotions and want a way to integrate and use them more maturely in life. Anything by Dr. Baars is good, but this book is particularly wonderful. He avoids using too much technical language, and explains the concepts thoroughly. This is definitely for the average reader, and I will recommend it to anyone wanting to know more about Christian psychology."
3,"Not bad, can't hurt, interesting, but not much help for me.","I expected the therapeutic ideas in this book to be primarily based upon Dr Baars' Affirmation Theory. Instead it is a Q & A format, and a rather stilted one (these are obviously not questions from patients, but made up for the flow of the book), on a range of psycho-emotional and sexual issues. It is not what I wanted, but it's not a bad book. I hoped it would be a ""do-it-yourself"" application of affirmation theory. But it does touch on that as well as the broad range of what emotions and feelings are, how we repress them, how they affect us, and ways to cope. It is very accurate and clear on some of these subjects which get muddled in ""popular"" psychology and self-help books and programs. Good for a beginner who wants to learn these concepts. It is rather dated with a clear Freudian strain, but has been revised nicely and has good input from a religious and psychological perspective in this updated version."
2,Pads rupture and comfort gel dribbles onto floor!,"Attached this seat to a Home exercycle. We give it light to moderate use. Within 2 months one gel capsule sprung a tear, which widened and began to spill gel out on the floor. I thought this was just an unlucky anomaly, until at four months the other gel pad opened at the rear seam, widened to a 3 inch gap, and also began spilling the sticky gel onto the floor. We are not heavyweight people! The gel pad system on this Ultimate comfort seat is faulty."
2,Not as comfortable as it appears...not durable either....,"I bought this about two years ago thinking it would be a nice upgrade to the seat that came on my bicycle....I was wrong. I could tell very little difference. From looking at it you would think that the gel pads would make a big difference, but they really don't. And then, to add insult to injury...or maybe insult to severe discomfort is more appropriate...one of the gel pads fell off. They are only glued on and not very well at that. If you are on the quest for a comfortable ride where it counts, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,Not As Comfortable As it Looks,"After using this for a season, I have to say that it's just nowhere near as painless to use as it looks like it should be, and very little improvement over the saddles it replaced. I've adjusted it every way I can, but it makes no significant difference.The way I'm built, the padding just doesn't seem to be in the right places to relieve the pressure and pain I experience. Fit seems to be the big issue with any seat, and I suppose this seemingly nice seat just doesn't fit me.The blue elastomer ""springs"" don't seem to absorb very much road shock, either.The gel sacs haven't ruptured (as other reviewers have complained), but I have only used the saddle for maybe forty or fifty miles, total."
4,Comfy,"Okay, it hurt--my 25 year old small, sleek Italian bicycle seat--my personal seat is a bit larger than it was 25 years ago or my bones more sensitive. Anyway the Bell GelTech doesn't look that large on my bike and it is more comfortable and the price was great."
1,Poorly made,"Judging from the photo here, Bell got enough complaints about the completely non-functional ""spring suspension (on the one I bought 5 years ago)"" that they changed it, so maybe on the current incarnation of this saddle, the springs actually WORK. However, I share the same complaint about the melting splitting gel pads as the other negative reviews here.Best advice...look elsewhere."
4,Good Overall Seat,I'm fairly large and bought this seat to get some added comfort. The seat seems to be good quality and overall I like it. I was expecting it to somewhat more padded and comfortable than it actually is.
1,not very good,"This seat came apart after riding on it just 4 or 5 times! I was not happy with it at all. The reason I bought it in the first place is because I liked the design. True,it was nice and cushy but the gel pads came right off and the attempt to glue it with some strong glue failed as it came apart again."
3,good bike seat,Very comfortable bike seat like the ones before the banana seats on the stingrays(for those of you who can remember back that far)
3,So-so,"I bought this seat right after buying my bike. I don't ride that often, maybe a dozen times a year. This seat is comfortable for the most part. It's definitely much more comfortable that my bike's original seat. Now, after about 4 years, the gel pads have started coming off the seat. Being the cheap SOB that I am, my seat is now wrapped with duct tape. I will get another seat soon but, right now, I'm just riding with my 4 year old. I don't hate this seat but I don't love it either. It did serve it's purpose for a while."
2,its alright...,after about 8 months or so the gel began to lift from the seat. It was very sticky so I just peeled the rest and was left with just the seat. im now shopping for a more comfortable seat.
1,Cheap and crappy!,"I bought this seat thinking it would comfortable and wide. Although the width is nice, the gel sucks! The gel pads felt soft but once you sit on it there is no cushioning. Within the first 3 months of use, one of the gel pads split. I taped it but the other side burst within 2 weeks! I taped it again and the gel pads eventually fell off a couple of weeks later! I'm not a large person so weight was not an issue. It's not worth the money. Don't buy this crappy seat."
2,Giant sponge.,"This seat is not the best choice. My girlfriend and I each got one for our bikes for the summer and they worked great a couple times. Going to college, bikes are a great mode of transportation however these seats weren't up to par. Both of our bikes got rained on in a brief summer shower and both seats absorbed so much water it took days for them to dry out. Even when it looked dry, when you pressed on the seat water poured out of it. This is something of an inconvenience when one returns from a 1 hour long class to find a soaked bicycle seat. If you own this seat or are thinking of buying one, make sure to cover it with a plastic bag."
4,I like it. I took a blind chance and was very satisfied.,"Great album! It sounds like a cross between Alice in Chains acoustic and Dada. If you're in the mood for acoustic guitar and lots of 2 part vocal harmonies then this is the CD for you. Why did I only give it 4 stars? Because, although the drums are played well, the drums sound awful(especially considering Jonathan Mover played them!) Low budget drum sounds aren't for me but otherwise these are great songs."
5,Outstanding new band.,"Impressive debut album with new, unique sound. Highly recommend people give this one a shot."
2,Tired,"Neil Peart is tired. He gave us great music and influential drumming for decades. This DVD is boring and looks more like what a kid does in his bedroom when he is just screwing around after school.Peart deserves the credit he gets for performances on albums like Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Exit Stage Left..., Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and those tours. But in my personal opinion the man has nothing left in the tank.I have seen this solo done in various presentations since the Hold Your Fire tour. Nothing changes tour to tour with the exception of the same parts being rearranged.So if you want to spend an afternoon watching a guy warm up and going out of his way to do nothing then this is your dream package. If you want to be inspired by drummers who go out of their way to bring something exciting, new, fresh, and truly goes to the max with his playing...then I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,Neil Peart is the most geniune unassuming music man.,"I purchased this because I have yet to see Rush in concert.These 3 brothers that make up Rush have given us some of the most brilliantly written and preformed music.I can't believe 30 years have passed since Neil joined in 1974.All I can think when I watch him pound on his drums is, ""How does he do that""?What a Rush.I recommend it for all fans of drummers and Rush fans alike."
4,great DVD,"very nice DVD, so complete and very good quality images and sounds. Very interesting the explanations that Neil Peart gives in his compositions of ""drum Solo""."
5,A perfect choice for beginning exercisers.,"Shannon Holand's time-lapsed exercise video is designed for overweight and de-conditioned folks who need a special easy program with invigorating music and an easy program. The program key here is 100 beats per minute with a very simple choreography spiced with a variety of moves, making GOING GOING GONE! A perfect choice for beginning exercisers.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,A very poorly executed video.,This video looks very home made and the music is not in sync with the person who is doing the stepping.Very disappointing!!!!! And hard to follow. Save your money.
2,Meh.,"It is a book of recipes involving both macaroni and cheese, so I guess there's that. But most of the recipes in the book are not things you would identify as ""mac and cheese"" if they were placed in front of you. I make a lot of mac and cheese, and didn't find a single recipe in this book I was interested in trying."
4,Sure are a lot of different cheeses in this world!,"I purchased this book purely out of curiosity. I wanted to know how many different ways one could possibly make macaroni and cheese--because I only knew of two, and one of those involved a blue box!This book is great for mac 'n cheese lovers, because it illustrates ubiquitous variations on the typical mac. If you want a culinary adventure, this would be the book for you."
4,Complete covers everything,These books cover everything from scientific names to places. It is heavey on bigfoots from around the world and overlaps some on them but all in all a good read if your into the science part of cryptozoology.There are stories in the book about sightings but this is not a pure sightings book it is more about cataloging the cryptids.
2,Good start point.,"The book gives a good glimps of info design, good for those who are starting from zero and want to know what info design is, the book does not represent the complexity of the field or its broad application possibilities."
1,WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING???,"Brain,Ler,I love you guys to death but come on! By listening to this CD, you can tell that they had put no effort into thier music by not exposing any of thier talent. All the primus fans would know what I'm talking about. These guys have a lot of skill, and unfortunately, non of it was portrayed in this album."
2,Mediocre,"For the first hour this game is fun. The AI does not scale for SH*T!. In the higher end classes, even sprinters with up to 1/3 less hp will own your ass; and forget about circuit racing.. competitors will bump and wreck your ass while YOU loose rep points, and cash having to repair your car. If you are curious about this title.. save your cash and pirate this sh*t, as it is not worth the money. I truly wish I had purchased chess or anything other than this tripe. Hey THQ, beta much?"
3,Not good enough,"This game has had numerous delays including not having a publisher for over a year. It is late to market yet plays like it is 2 years old. Having tried *ALL* of the recent racing titles my favorite is still Need For Speed Underground 2. NFSU2 has its faults, but it is still the best of the bunch in this genre."
5,Juiced,"This is a good racing game for older computers. the graphics cant compete with the new games, but the game is still fun."
1,not well built,"Although the finish was beautiful and, had they fit together, they would've been exactly what I wanted, the largest of the three had two out of the four legs that wouldn't fit together as they should. Even after various fixit attempts like trying to glue it with carpenter glue, etc., the largest table is virtually unusable- the two offending legs wobble and even fall out on occasion."
2,"Too much orchestra, too little voice","Sweet but thin vocals, oft times overshadowed by the orchestra. I had hoped for a range, at times, beyond the ultimate soprano. After three run-throughs, I have tired of the helium voice. Give me Sinead O'Connor any day for Celtic music."
3,Chloe's Concern.,I hope Chloe Agnew's management realizes that Right-wing pundits and White Supremicistsare using her music and image to promote thier cause.They should be concerned about thisbecause it gives the view that she condones such actions.Go on YouTube and look foryourself.Don't take my word for it!!
5,Supreme and sublime,"I remember seeing 'The Snowman"" on public TV in the USA many years ago, but never could find the video or soundtrack. Whether she was the original voice on the animated film (or not. I don't care). she brought the same feelings and tears to my eyes as I experienced years ago. What a delight to hear the clean, pure voice of an angel!"
5,Walking in the Air,"I love celtic based music but listen to classical, some rock, country, christian pop,.. a little of everything. This one I listen to at least once a week and never tire of the title song Walking in the Air. Reminds of my trip to Scotland and the countryside we drove across. Lovely. One you can listen to over and over,.... and I do."
5,Captivating,"Chloe Agnew is a marvelous singer, and this album exemplifies her talent. Angelic shall always be the best adjective to describe this exceptionally talented young woman with a wondrous future. In fact, she has me so entranced I have to admit I'm in love with her!!"
3,her voice is too thin...,"Her voice not as satisfied as I expected. Bought this because I want the first song:walking in the air. Her voice is good for this song, but for the rest of the songs, I think her voice is a little too thin, no strong emotion to support it."
1,Weak voice with a big ego!,I have but one questions to ask: Who bought her the spot with some truly talented women and performers? She has a weak and so-so voice.
2,I do love her voice,"Chloe's vice is soft, beautiful, absolutely amazing, The songs were kind of tired, same old songs different artist. Wish someone within her venuecould have chosen some better pieces for her."
4,good sportswear,"I purchased this tank from amazon and after wearing for almost a month, my overall rating for it is 4 stars. I ordered a small and found that the cut is not really tight (compared to other stretch/rib tanks and tops I have). The tank did not shrink after it was washed which indicates that the fabric is of good quality. However, I found that the length is a little on the short side. With yoga pants it looks ok in length, but when i wore it once with my low rise jeans, it looked a little short. Overall, for sportswear, it is a nice product at an affordable price."
2,Out of all the great songs on Futureperfect...,"VNV is responsible for some of the greatest club mixes in the last couple of years...So it is odd that the mix of their own song would be so phoned in. This is the most forgetable song on Futureperfect. They could have had three or four really strong singles from that album, and they put out GENESIS?! Why? The first fifteen seconds are great, with the inspiring astronaut voice sample and the future pop bubbling in the background...but then it degenerates into a limp, meandering, simpering that is as flacid as it is meaningless. WHY WHY WHY didn't Beloved get a US single? EPICENTERE?!!! NO single...instead we get TWO singles for Genesis? it's no wonder the industrial scene is so sad in the United States. Don't buy this single...save up and find a copy of Burning Empires if you need VNV mixes."
3,"simon, play your violin more!!","having been a big fan of simon house, i was really excited to get this cd. i have always enjoyed his violin work in all the bands he has played in. the cd has some hawkwind material and hawkwind-type music. but i was disappointed in that it was mostly electronic, with his violin work as secondary. there is nothing wrong with that, the cd is a cross between hawkwind and ambient rock, but i wanted to hear predominately more of his violin work. evidentally, he plays all the music on the cd, which is a wide variety of keyboard/computer stuff. so if you have enjoyed simon's violin solo's and playing of past recordings, you'll probably be disappointed. if you want something to compliment your hawkwind collection, this release is alright. frank zappa did a solo release called ""shut up and play yer guitar."" i would like simon to minimize the electronic/computer stuff and focus on this talented violin work."
3,"Good, but...","...not quite as interesting as ""Time Travelling Blues"" or ""Frequencies From Planet Ten"". This album isn't as ""spacey"" sounding as their previous efforts, but it does have some very good moments, and plenty of heavy guitar riffs and effects. I for one, mourn the omission of the keyboards on this outing. The better tracks are; ""Scorpionica"", ""Hot Magic, Red Planet"", ""Cozmo Bozo"", and the title track. Still a good album, though. If you like the goblins, you'll certainly enjoy this one..."
2,Ugh...I really don't recommend this book,"It's really disspointing to see that John Lescroart was trying to emmulate the style and finesse of John Grisham. But unlike Grisham who has created many brilliant novels, it's ironic to see that Lescroart's end product ""The Vig"" could be so lame and B O R I N G. First of all, the characters are very hard to follow. Even the main plots are vague and perplexing. If you want real action, read Grisham and stay clear out of ""The Vig"". I am very dissapointed that somehow I bought this 'effortless' novel. Now only if I can find the reciept!"
2,Acapulco cliff -dragger,so-so pacing of a multi-sided police potboiler. recurring lescroart characters provide the glutinous structure for a plethora of stereotypic perps. elaborate (over 30 characters)to the point of becoming tedious.
5,"good, gritty mystery","The customers who panned this book obviously thought of John Lescroart as a legal thriller writer only. But before he put Dismas back into the courtroom, Lescroart's books were sort of Irish Elmore Leonard mysteries. That may be jarring for people, but come on, folks! Are you really so bound into formula that your brains can't switch gears and enjoy this?The Vig is a fine mystery with a complex plot, endearing characters, and great dialogue.Anyone who can call this a Grisham wannabe isn't thinking, and recommending a Ludlum wannabe like The Day After Tomorrow is CERTAINLY comparing apples to cinder blocks."
2,It's a shame Dismus survived that fall . . .,"I almost abandoned this book like three times. Was Dismus really a cop in other books? Because I'm a housewife in Ohio and I know better than to stand on the edge of a cliff with a bad guy. Dismus is the hapless victim of everything in the story, including his affair with a pregnant woman only four months widowed. I had the ending figured out well before halfway, a record for me and a sad indictment of the story. The only person I cared about in the whole book was the convicted felon -- another sad indictment. I should have bailed early, and given this mutt one star.I rate books as follows:***** Fun and meaningful book, or changed/challenged me in a positive way.****Really fun or meaningful; well worth the time.***Pleasantly skimmed the surface; not memorable.**Plodded through.*Abandoned; very flawed."
3,Rashomon it ain't,"I was unable to feel empathy for any of the characters due to the point-of-view shifts. But that's me, a guy who favors trad limited omniscience single character POV. If you like figuring out the plot via multiple views of the same action, you might like this book. It's not as skilfully done as Kurosawa's Rashomon, though!"
4,Good start to the series,"This is my first Dismas Hardy/Lescroart book and it offers a promising start to the Hardy series. There are a number of characters and intertwining stories throughout the novel. Cleverly written and laid out, with deep characters, this is not your typical ""whodunnit."" The plot is solid, though I can see where some reviewers hinted that there is almost too much going on in the book. I think, however, that this all likely lays the groundwork for the development of Hardy and others in the subsequent books. I'm looking forward to continuing with the series and seeing where Lescroart takes his characters."
3,the vig,"As always, I loved, the main characters. The plot, just did not, hold my attention. Not nearly as well done, as, THE MERCY RULE."
1,Disappointment,"The plot is a bit overly twisted and the rampant references to race, ethnicity, etc is beyond informative and leaning towards racist rather than i believe it's intended anti racist goal."
4,The Vig,"The book kept my intrest, while allowing me to solve (guess) the mystery ending prior to completing the book. The autor discribes the area where Dimas lives and works to a tee. I live in the communities that is discribed and enjoy imaging the scene of the crime and where the investigations take place."
4,I moved to San Francisco because of this author!,"It just so happens, that I am re-reading this book again, and am loving it even more now that I have lived in San Francisco for about 4 months. Dismas has suffered terrible losses- previous books- but is putting things back in order. All of his books are so well written, sometimes silly, sometimes heart wrenching. I would recommend this book- but do yourself a favor, start with his first book to really know Dismas Hardy."
4,The city by the bay.,"The Vig by John Lescroart is a solidly written San Francisco based murder mystery. Told in the third person, it has as its protagonist Dismas Hardy, cop turned lawyer turned saloonkeeper.The plot is complex enough to keep things interesting for the reader but at no time does it become overly convoluted. Moreover, The Vig contains many well fleshed out, believable characters, as well as several captivating subplots.Highly recommended."
3,A little disappointing....,"I've only read one other book by John Lescroart, Damage and it was a well conceived, written mystery. Vig was disappointing because there were too many characters and the story kept jumping back & forth between them and I found it difficult to follow at times. However, this will not dissuade me from reading another one of his books. My wife is currently reading Guilt and totally enjoying it and suggests I read it when she's done. I passed on Damage to her and she enjoyed his writing as much as I did and is why she chose to read another one of his mysteries. I have to look at his other books and decide which one I'll get next."
5,Captivating Right To The End,"THE VIG by John Lescroart is a Dismas Hardy series book. I have read all of this series and really enjoy the characters the author has created. Dismas owns a law firm; he use to be a street cop and prior to that, an army soldier. He's also half owner of a pub called the Shamrock with his brother-in-law.A former prosecutor informs Dismas that a guy they put away years ago, is now released. Shortly after, the prosecutor (Rusty Ingraham) is missing and a woman is found on his boat, dead. Dismas takes on the investigation and faces events from his past that could get him killed. This book is packed with suspense, mystery and action. I highly recommend it as well as the complete Hardy series."
4,Works fine,It turned out the device I purchased this for (WD My Book AV DVR Expander 1 TB USB 2.0/eSATA External Hard Drive) came with a cable but I'm glad I bought this one because it is longer.
3,"Works fine, plenty of length.","This eSATA cable works just fine connecting my computer to a 4-bay ProBox (ProBox 4 Bay Hard Drive Enclosure for 3.5-inch hard disk drive - USB 2.0 & eSATA). The price was right and it lets me keep the drive enclosure across the desk from the CPU which works better with how my desk is setup.My only complaint - and it's a MINOR one - is the plastic jacket of the cable is shiny and a little stiff. So it looks & feels a little cheap. It doesn't affect the performance at all, just pointing it out.I don't know if this cable is truly capable of reaching the speeds specified (though I cannot imagine why it wouldn't). I'm running it on an interface that's only capable of 1.5Gb/s speeds even though it's a SATA II interface (it's a PCIx 1x card)."
2,Cable Failed after 3 months,"I brought this cable to use with my desktop PC and external harddisk, after about 3 months it failedThe cable connection appeared loose - I'm not sure if this is specific to this cable or a design issues with eSata, but i'd expect the connector to lock into place. On several occasions this caused my PC to fail to boot due to the cable becoming loose. The transfer speed was good (when working)"
1,Did not work,"I bought it to connect my external hard drive to my Desktop, the cord did nothing, wouldn't let my Computer know there was a device there. Took it over to a local shop asked if they could check it fast they had the same result. I'm not too much of a complainer I bought this one for the price and saw it as not worth the effort to ask about returning it. Just be aware."
5,Superfast,"Makes good use of the esata port on the desktop as well as the hard drive.6 feet is a good length, slightly on the long side, but better to have some slack then just come up short, and makes it across my desk perfectly right now.Build quality is nice, feels durable, I think it would survive being run over by chair wheels easily, though I haven't tried that part, will update if I do.The connection to both the desktop and hard drive are snug, not loose/ do not feel it'll fall out."
2,not compatible with my hard drive,"it is not comapitble with ""Western Digital My Book AV DVR Expander 1 TB USB 2.0/eSATA External Hard Drive""at this link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MVZ60S/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlei dont know what the problem but it is not work not allow computer to identify the hard disk. may be the problem with the data transfer..i dont know whether this happened only with this product or not,,or only me !!"
5,"Good cable, Fast shipping","Great job guys!A new Seagate 320GB external drive was born!Awesome. Buy from these guys, you will NOT regret it."
4,Just what I needed,"If you just need an eSATA Cable, this is great to have. To be fair, it's the first one I've owned, but it works well and the length is great. It is stiff but that's how eSATA Cables are, and actually this one is fairly easy to work with as far as they go. Not to be confused with SATA."
2,Does not work,"I plugged this cable into 2 different external Hard Drives, on 3 seperate computers, but the computer never recognized my drive. The cable seemed loose fitting."
5,eSatisfaction!!!,Great cord for the money. It works like it should! Highly Recommended. I used it for transferring files between my computer and my external hard-drive without any problems. I love it.
5,High Quality Yet Flexible,"Usually you sacrifice flexibility for quality when dealing with eSATA cables, but not in this case. The cable is almost as flexible as an internal SATA cable - so there is no pulling or twisting as you would expect from a rigid eSATA cable connected to an external drive. I highly recommend this cable."
4,Maybe not for Tivo ???,"I bought this cable to go with my purchase of a Western Digital DVR Expander, connecting to Tivo. On talking with a tech help at WD. though i changed my mind and went with the cable supplied, placing the hard drive closer to the Tivo to accommodate. For best connectivity WD. did not recommend using a cable over 3 feet, which is why they supply that length, and not 6 feet, in the first place i suppose. Not being a tech guru I went with their advice and pass this along for prospective buyers to consider..."
2,"eSATA cable Works, low price","Wanted a longer cable than what's supplied with WD My DVR Expander to use with my DirecTv HR24-500;and this cable worked fine, and then 3 days later vibrated out of socket, wasn't in tight enough. I got refund"
1,Horrible quality and does NOT live up to expectations,"This Esata cable is faster than standard USB 2.0. However, the craftsmanship and durability is absolutely HORRIBLE. The two ends of the wire will rip and tear horribly with almost no strain at all. The initial transfer speed is good, but then the speeds drop to around 30 mbps after a few minutes. Poor quality cable, it WILL tear no matter what, and the transfer speeds are erratic. It's also ridiculosly overpriced, as the quality is so bad. Invest in a cable that doesn't rip and tear... this one will."
1,this dose not work,"I asked what cable I needed to hook my computer to my TV, and was told to by this one however this cable dose not fit in my usb port on my computer nore my TV, would send it back but it would cost me more then I paid, so this will go to goodwill."
5,Cube World,I discover it is fun game. It gives me enjoyment and gives me less stress. I like it lot. Thank you.
1,Never worked!,"I bought cube world for my daughter this holiday season, and the stick figures will NOT interact no matter what we do. We tried changing the batteries, cleaning the connections, restarting the cubes...nothing!!!! They are really boring without the interaction, and I can't get any info from the company on troubleshooting."
1,Doesnt work!,"One cube came working and the other does not. A complete waste of money. Not to mention that the cube that does work, really does not do much."
3,Great fun at first..,"Really fun, but kids (and me) get bored with them after a while. Now they are just shelf decorations for guests to play with (untill they get bored) I wish there were some more features or they were more interactive."
3,Kinda Cool,"I gave these to my brother for Christmas thinking that they were so cool. He says that they do not do everything that it says they will. They did not come with instructions so he has no idea if he is doing something wrong. He said when they do something it is pretty neat, but you have to watch them for a while. Very time consuming."
1,Too hard to squeeze,"The bottle is very hard to squeeze, and if you muster too much strength, the water will escape from under the cap. The info that came with the bottle claimed that the bottle gets easier to squeeze. After one full week in the woods, I give up. I can unpack my filter and pump a gallon of water in the time it takes to drink ten oz. of water from this thing."
4,"Great book, but not for beginners","A very worthy book full of great ideas and designs to decorate any dollhouse room, from nursery to bathrooms, parlors and cafes.Although this book is fantastically written and illustrated with pictures and patterns, it is quite a challenge to do some of the more advanced designs of the curtains.If you are a neofit, it could be frustrating to see that these constructing techniques are quite advanced, and except some of the more simple designs, you will have yourself troubled wondering how to begin, especially if you are not very good at sewing.I love Sue Heaser work, but I really find this book quite a challenge."
3,Be Careful,"They're not worth the price they're charging for them. When I bought them, they were $55. I'd say they're worth about $20. If you buy them, be careful putting them on...they're thin and can be easily dented!"
2,Size Matters,The quality of the finish is good. The shippment was fast and courteous. The rating is low because the size of the product's inside diameter is not equal to the american made stock wheels. They measure about 3/8th. of an inch smaller than stock Ford caps of the 40's and 50's.
5,perfect,"just the finishing touch we needed, sturdy construction and a perfect fit on '87 Chevy van stock rims"
5,Illustrated Book of Myths,My daughter received this book at about age 7 or 8. She loved it and read it many times. We let someone borrow it and it was never returned. I replaced it for my daughter who is now 17. She still loves the look. It's great for children or adults.
3,not very thrilling,"I am a Howard Duff fan, but I thought this movie was only fair, perhaps because of the time in which it was released. It only hinted at Howard`s sinister scheme (prostitution?). Howard is not depicted as the brute he was in East of Eden with Jane Seymour. A little tame by today`s standards."
4,"An old friend, rediscovered.","This album brings back so many memories of living in Beaufort, S.C. in the late seventies. It is laid back music played by two guitar legends. These guys are friends and it shows. They play with a warmth and skill that is rare in today's world. I spent many warm summer nights listening to these guys weave their magic. There is plenty of thumb-picking, speed-runs and off-key singing and just the right amount of intimate feeling. A gem of a recording by two old masters. Mistakes and all."
3,Great music but AWFUL MP3 compression by Amazon!!,"I have this EP on vinyl and am currently converting the songs to MP3. I thought I might save myself some effort by just buying them here. But when I listened to the samples, man are they bad! Super compressed...you can here the vocals squeezed and the weird ""flanger"" effect on the drums. I'm not anywhere near as much as an audiophile as I might come across, but I know BAD sound when I hear it. I'd rather spend some extra time making high quality MP3s from the original source versus spending cash on these poor quality files."
1,Crap,The led light flashes. I bought this for my neighbor who already owned an older version without led technology. She called me the other day because it what's flashing when she turned it on. I changed the battery's and it still does it.
1,Worst video I ever bought!,"Don't waste your money or time with this video...horrible, boring and pointless. If you're a guy and enjoy watching chicks who can't dance, then yes, it's worth the price. But other than that, the video is such poor quality and the people being interviewed are unbelievably boring. There is no actual footage of Kid Rock. Plain and simple, it's a total rip off!"
3,"I didn't know this band but, What a Band!!!","At this moment,I'm hearing this CD and I'm frightened. What live recording sound! What musicianship! What beautiful tunes! I'm still could not see them playing alive but I hope that they come to my country as fast as possible. I'm sure that everybody would like to see and hear them play their beautiful songs."
3,Healthy pop music with some local greek touches,"Although Pix Lax have repeated themselfs over and over all these years with their awfully similar albums , the greek music scene is lucky to have them . Greek pop music has been in deep crisis for over a decade so , in many ways this group has been a blessing .Pix Lax have a romantic lyric agenda and two good singers with melancholic charming voices . Listening to their music makes you happy for being a teenager. They talk mostly about lovelife troubles but that doesn't make them one-dimensional or boring . They also use various greek music instruments in their songs and that gives to their work an extra ethnical personallity . Non-greek persons should give this a try in order to discover a new fresh European pop sound . Greeks on the other hand should finally demand some kind of development from them or (if it's true that they have stopped working as a group) at least from their singers who now have gone solo ."
4,Beautiful,"Bought this as a gift to a wonderful friend. Jane Yolen is her favorite author and the fellow who did the illustrations in this book also illustrated a deck of tarot cards that this friend gifted me with.If you look hard enough, you may be able to find a signed copy like I did!!"
5,A Keepsake!,"This was one of my granddaughters first books. She loved this book and would walk around with it in her hands. She found great job in lifting up things to see what was under them, like the new puppies under the yellow cloth and to feel the wool of the sheep. This book has brought her hours upon hours of joy, and although she is 5 years old now, she will not part with it.Highly recommended.[...]"
4,Sinbad the Sailor,"the way his voice sounds in Sinbad the sailor is probably his best portrait. Bittersweet and not hallow, sencitive and not dramatic,tender but still the voice of a man. He was just like that. A sweet man, a friend for a life time, a man to fell in love with. A poet of life. Often indulging in various pleasures, such as cigarettes, deep feelings, still he take up painful adventures like, personal relations and songsHe was young when he died. His songs were left behind at the tip of the tongue, and in our hearts. This compilation covers all the kinds of songs he composed (folk, political, art and sensitive songs) and is more of a souvenir de coeur."
1,Scandalous Is Correct!!!!!!,"It was a scandal that I paid good money for this book. This is why people are so against urban fiction. I even read the whole book to give it a chance because that is only fair but come on now people. This book was garbage,the funny thing is it really had a good plot that just never materialized."
5,"Unspeakable Characters and Drama, Drama, Drama!","Scandalous is so far the best book that I have read this year and I read a lot of books. This is the authors first novel, but it is definitely a hit! I'm already in line for her second one whatever it may be. The characters in Scandalous are believable and so much like people that I know I was amazed. The erotica goes on and on and on and I was loving every page of it! I must admit when a friend of mine told me about this book and new author I was skeptical because I'm very picky when it comes to reading new unproven authors. But I went a head and took a chance and I must admit I was blown away! Literally! I wish I coud give it another star or two! Two-Thumbs Up for ReChella!!"
4,i liked it,"This book started it off kinda slow but i got into it eventually. It actually turned out pretty good the end was crazy. It was different from alot of books so every page was so unexpected and intresting. Basically it starts of with a Charles remarried after the death of his first wife. He cheated on her through out their whole marriage, Even when she was on her death bed he was sneaking off with women. Then remarried shortly after her death to the next fitting woman. Kept cheating and cheating until he finally got burnt and learned his lesson the hard way."
2,American bootlicking,"There is an obvious desire on the author's part to curry favor with American readers. Indeed he seems to spare no effort to be a toady, not only in his uncritical praises and optimistic assessment of the United States's prospects in the future, but also in his putting down all other rival powers to the US, real or imagined, now or in the future. As a guide to the ""big picture"" view of the twenty-first century, this approach strikes me as unrealistic and contrary to the fundamental patterns of world history. The simple fact is that great powers rise and fall, and to think that America in its exceptionalism is immune to this is just juvenile thinking. The world in the twenty-first century is a lot more complicated than Bill Emmott thinks."
2,A Book That Is Clearly Biased,"The author clearly supports America with a blind faith and is not qualified to write this kind of book with such a biased view. It also seems that he is hedging his predictions by adding too many caveats and what-if's, so much so that the final conclusions are weak. Nevertheless, I completed my reading of this book by treating it as a fictional storybook that helps me ease into bedtime."
2,A British View,"I'm not sure I can share Bill Emmott's skepticism about China. From the United States' point of view, the US-China relationship is going to be the most important bilateral relationship in the 21st century. Already in 2003 China has become America's third largest trade partner (after Canada and Mexico, and ahead of Japan) and America is China's second largest trade partner (after Japan and ahead of the EU). If the economic boom in China continues - a big if, but nonetheless a realistic one - then China will replace the United States as the largest economy within two decades. No wonder observers from Margaret Thatcher to Jack Welch to Henry Kissinger to Paul Wolfowitz are predicting China's rise to superpower status. Bill Emmott's opinions are unlikely to be widely shared here in the United States."
1,Corrections,"Actually, according to the World Trade Organization, China is now the world's fourth largest trade partner after the US, Germany and Japan - many times bigger than Holland. China is also on track to surpass Japan in total international trade volume within the next couple of years - maybe as early as next year. As for GDP in PPP, the CIA World Factbook places China in second place after the US at $6.5 trillion. The same publication places Thailand at #20, worth under $480 billion. There can be no doubt about China's growing economic clout. Bill Emmott's statistics were out of date the day the book was published; some of them were wrong even then."
1,"Chinese statistics ""dubious""?","In fact, since the late 1990's it was becoming clear to Western observers that the Chinese government has been understating its GDP. China's economic growth is now known to be higher than its official statistics claim. Anyone so out of touch with the latest developments shouldn't be the editor of the Economist."
1,food for fireplace,"David Hume said that if a book has neither facts nor figures, then ""commit it to flames"" because it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. This book is an excellent example."
2,Amateurish on China,"On China, Bill Emmott - and other readers - may do better to turn to the writings of Peter Nolan of Cambridge U, Nicholas Lardy of Yale and the U of Washington, Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley, Jim Rohwer of CSFB, Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, William Overholt of Harvard and RAND, and Gregory Chow of Princeton.All that Mr. Emmott can come up with on China is vague generalizations and amateurish gibberish. The rest of the book is more of the same."
1,Mr. Emmott is bearish on China,"I think Mr. Emmott is wrong to be bearish on China. Among those who are bullish on China are:Thomas Friedman, the thrice-winner of the Pulitzer Prize from the New York Times, whose book THE WORLD IS FLAT shows why China is succeeding.Jeffrey Sachs, the noted international economist, whose new book THE END OF POVERTY forecasts China to continue its incredible economic performannce well into the middle of the 21st century.Joseph Stiglitz, the former World Bank economist, Clinton's chief economic adviser and Nobel Laureate in Economics whose books have nothing but praise for China's economic management.Clyde Prestowitz, the former Reagan official, whose latest book predicts China will rule the world economy.Jack Welch, the former chairman of GE, whose new book WINNING tells Americans to expect further triumphs of the Chinese and how to benefit from them.Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, who never ceases to be impressed by China's economic performance."
1,Emmott claims China is peanuts in trade,"The latest figures from the World Trade Organization show the following (in total exports and imports of both goods and services):1. US - $2923.4 billion2. Germany - $1949.3 billion3. China - $1283.8 billion4. Japan - $1248 billion5. France - $1118.1 billion6. UK - $1101.6 billionIn addition, China's trade growth jumped 36% last year, compared to about 10% for the world as a whole (which figure includes China's).I don't know how any competent journalist can claim, as Emmott does, that China is peanuts in international trade, ranking behind the Netherlands (as he says in this book). The numbers show a very different picture. If any country is peanuts, it is Britain.Emmott's doubts that China's GDP growth is real must be put in the same perspective. Indeed, in the light of such robust trade figures, verified bilaterally by other countries and finally by the WTO, it is difficult to see how China's real GDP growth can be as low as he seems to think."
1,China,"China is the second most important country in the world, beyond any doubt. That, at any rate, is the view of most competent Western analysts, if the EU is excluded (as it should be for now). One day, sometime in the 21st century, China will become the most powerful and the most important country in the world, reclaiming its historical position. Calling China ""a modest country at best"" Bill Emmott is wrong about the China of today and even more wrong about the China of tomorrow. His ""20:21 vision"" is poor indeed."
1,Invidious comparison,"Nobody compared China to the United States...until Bill Emmott himself became the first one to make this suggestion. That China is not yet even remotely comparable to the US is obvious to everyone. What is not so obvious is why Bill Emmott calls China ""a modest country at best.""If comparisons are warranted, then perhaps China, the fastest rising power, should be contrasted with Britain and Russia, the fast declining ones - weak countries without a trace of modesty."
1,China,"China's share of merchandise exports and imports makes it the 4th largest trader in the world after the US, Germany, and Japan, according to the WTO, far far ahead of the Netherlands. Also, China's economy in purhasing power parity is $6 trillion in 2003 - the second largest in the world, and much much larger than Thailand's. (CIA World Factbook 2003) Bill Emmott's figures are way off the mark, and he also fails to cite his sources. It is unfortunate that the last reviewer swallows his statistics without thinking."
1,America the all-powerful,"Bill Emmott obviously tried to ingratiate himself with Americans as this book came out shortly after 9-11 and he wrote as though America is the only country that counts. This may have been true in 1945. By 2004, this is nonsense."
2,Trying a bit hard to be all things to all people,"A book this reader was looking forward to with anticipation, 20:21 vision turned out to be a bit of nothingness. The author doesn't really have much that is new to say rather it reads like a cobbling together of current economic and international relations points that you have probably contemplated yourself if you are at all interested in the field. For a complete layman, there are probably some interesting insights, and if you have been paying attention there are perhaps a few facts you haven't come across before. Yet ultimately, this book disappoints, especially considering that the author is also the editor of the excellent Economist. If anything, it might lead you to search out some more focused or specialized reading in the topic areas."
3,Good but dated,"This book is mainly about art and artists in the 1990s such as Julian Schnabel,Damien Hirst, etc. Those days are over and we're into a new era of art stars. Are they any better? Who's to judge, but they are different. Also the author of this book is British and so slants his perspective in that direction."
2,Not worth It,This book is just filler. There is not a lot of good information. All that's included is basic common sense. This is more for someone who has just made their first webpage. This is not for someome seriously interested in venturing out on their own.
1,"Amateur Book by an Amateur ""Designer""","I am a web design veteran and have decided to go out on my own to start a web design business. I thought this book might have some insight as to how to go about doing that.As I read the book, it was becoming clear that this book should be called ""Starting a Home Based Business For Dummies - with Some Web Stuff Thrown In""I got about halfway through the book and I was curious to see this guys work, so I - like other reviewers here - checked out his website.Yikes. It looks like a newbie's first attempt. All that was missing waas the blinking text and rotating logo. I put the book down after that. I can't take advice from someone I don't respect professionally. I wish I had more hands so I could give this book four thumbs down."
4,A great place to begin ......,"If you're thinking of starting a Web design business, then this book is a great place to begin. Smith covers all of the basics of starting a Web design business, including writing a business plan, buying equipment, establishing a legal structure, services you can offer, and making customer presentations.Additionally, he offers a few pointers that even some experienced designers might find useful, like ""charging by the site instead of by the page"" and a sample contract that can be explained to your customers. This is the type of information my small business Web designers might find useful.My only criticism is that it could be a little more detailed. For instance, the index is very shallow and there is not much actionable information that Web designers can use to promote their businesses. Lastly, I wasn't able to locate the URL for Smith's site (which may have been intentionally omitted by the publisher). My apologies if it's in the book."
2,"Informative, but please read with caution.","This book may point you in the right direction if you've never worked in the web design field. However, our of curiosity, I searched for author's ""business"" on the internet and found it.The ""design"" of his site is quite horrible and made me second guess anything published in this book.That being said, I'd like to warn you to use this book with discretion."
3,"Decent, but not great","I'm at the halfway point in this book. I'm finding that Smith's experiences parallel my own, which is pretty cool. Some of the topics are only lightly covered and could certainly be explained more, but books are like that.I will say, I have to agree with many comments here...If this guy's sites are making him a living, I should be a friggin' millionaire by now! His web sites are very amateurish and his design skills (which he seems to think are good (from the book) ) are minimal AT BEST. [...] Sorry Jim. Your book is decent but your sites are not."
4,Quite helpful,"This book is a great start for any beginner's. it covers some website stuff, as well as getting your name out there. It has some good ideas for getting started, and would be helpful to anyone looking into this business."
2,Perhaps I read too much in college : ),"This book didn't offer much info you don't already know, basic business 101. It's over-simplistic.The writter is not a very talented web designer,... All his designs look the same: basic & boring. All were acceptable 3-4 years ago (maybe) but not today! I'd get fired if I tired to pawn any of his sites off to my clients! Yet he's writting the book! - Go Figure. This is how he proved to me that if not anything else, he is a networking genius & in this catagory you will find some good points in the book."
2,"Outdated and very, very basic.","I read this book a few weeks ago and have to say, its age shows more than it should. After looking at it (3rd Edition - 2007) there are literally dozens of dated things that should've been updated, or at least removed before they ever published this again.While there may be some decent advice for the very beginner looking to get into web design, you can find all of this information in a many other books that the authors seem to actually care about and update as time passes.There are a few good points with management and accounting in the book, but other than that if you have the basic knowledge most people do today in the design world this book is going to be too dumbed down for you."
2,A picture says a thousand words -- a web site in this case,The book is as good as the author's web site. Check it out at blarneystone dotcom.
1,Word of caution,"The 2nd edition of this book is terrible. Look it up and see what other people have said about it. Be sure you can flip through this edition before buying it. Also, look at the author's website and prepare for the shock of your life (he writes a book about a subject he knows next to nothing about)."
2,"Good, but not detailed enough!","This book was a excellent resource on starting a small business. However, the book lacked much needed technical information concerning web design. The web design chapters needed to be more specific and detailed."
2,Home based web design business!,"This book is awsome. ""How to Start a Home-Based Web Design Buiness"" has helped me set up my home based business web design business. It covers all the essentials and will get you on the right path quickly. I've read this book few months ago and I've developed a business website at www.procreative.ca. I suggest you make this your first step towards starting a web design business. The next step is obviously picking out a good development language for database driven websites. ColdFusion is easy to learn, but it costs money. On the other hand PHP is a little bit more difficult - but its free."
5,A must have for the new Web design business!,"This book was just what I was looking for. I was surprised to find so few books on the subject of starting a home-based web design business and was thrilled to come across this one. The author, Jim Smith explains such things as What services to offer your clients, design, hosting etc., attracting customers, accounting and record keeping. This is not a book on learning HTML but does offer a few tips on the subject. If you're planning on starting a home-based Web design business this book is an excellent place to start."
3,"Average, but Useful Info.","I bought this book in spite of some of the bad reviews on it and I thought it was full of good insight on the web design business. I definitely thought it was just an average book though and the author's personal web design business' web site is quite mediocre, but the book does shed some light on the business and I found it quite helpful, and its a great reference to open up again later."
4,heart-breakinly funny,"This is the third installment of the Hunsenmeier sisters, starting with Six of One and Bingo. Six of One will always be my favorite, but this is a remarkable follow-up. This book focuses on the years around World War II, and Juts adopting a child. Funny stuff, motherhood is who raises the child, not who gives birth. Rita Mae Brown always writes with the bittersweet style, reminiscent of Charles Dickens. I recommend this series of books highly."
1,Disappointing Rehash,"Six of One is superior to Loose Lips. I'd recommend (re-)reading that instead. The characters are more fully drawn, the wit is sharper, and the story is just plain better."
1,Loose Lips,"If this were the first Rita Mae Brown book I ever read it would be the last. The main characters are not eccentric but charming. They are just plain mean and selfish. There is nothing humorous about touching a child with the burning end of a cigarette or repeatedly calling her a brat. Not well played, Ms. Brown. You are better than this."
3,A Prequel,"If you have read Six of One and Bingo, you should know that this book preceeds those in the lives of the characters. It was a little confusing until I figured that out. I am a big Rita Mae Brown fan, but this story could have been tightened up."
5,The Truth about Iraq,"This book is very well written, by a highly respected author and former Bush administration official, who has been in Iraq and witnessed the fiasco firsthand.Highly recommended."
1,A Literary Fiasco,"This is a thoroughly dishonest book written by a man who has never been in Iraq during the reconstruction he condemns -- and has never been in Baghdad at any time. This is propaganda, a polemic, but not history. Mr. Phillip's venomous attack on Bush, Bremer, et al, is mere vituperation without any sound basis in fact or experience. Mr. Phillips should be ashamed of himself -- but as long as the money rolls in, why would he?"
5,Cute Ornament,Very cute ornament. Real feathers on the hens and they have whimsical arrangemt. Ornament is a little larger but light enough to hang on the tree.
5,Perfect fit,While troubleshooting my Flushmate tank I broke this part. Received this part and is an exact replacement part that fits perfectly. Toilet is flushing like new now. I would recommend this to any one who has a flushmate tank.
5,Fixed my issue in a hurry,"Great price, simple installation and it stopped my leak. Who can ask for more? OEM quality can't be beat. Installs in about 2 minutes, just flush the toilet a few times after installation to prime the tank and you're all set."
2,Not that interesting,"Dani Myers is a ""communications specialist,"" which means she helps people break up with their significant other. She works for Your Big Break, Inc., which is not a believable company. I was irritated with the fact that most people who break up will not hire a company to do the breaking up for them. That is just tacky and weird. And building a Breakup Recovery Kit? That came off as absurd to me.One potential client happens to be a woman who is trying to break up with her boyfriend, who happens to be Dani's dad. Half of the book centers around this plot, how Dani and her brother Sean handle the changing family dynamics and how it affects Dani. The other half is what happens when Dani disobeys company rule #5: do not get personally involved. This subplot I found amusing and interesting.Overall, it is a quick read and is predictable, but it wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped for."
2,Flat and Disappointing,"I read and enjoyed the author's first book and looked forward to this one. I tried to like it, but was disappointed. The plot concept seemed original, but the book itself just seemed flat, no pun intended, and devoid of any real charm. The characters weren't particularly appealing and though I finished the book, it was a bit of a struggle. But, hey, maybe it's me :) Sometimes when you have high expectations, you're set up for a let-down. Wish I could recommend this book, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I'd expected."
3,Good but not as good as first book...,"I really loved her first book but this one just wasn't as good. I found that the scenes were really short and I wasn't really that excited or interested to see what would happen next. Although an enjoyable read, I just felt that for me it was only about 3 stars."
4,"Fun, an easy beach read","Your Big Break is a great, quick read. I read it in one afternoon at the pool. While it doesn't have the greatest writing it is engaging and entertaining. I would def. read another book Edwards afet reading this one."
5,"Great, funny quick read","I got to read the first 3 chapters of this book online as part of a Bzz Blast (as I am a Bzz Agent)and as soon as I was done with those chapters I had to rush out and find this book. I was so happy that I was able to find it right away. I read the entire book yesterday! It has been a long time since I have not been able to put a book down and I just have to finish it then. This book is so funny that I was literally laughing outloud on numerous occations (which made my husband think I was nuts!). It deals with a woman named Danielle Myers and she works for a company that will help you break up with people. Danielle's life gets complicated when a woman comes in her office to have her break up with her married boyfriend, who turns out to be Danielle's father. Her life is further complicated as she begins to fall for one of the men that she was hired to dump. I would very highly recommend this book to anyone! Very very funny!"
4,A great snapshot in time,"Brian Epstein, by writing this book in the middle of the Beatles phenomenon, provides us with a great snapshot in time - a time unlike any other before or perhaps since. Without being conceited (in fact, he reveals in his own words many of his own faults) he provides a fascinating insight into what was probably one of the great judges of pop music talent of the last 30 years. Reading this now, knowing how Brian's life was to turn out, leads one to wonder just what might have been. His style of writing, more conversational and ""simpler"" than one might have gathered from his outward appearance, makes this an easy and entertaining read and a must for Beatle fans."
3,a big piece of the Beatles puzzle,"This book by the Beatles' manager is somewhat boring and rambling, but sprinkled with great tidbits of insight into what the Fab Four were really like in the chapter called, ""Them."" The book is filled with shameless self-promotion and feigned modesty, and yet Epstein manages to come off as likable and gentlemanly. It is apparent that he cared a great deal for the Beatles as well as the other bands he managed. It is a shame that he died so young, and one can't help but wonder if Beatles' history would have been greatly altered if the man who promoted them to fame hadn't passed all too soon."
5,Good CD for an overview of Bible,This is a wonderful CD on the bible through the ages. A timeline approach with humor and wonderful old/current places shown to understand how the scriptures were put together. And more important- How it relates to you now.Used it with a large group of adults and 6th graders in a religous class. Both got the messages and it held their interest. Defenitely one you can use with teens and adults. Beautiful pictuers.
4,Great Video - Incomplete on Amazon Instant Video,"Time Travel Through The Bible is a great series that introduces some of the Bibles history in great detail. As a fan of Star Trek it was nice to see Jonathan Frakes as the narrator and he does a great job overall. Unfortunately on Amazon Instant Video the film is cut short to only 48 mins when the DVD states is 107 mins total. This seems to be a part 1 of 2 but the rest of the series is not on Amazon Instant Video. I am going to have to purchase the DVD to watch the rest of the series, for this part ends at the birth of Jesus. I highly recommend this series for young adults as well as adults to learn more about the history of the Bible."
4,"I laughed, I cried, I bowed in solemn reverence.","Good production values, but I felt the part where Jesus gets assimilated by the Borg collective to be somewhat speculative."
5,The best book I have ever read and the one I nver forgot,"Witch Week is the book I loved and never forgot. Now that I am a mother, I have been trying to remember a lot of books I read from libraries and buy them for my child, but this one I never ever forgot. I used to buy it for kids on birthdays until it was time to read it to my own daughter. I read it again and had the same incredible sensation of floating as I did the first time. This was amazing, how can you feel entranced reading a book in the same way as when you were twelve? So I read it to her, she read it to me, I read it, she read it, then when we were done, we rented a CD and listened to it, just as hooked. When the CD was done, I wanted to go right back to the beginning, and start over, just to keep that magical feeling going, forever. Diana, I love you! I've reread other books by her, and they are all good so far, but Witch Week is still my favorite!"
5,Better than Harry Potter!!,This book is second only to the Magicians of Caprona also by Diana Wynne Jones. The book is an awasome journey of childrens discovery of themselves and their place in the world. Better than than the Harry Potter series by a long shot!!!
5,Witch Week by Diana Wynne Jones ...,"A note that had written by someone warns ""Someone in this class is a witch."" A boy named Charles discovers that he could cast spells and he do cast spells on people. ""Simon says"" spell. Whatever Simon does became true. A girl named Nan Pilgrim who's ancestor is a famous witch of all Dulcinea Wilkes becomes a witch too. She discovers that she could ride brooms and suddenly describes things with magic. This book is an enthusiastic book with lots of astonishing characters such as Brian Wentworth, Charles Morgan, Nan Pilgrim (Dulcinea Pilgrim), Nirupam, Estelle etc. If you hadn't read this book yet, you should try this book!!The book has a mysteries of witches and witchcraft all across the book. ..."
3,Harry Potter fans - You ain't seen nothin' yet!,"I'm as much of a Harry Potter fan as the next girl, but this story really takes the cake for a good book. It's fun for kids of all ages, and it'll have you cracking your ribs with laughter. In one of the many worlds parallel to our own, witches are as common as freckles, yet witchcraft is a crime punishable by death. So when one student of class 6-B anonymously slips a note to the teacher that says one student in the class is a witch, it is a very serious matter in deed. All the characters have real depth and are perfectly believable. Lowood school is just horrible enough to be real. And, most importantly, THIS BOOK IS HILARIOUS!!!"
4,Witch Week,"This book is very intresting and imaginative. It is about another universe where in the modern day, witches are still burned and is set at a boarding school called Larwood House where a lot of the children are 'witch-orphans'. It has an unusual plot and is a good read, but one thing which spoiled it for me is I didn't really like or identify with any of the characters. Charles Morgan was probably my favourite character. Lots of other people who have reviewed this have compared it with Harry Potter, I read this book before I read Harry Potter and don't think they are much alike at all. I prefer Harry Potter, however but I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy stories about magic, and other Harry Potter fans would probably enjoy it."
5,very accessible,"I enjoy a lot the work of Rodney Yee, this disc is just right for me, not exhaustive but yet challenging. It gives a nice perk up if done in the morning. Beware that the whole routine takes only about 20 minutes."
4,Ditto earlier reviews,"Positives:Works on your upper body--a lot!Laid-back voice-over narrationBeautiful settingRapid flow almost moves into a cardio workout for short periodsChallenging enough to give me goals to work towardNegatives:Voice-over narration is behind on-screen poses much of the timeDifficult poses, particularly for a ""beginner"" DVDOverall, this is a good DVD to use as a variation from other yoga practices, but I don't think I'd want to use it daily because of the level of difficulty for me and the voice-over problems."
1,doesn't flow,"This workout doesn't flow and is a very boring workout. The half hour feels like 2 hours. Bryan Kest gives a better more intense workout with great flow leaving you feel refreshed as well as having worked muscles and the 50 minutes goes in no time. Or try ""quickfix power yoga"" if you want a 30 minute power yoga workout when short on time."
4,"A good stress-reduction, physical experience","You really can't go wrong with Rodney Yee. But he does lack the attention to the viewer and practitioner you'll get from Bryan Kest, for example. He doesn't talk to you or about your feelings and the poses are too quick in some places to do much good. A pose should be held about 12 seconds at least. You're in up dog about one to two seconds and must revert to down dog.Nonetheless, you get a good general physical workout and feel tenseness fade. So this short yoga session serves it's purpose.Recommended.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
4,power yoga,"I love this CD tho there is still much I have trouble with. I am starting to feel stronger and my back is becoming more flexible and stronger, as well as my abs.While this CD is above beginner level, it challenges you to go beyond. I practice every day and I already see differences in my weight, flexibility, strength, balance, and I am no longer in constant back pain."
2,Not for beginners....period.,"This workout is for people who know the poses already,do not need any instructions and can move from each one with flexibility and speed. I am not one of these people right now in my Yoga practice. For example,as I was attempting to get into one of the poses he had already moved through it and was already on another pose.I am still in the process of learning to breath along with the poses as is emphasised in any Yoga practice. Apparently not in his Power Yoga series.It felt as if I was doing an aerobics workout. Not even Rodney's calming voice saved this DVD for me.I will be putting this one on my shelf until I am at a higher level of Yoga."
1,Inconsistent and frustrating,"Although I can do most of the poses in this and am suitably challenged by the few I can't (or can't do well), I find this DVD to be, overall, not worth it. Yee is inconsistent both in instruction and in pacing.Instruction: Sometime he doesn't tell you to exhale or what to do while you're exhaling -- he'll skip over a pose. (You go from inhale back bend to inhale namaste hands, but he didn't tell you that you were supposed to do mountain pose on the exhale. One might say you could get it from watching, but when you're in a back bend, you can't see your television.)Pacing: If you follow him properly, your breathing cycle can go from inhale and exhale in the same second to inhaling over three or four seconds. I understand that this may be intentional, but he doesn't really give you anyway to gauge which it's going to be until you're in the middle of it."
1,Horrible,"Don't read this book. Although you think it's going to be an intriguing mystery set in the African-American entertainment industry, it's really a clever ruse for two out-of-touch authors to create one of the most boring, slow-moving novels I've ever read. Don't worry about taking a sedative; just read this rubbish."
3,Fun mystery to try to solve,"The book started off strongly, with the introduction of possible suspects, and the murder of others. If you like who-done-it books, you may find this book interesting. However, towards the middle and end of the book, everything feels rushed, as if trying to fit all the information into a set number of pages. Character development declines, and characters you may have been interested in are eliminated. Trying to figure out the who did it and why, and how each character is interconnected to be solved as a contest is an intriguing idea, and it's a great gimmick for book sales. On the downside, the book is useless unless you eventually know what the real answer was and what the winner wrote. With enough searching, you can find out who won, but 2 years later, I still haven't found the correct answer (this requires you to have written for the request before the deadline). If anyone found the correct answer, please let the rest of us know."
2,So..Who Killed Tiffany Jones?,"Does anybody have the answer, i know the contest is over by now. I was not pleased with this book at all."
2,Good insights marred by poor writing and repetitive details.,"Dunlap comes across loud and clear in his prescription for ailing companies. His general four point approach is useful, but the text is filled with contradicting advice and repetition of the same advice and details, ad nauseam, say nothing of several typos. Dunlap does not seem to be a very open minded individual, and his single-faceted approach to companies comes across as over-simplified and shallow. This book would be great if it had a more demanding editor and was 100 pages shorter."
1,Self-Promotional from a Crook,"Al Dunlap should not be profiting from books. The man is an out and out criminal. As CEO of Sunbeam he ran accounting scams to hide gargantuan losses from investors. Whereas the ""common man"" is thrown in jail for urinating on the sidewalk (a crime with little ripple effect), Dunlap and his ilk (the legalized criminals that run Wall Street and Corporate America) walked away with a slap on the wrist. He was forced to pay a measly $500,000 sum and walked away with $99.5 million bilked from investors. Dunlap is merely another Madoff, running a sophisticated Ponzi-scheme to transfer wealth from the common herd to the upper 1 percent. The book is a self-promotional piece of tripe written by a psychopathic megalomaniac that will go down in the dustbin of history as just another scumbag, white collar criminal."
1,"Easy-to-read, but not very interesting","This book was very difficult to stay interested in. The theme of doing away with waste and perks is apparent quickly. Soon after, I tired of the author's unending self promotion. Given the ""accounting irregularities"" and stock plunge at Sunbeam during the author's term as CEO, it makes me wonder whether the teacher believes his own lessons."
1,This is the mentality that has destroyed our economy,"It is good reading because it helps you to see why millions of jobs have either been eliminated or sent out the country, who our economy is in a shambles. It is the hateful greedy sadistic mindset of people like Mr Dunlap that has been embraced by enough CEOs to do the damage we are all suffering through now. Employees are expendable machine parts who should be changed like light bulbs, the dollar is everything. I think people should read this book, to see what an evil satanic beast Mr Dunlap is. It might help you to understand what is happening now."
4,Will we have a second part regarding the failure at Sunbeam?,"Unfortunately I read it after Al had been dismissed by Sunbeam, so it makes me think that he's methods are good if you intend to sell the company (maybe Wayne Huitzenga read the book and is following his advice and applying it to the Florida Marlins). It is very easy to read because it's a written in a very narrative style and even if you are only reading it you get carried away by this man's energy. I hope we can get a second part telling us what happen in Sunbeam after his initial success."
4,Huge Ego,"Clearly Al Dunlap has a massive sized ego he states that ""he"" fixes all the companies himself with a few others so in that respect it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. None the less during tough economic times or any time really the book does offer some good strategies and ideas to remain profitable, In the business I manage we were able to decrease labour by 30K, decrease assets by 100K and increase profits by 9% despite falling revenue of 18%. So take on board the lessons and your company may survive."
1,Give it a miss,"Self-serving, self promotional pulp fiction. It should have its name changed to ""My Resume"".For a more balanced view read ""Chainsaw"" by John A Byrne."
1,Amazed this is still in print...,"Dunlap (or his ghostwriter) may state some good, no-nonsense business ideas here. But given Dunlap's disastrous stint at the helm of Sunbeam, and more recently being the focus of shareholder lawsuits and SEC investigations, it's impossible for any informed, intelligent person to take this book seriously. According to ""Chainsaw,"" John Byrne's expose of Dunlap and the Sunbeam fiasco, Dunlap violated virtually every tenet of ""Mean Business."" It's one thing to be a tough leader, but Dunlap crossed the line into sheer sadism and cruelty... all driven by personal greed.There are plenty of better corporate role models out there, and plenty of better business books. In fact, I can't imagine why ""Mean Business"" is still in print other than as an historical curiosity..."
2,The Notorious Career of Al Dunlap in the Era of Profit-At-Any-Price,"Al Dunlap -- a.k.a. ""Chainsaw Al"" -- was ruthless in downsizing corporations for short-term shareholder profit. While reviled on Main Street, Dunlap was loved on Wall Street for bringing huge returns to investors and shareholders ... until the dark side of his actions began to emerge."
5,Another fun video from the Scorpions!,"Nothing less than excellent perfomances by this hot rockin' German band! The Leningrad show really rocks! It is very apparent that the crowd is feeling the music. The kids that bring the tulips are really awestruck to meet Klaus, especially when Klaus gives the one boy a pair of leather pants that he had worn several times in concert. I thought it was cool of the band to hang with their fans in the cities and go to house parties and jam with the local bands. Wish they would do something like that on their tours here in the US. Klaus even helps a local record store replenish their stock with the real deal. The Russian band Gorky Park rocks out with the Scorps and there was a cool all-girl punk band that performed. I also enjoyed the alternative fashion show, the beautiful Russian architecture, and the Russian folk song."
2,"Doesn't work on 15"" PowerBook G4 1.5 GHz","Apparently, the PowerBook G4 1.5 GHz laptops provide only 0.5 amps of current on the USB port which is what the USB spec calls for. However, some hard drives draw slightly more than this which means they don't work! This drive just clicks when plugged into my PowerBook - never spins up or mounts. Doh.It did work okay on a friend's iBook I tested it with, and on a G4 desktop computer.Also, the case construction is flimsy plastic - easy to bend it in with your fingers. Didn't make me comfortable that my data would be safe.Not recommended. Try the LaCie ones instead."
2,Great portable drive but unreliable,"I worked great for me until I wanted to copy a 10GB file from my laptop's hdd to this portable drive. It always hanged my OS whenver I tried. I plugged the drive into the other PC and tested it with another large file and it did the same thing, freezing my PC. Certainly, the drive was formatted with NTFS to support files over 4GBs. I ran WD diagnostic tools and it reported OK."
3,"Slick, Solid, Stable","I just got the WD Passport 120 GB. First impressions are excellent. Small, lightweight, cute. There are two points that you need to consider and these are omitted on purpose from WD website.1. The USB connection. If you have a laptop there is a chance that the USB may be underpowered and the hard drive will not work. you need power supply in this case or get a powered USB host ( 20 bucks more ). My machine is TOSHIBA Satellite A10, pretty old, but I have no problems with the USB. So this is really a minor issue. Plus you can always return the drive and get powered one.2. A bit disappointing is the fact that the drive is only 111 GB. Yeah, yeah I was duped as probably many others. In reallity you will have 111 GB because of some formatting bamboozle."
3,"works as advertised, but not with a notebook computer...","Worked create plugged into my work desktop computer, but needed the power adaptor for use on my notebook computer. Too bad. It's common knowledge that external drives advertised to work without a power adaptor end up not working with notebooks. It stated on the box that it may not work with ""some"" computers. Really it should say: power adaptor required for most notebooks.Otherwise, this is stylish, small drive I was looking forward to using. But had to return it--I've got enough extra cables in my life as it is without having to shell out ten more dollars to Western Digital."
4,A crucial book in the field of software engineering,"This book is crucial to a thorough understanding of software engineering principles. Watts Humphrey is one of the most important forces in the field, and this book is vital to anyone wishing to understand the intricacies of managing a large software development project. Be aware that this book is not easy reading. I would only recommend it for academics, or for the serious practitioner."
4,"Very good, highly detailed, very dry.","I found the book to be very useful and highly pertinent for managing software projects. It starts with guidance on how to evaluate your current process, and then evolves from there. Overall, a very good book. My only reason for giving it four stars is that it is *so* dry, it is extremely slow reading. A great reference, though."
1,Devoid of sense,"It's amazing that Humphrey can be so popular, given his ineptitude at forming coherent arguments for his positions.This book is filled with unjustified, unreasoned dogma. For example, he argues that the reason for an SQA organization is that software quality is a good thing. This is a non-sequitor; the point he should have been arguing for is WHY an SQA organization improves software quality.Read this book--for an example of a modern miracle cure peddler. Or, read it to see how gullible some software engineering managers can be. But don't expect it to help you improve your product."
1,Incomplete!,I wish I did not buy this book! Very few examples that have nothing to do with the real SAT's.
3,"Quite a nice single but the whole thing is ""SAME""","This CD is pretty good but the mixes are not too good. I mean i liked the first track which is the normal version but the 2nd and the 3rd track are almost the same and are the extended mix of the song the only difference being that there are vocals on the 2nd track and the 3rd one is instrumental and a little bit of difference here and there. But ATB is quite a DJ so you should have this!! And the 4th number is not really good because its a slow version of the song...real slow versionHis album ""Movin' Melodies"" is amazing and his single ""fields of love""........highly recemmonded!"
5,Deirdre Shannon Voice of an Angel,"This is one of the best cds I own (I own over 1500)! Deirdre songs range from light and witty to the hauntingly beautiful rendition of ""The Prayer"". The Prayer is a duet with Matthew Gilsenan of the Celtic Tenors (and Deirdre's brother). There is a lot to be said about family harmony vs harmonizing with non family members. While the later can be somewhat excellent as with say the Celtic Tenors and Celtic Woman, one can be more relaxed and the flow of music spills forth and weaves a picture in ones mind that pulls you in and surrounds you as if you were sitting in the concert hall with them. When listening to any of the afore mentioned artist you know you have been serenades by angels! Why this is not yet available via amazon. com is beyond me."
5,Solid and refreshing...all sides should read,"A commentary that either gets 5 stars or 1 star is probably worth the read. If Dr. Efird did not do a good job poking holes in the Darbyist theology, folks wouldn't spend so much space expressing their anger. If all you want is a book showing you how to find codes in Revelation pointing out exactly when the Second Coming will take place, you will be disappointed by this book. It provides a serious and scholarly look at Revelation and apocalyptic lit of John's time, and it is fascinating. It will be a challenge to folks who are a big fan of the theology at the foundation of the Left Behind series. But it is fair, and Dr. Efird uses a faithful approach to scripture to counter some of the more common understandings that many have picked up from that series. Some folks get angry when their beliefs are challenged with scripture and well-reasoned exegesis. But if you want a better understanding of the book of Revelation, this is a great choice."
1,A prime example of how easy it is to mislead others....,"If the authors had bothered to do any actual research they would have found out the real reason for the existence of this dubiously titled organization, a political pry bar would be good way of describing it.Unfortunately the writers chose a side rather than looking at it objectively, which, of course is the whole modus operandi of this branch of the Brady organization. I did not read anywhere that explained how they are funded in large part by George Soros, the maniacal billionaire whose sole intention is to bring down the current government, probably just an oversight though.The one thing this book does prove however is just how easy it is for people to be duped so I guess in light of that it deserves one star."
1,Propagandist hype by a gun-grabber...,"Want to support those who would take away your rights (and not just the 2nd Amendment guaranteed rights - these people are engaged in an effort to stifle the voices of the nearly 5 million people in the NRA, not to mention the countless others in all of the other pro-2nd Amendement organizations)?? Then buy this book.Or don't, and help to put a socialist out of work.Looks like a million is a lot less than it used to be.Billing itself as the ""Second Million Mom March"", the event in DC this past week drew about 2000 people.Hell, by that logic, there's about 500 people people here in my office, and I'm all alone.And hey - folks - when you have Jesse Jackson as your keynote speaker, that tells you quite a bit about the target audience."
1,Feel-good unreality,"Maybe the book should be subtitled, ""How an elite few can try to impose their will upon others.""The ""Million"" moms, alleged to be a grassroots movement, but actually funded by a millionaire, never actually reached a million members.Famous ""million"" moms like Rosie O'Donnell call for the banning of all handguns, but Rosie herself has employed an armed bodyguard to protect her child!This kind of elitism is closer to the reality than the humble, grass-roots ""story"" told by this book."
1,But he can't sing!,"When Audra McDonald covers your songs, you've made the big time! This guy is a good song writer (but if Audra sings it, it's bound to be good). The problem with this CD is that Mr. Lipton can't sing. Too bad (for me. I spend $25.00 on his pair of CDs.)"
5,Mmm... Delightful. Like great chocolate!,"So okay... Not all movies can hit you between the eyes. But you also want to be able to enjoy a different type of movie. One that's mellow, that's subtle, that lies on your tongue and slowly melts... One of those movies is this one. Subtle. Delightful. Funny. Just like great chocolate!"
2,not too bad,this is one of htose movies... you can watch it.. but it doens't mean much.. Laura Flynn Boyle plays a barmaid married to a former ball player. While she stays with a hispanic artist named jesse (ironic.. cuz i know soem one liek that too)whom she falls in love with while she left her hubby cuz hes keeping all of their disability money... basically a story of how laura and another con man help get the money that he owes her..
5,Markos,"The compilation contains many of the great songs by Markos Vamvakaris but it is important to remember that the songs are late 1950's - early 1960's remakes of many of his older songs.As a result you will not be getting the original recordings. However, the remakes cemented these songs as standards of Greek music and are truly inspiring interretations. All in all simply wonderful. These artists modernized some very old songs and made them true standards."
3,Be careful!,"I had two problems. When the box arrived, it was smashed and I was missing one of the legs. Fortunately, I received good service and they sent me another leg free of charge. The other issue is that both chairs broke within one week of each other. At first, I thought it was because of misuse, but I was sitting in the other chair, turned around to get up and the back completely separated!! Apparently the sockets for the screws between the seat and the back aren't secure. Be careful!! So, now we have tape (a lot) around the legs to keep them from breaking again..."
4,Cute Bistro Setting,"Overall very cute table and chairs. Time consuming to assemble and tightening the screws was not simple. The table and chairs are very sturdy, but the wood surface scratches easily."
4,Satisfied,"The table and chairs are perfect. There was a nick on the table, but easily covered with a stain pen."
5,table,Perfect fit for my kitchen. Came to me in perfect condition and easy to put together. Very sturdy.
4,Very pleased with this set,"This is just the perfect size for my small area. It really is meant for two people only. I'm glad I read the reviews though before purchasing it. You really do need a drill to assemble the parts together. It's easy to put them together. I just didn't realize in the beginning that the little gadget they included together with the screws is what you need to use to tighten the screws for the legs of the table (the circular thing that's seen in the middle on the photo). Otherwise, it's all good with this product. Seats are comfy and it's the right size for small spaces."
2,waiting on replacement parts,"The item I received was obviously returned by someone else. It was damaged and the hardware was scattered throughout the box. After talking to the customer service area, they paid the postage to return the damaged parts and are in the process of replacing them. This has taken a long time, but the company has been great to work with. The set seems to suit my needs. It is far from heavy duty, but is a nice set for a small space. The wood on the top of the table and chairs is somewhat soft, so I plan to give it a few coats of poly for a little extra protection. I am pretty happy with the frame. I think it will work out nicely."
5,3pc Bistrol dining table,"We find this to be an excellent small dining set, especially for the price. We've seen similar sets for twice the price. It's attractive and sturdy, seats 2 people nicely and can even be used for 4 people to have a small lunch. The materials are high quality and it was easy to assemble, though it was helpful to have 2 people working together. It's a great choice for a small dining area in a condo or apartment."
1,untroubled,"verse by this critic is unpretentious, i.e. without appropriate ambition, teetering on trivial....more dance than song"
2,Teenage ennui,"Before reading this I had high expectations of it. After reading it, mostly in between classes, I'm sadly disappointed. If you're a fan of Lau's poetry you may gain some insight into them through this journal.Honest? Yes. Brutally frank? I don't think so. Like others have said: rather than an account of struggle and hardship, all we have here is a bored teenager who did a 2-year stint as a street worker.I also question her reason for running away. Sure, overbearing ethnic parents can be stifling and problematic when you've grown up in a western world with (somewhat) different values and ideals to those of your parents. Fair enough, they locked her in her room most of the time and forced her to study; but is that really that bad? It wasn't like they were feeding her a diet consisting of only two-minute noodles and only letting her out to have showers."
1,Failed to strike me....,"This book is similar to the classic 'Go Ask Alice', but it fails to deliver the same freshness and universality of its predecessor. 'Runaway: diary of a street kid' is a tirade of emotions, with little originality or a real subject."
3,"been through hell and back, have we?","I must say, i do wonder if her editors had a hand in this book. I was drawn into it, I admit, and she has a way with words most people would only like to have, but there's something really disquieting about the book. Some seems show offish and that's when you wonder how much the original text has been altered by herself or editors. It's interesting to read but you also realize how many people she depended on (used?). But she's pretty insightful, nonetheless."
3,yawn...snooze,"Ok I tried 3 times to read this book but ended up totally bored with it(this is rare). I work with many kids on the street, their stories are more intersting for book form. I admit Lau is a good writer.....but it really lacked something..... maybe the pull to stop me from yawning!"
1,Poor Me. I'm A Victim And It Is Everybody Else's Fault!,"This is a very tiresome and tedious book about a girl named Evelyn who ran away from home at the age of 14 because her mother yelled a lot and her father was out of work most of the time. Sadly there are millions of young people in this same situation but they don't exchange an unhappy home life for the mean, homeless streets.The author devotes page after page of an endless and futile merry-go- round of prostitution and then seeking solace through drugs. She ""hooks"" up with this lowlife loser named Larry who she thinks is a ""nice guy"" because he readily supplies her with Valium, Alcohol,Mandrax, Methadone and LSD.Evelyn tries valiantly to live up to her self created image of a tortured artist because of her scribblings in her journal but all we are left with is 276 pages of 'Poor Me"" and self inflicted suffering and self pity."
1,"Uninspired, drab, and lusterless...","...is how I'd describe ""Runaway."" A collection of diary/journal entries, the book highlights and ups and downs (a lot of downs and very few ups) of the author's life as a street kid. Oh, and it's also supposed to pass off as a ""...compelling and unsettling journey into the mind of a teenage girl."" (as written by the Globe and Mail.) Hardly. This drivel is essentially 300 odd pages of self pity, regrets, and whines. The suffering experienced by the author was self inflicted and that warrants no pity whatsoever. The book absolutely terrible. Go borrow it from your local library and refrain from purchasing it. Even then I would advise against picking the thing up.If you want to read about true human suffering, misery, and hardship, do yourself a favour a pick up ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" The horrors that Anne had to live through makes Evelyn Lau's little stint on the streets look like a walk in the park by comparison."
3,"It's OK, but it is no Downton Abby","I bought this because I cannot get enough of Downton Abby. It does deliver somewhat, and it is written well with accurate historical details, but unless you are into war history, forget it. About 2/3 of the content details battles, hospitals and meetings with officers...in other words, boring. I actually read 5/6 of it and just couldn't finish it because it wandered into such tedium."
2,Boring,This is certainly not anything close to the richness of a similar tv series. I could not connect or get interested in one character and actually found it a chore to read. I stopped halfway through.
2,Very Misleading!!!!!! Not the Original First Album!!,"This is NOT the original first album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is ""live"",..the songs are slowed down...and it lacks the energy of the REAL first album. This is VERY misleading and an extreme slap in the face to fans."
5,Bring on the SNOWBALL OF DOOM!!!!!!!!!,"Racer X does it again with Snowball Of Doom. As stated on their website, ..., years ago, a record exec told them, they had a chance like a snowball in hell. Well, 16 years later their response is simple....We ARE the Snowball Of Doom...Rolling, Rolling and Rolling! SOD updates several old songs from Extreme Volume, like Into The Night and Hammer Away. FINALLY!! Scarified Live!! The rest of the songs are mostly from Technical Difficulties and Superheroes. The CD is a bit different than the prior works, as Paul Gilbert masterfully covers all guitar duties and Bruce is no longer in the band, but no matter. I was at the Whisky show where this was recorded on May 25th, 2001 and it definitely faithfully reproduces the live show. Prepare for chills on Godzilla as Paul simply shreds during a freewheeling, unscripted BASS SOLO!! Rock!!"
2,really basic info. too basic,"it's really basic info. too basic. he should follow up with more details like how to tie rigs, tie hooks etc... i'm going to show this to childern for basic 101. for people who never fished before it's a good basic info.."
1,NOT WHAT YOU THINK,This item Amazon is offering IS NOT the original 1986 album that their description implies. It is a compilation that bears little resemblance to the track listing of the original 1986 recording.
3,A good remake could be chilling,Inconsistent but reasonably good. The protracted lead-in to the core of the film works surprisingly well as we get comfortable with the characters who will eventually be endangered. Primarily this movie deserves attention for bursting taboos regarding violence by and toward children in unsettling yet credible ways. I'd rather like to see a remake - a good remake of this could be chilling.
2,Children who are a little outta hand!,"You can tell after watching for about 10 minutes that this movie was made a while ago. Not from the setting but the flow of the timing of the movie. It moves very, very slow. Nothing happens for about 45 minutes. Then what does happen isn't really exciting to audiences of today. The film draws you in. It leads you thru the paces of a man and his pregnant wife visiting a fishing village that contains muderous children. It then gives you no clue as to how the children came to be this way. If you wanna waste a coupla hours just to see what this flick holds, fine. If you're expecting a horror movie with closure, pass."
3,Started out fine then turned boring,"I read the ""The Witness"" over a 3 day period and I had a struggle to keep reading it. The story is okay nothing to praise and the writing was weak. I have read other books by Ms. Brown and I have enjoyed some of them, but this one just didn't seem to be very interesting. She is a great writer and I'll probably pick up another novel by her. However it will be through the library just in case. Overall, it's not a terrible book, just an easy beach read."
4,"""Witness"" is Powerfully Written","Ms. Brown has brought us another powerfully written romantic thriller. In ""The Witness"", we meet Kendall Deaton, a strong, loving, woman on the run.From the opening setting of a horrid auto accident to her runaway life with her pseduo-husband....the authoress keeps us turning the pages as fast as we can read them.A great romatic read for summer or any season!Thanks--CDS"
5,Exciting Throughout!,I have real all 40 something novels by Sandra Brown. I think she does an outstanding job on all of her stories and as it is with most writers they seem to get better through the years. I have to admit however even though I enjoy her thrillers I still enjoy her romance novels better. My all time favorite is Seduction by Design. I remember the first time I read the book (and I have read it hundreds of times since the 80's when it first came out) that I actually felt each and every word play out in my mind as I read the story. I enjoy Ms. Brown's novels and know you will too.
1,Excessively graphic violence: The only book I've ever returned without finishing,"I do not want to spoil the book for anyone, but since I didn't finish it, I really am not. I just think that before people read this, there should be some sort of warning. I had read Sandra Brown for years and nothing I'd read before had prepared me for this. I was so horrified by the recounting of what she had witnessed that I threw up, had nightmares that night, and still, more than 12 years after reading this, still wish I could have brain bleach to forget I ever read it. I returned it because I wanted to make sure the bookstore understood what was in it.I still love Sandra Brown. It took me a few years to read anything else new by her, but once I did I remembered why I feel in love with her stories. I don't want to discourage anyone who can stomach the violence from reading this - until that point, I was enjoying this book just as I have nearly every Sandra Brown before and since."
5,Sandra does not disappoint,I love Sandra Brown. She is my all time favorite writer. This one will take about a day to read you will not be able to put it down. I love the different twist and turns and the shadiness of the characters.
3,Creepy To The Core,The most redeeming aspect of The Witness was the villians. I'll admit I'm not a Sandra Brown fan but I picked this one up for the high ratings it received. I did enjoy it for the dark and twisted plot as well as the disturbing characters. It was not a who-dunit but more of a look into the lives of some twisted individuals. As for the hero John and the heroine Kendall; I found them rather typical for the romance genre. I thought all of the secondary characters were great but it seemed as if the romance aspect was thrown in for the die-hard Brown audience. Overall it was a good thriller with a little mystery and average romance.
1,This book should be R-rated.,"If you want to read a smut-filled novel this would be a great choice. There is way too much detail involved in sexual events that happen in this book. There was a vividly-horrid violent scene written about in this book also. This was a choice for our book club one month, and only 2 people (of 7) were able to continue reading all the garbage that was in the book. The others refused to read such filth. For those who like to keep their mind out of the gutter, this book is not a good choice."
1,Blech,"I couldn't wait to get done with this book. The first few chapters were good and then it just got silly and totally unbelievable. I cannot begin to tell you how many times the main character was going to leave, run away, and yet was always stopped - and always in the same dumb way. This truly was a relief to finish so I could go on to another book. I felt like Ms. Brown just phoned this book in. Don't waste your time!"
5,Great Story! Great Deal!,"This is the first story I ever heard from author Sandra Brown. She has a terrific and suspenseful way of telling her stories. I recommend this story, my favorite by her. The item was well packed, promptly shipped, and well received. Glad I made this purchase. Amazon makes things like this happen."
5,Great Reading,"Typical Sandra Brown--entertaining, full of suspense, and keeps you guessing. If you've never tried her, this is a good place to start."
4,Shocking!,This was the first book I had ever read by Sandra Brown. Since then I have been a fan. She is really my favorite author. And it doesn't hurt that she's from my home state!
5,Don't read if you have to get up early,"Sandra Brown is an amazing writer. I just started reading her books and The Witness, The Alibi...outstanding. I have to make a point not to pick up one of her books when I'm busy and have to get up early."
3,"Pretty Good, But Not Great","Unlike other comments that have been posted, I actually found this one a little hard to read. I felt sick to my stomach when reading a few parts (I won't say which ones because I don't want to spoil the book.) It was a little too graphic for my taste. But, it does however keep your attention and is fast pace. And yes, there is in fact romance in it as well. If you are a true Sandra Brown fan then you'll probably like it. However if you are not currently a Brown fan and are considering reading this one first.... don't. I would recommend Mirror Image or Charade even for first picks. Of course you can never go wrong with any of her purely romantic books. All in all it was ok, but not one of my favorites."
1,Is she serious?,"I've read several of Sandra Brown's books and enjoyed them. But this book was horrible. The plot and characters were both so bad, it was almost painful trying to get through the book. The characters are silly cartoon-like stereotypes, and the town secret is so ridiculous that it will leave readers shaking their heads in amazement - amazement that an author could come up with something so stupid. Don't waste your money, and if you do buy it, have some aspirin handy, because the book will give you a headache."
3,Someone doesn't like conservativism,"This is my third Sandra Brown novel and I can't help but notice that this author does not like conservative politics. Granted this novel condemns the extreme right and an awful breed of people who belong to a hateful cult type group not much different than white supremacy groups, this isn't the first time her novels have classified almost all traditional-type people as freaks.Of Brown's novels I have read so far, her characters are all alike. They are usually man-hating, independent women-types whom have a secret (or vendetta) that you won't learn until the end of the book. This keeps the reader turning the pages, but gets old fast.In THE WITNESS, there are two stories that run parallel to each other. The main plot was completely unbelievable and hardly developed enough to be the slightest bit believable. However, the parts concerning Kendal, the Fed & her life on the run were the only reason I continued to read. They were written well, very suspenseful, and sexy."
1,A Failure on all counts,"As someone of Irish descent and one who has traveled extensively throughout Ireland, I thought this would be a fun read. Sadly, it wasn't. The plot is ridiculously convoluted with no logic whatever to the ""clues"" and no good explanation as to how they are interpreted. The dialogue is absurd with one character even reduced to speaking backwards for several chapters (and does that ever get annoying)! As to the Irish accents, one can only shake one's head as characters seem to develop it then drop it all in the same sentence. This book, which I honestly had hoped to like, is a real stinker. If you're looking for a good mystery, this isn't it, and if you're looking for a good book with Irish locales and plot, this isn't it either. Don't waste a penny on this one."
1,The Celtic Riddle: An Archeological Mystery,"Being of Irish descent and having travelled throughout Ireland, I thought this would be a fun book to read. It wasn't. If there was an award for cliche filled tripe, this would win first prize. The writing is awful, the plot unbelievable (if there's any logic whatsoever to the treasure hunt clues I missed it, and defy any other reader to explain it) and the dialogue as bad as I've ever read. One of the characters even speaks backwards for several chapters! The attempts at Irish speech turn on and off, even within sentences. One has to wonder what the editor was thinking to have let such poor writing pass as a story. I really did want to like this book but I just can't recommend it or any others by Ms. Hamilton. There are numerous other books out with an Irish theme or locale and one should look for those before ever wasting money on this effort."
5,Mystery in the Myths of Ireland,"Lara Mc Clintoch, who ones an antiquary in Toronto, accompanies his friend Alex to a testament lecture in southwest Ireland. Much of a surprise for everybody Alex receives Rose Cottage. More than this Eamon Byrne left one clue to everybody before dieing. His hope was to see the whole family to work again together for a great treasure hunt in the ancient story of Ireland, with all the myths related to. But something goes wrong and somebody gets killed. Will anybody find the great treasury? Will somebody get killed again ?Lyn Hamilton wrote a brilliant story, which you would never stop reading. The suspense killes you as you discover slowly, piece at piece, the mistery behind. And you discover as well, as you were travelling with here throughout Ireland, the legends and the myths of the Celts. Perhaps with the best book of her with THE XIBALBA MURDER, her first novel published."
1,Very disappointing,"I don't know how long the author spent in Ireland, but if she went at all it couldn't have been for very long. Having spent much time there myself, I found the characters so weakly and stereotypically developed as to be unconvincing, even irritating, and I never finished the book. Too contrived."
4,Good system but answering machine could be clearer,"The phone has very good quality and is a good buy for the price. The negatives are the quality of the sound from the answering machine could be clearer. Also if you mount this on the wall, the answering machine controls are on the top and you need to be tall to see them. It is fine if placed on a desk."
4,good phone,"I received this phone about 6 months ago. It is easy to use and works well. It doesn't have the clearest reception, which I suspect is because the base is right next to the transmitter for our wireless internet (and our cable box, and our tv)."
4,Good Phone,"After a few months I am very pleased with the ip5850. Answering machine feature is way better than any stand alone machine I've ever owned. Biggest positives about this phone are excellent reception/range and quality of speaker phone. It would warrant a 5-star rating if the buttons were laid out a bit better, but that is really a picky detail."
2,Warning check battery and bad customer service,"Mine worked great for the first few months, then I started getting the ""warning, check battery"". If you take the batteries out and reinsert, it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up. It happened on both headsets. I called customer service and they told me this is the first time they've ever heard that (uh huh - doesn't sound like it from the reviews here). A little too expensive to replace yearly..."
2,CUSTOMER IN LA,"I am looking for a new phone, becuase i have the same problems with batteries that work only for 30 minutes or so. I have tried to get new batteries though VTech, but they cannot be reached and will respond to email. I will not by vtech again"
1,"Bad battery, bad static = bad phone","Don't waste your money on this phone. From the first day the non-base unit had horrible static for anyone I talked to. The sound was fine on my end, but anyone I talked to on the non-base phone complained of horrible static, and when I called my house I heard it too and they were right it was horrible. The base unit developed the same charging and battery problems a number of others have already talked about. Avoid at all costs."
1,Broke in second week of use!,"One of the handsets broke in the second week of use. Come to find out, my father had the same problem with the same phone. Amazon promptly sent me a replacement, which was great customer service. It works fine now with the exception of one of the handsets sounds like there's an echo. I would not recommend these phones."
1,"Looks great, works terrible!","We bought this phone for it's features and competitive price. It worked wonderfully for the first month. The dual phones were a great idea as we have dual level home. We wanted all the functions this phone had to offer. WONDERFUL!Then, after a month (by the way, Amazon would not take it back and we could not get help from VTech). The phone went fuzzy, would not ring half the time...but the caller ID still worked!I would NOT recommend this product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! We ended up just throwing the piece of junk away.No wonder this item is on sale."
1,The one year disposable phone...not more.,"Worked ok for one year, but then battery would not recharge. I bought a new set of battery, sames story, so I guess the handset are mal functioning. Now for the last 6 months (1.5 year after purchase) the communication drops after 5mins which is really really anoying. I would not recommend buying this phone. I would not recommend buying V-Tech at all, as I think the design of the phones and the quality are really poor."
2,Hmmmmmmmmm......,not great phones...lots of static & the battery life is rubbish!im getting new ones!
3,short lived,This phone needs to be replaced after only a couple of years. Speaker phone breaks up and battery is short lived.
1,disappointed,"these phones were certainly not 'as advertised'........one phone shorted out and actually arced when attempting to charge......(I have returned this phone, tho' still have not received credit).the set we kept, has much static...first time I can remember being dissatisfied with purchase from Amazon......."
2,Bust After TwoYears,"I bought this phone two years ago. For the most part, the phone has been reliable. But like another reviewer said, the batteries die, and can only be revived by removing from the phone and reinserting. This lasts for about 12 hours, and then it happens again. I should note, that his only happened randomly up to now. Now it happens routinely.Ergonomically, the phone is also awkward. The disconnect button can be easily triggered while talking. Very frustrating.I'm getting a new phone.... and not a VTech!"
1,not worth it,"V-Tech will not honor any warranty unless purchased directly from them. The belt clips are next to useless as they break under light stress. V-tech promises to ship replacements, but after 3 months and numerous lengthy on-hold calls, still no replacement clips. I'll never buy V-Tech again based on terrible customer service. No visual display of messages waiting. Some channels have weak connections requiring redialing of the connection.Disgusted with V-Tech"
2,No Replacement Parts,"I do like the phone. But I'm giving it a low rating because of VTech's policy regarding replacement parts. If anything fails, you must replace the whole phone. I'm just over the warranty period, and the small handset charger has stopped working. Everything else works fine. The answer seems simple -- just buy a new little handset charger. But you can't do that. I discovered that, because it's a dual handset phone, VTech's policy is to replace the whole thing, or replace nothing. So, unless I wish to purchase a whole new system, I'm stuck with one phone that can be charged and one that cannot."
2,Another CHECK BATTERY problem,"You get what you pay for - got the phone in fall 2005, and started experiencing the dreaded ""Check Battery"" problem noted in multiple reviews here on Amazon.The phone works great when it does work - albeit the battery life is a little too short for my own liking.Other problems noted after 1+ years - the LCD display seems to be bleeding/not showing certain pixesl now. Battery life is short."
2,Not made to last,"So far, I've had 3 Vtech cordless phones. The sound quality and range on all have been very good. But all 3 phones developed the same problem after a couple of years. The keypad simply starts going bad; you have to press harder and harder on the keypad for the number you are pressing to register. Eventually, pressing hard doesn't work either.If you want a 'disposable' Vtech phone for light use for a year or two, you may be fine. But, if you expect many years of use from a purchase, their phones may not be right for you!"
1,NICE PHONE BUT....,"Nice phone, and loved the fact that it uses rechargeable NiMH batteries. However, I've only been using one handset since I bought this phone. One of the handset recieved is not working properly. ""Warning! Check Battery"" is on display. I already replaced with a new rechargable NiMH battery and receive the same error. If you swap batteries with the good handset, the malfunctioning handset will still display the same error. I'm in the military and currently stationed in Japan. With the warranty service(product replacement) of Vtech company, it is not possible for me to return the product to them since the company don't accept PO BOX, FPO or APO address.I believe no customers should even go through the pain of trying to get warranty service for a purchased brand new product.This is my first Vtech phone, it has great features maybe if the handset is working, warranty service not so good. Overall, I'm not impressed."
3,Battery problems,"These phones do have a lot of nice features, but I have had recent trouble I cannot fix. I have had the base plus 3 handsets for about a year or so. A few months ago, it sounded like someone was picking up an extension while I talked. That wasn't possible, but you could hear what sounded like someone coming on the line and then clicking off. I had the phone company check the line and there was no problem there. I changed batteries and that helped for a day or two. I am constantly recharging the batteries to try to avoid this. I assume it is a problem with the phone, so I have shopping for another."
2,Worked Great..... For AWHILE,"I got this phone because my apartment had limited phone outlets this was the perfect solution. We were happy with it for about 1 and 1/2 years, had more features then we used. Then one day the batteries stopped charging we spent $20.00 on new batteries then wiht the new batteries it kept displaying a error message ""SEARCHING..."". I called the customer line and was treated like an idot. The representative took me through the trouble shooting process which I had done from the manual several times. He finally told me to move the base if that didn't help that was it. I moved the base and it didn't help.... I now have a pile of electronics with VTECH printed on it."
5,Great Value,I recently purchased this phone because of the amount of features for the price. I enjoy having multiple mailboxes and it is a hard feature to find. I found that most multi headset phones had just a standard answering machine. The phone sound quality is good. We like having the speakerphone on both headsets. The set up was easy to figure out if you do not like reading manuals. I have had VTech phones for years and I have never had any problems. But probably the best thing is that you can use rechargeable batteries.
1,worthless answering system,"I do not like this unit. The quality of the incoming messages is very poor. 5 in 10 messages are hard to understand, 1 in 10 messages is simply not understandable. The tape answering machine I had 20 years ago was better. The speakerphone is not good either. It often skips a word and you have to ask the person at the other end often to repeat a word. Definitely not worth the money."
3,Vtech is greedy for money,"This phone used to come with rechargable ""AAA"" batteries that are cheap to replace. Now it comes with a proprietary Vtech ""battery pack"" that is much more costly. Lame! I will not buy more Vtech products."
5,I OWN THIS PHONE SYSTEM AN EXCELLENT BUY YOU CANNOT GO WRONG,"I OWN THIS PHONE SYSTEM AND BOUGHT SEVERAL AS HOLIDAY GIFTS.THE VOICE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD RECEPTION IS GOOD.I DID NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS AS OTHER REVIEWERS.I DO HAVE A TRIPPLITE SURGE PROTECTER IN MY PHONE SYSTEM.I DID GET A LITTLE HISS WHEN I BYPASSED,THE SURGE PROTECTER.THIS PHONE IS A LTTLE SENSITIVE TO STATIC ELECTRICITY. HAS ANYONE OUT THERE HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM ?"
1,Incompatible with my set-up or just static?,"The reception on the phone was terrible, with static so loud and constant that I couldn't hear anything else. I don't know if this was a phone defect, incompatibility with my VOIP service, or interference from other devices in my home or adjacent apartments (though I don't own a router or other wireless products). I would not recommend this item. A 2.4 GHz phone by AT&T worked without any problems under the same conditions. Try that."
1,False sense of Security,"We bought this phone because it was suppose to be the best and the spread spectrum was ""military grade""But we were wrong. We use voip which means there are NO phone lines outside to tap into. So the spread spectrum should be perfect. NOT!A minimum of three times a day our phone reflects ""Parallel Handset in use"" while we are talking on the phone. We hear the other party dialing and starting their conversation on our line.After about 20 seconds it does fix itself- but it should not happen in the first place. Don't count on Vtech to help either. Their response is that if someone else also has the Vtech 5.8 in our neighborhood our lines will cross. So much for their ""spread spectrum"" they are using."
2,Nice features but one handset stopped charging,"This phone has some really nice features like speakers so you can do handfree and i never hear other people talking on my line that was so annoying with my old 900 MHZ phone.Something i don't like include: flimsy battery cover, not convenient to mute the phone which i like to do while i sleep. But the biggest trouble is two months into its life, one handset stopped charging. It will not charge on either charger. I can take its battery out and put it in the other handset and it charges fine. So now i am going to sent it back to Vtech and only hope the return process will be smooth and the replacement will be trouble free."
3,"Seems quality, but reverb in handset","Seems like a decent phone, no problems with static, works great outside....but at least one of the handsets has reverb when talking. For this reason, I'll probably return for another of the same or something different."
3,"Pretty good phone, but there may be better","We purchased this from Amazon a little less than one year ago. The features of this phone are great (speakerphone, shared address book, call waiting caller ID, 3 mail box answering machine, etc). Getting everything set up was a piece of cake, though it did take some time to get the address book set up. The phone worked great, but there are some cons...- the batteries only lasted about 7 months (and you have to buy expensive vtech replacements)- the base station handset has a lot of static now (just started happening).- the other hand set will no longer answer calls.- the other hand set caller ID no longer works.So, we'll see how good their 1 year warranty is. I don't have the original packaging anymore so they may not accept it..."
4,You can share calls with multiple handsets by pressing On,"The key feature for me is to be able to share incoming calls with all the handsets.When there is an incoming call, the first handset can pick up the call. Then the second handset can also pick up the call just by pressing On. And you have a three way conversation.There are a lot of cordless phones but only a few can do this in such a simple way. Most of the time, the first handset has to select 'transfer call' or 'open 3 way conference' and I can tell you this is really a pain. You have to yell through the house and the garden to get this done. You can't just pick up the call.So I would heavily recommend this phone.Also neat: backlight for keys and LCD (have you ever try to call when it's dark and you can't see the keys?)I gave it 4 stars because it seems I've bought a set that does not extend beyond 2 handsets. There is another one which extend to 5 handsets and I wish I had bought this one."
3,"Great Phone, Answering Machine kills me...","I will say this, so far I love the phone part, and get a kick out of the fact it uses rechargable batteries.But one point about the answering system makes me almost HATE the whole thing. You have to erase a message DURING the message. If you press 'Erase' as soon as you've heard the whole message, it erases the NEXT message. Since you don't know when a message is gonna end, this machine basically makes you listen to all messages first. This KILLS me. ALL other machines I've used have a pause at the end where you can press 'erase' and it'll erase the previous message.Like I said, great phone. Answering machine pisses me off by wasting my time."
1,Battery Died Even On Charger,"After 2 years, the battery would randomly die even though it's sitting on the charger. You have to take it out and place it back in to charge it. It's frustrating to have the phone not working when you needed it especially since it's been sitting on the charger for days"
1,Pure Junk!!!!,"Bought the system 2 1/2 years ago and it broke down just over 1 year later when the warranty expired (of course). Bought another one because I thought it was a good deal(what was I thinking?) and guess what? It broke down after 18 months. One phone was inoperable.Besides, you can't see the how much of a charge the phone has left after it is out of the base. Stay away from V-Tech or A.T.&T.as; they bought V-Tech a while back and make the phones.Had a Panasonic long ago and it lasted 10+ years. Just bought a new Panasonic and am very pleased with it so far. Much better system."
1,Battery Big Problem,"We have had this phone for about 18 months now and the batteries on both phones are dead. I see now that this is consistent with the experience of many other users. Of course the batteries require a special order and each appear to cost $21 - so you'll end up paying the cost of this phone every year to 18 mo., that is if the battery even lasts that long after being replaced. Very dissappointing because this phone is otherwise great. Good features, nice style, works well with Vonage and our wireless network. We are now buying a Panasonic and are completely turned off of Vtech."
2,Phone is not worth $75,"This phone sucks. I got this only month ago. The second handset whenever I put it on the charger complains about ""CHECK BATTERY"".I have to remove the battery and put it back in grrrrrrrrrrr.Charge does not hold more than a day. Overall, bad phone. go buy some other phone."
1,Not so Great,After having this phone for about 2 years I am now looking for a new one. The batteries don't carge in the base because of a loose fitting phone. I have had to buy rechargable NiMH batteries and charge them so I can have a phone that works instead of getting a check battery message on the phone every time I go to pull it from its base. now the number buttons seem to be having a bit of a problem as it takes 2-3 times pressing the number 6 before it will acknowledge it.I'm not overly impressed by this product. I think I will be switching brands. I've had v-Tech phones for >10 years.
2,Very poorly written,"This book reads like a terrible translation. Sometimes I was able to figure out what the author was trying to say, but there were several passages that were so poorly written I suspected that entire words were either missing or accidentally added. This is not an occasional problem - it is in every single paragraph and practically every sentence. The editors did the author a real disservice by not either requiring him or having someone else rewrite this book so that it was clear and easily read. Books on this subject are often hard to understand - it's a complex subject - but the problem with this book isn't the difficulty of the material. It's practically incomprehensible in places, and completely frustrating throughout, due solely to its abysmal writing. No offense to the author, as I suspect English is his second language and I believe he has some good information here. But unless this book is completely rewritten it is not worth your money."
2,"Lots of words, no information","I bought a Kindle edition of this book after reading the reviews. What a disappointment. Words, words, words... Lots of words. yet the book could easily be edited into one third of its size. Sure, there is some information on strength training, but large amount of info in it is amateurish and dated. There is no nutritional value in animal protein, really?The book is about the essentials of weightlifting, but the author seems to believe he is competent to dish his opinion on many other areas of life. Mind you, he even comments on homosexuality. There are lots of musings that are of no practical and even theoretical value.I am very disappointed with the book and am returning it."
3,The book is so-so,"I think the book is okay; it's a little overpriced. Some of the information is outdated and contradictory to more recent studies. The book can also be a little dry at times, reading more like a technical manual. I feel some of the drawings and illustrations could be more clear. The author relies on poor drawings to illustrate lifting techniques."
5,Thorough Weight Training Book,"What I liked: coverage of the different types of weight training (power lifting, body building, etc.), great description of body shortcomings (too stiff, weak arms, shoulders) and possible remedies, form for different lifts, interesting Egyptian history and training methods over time (40+ yrs), Q&A; sectionWhat I didn't like: 1st edition binding unraveling, small print, overwhelming size of information, sometimes dry writing styleWho should buy this? those looking beyond the basics and wanting something more integrative & descriptive approach - whole body lifting"
2,Get an Editor,"I had high hopes for this book, but was a bit disappointed. English is not the author's native language so it makes sense that he and the publisher would have found a good and patient editor to go through and render the volume into correct and readable English. They didn't, and the book is barely readable as a result. Don't waste your time. If you need information on general strength training then just get the third edition of ""Starting Strength"" by Rippetoe. If you need information on weightlifting, then look elsewhere."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Maybe you've seen it in the bookstores: a coffee-table sized book, almost 600 pages long, with an accompanying CD-ROM of speeches and other recordings. A great gift for an American history buff? Don't be fooled. I found it at the library and it turned out to be a huge disappointment. It has little to say and almost no visual impact compared to a book like ""The American Century."" Obviously at this point in time, Stephen Ambrose is coasting on his reputation."
4,First person accounts give new perspective to history,"I've been a huge Stephen Ambrose fan since reading his biography of Nixon years ago. This book dispays Ambrose's flair for research, and ability to make the past come alive. This time, however, rather than using his own prose to set the scene, he has compiled a collection of accounts from people who were there. It's not textbook history, and it doesn't always present events from an objective view, but it is nevertheless an effective and fascinating read."
4,Perspective of history,"I love the way he lets people who were present tell the story. It is very enlightening, not your normal text book history. It is a must read for anyone with an open mind."
2,what went wrong?,"It seemed like it would be a smashing album. But after a listen to it i felt i had been ripped off 17$. The mixing is slow dull and lets you fall asleep. Disc 2 is simply bad, the annoyingly sample filled carnival xiii hurts to listen too, With west on the 27th being the only highlight. This disc has parks in wilson is slow mellow form. Disc 1 is a little better. slightly faster. but still nothing impressive."
1,Another boring one from 2 unquestionably talented producers!,"Short and sweet, this is a flawlessly mixed 2 CD set of extremely boring tunes!A lot of people say that progressive house is boring. The fact is it doesn't have to be - there are a lot of amazing and exciting tunes out there, so it can all depend on what the DJ chooses to play.In this case Parks ans Wilson have chosen to play a lot of boring tunes! (as their Tilt partner, John Graham, did with Transport 5!)But, it all comes down to taste and personal preference. You may like it. I just don't find it very exciting at all. And I LOVE progressive house.BEWARE!5 stars for mixing - negative 5 stars for track selection!"
4,Great for beginners,"This is a very well made DVD. The setting is beautiful and the demeanor of the instructor is very pleasing. However, with the Title ""Power Yoga"" I purchased it with the expectation it was a more advanced yoga workout. Actually it is for beginners. Although the poses are basic, the transitions from pose to pose are quick and I found it to be frustrating to follow since I prefer advanced poses being held for a longer period of time."
1,Boring.,I couldn't do this more than once out of sheer boredom. I will not recommend it to others. There are other Yoga videos that are much better than this one.
1,slow down,"I bought this dvd because Rodney Yee is so highly recommended by others...even this dvd comes with praise by most viewers. However, this dvd is for ""beginners"" and doesn't come with any instruction about the poses or any ""teaching"" section. Rodney begins quickly and the dvd is very fast-paced---as if the viewer is a yoga expert and the routine a basic one. I would appreciate the workout if there was a preview section of the poses...or if Rodney would simply tell us what is coming up next. Not good for beginners."
5,Just What I Needed!,"I love this DVD! I workout at least 6 days a week running/lifting weights, and after a lower back injury I felt it was a sign that I needed to do more stretching. This workout is perfect to do in between harder workouts and leaves me feeling renewed. Plus, I love that it's only 30 minutes! Would recommend it to anyone that wants to become more flexible and feel more relaxed!"
2,disappointed,I use the Gaim yoga series on a regular basis. I enjoy yoga and need to improve my flexibility and thought this would be the perfect dvd. The positions move to quickly from one to the next to be beneficial for flexibility and is very quick moving for the true beginner. I would recommend a.m. p.m. yoga for beginners and power yoga for total body.
2,I'm not new to Yoga...this moves too quickly,The poses are good but not one of them is held long enough. Yoga really shouldn't be done in 20minutes anyway. Scenery is beautiful and instructions are clear but it just moves too quickly.
1,doesn't flow,"This workout doesn't flow and is a very boring workout. The half hour feels like 2 hours. Bryan Kest gives a better more intense workout with great flow leaving you feel refreshed as well as having worked muscles and the 50 minutes goes in no time. Or try ""quickfix power yoga"" for a 30 minute workout."
2,DOESN'T WORK IN DVD PLAYER and too fast,This DVD only works in a laptop - not our DVD player which is hooked up to our my TV. It's short and too fast.
1,Not received item yet...,"It's been over 4 weeks, and I have not received the DVD yet. I didn't think it was going to take this long. I hope I get it soon; otherwise, I may not buy from this seller again."
2,A different kind of yoga,"Im not a yoga guru by any means, but I found this dvd a bit difficult to follow, the terms were all new for me and I would look at the dvd to find the insructor several moves ahead of me without what I felt what clean and timely instructions."
2,Too fast for Beginners. Too fast for Flexibility,"I Like Rodney Yee's AM Yoga so much that I thought I'd try this one also. As a beginner, I felt that building flexibility is important, so I got this video. I tried it for a week but decided to go back to other yoga for beginners video since there is little instructions and the pace is simply too fast. In a few months, maybe I'll try it again, but I am concerned that the he doesn't hold the poses long enough for us to work on the stretch, which is key in building up flexibility. I am going back to Barbara Banagh for now, because her pace is perfect for the beginner and her videos offer a good selection of routines in various lengths and levels of rigor, so they are more versatile."
4,"This is not for beginners, but perfect for continuing students","If you are a beginner, skip this DVD and purchase it after you have acquired general knowledge of yoga poses. With that in mind, I found this DVD relaxing and helpful. I'm a returning ballet dancer who has lost a lot of her flexibility. I've taken yoga off and on in the past and find that this workout builds upon the basics (utilizing modified sun salutations) to help increase your flexibility. This yoga workout moves quickly and is only 25 mins, excellent for busy people (who has time to do an hour and a half yoga workout before work?). I would recommend most of Rodney Yee's workouts (including am and pm yoga)."
5,Great for the morning wake up...,"I think this DVD is great. I thought I would have gotten tired of using the same FLEXIBILITY DVD when I bought this so I bought another one from a different series. I have only used that one long enough to see what it was about. I have used this DVD just about everyday. It's great for ""loosening"" up in the morning when you don't have time for a complete exercise program. Again...GREAT FOR EVERYDAY."
3,"Too fast, not for beginners.","Having not done yoga for many years, I need a little more instruction than this allows. This is too fast with too little actual teaching for beginners."
3,Rushed for sure!,"While I certainly agree that the video is rushed, I compensate by waiting for him (Rodney) to complete the pose then pause the video and hold each pose as long as I feel necessary to get the full benefit. While, yes, this does extend the time required for the video, I wish to reap the rewards of the movements. I do not put a rush on any stretching /flexability routines regardless of the instructor!"
2,Beginner Beware!,"The yoga postures in this DVD are incredibly rushed. Unless one is already very familiar with the poses by name and technique, it's very difficult to follow. There's no focus on breathing at all, just running through the postures. I was very disappointed and am returning to Amazon."
2,TOO FAST:-(,"I had better hopes for this workout. I deliberately ensured that I bought Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners, although I'm not a novice to Yoga, but wanted to ensure better form while doing the poses. It was very helpful and I felt ready to tackle Power Yoga - Flexibility.I don't particularly like voice-overs, but I don't make a big deal out of it..My main problem is that aside from the flow being too fast, his instructions and what he's actually doing are not in sync, which made it sometimes difficult to follow. This resulted in an unfulfilling short workout. I'm a bit disappointed, but plan on persevering, especially since I also went ahead and bought his Total Body Workout as well."
1,"way to fast to be called ""flexibility""","This dvd is supposed to be about flexibility. How can you get flexible if you hold a pose for 5 seconds? Because that is exactly what it's like. And there is a lot of sun salutations but barely any poses. I know it's only 30 minutes long but if it is to make you flexible they should have skippped the many MANY sun salutations and held postures for at least 5 BREATHS. And speaking of breaths he barely prompts you to ""inhale/exhale"" but no emphasis on deep breathing or deep stretching. I am very disappointed in this DVD."
4,Good basic workout,"Good basic yoga workout. Helps to know the basics of yoga eg upward/downward dog, the rest is easy to pick up.Would recommend if after a workout to improve basic flexibility."
5,excellent!,This is such a great DVD. Everything you need to feel great is wrapped up in 25 minutes. This is not an intense yoga DVD giving a full workout - it really is perfect though for wringing your body out and feeling flexible. Could not ask for more in a 25 minute quick fix DVD!
5,"Outstanding, quick yoga workout!","I am extremely happy with the ""Power Yoga-Flexibility"" DVD! I predominantly use this DVD when I don't have time for a full yoga routine, but want a deep, fast-paced, but short practice. The only reason I deducted a star is because I don't think this DVD is necessarily for beginners. Given the fast-paced routine and flow between poses, I think it is best for those yogis who have a true understanding of the fundamental poses and have are in good physical shape. Enjoy this great DVD, it's worth the purchase; I wish I had purchased the whole series!"
3,So not for beginners!,"I've never done yoga before and this is defintely NOT for beginners. He jumps right into the routine and does really difficult poses immediately with no explanations. Fortunately I ordered Yoga Zone - Stretching for Flexibility at the same time. If you really are a beginner, like me, that is a better choice, without a doubt."
3,"good, but a little too fast","This is a good DVD, and I do like Rodney Yee's style, but just isn't my favorite. The pace is a little too rushed for my liking. I would recommend another DVD I recently purchased called ""Yoga for Power and Flexibility"". The instructor gives enough time for each posture, and there are multiple voice over options as well. Would recommend that one instead."
3,"Not that great, but pretty good for a short workout","This workout is great if you don't have a lot of time. Otherwise it feels rushed, and I don't get as much out of it as other DVDs I have. Therefore it usually isn't the one I go to. You can get lots of better routines for less money from Eoin Finn."
3,Too fast,"I know 25 minutes isn't long for a yoga routine, but Rodney speeds through this series. There is no time to spend focused on any of the poses, as by the time you get into one, he's already moved on to the next one. It's a good series of poses, it just goes through them about 30% too fast."
5,I tried three and this was the best one!,"I wanted to find a good Almond oil for salads. So I tried this one, and 'Sweet Almond Oil' by Oleic Bovera (more expensive) and 'Alive, Organic Almond Oil' by Living Tree Community Foods (less expensive). I like Jean LeBlanc French Almond Oil the best because it smells like almonds. The other two really don't. I'm guessing that the one that actually smells like almonds has to be better for my health (wider range of oil soluble vitamins and less extreme processing methods).I'm only going to buy this one going forward!"
2,"""Adventure"" Guide for Tourists","Before my first trip to Belize, I bought several travel guides. The title of this book suggested an orientation toward the more active, adventurous traveler. From the way the author wrote, I don't think that she could have kept up with my 8-year-old.She seemed to value places that were quiet and comfortable. She seemed a bit intimidated or uninformed about some of the more active jungle type adventures.Belize is a great country to visit, both for the adventurous and for those who like to lie around on the beach. However, I bought this book expecting information about the more challenging types of vacation. Next time you write an ""adventure"" guide, send someone who likes to crawl through narrow cave entraces, hike through the jungle at night, and get wet and muddy."
2,Not the same book!,"We used Explore Belize, which was the guide written by Harry S. Pariser, when we last went to Belize. It was a new edition o Adventure Guide to Belize. It was a big improvement in style. Unfortunately, this guide is a step back. It's clunky, with poorly-drawn maps, and so so background information. We really feel deceived that this is being called a ""new edition."" !"
1,Find a different guide book,"I used this book as my main guide to Belize and was sorely disappointed. I stayed at two places recommended by the author and it seemed like she gets unduly influenced if the owner is personable or outgoing. One place in southern Belize she described as ""luxurious"", ""elegant"", and ""truly a treasure"". Not that I had a bad time, but there is no way anyone would describe it in those terms. Words like that mean things - was the author so naive or inexperienced as to believe them?The other place in Caye Caulker she rated extremely well and even suggested trying to get reservations ahead of time. Come on! It wasn't horrible, but not something you would go out of your way to obtain.At best, use this book as a secondary guide. If your vacation days are precious and you want to make best use of a trip to Belize, rely on a different guide."
5,A must,"Belize holds three of the four coral atolls in the Caribbean, hosts the world's only jaguar reserve, and has the highest waterfall in Central America. The author's updated book is a tour guide helping the adventure-oriented traveler take advantage of these rare visions as she tells how to make the most of Belize, from locating a local tour to visiting backroads and less traveled areas of the country. A must for any traveler who wants to experience the outdoors of the country.Library Bookwatch"
2,Doll dress not as Korean as hoped.,"I was disappointed in the quality of the dress. I also wish it had come with some explanation of the history of the dress. I would have preferred that it come it different colors. My Korean daughter-in-law wore a pink one at her wedding. This was absolutely the ONLY choice I had for an 18"" Korean doll dress, so I took it and my daughter-in-law appreciated my efforts. I'm not sure how it will hold up with use as the child who received it doesn't live with me."
4,"The Troggs, a great 60s british garage band!","I bought this cd a few years ago for $5 and I still listen toit very often. This band is more than just a one hit wonder(""Wild Thing!"") They had a few other hits that cracked thetop 100 in America. ""Love is All Around"" made the top 10 in1967. Other hits include "" With a Girl like You"" (if thissong doesn't remind you of innocent high school days then nothingwill!) and ""I Can't Control Myself!"" (this song created alotof controversey & was actually banned for the line: ""yourslacks are low & your hips are showin!"") Other stand outsinclude ""From Home""(great 60s mod guitar riffs after theverses) & ""Night of the Long Grass."" (subliminalmessage? you tell me!)... enjoy this great cd. It's a great intro to aband w/a very overlooked catalogue. Another tidbit, this band was ahuge influence on the early punk bands. Their sound was raw, loud,& grungy."
3,The books are much better,"Admission One: I discovered kundalini yoga through Ravi and Ana, so I am very biased. Saying that, Gurmukh has written some great books, especially the 8 human talents, which i completely love. I wished some of the teachings in the book were presented itself in the dvd. I thought the flowing sari was very off putting, and some of the camera work focused on Gurmukh when she was not in the pose and I really needed to see the pose. try it and see if this works for you."
5,WOW! Can't live without it!,"Kundalini Yoga is the most ancient yoga. All other yoga styles fall under this one. If you want to experience real yoga in raw form, this is it. It is the best bar none. I have fallen in love with Kundalini Yoga. There is nothing like it. There is an energy coiled lik a serpent in the base of your spine that goes up the spine. The goal of Kundalini is to awaken this energy to fill you with radiance. This isn't one of those ""ok now we're gonna do"" yoga's. This is truly a spiritual awakening. I recommend that everyone do this at least once a week if not more. What a great Yoga practice. I can't live without it. It has truly restored my life!"
5,My favorite DVD!,This is one of my favorite go to DVDs when I am in the mood to do more motion yoga and not just the poses. It's a great morning workout too - it gets you engerized for the day!
5,"Fun, effective workout","After dealing with back pain and general weakness for months, I finally decided to get proactive about the problem and start doing a daily workout. I'd tried this DVD once before, but had no idea of the incredible effect it can have in a very short amount of time. After starting to use it daily just a few weeks ago, I already feel much more limber and energetic all day. My aching back has disappeared, my arms and legs are significantly stronger, and I feel more clear-headed and lucid all day. I can personally attest that the claims on the back of the case, that it will ""give your body an active workout and help you develop inner peace and outer strength"" are entirely true.I highly recommend this program. Be aware that it's pretty strenuous, and I often find myself sweating heavily by the end, but if you do it every day, and really put some effort into it, you'll feel and look better very quickly."
2,Not my favorite,"I completely agree with Sally's review. I tried this tape a few years ago ( no DVD at that time) and injured myself due to the pace and intesity of the workout. It didn't take time to walk me into the postures nor allow for a breath between postures. It did not explain the process very well, just going from one position to another. If you're young and in good shape then you can do any exercise routine but unless you have practiced kundilini yoga for a few years I recommend not starting out with this one."
4,guilty pleasure,"You do this yoga with your eyes closed, I think because the moves are very silly and if you saw yourself or someone else doing this, you would fall over laughing. I tried this DVD for fun, not imagining it would be a challenge. I could not always keep up with the madly flailing 60 year old lady. The day after, I felt the workout in my thighs and arms. The instruction is not too concerned with form, more on movement and stamina. Much to my surprise I felt fantastic afterwards. I am not interested in ""Omming"" or chackras and serpents, and have learned to tune that kind of thing out of my workouts - although in this case, it makes it all the more fun. It is my guilty pleasure."
4,Great Yoga for when You're Absolutely Alone,"I loved this yoga--it left me with the tingly tired delicious feeling I get sometimes from bow pose. This is the real ""heart"" of yoga, I feel, apart from the desire to get a workout and a nice body.However, I definitely wouldn't want to be seen doing some of these poses by anyone! Though I do many types of strenuous yoga, I couldn't do everything here fully and it was kind of humbling--this is full of those exercises that look easy but really aren't. I borrowed it from the library and will definitely add it to my collection."
2,I've seen better,"I've been doing yoga DVD's for almost two years, about 2x/week on average. I went from unable to stretch at all to almost a full russian split, and very flexible & loose compared to most people. I love the the Ultimate Stretch Workout with Ana Brett & Ravi Singh which is also a thorough workout but was fun and left me stretched not tight. (...) I tried this DVD & the lack of form alone really turned me off. I couldn't even get beyond about 15 minutes . I'm only putting this review so you know that not everyone thinks it's the best yoga DVD out there."
3,Not bad but not great.,"I've been practising kundalini yoga for a while now. The dvds I love the most are ana & ravi's. I wouldn't say Gurmukh's dvd is bad, if you happen to be practicing regularly and have plenty of kundalini yoga DVD then this one would be OK to be part of the collection. but if you're new to kundalini yoga, please please skip this DVD and go look for ana & ravi's, they give better demonstration, introduction, and instruction. As other reviewers said this DVD is lack of manu, not a big deal for me but if you hate the gaiam ad and Gurmukh's introduction, then be aware. Also, this practise don't give enough Tuning-in therfore I don't feel fully prepared. Overall I think this DVD is do-able but it's got some weird punch and lack of tuning-in, relaxation, and instuction, so it's not really good for introdusing someone into kundalini yoga."
1,on 2nd viewing,it seems some of the exercises she gives breathing instructions and and on others (esp with fast twisting)no mention of breath at all.
4,good for orgainizing,"I am opening a childcare center and this book helped me to figure out what I had to buy before my building was finsished. The classrooms in this book are pretty busy and cluttered, but I was able to pick through what I didn't need pretty easily. I do have to say that the book was worth buying."
4,Nice doll.,I purchased this manikin to help me improve on my braiding skills. The hair is soft and manageable which is a perfect practice head for braiding.
3,Okay movie but too sentimental,I liked the movie because I'm interested in Arab culture. But the movie was too sentimental and feel-good-family type movie for my taste. I prefer more provocative movies like Paradise Now. Nadim Sawalha is an interesting actor. I'm glad to see long time supporting actors like him get a chance to be leads.
4,Homebuilders using composites,This is a good book. A large portion of the book (at the back) has exercises that you can do to try out your skills described in the book. The content is written very well and it is well illustrated. It presents the same content I have read in other books in a very nice fashion. Possibly the improved explanation is what commands the high price.
5,Mr. Smith's skill as a technical writer is excellent.,"Mr. Smith does a good job of explaining a subject that most readers will have no basic beforehand knowledge on. I am still digesting both of his latest books, but I am well pleased with them. You will need to actually do some of what he explains in his writings to get maximum benifit from his books, but I think his technical explanations will help a person to get started with this new technology."
2,Not All Alice,"The main point of focus on this much-released album is that there are two tracks which are NOT Alice Cooper. 'Aint That Just Like A Woman' and 'Goin To The River' are infact by Ronnie Hawkins (recorded at Hallmark Studios, Toronto, 1964). The other songs are for the most part mistitled . Sound quality is to be expected from a live recording of this era; muffled and at times rather unclear, but it is not the worst of the type. Musically you will find (from Alice) heavy, sometimes cacaphonic garage-psych tinged heavy rock. Interesting, but certainly one for psych and 60s completists only."
5,memories with food at gipsy house,"Beautifully illustrated and full of interesting stories, recipies and photographs, this book is perfect for reading on a cold or rainy day. Set in Gipsy House, the Dahl family home in England, the book lets you glimpse upper middle class life in that country. It's honesty makes it all the more enjoyable. The recipies are simple, yet interesting. They tempt you to experiment as they are very straight forward. This well written book is ideal for reading time and time again. It is full of SUNSHINE."
5,a rare look through the window of a famous author's home,"The recipes in this book are really fun. My favorite is Roald's Oxtail Soup. It reads like a short story instead of a traditional recipe. I wish more cookbooks were like this. This book gives the reader a glimpse into the home life of Roald Dahl and his family. Any fan of Dahl's books will enjoy this book. Quentin Blake has done some illustrations, (his alligator is amazing!) The recipes are enjoyable, home-style, and very do-able for cooks of all levels. Roald Dahl obviously had good taste and enjoyed living well; his recipes reflect that. This books is a must-buy for all Roald Dahl fans."
4,"Good book, could have used an editor","Further proof of the value of editors. There's a good book here and I could find it just by rearranging paragraphs. Interesting stuff, but completely disorganized. Why would the historical background be in the penultimate chapter?"
1,Gamecube X-Men Legends 2: ROA,My son got this for Christmas - the disc didn't work - comes up unreadable. Amazon quickly sent a replacement with the same results. I am left confused if there are lots of corrupt discs or is there something wrong with the gamecube. All of his other games work with his gamecube. Have others seen a problem with thses disc?
3,What I expected,"Its very similar to the first x-men legends, but has just very few upgrades. you can use the brotherhood characters also."
4,Fun if you like X-men,"When I ordered the seller said that it would take 4 weeks to receive. I got it in 3 days. Other than the order speed, I liked the changes in skills that X-men ledgends one doesn't provide. However, the story line is lacking. Players that don't know the X-men story should not get lost in the game, but I think that knowing the story makes the game just a little better. I gave it 4 out of 5 star for the overall rating because the bosses throughout the game were too easy while some of the other enemies were harder."
2,This is not a toy. LOL,"I was asked to rate this nipple as a toy. As a nipple, I give it a solid 4/5 stars. All babies get comfortable with a certain type of nipple. My son loved this when we used it after switching to a bottle and would not take anything else. However, if you are wanting this for its ability to change flow rates, don't bother. I did not appreciate a difference with the different settings. Still, my son will not take anything else (and it seems as though we tried them all!)."
2,Bihac,"I found Mr.O'shea's book interesting,especially the objective parts of it; interviews,letters and case stories. Several times though the objectiveness faltered and one had to read about the author's personal views and insignificant problems for ECCM personel, compared to what the Bihac people had to live thru. Accounts of how life in Bihac town was, stories from and about local people, and their views on how life in Bosnia might have ended had the US not broken the weapons embargo, were missing.And then perhaps a subjective epilog from the author on how to survive an onslaught by an army, which is supported with men and material from the JNA."
3,Low budget comedy,"The movie was okay and had some funny scenes, but at best, it was just okay. I should have waited until it came on public TV."
3,Quirky comedy,This is a fairly good and quirky comedy about a guy who has to repeat a class in summer school while dealing with his friends and others.
5,very informative and up to date. A time saver,We recieved the book from a promotion. It was easy reading and guided us step by step through what we thought would be a difficult process. It was basically effortless as we followed the tips and applied them to our situation.
1,Not so great,"If you know nothing about the internet, and have no idea where to start looking for wedding information, then you can use this book. But if you're like most people (if you're at this site reading this, you already know more than this book can tell you) this book is useless. You can get more out of the internet by going to any search engine and typing in ""wedding."" Seriously, try it, that's more than this book has to offer. Don't waste your money."
2,lorgnettes,"These were ok for the money. As a costume piece in theater they are too small and lack ""glitz"". It seems like the hinge won't last long."
5,"Heavenly, rich aroma and taste...","I had no problem switching from coffee to vanilla nut Teeccino. It is so rich in flavor and I don't need to add cream or sweetener. My husband drank a pot of coffee a day, heavily sweetened with sugar. Now he drinks a pot of teeccino with no sweetener or cream and loves it!We also enjoy the Hazelnut flavor."
4,coffee substitute,"I like this coffe substitute. it especially taste good with almond milk and a packet of stevia served on ice. however, it does have a bit of a tea taste to it. not bad though, wiil try other flavors!"
1,BORING...,I was forced to read this book for a college course. It's soooooo boring that I fell asleep every time I read it. Why do colleges subject us to these uninteresting textbooks???? Way too much technical jargon that don't make sense.
4,Great for the Money but...,"Great product. I listen to the CDs in my car to/from work in preperation for a language proficeincy test. Awesome review of grammar. Great price, but some of the language used is not current or unspoken in Moscow."
1,Living Language Ultimate Russian Advanced,"The course contains dialogues which are poorly translated from Russian to English. Also, the structure of the lessons do not reflect a particular learning theory. A teacher could make the program work, but I doubt that anyone has ever learned Russian on their own using the Ultimate Russian Program. Language is a social activity. I doubt that anyone can learn a language without interacting with others."
5,Damn good,"This is more of a faster, death metal sounding At The Gates than things you might hear on ""Slaughter Of The Soul"" and ""Terminal Spirit Disease."" It's got much lower production, so think of it sort of like Metallica's ""Kill Em All,"" where the music was good but it sounded like a garage demo. This is better than a demo, but it's obviously not recorded in the most expensive studio around. I recommend this for hardcore ATG fans."
3,"It's Good, but I expected more","I bought this album due to all the reviews that I read here, and I gotta tell you that this album is good, but not that good. I thought that it was going to listen to some brutal riffs and vocals, but I was mistaken.Don't get me wrong, this is a great album but it's no match for ""Slaughter of the Soul"".My favourites songs are ""Raped by The Light of Christ"" (what a romantic name!) and ""The architects"".Buy it, you won't regret it, but don't expect something like ""S.O.T.S."""
1,Kul-Want should stick to art history,"This is an ""introduction"" to Kant only for people who find Kant himself too accessible. The author doesn't understand Kant, and after reading this, neither will you."
1,Christopher Want left me want-ing,"Normally I love the ""Introducing . . ."" series. They are typically cleverly written, light-hearted and effectively communicate complicated ideas in interesting ways.This was not a good example.This book was so full of jargon that only a student of latin and/or philosophy would be able to understand it. The author and his editor has missed the point of these books - to demystify philosophy, not to continue to shroud it in terminology.Steer clear of this book and try ""Philosophy the Basics"" by Nigel Warburton for a very lucid introduction to the basic questions of: Why are we here? How did we get here? Is there a God? How should we act toward each other?"
1,Terrible,I was hoping for a book that could explain in simple terms some of Kant thoughts. This book is not that.
3,bits and pieces,"I rarely have an opportunity to show everything I know about genius as it relates to death. In Introducing Kant, genius and death happen to show up on the same page. These are very small pages. With such lengthy ideas in a format that cuts thinking like whatever Kant thought is always already absent for most people, I will merely report on a small dose:Genius represents that which isalways already absent (""the object"").This applies both to ""ideas ofinvisible beings, the realm of theblessed, the realm of hell, eternity,creation"", as well as to ""death,envy, and all the other vices, aswell as love, fame, and so on."" (p. 132)."
5,Great replacements to my stock rubber ones,"1998 Mustang.My stock rubber isolators had fallen apart. Got these new ones and put them in, slightly higher ride height (Which I needed), and the rear end feels a bit more connected and stable over the bumps. Installation was simple, jacked up the car, jacked up the control arm, disconnected the strut from the top (via bolt in the trunk) carefully lowered the control arm until the spring was loose. Pop out spring, place new isolators in place of the old, line up the spring, jack up the control arm and resecure the strut."
2,"If you really want ""weightless"", Don't try this","Waste of money.If you like to have cranbery tea, it is good product. For weight loss? please don't buy it. I have used for months but gain weight about 20lb by far. Of course weight loss is associated with many different factors but it NEVER decreases your appetite, burns fat, nor increases metabolism. I did exercise at least 30 minutes twice a week and have moderate levels of physical laber - but never worked!! Maybe it is just me but you'd better try some other products."
5,Haven't received it yet.,"I just ordered this book. The lady, who appeared on Simply Quilts, is positively charming. What a wit! Love her outlook on life and things swimming and hopping."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this movie. The story lacked depth even though it covered an interesting topic.Gail O'Grady's acting was as superb as ever, but the real disappointment was Mary McDonnell's contribution to the movie. Her acting really let the movie down.Perhaps if another actor was used to play Mary McDonnell's part, the movie would have been better."
3,Review of Health Law: Cases and Materials,"This book offers a comprehensive review of various issues in Health Law. It covers topics ranging from ERISA to Stem Cell Research. The authors did a great job researching each topic but did not really organize the information efficiently. They could have done a better job of using more extensive and topic organized notes sections after cases to explain complex issues like ERISA preemption or embryo parental rights. As a result, many times I felt the cases were compiled without really allowing the reader to understand the significance of each case with respect to the topic at hand."
5,Alpha Centauri is outstanding,"As a big fan of Civilization 2, I had high expectations of Alpha Centauri. It definitely doesn't disappoint. The overall structure and gameplay are similar to Civ 2, making it fairly easy to learn, but the details set it apart. Units and technology advancements are very unique. The 7 factions you can choose from have strong personalities of their own, and solid AI. If you enjoy Civ 2, this game is a great step forward. One negative is that it's too addicting!"
5,Alpha Centauri: another masterpiece from Sid Meier,"Alpha Centauri is a great game, like Civ II. Fighting Mind Worms, The Isle of the Deep, and The Locusts of Chiron is great, and customizing units in the workshop is awesome. All in all, A.C. is a great game, like its predecessers."
4,Dr. Laura: The Unauthorized Biography,"Great read! I found the information in this book to be fairly presented and without the snide comments the subject is famous for. Very interesting that ""the most famous mother in America"" was working after her child was born, verified by college pay registers listed in the appendix. Also interesting that she (1 had affairs with a married men(Bill Balance, Lew Bishop); 2) cohabited prior to marriage with Lew Bishop; 3) was trying to get pregnant while not yet married to Bishop; 4) Bishop was a dead-beat dad who had to be taken to court by his ex-wife to support his then 16-year old child. Puhleese! Although I don't dislike Dr. Laura entirely, I find her obnoxious when she tries to sound like a prophet from the Old Testament. This book captures the real Dr. Laura."
1,Cha-ching,"That's the sound the author of this book was looking for. Popular subject written in the true muck-raking tradition of the tabloids -- so we stretch the truth a little and reach a little to find the negative and quickly gloss over the positive and smile while all of Dr. Laura's ""targets"" scramble to make themselves feel superior by reading this ""great revelation"". All of these other ""reviewers"", such mean hearts. No wonder they found this ""entertaining"" and ""true"". Lots of people who are good people have made bad life decisions or haven't had the best advantages. Making pronouncement about a person or their life, someone you've never actually met or had a chance to get to know, is shameful. Where's the bio on this journalistic wonder?? I'll bet her ""true personality"" makes a pretty dishy read, too."
1,What Is Author Trying to Prove?,"I think all the author wanted to do was to try and discredit Dr. Laura in the eyes of the public. I say ""He who is without sin cast the first stone"". Whatever Dr. Laura has done in her past, is that--and the good that she presently does far outweighs the past. People CAN have remorse too!! Give her a break! I ended up glossing over the last part as I got tired of the author bashing her which was what the whole book was about. Glad I didn't buy it but got from the library."
1,Not Funny Enough,Plays it too straight. With the wealth of material this would have been a gas as a burlesque. What a pity.
4,Informative and Rather Entertaining Biography of a Sociopath,"I enjoyed this book for giving the history of Dr. Laura which she of course never references while telling others that they are wrong for the mistakes they make. Dr. Laura made the same ""mistakes"" or were they ""on-purposes""? Having her tubal ligation reversed in order to become pregnant by a married man was an extremely manipulative act. And it seems that Dr. Laura has remained manipulative, not to mention sadistic, to the present time. What she did to Dr. Barbara DeAngelis (having the nerve to claim that her psychology degree was bogus, when Dr. Laura's OWN degree is in physiology, NOT psychology) is downright bizarre, yet she got away with it. Her audiences must consist only of masochistic idiots who believe that they deserve to be called stupid by a woman who doesn't practice what she preaches. Scary that there are so many morons out there trusting in a woman pretending to be something she's not."
2,Really very boring...,"I have always been facinated with Dr. Laura, agreeing with some of what she says, disagreeing with much of it. But I found this book very dull, especially after listening to her program regularly. Dr. Laura does a great job of shocking the audience with her agressive advise and humiliation of her callers, but this book was just plain dull and unenlightening. It took very little information, expanded on it to the point of frustration and rambled on and on and on. My recommendation is not to bother with this book, it was a poor attempt to capitalize on the Dr. Laura Phenomenon, and I don't even like the lady!"
5,Revealing,"The writing is tortured and clunky, this is true, but it's a great book nonetheless. This woman comes across as pure evil. I could barely finish the book because I hated her so much by the end. It is just too bad that her message contains so much common sense. We need to keep the message and lose the messenger!"
4,Suggestions,"This book was very very good. I couldn't put it down. Since I have admired Dr. Laura for a long time, it was a big surprise. Everything in this book is either from magazines, or freinds and colleagues from her past. I would recomend this book to anyone friend or not. But, If you are seriously thinking about buying this book, then I'd recommend that you get one of her authorized biographys so that you may get both sides of the story."
3,missed a lot of material,"In my opinion, the best way to form an opinion of Dr. Laura's character is to listen to her show. And I have listened to her show and found her to be intelligent, insightful, and concerned for children, but often cruel and unwilling to control her temper as any decent adult should. Therefore, I think Bane describes Dr. Laura accurately.The problem with Bane's book is that she rarely discusses the content and emotional tone of Dr. Laura's show. (Sometimes the content of Dr. Laura's message is excellent, but her tone of voice makes me think she is a shrilly shrieking demagogue. Other times Dr. Laura sounds eminently sensible and reasonable.) This material is more revealing than negative comments from friends who are willing to dish the dirt."
1,Bad workmanship,"The worst quality I have seen in a bike. Also, the belt delaminated (broke) in less than 1 year and no parts are available. Keep replacement parts in mind when you buy any piece of exercise equipment."
2,You'll make up the price in belts.,This bike isn't very espensive and it's worth the money for the first year. The problem is the belt shreds about once a year. My wife and I put average wear and tear at best. It's hard to order the replacement belt because you have to call the company (can't buy it from the website). You have to buy the whole kit instead of just the belt (I don't need any more pulleys). Then you have to completely take apart the bike to put it on. I'm on my 4th belt and the seat is falling apart so maybe it's time to dump it.
4,great book for basic concepts on psionics in ad&d.,this book is still a great way for players to get a basic grasp of the psionic powers. though rules have changed it is much easier to understand than the way of the psionisist enclosure found in 2nd dark sun.
3,Bad and Good at the Same Time,"When I saw it originally on Animal Planet, I really wanted to see it but I had plans that night so I recorded it. Most movies that I record, I keep it as a movie if I liked it. I recorded over it. It wasn't that good. It some good parts in it but not many. The plot was good but little things that were added in, just down-sized it. I thought it would be awesome but maybe that's because I own an English Springer Spaniel named Hershey. Just do yourself a favor, keep your money and buy or rent a better movie!"
2,Very Good delivery - Poor Communication,"Prior to purchase, Seller did not reply until I started a complaint resolution with Amazon. The 2nd time I tried to communicate, AFTER I purchased the DVD, I asked a question and was told it was already sold. (to me!) Seller did not click that it was I who had purchased the dvd. She never replied to my question other than this.Item was well packaged and delivery was relatively fast."
5,Super!,This is an excellent book with great stories in it. My six year old really liked the variety of the stories. The length of the stories are just right for their age. It really made my son feel important to have a book just about his age!
2,book review,"I was a little disappointed because I assumed the stories would be accompanied by full color pictures, but there are very few and only in black and white. It will be used as a bedtime ""audio"" story instead. Stories/poems themselves are entertaining."
2,Disappointing,"A very disappointing book. I'd hoped for a solid, evenhanded treatment of the experiences of the Vietnam Veteran's Movement and the important struggle for better treatment from the VA and other government agencies. Instead, the book leans heavily leftward and resorts in many instances to almost childish caricatures (Henry Kissinger has an ""...elitist, smirky Harvard smile...""; government agents are ""...FBI guard dogs..."") and inconsistencies. In another case a veteran is described as having been ""...awarded the Navy Cross..."" when other published accounts do not list him as a recipient. All in all, too much agenda and not enough objectivity."
4,Useful history of the Veteran's Movement,"This book offers a comprehensive view of the veterans movement, giving very detailed accounts of the forces that helped swing public opinion, force acceptance of PTSD, and began the investigation into the effects of agent orange. While some of the events are detailed far beyond their impact, this book presents a human face on the leaders of the movement."
2,consiring to commit assassinations,"I am one of the Vietnam veterans referred to on page 217, the ones that didn't agree with anything the VVAW had to say.Someone wrote in their revue "" the myth of civilian disrespect to the soldiers during this period of time"", I would have to say it felt quite real to me. The only reason I checked this book out of my local library was to confirm a couple of things about John Kerry and the VVAW. All my questions were answered either by the book or by a recent interview with Gerald Nicosia. The first was that the other members of VVAW felt that John Kerry was just using the organization to gain public notoriety to help him with his political career. The second was that he was at the november 1971 meeting. This is when the anti war VVAW considered assassination of pro war Senators. Simply amazing!"
1,This stuff tastes terrible,"I am coffee lover, regular and decaf. When I read the description of this nasty, horrible tasting stuff, I thought I would try it instead of decaf coffee because of the potassium in it. First of all, it is very expensive for what you get. Tiny cans that are only about half full when you open them. Then the smell is very unpleasant and overpowering. It made me think this wasn't going to be a good choice but I brewed a pot anyway. It was so bad that after one cup I poured the rest down the drain. It is bitter, it has a ""grain like flavor"" kind of like chewing on unsweetened Metamucil powder, and it has a terrible aftertaste that lingers long after you finish drinking it. I don't know what I am going to do with the rest of it and it means about $30.00 down the drain or in the trash. This was a very expensive mistake on my part. Take heed!"
1,teeccino Almond Amaretto,"It was recommended by a friend, tried it, loved it, added one tablespoon to my regular decaf coffee blend. Placed an order and received it promptly and will order again when this case gets close to the bottom! Might try the other Teeccino flavors when I get tired of this one."
1,Horrible,"If you love coffee, this is not for you. The only similarity between this product and coffee is the color. I couldn't even finish my cup. Imagine grabbing a handful of mulch from your flowerbed, steeping it in hot water, and straining it into a cup. That's what this reminds me of. If you put cream and sugar in your coffee, then you really don't like the taste of coffee anyway, so this might be for you. I'm sure if you threw cream and sugar in this, it might be good."
3,Love - 'Electrically Speaking' (Yeaah!/Almafame),"Really good live recording of Love mainman Arthur Lee and back-up band performing in a small club in Santa Monica, CA in fall, 1991. Believe that Lee himself may've recorded this gig. Tracks I liked the best were ""My Little Red Book"", ""7 And 7 Is"" (has been covered by many other bands), the blues rocking ""Signed DC"" and the beautifully arranged ""She Comes In Colours"". Lee plays the Leaves standard ""Hey, Joe"" and a Hendrix cover ""Little Wing"". There's also a four (4) song live set that took place a year later that's been tagged on. ""Everlasting First"" is a tune that Lee co-wrote with Hendrix. Beat that. Rhino has reissued Love's 1967 'Forever Changes' lp (see my review) with some rather happening bonus cuts. Check it out."
5,Lovely,"The Duke is on his way to see about his only Heir (His brother's son) because his sister in law as written a desperate letter indicating the poor lad is on his death bed.The duke is injured in an attempted murder and is left for dead. He stumbles upon a house but collapses before he is able to tell anyone who he is.Bella's little brother alerts his sister and together they bring the stranger in and Bella nurses him back to Health till they can find out his true identity.Unfortunately for Bella, in a matchmaking plot gone wrong by her cousin, she finds herself suddenly alone overnight with the Duke and is forced to marry him to save her reputation.If this was the only plot to the novel, because it was well developed it would have been quite enough for me, but Ms Woodward delighted us in adding a twist to her tale.This is another recommendation due a 10 star rating.Lovely Lovely read."
4,you can ignore the introduction,"I was prepared to be very disappointed after reading the introduction - it was such flowery propaganda and personality cult-worship of the translator that I thought it must be compensating for a truly bad translation. This was not the case. The text I found to be warm, readable, and understandable and I consult the text often, though not the introduction which I have found easy to ignore. CCS"
5,"Refreshingly original, preagmatic and help-full","""In my role, I read many, many books on leadership each year. Very rarely do I come across one such as Debra Amidon's 'Innovation Strategies for the Knowledge Economy'. It is clear, refreshingly original, pragmatic, and help-full. It is clearly written by someone who has been in senior leadership, (vs. an observer/consultant). Although it can be read quickly, it can also be re-read regularly to reveal more depth and wisdom each time. Well done!"" Doug Macnamara - Vice President, The Banff Centre & General Manager, The Banff Centre for Management."
5,knowledge innovation - inside !,This book makes a compelling case for knowledge innovation as a vital strategic imperative for the awakening global knowledge-based economy.
1,"Random, incoherent compilation of myriad of opinions on KM","I am truly mystyfied how this book could get 5 stars from almost all readers. There is no method to it. It is just a collection of random statements praising the importance of knowledge management (frequently also author's company). While most of the opinions cited in this book are undoubtedly true, almost nothing of practical significance follows."
4,Good Starting Point,"This was probably the best guide to bars I have seen for Los Angeles. The writing is witty and the choice of bars is great. My only complaint is the layout. It would be cleaner to list the bars in the appendix by area and attractions, rather than just one big list. If you live in L.A., this is a great book to own, if you want to discover a few new places."
4,"if you like andy rooney, you'll like this book","For those who haven't seen Andy Rooney's essays on the TV show 60 minutes, this book may or may not prompt you to tune in more. If The text is simply a collection of Andy's columns about life. There is something about his simple style of writing- he is famous for striking a 'universal cord' in us all- that draws you into the book. Some may find it boring- the author tends to repeat himself here and there- but this is nonetheless a great book, not only witty, but interesting as well."
5,super great record!,"boy it sure is refreshing to hear an independent artist of this caliber.if you are a fan of vai,satch,eric johnson,this album will not disappoint!the compositions are great,and the guitar playing will blow you away.the recording sounds like a major label release!this guy is going places.i can't wait for the follow up."
1,not so positive,A buddy purchased this for me . Whatever the artist was trying to convey was lost on me. Sorry but it just sounded like he was showing off. Im sure he's a fine musican when supplied with quality material.
1,Not one good grommet from the kit,"Don't know if it was the flaring tool or the base, but one of them was off spec and as a result, the kit did not produce one, acceptable grommet. We were going into very light fiberglass window screen fabric, so it's not like we were asking the kit to go through leather or something really thick. Can only conclude kit was poorly made by Stanley. Better choice is the Lord & Hodge Handi-Grommet Repair Kits LHK2 2 Brass 3/8. It's available on Amazon and in other sizes as well. Punch and base are much better made and are far easier to handle, as the tools are larger in the hand."
4,Easy to use,This kit was so easy to use! I bought it to use for a school project my daughter was doing and we got everything done in no time! Perfect size kit for our needs.
5,great movie,i like ted roberts movies and i gave it a 5 on stars.he is a great star and soon will be a big name srar
2,Amateurish and pointles,"Talk about inane. It looks like it is the first time they have held a camera. Too many dumb mistakes to count (not subtle things like a microphone in frame for a sec. Instead you will see part of a film light and an extension cord for like 3 minutes. And it's not done intentionally, either). The story is obvious, the dialogue is hokey, the symbolism is obvious and trite, and once you get past the fact that there is incest going on, the whole thing is sort of inane. If you think that one shocking premise will keep you entertained for the whole film, enjoy. Otherwise get something with more substance."
1,Sick,"This is a sick, boring, and vile film. It's not erotic, and it is shot in someones apartment in Italy. Don't waste your time."
3,Good as far as it goes,"This investigation into the fate of Cleopatra's palace and library is a wonderful introduction to the topic. Since it was produced, however, the Egyptian government has constructed a remarkable new library near the site of the two thousand year old underwater ruins of the original. This film would could use an upgrade to include this new construction, added to the overall topic of her capital city, her palace and library, and their collective fates. This film is very good as far as it goes, nevertheless."
3,They're CDRs....,"I cant tell you anything you dont already know about CDRs. These are fine and I never buy white label for my data.**update**It seems that people want more from a review on CDRs. I have never burned a coaster with these on any drive I have on any PC I own, Windows nor OSX. That's about all that can be said for any brand of non-printable, non-lightscribe discs. They sound fine for audio as well, just be sure to burn at no more than 12x, but that's true for any brand. You're likely to have more issues with your burner than these discs. I guess I could rate them higher, but ""It's Okay"" fits the bill perfectly. I don't get the non-helpful ratings. They're just CDRs."
1,PRODISC EQUALS PROTRASH,"THESE MAXELL DISKS ARE PRODICS AND MOST OF THEM BURNED AS COASTERS. HARDDRIVE IS DEFRAGGED AND EVERYTHING SO NO ROOMFOR ERROR, OTHER CDS BURN PERFECTLY, THESE ARE A BAD BATCH OF PRODISCS THAT MAXELL IS SELLING, MAXELL HAS LET ME DOWN, THEY USED TO BE THE BEST :(ON A PLUS SIDE I HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN BURNING THESE DISC'S AT 8X THEY BURN FLAWLESSLY, SO I GUESS ITS A TRADEOFF FOR THE PRICE."
2,Disappointing results,"My water garden ""greened up"" badly -- looked like pea soup. I used Tetra Algae Control as indicated for three treatments three days apart and the water is as cloudy green as ever. I gave it two stars since this has been an usually hot summer and the lily pads are dying back prematurely. Plus the fish are unharmed by the product. Perhaps in a ""normal"" year, this might have worked. But it certainly didn't this year."
5,Great product,I have two of these in tandem. Works great over 3 floors to 2 TVs. Only running 1024 res but does handle much higher resolutions. Video looks good too.
1,Ordinary...,"is the best way I can describe this book. The characters are nothing special and their problems are far from engrossing. I didn't believe any of it and honestly didn't care. I found myself laughing at the ridiculous situations, language and overly dramatic writing in this book. This might be the worst romance I have read."
3,I liked the cover,"This book did excite me, in fact I read half of it in one morning, however it dragged at the end. Situations and people just became too predictable as if fashioned from a cookie cutter. It was obvious how the ending was going to be and I skipped paragraphs just to finish it. It wasn't a gripping page turner, which disappointed me because I felt it was a little in the beginning. If the ending had just been better, and Jonathan not the standard perfect little orphan boy, and Brace not the predictable over-obsessed villain, I would have enjoyed it more."
3,Not O'Banyons best effort.,"CO'B is a wonderful author. Perhaps she's written so many outstanding bks that my expectations are higher. I read this in 2 days....liked the characters ( our male lead is a bit of a hard ass and our female lead predictable); 2nd-ary characters are likeable....and the plot is fairly standard (with the exception of the bounty hunter being independently wealthy.)But I don't see it on my keeper shelf as a re-read and when I recommend a book to a friend, there are too many great ones before this one. sorry..."
1,Agree with Joke,"This is not a well written book. It constantly surprises me when books this bad get good reviews. I used to rely on the reviews on Amazon--I am beginning to wonder if authors are having all their friends write reviews.....I love romance books, but this book is very weak."
1,Hardly scientific,"This is an autobiography parading as research. The author has had a particularly difficult childhood with not one, but two divorces plus the suicide of a step-parent and she makes no attempt to be objective in her analysis.Her own personal tragedies so colour her perceptions that its hard to describe this as a study at all."
4,Need a plumber to install,"This product works great. My only problem was that it was not as easy as stated to install, much bigger than I thought. I needed a plumber to rework my pipes to install it. I will be changing the filter soon and will find out if that is as easy as stated. My plumber said it should be."
4,CGI Filmmaking: The Creation of Ghost Warrior,"Excellent book. It is very well written and has a lot of very useful information. Although at times Mr. Albee gets a little heavy handed with his philosophies or life and art, in general his advice is most welcome.I especially recommend this book to people who are just starting in the business, or are looking for a break in."
1,Grizzly Combo Sander,"Bought one of these directly from Grizzly just under 2 years ago. I used it intermittantly to sand the edges off bases of polyurethane plastic model kits. Other than being very noisy when turned on, it seemed to work quite well. Fast-forward to a week ago, went to turn it on & the motor barely turned the belt/disc & then it started to smoke. Called Grizzly customer service & told them the situation. They said it sounds like the motor burned out & they could send me a replacement motor for the unit, at my expense ($81 + shipping - another $20). An entire new combo sander is $125, so I pitched the unit in the garbage & ordered a Wen combo sander through Amazon, couldn't be much worse than the Grizzly I had. Bottom line: my first & last Grizzly purchase. I realize I didn't purchase a top-of-the-line sander, but I did expect it would last a little longer than it did."
1,Needs Bearings Not Bushings,"I originally bought these for my company for an industrial purpose. after a short time of use (approx. 1-2 months) the brass bushings in the front idler pulley wore out. The company discarded the machine to me. I got replacement parts still under warranted and put it back together. I used it in my home shop for approximately 30 -40 machine hours and the bushings wore out. what a disappointment. I am looking at another unit, the Grizzly H7761 Combo 2"" Belt Sander 6"" Disc Sander. This has ball bearings in all the moving parts. Grizzly tools can be of good value if you get the right unit."
3,It's OK but beware. . .,"I've purchased other Grizzly products and have enjoyed high quality products at a competitive price. While I will be able to make the g0547 work for my immediate needs, it was a bit disappointing considering it is a Grizzly.Beware: the table is made of aluminum and fairly junky. I've found it difficult to keep it square to the disk. The miter gauge too is really crappy, something of the modern Sears/Craftsman type of quality, not pro or pro-sumer quality. Also the trough for the miter gauge is too narrow to replace with an aftermarket miter gauge. It is not milled to the standard width.Would I buy another Grizzly product? Definitely. Would I buy this particular product again. Probably not."
1,bad assembly poor manufactoring,too hard to change belts....nopower machine work not good at all table rubs on sanding disc not to happy with pudrchase
3,"Lots of technology, poor writing","The book covers many aspects of XML on Windows platforms (.NET and MSXML). However, the writing is not very skillful, making it difficult to wade through such technical material. The progression through a topic often is non-linear: Within a chapter points are used before being introduced forcing much re-reading. Many times there are forward references to topics discussed much later in the book without any explaination. There are much more readable books out there (such as the excellent O'Reilly series) that make learning this kind of technology much more fun."
2,Not even remotely decipherable to a beginner,"This book reads like a medical journal, point-by-point layout out the facts and presenting very narrow-minded interpretations of what ASP.NET and XML are designed to do. For one thing, the authors exude an opinion in their writing that ASP.NET is useless without XML, and that XML is the greatest thing to come along since the transistor. I disagree with the sentiments, but that's beside the point. This book doesn't accomplish anything in the end but to confuse the reader. It's as if the authors are trying to impress you with how many acronyms they can spit out in a single page (I counted over 30 on one particular page). This is not writing, this is not teaching, it is shooting facts at the reader with a shotgun.In retrospect, I read this book a year ago when I was new to ASP.NET (but not to XML). I find it useful for storing read-only data in XML to be used in ASP.NET web sites. However, it's still one of the dryest books you will ever find."
1,An exercise in frustration,"More about XML than ""XML and ASP.NET."" I have already read a lot on XML and this book just confused me about what I already knew. It is full of definitions that don't really define anything and is lacking in good examples. I have read many, many books on programming and on the .Net framework specifically and this is by far one of the worst. After I know XML well I am sure that I will come back to this book and understand it completely. I am very sorry that I wasted my money on this book."
1,Highly ineffective,"This book is highly innefective for it's desired purpose. I had been under the assumption from the title that this book would help me implement XML databases/datastores into my C# site. My intentions ranged from reading user names and passwords from XML files for authentication, to transforming entire XML pages into XHTML with C#. If you have any of the same desires, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.In addition to being horribly written, convoluted, and cryptic, the book is not ""written with VB and C# examples."" Some code is VB and some is C#, yes, but nothing is written for both. For example, one section I wanted to implement was written in VB. Period. No C# alternative, not even a mention of C#. Move on, next topic. I was stuck trying to convert their (poorly written) VB to C#. That shouldn't happen. This book is terrible."
5,Great Classic,Wonderful Classic even if it is in VHS! Some of us still have those! Great color and story!This is one of Disneys and Mickeys best stories
2,"A good adapter, works well",This works well with both plastic (which squirrels chew holes into) and glass bottles. Building a suspension for glass bottles out of aluminum clothes-line solves the squirrel problem.
1,A Movie to Avoid,"It's so rare that I give a movie a one star review, but this was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen... little needs to be said about it except that basically every one of the jokes is recycled from old Little Johnny jokes, so if you've heard them, you've seen the movie, the animation is awful, looks as if it was made in the '70s, and the plot is barely there.I try not to be a cynic, but when you watch a movie without a fraction of originality, it's hard not to be. Even the attempts at being ""offensively funny"" with the minorities portrayed fall so flat on their face that you can't even feel offended.If you have never heard a joke in your life, then this may give you a laugh or two... other than that, this movie is impossible to recommend on any level."
4,New class of fan - new life-style,Having a remote control and a timer for a fan are the two features that qualify this as a 'new class' of product for me. Having the timer shut the fan is very nice. Wish it would remember the previous timer setting and automatically shutoff. You have to set the timer each time you turn it on.Quiet - but... makes crickety noise in oscillate + wind mode. I bought two units and both behaved the same - so it is a design thing.Overall - reasonable value. I'm happy I got two.
3,Not so quiet after 3 months-SAVE THE PACKING SLIP for repair,"A nice fan which is almost soundless when you first get it. I loved how I could leave it on at night in the bedroom and sleep without all that fan noise. However, after a few months, this fan develops a loud squeak which just won't go away. It's warranteed for years and Bionnaire is happy to replace the fan provided you have the ORIGINAL PACKING SLIP. It doesn't matter if you have a receipt from Amazon or can provide documentation from the credit card company. Without the packing slip you're out of luck. I'm going to give this product one more try because of it's initial quietness."
5,"Great, quiet fan!","This fan has far exceeded my expectations-it's super-quiet, easy to move around, and has numerous handy features. I've had it about a year-no problems. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fan that works well."
3,"Not Bat, But...","Worked OK, bu after two years just refused to start up at the beginning of the warm season."
2,Poor quality; not worth the money,I have purchased three of these fans. Two were purchased about two years ago and worked fine until recently when one had problems with oscillation (sounds like a broken piece of plastic inside but it still oscillates with hesitation at both ends of the cycle). The most recent purchase from Amazon a month or so ago was a bad experience. The fan vibrated significantly and made annoying clicking sounds throughout the oscillation cycle. I sent it back and Amazon promptly sent me another fan as requested. The second fan also vibrated significantly but did not make the cicking sound --- at first. Now it does. The new fan is also much noisier than the previous purchased fans. All are the same model (BT45RC) and all were purchased from Amazon. Considering the steep price and poor quality I would recommend looking elsewhere.
2,"There's no hatchet job, mine squeaks and stopped runing too!","I have never wrote a review, but was compelled to do so because of people thinking that the negative reviews were lies. I think one of the causes of the squeaking and fan refusing to twirl is if the slightest bit of dust accumilates on the blades, it creates an imbalance and squeaking and stops the fan from being able to twirl. I took the fan apart and cleaned all the blades and the problems stopped for about 6 months and I never open my windows so there isn't that much dust in my house. Now it has started again and I only use it at night and during the summer months. Most people would not take the fan apart. It is very tedious and time consuming! It's obvious there is a engineering flaw of some kind, all the complaints are exactly the same.The problem is I haven't found a fan that is as quiet as this one and doesn't take up much room. So I do plan on getting another one save the reciepts and if the problem starts again keep returning it."
1,It Just Looks Pretty,"The only reason why I like this fan is because it is attractive, and it makes a good conversation piece in the living room or office, but its performance is the worse. After a month, my fan began to make the most god-awful squeaking noise. After pulling it out for this upcoming summer, it has a slow start. I find this to be a darn shame for a fan that is between the price range of $30-$80. I went to an hardware store not long ago and saw that another company has come out with a high velocity model of this fan. I was very impressed by that new and improved version and intend on replacing my current tower fan with it."
1,ITS JUNK,"Was given fan for my new office. Had it running off and on for 2 days and doesnt work !!!! Looks great, 2 days worth and nothing !! Dont buy this piece of junk.....There wasn't any ""0"" stars or I would have rated it just that.. I dont have the packing slip since it was a gift. So I guess I have to toss it in the garbage... I will NEVER buy a Bionaire product ever !!!"
1,I I should have listened...,"The reviews on this fan were mixed. But I took a chance on buying one because of it's features, a 5 year warranty and it's seeming better quality. I should have listened and taken to heart what other reviewers said. One of the selling features of this fan was that it was supposed to be really quiet. It wasn't. Several other buyers complained that it made a chipping noise. Mine did on high from the moment I plugged it in. My biggest mistake was choosing a tower fan. Because of where I wanted to use it, a tower fan would work best. I should have gone to a local store that sold tower fans and tried one out. I would have immediately discovered that it didn't move much air. I was used to box and stand fans that had real power. Even this high priced tower fan did not. It was a joke. I found a great stand fan with a remote that is super quiet with great power for $10 less. If you want a fan that really cools, keep looking. Unhappy in LA."
4,Great fan - quiet and does the job,"I'm very happy with the product. I had a Lasko Control Tower Fan and in was noisey and would make screetching sounds now and then. It died after a few years. This one is great - however they sent the wrong size screws to mount the base. They were too short, so crazy glue came to the rescue!"
2,Didnt last long,"I have had this fan 14 months and it just stopped working.No rhyme or reason, one day it just stopped. We opened it to see if there was any noticeable reason but all wires seemed fine. Up until then it worked great - quiet and circulated air well. I deliberately bought this model because it was more expensive and i wouldnt have to replace it all the time...oh well"
2,"Great at first, soon made horrible noises","I loved this fan when I first got it. Even on high, it was pretty quiet, and the features (oscillation, remote control, etc) were great. Unfortunately, after just a month of use, I noticed it started to get a lot louder on the highest setting. A week or two after that, it got unbearable to sleep with on the loudest setting, mostly because it was an inconsistent noise: sort of a cranking sound every 10 seconds. This probably has to do with oscillation, as it sounds better when it's not oscillating (but still louder than it should). My solution was to leave the fan on medium setting, but soon even that setting started to get loud. I checked the fan to make sure it wasn't dirty,any broken parts, etc, and everything looks normal. For it to go from quiet to strange, loud noises in the space of a month or two is unacceptable; I would not buy or recommend this product."
5,Excelent product,la entrega del producto fue excelente en el tiempo indicado y rápidolo use y funciona excelente no hay problema
3,Novice Reading,"My first Patricia Grasso novel. I was disappointed in many historical and language mistakes. And the fairy godmother speaking and being seen by others was a bit much to swallow. But then I believe that Ms. Grasso enjoys the magical and unbelievable. Obviously her favorite fairy tale was and still remains to be Cinderalla. But the novel had comical situations and the characters were enjoyable! I truly wish I could learn more about the Dowager and her absolutely 'nutty' sister. But the novel is an enjoyable novel for novice romance readers; no explicit sexual encounters, little if any violence, and of course, an unloved child finally finding love. It is a 'feel good' novel and yes, I did enjoy the novel and would read other Patricia Grasso novels."
2,Smells like cough syrup & tastes okay.,"Sure this tea has a mild fruity taste, but the cough syrup smell turns me off. I won't be buying it again."
5,Great product Best Tea,It's excellent. Wonderful tea flavor. The tea pyramids never lose their shape.
1,Catalogue Not Updated,"I placed an order for the Volkl BB10 2 weeks ago...NRC Sports called to inform me that the item isn't in stock. Meanwhile, I've wasted 2 weeks thinking the racket would be on it's way. They still have it listed as ""In Stock"". Not acceptable."
5,An extrordinary book,This book is the one of my favorites about how the a beautiful young girl meets her soulmate but cannot be with him because she is a mafia princess. I couldn't put the book done for a second.I recomend this book to everyone who is into romance novels.
4,Babies/Toddlers Respond Sweetly to These Books,"Both of my girls started loving these books (My Mom, My Dad) as early as 10 months and asked for them by name. They love the pictures of real people and the simple words. They seem to engender sweet feelings in them toward Mom and Dad as we read them. My youngest is almost 2 and she still asks for theses books."
3,Nice but It doesn't last,+:-Lovely smell-not overwhelming-calming-:-smell doesn't last-this would only work for someone who wants a quick light refreshed scent (this is not a room spray)Over:-love the scent and it fits my needs.
2,Expensive air freshener,"I purchased this to wear as a fragrance, but did not like it on me. It didn't stay on very long and I felt like I was using a room air freshener on myself. It is OK as a room air freshener, but for that alone it's too pricey."
3,Smells Lovely...,"...but doesn't last. I use it nightly on my pillows to help me relax and fall asleep. I also use it as a room spray, but the scent fades quickly."
1,Bad Batch?,"I purchased 2 of these. They both smell awful, nothing like lavender. They smell like a really bad men's deoderant. I have a feeling that I may have gotten them from an old, turned rancid batch. I will go to a store and make sure I smell before buying in the future. just a little surprised."
2,I don't see the big deal,smell is very faint and has not helped me sleep any better. maybe I need to get some oils to help.
5,Lavender Mist,"This is very nice lavender mist. I use it on my bed linens and it also, if misted on myself and my little dog, keeps insects away. The price was reasonable and I received it in good time.I enjoy shopping through Amazon."
3,Aura Cacia - Mist Lavender,This scent is OK but I wouldn't order again. It dissipates quickly. I'm trying to find a replacement for 'The HealingGarden's Lavender Therapy'calm and comfort and pillow/room spray or find something I like as much but this doesn't come close. I'll continue in my search and hopefully find something real pleasant and economical.
4,Breath of fresh aire,"Lavender has many subtle aromas. If you've ever stood on a hill in a field of it, you'd recognize it right away, even if blindfolded. So to with this. Close your eyes and stand in that field any time you want. Listen to your favorite soundtrack, for me that is the sound of summer field birds. I'm there and all the stress of my cancer treatment fades into obscurity. Need a break for it all? Try this escape facilitator. Two squirts is all it takes to stand on that hill of lavender again."
4,"Great spray, poor packaging",This is a wonderful lavender spray however when it arrived it had leaked a bit because the top was loose. I would definitely purchase again because for the price the spray is great but I'd hope that next time it would come in better packaging.
5,Tastes great and is good for you,This tea tastes great and is good for you. Cranberry tea is an excellent tool to help cleanse the lymphatic system as well. The fennel in this tea is a light and delicious addition and it mellows out the flavor of the cranberry.
5,Totally helps on retain water issues.,"I tend to bloat easily and have tried water pills in the past and absolutely hate them (rather bloat then take the pills). I came across this tea when I was buying the detox and smooth-move tea from the same brand. After the holiday bad food eating.....I put on an easy 10 lbs (5 of it probably water weight). I had to get some quick herbal help. Thanks to this tea, I feel great. Each time I take this tea along with the detox tea, I feel there is no water retention, at all. I can't live without this stuff (in the winter months only)....so I finally just ordered 6 boxes from Amazon because the local 'Target' store that carries this cranberry tea cannot keep it in stock. Around Valentines day I kept on going back to see if it was in stock and it surely wasn't. The last time I bought it, from Target, the girl behind the counter who rang me up....was telling me how she loved, loved, loved this weightless tea (I was like, 'I know, I know')."
5,Strong,This tea has a nice strong flavor and spicy flavor. It is very concentrated. They shipped it fast!! Very good to get rid of the extra water weight.
4,love it,Love this tea. Tge result is exactly what the advertisement states. If yoy suffer from water retention it us recommended.
5,"Sad, truthful, thought provoking...","Tom Shear is a true musical genius. His lyrics are powerful and moving, and the beats are un-paralleled. And the fact he wrote the album for his father makes it that much more intense. I would definately recommend this album to anyone with a more mature, intellecutal mind. The album goes from upbeat tracks like ""House on fire"" to more mellow, deeper tracks like ""King of Insects."" Definately worth buying.~Bill"
3,Hmmm.....,"after hearing from a few sources that this was a really good band i decided to check out their most popular album.. failure. and i have to admit i am ""disappointed"". while this is a decent techno/industrial album (so hard to label this kinda music now a days) i felt it could have been better. if you want a really good 1 man band in my opinion nine inch nails and velvet acid christ are the cream of the crop... tom shear ranks just ok in my book"
2,"More self-indulgent, masturbatory nonsense","The music is trite and two-dimensional, although it does occasionally ascend to very energetic sweeping crescendos. The lyrics endeavor to distill nothing universal from personal experience, but only wallow in an irritating mire of self-pity. Honestly, I don't really care about the guy's personal problems--and the album's worth is predicated on just such an assumption, that is, that someone, for whatever reason, does."
4,MUCH better than carrying home gallons...,"Are readymade gallons of tea from the supermarket better? Usually. But heavy to schlep home.Is homebrewed tea better? Yup! But too much work most of the time.But when you want it easy in the house, this isn't bad. Better than most Diet Tea mixes (other than those 'real tea' expensive kinds). I wouldn't say the Peach is a true flavor but good.I'm keeping this in stock, and also mixing it with the other flavors from Lipton. By the by, I really like their Diet Raspberry."
5,WARNING,Be warned: This stuff is highly addictive.You can't tell the difference between this and the sugar version.
4,A wonderful surprise,"I regularly use instant tea. I had never seen Lipton Tea as a Diet Instant Tea. Itrust the Lipton brand so, I bought this as a case.Lipton Instant Tea is more like tea than some of the other Peach Diet Instant teasI have tried. The flavor is more subtle, and it is not overly sweet. Of course youcan add more mix to enhance the flavor experience. All the others I have tried havetiny pre-measured tubs, that make two-quarts each.This has become my brand of choice for instant diet tea.If you follow the suggested measure, each jar of instant tea is good for 40 servings."
5,Best instant diet peach tea ever!,"I seriously hate how my local stores stop carrying one of my favorite items. This was one of them. Lipton's Diet Peach Tea is one of the best tastes I have ever had. I love ice tea, and sometimes the already mixed ones like Snapple can be a little bit more pricier. I mean it's not just a budget deal here, but the overall taste of it is just pure awesomeness. Their other flavors are just as well. However, this peach ice tea is just one of the best ever. Plus it's DIET! I'm so happy to have found this on Amazon. I was worried about the expiration date, however It's good until another year. I'll definitely purchase this again and highly recommend it."
5,Excellent Diet Peach Tea by Lipton,"Excellent flavor, quick dissolving. No after taste. I like being able to make this tea as strong as I want. Can't be found in any grocery stores any more in my area. Diet raspberry is also excellent."
4,"Love this tea, but tired of broken bottles!","I have odered this tea for about three years. I love the tea and what a great price. I am upset though, afer writing Amazon and telling them that two or three times my whole box was covered with tea, due to a broken bottle. I had to deal with glass and messy clean-ups. I told them that I thought I should recieve one free, for loss of tea and mess. It has been about one month and no word from them, however they now wrap each bottle seperatley! I can now say it is safe to order, and you won't be sorry ordering it. It is really great tea!!"
2,"Fun, yet lack of variety","The graphics in this game are stellar, dude! But that's all that's good in this half-baked game,dude. C dude, cuz when U start the game, U R treated with a TV- style introduction showing people fall in snow that takes about 10 minutes 2 load on a top-of-the-line computer,dude! Then, U R sent 2 the main menu, which consists of a bunch of options, dude! And when U play it, U get a chance 2 snowboard poorly, and it ain't your fault, because the games controls R mind-boggling and confusing,man! The manual does not help at all 2 help U understand this snowy mess off a PC game. So, dude, if your looking 4 a good snowboarding game, go buy a N64 and 1080. That's probably the only good snowboard game out there, man ."
3,"Great tv show, very poor game...","Graphics: 5, Gameplay: 4, Control: 1. Very very poor! Buy the Playstation version, not this!"
2,don't bother,"This game is horrible. The movies in between the missions are cool i guess, and their graphics are good, but the actual mission graphics are not good. it looks like one of those no-name company games. the car controls are useless. It is nearly impossible to control the car and make it go where you want it to. the game is rediculously short. i beat it in a day and a half and there were maybe three missions that i didn't beat on the first time. I expected a lot more from a major company-produced game that was advertised so much. Seriously, don't waste your money. if you want mission-based driving, buy Driver."
3,Wonder Woman Jazed Up!!!!!,"This single has a jazed up version of the Wonder Woman Theme. The theme used is from the New Adventures of Wonder Woman which ran on CBS. (second series) This is not a dance remix, if that is what you are lookig for. but it is worth checking out. The rest of the single is nice and mellow. The knid of music you would listen to on a rainy day. Three tracks total. A must for the Wonder Woman nut."
5,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!,"This has to be the best smelling AXE Product on the market. I am not sure why the company stopped selling this sent, IT has a great orange smell to it and it just amazing, you really must try this Product, even if it cost as much as 2 bottles it's still worth it!"
1,HTML disappointment!,"I'm disappointed in the condition this book came to me in, in a package that probably that wasn't made for this kind of shipment; The book came badly crinkled,stained(don't want to know what liquid this stain came from), pages were semi-sticky, basically came to me in very poor condition! And the label for this book was considered...""acceptable""???? I wonder what you would consider NOT! Especially for the $45+ that I paid for this book in the first place! If I paid maybe something around $5 or less, I might accept this book...like if I bought this book from a yard sale...or rummage type of sale..I would accept whatever condition said book was in, since I didn't pay almost anything for it in the second place. So, any future purchases are very ""iffy"" from this point on! Credibility is now gone!!"
1,Student Review,"If you were assigned this book for school like I was, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU! I have always liked coding HTML for myself and my friends, so when I got the opportunity to go to school for Web Design I was naturally excited. My first coding class was Beginning HTML, so I looked online to find the required textbook for the class. I was put off at first by the numerous bad reviews this book received but, as I didn't have any choice, I bought the book anyway...After six weeks of un-learning the proper W3C standards and wading through line, after line of confusing, disorganized code (working files that were provided), I had enough. Before reading this book, I could easily code a simple web site. Now, I am just confused. I have a 3.6 gpa, if that means anything, so it was not for lack of effort on my part!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! If it's for school then you should file a complaint with your school's Web Design department.Christian E."
4,A good beginning resource.,"The book was pretty easy to follow, and was good resource as far as learning the basics of HTML codes and programming for web pages."
2,Food Your Miracle Medicine,This book tries to cover so many topics that it only provides snippets on each subject. The typical topic is two paragraphs long and is mostly anecdotal.
2,Food-Your Miracle Medicine.,Your body and you control what goes in your mouth. Your choice how you take care of it. Your great grandparents were pretty smart. Lived a long time and the doctor was never around nor was he needed.
3,too technical get the food pharmacy,"I had the food pharmacy book and thought this would be good also. I got it for someone with cancer--someone that needed information but is already overextended in facts and figures.I was disappointed as it was nothing like ""food Pharmacy""--It is way too technical and bogs you down with pages of scientific fact and technical jargon. If your into that--you will love this book--If you are looking for quick nutritional information....buy the food pharmacy."
3,introsection for a winner turned loser,"What are the sins of a man that weight him downtoward death? There are real events that hang onour consciences? Here a fashion designer has to face his agonyof remorse and finds an unexpected result.The end of the movie leaves the conflict of the theme unresolved for me.The movie has great acting and is well written mostly, butsome of the elements are mysteries like why the rich friendgo back on his 12 million dollar promise.For a movie that deals with fate and motivation,the result is more artistic than constructive?"
1,Makes it worse,"After careful application of a small amount of bliss Sleeping Peel Liver Spot Lifter using a q-tip directly on to the liver spot; I awoke to find the area around the liver spot lighten and the liver spot remained unchanged. So now I have a light white circle highlighting my liver spot, making it appear darker. I paid $90 at a snooty San Francisco salon. Oh ya, the bottle top broke on the 4th use."
2,The Hunt for the Engineer : How Israeli Agents Tracked the H,"After reading the other reviews on this book, I was expecting a book bursting with riveting narrative and well-developed characters. I was greatly disappointed.The topic is inherently fascinating, but the redundant writing style was a continual distraction. Additionally, presentation of the relationship between the Israeli and Palestinian adversaries was shallow, and the terrorist bombings were presented with very little variation from one incident to the next.Overall, this was a disappointing read."
3,A Mix of Cliched Thriller and Mediocre Biography,"Although I read this book with some interest, I was constantly bothered by its poor writing, lapses into lame cliches and reliance on unnamed sources. It contains very little about the actual life of Ayyash, which I suppose is no surprise since he made such an effort to keep his life secret. Katz really likes painting vivid scenes of events he didn't witness, which I find a real shortcoming. I still don't regret reading it, however, as it has at least some info on Ayyash and his background that is interesting. I didn't find it particularly one-sided."
1,Unattributable sources and Interviews,"With no information on the author regarding his credentials (except to say that he is a ""expert on terrorism"") no bibliography, no index and lots of interviews and sources that are unattributable one is left wondering if this is made up journalism! Amatuerish and poorly written the book spends most of the time rehashing mideast history and little on the actual hunt. The subject matter is worth writing a book but I guess real sources were unavailable so a real book could not be written by a real credentialed author."
4,Hard to find book that was pretty new- little bit worn in the cover,This was a present for my brother. Not as perfect and new as I expected but arrived in time for Christmas which is always great. Thanks
1,An Israelli Propaganda Book,"This book was'nt what I imagined it to be. It's virtually pure propaganda of Israeli intelligence and their military services. Samuel Katz takes a one sided view here and mostly describes the Israeli population suffering due to the suicide bombers destruction. He virtually ignores the fact on why the Palestinians resort to this method and does not inform the readers how the Israeli's murder of innocent civillians started the whole issue. Samuel Katz should have explored both sides of the issue well before writing this book. Furthermore, those wanting to know of how Israeli agents tracked the bomber would be dissapointed as the book largely focuses on Israeli politics. A bad buy to anyone interested. I would recommend ""By Way Of Deception"" by Victor Ostrovsky and ""Gideon's Spies"" by Gordon Thomas for a compelling read."
4,The peace process and its enemies,"As some others have said, the title of this book might be a bit misleading. This book has much more about ""the hunt"" than it does about ""the engineer."" Even more broadly, this book is about the Israel politics in the 1990s, the attempts at peace, attempts by terrorist groups to thwart that peace and Israel's attempts to stop those terrorists. At times, Ayyash (the engineer) seems like a bit player in this narrative. There is very little biographical information available about Ayyash, so Katz makes do with what he has.I agree with another review who was concerned with Katz's overly vivid descriptions of events and scenes he didn't witness. I also found some of the bombing scene descriptions redundant and cliched.As a whole, however, this book is a good choice for those interested in modern Israeli affairs, terrorism and counter-terrorism and peace between Israel and the Palestinians."
1,Rated: Do Not Buy,"The motor for the juicer broke within seconds of being turned on for the first time. The juicer was not handled by me in any way that was rough that would cause the motor to break within seconds of the juicers first use. I started pushing an orange onto the juicer and there was a clicking or snapping sound in the motor. The motor did not turn on after that. I would not buy this product again. I would have given the juicer zero stars, but giving an item zero stars is not an option."
4,Works fine,"I bought this a few months ago to make lemonade and it has worked fine on a daily basis, we now make orange juice with it every morning too and it hasn't failed once.Sometimes we have to tap it a couple times to get it to actually go in the reverse direction but eventually it does and allows us to get more juice from the fruit.I wash it by hand and it cleans up easily.My only complaint about this unit is that it is VERY loud, and that's coming from someone with hearing loss, so I knocked off a star for that because it really is loud, too loud for my mornings.All in all I am glad I bought it and it has worked fine for months."
2,Won't buy this one again,"I purchased the Aroma ACJ-181 1-Liter Citrus Juicer since I have a wonderful tangerine tree in my backyard and wanted to use more of the fruit this year.At first the little juicer was doing an ok job then it started slowing down and reversing. The tray that keeps the seeds out of the juice didn't do it's job. ""I know that I won't be growing a tangerine tree in my stomach but it isn't fun to drink the seeds!""The photo shows a lid which appears to cover the juice but it isn't a tight seal and fridge odors could get into the juice, also spillage is possible.Over all I'll just pick the fruit from the tree and eat it instead of taking the trouble of using the juicer."
1,Out of date,"This will not work on OS 9.2 or later (OS 10.x), only on OS's before 9.2 where it is very good. According to Delorme it is not & will not be supported after OS 9.1."
1,Try Route USA by Route 66 for Mac,"Hi everyone,I have been looking for a travel program for my Mac and came up empty until I took the most obvious route and looked on the apple store webpage. They have a program called Route USA 2004 by Route 66. Looks like its a very good program that will work for most peoples needs. So there ya go, no more worries. Go to www.66.com"
1,Be careful what you buy!,"I bought this to run on my MacBook Pro and it will not work with Lion (10.7.2) Operating System. It was a total waste of money. I waited until it was too late to return it.I am stuck with an older product. Not being that proficient with MACs, I thought that this was the latest version for road maps for the MAC, but it will not even start to load. It simply says it is too old to be used with the operating system. I am very disappointed. I want a map program like Microsoft's ""Streets and Trips"" for a PC which I just bought in Staple's for $14.95, but even they don't carry a map program for a MAC. This program should not have been be sold. It is an old product and not worth anything."
5,Great CD,"Unfortunately, I fist picked up this CD after Brand New Sin disbanded. What a great CD!!!!! At first I wasn't really sure if I liked the singers voice. It didn't take long at all to fall in love with it. This is just a foot stomping, fist pumping album! Buy it and put it in you car or truck for a week and you will be hooked."
4,Grudging,"In addition to the execrable sound, I always found this performance a bit rushed and lacking those subtle elements of emphasis which add grandeur to this work. Best are the scherzo and adagio, and some parts of the finale, though tempos here seems oddly inconsistent, though saved by the greatest coda in the recorded history of the ninth. While an extremely worthwhile rendition, not in the sublime class of Horenstein's Eroica."
4,A true Story,"This movie shows how a Man can fight for the truth, and how was Paraguay during this dictatorship of almost 40 years. Here U will see the corruption of this small country in South America, and the tirany that this man had, Alfredo Stroessner.Its a sad story and all the events happened in the real life. Today the Filartigas lives in Asuncion, the capital city. Always remenbering Joelito.In memory of all the people who died in this sad part of the Paraguayan history."
2,Sleep Inducing,This movie was extremely disappointing. I expected much better from Anthony Hopkins. We discontinued watching after approximately a half-hour of total boredom. A tedious movie and certainly not one I would recommend to others.
5,awesome speakers,"First of I would like to say hat thse speakers are extremely good. These speakers came with my computer and they werent that hard to hook up. Actually they were relatively easy to hook up. It took me about 3 minutes to hook them up. They have very good bass, and can playvery good mids. The only thing is thy cant play highsat all. They get didstorted alt. Actually i blew my fort pair up and had to buy another, but other than that thy really good."
1,A complete and total joke,"You can get a thousand (literally) times more in Regardie's ""The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic"". This charlatan should be strung up for this travesty of a book."
4,Pokemon Treecko costume,"This is a soft, cuddly costume, a bit young in theme for my 8-yr old, but he likes to use it as a pajama sleeper."
5,My son loves it!,We got this as a halloween costume and my son loves it! He wore it for halloween but also uses it to act out Pokemon. I was really impressed with the quality and think it will last a very long time.
4,"A great GPS, but Garmin is not maintaining their maps!","I have used the eMap on several driving trips along the east coast and found it easy to use and the base map fairly accurate. BUT, I purchased the Roads & Recreation CD-ROM and found that maps in the North Carolina region are over 5 years old. I contacted Garmin and they confirmed that no updates have been published and they have no policy regarding providing updates to the maps! While I like the functionality of downloading more detailed maps into the GPS, investing $100 in obsolete maps and a company who doesn't seem to view this as a problem bothers me."
4,eMap,"Purchased about 3 weeks ago and have used it alot. I liked the keys on the bottom of the unit, you can use them and see the screen at the same time. The detail is nice but it requires you to purchase an 8mg card and download an area's detail and then it will give a fairly detailed street level info for a given city or region. Forget trying to load more than one city or region at a time with the 8 mg card. City like Houston takes up the entire card's memory. Really like the automatic tracking feature, and its ""track back"" feature. The instruction book is not all that good, I have found some features are not very clearly explained in the material. But in all, for the price, and for my frequent road trips (200 -400 miles) is a nice tool. One other thing, the GPS comes really with nothing. Recommend the buyer also by the carring case, at least the 8mg card, PC cable (if you buy the softeare for detail downloads), and car battery charger."
5,A great GPS unit!,"had my e-Map for over a month now and really love it. good acuracy, fast positioning, and easy to use software. make sure to download the latest sw from the garmin web site. it's free and has useful new features not in the software shipped with the unit. one downside is the short battery life - only ~8 hours when in he normal mode but power saving mode extends battery life considerably. comes with a power cord that you can plug into a cigarett lighter socket so the short battery life is no problem when using it in the car or boat.bought the u.s. roads and recreation software and am extremely pleased with it. incredible detail and falling-off-a-log easy to upload maps from the cd into the e-map. don't waste your money on the worldmap cd, which has no where hear enough detail to be useful for anything."
3,Still not perfect,"I have been following the development of GPS systems over the last ten years and this is a powerful compact GPS that you can get accurate street level maps that are downloadable from your computer. You can plan routes look up addresses, and have difficulty getting lost with the right downloaded data. The display is hard to read while driving, and it many deseigned for a compact travel map. The larger version of this model has a readable screen, but not compact for carrying. When driving, the gps is sometimes off by 50 to a 100 feet, but that is common with most GPS. I would prefer a little more contrast in the screen for reading or a color screen that might be easier to read. Scrolling to the differenct screens is very easy and you can figure out the program in 5 minutes."
3,it is out-dated,"Too technical for me.It around late 90's and for lung transplants is out-dated.You can learn a lot about everything, medicine, operation, etc.."
1,Vials pop out of tray,"A great concept of protecting your insulin vials, but the plastic tray is awkward to use. My insulin vials kept popping out, or sometimes popped out so forcefully when I did try to remove them, that I ended up dropping them on the floor. They used to have a great case with durable elastic loops for your vials...the predecessor to this version. It was much better but I don't think they make it anymore."
3,to bulky,It only holds 2 needles and 2 vials of insulin. to big to carry for 2 uses. the Freeo is much better.
5,"If you like reverb, you'll dig this book!","Even an old hodad like me enjoyed this quirky tour de force. If you have a milk crate full of Ventures records sitting in your closet, or an old Silvertone under your bed, you'll definately appreciate the info in this book. The author does an admirable job handling the esoteric and eclectic topic of Surf Music History. If you're a gremmie, you'll need this book to know which LP's to put on your Salvation Army Store shopping list. Buy this one before it goes out of print forever! I mean it!"
3,Worthwhile but flawed,"The photos and raw information make this book worthwhile for fanatics of instrumental surf music, but the author's writing style is rather dull and far too repetitive."
1,locks up & crashes frequently,"I've installed this games on two different Linux machines I've got, one running Red Hat 6.0 and the other running SuSE 7.1, and on both of them I've had severe reliability problems with the game. Nearly every time I've started the game program up it has malfunctioned in some manner. I don't know if this game is really any fun or not because I don't feel like I've been able to play it at all. For me, this has been a complete waste of money. If I can get their support to give me a clue about how to fix it, then maybe my opinion will change."
1,too long,I so didn't like this book. It was like 300 pages too long. Adam and Liz weren't even together much so how could you even call it a romance. Basically it took the whole non communication thing that romances are famous for and extended it through the whole entire book!
1,A polemic AGAINST the separation of Church and State,"Having worked my way halfway through this book, I found NO legal citations, but MANY citations of Biblical ""proof texts.""This author shows NO consideration for people of other religious persuasions than his own, narrow, fundamentalist Christian views:* No consideration for atheists* No consideration for Buddhists, Muslims, Wiccans, or other non-Christian religions* A LITTLE consideration for Jews - but only as possible converts to Christianity.There are no references to the early history of the Constitution - of the founding of Rhode Island as a refuge from persecution by the Puritans of Massachusetts, or of the founding of Maryland as a refuge for Catholics, or of the founding of Pennsylvania as a refuge from persecution of Quakers by the Church of England.This is not a book tracing the historical or legal foundations for the First Amendment -- it is only polemic AGAINST the First Amendment."
3,It's GREEN not Blue as shown,"These dolphins are sooo cute!!However, the picture shown the mousepad is blue...but it's not, it's green (so are the dolphins)! I'd prefer the one that you actually see here, but didn't want to go thru the hassle of returning and waiting for another to arrive."
5,"True punk! Don't like it, **** off!","This is my favorite punk band, I'm glad there are still real punk bands around, I hate that poser punk crap(Blink 182, Green Day, and most things people call ""punk""), it is like a boy band with a guitar and drums. This is like they did one take of each song and don't care how it comes out(like true punks would), and it works. To those who like real punk, hate the government, like drinkin, drugs, or all of the above, this is your new band. They don't have any bad songs, they all kick a**! People who like poser punk(namely posers) will hate this band and give them bad reviews."
4,STAY OUT OF ORDER!!,"Vintage casualties! This is almost as good as ""for the punx"" I would highly reccomend buying this cd as soon as you can!"
1,another poser cd!!!!!,"Casualties?For pussies this band is no street punk band they are posers, all their songs are easily put together(anyone can write better songs), and they got a bunch of posers buying their cds, keep your money for something valuable(experiance the power of ska)"
4,Bigfoot(1994),"From the A&E; Ancient Mysteries Series comes this little gem of ""Bigfoot."" The narration is what sold me. Leonard Nimoy is the best, in my opinion, at this sort of story telling.Whether you agree with the facts or just enjoy a good mystery , this DVD delivers, albeit, for only 50 minutes, and there are no extras. So, find it at the lowest price possible, and enjoy.Now if they would only release the ""In Search Of"" series, that would be something. A terrific series about the Unexplained, Unknown, and Mysterious. Worth your time if you like stories with incomplete facts and/or endings. Also narrated by Leonard Nimoy."
4,Great presentation,"This is one of the first Sasquatch videos I had ever seen. It presents the material beautifully if a little dated. I had to get it for the collection. THis had lots of data, and was narrated well by Leonard Nimoy [ another bonus!!]its one of the cryptozoology videos you simply have to have!"
4,The Best Bigfoot Documentary,"This is probably the best documentary on Bigfoot that has ever been done before. It almost treats it as if Bigfoot does exist. There is even one part in the film where they try to give an accurate analysis of the lifestyle of this creature. If you are, like me, into cryptozoology or a Bigfoot enthusiast, then this video is for you. I would recommend buying this video now because I truly believe Bigfoot will be ""discovered"" and proven to be an unknown species of ape that survived the Ice-Age and has remained hidden up until the Twenty-First Century."
2,computer enhanced reveals...,"There are yetis to be found,but this classic film may show a...Zipper!...so it's back to costume designer..& try again"
2,unsatisfactory,"As it is, I never get any good p.r., cause you silly pink apes can't use a camera right! I was really hoping they would have photographed my better side! Hey, who tapped my trees. I'll have to watch my language from now on! Oh well..."
5,Casino 2000,Loved the simplicity of this game and enjoyed learning how to play video poker and other Vegas games. This game gives you help on every move. I found it informative and lots of fun. Hope Avery offers it on Vista.
2,Cute but ...,"When it arrived it was cute and color was soothing but after the first/initial wash in warm water it start falling apart. First, the treads around the frog's ""wrists"" came loose and than soon after the head almost fell off. For this price, it should perform much better. Even though I love the idea about babies teething on the organic cloth vs. plastic toys, this was quite a disappointment."
2,EZ Setup BAD Sound,"Ok heres my boring story:I got the top of the line computer and the ""best"" speakers aka boston speakers. I have had so many problems with the sound turning off for no reason, the speakers make weirdd noises from no where, and even though this system is easy to set up it is still hard to listen to those nice CDs of games without hearing a ""slam"" or a stop in the middle of a peacefull waterfall CD or in the middle of an online game of StarCraft. These Speakers are not the best i would go with another company not boston."
4,"Not perfect, but useful","Ok, this is just a quick review. The other three reviews are all fair in their own way (even the negative one...). However, I wanted to add an important point. Students enjoy this book (for a class assigned book). The level of argument is high enough to challenge without being too difficult to follow (with some help). The author's bias is enough to keep it interesting without overwhelming. Best of all, the seemingly simple idea of ""what it means to be an American"" has an insidious way of seeping into everyone's thinking in a very destabilizing way. Can you be ""un-Swedish, un-Czech, un-Chinese, un-Indian...?"" but for some reason being ""un-American"" makes more sense. Scholars and teachers may be less than impressed with such a simple and un-nuanced division, but the typical 21 year old college student can generate some interesting conclusions when presented with it."
1,Terrible,"This entire CD is ridden with cheesy vocals......from track one to twelve. If that is what you are into, then this is the disk for you. If you're into horns, whistles, & sirens....this is the one for you.The baselines sound like the ones you would find in an early nineties ""bass"" CD.I had to take this CD out of my car, just after one day of having it.I have seen DJ Spice a couple times(with DJ Friction) and they rocked. Brad Smith has put out other sick tracks. Just not sure what happened with this one.P.S. I have never written a review before on any CD I have purchased, even if it was one that I did not care for that much. But CD made me break that trend."
5,Great product and seller,"Chuckit Large Flying Squirrel Frisbee (orange & blue color - large 11""x11"") Dogs love 'em!!"
1,short lived fun,this product was not at all rugged. It fell apart after just two play sessions with our dog. Our complaint to canine hardware fell on deaf ears - no refund was forthcoming - and they did not even have the courtesy to respond. I'll never buy another one of these products.
3,LOVE these for our pups: BUT:,"They need double seams throughout them, not just in a place or two. They will last when just used for play, not as chew toys, we don't allow that, and make sure to keep our 2 occupied and not allow tugging which will kill these in two weeks of regular throwing and catching... we love them and they are the best for what we use them for, but they simply do not last as long as they should for the money, and we wish for them to made better. I hope to high someone who is responsible for manufacture will see this review and do something about it."
1,Not Great,I did not see any appreciable changes and I did find that the product had an unpleasant odor....like it was old and/or past it's expiration. Couldn't find the expiration date. Ended up not using the product.
3,Feels nice,"Goodhouskeeping recommended this product. They said it really took away fine lines, etc. I bought the product. It has a very nice texture and feels good, but there was no reduction in fine lines."
1,Save Your Money!,"I was excited to use this product and had read good things about it. Plus, I had a $2.00 off coupon. At least I didn't lose as much money as I would have without the coupon. The product did absolutely nothing for me. I used it faithfully for 2 weeks. I have very fine lines around my eyes and mouth and truthfully noticed no difference. I am disappointed in yet another useless product. Shame on me for continuing to fall for gimmicks."
5,Wonderful CD,"This is an absolutely great CD with great lyrics, but it pales in comparison to seeing them live, which I had the good fortune to twice this past year."
5,Great stuff!,"Excellent record, better than just about anything else being put out these days. Good for fans of all kinds of ROCK music. The singer reminds me of '70s metal (in a good way) and the mix punk and metal guitar sounds is a great combination. Fans of Strung Out and Rise Against should like this. My favorites on this are Slowdown, Three Years, Know Your History, Poverty For All. Highly recommended."
5,German Girl?,"Once started, I could not put the book down. It was very interesting, well written and held me captive until I finished it. This is a prespective of this time in history that is different from anything I have read before. I strongly recommend reading this book both for the enjoyment of the writing and also for a historical value."
3,Only ok,"Not very much on the holocaust experience, but interesting. It held my attention better than most of the books on the this subject I have purchased"
3,Intense story.,Moving story that brings you to tears. Hard to believe what Vivian and thousands more had to endure not only during the war but years after!
4,Actual historical accounts of WWII,"Captivating story...excellent descriptions of a child's yearning for love and acceptance during the ravages of war, desertion, poverty, abuse, and rejection."
4,The untold story.,"A well written account of life in Germany during and after WWII. The author chronicles her life and the lives of her family, including her Jewish father, until her eventual emigration to the United States. Well worth a read, it was enthralling and educational."
2,not what I had hoped for,"Thot this would be Celtic music, but it was New Age. If you like New Age, this is definitely for you. If it's Celtic you're after, pass on this one. (There are a couple with Celtic names, but the beauty of the tunes has been obscured.)That said, she's a fantastic fiddler, and if you like her playing, you will like this disc. Just know it's not Celtic. mb"
5,"If You Like the Dixie Dregs, Check This Lady Out!","Mairead Nesbitt is, by far, the best thing about the Celtic Woman series. An infomercial showcase of Ireland's cutesy-wutesy toothache gooey schmoo for people who can't handle the likes of Clannad's early music, Nesbitt is surprisingly and refreshingly different from David Downes' usual posse of chanteuses in evening gowns. Not only is Mairead's Raining Up worth your time, but if you like bands like Kansas and the Dixie Dregs, you will find this album strikingly appealing. She has an amazing technique and a dynamic spirit that's great to listen to anytime, any place, anywhere. Combining obviously strong Celtic music with a bit of classical, pop, and jazz fusion, even classic rockers will find her enjoyable. Fresh, innovative, and full of zest, Mairead can deliver hot licks on the violin that can match pros twice her age. Fave tune has to be the haunting, passionate ""Blue Light."" Don't pass this one up!"
5,Maired Nesbitt - Celtic Woman,I would like to see Mairead Nesbitt play along side Charlie Daniels and Alison Krause. This woman can play a violin better than anyone I have ever seen.
3,Violinist,After watching Celtic Woman and finding out Mairead Nesbitt had her own CD I had to buy it. I have a stereo system with 7 speakers and I'm not sure why the CD only played in stereo (2 speakers)and not surround. Four of the tracks I really liked and the others were okay. The ones I liked best is where she played the violin solo (last 3 tracks) as she is very talented.
5,Great MUSIC!,Mairead knows how to make the fiddle speak to you! Her style of celtic is smooth and feminine.
4,The fiddle player,"Mairead is such an inspire violin/fiddle player. Mairead playing is up to par & just as good as her Celtic Woman DVD playing.She needs to do a DVD of her playing, I enjoy watching her moments as she plays."
1,Disapointed,"I am a big fan of Celtic Woman, but this music CD seemed rushed and not as interesting as the C/W product. I'd spend my money on the C/W cd's and DVD's."
5,helps identify hidden triggers to trauma burried from war,"This book reveals why vets from war react as they do to life. Their survival tactics that got them home alive from war are now the cause of their problems. Long ago burried scenes are replayed by certain sounds, sights, smells, dates or something else that makes the war a daily reminder to them. Many live the war but don't know why. This excellent book helps the vet identify their partcular triggers and helps them to accept and deal with it without self medication. Modern help has overlooked the spiritual side of man that can give him a new identity. I recommend this book to any person who has a traumatic experience that has changed them."
3,"A good read, but...","Not nearly as interesting as the premise. Good characterizations again by JP, but the novel suffers from too much time spent on a sea-borne mission that frankly bored me a bit. A good addition to the CoDominium canon nonetheless."
1,there are better products out there,"This stopped the problem from getting worse, but it didn't fix the problem. I used it religiously as the instructions stated, with no improvement. I think there are different types of fungus so this may work for you even though it didn't work for me.I much prefer Fungi Nail, which hasn't completely fixed it yet, but has noticeably improved it. My old crumbling nail is almost completely grown out. The new nail is still thick, but clean looking. I'm afraid I'll have to spend more money to get it back the way it was before I got nail fungus."
4,it was good,A little thinner than expected .....but good quilityPackaged nicely ...over all I was happy with the purchaSE i made
3,"better than decaf or tea, but only slightly","If you have already switched to decaf coffee (which is only coffee-ish, at best) and want to take the extra step, this might work for you. Also, if you don't really like coffee and find that you only drink it if it is loaded with sugar, cream, vanilla, hazelnut, etc., any of Teeccino's flavored ""coffees"" will probably help you get the caffeine out of your diet. BUT, if you love the taste of rich, dark, black coffee, this one ain't even close!! None of them is. The smell and taste of chicory drive any similarity to coffee right out! Before switching to Teeccino, I suggest trying one of the coffee-chicory blends carried in most grocery stores and see how you like it. If you do, then try adding more Teeccino chicory to the coffee+chicory and gradually shift over."
5,MAYA CAFFFE,So good that I don't think I could go back to regular coffeeTeeccino Maya Caffe All-Purpose Grind Naturally Caffeine-Free. 8.5 Ounce cans (Pack of 6)
3,Sort of works,"The product works haphazardly. I use a desktop and laptop with a port replicator. For the first two weeks it would switch OK when you hit the numlock key twice. Now it will only switch to the laptop if the desktop is off. I have not been able to figure out why that is, and tech support is non-existent.In addition, the speaker hookups are buzzy, possibly because they aren't shielded (or, if they are, not very well).So, for about two weeks it was great. Since it stopped being great for no apparent reason, I'm crossing my fingers and hoping it will start again at some point. In the meantime, any suggestions for a USB KVM switch that works would be welcome."
5,Myth 2 review,"Myth 2 is actually the best game I have ever played. I got Myth 2 about 2 years ago. And over those 2 years I have bought about 6 new games and I still think Myth 2 is the best game I have ever played. Its the only game I play.Its multiplayer is the main reason I play the game. you can play up to 16 people at a time. And the maps you download are the funnest. One map is so good, Its the only map I play."
1,UCK!!!!!,I will not even comment on this piece of trash. Because I threw it in the garbage where it does belong.
3,I'msure it was really fun at one time,These days I usually compares games like this against Starcraft 1 OR Command and Conquer. It's a little on the slow game pace side (even after speeding it up a bit). My kids thought it was ok then asked when can we play command and conquer or starcraft 1.::sigh:: Wish something like that would come out natively for linux :/
3,good club/trance cd,"Over all this is a great cd. It starts off well and finishes well. It seems to bring with it a energy that you can feel, good bass lines with few but good vocals. except for the German in one song. A solid CD to add to your collection. Also comes with a free cd you can watch in your computer. I have not yet watched this so I can't comment on this yet. But it's always nice to hear from Dj's and see club footage. so pick up a copy and enjoy I;m sure you will."
5,ATROCITY IS ANYTHING BUT!,"Alex Krull and company take the path they were on with the brilliant ""B.L.U.T."" and kick it up 20 notches. Where ""B.L.U.T."" was a loose and discordant monster, this album is a tight, discordant battering ram with the weight of Atlas' burden propelling it. The technicality displayed on their classic Roadrunner release ""Longing for Death"" and ""Hallucinations"" is taken to a new zenith towering above most of the known world. There are some real scorchers on this album owing a lot to the likes of Darkthrone & Bathory, only with excellent musicianship and flawless production. And then, your anomaly ""Love is Dead"" proving that Type O Negative is total crap, and even gothic metal can be technical, agressive and depressive and still sound great. This is the Pinnacle of Death Metal, only to be mentioned alongside of Death Metal Masters the likes of Hypocrisy, Edge of Sanity, Opeth and very few other who reign the 7th Heaven of the Genre."
4,Hurray for British Detective Novels,"This is my first time reading a book with Inspector Bill Slider, and this is the first in the series. I will certainly be reading the rest. This is a great detective story. Tight plot, great characters, and enough human interest to keep your attention. Slider is an endearing hero, a good cop, a sweet man, and enough humbleness to make you like him a lot. I definitely recommend this series."
4,First in the Bill Slider Series-- Audio Review. Followed by Death Watch.,"On her blog Cynthia Harrod-Eagles writes that this was meant to be a stand alone novel written to amuse herself. It was her publishers who wanted a mystery and I am sure Slider fans everywhere thank them. First published in Britain in 1991. The audiobook narrator is Terry Wales. He's very competent and has become the voice of this series for me.A body is found in an empty flat. The body had no clothes, no personal possessions, no apparent cause of death and no name. Before it is possible to determine whodunnit or whydunnit, he must figure out who the corpse was.In this book many of the recurring characters in the series are introduced-- Slider, his wife Irene, his bag man Sergeant Atherton, the police doctor Freddie Cameron and various other habitues of the Shepherd's Bush police station.The book lasts about 10 1/4 hours and is well worth a listen. The puns are priceless.The next in the series isDeath Watch."
1,Not as advertised - doesn't fit 1370DEVS,"In the description for this product it states that it works with the following models:""Used on Model No. : 1250DEVS, 1370DEVS, 3727DVS, 3727DEVS""Unfortunately it doesn't fit my 1370DEVS. :^("
5,The Best Star Charts,"Recently, I have looked through a lot of astronomy books and Touring the Universe really stands out. It's packed with information that's presented in an attractive and understandable format with a lot of colorful graphics. What truly sets this book apart are the star charts that cover the entire celestial sphere. Wherever I go in the world, I have a star chart for it. Combined with the tables of events, I can plan my vacations for whatever is happening up there-until 2017!"
4,An excellent light comedy,One of Tracy and Hepburn's better efforts with excellent support from Gig Youngand Dina Merrill. For the time the movie is set in the fear about computers was very real.
5,a splendid compilation,"Was really looking for only ""Without Love,"" and had some of the others already, so there were some to share with friends. Who could say fairer?"
3,"Rating a bit low for Tracy-Hepburn, but has its charms...","This wide-screen color comedy pits the hands-on research crew, all female, at a large NYC corporation in the '50's, against the coming of technology in the form of a giant, noisy, imperfect early computer. Kate leads the reference whiz kids, Tracy pioneers the scary machinery that threatens their jobs. Gig Young and Dina Merrill and Joan Blondell add sparkling supporting performances. So what's wrong? Well, compared to the Hepburn-Tracy pairings of earlier years, this one is overlong and has a script that sizzles only in spurts. One thing I've noticed, however, is that every time I see it (about four viewings now over the past 20 years or so) it gets more enjoyable. Tracy, especially, makes a low-key character consistently interesting via facial expressions, body language, and ""stage business."""
4,Ahead of its Time,"This movie amazes me with the way it addresses the paranoia in the workplace that computers created back in their infancy. Employees saw computers coming but were afraid that they would take over their jobs. Spencer Tracy plays a systems designer/consultant that is implementing IT systems in the company Katharine Hepburn is employed. When he finally gets to her department, pandamonium ensues among the employees. The final role the computer takes in the company symbolizes the way computers will be used in the workplace for the next 50 years. The side story between Hepburn and Tracy is classic. They didn't make another movie together for 10 years (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?)."
4,Enjoyable movie but frustrating pan-and-scan,"The movie itself is a lot of fun, but the pan-and-scan method doesn't work here. I don't remember the funny parts so much as my frustration at hearing actors who weren't onscreen but were meant to be. Still, look for the scene in which Tracy gets Hepburn and a friend laughing so much I wondered if it wasn't for real, and then a moment later, while they're still laughing, he does something else, and you just know from the way Hepburn totally falls apart that it wasn't in the script."
4,4 Stars for the Value,"About half the movies in this collection are just terrible. But the other half are fantastic. The special features, which includes a spirited interview with an elderly Hepburn was terrific. For the $20 I paid for this, I'd buy it again. It's a good value."
5,LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE,"Watch it. especially at Christmas time. The rooftop scene is a classic, not to be missed, as is the scene after they were caught in the rain."
1,don't buy this video.,"But do try to catch the W-I-D-E-S-C-R-E-E-N version that airs from time to time on AMC (AMCTV.com). The composition of most of the shots is poor on this videocassette. the original film has the aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which means that all shots with 4-5 characters have half the characters speaking from off camera."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"I'm sure this is a cute movie, but the DVD seemed to be poor quality. It is very difficult to watch. I'm going to try and return it. I'd like to exchange it and try again, as I'm sure this is a good classic movie worth watching and adding to my collection."
5,Tracy & Hepburn,"Tracey and Hepburn are both fine actors. The chemistry between them is apparent, whether in conflict, social setting or being intimate. The variety of situations portrayed in the 9 movies is also interesting covering a broad view of life in the U.S over several decads."
4,Loved it.,I saw this for the first time on TMC. I bought it to watch with my 26 year old daughter. It was very cute. It was my first time seeing Tracy Spencer and Katharine Hepburn together in a film. You can see the magically chemistry between them.
5,Sophisticated love story,It is one of my favorites of Katharine Hepburn. The dialogue is very witty and shows her talent.
4,Desk Set,"Desk Set, yet another Hepburn-Tracy classic, is a wonderful tale of interesting times at the office when a new man enters with a machine. Is this machine going to replace Hepburn and her other co-workers? The tensions rise and fall throughout this interesting film."
3,Ugh,"I thank my wife for turning my towards all those wonderful wonderful movies from the past. Tracy and Hepburn are amazing together and this film is no exception.Unfortunately, this is the most boring Tracy-Hepburn movie I've seen yet. And even though I knew it was going to happen, I didn't see the love and connection between the two until the very end. Maybe it was because I was asleep for part of it. But come on, it was all about Tracy answering phones and taking notes. Sumner was so low-key about everything I thought he had aspergers or something.My favorite seen, however has to be when they were in the apartment together, just chillin', eating dinner in their bathrobes. I long to eat dinner in my bathrobe. If only my wife would let me.It is best for collectors, but not worth a second glance, for me."
2,Few laughs in this comedy,"What a disappointment! This is one of the famous pair's worst film together - only the leaden and preposterous Keeper of the Flame is worse. Strange as it may seem, Tracy and Hepburn display almost no onscreen chemistry in this film. Instead of a sharp, witty spoof of the dawning computer age, we get a flat-footed film with almost no laughs. Stay away from this one!"
2,Not what I hoped,"Love the prints of the films and the one I was waiting to see for I had never viewed it was ""The Sea of Grass"" which was unable to play so this put a dampner on my overall enthusiasm for this less than defintive collection."
2,Seller misinformation?,"Arrived in small black bag with no Instructions or Warranty. Seller says warranty is from manufactuter, but who / where is that? Seller (Watchespro) unresponsive to questions regarding missing paperwork or use of Swarovski Brand Name in description. Answered quick when they wanted my $$ but now no contact back.Seller's description totally inaccurate: ""18K gold plated"" / misuse of Swarovski Brand name / ""Japanese mechanics"" but small tag hanging from it says ""Made In CHINA"".Looks better in picture."
3,Over-idealized family life of bi-racial child,"This was a sentimental story about a little girl's year after her parent's divorce. Showing how both her and her cat grow. It touches only lightly on the bi-racial character of her family background. That family is highly idealized, both grandparents living and with nice homes, all getting along fine.Unfortunately, I came to this title from the Multi- Racial Activists' page because of specific concern over a bi-racial girl whose life is far from ideal. As a fact her life was filled with betrayal.The highly idealized nature of the family in this book is not particularly realistic, specifically in the southern States. It doesn't touch on any controversial issues the complicate a bi-racial child's life, therefore is not appropriate for activism. Pamela jean Curry Film Director in Training, Film Studio Faux, Parody"
2,The size is just not right,"The shoe itself looks fine, but the size is just not right you probably need to order at least a full size down for this shoe."
4,Nice knife.,"I've only had this knife for a couple of months and have only carried a handful of times as I also purchased the SOG Aegis at about the same time. I really like Spyderco products, and this knife is no exception. It is very light and comfortable to carry. The blade is also very sharp. I think it's a great every day carry blade."
4,good knife for the money,"I have had several spyderco knives prior to this one and am accustomed to vg-10 steel. This steel is easy to sharpen and maintains an edge for a decent period of time. My only problem is the handle which is FRN, a type of cheap plastic, spyderco did not make the handle nearly as abrasive as i would have liked it to be i am more of a fan of the g-10 handle. All in all this is a very good EDC knife for the price point."
4,Centofante 3,"I received this knife from Amazon this past Monday. Their shipping was very prompt as it was ordered the Saturday before.As for the knife it is very nice. The lockup is tight without any blade play. The blade came shaving sharp from the factory, I love the weight of the knife, and the handle is very nice. It carries (tip up) as if it isn't in your pocket.I only gave it 4 Stars for the following reasons. The blade if off center within the handle, and very close if not touching the liner in the knife. I haven't noticed any rubbing, but I will watch this and send it back to Spyderco should it become an issue. Also, the trademark Spyderco blade hole has a slight burr. While not sharp, it's definitely noticeable, and could have been corrected at the factory."
2,Bad design on this one.,"I have several Spyderco knives and I really like them, but this particular model seriously suffers in the design of the thumb rest and the handle. The plastic handle on this knife is too small and does not cover enought of the hilt when closed. When the knife is closed, the bottom corner of the hilt is exposed from the handle of the knife. If you carry the knife in your right pocket, using the clip, your hand will get scraped by the sharp corner everytime you reach in your pocket. This coupled with angle of the serrated thumb rest causes your hand to get snagged. Choose a different model Spyderco."
4,Reliability,I use c3 on many of my road patrols and house-to-house search. light and strong. very sharp. very comfortable gripping. Also good for off-duty hours. Quality knife at at very good cost. Recommended as your EDC.
3,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this knife. The VG-10 hollow-ground blade is beautiful to look at, but clearly fragile. It arrived with a nick on its edge, and clearly wouldn't stand up to determined use.The handle doesn't contain steel liners, which makes it very lightweight and does nothing for the balance or durability. It is pinned (rather than screwed) together, which makes longer term blade tension adjustments and cleaning impossible.It definitely doesn't look like a $50+ knife, being made from the cheapest-looking plastic. The tacky logo on the handle makes it look more like a teenager's toy rather than a gentleman's tool."
4,lightweight EDC,"Attractive lightweight EDC. I like the paladium silver bug inlay. Shaving sharp right out of the box. Thin blade great for slicing; not made for heavy work. Opening is a little stiff, but getting easier with time."
4,"Good gentlemen's knife,","All knives have a purpose some are heavier duty than others, but all can be used for basic EDC. This knife its a knife to show, it looks very proper and dressy. It has good ergo and lines. The blade its VG10 very sharp good edge retention. Very light good pocket clip very nice size blade. Its elegant even if the handle/scales its not made of an expensive wood, stag or bone. The only down side that I can think of is that you can't take it apart, some people might never have the need to do that but its a good option to have. The price is good also. It is one of my favorite knives and what makes it more special is that I got it for Father's day."
4,"Good, not great","I got this in July of 2011 and loved it for a month or so then i got a delica 4. Started using this at work and worked great until two of the three clip screws fell out. This wasn't spyderco's fault because i definitely abused it alot. Only reason i knocked off a star was because the blade steel, VG-10, can get a ""roll"" in the edge. But if this happens, just sharpen it and it will disappear."
5,I will give this as a present for every occasion from now on,"Hands down the best DESSERT cookbook. Every recipe has a gorgeous picture. My husband grew up with his mom making the Coca-Cola cake. We have looked for 30 years, and finally found the recipe in her book. I made it for him, and I agree with him, it was the best cake we've ever had~!This will be the item I give for all wedding presents from now on!"
3,Disappointing,"I should have listened to the reviewer who commented that the recipes lack variety. She's absolutely correct. It seems the recipes are one variation of a basic recipe changing only proportions and mix-ins. I call it Dairy Queen baking - change the chips, chocolates and candy and voila! A new recipe. For a book this price I expected more. Also I understand the author loves coconut but that doesn't mean she should include it in so many of her recipes. As an experienced baker I can substitute and modify the recipes to suit my taste but what about budding bakers who may not be confident enough to do that? Besides if I buy a book only to modify the recipes in it, shouldn't I be better off buying a different book? One whose recipes I already like?I wish I could return this book. I was seduced by the gorgeous pictures and interesting anecdotes. In the end I found out the hard and expensive way that it was more form than function"
5,I LOVE this book!!,"This is an awesome book for a complete chocoholic like me - it's filled with rich, amazing-sounding chocolate desserts of all kinds. I disagree with the reviewer who complained about the flowery pages - I thought they were lovely, and the book's photography is gorgeous. I seriously want to eat some of the pages. These recipes are not healthy by any means, but they're easy to follow and, if you're going to bake from a book called Chocolate Chocolate, you're probably looking for a little indulgence anyway! Yum."
2,Too much Candy,"I was so disappointed in this book - and it looked so promising. I noticed many reviewers commented on its prettiness which is great if you want pretty in a cook book, but I want quality, accuracy and good instruction.I really have a problem with the number of recipes that use pre-purchased candy bars and/or cookies. I would have liked alternative recipes to make my own. I cannot imagine me presenting a dessert to guests in which the primary ingredient is Heath Bars!I also have a big problem with everything being 'measured' in cups, spoons, etc (except the chocolate). Where are the weights?Much of the chocolate in the recipes is unsweetened chocolate. This is not easy to obtain in many countries and no substitutions are given.Altogether very disappointing."
2,"Lovely to look at, but recipes just aren't that impressive","I had high hopes for this book, but found the recipes repetitive and somewhat boring. I've made 4-5 of the recipes so far and feel I have better tried and true recipes already in my collection. I do find the photography beautiful, and the graphic art pleasant, so I guess the book isn't a total loss..... Disappointing - I would not recommend this book to any of my baking friends (I would loan them mine and tell them to keep their money for another cook book)."
5,"Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous","This is truly a spectacular book. The recipes, layout, and photographs make it one of the loveliest cookbooks I have ever seen!!!!!!!!! It is definitely the type of book any baker would want to own, keep over the years, and refer to often. Absolutely award winning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Buyer beware!,"The highway pegs looked great. Installed easily. Instructions were straight forward. But, buyer beware! Within one week, and using the pegs only one time to test them out, I was riding down the road and noticed that one of the pegs had unfolded to the position you would use them at. I tried to stow the peg with the top of my toe and zing! Off came the peg at 40 mph and demolish into several pieces. I had tightened every bolt on the pedals prior to riding. I wouldn't waste my money on these!"
4,On the Highway to Hell,"Ok I am new to riding so I have been taking in lots of suggestions one of which was highway pegs.I had so many options I didn't know what to go with so I started reading reviews. I narrowed it down to two choices both made by Kuryakyn 1) was the longhorn offset pegs or 2) the Iso pegs A few reviews also helped me to make a choice the longhorns for some were too long. I am 5'10'' so I went with the ISO- peg mounts. I ordered them on a Monday and the arrived on Wednesday so yes fast shipping. I also want to mention for some reason they show three in the picture, you get the one in the middle fyi. It took me all of 5 minutes to install them and wow it is a great feeling to be able to stretch out your legs for a long ride. I have a 2011 Kawasaki Vulcan 1700 NOMAD they go well with the look of the bike and are very comfortable to stretch out on them. In short buy em."
1,Outrageous,"Whatever the content may be, no matter how brilliant, this book is way overpriced. That is all too prevalent with investment type books that appeal to a very small contingent, in this case Point and Figure. Too bad."
5,Blitz is harcore fun,Blitz is the best football game out there. for one thing theres no ref (how fun is that). you can beat up the other players with insane tackles!!!!!!. the most simple but great plays (if you dont know much about football). theres great touchdown dances (with sound afects). you can here the players yelling taunts at eachother (thats the really fun part) and theres secret teams to unlock. get better stats for your team by winning pary games. this all a football fan could want.
5,Funnest Football Game for the PC yet!,"Just to let you know, I run this game on my new Dimension Dell Desktop PC which has a Pentium III 1 GHz processor. Although NFL Blitz 2000 has no rules like a real NFL game, that's what makes the game incredibly fun and entertaining. The graphics are best when run in 1074x768 resolution and using Direct3D, or it could just be that I have a 64MB video card. The fields are greatly detailed, as well as the ""playbooks"" and the players. They even do dances when they score touchdowns and tackle with the forces of 300 lb. men on steroids (umm, wait a minute...). I recommend using an external controller, such as the Gravis Xterminator Digital Gamepad, which is what I use. This game is worth every penny of the price Amazon charges, it will keep you entertained as long as you have it!"
5,Music lover,"Stanislav is extraordinary talent! You will find his performance amazing if you love lyrical expressionist style. He can bring extra feelings and passion to every piece of music. But if you regard Glen Gould the most, you can be disappointed."
5,worth paying a couple extra bucks over the plastic ones,"I bought this in hope that it would last longer than the regular plastic DDR mats. So far ive had one for at least 2 years and another for about half a year, both still work perfectly, the old plastic ones i used to buy only lasted for 2-3 months given that i play on double challenge or double heavy mode. It also doesnt start cracking after a while like the plastic ones i had did when i folded them up to take to peoples houses and play."
1,Stop working after one month,"I ordered 2 pads, and both of them stopped working after about a month."
4,Extra pad helps,The padding in this matt is better than the matt that comes with the game. It helps reduce the impact on your joints.
1,Connectors Stick - Game Play Impossible,"I have used the Red Octane Ignition pads for several years. Recently, I couldn't find them online anywhere, so I bought these pads instead. The foam inserts are a little softer than in the Ignition pads, but I could have gotten used to that.However, after about five hours of play, the connectors started to stick, sending a message that the arrow was pressed when it wasn't. The most dramatic manifestation of this problem would come after I finished a game - the roulette wheel where you select songs would run around in circles endlessly. I could only get it to stop by picking up the pad and shaking it. And of course this problem prevented any accurate record of my accuracy or calories burned, since all these extra steps were being inserted.I returned the pads and decided to go for the cobalt flux pad. I'll just have very calloused feet..."
3,DAMN Trance,"I'm not into this ""Save my soul"" song. It contains a sample of Eddie Amador's ""Rise"", check that song out instead. A lot of the other songs aren't so good, including ""Communication"" (This isn't THAT bad, but I think it's way longer than it needs to be, at almost 9 minutes, and almost anyone can agree to that unless you're a huge Armin Van Buuren fan), and ""Miami"" (Just not good). Jon The Dentist is not a bad mixer but his songs on here just aren't so great. His song ""Silence"" is okay, though. My favorite song on here is ""Sex"". It somehow stands out from the rest, and it reminds me a lot of Voodoo & Serano's ""Blood Is Pumpin'"" toward the middle of the song."
5,Short But Sweet,"I agree,Eugene you are an f'in idiot,you sure as hell dont know your stuff too well.Im a major trance fan,have been since 98' I know whats good and whats not.This is probably coming from a newbie that listens to such garbage as Tiesto's ""Just Be""..haha.This is some damn fine trance straight from South Beach.""Icarus""is one of the best progressive trance tracks ever composed.My only complaint is that the disc is way too short.Where oh where did this awesome dj dissapear to?Buy this ,dance fans"
2,Not worth it,"I do NOT recommend this CD. It's pretty bad and amateurish. The track selection and mixing are both poor. Especially Jon the Dentist's own track ""Save my soul"" is simply ridiculous. I honestly had a better opinion of this producer (DJ?) before."
1,when it works...,"I've been trying to get this product to show me the screens it shows on the packaging without success.The voice interface has exhibited non-responsive commands.Can't access the detailed street guides, nor am I able to find a screen for the detailed street directions that appear on the box!When asked to compute the route, keep getting an error message. ""Can't compute the route""!They want you to go into selective commands from ""msconfig"" if certain apps don't work. They must be joking!!!!Why would anyone want to mess with ""msconfig"" and risk screwing up your other apps??!!!!Documentation is on line only!!!!!!!!You can download a 122 page PDF file if you're so inclined.I don't think so!!!Their on-line suport page is a joke. No useable info for the problems that pop up for laptop use.GPS takes forever to locate sats. I could be there by then!Don't waste your time and money!Vb"
3,not bad but not great,"I was hoping to get a lot finer ability to ""clean"" up pops and hisses. It's editing tools turned out to be worse than the 100% free and open source ""Audacity"". It's an ok tool for converting your LPs (if you can actually find a turn table with the right outputs) as it does a halway decent job of detecting the end of one song and beginning of the next but there are simply far better completely free tools (such as Audacity)."
3,nice touches and views,"The writer gives a unique view of having close relationship to the Shah and surviving the revolutionary wrath. He gives sporadic views which most of the time can be accepted, but are not comprehensive or conclusive."
5,Adobe Premiere Pro 2 book opens the door,"I have been using Premiere since the days of 5.0 - and I think I have been applying only those same skills to each upgrade I purchased -- with maybe adding just a few new tricks. Mr. Rosenberg's clear explanations and teaching have opened up a whole new world of Premiere editing for me, and my newest DVD effort is showing the results ""in spades.""The DVD included is just perfect. Adobe should ship this book with the software."
3,"Well worth it, but a little out of date","This book is great for the beginner. It will start you out by teaching you the basics of file management and setting up your computer to handle video editing and will lead you through a series of 'projects' to teach you the basics of video editing.It also includes media with video clips to use in case you don't have any to begin with.It's great book if you have never done any editing, or if you have never done editing with Premiere. Even one version behind on the software version, it is still a very useful book."
3,Needs Optical Viewfinder,"This camera has lots of really nice features and is easy to use. Unfortunately it does not have an optical viewfinder. This makes it impossible to compose a picture in low light conditions and in certain angles (to the sun) outside. This gets especially bad if you wear polarized sunglasses outside (which black out the LCD display at certain angles). The 4mb memory card that comes with it is a joke. I purchased a 64mb card that works very well. With the exception of not having an optical viewfinder, it is a great camera."
5,Impressive,"The previous reviewers had 4mb memory sticks with their DSC-F505's, but I have 8mb? This dig.camera is great! I have taken over 1000 pictures with this camera and all of them rivals the conventional photos. USB interface with this camera is also impressive. In long trips you gotta have a laptop or a couple or more 64mb memory sticks coz it's hard not to take any pictures with this thing.The DSC-F505 is also user friendly and the manual is easy to understand. The sleek style also attract a lot of attention. My only complaint is that it has no optical vievfinder."
4,Factory replacement IROC springs,"I bought these springs for my 91 firebird. I had cut the previous coil springs a tad too much and the car was bottoming out in the rear. I hope not to replicate that problem this time around.... When I installed the springs, I was greeted with a 4.5"" fender gap. While that will stop the bottoming out, it is about an inch too high. Reading on thirdgen.org tells me I'm not the only one to find this out. Seems most cut one coil, and replace the isolator with some heater hose. I'll be attempting to do both to get the car down 1.5"" so it better matches the front springs."
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"This book has a few pieces of useful information ... but overall there are many much better books out there about generations and how they differ (e.g., Generation Me, When Generations Collide, Generations). The authors take a spattering of information from other sources (they are not researchers or policy makers themselves), tell a few narratives, and that's about it. You are much better off buying another book on generations.Also, notice the publisher: Focus on the Family. Thus the book is written from an explictly stated Christian perspective. For some readers this might be a bonus; others might be put off by this in a book that is not about religion."
2,Builders vs. Everyone Else?,"The authors bring out a few interesting points, but this book seems to be aimed towards reconciliation between builders (pre WW2 generation) and the rest of us. It paints a picture of each generation that could at best be called cartoonish. At worst, the picture painted is stereotypical generalizations drawn from a world where everyone is white and generations are easily classified. The chief problem with this book is its age. It fails to paint an accurate picture of today's generational divides due to its age.This book does create some interesting thoughts, but would be most useful in an aging church that is trying to change its mission to include younger generations."
2,"boo to ""soccer moms"" and hurray for working women everywhere","I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote of the guilt trip that this book gives to working mothers. I am an Australian who is residing in the USA, and I am shocked and appalled at the American attitude towards working mothers. In Australia it is the norm for women to pursue careers and work in fulltime jobs, whether they are single, married, de facto, mothers, young, old, whatever. Childcare is a policy issue for government, is often subsidised, and considered imperative for the growth of the economy and the wellbeing of the community. What assistance does the American government give to working mothers?! How does the American media portray mothers of Generation X?! The attitude here is so far behind it is laughable. For American authors to claim authority over subjects such as Generation X and its place on the world stage, they will need to update their ideas and look to other societies as well as their own."
4,great show,"I agree that every business owner should see this series. Some of the things Tabitha points out are so obvious but I see the same mistakes in many businesses, not just hair stylists. I am not sure how long the series will last because there is no manufactured drama in it. It is too honest for its own good. I hope it will be around for a while and will define a new type of reality tv, not the drama junk, but honest tv."
4,Tabitha's Taking Over Everything!,"It's always (well, usually) funny to watch Tabitha steamroll salons into getting with the program. Most of their problems are pretty obvious: clean up this darn place, tuck in your shirt and dress nice, don't be so disgusting and sloppy, educate your hairstylists, quit being so mean/rude, hold hands and sing Kumbaya, don't yell at work. She's kind of like your Mom, but paid better and much meaner.These salons should know that already, they just need Tabitha to tell them so they'll do it. However, six weeks later, they stop doing it again, because they're kind of stubborn and dumb. :( Or, they listen, because they're $mart!"
2,Disturbing and Sickening!,"This book has traumatized me. I can deal with the supernatural,murder,blood,and gore however not prolonged suffering. I was disturbed for several weeks due to some of the graphic torture. I suppose some people find this to be entertaining or interesting, but I don't personally find entertainment in such things and could barely stomach it. I guess I probably should have read some of the reviews here before I decided to spend my money. I would really love to give the book one star but I realize that I did finish the book (mostly because I wanted to find out if some sort of justice prevailed)and that its affects on me must indicate the author did something of what he intended to do. However, be warned---this is truly not a story for the faint or tender-hearted."
4,Couldn't put it down!,Chose this book because it's a true story n good reviews- so glad I did- really good! Sick people in this world.
3,Have to read it to believe it,I thought the book was good but too much rambling when getting into details about things not specific to the horrific torture. What a tragic story. Shows how insane people can be!
3,Eerie resemblance...,"I'm not quite sure how to rate this book. It was extremely disturbing, so to say ""I like it"" is completely wrong. It's well written, but I have a reservation. I read this book a few months ago, so imagine my surprise when I rented the movie, ""An American Crime,"" and noticed an eerie resemblance between the two. They're not identical, but...The names are different: Ruth is Gertie, for example. Ruth's kids are all boys; Gertie's are almost all girls. Of the two girls Ruth/Gertie takes in, the older one is pretty and well-behaved, while the younger one is meek and disabled. And the basement scenes are incredibly similar. An American Crime is told from the framework of a trial, seeing as it is based on an actual event from the 1960s in Indiana, so some small details are changed, but it's like the author re-imagined the 2007 movie."
1,I threw this book away when done,"This book was well written, the characters fleshed out, but the subject matter and the presentation just turned my stomach. It wasn't fun and exciting. It was like reading DCFS files and seeing pictures of the pain inflicted on children by sick twisted others. I threw the book away so no one else would have to remember it. It was too raw for me and that's saying a WHOLE LOT. Ketchum is a fine writer. Buy offspring instead if you want something that gory and depressing to read."
1,Unoriginal and Unnecessary,"The author has no imagination. He took the story outline from an actual crime, changed a few details, added some explicit gore, and gave it a new name. Read ""House of Evil"" by John Dean for the true story. ""House of Evil"" is even more disturbing because it's true. There was no need to repackage this horrible crime. Don't bother with this version."
2,Copycat story!,"This is a copycat of what happened to Sylvia Likens. Minor adjustments made, but basically the same story. Not very original. You should read the original story ""House of Evil"" by John Dean."
1,A difficult read at best,"I got halfway through this book and literally had to force myself to continue reading. It was sickening and revolting. I can't understand the praise it has received. It's borderline pornography and completely vile. I wouldn't recommend it...unless you like that kind of thing, I guess."
4,horrific,"This book was a first read for me by Ketchum. I will say only this, it is a book I will not forget soon."
2,I don't think so,"This was my first Ketchem book. I choose this one due to all the rave reviews. I don't know. Perhaps I am missing something; perhaps not. Maybe this is just not my cup of tea. I thought the writing was fair and the characters very fleshed out. But there is just so much of a girl tied up in a basement being tortured that could be interesting. It also got very frustrating watching all these people coming and going and watching the beat and not even saying anything about it. Sorry, I just didn't get it."
4,A true story,"Many reviewers -- and even Stephen King, in his introduction -- have missed something important here. This story takes place in the 50s, and may indeed seem farfetched ""even in this cynical age,"" but the sad truth is that it really happened. Much like his earlier ""Off Season"" (based on the Sawney Beane story) Ketchum, a fierce and eloquent writer, has based this tale on the true story of Gertrude Baniszewski and Sylvia Likens. Sylvia died in October, 1965. This true story is indeed sick and disturbing, but nonetheless happened, and Ketchum should be applauded for portraying the events in his unflinching style. The horror in this tale is, I think, only heightened by Ketchum's refusal to explain away Ruth's behavior. Why did Baniszewski do what she did? Who knows? But it happened, it's scary, and Ketchum told the story well. What more could you want from a book that used to have a skeleton cheerleader on the cover?"
5,Oh My God,"This is without question the most disturbing book I've ever read. It's like witnessing a deadly car crash with gore everywhere. You want to turn away but you just can't. Several times while reading this book, I tried to put it down but couldn't. Most disturbing of all was Ketchum admitting that he ""toned it down a little"" after re-reading it and that he based it on a true story. I couldn't imagine what it was like before. Very few books will affect you the this one will. Ketchum is a master at exposing the human monster."
1,DISTURBING,"This book was a train wreck. It grabbed my interest at the beginning, but ends up as a horror story of child abuse. The details are disturbing. This poor girl who is entrusted to a family member is subjected to the cruelest torture ever imagined. This is one book that I wish I had not even read."
2,Just didn't draw me in,"I ended up reading almost half of this book before I decided to quit. It is a rather dark book and it seemed repetitious to me and never really ""drew me in"". Sorry!"
2,Not something I would intentionally read again,"I rated this a two because the story is well written, it is the content that disgusted me. When I read some of the reviews, I saw horror, I have read horror books and I enjoy some of them. This one passed the horror level and went diving right into things I did not expect. There was mental illness and child abuse of such an extreme nature that it was disgusting. The story begins very mildly and you do not expect what you are coming to when it begins. Truly not a book for anyone who does not find the abuse of a child to be entertainment, as I certainly do not. I am not prudish and I understand things happen in this world that are just this disgusting, I just do not choose to find them entertaining. I am sorry that I ordered this book."
2,It should have been the torture of the girl next door.,This may have been written well and suspensefull but too graphic of prolonged torture of a young person.I had to skip over some of the torture to get to the end.
1,Warning!,"With such a wholesome sounding title, I was surprised at this perverse and sickening narrative. Maybe such things happen in the ""real"" world - but I surely don't want to read about them in my leisure time. Maybe this review will serve as a warning. I couldn't get it off my Kindle fast enough!!!"
1,The Girl Next Door,"Can I say terrible? I thought it was a corny rehash of ""Stand by Me"". It was too painful to finish. jf"
1,Horrific,"This is the most horrific, disturbing book I have ever read. I always finish a book once I start reading it, but in this case I had to force myself to do so. If it were possible to give less than one star I would do so.The book chronicles a group of young boys - encouraged by a psychopathic neighbor - who kidnap, torture, mutilate, rape and eventually kill a young girl who is their friend.I can't help but wonder what would motivate Mr. Ketchum to write this book.I also can't imagine anyone but a sadist finding anything positive about this book."
2,Just So SAD!!!,I thought surely there would be some retribution for the young girl but it just got worse and worse for her and then it ended. This is a book I won't forget for a long time.
5,Awesome book,"This book was hard to read and even harder to put down. The story was bone-chilling and even though I knew it was fiction, it felt so real. Jack Ketchum is an excellent writer, even though I hated the way it ended."
2,the girl next door,"i wish i would known how long this girl was going to be treated so cruel. it truly shows how messed up our system works. it is a depressing story on how these little girls got treated. you never know how your family will treat your children if you pass on and have to leave them behind. these girls would have been better off in system. it's not the system that is the prblem it's just some of the people working in it. people like to ignore children getting abused, don't want to get involved and this is a perfect example of what happens to them. put yourself in there shoes. i could not of lasted as long as this girl did. report abuse, save a soul, it only takes a phone call."
2,Disturbing,"I read other reviews before ordering this book and thought it would be a good one to select. It was very disturbing to me because child abuse strikes so close to home for me. The book was well written, but some of the language could have been left out. It is hard to fathom humans treating another human in that manner. I had to finish reading the book, but I almost feel like I need to remove the disgusting story from my Kindle."
2,Disturbing,"After reading this book I feel the need to write a review about this book. This book I found deeply disturbing and I would not recommend it.I am unsure why it is referred to as this author's 'most sought after book'.This book is an easy read, however, it left me uneasy and horrified as a parent.I understand that perhaps the author wanted to bring up the bigger idea that if we sit back and allow things to happen we are just as guilty as participating in what is occurring around us. Perhaps I am reading more into this book then what the author intended as well.This was not my type of book and I would NOT recommed it."
5,Riveting..........Good Read....,"I read this book based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. Took a little bit to get into the story, with the setting of the times/backdrop, but it all set the stage for one of the best reads I've had for awhile. Ketchum did an excellent job of having you completely picture the scene. The street, the house, the kids, the summer, maybe because I grew up in that era. The respect, or non-questioning of our parents attitudes, at our time of growing up, was so evident. Having the story told thru the eyes of a 12 year old was done so well. I finished this book in 2 days, had a hard time putting it down. And knowing this was based on a true story was even more compelling. It truly puts into perspective how much our parents pass on behavior and their thought processes. I am an avid reader and this was an excellent, well written book."
5,Life Changing,"I'm usually one to say I'm interested in books based on true stories. But this one had me cringing, and seeing red literally.The fact that this happened in real to a girl has me in a total outrage. The book isn't one for the faint of heart,or the weak. But though it may be a hard read for i think anyone,I'm glad i read it. Because, this girls murder will stay forever in my heart, and I'm glad that justice was served to those sick f***s(in real life)."
5,Disturbing and compelling.,"I ordered ""the girl next door"" book and DVD at the same time so decided to watch the film first which I thought was brilliant and brought me to tears at some points. The book I read some time later and it was breathtaking.Although the content is about as disturbing as it can get, I found that I was drawn in and sympathised not only with Meg but with David as well. One can only imagine what he went through being exposed to such evil at such a young age and I was really hoping Meg would live through the ordeal (although she didn't in the film).At some points I had to close the book and rest, it was so compelling, and I was hesitant in many points to keep reading.Very well written, Jack Ketchum is obviously a good writer and I look forward to reading more of his books.For those who say this should be banned, wake up. The atrocities in this book pale in comparision to real life crimes against children."
3,I'm torn.,"Although I found The Girl Next Door hard to put down, when I finished reading it, all I wanted to do was curl up in a dark corner and die. It made me feel horrible about the entire human race, knowing that somewhere, this horribly graphic and inhumane cruelty is actually happening."
4,Suburban Horror at it's best,"Jack Ketchum (Lauren Pain) is in his best form with this chilling novel which not only thrills but exposes the terrors of child abuse in middle class America in the 1950's. At a time when any ""family business"" was cinsidered taboo to divulge, especially by youngsters. Any fan of ""Off Season"" will not put this offering down until they reach the last page. For a chilling look in the basement of the ""House next door,"" read THE GIRL NEXT DOOR."
5,powerfully disturbing...,"This book is not a passive read. It affects you, draws you in and leaves you wrecked. I read a lot of horror, but nothing can perpare you for the feelings this book will bring on. Deeply depressing, horrfying, and guilt inspiring. I am completely impressed with Ketchum's ability to ring such emotion from the reader. If you can handle it, it is a book not to be missed."
3,Interesting Story line,The Girl Next Door is written in a unique format that drives the reader to the choices a young boy should make against the black side of neighbors.
4,A disturbing story.,The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum.A very disturbing story of human cruelty. When I learned that this book is based on a true story I realized that it really needed to be told.
2,True story of the 'Torture Mother',"I was happily reading TGND when I happened to do a google search and found the real story behind this horror novel. Then I just couldn't finish it. I like my evil stylistic and confectionary, think Dan Simmons Song of Kali and Poppy Z. Brite's Exquisite Corpse. But this....this evil is so raw and unbridled. And the fact that the neighbors just played along. Lastly, the complete and total innocence of the victim. Names and dates have been changed to protect the wicked...the only innocents in this are dispatched of at the end."
1,Author has problems of his own,"Did Jack Ketchum write this book while spending time in a Psychiatric Center? It looks to me he set out to write a book on a sick, perverted, scary story and he found one that took place in Indiana 1965 and put it in his own words."
4,DO NOT READ!! DO NOT READ!,"I read this years ago when it was hard to find and maybe more than any other book it has haunted me . to quote an old micheal douglas movie"" star chamber"": kiddo, right now youre as pure as the driven snow. if you continue to hear what I'm going to tell you, you can never go back. (or something like that)what I mean is don't open this book. you'll think about it for years."
2,Very poorly written,"This was one of the most poorly written true crime novels I have ever read.A well written true crime novel allows the reader to get to know the characters. It should also allow you to know the victim well enough to sympathize or at least understand the victim. This book doesn't do that. The author jumps back and forth between characters, confusing the reader. It is written in past tense with many situations barely skimmed over. I would not recommend this book on any level."
1,Torture session,"Most of this book is detailing the torture of a girl. There is a lot of areas this author could have picked to go with the story line such as how this affected the others involved instead he chose to into detail the torture. I am not sure that was not the point, sick."
4,The Girl Next Door,I couldn't put this book down. The abuse was a little hard to handle but it was written very well. It held me captive from start to finish.
4,Surprisingly good,"I hastily chose this book for my kindle. When I first began reading it, I was alarmed that it might just be a sensationalized story, created for shock value. I was pleasantly surprised that I felt the difficult subject matter was treated in a respectful and insightful way. The subject matter is intense, but the book is well-written and sensitive."
4,very well written though disturbing story,I just loved the way this book is written. the story is extremely disturbing considering its a true one. every gory detail i read i was squirming and asking myself ‘how could this happen in a country like america. ?‘
4,Innocence Lost,"Another tight yarn by Mr. Ketchum. Nothing fancy here, but he really does know how to punch you in the gut. He captures the lightness of a lost summer, and of course turns it on its head.First Ketchum book that I read was The Lost, and it blew me away. I have read most of his material since then, and The Girl Next Door is the closest to that visceral feel of The Lost.Not for the faint of heart, but well worth the read."
5,Sick and Wonderful...,"A pretty little girl, a quiet neighborhood, an insane aunt, and a cell in the basement are all that are needed to make this book a read that will keep you up long after you have closed the book. Meg is new to the neighborhood, after having been orphaned, she finds herself with her crazed aunt who has a serious grudge against her. At first the Aunt is just rude and uncaring towards Meg. However, once she begins fighting back, Meg's torture escalates into some of the most violent and terrifying scenes ever written. To add insult to [serious] injury, the boys from the block are all allowed to watch and sometimes to touch... Meg doesnt dare fight back anymore or her aunt will switch her evil attentions to Meg's crippled younger sister. Then things become unimaginable.This story is gruesome and horrible, but like a brutal car accident, it is hard to look away. The Girl Next Door will make you not want to meet your neighbors, or if you do, wonder what is in their basement.Relic113"
4,Positively disturbing,"I read this book in one evening. I probably should have spent more time with it, but in all honesty, I could not put it down. At the same time, I found the progression of the story rather predictable. Since I know now that the book is based on a true story, I realize that the predictable nature of the abuse only shows how depraved and sick the people involved truly were. Obviously they needed a new kick and felt the need to engage in progressively more disturbing torture methods. I found myself wondering, what sick thing are they going to try now? Definitely worth reading if you can stomach both the horrific nature of the plot line as well as the moral ambivalence of the main character."
1,Don't waste your time,"One of the worst books I have ever read. I'm not going to recap the story as I'm sure you've read the previous reviews. There's no suspense, horror or even storytelling, the only emotions I felt were boredom and revulsion. A book solely created to depict various means of torture."
2,Wicked aunt,Albeit this book is based on a real story as it says in the author's note. Although the main plot'll keep you reading and hating Ruth and at the same time David for doing nothing about the problem. The problem with this book is that could be written in manifold pages less. Who cares about the town's fair? Who cares about every introduction written at each chapter's beginning?This is the first book I read by JK and even though I do believe this wicked story could happen if not already happened this book'd be written in a briskly pace.P.S. The real action stars at page 100. So you can start the book in page 101.
1,A Man Disturbed,"I skimmed through the end of the book mostly because I couldn't believe these people were going to go through with what they were going through with. I was only looking for the part where David helps her and Susan escape and the evil family gets locked up, but it doesn't happen, so what's the point. It's difficult to fathom how a person could actually write a book like this, and why they would want to write it. Humans are sinful at best and there are many who are depraved. You have to be somewhat disturbed to write a book like this. There's nothing positive about it. It's one of the saddest books I've even read."
1,Revolting.,"I With little redeeming value, Girl Next Door drags the reader from one depressing scene to another, to an utterly joyless ending."
4,If this is based on....,a real life story. It is the saddest thing I've ever read. Very nice of Jack to change the names and town to protect the innocent.
2,Don't think i will read any more Ketchum,"Like others have stated, the first 100 pages are aweful. There is nothing goin on. We meet so many of these kids that have absolutly nothing to do with the story. When the horror starts its purly based on what this one neighbor kid sees, and we don't get to see into the mind of the actual abusers. The subject is there for the makings of a great book, but he missed it sorry."
3,Beware your friends and family,"While the reviews of this book were good I did not find it all that gripping. Yes, it was horrifying in its description of what man is capable of doing to his fellow man. What I found more interesting is the herd acceptance of what is right and wrong and the willingness of people to just go along rather than rock the boat."
4,Great book,This is a great book. I am looking forward to seeing the movie and I truly hope it does the book justice. This is one of Jack Ketchum's best.
4,So graphic...,It's hard to say I likes it because it was just so awful however the book did draw me in and I read it very quickly. The story was so sad and terrible that I really felt for the characters but I couldn't ever really recommend it because it was almost too awful.
3,The Girl Next Door,This was a sick book. I kept thinking that the neighbor boy would grow some gonads and rat out the neighbors.
3,Ok,I thought this book was ok. Not great. I am horrified by the events . I would not recommend this book to a friend .
4,A Heart Wrenching book,This was a well written story bordering on a horror due to the traumas inflicted on the next door neighbor girl by her guardian and the other people surrounding her. How anyone could stand by and watch this happen is unbelievable. Told from the perspective of the 12 year old next door neighbor boy it will keep you reading for hours on end.
1,Worse than Bad,"I read on average 3 to 4 books a week. This book was not worth the money, period. It goes nowhere and makes you feel like the pig who wrote it. If there is any truth to it the writer should be in jail or hell. After buying 700+ books from kindle (most which are scientific or maybe thrillers) I will rethink the ""summary"" from now on. Vomit."
1,Torture Porn,"As a result of being based on a true story the author seems to feel that it is his right to bore you with pages upon pages of torture. There is no pacing, no tension, no relief and quite frankly no story.It just seems to be endless pages of what can be best described as torture porn."
5,WOW! TORTURE!,"I've never read anything more disturbing than this book. Truly evokes a wide range of emotions and tells, first hand, an absolutely Hellish journey of an innocent! As f'd up as it is brilliant! Very frightful, very good! If you are reading reviews on this book than you must have already heard about it. just buy it already! I guarantee you that the movie isn't a fraction as disturbing as the literature!! A good read, just take a shower afterwards, just make sure the water is not too hot!"
4,Horrifying,"Wow, when you find out that there is information left out of this book b/c it's too digusting or horrifying to relate you know you've got a good piece of horror. I read this book in a day, & was completely mesmerized by Ketchum's storytelling. I thought the 1st person point of view was really interesting, you find yourself pulling for him & maybe not really wanting the believe that he acutally participated (passivley anyway).I would recommend it for any horror lover, the fact that it's rooted in truth makes it even more terrifying!"
3,Very disturbing,I had to read this book in spurts because it was so graphic. I skipped many pages since the torture was so real sounding and I could feel the pain this poor girl must have been feeling. To believe that out there humans of this caliber really exist is insane but true.
4,Horrible but good,Enjoyed it & would recommend it to others.Very brutal & you need a strong stomach.A good read tough
4,Grim Story,I wavered between three and four stars. The writer does a good job telling a sad story of abuse. Makes you feel for the victims.
3,Okay reading,This book was okay. It didnt really keep my attention. Of course I wanted t find out the end but it disappointed me.
5,An absolutely brutal book,"The fact that ""The Girl Next Door"" is set against the supposed innocence of 1950s just intensifies the brutality of the story. In this supposedly idyllic time and in an ""All-American"" suburb there is this deep, dark undercurrent of insanity and violence that you don't expect to find there. But the narrative takes you beyond simple unease. It takes you into the mind of the boy who watches the awful abuse of the girl Meg until you become a voyeur to the violence as well. This was a hard book to read and I literally felt wrung out and dirty after reading it. Ketchum doesn't pull any punches in his writing, though you may find that you wish he had. So why did I give the book 5 stars, you may ask? The book is unforgettably powerful, evocative, and well-written, and I shuuder a little every time I look at it. Excellent horror realism."
4,crazy book!,OMG. There were so many parts of this book that were jaw dropping and difficult to read. Some parts made me think of my own kids. Just awful what we can do to each other in the right situation!
4,Great Read!,This is my first read from Jack Ketchum and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. I was hooked from the moment I started reading. Story is slow in a few parts but overall it turned out great.
5,"Disturbing, yet captivating","I like a good psychological thriller now and again and Ketchum delivered with this disturbing fictionalization of an actual event. During the summer of 1958, David is witness to the brutal torture of Meg, a girl who has been placed in foster care of his next door neighbor, Ruth. Meg and her sister Susan are shamelessly abused as Ruth and her sons test the limits of Meg's resolve and her body. Soon other neighborhood children participate in the cruelty, and David cannot help but watch. He is a passive observer, never inflicting harm, but unable to put a stop to it. He is consumed by a morbid curiosity in addition to an overwhelming guilt that eventually puts him in Ruth's sites. Ruth's growing insanity and mental deterioration affect her own sons who succumb to the devious notions she presents to justify her treatment of Meg. Reader be warned: the descriptions of physical abuse are graphic and disturbing, but the novel is an interesting study of group mentality."
5,Great show,Love this show. The main characters are endearing and get into some crazy situations. This show keeps things a bit more realistic which is nice.
4,Love this show,"We love this show in our household, spy's like us! Female lead Annie is a great role model for teen girls!, ok maybe not the part where she sleeps with her asset, but she is smart, educated and confident in her abilities to get the job done! Joan too shows that woman are very able to succeed in male dominated career! You may not be able to have "" it all"", but you can come close! Also, that not all woman should or have to be mothers to be fulfilled in their lives!"
3,Won't get season 2 or 3...,"We got this because we love the ""Bourne"" series and ""White Collar"", but it didn't hold a candle to those shows. It the ""twists"" are too easy to read/predict. We will finish out the season to see if it gets better (watched 8 episodes already), but by then White Collar will be back on for the next season and we will go back to that."
3,"Piper is hot, she carries an otherwise dull show.","I suspect that when they cast Piper Perabo in this role they knew her appeal would salvage some listless story lines. Her placement in each scene is a bit too intentional, perhaps they rely too much on Piper. The show is a bit contrived and 'too sexy' for it's own good."
1,"Good idea, terrible acting","I was very disappointed by the quality of acting in this series. That said, I really enjoy being able to download an episode or two through video on demand and try out the series. Whew, saved me buying a series which I did not enjoy."
2,Creator of the Bourne Identity? You LIE!,"I remember when this show first came out. It looked promising, but the commercials had this guy I've never seen before talking about how he had always loved spy stories, and that was why he created the Bourne Identity. I thought 'I know what Robert Ludlum looks like, and that ain't him!' Apparently, the guy who created this show was the producer or something for the Bourne series of movies, and he either thinks that means he created the Bourne Identity or he wants us to think he did. I watched the first several episodes, and they weren't good enough to convince me to support an idiot or a liar (whichever he is), so I stopped watching it. Calling this show 'smart' is an insult to smart people. Piper Perabo is nice to look at, but I can't get past the fact that watching this show is a tacit endorsement of that liar on the commercials."
3,to much money,"This was a promising show, but please, these are hard times! when the price comes down I'll think about it."
2,White girl spy wearing white on a white box saving white people,"If you want to watch yet another show about a white person saving white people from mostly white people, this show is for you. I am so sick of seeing shows about white people I just want to throw color at the whiteness like Jackson Pollack. OK, this show is over dramatic, boring and has way to many white people. Many people say it's like Sex in the City with CIA agents, Thus it's BS. My father was CIA. This is BS with lots of white people."
5,New Flippin' Awesome Series,"This show really surprised me because when I saw the previews, I figured it would be another Alias or something. Actually, it's a smart and witty show filled with humor, sexual tension, a fun cast, and just an all together ""human"" look at the classic spy movie/show. I mean, here we get to see a more down-to-earth-not-just-a-mysterious-super-hero face of the CIA. The diversity of personalities isn't super new but it's still refreshing, especially Chris Gorham's character. He plays a blind, former ops agent and goodness he does it well! His chemistry with Piper Perabo is almost tangible! Overall, great series! I can't wait for more. The only thing that bugged me was that sometimes the video would freeze up a bit or go from HQ to LQ. That was my main annoyance. Otherwise, I'd rec this series to anyone looking for an addictively fun time!"
5,Covert Affairs Season 1,Great show! Love it! I would recommend this and the other seasons to anyone who likes spy stories about strong women.
4,Covet Affairs Exposed,"Covet Affairs is well written, well paced and just enough tension to keep it interesting. I would pay the annual fee if I could be sure all episodes are included in the price."
3,Was hoping for something like Homeland. But...,"Well, looks like I have to waste 20 words. It is cute but it lacks interesting plot lines. The acting is average. Watch it while reading the news online. You won't miss much."
3,I agree not realistic but fun,"The main characters are likable so I agree with Gary's post. However;Valerie Plame(former CIA), when younger probably was pretty attractive, since she is not bad looking now and she was the real deal(even has the blond hair). Your right though the show is not very realistic. I guess with all my shows on hiatus I used this as a filler since the main characters are likable. I just started to watch. Guess maybe we should ask Valerie how realistic it is(he he) or maybe covert affairs should have her on staff as consultant.(Just a thought). Either way like show so far despite its flaws."
4,cool spy show. that's getting better.,this is a short seasoned show like many on cable networks these days and it's doing quite well. The series is even better during it's second season by far though. Still this show the female characters to be well drawn out and doing the same jobs as men spies. that's progress! In fact that's reality and good for the ladies. The supporting cast is great too. The dvd set is worth getting used or cheaper than list price. It's got extras and lot more. The picture quality is fine too.
4,Cute Spy Drama,Only watched the first episode as it was free. I hope to buy the whole season soon to watch. I love crime scene dramas and action so I'm excited to find a Spy show with a female lead. The main character is new at the CIA and finding her way around with a blind man. Cute.
4,Piper Perabo delivers!,"This is the first episode of the series, thus it's the episode that introduces all of the characters to the viewer. It's a big change of roles for Piper Perabo compared to some of her earlier work (this is definitely not Coyote Ugly). To anyone who enjoys espionage movies or TV shows, you'll definitely enjoy Covert Affairs."
2,"B grade, try hard attempt at ""Alias""",Boring. The main charactor is who brings the show down.Totally unbelieveable actress. She was good in Cyote Ugly.No good in this. The blind guy is the only thingholding the show at 2 stars. his Great.Boring stories/script writters.This show proves how you can have good actrorsbut the show may be crap if the directors n writters are junk.boo
4,its good not great,"I bought an older model of this from somebody who son won it in a raffle, so it was basically new. I am a member of rails to trails and have ridden this on each sojourn every year, except one. 2 years ago we rode from DC to Pittsburgh, OUCH! this is a hardtail, the front suspension seemed soft to me, I changed the seat and added seat post suspension, not much help. folds easily, I live in a fifth floor walk up in NYC so that matters. If you really need a folding bike this is not a toy, If you really dont need a folder, get something with double suspension, your butt will thank you."
1,It's a waste of paper,"I expected a well written book (as someone recommended to me) but it is sprinkled with all kind of stuff I found to be straight obscene, that some people with a low self esteem might enjoy. There's no precise subject in this book, the author just circles around some happenings but her style is very confuse and ambigous, one can really image anything. I don't know why a decent publisher would finance a book like this."
1,"This is not the ""Alien"" series","Don't be misled: this is not the Sigourney Weaver ""Alien"" movies. It's a seven tape boxed set of cheesy 1950's and 60's black and white low budget sci-fi films that will only be of interest to someone who collections unknown films of this type. The acting, photography and editing are all third rate. The titles are: ""The Slime People"", ""The Arrival"", ""Alien Contamination"",""Creature"",""Star Knight"",""Abraxas"" and ""Day Of The Triffids"" with ""Triffids"" being the only one making it to second rate. Seriously, don't waste your money unless you are into this kind of film. Frank Zappa without a doubt wrote the song ""Cheepnis"" about these movies! :-)"
5,Great set!,"This is a must have for the Twin Time dollhouse! I really like all the little details with this set, that the refrigerator/freezer, dishwasher and oven open and close, the phone makes noises and the best thing of all is that the phone and baby spoon are connected to larger pieces so that they aren't so easily lost!"
1,Angery customer,"If what I had ordered had come to my house, I would not be hear. Take my money and send me the wrong product. So until I get this purchase made right, I will continue to write bad stuff. I have e-mailed you twice and you have not yet responded. So I'm trying this avenue."
5,Dollhouse,"Great dollhouse! My 2 year old (and our neighbors) plays with it all the time. This dollhouse was priced right, had a good selection of furniture to add to it and I had it delivered in two days, even with Free Super saver shipping! I'm very pleased with this purchase."
2,Rather loud and annoying to play with.,"I bought the Loving Family Dollhouse for my almost 4 year old twins for Christmas. This is one of the sets I bought them to go with it. After you press the oven button and it makes the bubbling noise, about 30 seconds after it is done making that noise, it makes the sound of a ringing phone. My kids were not really into all of the sounds, and I think that detered them from playing with it. The sounds are very loud, and you cannot distinguish between the stove sound, coffee brewing sound, etc.The oven does have a light that goes on when you open it up, but it too makes a loud beeping sound, like a timer going off.I think either some kids love it or hate it. Mine really didn't take to it, so I returned it for a kitchen that is wooden and makes no noise.I don't know why Fisher Price couldn't make this more muted, and maybe just one or 2 sounds. It could be overstimulating for some children."
2,"Dull, dull, dull",I bought this to share with my class to preview our King Arthur unit. It almost put me to sleep. Don't waste your money
5,Love this shoe,"Love Nina. Great brand. This shoe is elegant but ""light"" elegant at the same time due to the cork wedge. But certainly not casual. The quality is excellent. The fit for Nina tends to run a tad slim, but works for me. I'm incredibly pleased, especially with the price."
4,detail or no detail,"currently one of the better price/performance for a gps mapping device. noticed that the base device will show details in the usa for major streets but found that it did not show quite a few residential or smaller streets. interestingly enough on the exits the base device will actually list names of restaurants, stores, etc without use of any additional software. was missing features i found in other garmin devices like sunset/sunrise times, you are limited to tracking one route unlike other garmin devices. the base unit is not quite good enough to replace a thomas brothers guide"
3,A good basic unit,"This small unit is a great companion on long trips through unknown territory but don't expect it to do everything. Street level mapping is difficult if not impossible to decipher in dense,urban areas. But its great at providing exit info, including restaurants, gas stations, etc. Mapping software from Garmin is expensive and pretty primitive. Skip it unless you absolutely need street level mapping outside the built in base map."
2,CONFUSING USER MANUAL,"I regret to say that the instruction manual was so user unfriendly that I was unable understand how to make the unit perform simple functions such as entering route waypoints, etc. While not exactly a natural electronics whiz, I am also not technologically illiterate. I have a science-oriented masters, have spent 5 years using computers to plan search and rescue missions for the Coast Guard, and, being a military officer, am pretty good at following directions. Despite this, after two days of fiddling around, I could not even plan and execute a route from my home to work - perhaps my fault, perhaps the fault of a poorly designed user manual. Regardless, I decided to waste no more time. I wish to return this and get an APS camera instead.The idea of a hand-held GPS seemed pretty cool. When I get a chance I may look into trying another, hopefully easier to use model."
4,"LO LEI POR ""The Secret Life of the Words""","El libro es un poco depresivo, para aquellos que se identifiquen con la autora de estas cartas. Lei el libro porque vi la pelicula ""La vida secreta de las palabras"", escrita y dirigida por Isabel Coixet. Y a su vez, vi la pelicula por recomendacion de una chica especial... quien en definitiva, tiene cierta similitud con el soldado frances a quien le dirigen las cartas la monja portuguesa enamorada...Es interesante por la manera q se hace uso del lenguaje para describir un sentimiento tan hondo... uno se da cuenta como evolucionamos con el idioma (siendo cada vez mas sintetico y corto en belleza) pero no en los sentimientos... eso es lo que convierte al libro tan vigente y sea citado en una pelicula del 2005. Recomiendo que lo lean despues que vean la pelicula y no cuando esten esperando respuestas de la persona que aman."
5,Tiny-scaled acoustic perfection in a box,"Awesome sound these little babies shoot. No noticeable distortion when cranked at full volume, and the subwoofer is pretty powerful, specially at low and medium ranges. Great crystal-clear sound. These + a laptop/CD-MP3 player and a good CD/MP3 collection can be used as a great small-party sound system (i.e. hotel rooms or small activities where music is a must). Don't let the tiny size fool you, they sound even better than some bigger 4-speaker systems that I've seen.With this product, Boston Acoustics delivers... again and as usual."
4,Amazing for the price,"Hi, I had to write about these speakers. I have had the BA635 speakers for 3years on my gateway. Back then they were much more money. These speakers have very good high end and low end sound. They sound great for mp3's. The reason I gave these speakers four stars is because the base, is not the best in the world, but for people who want good quality speakers for music at a good price should by the BA635"
3,Depends on what you think is Mystical and Magical.,"Meav has a nice voice. This is not Celtic music by any definition I know, but I believe that in the US the word Celtic can be applied to anything at all. It isn't mystical, nor is it magical, but it is commercial and a little bland. Nice studying music! I also checked out Anuna as the reviewer below suggests, and I must admit that it is hard to believe that something as exotic and original as Anuna ended up as this kind of stuff."
3,Easy Listening,"This is very relaxing and nice cd to listen to. You will be pleased if you buy this album. Meav has a crystal clear voice that is just beautiful. I think Meav has more potential than she realizes. I think she is holding back on what she can really do with her voice. Meav reminds me of an earlier Sarah Brightman. Sarah was sweet and sang very carefully in her Webber years, but then she found something in her voice and it soared, and now is doing amazing and fun things with her career. I think the same could happen for Meav, I know she already is a success, but I think she can be even more if she lets her voice go even more. Just a thought."
2,Beware!!!! Clean can't find your burner.,"I bought Clean 4.0 and 4.1 and they have the same problem. When loading this software, Clean is supposed to find and configure your disc drives for reading and for burning. It usually always finds the ROM drive but finding the burner is a different story. Unlike it's sister software (included) Wave Lab Lite which enables you to choose whichever burner you wish, Clean might or might not find your burner. If it does find it, you're in business and it works flawlessly. Another problem is that Pinnacle nor Steinberg provide a download to correct this problem even though Clean has been out for a few years. How they could overlook this problem is beyond me. There is a Clean 5 (available in Europe only) but I am now afraid to invest any more money in this product. Until they print on the box that this problem has been corrected, BEWARE!!!."
4,UI is easy to learn,"I have tried numerous sound editor programs, such as Goldwave, CoolEdit Pro, Nero Wave Editor, and more. They all work well if you have the time to find each little click and pop and manually edit the noise. While the various filters do change the sound track or selections, I found that I didn't have the time to use these programs. I had been using my old Atari Falcon for A to D and editing, because of the simplicity of the software. Mr Steinberg, actually invented and patented much of the wave display and cursor control technology or User Interfaces that we enjoy in many of the sound editors on the market. This UI technology was available to the Atari community in the mid 1980's, then later to Mac users, and now to PC users. I think the Pinnacle/Steinberg Clean 4.0 software and the pre amp hardware is great. It is time to retire my Atari Falcon...Not!"
1,Incredibly poor product support,"I was never able to get the product to work. I tried the product support phone line. The phone line has the standard list of numeric choices... but doesn't let you enter a number midway through the list... you have to wait for the long list of products and choices to be read, even when you have called for the fourth time. The choices for this product lead to a dead end... the product is listed throught the first two levels of the menu, then disappears in the third level. The trail ends with no way to get to a human. The on-line listing of products supported does not list this product at the second level of menu, although it is in the first level."
4,Good enough,"Product itself is simple enough -- worth the price I paid for.The small screws that came with the product were too short for my sink; the longer screws were on the verge of being too long: judging from the ""dimples"" on the blocks after I tightened the screws, they look like they are just about to break through the plastic faucet block. (The screws screw in from underneath, through the sink's back edge, into the back side of the faucet block.)I'm glad I was able to find these on Amazon's market place. My local DIY store chain was supposed to carry this faucet block, but none of the stores had them on the shelves."
5,This Has Got to be One of her Best,"Who is JWC and how did the One Last Wish Foundation start? This one, amazing book answers all of your questions and more about JWC, the mysterious benefactor of the other One Last Wish novels. The past is revealed, as Jenny's story unfolds. Jenny is sixteen and has just been diagnosed with leukemia. Find out about her story. This is a must read for those who've read othet OWL books. Be sure to add it to your bookshelf."
5,"Touching and Romantic, A real tearjerker","Jenny is a normal girl, with a normal crush, on an older guy but this older guy also has a crush on her, but it's a hands off situation. Until Jenny gets cancer, this brings both their feelings into full blown rounds. Jenny wants to live, and hopes she will, but it comes down to living to the new year. Jenny feels lonely, feeling no one understands. And sees her trust fund will probably go to no good use, she oganizes the One Last Wish Foundation. The romance and hopes of this book just wrenched at my heart. Bring a box of tissues with you when you read it, and like everyone else, Hope"
5,This true story touched me for days.,"I thought that this book was extremely well written. I read it in one day; I was hooked. The story touched me and I found myself thinking of Jenny's life for days after. If you love romance and drama, then this is the perfect book for you."
4,A touching love story!,I quite enjoyed this book. I love sad books with a love story twisted in. I absolutly adored the ending! This was also one of my favorites by Lurene McDaniel. I have learnt a lot about cancer from these books.
5,A very excellent book,This a well written book. It explains how the Make A Wish FOundation was founded. This book is very heart-wrenchign and a real tear-jerker. I highly recommend it.
5,A tear-jerker not soon to be forgotten,This is one of the best and most emotional books I've ever read. Jenny's battle to live is a touching and romantic story that is impossible to forget.
2,Not too impressed,This cd was kind of a letdown. The songs were ok but not many songs stood out as great. I was expecting more with all of the now popular Disney stars but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
3,"Review etc, etc, etc....","The CD wasn't that good. It was pretty bad. The only song that were good was Two Worlds, When She Loved Me, and Go the Distance (probably everyone agrees with that)..... Anyway the rest of the songs were horrible. Completely horrible."
1,A Kids Review on there Mother's Name,"I'm on my Mom's Amazon Account just to say my review for this CD. I don't have it, but I have all the songs on my Ipod that I like from it. Here's my ratings-Go The Distance- This freakin rocked so much. It's so emotional and beautiful!Color's Of The Wind- Techno sounds, love it!Find yourself- great.Two worlds- Nice.Part Of Your World- Liked the beat.Kiss The Girl- I love this Pop Rendition!True to your heart- cool.blah blah blah. I can't remember the rest only because I don't really like the rest so over all this CD was amazing!!!!!!"
3,You have to understand disneymania,"The very first disneymania i ever heard was the first one. I thought it was so stupid, they were ruining classic songs that i loved. My best friend turned me onto the version of kiss the girl by no secrets and soon it became like our theme song, i loved it but i still loved the orginial. Disneymania is when artists take their favorite songs and make them unique, i have to say i liked a lot of this disneymania but my favorite songs are the ones that i had no attachment too. For instance i liked the second start to the right version but i don't really listen to the orginal. THese songs are rock-y and pop-y and not classic disney if thats what you are looking for then this isn't for it. This is something different and upbeat and its worth a try. Its all just for fun"
5,Love Lisa,"Celtic Women are a lovely group and Lisa has an especially beautiful voice. I loved her song ""Send me a Song"" from their ""Cletic Woman"" cd and wanted to hear more of her. I was not disappointed!! It is just a wonderful cd, you will love it!!"
5,what a voice !,"have seen one of Celtic Woman's shows on DVD and without a doubt, it was quite impressive ; the songs and the singing were undescribable, other than just lay down and let it take you places. Amongst the voices, Lisa's stood out, in my opinion, as the most remarkable, and this CD has just reconfirmed this. Very good buy for those who can appreciate good music."
3,"pretty voice, but thought it was instrumental","Well, I did a dumb thing! I bought this album because I loved the song from 'Gladiator', ""We are Free"" that is on this album. I was hoping the rest of the album would be like this, but I was wrong. Should have checked it out fuller. She has a beautiful voice but it wasn't what I was looking for..."
1,Lisa (Celtic Women Solo artist),The music on this is lovely. Lisa's voice is one of my favorite from the Celtic Women group. Anyone who loves Irish music will love this CD.
3,Terrific Singer,"Lisa has an amazing voice. If you enjoyed Celtic Women, you would likely enjoy this. Some of the songs are rehashed from prior recordings, but that doesn't detract from the quality. ""May it Be"" is worth buying the CD."
4,Lisa Kelly of Celtic Woman,"Lisa is a great performer, of the Celtic Woman group she probably has more experience than the other performers of the group. She has also appeared on stage in several shows. She performs the song ""May it Be"" as well as any one I have heard sing the song and maybe as well as Enya!"
4,pure joy!,"Lisa is my favorite Celtic Woman so this is a real treat to have her singing all the songs. This is a CD that I use to unwind & relax. Just sit back, close my eyes & drift away on the lovely sound of her wonderful voice. Love it."
5,OUTSTANDING!,I have had the pleasure of meeting Lisa. She is a beautiful person. Her voice is angelic. The song selection on this CD is great. I would recommend this CD highly. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY CELTIC WOMAN FAN.
5,The most purest voic ever heard by mortal beings.,"I own this cd and cannot get enough of it. Lisa has a way of singing so intimately to her audiance. I love her and this album and all the Celtic Woman artist. Saw them in Philadelphia and would suggest to all to support them for their talents are heavenly sent for sure. Lisa with deepest appreciation I will await your future and gift to us in song and support it. Love, Dennis K. Yates of Mount Joy, Pa."
4,a classic,great album. cliffys last in the huntingtons. recommend to anyone who likes ramoes style punk. these guys were the masters.
1,Elston Gunnn????? Who's jiving whom?????,"Elston Gunnn was one of the original aliases of famed Bob Dylan. I've not listened to any of the CD advertised herein, but I'm highly suspicious of the inferred title/artist of the CD. Hmmmm.......Like a Rolling Stone????? NOT!!!!!"
1,The worst Cadillac Book EVER,"I love Cadillacs, but this book does not do them justice. The people who put this book together can't even identify them. Several photos are mis-named, for example, most of the time the captions for 1958 Cadillacs read that they are 1957 cadillacs (Come on guys) and other captions are very generic becuase I assume they couldnt identify the years. Oh, and get this one... They have a section with star's cars, and they talk about how Elvis gave out caddys left and right, but the photo shown is of Elvis leaning against a Chrysler Imperial, even the Imperial name is spelled out and the editors didnt catch this? Don't tell me they dont know a Caddy from a Mopar. Also several of the photos show beauty shots of hood ornaments and a bunch are shiney, but pitted. Couldnt they have found a rechromed sample? This book is put together very poorly. It is a real waste."
3,The devil is in the detail,"This book is one of the few to celebrate the first 100 years of Cadillac. Text is ok, pictures are lavish and big-sized. There are a number of flaws in the pictures like misspelling the modelyear (or not even mentioning it) and Elvis leaning against an Imperial. On the other hand the format on the book is good, the pictures are great (although a lot of them have been published before) and for a real Cadillac enthousiast like me it was still worthwhile ordering it. But a little more care for the detail would have been appreciated."
1,not worth the expense,"This is my third Bunn coffee maker that has leaked. The only solution that Bunn offers is to return it and they will send a rufurbished unit. With the cost of shipping it back, it is about the same as buying a brand new one. I was a loyal Bunn customer, but this is my last Bunn coffee maker. Save your money and get something that will hold up better."
4,"One Piece: Season Four, Voyage One",good season wird turn can't wait to see the end of the fight between luffie and foxy then to meet the new crew mate bring on october and the next dvd
3,Wait or Buy,"Now I am at a delema first I am thrilled that the U.S. is getting on the ball for dubbing one piece and really want to find out what happens but with the One Piece collections that come out like ever three months it won't be long before they catch up to this Season Four, Voyage one. In fact they might be on episode 207 by collection volume 10 or eleven and the 8 comes out about a month or two so should one wait and or buy this one just to be same. I'm just not sure"
1,I can't believe this book got published,"This book was poorly written. If anyone other than a best-selling romance writer were to submit this story to a publishing house, it would be immediately rejected. The writing is so poor and the story line is so stupid that it seems to me that this book was only written to meet some type of deadline that Jude Devereaux must have had to meet. I have read other books by her in the past but I will not waste my money (or time) on any more of them in the future."
1,UUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"JUDE!WHAT HAPPENED! You have written some pretty wonderful books (ie The Raider, The Princess) but this one was a stinker. The hero and heroine had about as much depth as a bag of potato chips, the man was to old, and the kid was a spoiled brat. Worst of all though was the notion that anyone could possibly be desperate enough for love that they would tell the heroine that their competitor(and brother mind you) is gay. Come on, I mean where did that come from. Next time Jude stick with the Historicals. You write some pretty awesome ones."
1,This book is a stinker!,"For anyone who is a Devereaux fan - avoid this book! The storyline is weak, the characters have no depth and for the most part aren't even likeable. This is by far the worst book I've read in a long time."
4,"Lighthearted, warm, humorous, entertaining","My first Jude Deveraux book. I picked it up because of the title and because I was intrigued by the picture on the cover, being a fairly new mom myself. It was pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Light but not ""brain dead""! The dialogue was good, often funny, and it came naturally to picture everything because it reads and flows so easily. I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down. I will definitely look into reading another one!"
2,I guess it was okay,"But it definitely wasn't the reason I've been buying Jude Deveraux's books for the past 15 years. It's as if she expects us to identify with her type of heroine and hero so strongly that she doesn't actually have to develop the characters--but that just doesn't work. No one seems realistic or compelling. And here's my question about the plot--if David wanted his brother to take care of Amy's baby so that David could date Amy, how come he didn't seem to spend any time with her?"
1,Simply Awful!,"I have to agree with Flo Nightengale: This might be the very worst romance that I have ever read. I finally gave up on it about halfway through, thinking, ""This must be a satire/farce on Harlequin Romances!"" It had all the cliche bits from those novels: rich guy, poor girl with no talents, overblown wealth, bratty kid. Ugh. I have enjoyed other romances by Jude Deveraux, and this one is certainly not up to her standard. Read something else!"
1,A big disappointment.,Characters lack strength or depth that Deveraux readers have grown accustomed to in the past. Weak story line as well. Totally disappointed for the first time.
2,"And I'm being generous with 2 stars, should be 1.5","Here is a warning: Do not read this book, it's horrible. The entire time I was reading THE BLESSING, I was wanting it to be over. It was so bad that I don't even remember what it was about."
1,Silly Unbelievable plot,This book makes no sense. If a man was interested in someone would he really ask his rich handsome older brother to stay with the woman? I'd say he'd take the offer of his brother's secretary immediately and keep the brother way away from her. A three year old has the patience and strength and talent to paint an entire room as well as depicted in this book? Come on!
3,Not a Bad Read,"The book had too much fanasy for me. A woman in her right mind would never have allowed a stranger to move into her house and often be given the sole responsiblity for an infant child. David showed extreme immaturity in the way he went about arranging""private time"" with the women he claimed to love and wanted to marry.He also hated the child who was only 6 months old.After I made myself realize it was just a book and not real life, I found the story very touching and began to enjoy reading the book. It has a wonderful ending but I thought the outcome would never come together."
2,Improbable development of baby Max,"Good story line. However the writer doesn't know the development of a 6 month old. At that age they just start solids such as rice cereal, no way can they eat table food. Also Max , the baby, goes from 2 teeth to 4 teeth in 2 days. Its hard to believe a 3 year old can do a wall mural that was artistically good."
1,Just About the Worst Romance I've Read,"Seriously disappointed in one of my favorite authors. Completely flat - from character, to setting, to romance. Utterly and completely flat. The premise wasn't bad - but the whole story was rushed so much, the plot becomming more and more contrived, with no suspense and no empathy for the characters... I just can't tell you how disappointed I am in Jude Deveraux. Maybe she was just having a bad day or two (it couldn't have taken her longer than that to write.)"
2,Departure from her usual style,"After reading it, i find it disappointing. First, the book wasn't in her usual length. It has a feel that many parts seemed underdeveloped.Most annoying of all was the various bramd names that keep popping up, not that i have somthing against them, but the frequency those names appear make the book sound a mite materialistic.(Hey! it is a romance novel!)In the end, the whole book sounded like an advertisement for the American Express Platinium Card. Well,lets hope that the next novel from the author wouldn't be this way."
4,I enjoyed this book,"This is the only Jude Deveraux book I've read so far. I really enjoyed it, finishing it in about 5 hours. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. I was glad when Jason started realizing that he wasn't as wonderful as he thought he was. I found the characters believable. (Well, okay, the kind of man Jason was in the beginning never would have given in to his little brother and baby-sat for a week. But the rest of it was believable.) All in all, a good read, full of humor, lessons, and easy to read."
4,A must read!,"I was never a fan of Jude Deveraux but I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I think it is certainly one of the best that I have read out of everything else that she has written. I didn't like her Montgomery series and etc. I thought those were too dry and too old fashioned, about helpless damsel in distress waiting for chauvnistic male to rescue them. It was too redundant. However, the Blessing is filled with humors, laughters, wonderful characters, and very realistic. I liked the fact that Amy is strong and independent and also that Jason isn't afraid to show his vulnerability. It made the characters real and relateable. I enjoyed this book very much. It was worth buying and definitely a keeper for me."
1,An all-around disappointment,"""The Blessing"" does not exhibit the eloquent storytelling, humor, drama, and excitement found in the many wonderful books she has written. The story is weak and undeveloped, without any depth. The characters are one dimensional and there is nothing that makes the reader truly care about what happens to the hero & heroine. I found it difficult to finish."
2,okay,"The Blessing was disappointing when compared to Ms. Devereaux previous works. I actually had to put it down halfway into it, I was so disappointed. A couple weeks later I finished it out of sheer obligation. It wasn't horrible, it was just not what I was expecting. I understand that there are always a couple of books that don't mesh well with a reader and that was mine. I will continue to read her books though because usually they are 5 stars. :o)"
2,Not worth the price,"When I read the synopsis of this story, I thought it sounded interesting, and the cover art looked good. Was I disappointed! The dialogue was simplistic, and the story ended up annoying me. Don't waste your money or your time on this book. (That saddens me as I usually love Ms. Deveraux's stories...)"
2,Very Dissapointing!,"I love Ms. Deveraux writting, but in this one she must have been somewhere else in her mind when she was writting it. The story was very unrealistic and the characters were, well... BLAH! that the best way for me to describe them. There were some scenes that reminded me why some her other books did so well, but overall I did not like THIS book."
3,Not Too Bad,"I thought that this book was mildly entertaining, but I would have to agree with the other reviewer who said that the romantic, ""day-dreamy"" feeling was just not there. Jude Devereaux is one of the better romance writers, but this is not one of her better books."
2,"It's a little better, but still not the Jude Deveraux I love","I agree totally with ""reader from Westborough, MA USA , November 20, 1998"". Sweet Liar was sooo good. I really really miss her old books' style. It's a good light reading, but didn't make much impression on me."
2,wait for the paperback,I have been a Deveraux fan for a long time. This book is not one of her best. It is a light read and worth reading after you've finished those other books you've been anxiously waiting to read. Maybe Ms. Deveraux needs to take a break so she can revitalize her writing. Her last couple of books have been an unfortunate disappointment. I will not be purchasing another hardcover Deveraux for some time.
2,Better than her last few novels,"I bought this book expecting not to like it. I feel she hasn't written a a decent novel since Sweet Liar. The story, well, it isn't Jude's best. In a good Jude Deveraux novel, you know that she had as much fun writing it as we readers do reading it. The Blessing had a glimmer of the old Jude Deveraux fun. For that it is worth the read."
3,an unusual regency you'll either like or hate...,"this is a very unusual regency because it has a definate mythical and paranormal slant to it. Since I also read paranormal romance I had no problem with it BUT if you are a dyed in the wool regency traditionalist then you will probably not enjoy this book.Overall, I'd give it a 3 because it was somewhat exciting and the romance was good. If I was specifically judging it on continuity, plot holes and such, I'd give it a 1 because the storyline does have some big plot holes, info just left out, no explaintion of how or why the characters have these mystical abilities, and what explaination given was hard to follow.If you are looking for galas, and balls, the fun of the regency era thru the ""ton""-you won't find it here. If you are open to something different I'd recommend this book but I'd suggest buying it used.3 stars."
5,Can't get enough!,I am very picky when it comes to scented body wash and lotion. This stuff smells amazing! I finally find a product I love and then find out it has been discontinued. :( I am buying up every tube I can find. I love it and cannot get enough!
2,"way too much orange, not enough pachouli","i got this as a christmas gift after adding it to my wishlist. unfortunately, i have used it only a handful of times because i just cant get over the sweet, sweet smell of the orange and the lack of pachouli scent. the orange almost smells like its fake and is akin to canned mandarin oranges (as strange as that is, its the only way i can describe it). i like a more natural, citrus-like orange scent and a stronger pachouli scent. i feel that this product really misses the mark when it comes to anything organic smelling."
3,Fair portrayal of a much maligned General,"This book is plainly baised toward its subject, Sir John French, and is very much like an official biography. However, it does has its merits in showing that French was not the bloodthirsty, uncaring, blundering stereotype as exemplified by his more infamous contemprorary, Douglas Haig. In the book French was seen to be much depressed by the casaulties of war, and unfairly intrigued against by a whole bunch of unsavoury characters behind his back, like Kitchener, Ian Hamilton,. Haig, Robertson and other assorted incompetents who tried, only too successfully, to blame French for all that was wrong with the BEF.We are also told of the semi mutiny of the British Army in Ireland as a result of Home Rule,though French's scamdalous private life and his many flirtings outside of marriage are not touched on.Definitely a much better and balanced biography than the ridiculous one on Haig by John Terraine."
2,Another Half Season Rip-Off for fans.,"I love the Cannon series and William Conrad, but hate these half season ""volume"" sets. Just another way for the studio to rip-off fans by hitting them twice in the wallet. I refuse to buy them new. I wait for re-sales of nice used sets in the secondary market. These CBS half season sets sell for the price of other studios full season releases of other TV series from the same era. Just no other way to see a reason for it except that the studio wants to hit your pocket twice. What a shame for fans of these classis shows."
3,Careful - Misprinted copies!,"As others have said in their reviews, the Utah Symphony Orchestra does a good job, but does not overwhelm the listener with passion. Overall, a good buy to get all the symphonies in one collection.HOWEVER, it seems that at least one release of this set contains a misprint where Disc 1 is actually another artist and genre altogether! My disc 1 is some sort of Gospel CD, and even looking it up in the CCDB database didn't turn up the artist or title. Perhaps Amazon will replace your copy if you have one of the misprints, but VOXBOX will NOT. So buy with care."
3,HELP,"I brought this System a few years ago. Since then, I lost the remote. I can't seem to get the radio to work without the remote. I can't preset the radio stations of my choice. Is there any way to get this system to work without the remote?"
2,Average,Well it didnt have HDMI and the remote is pretty bad and the disc changer is awful. The sound quality was ok but i dont believe Sony's dubious clame of 143 watts a channel or the 285 for the sub.
2,Not like the picture,"The ball I received is a 32 panel ball, the ball in the picture is a 14 panel ball. There is quite a difference in the shape retension and handling performance between the two. Not to mention I could have saved myself shipping charges by just buying the ball I received at a local sporting goods store."
3,Alta Calidad de fotos con mucha Luz,"Esta camara es muy buena para amateurs - la calidad de las fotos es alta de día o en ambientes cerrados con buena iluminación - el problema es cuando tomas fotos de noche o en lugares con poco iluminación, la foto no tiene buena resolución y por ende poca nitidez. El otro drawback es el doble flash - cuando predeterminas para que la camara utilice el doble flash, estas salen movidas y no hay manera de corregir este problema.Pero en general es una buena camara y por el precio es muy recomendable."
3,Okay for beginners,"I bought this camera for my fiance for Christmas so we could take it on our honeymoon in January. The pictures turned out pretty well. They aren't the sharpest pictures but they are at least as good as (if not sharper) than 35mm pictures.The viewing screen is impossible to see in the dark, you just have to point and shoot and hope for the best. Most people don't know how to use digital cameras yet so when asking someone to take a pic of us, we got our heads chopped off many times.This wouldn't be a bad camera for a beginner or a casual picture taker."
5,perfect for a beginner,"pros: small but powerful, good image quality, easy to use menu, nice software and computer interface.cons: no preview window, no carrying case."
4,Great Entry-Level Digital Camera,"Easy to use - I haven't even opened the Owner's Manual, yet (probably should do that sometime)! For those wanting a simple camera that takes great pictures, this is the camera for you. Great, small size plus features of many far more expensive cameras make this a great choice for those just getting into the market for a digital camera. I do a lot of digital work for the web and this camera suffices for everything I need."
3,Lack of viewfinder a downer; battery life is lousy,"The Coolpix 2000 is a easy-to-use digital camera with two important features: 3x optical zoom and great picture quality. However, it lacks an optical viewfinder, so you must use the LCD screen to shoot pictures -- which is awkward and annoying. I thought this problem was gone on all but the cheapest DCs. Guess not. Also, the CompactFlash memory card is hard to remove. Another problem is that the path to deleting photos is a little confusing at first. Be FOREWARNED: Battery life is the worst I've ever seen, and this is the third digital camera I'ved owned and about the sixth or seventh that I've operated on a regular basis. It's a good camera to keep in the car for emergencies or to use for work. If you're serious about digital photograpy, though, spend a little extra on a [more expensive camera]. You'll be happy you did. My wife owns a 2300 and I bought this, so I'm a bit disappointed."
4,Good but needs improvement,This works great and makes a nice clean panel line BUT it would be perfect if it had a thinner blade on the other end for smaller scale work. It will work OK with 1/24 scale stuff but way to big for anything smaller. Something along the lines of the width of a #11 blade would be great!
4,Good movie,"Great information, just a little slow for the children, especially boys. But it has wonderful religious info for children to learn."
4,Great Cartoon,At first I was not fond of purchasing a cartoon. However the message is great. I will show this one to my nephews.
5,The Greatest Miracle,Very interesting presentation. It was very different than i expected. I intend to loan it to other people both young and old to refresh their understanding of this mystery of Faith.
5,A unique movie topic not duplicated anywhere else,"My family and I don't go to see many movies at the theater... but we made an exception for this movie and we're SO glad that we did! This movie is very unique in that the focus is on the Mass and Confession and their significance in the lives of different people. The movie teaches while it entertains. Although a CGI movie, the topics and characters are 100% realistic and are relevant for every member of the family. It completely held my children's attention (ages 5 and 3 at the time) and had sentimental/touchy moments for my wife and I as well.It was a great movie for the whole family and we've been anxiously waiting for the DVD release ever since we saw it on the big screen. Looks like it'll be available in time for the holidays this year. I know this will be one item the children will be receiving this Christmas and your children would love to receive it too!"
2,Praying for souls,"The women are dressed inappropriately and act to hookerish for children. I would love a good movie on the Holy Mass for children, but this I would not be able to show 1st grade ccd children."
4,"Scenes from ""The Big Picture""","This set is a collection of installments of the old black and white TV show ""The Big Picture."" They've been edited to remove the segments with the hosts of the show and it's just the combat footage. Thankfully the original narration is on these discs."
1,Let Sleeping Vets Lie,"BEWARE, I purchased this series thinking they were a continuation of James Heriot's first four but to my disapointment the publisher riped off the public by reprinted the original stories under a new title. I tryed to return them but gave up and donated them to the local library"
1,Waste of Money,"Give me a break! If these people were such wondeful writers, they wouldn;t be writing such horrible movies. And who wants to look at their ugly faces?"
2,So-so,This book had the information but the way it was worded was way to heavy and serious for the age group it is aimed at. They seemed to be trying too hard to sound grown up and knowlegable and just ended up making sex a boring topic.
4,Cool Words Tween Ready Bed Review,"The bed is great and easy to use. The cool words were a bit deceptive though. I wouldn't call them cool words and neither would my daughter. The picture of the cool words ready bed on the web site makes it hard to tell what the words are and there is not a description of what the words are either. When we received the product we were disappointed. The words were ""girl punk, trouble maker, supafreak and rebel without a cause"". We would not have bought it knowing it said those words, but unfortunately we were in a hurry and needed it right away since we were about to do some traveling. Other than the uncool words my daughter said this it was comfortable."
1,the casualties look like selma blair's butthole,".......................................................................popped it in the cd player and I just couldn't stop dancing. At first I threw a bucket on my head cause I thought it was Devo, and everybody knows that ... rocks. Then I heard the second song and noticed that the singer was different than Devos, so I came to conclusion that all their songs are really Devo covers. Thus the casualties are a Devo cover band incognito. So if you dress like a poliwag and spike you hair in cool eighties flourescent colors start changing your style babe, cause punk is deader than ........P.S. Barba streisand looks good in your dads clothing."
2,Awful,"Casualties are an awful band, they have tried and failed to copy older punk bands. They have lots of energy but little style to carry it. If this is the style of music you're after, there are a lot of bands can do it a lot better for you and look better whilst doing it. Check out Conflict, Exploited, GBH etc. Try hard to avoid wasting money on Casualties albums, there isn't a good one to buy (and this is supposed to be their best!). I give them two stars for energy but nothing for quality."
5,One of the best punk albums ever made,"And it sounds like complete ****, like punk is supposed to. Raw, and powerful, this is by far the best album the Casualties have ever produced. After hearing this album, I can't listen to the re-recorded versions of these songs any more."
5,"Great Product, Lightweight, powerful","This unit is easy to set up, just attach the blower tube. Started easily and quickly - just follow the directions. Unit is very lightweight and powerful. I've owned several gas blowers and this is one of the best ones I've owned. I'd highly recommend this unit if you want something easy to use, powerful, and lightweight."
2,No Longer supported by company,"This blower worked great for several months. Perfect for the driveway, etc. Then the pull-start broke. I searched on-line for the parts (it's a simple fix), only to find that they are no longer available. I called Troy-Bilt directly. They have switched manufacturers (in Mexico), and can no longer get parts for this unit. Stay away!!!!"
1,Service center can't get parts.,"I purchased leaf blower and it worked well until the 3rd tank of fuel. The starter assembly broke and I was no longer able to start the unit. Blower was taken to an authorized service center for repair on March 13, 2007 and the unit is still there as of May 3, 2007. The service center cannot get the needed $3.00 replacement part. It is summer and I need the blower. Troy-Bilt must not be interested in repeat business. Buy another brand as the warranty is no good without the availability of replacement parts. **Update** I got my blower back on 05/29/07. It was down from 03/13/07 until 05/29/07. Can you do without your equipment that long during the mowing season? Do yourself a favor and consider another brand."
4,Pleased,"I was very pleased with the product. Easy to start and lightweight. My only complaint is the vibration of the blower. For the cost, it is a good blower for it's size/cost."
3,Surprisingly powerful BUT!!!,"The Troy Bilt tb250b has surprisingly strong velocity for a small light weight blower. The other surprise is that Troy hasn't adapted to the easy pull start system , that virtually every other 2 cycle product has. This blower is very hard to start"
1,Great and BROKE!,"Easy to handle, easy to start, did maintenance on it always - almost brand new still. Great powerhouse...., except the ""Starter latches"" (Plastic) on the pull rope that engages the engine to start it- BOKE !!! -they are PLASTIC! NO REPLACEMENT at all, heading to garbage pile due to poorly planned and built - rest of unit is in great working order. But USELESS!"
3,Mostly harmless,"It is fussy about having fresh gas - won't start on fuel that runs fine in my other 2-stroke machines. Also, the speed knob vibrated off and was lost the first time I used it, and the starter rope broke the third time I used it. It blows leaves just fine if you can get it going."
5,Sauna Therapy,"This book is a must for any person wanting to be at their optimum health. I have always been healthy, I fast, do colonics 3 times a week, taken out my mercury fillings, eat all organic, and yet I know from what this book tells me, I still have more toxins and heavy metals that will easily be removed by sauna therapy. Money well spent and am excited to have a chance to reverse the aging process. Sherry"
3,Nice but nothing special,"This is a nice scent but not, to me, as it was described -- this fragrance is just a simple gardenia scent. That's all it smelled like to me. But I do get compliments when I wear it."
3,Not Compatible,"This is a GREAT keyboard. Easy to read and a nice touch. However, after talking at length with Philip.com I learned that this keyboard hasn't been manufactured in over 5 years and is not compatible with Vista or Windows 7."
5,A GREAT Game......BUT.......,THis really is a game that makes one think and act on knowledge as much as brawn. If you enjoyed Theif 2 or System shock then you are in for something FAR deeper than those games combined.BUT.......be warned...this game does not run well on systems not useing Voodoo based graphics cards. You need to really run this in Glide...Direct 3d makes it very unstable. If you can't get a good framerate this game is IMPOSSIBLE to play.Be warned.
5,Best all around game I've found,"I'm not sure where to start...You can approach missions different ways, from being a savvy, stealthy agent to being a head-on firefight warrior. You can interact with all the characters along the way, sometimes gaining needed knowledge only after the 3rd time you initiate conversation.There are points in the game where you have to make choices...Trust your brother, or your agency. Rule the world, or destroy technology and send everyone back to the stone ages. And the game relates to real world history, real-world places. I've never played a game through more than once, but I did for this game several times. And I found new things each time I played.I enjoyed Doom, Duke Nukem, Quake, Red Faction (recently), but none of them measure up to Deus Ex."
5,This game is awesome,"I just got this game yesterday, and have to say it is the best game I have played in a long time. It is a futuristic first person shooter crossed with a role playing game, and it is awesome. Just make sure you have a top end system, and a good video card."
4,"Great Game, just a flaw or two","First off, this is an excellent game. Make no mistake, this action/RPG is the best one out there, ranking up by System Shock and others. You get upgrades, experience points to work out skills. It may seem tricky at first, but once you get used to it, it's awesome. The voices are great, and they lip-sync in for the ultimate realism. The plot is very well done, but there seems to be a problem with the visuals. See, if you don't have the 3D card the game works best on, you'll majorly have to tone down graphics like I did. Make no mistake, if you have a Voodoo, you're alright, but anything else, like for me a NVidia Riva 128, you need to turn detail down. Of course, this doesn't detract from the game, and after all, if you're only after the game for good graphics, you need to rethink your purchases. If you like sci-fi, conspiracies, System Shock or Thief, this is an imperative purchase."
5,Good Combination of Popular Games,"Deus Ex is one heck of an awesome game. It's like a combination or Soldier of Fortune with Thief: The Dark project. A player can hide in the shadows and snipe at his enemies or run up behind an enemy and take him out. You can also pick up an enemy's body so that other enemy forces won't see the body. You can also search dead bodies for weapons,ammos, etc. It's a great game, though it does not have Soldier of Fortune style violence, it is still violent and fun to play."
4,Great game with some minor flaws...,"Deus Ex...one of those rare gems that help define a genre. Sure, the graphics are dated (even when the game first came out, it was already behind the times). But what the game didn't have in ""gee-whiz"" graphics, it more than made up for in the ""I'm-going-to-stay-up-until-5am-in-the-morning-because-I-want-to-see-what-happens-next."" area. In other words, this game has a plot *so* thick, you could practically touch it.PLEASE NOTE: I've tried to push this game on a lot of people. Something I've noticed is that some people quit the game during the first/second mission because the game has a rather slow pace in the beginning."
5,This is one of THE BESTgames I have ever played!,"This game has everything. It is unlike any first person shooter game that has ever been created. in this game you can train in what you want to do. You can train in sniping and shoot people from far away, you can train in rifling and shoot crowds of people with assault rifles or fully automatic shotguns, you can blow stuff up with demolitions training, you can get training in hacking and take down security systems and break into ATM machines, you can learn electronics and break doorcodes or turn off autoguns. In this game, anything is possible, you do what you want to do, you beat the missions the way you want to do it. And another thing I like about this game is the augmentations you can get. You can get things that enhance your sight, accuracy, strength, stealth, and you can even cloak yourself. So please dont hesitate to get this game. You will definetly not regret it."
1,"One star, not that I got to play it......","Now taking into account most people have a more sensible system than I do, I have to say that this is so far a very disappointing product. I have a new Sony with an AMD Athlon processor, 1 Ghz and 128 meg of ram. I may need to install a Voodoo card to play this game, and I just might do that. I have an SiS graphics card which does not handle the game well at all. On using software rendering, I get the best result: smooth and precise with no jerking and instant updating. However, after several seconds the game always locks up. This game also has the longest loading times of any game I have ever played. This is a shame because it looks very promising. Perhaps I will post an updated review if I ever get to play the sodding thing."
1,"Eidos, it's the 21st century!","Well, I'd really like to play this game. But since Eidos is still developing games for last century's operating systems, I have been denied the pleasure. Games like Half Life and Diablo play quite nicely on NT and 2000 Professional (21st century operating systems). Check the date, Eidos, and get with it."
5,Bryan Eastin,"Deus Ex ought to win the prophetic game of the century award. It was published back in 1999 when nobody talked about terrorists or abuses of the constitution or sacrificing freedom for safety, yet there are so many parallels with what's happened recently that it's almost spooky to play the game.I don't generally like first person shooters, but this game is awesome. You can play like a commando, a hacker, or a thief. The plot is smooth and side quests are plentiful and generally fit in well.Get this game."
3,Poor A.I.,"Everything about this game is great except the artificial intelligence. At least in Unreal (same engine)the enemies did flips and tricks. Here the soldiers often get stuck, ping pong back and forth in a very low tech (ancient tech) way. Then, all at once they turn into superman and become hyper-agile and quick. Then you die. Oh well, it doesn't happen so often that I advise not to buy this game. It is way cool, but the A.I is weak."
5,Inmensively inmersive,"I had read a magazine's article about this game in which it said that this was a very good game, at first I didn't believe it. But when I got this game bundled with my sound card I got inmediately sucked by it.At first glance, this game may look like a lousy copy of Metal Gear Solid, but don't be decieved! it has more than enough elements to stand on its own. The plot is very inmersive and add that to the richly detailed levels and you'll understand why it's so adictive; best of all, you'll never find yourself stuck and unable to go foward for there's ALWAYS more than one way to complete your objectives. The music is equaly good it keeps the tension on and on, and there's a lot of intrigue and paranoia during the game if you check the emails ar read the computer's advices, add that to the ability to customize your character in skills and augmentations, and you have a game that will fill every die-hard player."
4,Great game... but it will lock up,"It's to bad too. The game is awesome, plot,grafics and twists are second to none,but very unstable and the manufactuer is not willing to help."
3,"Solid,yet nothing special","The good points to this game are the way the storyline is played out. It is a good game with solid gameplay and if you are a first person shooter fan, I would say it is worth the money. The downsides are it uses the outdated ""Unreal"" game engine and I would have to say the graphics are unimpressive with a noticeable slowdown in framerates when alot of textures are displayed or when you look over ""long"" distances. The enemys seem to die easier hitting them with a crowbar than shooting them with a shotgun or rifle. I just run around half the time wacking away with my crowbar. Many times it takes 2 clips of ammo to put someone down. All in all, a good play with nothing great to offer."
2,Not that great,"First of all, let me say this game is good. So why do I only see 2 stars, you say? To begin, saving and loading times are insane. While if you're not playing on Glide, forget this game. You'll never run it and have fun. Also, the enemy is so stinkin' stupid. You can crawl in front of them, and they'll say something like,""I think I heard something. As long as you move behind something in a second or two, he'll think it was nothing and move along. You were right in front of him, for crying out loud! I don't want to give it away, but the storyline is great. That's about the only good thing this game has to offer. Voice acting is hideous. JC Denton, which is you, is just a monotone scratchy voice act. It stinks! So much cool stuff is being thrown at you and the voices that do it are so boring they're going to sound like your boss or teacher, no lies. Bottom Line: Get this if you like RPGs or FPS but don't mind slowdowns."
2,Godawful,"This game comes complete with 1) a really stupid background story, and 2) gameplay that equals ""run around and kill things while waiting for the game to feed you another clue"". The attempt at future noir is half-baked, the character models are drab, and the in-game cutscenes are horrible and embarrassing. Typical computer world populated by about 30 people."
3,There are many better games out there,"This kind of game has been done to death. There is nothing original here, the graphics arent that great, the game play is sloppy and the cut scenes are less than impressive. Words of wisdom, save your money."
3,Coin Vault,"The coin vault really does its job. Rarely does it stick, but at times it can. The feature that is really nice is the one touch automatic front opener. It sorta looks like a miniature highrise. The only downfall is that it is run by batteries alone, it would be nice to have the capability of using an ac adapter. Overall, this is a nice way of keeping your change in one spot and organized."
2,It works but---,"Frequent jams, batteries don't last very long, if you want accuracy you must dump the coins out of the plastic sleeve and count them before you put them in the paper sleeve. Not for large sorting jobs."
4,Great coin sorter!,"So far I like everything about this sorter. I haven't had a single jam and I like that the drawer that holds the coins holds in tightly. I had another that would move slightly with the vibration of the machine giving the coins an opportunity to slip into inbetween spaces causing jamming problems. I live that there is a manual and motorized way to open the drawer. The coin holder on the top could be bigger. There is a light over the coin drawer so you can see it sorting, but I only find it useful if I don't have any coin wrappers in the slots so that I can see when each roll is filling up.I gave this 4 stars because I wish it had an AC adapter. It only runs on batteries. The last one I had, had an AC adapter, but I would prefer to buy the batteries for this machine since it works so much better!"
1,"sold as new, looks like used","This book was supposed to be a new copy, unfortunately it looks more like a used copy. Frumpled and bent. Disappointed."
5,First Rate,"""Drancy"" combines survivor interviews, voice-overs, historians' judgments, and exquisitely haunting music into an unforgettable hour. The devil of collaboration was in the terrible details, which emerge here in a most touching and persuasive way."
2,Makes my fine hair gummy,"I bought this product to replace Redken's discontinued Solve line. Solve, a clay-based shampoo, left my hair incredibly soft, with lots of volume.Aveda's Pure Abundance, however, weighed my hair down and made it difficult to comb when wet."
3,Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Shampoo,"This is a fine product for soft,shining and healthy hair. I only gave it 3-stars because it did not seem to give my fine, shoulder-length hair very much volume. Would work wonderful for someone with thicker hair."
2,Check it out in person first!,"I highly suggest you smell this shampoo in the store before purchasing. I usually take a risk when I read reviews about scent, but don't do it this time! This shampoo is strong! My husband equated it to a pack of menthol cigarettes, it is *NOT* for everyone. Also hopefully your mileage may vary, but the sales clerks in the Aveda store were pushy and rude - just something to be aware of!Still, I overlooked all of this because I am on the quest for a volumizing shampoo with natural ingredients. At first I was super impressed with this shampoo. My flat hair was much more lively after only a few uses! However, after a couple of weeks my hair started looking not only flat but stringy, and I had to use more and more product to get the original results. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so expensive! Needless to say the price combined with the smell put me off of this product."
2,should have looked at in store,"The shampoo works fine, but it has a very different smell that I was not expecting. It smells kind of woodsy/spicy."
4,Hours of Entertainment,"My four year old daughter can sit for hours with her Sweet Sounds Loving Family Dollhouse, and all the furniture options just make it all the more fun for her. Furniture sets like this one really gives her the opportunity to let her imagination fly, arranging her dolls for family time, watching the tv or else family dinners around the table, another furniture set. The only down side of these furniture sets is the limited amount of space afforded by the dollhouse itself to place it in."
5,Something other than Potatoes-Rice-Stuffing,"Polenta has started to really come into our diets, and even now we have the quick fix mixes, the packaged rolled variety ready to cut and grill. The Italian invasion is upon us and we're loving it.Here is a beautiful little book which really gives us a great resource to enhance our use of this corn based delight in so many ways -- small pizzetta, grilled plenta crostini (one of my favorites with smoked trout and mascarpone), Polenta Lasagne, and one borrowed from Rockenwagner's cookbook (which Brigit helped bring to press) Polenta Fries.This book will not only give the clues to turn out delicious polenta of all varieties but will expand our usage of this delightful side dish ever more. Mail order sources and great color photos abound."
4,Fab book,"I've made about 6 different recipes and they are all wonderful! One in particular, soft polenta with braised sausage sauce, has become my stand-by polenta recipe."
4,Nice Read,"This was a nice read, but not good for a book club discussion. The book includes some awesome stories that makes you feel good about love. The only thing we didn't like was that all of the stories were written in another (older) time period. It would have been good if the stories could have reflected modern times."
2,Lots of Variety But More Gimmicks Than Muscle,"Speed of play is extremely slow, even on Windows 98 with lots of RAM and plenty big hard drive.These slots seem to be set up primarily for visual displays and do a good job for this, but the total lack of the ability to speed up the action is frustrating. Cardoza needs to incorporate a mechanism to increase the speed of the spinning reels (preferably within the control of the player).I consider this problem serious enough to forego any further purchases of Cardoza products."
1,Avery Cordaza's 100 slots 2000,The slot machines ALL seem to run in slow motion. I just boughta brand new computer so I can't blame the computer. I [received a replacement copy and] I still have the same problem. I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone. It's just a waste of time and money.
4,Great fun and entertaining,Graphics are very clear and colorful. Quite a lot of different slot games to play several hours if you wish. The progressive slots however takes a long time to hit any payouts but the 3 Zodiac games are excellent and I play them most of the time.I wish they have them in the casino slot world.
4,Chasing the Frontier; Scots-Irish in Early America,"I absolutely loved this book. I found a lot of general history that I found very interesting regarding how the Scots-Irish, Scots & Irish really helped settle this country. I think many would be surprised at how much they helped shape this country."
4,Good Overview,"This is a good overview of the Scots in Colonial America. Particularly good information about the Scots in Ireland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina. I would have liked to read more about South Carolina. Worth the money. A good starter book."
4,Chasing the Frontier: Scots-Irish in America,"Good book may have spent too much time on some families, but outlines the Scots-Irish pretty well."
5,Great Price Great Sound!!,"WOW! Am I impressed with these speakers! ... Gaming sound is an experience worth having. Just the right rumble and boom from the woofer and the small speakers are clear and lack distortion at the highest volume settings (how do they do that?). I did find that DVD volume was lower than I liked but I think it may have been the output of the DVD itself. Gaming sound made my wife SLAM the door of the computer room when that rocket plane took off in RTCW. It shook the floor!!! Get these. ... Good job Boston, as usual."
3,Great Hype,Its an ok speaker system for 4 little tweaters but to be honest when it comes to loud sounds weather in game or music of what ever you get a lot of distortion.
2,If only...,With this horrible yet extremely Techno/David Guetta music coming out now I really wish I had held on to this program...A former friend of mine put me on to it the same way that he put me on to the original Hip Hop eJay program and because of my lack of enjoyment in that style of music I barely paid it any attention. There were a couple of loops in there that I liked but overall the software was not for me...Fast forward to now and that style of dance/techno music is huge in today's music and I could be cashing in on it or at least using some of those sounds in my more straighforward urban hip hop productions. You live and you learn I guess!!!
1,Not compatible w/ most computers....,"I have almost all of the programs. Well they stopped working and now all the discs are just junk. Do yourself a big favor and don't buy this or you will regret it big time. Better to spend more money and find a product that will do more and will not stop working when you try to install it later. Waste of good money. Also, you have to buy the discs in order and all of them to get most of the sound pieces to work, so I rest my case when you could just buy one software package and make sure your computer or laptop will support it."
3,not too bad,"this software isn't too bad for starting up. but once you start making songs, you'll come to realize that it's quite hard to make a song with only sixteen tracks. but for sure is nice for begginers."
4,C'MON DANCE!!,This is program is recommended to all the people use all the other EJAY programs. I have this program and the Dance program. Talkin' 'bout buying dance music on audio CDs. Make you own MP3s and burn them to CD.
4,Not a bad start,"Techno Ejay was my first try at making my own Techno. It'spretty versatile, and easy to get started with. It has all of themajor features that all the various music sequencer software packages do, plus a HUGE library of sounds already included that you can experiment with.One gripe would be that it doesn't allow you to edit .wav files with zoom-in/out-in-time and cut-and-paste. On the other hand, this thing has so many features, it may just be in there somewhere.There is also no drum kit, and it doesn't have a filter sweep tool, so you're pretty much stuck with the pre-made samples or the simple melody generator. But, there are so many samples provided that you'll spend days playing with variations before you get to the point where you feel the need to make your own.All-in-all, this was a good investment in my opinion. Not the whole enchilada, but a great way to get exposed to the technology without spending a lot."
2,Good for kids 8 to 14,A good and incredibly simple to use piece of software. My copy didn't come with a manual or a help file on the CD yet i made a few very nice songs. Though for anyone who really wants to play around and sample and make techno music Sonic Foundry sells much better titles which allow more manipulation and over all compatibility. Being very into music I found this title very limiting and in the end not worth using. However if you don't intend to spend time(5hours) regularly making music this may work for you.
3,Good book,This is a good book! This book is good for my 3rd grade classroom. My students really liked this book.
2,Green and Red Pixels invade,"I have returned the 19"" monitor twice. The first time there were green pixels invading the dark areas and the second time there were red pixels invading the dark areas. The green and red pixels made it hard to read some text and view video or photos. I have just received the monitor back from repair and there is still a red pixel problem. Beware of the LCD pixel problems. I don't know if it is just ViewSonic or if other LCD models have the same problem."
4,"Great monitor, but with ""hissing"" noise","This is a great monitor. I have nothing to complain about its imaging quality, and the speed is fast. Contrast is excellent, color is brilliant. Also, it has integrated speakers. However, it is also its drawback - the speakers make a very tiny ""hissing"" noise, which sometime bothers me."
3,tv stand,"It arrived in mint condition, however, it was difficult to put together and then one of the legs broke off because you have to put it together upside down and then tip it over. Crazy way to do things in my book. Who the heck engineered this piece of work? Stand looks good except for the block of wood center front instead of the leg that should be there."
